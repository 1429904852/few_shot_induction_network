i worked out denise austin several years because i think she gives good workout but i cannot stand her way-too-perky personality . i very disappointed this dance workout . setting fun colorful music great , but far workout ... this dvd really stinks . i found some steps somewhat confusing ( but i am not very coordinated ) . this workout more " indoor walk " style workout ( like walk away pounds w/ leslie sansone , etc . ) . if you looking fun way get up move , this may you . but , this not anyone looking cardio intense workout	-1
whoever made this film obviously trying impress upon viewer idea artists deep complex people . but all i see film low life drug addict losers who sit around ( few them seem jobs ) party all day . main character ( sid ) pseudointellectual who claims she majored critical theory college ( ultra liberal nonsense which goal undermining western culture pave pathway marxism ) . film appeals naive youth	-1
okay , i gave pretty bad review this dvd originally because it didn't play right . but after viewing it without technical problems , i would like say it pretty good program given rarity subject matter , good addition any collection . ancient muscle conditioning ? not many dvd out there subject . i've edited my original review it won't allow me give it more stars , but i'd give it 4 . sorry , mr. keen , if i cost you sales this . i commend you putting this out	-1
i couldn't watch this till end . bad production values , gimmicky , desperate make point violence voyeurism evil wanting make it evah so clevah while my neurons slowly commit suicide ï¿½nnui . if you wanna go all deep thoughts violence still get shaken - both intelectually viscerally - try something like miike " ichi killer " . makes this movie look so , so needless . leading man looked geeky occasionally cute . 2 stars eye candy	-1

they just don't movies like this anymore . this not movie makes charlie sheen or tom berenger appeal young audiences who like flashy stars sceen . this amovie show you reality war experiences happened people past . charlie sheen stars man who volutarily goes war . this seems odd he figures out why everyone looking him so weird when he telling them this later movie . he finds out alright . keith david plays his friend who tries keep his spirits up this definitely his best role . he cheers him up great scene where they get extremely baked . supporting cast this movie unbelievable no flat performances here . overall this my favorite movie all time . it stood test time never fails when i want see good movie . i just old special edition , not 20th anniversary but extras very nice . it commentary direcotor seperate one military advisor who worked film . there also lengthy doumentary making when i saw this i mroe than glad i got special edition . you would nto believe what actors went through ! it great making .	1

philip noyce very smart filmmaker . once more he confirms it through this intense intriguing psychological picture around notable expert forensic ( denzel washington ) sadly bedridden quadriplegic who joins forces witty female agent ( angelina jollie ) intend all their means get mysterious serial killer around low belly nyc . smart clues , notable shots , first rate direction , kinetic script make this movie one five most solid thrillers nineties according tradition silence lambs well underneath homage " rear window " , if you carefully establish visible connections , due if james stewart visible peeping tom those times , denzel washington scrutinizing cyber eye . paradigm remains , just form changes . highly recommended .	1
" sentinel " isn't movie i entirely expected like , although i've wanted see it since it theatres . even though plot different , it kept bringing mind movie released this year called " firewall . " even while watching this movie , i thought it similar " firewall " many ways ... but i also found myself entertained it . now presidential assassination movies almost cliche now ; but few good ones come around . my favorite movie this kind " line fire . " it entertaining , well acted , made sense , great film . sentinel good performances , it entertaining , but it doesn't always make sense . it never really explained why people this film want kill president . even if they just want it it , they could've told us . inside man told us bankrobbers just wanted it beginning . anyway , oscar winner michael douglas ( best actor , ' wall street ' ) plays pete garrison , secret service agent who once took bullet ronald reagan . years later , pete affair first lady ( kim basinger ) odds his former best friend david breckinridge ( marvelous kiefer sutherland ) , also secret service agent . see david under impression pete affair his wife . anyway , through rat , pete discovers there mole secret service who helping terrorists plot kill president . same time , pete getting anonymously blackmailed his affair first lady , result , evidence piling up fact pete maybe mole . now entire secret service after him , including david his new partner jill ( eva longoria , who got some good acting chops away wisteria lane ) . this movie its share cliches . there few times where i watching this movie thinking myself " sounds/looks familiar . " i saw end coming mile away . but , ending quickly redeems itself ( my point-of-view anyway ) relationship pete first lady not going direction you'd think . lot people won't like this film reasons i've mentioned more ... but if you want some semi-mindless entertainment ( although this movie its smart characteristics blending its flaws ) , then sentinel actually pretty good way pass time . due its flaws , only fact i enjoyed it support my case , i should give it 4 stars ... but i think it worthy enough 5 . entertainment goes long way . grade :	1
well , finally we've reached end " yellow brick road " ourselves great dvd release this awesome concert out oz , nov 1993 . i love how this band still gives fans what they want ( check : need lol ) release great great great dvd their live shows ! i mean , i am prince fan also ( not much i i 14)and guy barely let out any his spectacular concert shows ! ( " syracuse ' 85 " , " sign o ' times " , " rave 2000 " , now " alladin live " --- that it ?? ) out vhs or dvd . " alladin " " rave " only dvd releases , well officially anyways . u2 could would put out live anthology boxed set - 1979-2006 if they wanted it would not culled any their already released live dvd/vhs releases(ie " zoomerang sydney " , " popmart mexico city " etc)i mean mind boggles possibilities ! but what come out quality quantity ! i mean they put out fabulous " chicago 2005 " show last year ( same year it recorded -in may ! ) there talk " vertigo tour " dvd ( forgot what show -i wanna say mexico city ) this year too ! i mean we u2 fans it too damn good ! i know forthcoming " popmart " dvd release due probably next year . like this dvd they put out great transfer fun bonus material really capture " era " it represented . " zoo tv " " popmart " both my two favorite tours , even though i never got myself u2 concert until november 2001 transcendent experience ! same " vertigo nov 2005 " , but show not high standard left big stadium tours . these guys still deliver . wait patient " red rocks 1983 " too it come out soon i think ! when it , expect same love care given out men u2 !!!	1
beatles accomplished so much - good music , good recording capturing their magic , good transferring their personalities appeal onto film . help ! meant fun it some slapstick elements mostly due ringo abilities straight man . he always most honest one he holds film together . if anyone feels he didn't much others , then this film evidence contrary . beatles ' humour style incorporates elements goons peter sellers , who friend theirs . enjoy this silly film marvel best songs it .	-1
i grabbed this flick shelf very wet miserable day my local target .... craving summer sun needing island vacation .... cover appealled me these reasons i admit i not all disappointed movie . scenery indeed spectacular . underwater diving/snorkling scenes clear , crisp , just what doctor ordered . even sharks rays made it all quite beautiful . ok , enough shallow stuff .... movie indeed much like 70 flick " deep " which i enjoyed back then well . characters jared sam pretty believable - poor , honest , happy folks ( most us would love really this happy - let face it ! ) introduction bryce ( played scott caan ) really created interesting balance characters how each reacted many dangers , twists , etc . overall , bikinis buff guys added adventure many us would love our generally boring lives . would i want deal tiger sharks ? no , but little excitement would beat heck out my boring 9-5 job every day .	-1

i just kid when this show ... i loved every episode it . back then , it looked sleek , chic , exciting , everything you could ask tv show ... just like charlie angels ... or vega$ ... i remember them all ... almost 30 years later , it looks so dated ... so different today fast paced , violent , end-twisting , loud , in-your-face tv . still we love it . stories so simple ... wagner powers so much charm ... so much style . let me add today i guess i still secretly dream 1978 mercedes-benz yellow wagon big telephone ( laughs ) . it used so super cool !!! wathing those episodes made me feel again like 6 year-old kid just introduced late 70 television - jokes , kitchens , hairdos , telephones , vcrs , big cars , disco ... oh , i loved mark snow theme . i recognized it instantly ... max introduction mr. mrs. ... whose hobby murder !!! you want know what dreams middle class ' during late 70 ? watch hart hart . everything great . everything ideal ! what great show ! thanks memory . ps ... someday , someone write history american society through 20th century tv shows ' point view . i'm sure hart hart , charlie angels , moonlighting , magnum pi ( many many others)will all lot say . classic !!!!!	1
nick devlin ( lee marvin ) , enforcer chicago mob , sent kansas city collect debt rancher meat packer named mary ann ( gene hackman ) . mary ann sent mob run things down there now claims fiefdom his own . previous enforcers dealt way appropriate mary ann chosen industry . nick takes his trusted driver three mob goons him collect money . upon their arrival , they find mary ann presiding over livestock auction , but livestock this auction meat packer second source income , prostitution . nick rescues poppy ( sissy spacek ) , drugged out young woman , they leave . neither nick or mary ann give other , leaving only one conclusion . " prime cut " directed michael ritchie , made 1972 , new film me . recently , ebert roeper featured number lee marvin films new dvd . i never fan marvin , but films looked intriguing so i gave few try also revisited " professionals " , one my favorite films starring burt lancaster lee marvin . it important remember film made 1972 because it strikes viewer dated . shortly after nick rescues poppy , he buys her dress ( she naked livestock auction ) they go dinner fancy restaurant his hotel . poppy new dress little hide her breasts , but she seems blissfully unaware older men women restaurant stare her . all time , nick poppy ignore them , trying conversation . everything this scene screams early 70s me , their conversation `subtle ' look class . later film , nick his goons arrange meet mary ann local county fair collect money . this sequence introduced series close ups man walking stilts , children laughing , etc ., all meant disorient viewer before letting them become familiar new setting . again , very 70s . there many sequences film which strange , unusual interesting , ultimately making film worth watching . opening sequence ; mary ann demented brother , weenie ( gregory walcott ) gets rid one mob enforcers ( perhaps most memorable scene ) , harvesting machine chasing nick poppy through corn field , ritchie seems paying homage hitchcock it works . action scenes interesting hold your attention . even scene set corn field , which close enough called rip off famous chase hitchcock " north northwest " ; ritchie adds little touch end make it memorable interesting . you won't able stop watching it . when story turns more sedate matters everything relies actors , film less successful . marvin seems most comfortable portraying mobsters , generals cowboys throughout his career . his demeanor well-suited these types roles . he merely stare most men they surrender . this persona works well this character . but when nick supposed human , it doesn't work . when nick takes poppy dinner , it isn't clear if nick trying romance poppy or become her supportive " uncle " . she clearly seems flirting him but nick doesn't seem return favor . thankfully . this point marvin 47 ( wow , he looks older . but i guess he always . ) spacek 22 . not very age appropriate . this scene works if poppy flirting nick ; he just saved her life prostitution her life pretty screwed up point . but it would creepy watch marvin nick putting moves younger actress . gene hackman always interesting watch . villain name mary ann going fairly menacing . hackman follows occasional outbursts quick smile or joke , trying hide his true menace . this performance reminded me exactly lex luthor makes this character seem all more like dry run villain he would play " superman " films beginning 1978 . sissy spacek good , her first starring role , but part very traditional take female sidekick so prevalent action films . great performance , check out her later work " bedroom " . " prime cut " memorable exercise action filmmaking . two sequences film stay me long time . you figure out which ones ?	-1
how you twist turn most obnoxious individual completely disgusting job into hero ? black magic . after some time you begin wish him well feel tempted light up . this lovely satire political correctness , lobbyism , corruption draws you into unbearable lightness smooth talking . if you argue correctly , you not wrong , right ? eckhart perfect main part ; there many nice smaller parts , but my favorite little boy playing hero son . boy deserves nomination best supporting actor . actually he looks like scarlet little brother sometimes . they related	1
i read book then re-read book . i saw movie not once but twice . it somewhat different book . i like pollock lot , his movies so interesting me i could'nt wait movie come out . acting well only one flaw . casting tom cruise this otherwise well developed movie . everyone else great job acting here . me though , tom miscasted . he seems out place . his thinking good his intentions what character suppose but he just did'nt click what sidney wanted character . sorry cruise fans he wasted far i am concerned . gene hackman , well ed harris they well . great movie but could better without cruise here	-1
i read book before i saw movie . i am committed , devout catholic christian also , but i never read book or saw movie anything more than exciting fiction ... i think all bashing alarmismfrom religious right " overblown media many christian community who gladly mined book movie themselves profits ... ( witness all " anti-davinci " books , movies audio tapes . ) if you secure your faith book film should not affect you . it didn't me ... it actually led me read more bible patristic fathers church . film , well , book probably one " best " i've ever read . i expected disappointed movie , but " not " . i thought tom hanks cast great . don't miss it ! unless course , you feel it offensive ... thinking adults we should all decide ourselves . atreides	-1
i am diehard aitf fan since it first aired so i don't care extras or digital remasterings . what shown dvd includes footage hasn't aired thirty years because it trimmed out so they could show more commercials syndicated reruns . this series seminal piece television history . current political climate hypersensitivity political correctness series like this could never produced it sad commentary how low american culture declined . i don't know what holding up dvd releases but i would snap up entire series plus abp boxed set second i wish how they would just release this series	-1

" brother brother " packs lot ambition into its compact running time . director rodney evans interwoven modern-day story perry , young gay african-american artist ( anthony mackie ) living new york , struggling find love sense identity , nothing less than brief film history birth harlem renaissance literary movement , its seminal figures langston hughes , wallace thurman , zora neale hurston bruce nugent shown black-and-white flashbacks . aged , destitute but still witty unbowed nugent ( roger robinson ) befriends perry present becomes his touchstone . " brother brother " perhaps its best flashbacks , which vividly capture excitement sense limitless possibility briefly existed nugent his compatriots they founded radical literary journal " fire ! " they make one want know more these people . present-day narrative its virtues well , shedding light special problems gay african-americans well struggle maintain one artistic identity integrity . frankness which male/male sex treated , without prurience or heavy guilt , most welcome . curiously , reviewer mentioned , however , couplings shown almost exclusively involve black white men , which undercuts film contention black gay men should celebrate their uniqueness . moreover , evans ' protagonist too many issues contend -- homophobic parents classmates , trying make living painter , boyfriend troubles -- everything fit comfortably within short allotted time . finally , it must said actor greater emotional range than mackie may able bring out more facets perry , who too often seems merely handsome , glum cipher . still , despite its flaws , " brother brother " succeeds illuminating corners human experience long neglected mainstream filmmaking , this certainly merits praise	-1

this interesting informative dvd gain broader view how media operates , especially during runup iraq war . however , it so jam-packed information it occasionally seems gloss over important points or scenarios . there some segments i would liked schechter elaborated few which could presented more clearly . member younger generation this dvd great because it provides informed picture just how much media bed government . me , it tied lot loose ends together my head gave me broader view how mass media functions . i disagree reviewer schechter movie too much . he narrating his own point view he stayed out way when it appropriate .	-1

i love jeff goldblum , but he didn't carry this film . film ruined me second julane moore ( yuck ! ) ridiculous , lame token black daughter goldblum showed up no doubt satisfy nauseating political correctness hollywood all expense this bust film . it obviously too much ask white protagonist actually white daughter . what concept . it just added disbelief characters ( stay goldblum ) , storyline , ultimate letdown this much anticipated sequel . jurassic park iii wasn't much better	-1
movie aside , this dvd set great . there two versions this film choose this dvd ; original , directors cut . i loved new version added scenes ( even though they aren't significant plot it nice able watch them ) . additional bonus features extensive , rodriguez cooking class also quite fun . movie ... it sheer genius . i don't always love rodriguez work but when he gets it right it doesn't get much better . this movie my favorite film 2005 . fact frank miller co-director shines through results . this movie follows original graphic novels ( which i would also highly recommend ) scene scene . it like graphic novel came life . use black white , mixed flashes color makes this one most visually innovative films i ever seen . fact it not even mentioned academy ( technical merit if nothing else ) inexcusable . major strength this film like other successful adaptations ( i.e. lord rings ) source material first rate . when basis film good frank miller graphic novels it makes it hard go wrong - when miller himself helps direct it makes it almost sure thing . not gush , but i think no major flaws this film - acting , directing , cinematography , script , plot ... everything perfect . if you haven't seen this film , or read original graphic novels , yourself favor check this out .	1

just any movie featuring howard keel likely among very best late mgm musicals , this version oft-adapted broadway classic shows you why . he plays gaylord ravenal , " tennessee ravenals , " river gambler dandy who loses his steamboat ticket game wanders down riverside try con his way aboard cap'n andy hawks ( joe . brown ) showboat " cotton blossom . " there he meets , instantly falls , captain daughter magnolia ( usually known nolie ) , romantic aspiring actress played kathryn grayson , frequent face 1950 mgm films .

" besides gorgeous music -- which itself reason enough own rewatch this movie ( i always sing my two favorite pieces , " ol ' man river " " you love , " even though i keep adjusting my pitch ! ) -- lavish production values make it superior example last glory days greatest musical studio ever grace hills hollywood ; opening sequence , when " cotton blossom " pulls one many river towns draws stampeding crowd men , women , children , old young , black white , even delightedly watched two " shady ladies " lacy wrought-iron balcony , one best scenes it .

my new year resolution see bunch movies i'd always intended see but continually seemed miss . somewhat belatedly i'm fulfilling my resolution , which why i finally saw westworld . although it somewhat dated , i surprised how much i enjoyed this . film concerns delos , resort future allows guests visit either three theme parks where behavior frowned upon modern world engaged without repercussion . guests engage orgiastic sex , feasting heavy drinking , killing opponents just sheer fun it . one choose doing this roman world , medieval world , or westworld . film focuses primarily two visitors westworld , played richard benjamin james brolin . this one last sci-fi films made before onset personal computer , yet one first actually utilize computers making it . according one book i recently read , cgi representing vision field gunslinger robot first use computers generate images film history . so , this way it could considered cutting edge . other hand , when things start going wrong number robots , head technology delos describes ailment " disease . " today we'd obviously describe this virus their software . " westworld " clearly stock warner brothers western set used approximately same time blazing saddles . this works well film it gives viewer image seems weirdly familiar ( though understandably familiar , since it used dozens movies hundreds television episodes ) . so visitors park get pretty much western experience prior media would conditioned them expect . even bad guys seem familiar . yul bryner , instance , wears exactly same outfit he wore when he starred magnificent seven . visitors quickly fall into routine , james brolin doing obvious imitation clint eastwood richard benjamin quickly breaking out mold somewhat nerdy lawyer . they visit local brothel , kill robot played yul bryner couple times , get arrested break out jail shoot sheriff , get drunk middle huge brawl . then things go wrong major scale , robots going killing spree . highpoint film long chase richard benjamin yul bryner . remake westworld currently development . i am normally opposed remakes . most part remakes pale imitations originals , even case most sci-fi films . remakes invasion body snatchers inferior original , while original planet apes vastly superior remake . but this one instance where , if correctly , remake could improve upon original . film well , but it made well before computers came dominate cultural life . result , computerized control room looks absurdly primitive . instance , there no keyboards , but only consoles buttons switches knobs . danger , course , going overboard special effects . temptation all too often go overboard cgi spectacular effects ; such cases story sacrificed spectacle . my hope they keep this under control keep enhancements minimum . all all , this very enjoyable different sci-fi film . it directed written michael crichton i couldn't help but think throughout it how similar overall premise crichton creation : jurassaic park . both deal things going wrong technologically advanced theme parks . substitute dinosaurs robots or vice versa you essentially same movie .	-1
this wonderfully creepy movie . one my favorites .	1
i watched this movie no particular bias wal-mart . i understand this movie made same way political ads , where they try really hard skew facts make viewer emotional reaction half story provided . i think most people it highly effective , but it didn't work me . i think this excellent movie show example skew , perspective , propaganda . when they talk sweatshops china honduras i found myself -- though i dont envy workers -- laughing movie . i used live china i many factories conditions they make seem exclusive universal over there . it film makers then ex-employees ( they assuming viewers ) who putting their cultural assumptions how sad it they work so hard get paid so little , but other countries fact life nothing wal-mart . cultural governmental problem within countries where factories exist , not only problem wal-mar t.t he movie also discuss how wal-mart employees burden government because fact wal-mart pays very little then suggests it employess go public assitance , but truth same fast-food companies everywhere else pays minimum wage offers little benefits . i believe wal-mart should morally proivide their employees more wages provide more full-time positions , but business culture expands well past wal-mart . i am teacher who cannot work more than 17 hours week so they not give me benefits , but i don't see anyone trying make movies ban schools .	-1
first episode near end ( good ep ! ) freezes up becomes pixelated , second episode not even begin . i just watched third episode it played fine , but i exchange this . i buy this preowned shop but i don't think problem ( discs spotless ) . i seen this variety freezing up it almost certainly due double sided discs . i say out two eps . i seen i am sad murphy gone . i like anti-chemistry them but i see also how one season enough it . we all knew there no way remington not going get girl anyway . i truly like doris roberts lot this show she seems perfect fit , plus she very good actress . watch part episode 3 when she telling rem she let him down wants quit ; if those aren't geniune tears ... i'm remington steele :) might i add ; there really really really needs soundtrack released this series . first episode acapulco amazing soundtrack themes stuff legend . anyone listening out there record land ?	-1

... which more than i say modern couple . if you expect see gwyneth paltrow take her clothes off , don't bother this movie . she plays frigid arrogant scholar , which not too much stretch her . my opinion , she not romantic damsel-in-distress material . she much more interesting when she plays cold cynical characters . jennifer ehle , other hand , shows quite bit skin . clandestine love scene two poets still stands before my eyes . i read book , so i could tell movie left too many loose ends untied . instance , it not clear movie why gwyneth paltrow character crying .	-1
this way comedy should done- warm , funny , hear t-t ouching , little craziness thrown . hector elizondo raquel welch perfect- he understated , she over top ... just like movie . story never bogs down , but zips right nicely . sisters bicker , their father worries , hortensia ( welch ) her best snag him , we laugh . great fun ! note rating parents like me who wonder pg13 rating ( one never tell these days ! ) : there one woman shown skimpy underclothing , one sex scene sexual references jokes , so this would not suitable kids	1
there few movies which warrant 5 star rating me . if i could give trainspotting 10 stars i would . me , movie stay you long after credits roll . it make you think feel . it subject you roller coaster ride emotions . trainspotting delivers goods . so many described movie what it , i am not going . suffice it say movie make you cry , piss-your-pants laugh , think , cheer wildly discuss it your friends years after you first saw it . i remember nagging feeling i needed take shower after seeing it . , my friends , sign great movie . great feature trainspotting soundtrack . it features many my favorites , iggy pop , lou reed , etc . soundtrack perfect this movie . everytime i hear lust life iggy pop now , i automatically think trainspotting . sign great movie . if only it would get criterion release ...	1
bob roberts relevant today it some fourteen years ago . converting ideological outsiders not seem its primary goal . it echo chamber entertainment meant only already committed leftist . needless point out , this not exactly surprising . tim robbins , after all , who starred , directed , even sang film one hollywood best know radical personalities . blunt , he less talented oliver stone . script turns conservatives into cartoon characters . there no attempt whatsoever try understanding their world view . they simplistically portrayed fascists seeking any excuse justify taking over country . bob roberts ( tim robbins ) republican u.s. senatorial candidate hoping defeat incumbent pennsylvanian democrat brickley paiste ( gore vidal ) . he vile not above using dirty tricks achieve his aims . story unfolds , roberts well behind polls . leftist journalist portrayed giancarlo esposito tries further derail roberts ' campaign revealing his drug running other criminal activities . he successful ? journalist representing small left-wing publication take down rich powerful ? you not glued your seat due suspense , but story line isn't complete bore . if nothing else , you see countless well known motion picture stars come go throughout story . you ever wonder why far-left became unglued over iraqi liberation 2003 ? well , bob roberts should help enlighten you . it makes numerous references desert storm , our first invasion iraq 1991 . conflict allegedly conspiracy concocted devious right-wing " national security council . " this group really runs country , not our elected leaders . republican administration george bush 41 only wanted dominate region . our greedy military-industrial complex satisfied , would not take no answer . saddam hussein not adolph hitler --- but minor league dictator . senator brickley paiste dismisses him merely member " villain month club .

this wonderful film which gets 10 my rating scale . one marks enduring film me characters continue life -- they still live -- after film ended . i like many movies , but very few created such way impart self-contained life people within movie . pelle conquerer such movie . films john cassavetes also create characters which continue live -- gena rowland character " woman under influence " or man trying revive his lover who taken overdose " faces " . these characters aging father played marvelously max von sydow his son , pelle , live !! i felt i absolutely there after my visitation -- they all continuing their lives	1
when this came out i really not know what it so i ignored it watched other movies . one day i rental store i looking around i seen it shelf so i took chance got it finally after all these years . this movie suprised me because i not think it would good because young writers matt damon ben affleck new not any experience all . story good it worked some how . i recommend people who not seen take look it those who seen good you . i bought movie after i rented it but i recommend people rent then make decision	1
roger ebert called this film one most powerful movies he'd ever seen . yeah , i guess it . this movie , directed hughes brothers(from hell , dead presidents ) portrays life hood no other movie before . it powerful , unapologetic , presents us characters we should no sympathy whatsoever . oddly enough though , we . movie begins caine ( tyrin turner ) o-dog ( larenz tate ) walking into liquor store buy some beer . store owned korean who follow them around mysteriously . caine o-dog go their business until they're walk out o-dog shoots kills both korean takes tape them doing it . scene shows us violence unflinchingly . we then see caine back story . his father ( samuel . jackson ) died drug deal his mother died heroin overdose . he lived his religious grandparents since then , most part , raised pernell ( glenn plummer ) who now serving life prison . caine , meanwhile , helps take care pernell girlfriend ronnie ( jada pinkett ) his young son anthony , who reminds caine himself young age . rest movie events happen lives caine his homieso-dog , doc , wax , sharif , stacy , lew-loc , chauncy . drug deals , drive-by , rim stealing , car jacking , cold blooded murder , you name it . none it off limits . through all this , however , you like characters . o-dog , no matter how violent sadistic he gets still great sympathetic character . tate performance so good , i'm surprised he didn't get best supporting actor oscar nomination . tyrin turner , who i've never seen movie , amazing caine ; playing both violent street thug sensitive guy perfectly . pre-will smith , jada pinkett also great ronnieand should gotten oscar nomination best supporting actress . this important movie needs seen lot people , since it confronts lot social issues simalar way movies like american history , boyz hood , even scarface before . hughes brothers crafted masterwork , powerfully entertaining movie . grade : a+	1
this film bit over analyzed . when i first saw film , i really didn't care analytical makeup film , but more intrigued story very troubled teenager : donnie ( jake gyllenhaal ) . very original script , great acting , film bit difficult label genre . so i won't label it . donnie living his own reality this film , although i not seen director cut , nor i wish , original very good it . when donnie begins seeing six-foo t-t all rabbit , you know there problem . help his psychiatrist , medications , family trying help him , donnie still out reach . donnie fascination time-travel also very good concept film ; because viewer , you're not sure if this his reality , or if his reality manipulated . me , i saw donnie young boy who troubled . much film leaves you wondering , i like films sometimes . not all time , but it works this film . this very good film . highly recommended viewers . look number reviews however , it appears quite few people liked film . [ well some who not ] . i don't claim expert knowing all hidden meanings film , [ nor one needed ] however , one who like good films , recognize very good film , this film definetly classic one . part patrick swayze particular , so-called self-help guru , very good . donnie even his state mind able recognize charlton manipulator . film comes you different directions , everyone see something different film , however , me , one part stands out very much six-foot-rabbit . i believe if i saw six-foot rabbit looked like donnie , i'd run like hell .	1
this one my all-time favorite movies . read book if you want backstory since screenplay starts half point . it entertaining that why we see movies first place , right ? matt damon just so darn likeable , you get drawn into his narration right off bat . screenplay very well . it coppola film , after all ... he work some talented people . it very nice see theresa wright this film , well .	1
this great film preceded onset " jlo . " " out sight " great showcase jennifer lopez talent actress . it shame she hasn't presented more great roles , like karen sisco , this film . karen d.a , who carries rifle jaded attitude . she chance encounter charming , compulsive bank robber jack foley ( george clooney ) . their encounter made especially intriguing because it takes place following his would-be kidnapping sisco her own car . it no surprise sparks fly ..... however , this doesn't downplay complexities their star-crossed encounter . some greatest strong points this film include juxtaposition flashbacks , incorporating trick camera work voice overs . what more , this film shot very bare bones style . we don't get sense romance , so much feeling stark reality . colors dark , dialogue characters honest , real simply wonderful . this film potential mass appeal , due fact , though it get gritty violent , doesn't downplay its intelligence or originality . violence counterbalanced genuinely funny scenes , well more introspective glimpses how characters turned out they . this definitely great date film !!	1
how he come up this crazy stuff . he tells one bizarre story after end they all tie up together . it makes no seinfeld all right . this great dvd -- enjoy	1
sixth sense unbreakable so much better than signs , i'm sorry say whatever . night shyamalan originally , he lost . when sixth sense came out , he tipped next big thing , but i'm sorry say , it no longer there . my mind , he cannot match any films up success sheer uniqueness sixth sense . signs just fails miserably . concept good idea , but execution terrible . it reminded me very much blair witch project , what little action there happens off screen , torches well . it also definitely not mel gibson best film . even actors appear struggle dialogue-heavy script , not really much happens . apart one brief glimpse alien . oooh . fascinating . problem i think signs , it already following many other , far superior , alien movies . aliens attacking earth , lots more memorable than this . there also overly religious theme , which film probably would better either toning down , or scrapping altogether . it really just thrown try justify what happening film . scenes gibson his kids his brother way too sentimental really cringeworthy . finale doesn't really make film better . discovery naked aliens find water like acid their skin atrocious ! why come earth , surface mostly covered water , atmosphere full water droplets vapour ?! then they travel millions light years far advanced technology - then can't break into wooden house ?! you kidding me ? but most ridiculous thing not only characters not pay attention dogs , who sensed something not right ( time get myself dog ) , but fact all sophisticated radar equipment cannot detect aliens entering our atmosphere - but baby monitor ?! huh ?! film stay well away . thankfully , i didn't spend my hard earned ( ha ! ) money it , but borrowed it friend . i shall approach . night shyamalan films trepidation now . oh , when director decides give himself speaking role his own film , make it short one	-1

there little say this movie , since i assume people interested buying this item already seen it already . but amount quality extras this dvd just breathtaking . say least , disc 2 imax version film , which time this writing not documented here amazon . imax version , well :) , shorter version film ( 1h55 ' versus 2h20 ' regular ) aspect ratio 1:66 . so if you unsure buy widescreen or fullscreen versions , i suggest buying wide , since you get ( sort ) full screen version imax one present disc 2 . then there this documentary " conquest space " which rather dull , " astronauts story " very short but interesting clip , excellent " making " juicy commentary jim lovell , pinpointing hits misses film compared real thing . $9.90 , how you not buy this jewel	1

live stage , trevor nunn production extroardinary , one best theatre performances i ever seen . video doesn't totally capture power ; it may wise , television director , de-emphasize stage set ( black magic circle outlined wood floor , surrounded wooden crates ) , such brilliant theatrical images invading thanes , surrounding macbeth circle , he slumps crate throne his ramshackle bunker ; but those features part what made stage version unforgettable . however , video preserve wonderful performances . i must dissent some reviews below : dench superb lady macbeth late bob peck understated macduff works beautifully ; both deliver their big scenes well any production you ever see . mckellen , this signature role his career . video also conveys low-key intensity furious pace this macbeth ; it rare opportunity see one great shakespearean productions century , preserved	-1

i saw john carpenter " fog " ( 1980 ) years ago kind bored it . catching it again recently , however , i impressed quite few things : -- film mood . carpenter successfully captured fitting spooky atmosphere his ghost story . ( plot involves horrific ghosts ship lepers returning enact revenge coastal community 100 years after people village guided them rocky death order swipe their chest gold ) . spooky mood nicely captured very first scene wherein john houseman shares ghost story hushed tones group kids campfire coast . -- spectacular locations . picture filmed beautiful point reyers/bodega bay region north san francisco . -- fabulous score . especially main piano piece runs during end credits . it actually blows away more popular main score carpenter " halloween . " -- good cast , which includes adrienne barbeau , jamie lee curtis , hal holbrook , nancy kyes janet leigh . unpredictable finish . i know this horror flick people supposed die , but it nice see people not die change . it refreshing ! bottom line : if you're looking fast-paced slasher gore-fest , you not like this film . if , however , you're mood something spooky , atmospheric aesthetically pleasing , " fog " likely trip your trigger	-1
alias : season 4 . wow . characters through heck first three seasons , much it caused man named arvin sloane , afterwards group called covenant . stroke genius , now best both sd-6 cia combined into apo , headed up ( guess who ? ) arvin sloane , guy everybody loves hate . usual cast jennifer garner , michael vartan , victor garber , ron rifkin , etc . accompanied absolutely adorable mia maestro , who plays sydney half-sister nadia santos . throw some nice guest stars like angela bassett , some derevko sisters ( yes , plural ) person or two who you probably thought dead , you've got great season , culminating ultimate family team-up take down terrible rambaldi device could trigger next apocalypse ! course ... chosen one must battle passenger . only one ... survive . unless you want either one next season , which case , they might live . but i'm not sayin ' if they both survive or not , ' cause that'd spoiler . big shocker very end season , wow . let just say not everyone who they claim . now i don't know what happens season 5 , except somebody gets clip or two unloaded ' em there probably double or clone or two somewhere there . ( i saw few moments series finale ... not knowing how great show it time . ) whatever case , while i admit there creepy episode or two there , season 4 comes strong well-deserved place amongst other three seasons , all which i enjoyed . trust me , you won't let down season 4 if you enjoyed other three . i highly recommend it	1

quite astounding when it first came out , your values may changed bit since you first saw this film way back when . definitely benchmark cinema , regardless your revisionist take fellini " values " . i couple technical issues dvd ( i bought it 2001 ): 1 ) lip-synch error pervades entire disc - dialog lags actors mouths consistent noticeable fraction second . 2 ) pivotal scene film , death hermaphrodite white hot desert canyon , intentionally over-exposed film appear almost completely washed out screen . dvd production house " corrected " this exposure , which now looks muddy lacks its original magic meaning . amazon replaced my first copy - same deal . too bad either fellini wasn't well enough oversee these types technical details , or else people designated this him couldn't bothered their job . or maybe it fixed now . caveat emptor	-1

2 fast 2 furious one those sequels comes around every so often doesn't require you seen original . i saw this movie first time not too long after it came out , never seen original , i thought i would lost wouldn't enjoy myself much other people , but contrary - i left experience much happier than when i came . this film full quick one-liners deserve laugh . special effects car races leave your mouth gaping open . i heard read people didn't appreciate this film much because it seemed focus more plot than first film rather than focus more races , but overall , i think balance works well . even thinking plot we left , i really can't see time when race would even appropriate . people saying this film worse than original , i would disagree ... why ? frankly , i always firm believer than vin diesel entirely overrated actor . ( i mean , c'mon - you seen pacifier ? ) he nothing more than meat head who , while able pretty good fight scenes , should leave dialogue someone else . yes , this film younger crowd , there numerous occasions when unbelievable events take place ( take boat jumping example ) , but there no saying older person wouldn't enjoy it well ... only thing i say you really shouldn't go into this film expecting oscar worthy performance , or else you disappointed . if you sit back take this fun romp it , however , you thoroughly enjoy yourself	1

if playwright tennessee williams southern gothic writing style makes his works feel more ornately melodramatic than those o'neill or his closest contemporary arthur miller , they provide resonant showcases actors inhabiting his characters . this clearly evidenced this six-film , eight-disc collection epitomizes some most powerful acting come out hollywood 1950 early 1960 , all directed true filmmaking masters . probably because they least censored studio system least form presented now , best set elia kazan " streetcar named desire " john huston " night iguana " . others kazan " baby doll " , richard brooks ' " cat hot tin roof " , jose quintero " roman spring mrs. stone " brooks ' " sweet bird youth " . feral , smoldering marlon brando justifiably made his reputation brutish stanley kowalski 1951 " streetcar named desire " , his animalistic charisma still leaps off screen . intriguingly , one extras included two-disc set movie footage 1947 screen test brando when he 23 , his stardom seems assured even then . plot movie amounts inevitable clash kowalski his visiting sister-in-law , blanche dubois , fading southern belle verge mental breakdown . proven her ability convincing southerner " gone wind " , vivien leigh expertly handles all florid dialogue her particular blend defiance vulnerability . strong supporting work comes kim hunter blanche naive sister stella karl malden blanche seemingly respectful suitor mitch . now over ninety , malden hand provide his own eloquent recollections production alternate track , film historians rudy behlmer jeff young provide more objective commentary track . film critic richard schickel 1995 feature-length look kazan centerpiece second disk , there also more interesting five-part documentary film original broadway show , best portion focusing censorship several minutes reinserted dvd version film . 1964 " night iguana " deals similarly dysfunctional group people , but this time setting dilapidated mexican beach resort where reverend shannon , newly defrocked , taken group spinsters women college . huston made his reputation his strong literary adaptations , his affinity shows fulsome characterizations , striking visuals dark humor . richard burton peak form shannon , there also sterling work deborah kerr spinsterish hannah especially ava gardner slatternly resort owner , maxine faulk . dvd contains recent making-of featurette vintage video , both fascinating .

i saw theatrical version vhs many years ago , it didn't really make sense . i thought maybe it because it david lynch film , it wasn't supposed ... then i remembered it based frank herbert incredibly complex sci-fi classic , decided 2 hour film couldn't coherent . then i taped tv 4 hour version ; editing commercials , it came 3 hours . there narration someone english accent ; i couldn't understand word . then , 20 years later , dvd , lynch extended version directed alan smithee ( ed wood anonymity ) . i watched extended version other day , it entertaining . one thing new dvd : side one lynch version , side 2 ( extended ) completely unlabeled . certainly , some action scenes intriguing . sets ( background artwork ) certainly visionary , wide 2.35 : 1 lbx very well presented . also , narration different person than tv version i'd taped those years ago . i understood every word . why mr. lynch took his name off film escapes me . i actually enjoyed lot film . there especially fine performances jose ferrer , max von sydow , sting , francesca annis , dean stockwell brad dourif . kyle maclachlan used his customary stiff acting approach good advantage , carrying lead role quite well . handsome guy ... aficianados pull this film apart without mercy , herbert fans probably same , but i watch films entertained i . it not great , not always coherent , but it great put during rainy saturday afternoon . purists , stay away ; film fans sci-fi freaks , enjoy !	-1

what amazing this production even though many story elements changed , strength each story preserved it essence . i read most this series over time come love character rebus . he truly ' real ' person , all foibles warts each us . he terrible interpersonal relationships , his best when he doing everything his power , not show emotion . though he not write screenplays , ian rankin very much involved making these teleplays ( see secion making rebus his comments ) , you see his deft touch minor changes made . siobhan clark supposed attractive , her late twenties , scots/english accent ; actress who plays her none these . brian holmes nowhere found , neither dr patience aikens . but actors who plays big ger cafferty ' weasel ' spot . hannah rebus able show great understanding character , who grey tough his home city . my only complaint he little young aging rebus who should his late forties . minor complaint . plethora scots accents ; it hard enough trying guess what some words mean , without trying figure out what people saying . but , i guess they wanted authenticity since it made scottish tv , didn't care what us yanks understood . ya think i get version subtitles	1

let me start saying first movie series absolutely fantastic . regardless fact it didn't stick few key plotlines book , everyone still great job adapting original jurassic park . then came this piece trash ... whereas first movie least attempted loosely base itself book , this one just takes brilliant writing michael chrichton throws it directly out window . first off , john hammond supposed dead . he dies end first novel . secondly ian malcome supposedly dead , or least mia end first book , we join him costarican hospital opening 2nd . there no bratty daughter , entire premise much more it . most importantly ... entire ending san diego t-rex ... which possibly worst conceived plot line history movies ... not exist book ! i went into this movie expecting tightly woven plot , huge concentration conspiracy such island exist , anticipation some good dino-scenes top it off . what i ended up getting writing equivalent monkey typewriter drooling page . not only ... but because lack plot , dino scenes complete over-kill . when you see so much it , you lose awe wonder first film . when you see brachiosaur first 20 mins original film , wonderment difficult rival . there no such moments this film . if you're looking quick fix decent looking dino fx , go nuts . however , if you're looking something more substantial actual plotline , flick off dvd player pick up book . oh one more thing ... don't go near 3rd movie . they didn't even book untrue . i can't imagine how much more long-winded rambling my review would one	-1

sorry give you bad news this dvd set , but ... i love kids hall , but found complete season one dissapointing . i remember some wonderful very humorus skits season one not included this set ... such crushing head man his friend misha who interupts play he putting . actors his play his fingers . he goes crush her head , she sticks her thumb front one eye says " there no body home " , so it appears her thumb covering his head ... but this skit isn't here . why ? lover head crusher , only head crushing episodes season one when he crushes business men heads runs into little boy suit asks him " what you want when you grow up ? " little boy responds " business man ! " -- he consquently gets his head crushed . funny , but not best or most memorable head crusher . i also disspointed buddy cole this dvd set . there some wonderful buddy cole segments first season not this set ( how one when he jail his tin cup shaped like champagne glass ? ) , same chicken lady ( blind date , attending wedding bearded lady , or phone sex line ) cabbage head ( i loved it when he invited himself join bunch women who trying dinner , he sits lawn chair sex book asks questions ) . i also loved skit where woman ( played one kids drag ) sits outdoor cafe , annoyed terrible waiter suffers further aggravation " dirty man standing behind fence " who trying bum cigarettes " his kids " her . or , how guy stubbed his toe doesn't want go doctor because he found colors his infected toe " interesting ! " not one these hillarious skits or episodes included season one dvd collection ... why ? god only knows who compiled collection sometimes boring comedy skits season one dvd collection , but i tell you one thing . there no way this complete collection entire season one episodes . it incomplete , say least . i just gave you many examples my favorites missing . it would great see them again them enjoy posterity . it kind humor endeared us all kids hall so much . skits included this collection probably not most popular or funny episodes . i would not recommend it . take it me ... save yourself twenty or thirty bucks . i not seen other dvd collections other kids hall seasons dvd yet . one only hope they more entertaining than season one ( or should i say , wasn't ) ... p.s. i would not even rated this dvd set one star , but it lowest rating you give item .	-1

problem this film i read book . i disappointed simply because `be cool ' obvious showcase musical talent . overly long dance sequence john travolta uma thurman prime example . somewhere bulk story lost -- there some very -- very good characters appearing film would've more intersing if somebody would've said , " hey , don't forget book ! " but true original source not hollywood strong suit . " cool " provides some popular music , some known faces , but without john travolta , movie would never made . few laughs provided . couple ironic scenes show up , but there too little sustain full-length feature . basically , project disservice everyone involved . some characters so thin -- face it -- poor christina milian linda moon , reduced voice sways when she sings -- clichï¿½ . rock best he but again , `he gay bodyguard;' he brunt insulting jokes offered up raji , his boss [ vince vaughn ] , who , book , far more sinister -- but film he idiot . course chili chili . travolta very nice job , chili obviously smartest guy room . uma thruman performance , well , not funny -- not serious , not intense -- not much -- best , she made me shrug . i like what harvey keitel nick carr , but there just not enough , all negatives reflect completely director . enough said there . my advice , watch `get shorty'again , or read `be cool . '	-1
4.5 stars this release , i am sorry they didn't actual orginal ending it seems say it packaging , bod form dvd producers . but i am not one those rabid duckie fanatics seem think even though andie duckie no chemistry they belonged together . obviously she loved him brother not potential love interest 180 least this film just wouldn't work ! if you want ending go see some kind wonderful ending two leads obvious chemistry story supports change ! people people people , entire film supposed fact labels folks put you wrong no matter what side tracks you live you still good person . but all i hear complaints how duckie didn't get girl . well folks i've never twenty years i adored this film thought he should am glad they not lucas changed film reflect . i would like seen scene however why this dvd gets 4.5 stars instead 5	-1

after i wrote this review , i read other reviews thought some much better than mine , much more expressive . specially mr. censored review , you sould read it . it posted december 2004 . important thing you read 3 or 4 reviews see nobody kidding you . this concert fantastic . ok now my unedited review : this greatest incubus dvd i've seen , greatest incubus thing i ever experienced . i've known incubus some time now i tell you its great concert , you really tell how professional band members . throughout concert you see extended versions songs , solos mike einziger jos pasillas . you experience incubus it , full energy power . you tell these guys good ' cause live versions identical recorded versions , but they special " live " feel . or should i say " alive " ? this must anyone who admires or likes incubus	1
i cannot believe how wonderful this collection . there six movies this set . all which i already my collection . however , quality 3 6 moview far surpasses anything i able find previously . " true confession " , " love before breakfast " " man world " all excellent picture sound . it my understanding there no surviving master prints " true confession " . so i congragulate person who found this high quality copy sitting somewhere back some studio vaul t.t he other three titles , " we're not dressing " , " hands across table " " princess comes across " dark prints comparison previous versions issued video cassette 1995 mca/universal , but otherwise highly watchable . sound quality these movies also excellent . this collection while you , price it steal . it well worth $100 or more	1
it hard know where begin this one . movie immaculately filmed one greatest directors all time , given just most perfect presentation i've ever seen dvd . i guess i'll start print : it magnificent , beautiful , golden colors , sharp focus , barely speck dust film . one would expect kurosawa film , composition feast eyes , beautiful formal balances coming most mundane elements shot . ( george lucas very influenced kurosawa many ways , but this sort beautiful , balanced composition one thing he never mastered . ) then there score . most people might not immediately think score when discussing kurosawa film , but i struck here how powerful distinctive it , while same time it never gets way film . then there sets : simple , yet used maximum effect . this not big budget film hollywood standards ( though it most expensive japanese film up time ) , but it feels far more epic than any recent , very expensive star wars " prequels , " which just goes show it takes more make epic than just money . kurosawa reportedly only used something like 200 horsemen , yet you'll think you're seeing far more . then there cast . tatsuya nakadai , lord ichimonji , manages perfectly portray man going man who both frightening his stubbornness sympathetic his pathos same time . not easy job , especially under ton makeup made him look far older than he . three sons , played akira terao , jinpachi nezu especially daisuke ryu ( insightful loyal saburo ) distinctive well-developed . androgynous peter ( first name billed only ) kyoami memorable his flamboyant , almost drag-queen gyrations taunting aging , increasingly senile warlord insights into his predicament . yet standout performance , one i always remember , stunning mieko harada lady kaede . while ran supposedly loose retelling king lear , kaede more lady macbeth than anything else . she two very memorable scenes both involve severed heads . while screenplay riffs lear , it also makes some notable changes . three daughters replaced three sons . this " lear " goes mad not because daughter love but because , apparently , weight wars fought past . young lord very odds image we see beginning film , man wishing make peace his demons . we discover through backstory he killed , kidnapped waged much violence bring together his kingdom , yet now he just wants peace goodwill . i thinking adage what goes around comes around , wondered if hidetora himself ever came this realization . it what he thinking he emerged burning castle after tremendous battle , dazed , wordless ? scene , shot without ambient sound but haunting score ( composed toru takemitsu ) , must go down one greatest moments film , example how cinema used way no other art form . bonus features both bountiful meaningful . first there full-length commentary film scholar stephen prince , though i confess i've not yet listened it . director sidney lumet gives brief appreciation kurosawa ran . he likens film late beethoven quartets or seventh symphony . such comparisons often come off glib or meaningless , but this actually struck chord me . i indeed think comparison ran energies seventh apt , introspection reminds me late quartets , particularly op . 132 . second disc , we a.k. , 75 minute documentary kurosawa life . ( case you've seen recent pbs documentary kurosawa , this one different . ) then comes half hour film making ran , which shows what grueling shoot it must , going every day base mount fuji often working there even night . finally there 35-minute video piece exploring costumes ran , well new video interview tatsuya nakadai ( lord hidetora ) . there also color booklet interviews kurosawa composer takemitsu . short , there enough supplementary materials here keep any fan movie or director happy weeks . many criterion releases defined what dvds , but this title just takes cake . what more could one ask , short summoning kurosawa beyond talk film ? even if you own ran one its other video versions , they all vastly inferior this release . if you've never seen film , or any work akira kurosawa , this probably best place you could start . highly highly recommended	1
this great story which wrapped entertaining sub-story well acted all . this julia best work my opinion . albert finney always favorite his role here absolutely charming . i would highly recommend this film	-1
" i'm just country lawyer " begins james steward he tries fend off very young george scott new da they try unlikeable ben gazarra murder . so why james steward , old da , take case like this ? that question i'm stuck . way , i love how otto preminger directs movie . love how he changes point-of-view how he engages us courtroom battle . brilliant staging , great performances ... all typical preminger . i believe guy raped lee remick ? yes i . i believe lee remick likes lead men hungers attention men ? absolutely ! i believe ben gazarra his " right mind " when he murdered guy ? i don't know ... anyone their " right mind " when they committ murder ? but i love this movie . ps where widescreen version	1
it indeed very nice able watch this fantastic series best quality format . however , i must agree other reviewers here who commented fact first season badly hacked . some you who may read this , but not understand what we mean , here poop . september 16 , 1970 nbc unveiled new series called " four one . " it comprised four mini-series : 1 . mccloud 2 . san francisco international airport 3 . night gallery 4 . psychiatrist each mini-series ran period six consecutive weeks . then they rerun rotation basis . they aired wednesday nights 10:00 - 11:00 . " mccloud " went " mystery movie " series , " san francisco international airport " left air " four one " series " psychiatrist . " " night gallery " spun off into it own series . disc one , " four one " episodes appear 90 minute form , combining two 60 minute episodes . what bummer ! it would really great see original " four one " opening . i seem remember square black background , they something square , moving it around or it morph into other things or something , it really hard remember because it so long ago i all 7 years old time . but , i seem remember it stopped 4 box , making it look my young mind like child block . same " mystery movie " opening . remember guy ( looked like mccloud me ) walking slowly toward camera flashlight , shining it side side shots each element series would flash up ? all while really neat whistling theme played . tv still some pretty neat things time . still , i'm glad this set . but , it would really nice original openings more importantly , first season its unaltered form .	-1
singles came out early 90 , time me , all grunge scene . i high school then so this norm us all . but i got older , i never outgrew singles . fact , i think i began relate it even more i gained more life experience . anyway , here wonderful comedy offers us all glimmer hope this overpopulated world . we meet group friends who various tennants same apartment building seattle . singles centers around cliff ( dillon ) struggling musician , his girlfriend janet ( fonda ) who put cliff needs before her own last time , linda ( sedgwick ) who thinks she found " one " until she discovers him bar girl when he told her he going back spain , steve ( scott ) who spent his dating career playing field , debbie ( kelley ) who searches mr. right via video dating service ( oh-so hilarious ) . main story linda steve meeting relationship blossoms it . if you big fan grunge when it popular you'll fall love singles ( bands like soundgarden , mother love bone , even alice chains featured ) . many funny moments abound ( this shouldn't spoil anything you should you 1 person left wyoming or something who hasn't seen this movie ) including run-in pessimistic mime ( played eric stoltz ) , debbie dating video steve story learning sex child , but that all i say without giving it all away . price this low , singles steal it something you watch again again again .	1
it hard believe , but i never heard wind willows until i 16 years old , when it first read aloud me , around glowing campfire . it instant love affair . years later , i shared classic my children . so when we found animated version book sale neighbor tag sale , we snapped it up . we've loved film ever since . animal characters -- badger , mole , toad , weasel all others -- congregate often toad hall elsewhere , story takes many delightful turns . this animated version , directed dave unwin , every bit classic book . your children surely love it much we -- including child this particular mom . -- alyssa . lappe	1
so long , i avoided working out because some really negative feelings i've attached process . i still vivid pictures my mind getting dressed dowdy gym clothes , fighting traffic , waiting use machines i wasn't really sure how use first place ! there times when i take two hours out my day just exercise less than half time . i think my gym experience might better i hired personal trainer , but let face it -- not all us money this , especially broke students like me . i little more luck treadmill some tae-bo , but found intense cardio didn't particularly agree my joints or my downstairs neighbors . ;) then , sometime few years later , i found bar method . i initially very skeptical low-impact workout because i always thought more dog-tired hyperventilated i felt after workout , better it me . ultimately , i really just setting myself up failure because every workout turned out most stressful part my day ! not so bar method . yes , exercises very , very tough killer muscles , but you aren't huffing puffing feeling sick way i always more " traditional " cardio workouts . best part i know i'm working just hard i ever burning just much fat . bar method exactly what it promises : consistent , 3-times-a-week schedule , even lazy girls like me slim their hips , flatten their abdominals , tighten their arms , define their legs . greatest surprises i just how well exercises worked my hips ( very problem area me ) my arms ( which became tight , but not all bulky . ) i designer sculpting more than fat free , but i find both workouts well-paced enjoyable . burr leonard her assistants rather likeable provide very specific directions each exercise ( good thing beginner-level students ) . so why four stars , not five ? i find music dvds little dull side . i try remedy problem listening my ipod , but found i just didn't get much workouts without burr explanations encouragements . also , i find abdominals sections both dvds leaves something little lacking me . yes , my abs get flatter , but i still didn't feel like i really " worked " them -- fact , they barely felt sore next day , unlike rest me , which positively killed . these days , i find myself doing abs section shape magazine " bikini body all year long " morning , then doing bar method sections arms , seat , thighs later day . this useful me , but might very disruptive someone who likes their workout one full chunk . i'm using other dvds now , too , but somebody who needs little bit kickstart get back into working out , bar method great way fun get fit	-1

this stirring film . robert de niro christopher walken both outstanding - this movie would not half entertaining without them . beginning , you get sense lives these young men . they free fun-loving - yet everything change them . they proud serve their country , but they exposed side life no one should ever see . scenes set vietnam during war truly intense shocking . after horrors these men witness , you not surprised see them become disenchanted distant . how you return functioning society after immersed war death most horrific kind ? it seems , tragically , most simpy can't readjust ... who hell blame them ? this movie doesn't tackle war whole . instead , it shows you very concentrated story involving only few men . you see their experiences vietnam eventual playing out their individual fates . it very disturbing see nick ( walken ) alive after all time when michael ( de niro ) returns saigon finally finds him . he shell his former self , lifeless eyes empty soul - thanks solely war . again , without christopher walken robert de niro , this movie wouldn't half good . their performances excellent	-1

" medium " instantly became my favorite show television 2005 . i usually am fascinated shows elements paranormal , which tuned me . however , it realism family relationship most fascinating . patricia arquette who " ed wood " johnny depp plays alison dubois . her emmy win best actress drama attests her standing within industry , but on-screen chemistry jake weber who " meet joe black " plays her husband joe riveting . they fight , spat , try mask conflict front their kids , juggle impossible number real-life tasks , layers humor romance make this seem like real family loves each other deals unusual circumstances alison psychic ability . i found after watching initial show when reruns would show , i still wanted watch them over episodes csi miami i not seen . when i bought dvd , i hoping there might episode i'd missed , but i'd seen them all nbc lifetime reruns several times . i'm impressed how entrancing each episode quality writing . alison dreams like clues she struggles fit together . what impresses me alison she sincerely struggles right thing . world violence , it often hard clear which way moral compass points . episode " sickness adultery " her tip places her witness stand unethical hostile prosecutor seeks embarrass her . she comes back he cheated pass his law exams cheating his wife , she finds her best defense truth . two older daughters also jewels . maria lark bridget often my entire family stitches her offbeat humor like shouting her mom who wakes screaming bad dream , " mom , please stop doing ! " sofia vassilieva older aerial keeps arguments breakfast table bouncing . david cubitt who plays reoccurring role detective lee scanlon also achieves amazing chemistry arquette . miguel sandoval district attorney manuel duvalos such focused calmness he centers crime portion show . ( perhaps we sometime see more his family . ) while it hard pick my favorite first season episode , complex plot " priest , doctor medium walk into execution chamber " jewel , police chasing ghost who apparently just committed murder . dvd commentaries introduction real-life alison dubois really give excellent background fans show . this one show reaches level art me . its excellence make it memorable long time this dvd collection valuable addition entertainment collection . bravo	1

many ways , ridley scott films remind me brian de palma's: many people consider him filmmaking icon , notable director among many many other ones making good or bad films . sure de palma his scarface his untouchables but don't forget he also forgettable snake eyes mission mars . ridley scott meanwhile alien gladiator(overrated personally ) but he white squall 1692 but chalk blade runner up his more memorable films its probably one better made sci-fi films 80 . it 2017 mankind developed replicants , humanoids who look very similar humans used degrading work . after they decide revolt , humans start making specialists - blade runners - " retire " replicants , other words , kill . they bring deckard , retired blade runner , track down replicants who recently escaped all while falling love one . lot futuristic films seem very ambitious where technology reaches point where anything possible . interstellar travel , flying cars , sophisticated id systems holographs very present these kind films but oddly , blade runner doesn't much . while it some scenes involving flying cars going over neon-lit cities woman face building , when we're ground level technology isn't apparent . it helps film feel real plausible without looking too ambitious its own good . it interesting note although film considered sci-fi film , it kind light action scenes . it not big deal but when you look main cover art , deckard gun hand , but people thinking this going slam-bang action film ridley scott might disappointed . i surely expecting it but seeing film , good it , i like " wow , not lot fast parts " . then again , alien deliberate pacing so i guess it expected . those you wondering , this isn't super deluxe edition where we different versions film(that 2007 ) , so this one we only get remastered version film better transfer . so if you want replace your crappy original director cut version horrible main menu crappy transfer , go ahead but if you want more bang your 30 40$ whatever it come up , wait till 2007	1
if you relatively good or even average shape looking really tone up sculpt your body , this isn't workout you . it didn't get my heart rate up i didn't break sweat . instructor spent too much time exercises explain what next , too much down time . i actually got bored . sculpting stick not needed , ' fanny lifer ' used just sit much time when exercises could modified standing or kneeling . i am extremely disappointed . i wasn't sore or challenged . this might good workout someone who extremely overweight needs go slower pace , but anyone looking drop 5-20 lbs or firm up this isn't you !	-1
i like this new mature van damme . first hell now wake death they're best films his career he actually starting show some genuine acting talent . i hope this trend continues . wife/family murdered son kidnapped van damme ( or v.d. i like call him ) out revenge . he shoots up bunch stuff , runs drill through guy kneecaps , wrecks some cars , cries few times , drives motorcycle through mall , hugs some people , electrocutes cop shoots triad who tied up point blank face shotgun . honestly i liked this movie quite bit , ending little anti-climatic , but cinematography cool . i'd watch it again which more than i could say double team .	-1

clueless thoroughly delightful film , this edition improves it excellent bonus features - all good , but fashion 101 not missed . despite its glossy veneer - world populated attractive , narcissistic , privileged kids - clueless smart , droll , endearing look inside youth culture . because it touches universal themes , fully operational when jane austen wrote emma , film withstands test time despite language ( if ) fashion trends ( droopy drawers skaters ) , fads , average life span drosophila . many viewers approach clueless certain amount hostility . cher , protagonist , played perfection alicia silverstone , impossibly beautiful . worse still , her father , gruff but charmingly protective dan hedaya , beyond rich . even worse , cher seems live entirely surface things , expressing her creativity through social meddling wardrobe . ( outfits worn cher , her friend dionne , others their inner circle reason enough watch film . ) how could we ever like such wretched , spoiled kids ? because , clueless beautifully executed , gentle satire , not broad farce or biting indictment . writer/director amy heckerling , ( who also fast times ridgemont high - lesser endeavor ) , understands loves her characters , they not stereotypes . we like these kids because they joke , they know they're hothouse orchids . blatant examples include murray , played donald faison ( now scrubs ) black uber-yuppie who learns his street patois mtv , jeremy sisto elton who apparently hobbled his identity together rat pack press photos . stage beautifully set , comedy manners begins , cher manipulates people order serve her idea greater social good learns few lessons way . no one shot . no helicopters appear . inept driving featured , but there no car chases . wonder wonders , especially teen movie , there no gratuitous sex . amy heckerling saluted creating film relies story , dialogue , detail , character , acting work . her success complete . clueless uses socal youth culture its milieu , not its point . really pleasure worth owning	1
awesome movies , but way too expensive product itself . first , i bought it reduced priced , since it left sitting shelve collecting dust few years store . they dropped price initial $200 ( around $150 u . . ) , $149 ( around $110 u . . ) , cheapest price i could find it my city far . few stores told me their cost around $149 , so it able buy it around cost . considering , it bargain , so i got lucky start . now movies , they awesome , after watching them all two days , i felt sad , sad hollywood current level movie making , after tasting piece history , movies deep , funny , either deals issues ( seven samurai hidden fortress ) or don't ( yojimbo sanjuro ) , they all movie gems . but we also realistic here , seven samurai my opinion real champion this set , it everything , it epic , yet personal , it deep , yet sometime funny , but always powerful superb . now quality disk , where it hard tell , these old movies . but something struck me odd , seven samurai ( 7s ) , around 10 yrs before yojimbo sanjuro but looks sound better , obviously , they cleaned it out little before putting it dvd , but then , if yojimbo sanjuro where made 10 yrs later , someone should expect least equal quality , if not better then 7s , but it not case , especially yojimbo painful watch , sound track loud background hiss least half movie , scratches big straw last full min multiple times , contrast brightness out wack half scenes , it painful experience , you tell yourself how great movie , but it ever ugly watch . so far i would give it 4 stars , why then i give it 2 ? it down price vs quality extras . no extras what so ever beside theater trailer each movie , commentary track 7s , then nothing . so criterion my mind two choice , drop price 1/3 1/2 what it now , or pick better original copy bring dvd , clean it , add extras , selling it same price it now , but they neither . they used yojimbo , terribly copy , add nothing , charge full criterion price , bad !!! so end , one fell like robbed ronins . my case , i wanted see those movies , own 7s this box set only way go doing this , end , i praise movie , acting , story , camera work , everything , except criterion dvd who brought those movies it north america , they dropped ball this one . so 0 stars criterion there dvd product ( this case ) 4 stars movie themselves so my end review 2 stars	-1
my daughters ( 14 10 time this review ) i make habit " gilmore-ing " ( ) regular basis . we buy snacks , watch most season day , talk show all way through . we relate characters personal level , yet without charm stars hollow nestle into end day unfortunately . thing , gilmore girls smart show . it throws out references so fast watching it feels energizing rather than draining . fashion year or two ahead usually , which fun . plus ,. this age clearchannel radio , it great hear lesser-known bands featured regular basis . we definitely huge fans gilmore girls , but would i enjoy it much if i not daughters ? i'm not sure . i enjoy show doesn't wrap things up neatly most time , show doesn't develop around characters who fit into " acceptable role model " slot . these characters good people who screw up they living their daily lives . they keep going , keep connecting world around them , keep loving each other . it one those shows certain parents wouldn't trust their kids able interpret . watching show single mother who makes something herself spite teenage pregnancy isn't going say " this good idea . " what it says life messy , thing keep moving ahead much grace vision possible .	1
this one those movies they felt dressed up bit order dumb movie audience give it chance . or so this how they film studios see it anyway . this certainly message movie , its not so sutble message anti-thatcherism hits you head like brick ! americans ignorant britain today might hard time following it . however , if one disregards rather dated politics here , theme movie seen universal one long-time workers now frequently victims changing economics . more than anything else this movie music brass bands . opening march . . hall " death or glory " says it all ! players this band their fight mine death or glory proposition . incidently hall little known new england composer marches , its interesting his music should make it back acorss pond english brass bands . my personal tastes runs military bands which instrumentation richer more varied . brass bands don't any woodwinds ! softer tone they produce more mellow sound , compared richer , stirring military band . its nice see working class mines england produced these high quality bands . no comparison fond here states mine workers . you would sooner find most us blue collar workers topless bars after their shift rather than going band practice ! so these bands part england cultural scene , popular band music they played often bridge common man classical concert hall out-door band concert . their loss would certainly sad . band portrayed here film actual famous brass band , it would interesting know if it really disbanded because yorkshire mine closings . actors fine job . pete postlewaite wonderful . anything he seems golden . tara fitsgerald very appealing seductive . shes also wonderful see almost anything . plot its usual twists turns keeps interest . human dramas behind music what most compelling this film . movie should made many fine regimental bands disbanded british army recent years . like civilian band portrayed here , many these bands histories went back centuries , their loss regiments which them keen . many fine musicians them also forced into redundancy or seek non-musical employment army . certainly what blair here every bit bad what thatcher mines . destruction these many fine military bands loss communities well morale their regiments . loss any band cultural loss , whether civilian or military . young listeners today increasingly no exposure music other than dreadful pop , loss such bands truly dire situation . these musical entities their free open air concerts vital link people hear different kinds music . i can't imagine what music tastes people future . sure it won't good . this deffinitely fine movie , good plot , strong acting , some wonderful brass music . if viewers become inspired listen this kind music result this film then all should not vain . strongly recommeded despite silly box cover	1

this review contains spoilers . i wasn't aware this movie when it released heard it only recently because i got know like work actress lindsay crouse " buffy vampire slayer " " hack . " movie got high marks imdb crowd amazon.com, but i've burned way many times so expected disappointed " house games , " too . i pleasantly surprised find movie far above average . i'd put it top 10 percent all movies i've seen . i'm so glad david mamet decided make this movie his wife lead his friend joe montegna playing mike . both actors perfectly cas t.t hat said , i three minor quibbles movie . ( spoilers coming . ) first , it seemed obvious me lindsay character conned when briefcase containing $ 80,000 went missing lindsay offered reimburse con men . concomitantly , it didn't make sense lindsay character wouldn't catch point she conned . later movie , lindsay visits bar where con men hang out . she enters late night through back door , which all too conveniently unlocked . lastly , when lindsay joe their final confrontation they baggage handling area large airport . no one else around . not even close enough , apparently , hear six gunshots . but these small complaints compared overall quality movie . " house games " gem	-1
wondefull !!!!!!!!!!!! if you love tap dancing , love stories , past present tap dancers this movie you . although dancing takes place , this not " musical " or something " broadway " . this movie storyline highly recommended !	1
yes . wild things what i recommend our jaded eyes . aren't we sick all crowd pleasing pg-13 shows which neither sexy or action packed - most all hardly plot ? wild things sex sex sex but witty capital humor twisted story . recent eye candy shows could learn thing or two this film . candy remain sweet sickening but great script good cast ( oscar nominee matt dillon , kevin bacon etc ) turn candy into cuisine	-1
well i must say i really enjoyed this movie , i saw it awhile back tv i said next time it hit dvd i buy it . i like all roles women played . each person character or situation i relate little . we all tried give man ours chance or try there him , but it turns out they not appreciate us all . they took our niceness weakness but sooner or later its time pay back .. lol not abuse or burning down house but get them back away they not even see it coming . this movies funny , sad , joyful . i reccommend everyone see this dv	1
plot : there string unsolved murders harrison penitentiary . detective louis burke ( jean-claude van damme ) sent undercover inmate investigate . help his assigned " wife " ( charatcer amanda beckett , played cynthia gibb ) , he manages uncover few dirty secrets place . once he truly gets into heat situation , he discovers guards prison officials themselves might even involved . whole scheme starting make sense , doesn't stay good thing long . his presence prison becoming too much danger conspirors , he becomes next hitlist . but burke isn't going down easy . least that what we think , until old enemy -- christian " sandman " naylor ( patrick kilpatrick ) -- transferred prison finish him off good . fight solve murder mystery over , yet fight burkes life only beginning . death warrant action flick . period . although story interesting follow , true reason anyone would watch this would down'n'dirty mayhem van damme his usual kick-butt mode . prison conspiracy not huge government cover up , but rather small ring corruption hidden higher officials . so instead thriller bunch different suspicious characters involved , we've got van damme stuck all alone deadly prison without prayer ! that where action comes . this isn't kind " blow stuff up " or " shoot em down " popcorn movie , this hand-to-hand combat girtty intensity . best example would grand finale : final fight sandman burke ( definitely my favorite part ) . that where anything goes , barbaric brawling death only way out . note , i particularly fond patrick kilpatrick sandman . he often seen villain-type roles , but this just hits nail head . only slight complaint i ( reason it only hits four stars ) sandman doesn't enough screen time . i don't want spoil storyline , but you assume because his late arrival film , he not mystery murderer . he more like executioner sent burke . parts he get last half film -- well first scene which we see encounter naylor burke when naylor free man -- satisfying , but let face it , he one hell villain he needed more show . regardless , death warrant just what you need if you like simple yet engaging fight flick . although only special feature theatrical trailer , only reason you need purchase this dvd film itself . it quite impressive , leaves you some fond memories both van damme kilpatrick . pick it up !	-1

this rare tv concert great collector piece . video quality good best , although " advertising hype " insists it beautiful . it film transfer cleaned beautifully [ de-speckled ] , but expense crispness . i find some additional " bonus " material boring . still it definite " keeper . " extra footage deleted section [ mein herr ] treat watch apparently not " cleaned , " maybe purpose , so we see what original aging film looked like before restoration , which i heard took on-and-off ... six years complete . ae segment puts me sleep , glaad awards stuff so-so , but liza john kander chatting piece interesting . cd , " liza , " accompanies dvd this edition . i not listened it yet but when i ... it nice hear it without all those ticks pops [ my vinyl record 30 years ago ]	-1

" fort apache " , henry fonda , new commander , fort apache , arrogant indian hating , irish-catholic disliking , wasp who seeks glory himself , no matter what cost maybe ! great perfomances fonda , wayne , george o'brien , ward bond , anna lee , irene rich , victor mclaglen , dick foran(who sings very well too ) , grant withers(as corrupt suttler ) , guy kibbe , pedro armendariz , very sympathetic " cochise " miguel inclan ! shirley temple john agar provide love interest . great movie ! great western !! america greatest director !!	1
if you considering buying this film , may i recommend you save tons money buying it bible collection box set , which contains 6 these bible movies , abraham , jacob , joseph , moses , samson delilah , david ! production values very high all six films , you pay half off cost buying each one separately ! david one best dvds this series bible movies , made mid 1990s . it covers most big scenes his life , it very well cast acted all . first hour shows young david anointed , then persecuted years under jealous king saul . second hour covers david his peak , king israel . third hour shows david sin punishment over his adultery bathsheba , god punishment using his rebellious son absalom . this all very gripping enjoyable drama , especially any bible students who enjoy seeing so many bible scenes not often portrayed other films . they cover lot scripture , without unlimited budget , so sometimes they alter some details stories . instance , famous david versus goliath battle not take place front philistine israeli armies , scripture , but rather isolation . it budgetary rewrite , but dramatic impact tension still present . filmmakers ' intentions honorable , though their budget may not ambitious enough portray some larger , more expensive scenes out scripture . if they cut some corners due budget , they more than make up it quantity quality scriptural scenes they show . one best sections dvd david adulterous relationship bathsheba , then his scheming against uriah , her husband . scenes absalom trying overthrow his father very well made , very scriptural , well . actor playing adult david brilliant performance , portraying many decades life david . leonard nimoy ( mr. spock star trek fame ) good samuel , ( though richard gere film king david definitive , ultimate onscreen chemistry samuel king saul ) . actors king saul bathsheba both very good this dvd version david . you also find three other great movies this series movies . look bible series box set featuring esther , jeremiah solomon , too . these also your best buy box set , rather than separately ! these 9 bible movies , three 90 minutes long , jacob . esther , jeremiah . other 6 around 3 hours long . i think longer ones originally aired tv mini series , over multiple nights . all these films , my one criticism might they bit weak showing some supernatural events scripture . this seems due expense special effectts , perhaps , my guess . but most part , all 9 dvds great very good actors portraying tension drama these classic bible stories , they consistently good faithful gist spirit bible stories they tell . i think these 9 dvds best series bible dvds available anywhere ! there better , single movies dvd , but group , whole , there not bigger , better dvd set available anywhere , i know . these box sets perfect basis any personal or church library bible movies . they virtually all so close scripture you forced compare films actual bible hand , verify whether or not scene accurate scripture or not . very good bible learning exercise , it shows high value quality owning these dvds . all 9 these bible dvds worth buying owning any christian personal dvd library , most frugally purchased via two different box sets ! highly recommended	1

original batman animated series remains best representation caped crusader film . viewers familiar current ' batman ' series - pale imitation - who not aware earlier better effort missing one great entertainment experiences - not only kids , but adults like myself , who grew up comic book . it shame word warner bros . thinking cancelling their other stellar achievement , justice league unlimited series , they taken such long time produce box set its earlier manifestaion , glorious justice league . one hopes if enough dedicated viewers make noise , something might this . providing hours intelligent fun , watching these shows my children irreplacable bonding experience	1

fuss over forrest gump still amazes me . this movie basically rips off better movies almost every scene . still somehow it managed win best picture over pulp fiction shawshank redemption 1994 . out all movies released 1n 94 this one wouldnt even make my top 20 . nobodys fool , quiz show , lion king , list goes . only reason i would give it props for(at time ) special effects , which now dated . after gump zemekis directed episode tales crypt where he used same technology easiest worst episode year . i used huge zemekis fan . used cars , romancing stone , back furture movies death becomes her i thought strong movies . but arounf back future 2 i thought zemekis started rely much special effects it shows this film . objective viewer re-watch this film think every scene try remember where you seen scene before . i guarantee you after you you see this movie totally different light	-1

not following recent broadway scene very much , i wasn't really aware what sensation " rent " several years ago when it debuted . i became more aware it when it satirized southpark picture " team america " after my church intergenerational choir sang show " theme " song " seasons love " . then one kids i worked local musical said rent one his favorites , so i first-weekend attendee theatre . story important it depicts gays , lesbians , drag queens drug addicts real people struggling life , love ( aids ) just like so-called " normal " people . rock style , songs aren't necessarily " toe-tappers " you end up whistling way out theatre ( though " seasons love " comes close , particularly if you've sang it least two dozen times , " la vie boheme " showstopper -- plot supposedly based opera name ) , but overall music very exciting integral story . cast moved almost en masse broadway hollywood -- wilson heredia , tony winner drag queen angel , should contended oscar supporting actor . i've read there some concern mainstream hollywood director chris columbus ( home alone , harry potter i ii ) getting job , but i don't see picture suffered it -- maybe some unconvincing special effects worst it . rock opera , it takes some time get used almost all dialogue sung rather than spoken . overall solid four star film ---- definitely recommended fans modern musicals , those marginalized communities , those art their soul s.p.s. afterwards i got hooked soundtrack cd few weeks ( months ? ) but that review	-1

" shaun " supposed comedic ' spoof ' ' homage ' " zombie movie " . it accomplished more . while comedy wryly british , it still funny - social comment universal civilized society ( cased you missed it - we're all zombies already ) . just fun movie , start finish - warned there gratuitous ' gore ' scenes necessary it zombie film , but they few , fast over . there lot ' quick-wit ' humor - newscaster comments end , " i never thought i'd say ... " example . strip away humor homage , there actually much tighter plot than many movies . there not many loose threads - " how zombie get ? " - go back three scenes oh , ed habitually leaves front door open ... impressed attention those kind details . it billed " romantic comedy zombies " - it delivers .	-1

everyone thinks this movie anthony hopkins living out some demented " gorillas mist " nightmare . simply catalyst teaching us something how we relate world around us . everything this movie control , desire control those who not like us , desire guards control population , desire gooding character contol hopkins . but , what hopkins teach us we not control , but we simply hold onto our illusions control . when our illusions threatened we become angry frightened because we afraid reality . ever wonder why we so disturbed home invasion ? it because someone came , or because we built up illusion we safe , now illusion gone ? this movie look past gorillas corny guards predictable plot , look deeper into what characters reveal ourselves . truly , then this very frightening movie	1
house perfect marriage great character brilliant actor -i can't imagine anyone else role but hugh laurie , he nothing short spectacular . he not only play comedy , but drama , while speaking accent that vastly different his own , while reciting complex medical terminology , while walking limp , cane . they should just hand him best actor emmy every year , because no one else even come close what this man brings every episode . i late party , not finding house until middle season two , but i more than made up it . i never bought any television series dvd before this . i both seasons dvd watched episodes over over again . i watch least one episode every day or i start withdrawal symptoms . great storylines superb cast make this must see show . all i say hugh da man	1

i seen almost all anime offer , but this best . yoko kano , music directer , one , if not , best world . plot gets very depth . you get know all charecters such kiba , toboe , tsume , hige , blue , cheza , all great depth . no matter how many times i see it , it doesn't get old . but after you see end series you never look charecters same way . series takes place apacaliptic age , all world turmoil . only wolves find paradise , rakuen . wolves create illusion human figure protect their identity , but some people see through disguise such nobles . thats where it all starts . actual animation best , detail background folds cloths , it well drawn boot . this anime anyone , men , women , teenagers , pets , anyone over thirteen . this my utmost recamendation all anime . i recomend seeing it japanese	1

ok ... 200 reviews this movie . yeah .. tarantino good ; elmore leonard great . but jackie brown stolen . it belongs grier forrestor . i no doubt tarantino excellent job directing . but this not his film it not follow up pulp fiction ! grier jackie brown her thing ... tarantino nor s.l. jackson steal her fire . jackie like screen burn . this her movie ... then surprisingly , out nowhere comes forrestor max cherry , hard-boiled but bald spot no hipster quality whatsover . this contrasts well s.l. jackson almost freaky soul brutha halloween costume . max tough , dealing bail jumpers . but he looks like regular shmo , quality enforced immediately when he meets jackie , who , you see , not looking her best . jackie stands out one most dynamic characters i've seen movie , it shame she got no props it . she switches polite tough , desperate determined , white-polite jive-alive , serious seductive ; all this bat eyelash . she cool cool -- booyah ! -- sexy sexy . halle berry go swing monkey bars . most us youngsters not seen this actress . no this not remind me foxie brown . it reminds me more reaction rita hayworth gets shawshank redemption when she appears flips up her hair . everyone cheers . music -- i think tarantino deserves cred here -- adds quite bit emotion characters . this movie , you get course soul 101 but also how music create mood let actor play off it . good summary this chemical reaction how it hits max while driving back work . he pops tape delphonics , somewhat obscure philly soul band . his excitement mirrors ours . earlier , he watched jackie light smoke play lp same band after stint prison . she sways relief , not overtly seductive , but enthusiasm seems missing cherry many our lives . i hate call this film underrated because then it puts it competition tarantino movies i suppose leonard adaptations . we should look it through different lens . which leads me spoiler ....... below ----- i want give respect tarantino or pam forrestor or whoever last scene which max jackie kiss . normally -- thank you hollywood -- black woman kissing white man intimately would awkward . passionate , crazy ok . but intimate no . gotta go out date end movie . kissing scene end completely natural says something . what it say ? i suppose , me part interracial couple , it shows we aren't used seeing this screen . or else director , actor , actress damn good ? i dunno ! gabriel elias	1
first i wondered this particular pairing bert i . gordon classics but when i realized both movies involve giant menaces eliminated same way it became clear . first we earth vs . spider ( often listed tv spider ) . here small town witnesses battles giant spider lives nearby cave . it take while town realize what going first witnesses kids . but soon hunt town mobilizes eliminate giant arachnid . no explanation ever given during movie creature great size . i often wonder if there tentative plans sequel . whatever case , this wonder film giant menaces . unlike similar films , there no delay seeing monster it gets plenty screen time . war colossal beast second feature sequel amazing colossal man . colossal man though perished when he fell huge dam end first movie . but here we quickly discover he alive if not well preying upon food trucks sustenance . he eventually captured folks first film try communicate him bring him back sanity . but giant disfigured man beyond hope or he redeemed scientists or love his sister ? only watching film answer questions . there one odd bit where film suddenly goes black white color right near end . while i would liked double feature two colossal man films two selected this disk go well together . disk lack anything ib way special features but separate menus each film . both films one side disk so there no need flip it over . if you like classic giant menace movies then this definitely one watch	-1
here we what one most mind bogglingly boring movies ever made ! i couldn't believe what i watching ! moreover , i am aghast this film garnered some acclaim some reviewers these pages even saw fit award this dreck unbelievable four five star rating . what going ? it me or them totally lost plot what movies supposed all ? am i naive think movies should first foremost entertain ? where oh where entertainment this lame effort film its unsteady shaky comera work , hamfisted confusing screenplay cloying performance modern cinema most tedious overratedsleep inducing actor ralph fiennes ? how i long good old days when we great movies great actors great writers great directors which achieved what they set out - entertain . sadly emergence such travesty " constant gardener " it appears we unfortunate " real " film lovers dismal viewing future .	-1

i'm glad i didn't let any negative review sway me getting this disc . while ae biography " feel good " story this legend , this disc much more honest it portrayal johhny . they don't hide fact he two sides , w.c. holland , brother tommy cash recall great detail what fully human man black really . narrator fine , re-enactments minimal , needed tell types true stories these wild boys went through . it doesn't take anything away story . disc doesn't focus his music so much ( there no full songs presented ) , man he . that ok ; i enough john music compensate . i love guy even more now then before . no sugar coating ; just like johnny would've wanted it .	1
great movie , great actors such sad part u.s. history ! it great see this movie some men who really existed ( especially " stonewall " jackson ) . we don't know if personalities showed into movie really like this or if it pure fiction , but end day it not very important , because historical interest preserved	1
wands ready ! daniel radcliffe takes up role mysterious boy wizard harry potter j.k. rowling epic seven part fantasy series . fans all ages going crazy ever since they heard rowling popular series going transfigured , so speak , into film showed movie screens around world . yet what makes this movie so unique it not derived modern video game or television series , younger generation seems enjoy , but ancient form entertainment . book ! just what magic held within those pages , seemed hooked readers into its compelling storyline around world ? harry potter sorcerer stone filled plenty excitement . screenplay wonderfully interpreted rowling complex storyline introduces harry potter realm ; actors actresses portray believable , memorable characters , every scene filled spectacular special effects . i find it only fair this movie truly piece magic itself . harry potter sorcerer stone first compelling seven-story adventure where one night living his aunt uncle somewhat abused life , eleven-year-old harry potter ( daniel radcliffe ) learns he wizard gets shipped off hogwarts school witchcraft wizardry learn art magic . his arrival he befriends ron weasley ( rupert grint ) insufferable know it all hermione granger ( emma watson ) , course there deadly enemy main character always makes , draco malfoy ( tom felton ) . harry potter brought many trials cloisters learning art magic his many teachers like professor mcgonagall ( maggie smith ) " greasy git " professor snape ( alan rickman ) , all while praised highly greatest wizard world , albus dumbledore ( richard harris ) taken under large wing half-giant gamekeeper rubeus hagrid ( robbie coltrane ) . what makes this story more compelling harry potter himself hero , hero defeating dark wizard name lord voldemort ( craftily computer generation ) . now lord voldemort after precious stone make him immortal , harry his friends only ones who stop him . harry potter sorcerers stone , filled action packed scenes digitally enhanced wonders technology three-headed dog miniature dragon . some best scenes include quidditch scene where harry partakes his first quidditch match , devil snare scene where harry , ron hermione find themselves choked plant , finally troll scene where harry ron save hermione ghastly looking , mold covered troll . these digital enhancements polish gems movie perfectly make them shine outstanding brightness , they really give movie magical aspect . setting also strong point found within movie . most places match ones described book perfectly . they create such vivid image mind , it almost makes you think it what you seeing real . hogwarts castle depicted almost perfectly it towering roofs warmly lit windows . corridors lit torches floating candles while potions classroom looks dark grimy . grounds beautiful , flourishing spring magic . every aspect craftily make movie real book possible . movie also some shortcomings well . it two half hours long , you figure they'd put important parts . however , this not case . most time , important parts lead next event cut out rearranged make story better movie audience . other aspects film , harry portrayed unrealistically boy wizard who defeated dark lord age six months now greatest wizard all time ? moment harry enters hogwarts he becomes hero even though he didn't anything . most harry life he didn't even know his great feat against dark lord , within days hogwarts he flaunting his unique lightning bolt scar like he knew one day he would become hero . he then takes responsibility saving entire school dark powers without question . i'd expect eleven-year-old boy would scared just like every other young kid who threatened death . harry potter , all glory it received , some competition . i firmly believe harry potter sorcerers stone fell directly fans tolkien lord rings c.s. lewis ' chronicles narnia , both which came out their own movie . firm christians sought out narnia , while hardcore fantasy fans fled lord rings , leaving harry potter middle . however there some hardcore harry potter fans well , but when rowling epic story ends , this brilliant story just fade or fall into shadows films become classics . even though movie both very strong points it shortcomings , it still overall great film . first epic seven part series , this movie ends happy ending , but lot questions unanswered . there both good bad side this . many fans can't stand waiting next film produced year or so , but if you get them hooked enough , you guarantee they'll back next one . harry potter sorcerer stone movie made family viewing . it depicts life wizard how he copes new world . it also firmly implies important lessons courage loyalty those you care . now , there total six books four harry potter movies , all which hit record amounts . fans j.k. rowling masterpiece anxiously awaiting closure her series final book . i suggest until happens , fans occupy themselves watching magic harry potter films majestic moral themes they present . this reveiw katelynn mallonrabbid harry potter fangir	1

this definitely b-movie , so don't expect great acting or special effects , but boy , it hunky guys showing off their glistening bodies much possible . imagine movie starring bunch abercrombie fitch models ... imagine acting caliber said models . only thing really bothered me ridiculous annoying " special effect " used whenever leeches attacked someone . but , now it available really low price , it even more worth it if you like campy , brainless fun . this one those flix you would rate " 1 star " if your reference point normal hollywood blockbuster , but genre it , this definitely great addition	-1
i'm average shape frequently exercise home . i used minna fat eliminator workout while enjoyed her style , so i decided give " emergency " workout shot . i just got it this week entire video twice . 30-minute toning portion great . she combines arms legs so you work up sweat . she very thorough , covering all arm muscles fatiguing legs well . i wish she spent little more time abs , but that my only complaint . 30-minute cardio routine fun , but it take few times get moves down , including mambos , cha chas , hip shakes , other salsa-type moves . it requires some concentration which fine me , because it makes workout go quicker . i haven't sweated much i fat eliminator workout , but i attest fact i'm still getting used moves . once i become more familiar routine , i'm hoping increase my own intensity work up better sweat . overall , this fun cardio toning program . i highly recommend anyone who looking " dancey " workout .	-1

i saw " annie get your gun " again this weekend live stage . i forgotten just how many great songs irving berlin wrote this masterpiece ! --" you can't get man gun " , " girl i marry " , " doin ' what comes naturally , " " anything you i better , " " they say falling love wonderful , " " i got sun morning moon night , " classic anthem " there no business like show business . " if you haven't seen or heard this musical , please yourself favor get this film tape or dvd . afterthoughts : i just read several negative reviews betty hutton portrayal annie oakley . not believe them . not even read them ! some people " glass half empty " type people negativity contagious ! betty hutton portrayal , course , probably directed director film . so it " director portrayal " ; director responsible what betty hutton screen . , this not meant " realistic " portrayal " real " person anyway --- no one alive remembers what annie oakley really like . so portrayal betty hutton ( directed her director ) good " shot it " any other --- including judy garland portrayal . so , i suggest you just accept betty huttons portrayal " one among many possible " enjoy what portrayal --- alot comedic verve vivacity ! yes , " glass half full " .. even more than half .... this case . then there some reviewers who criticize show because annie pretends poorer shot than frank near end " get her man " letting him win thus showing his " shooting prowess " some respect make him feel better . i suppose some people it " politically incorrect " " play male ego game " . but , isn't " playing male ego game " what it takes sometimes " get man you want ? " so , wasn't annie play just " realistic " ? isn't criticizing this aspect play " nit-picking " . ask yourself , could you even come close writing " masterpiece " like musical , " annie get your gun " ? if you couldn't it , then what gives you right " nit pic " show ? indian issue . some people feel indians disrespected show . but , show i saw chief sitting bull portrayed giving good advice annie intelligent person . my opinion , whichever way indians portrayed movie doesn't change anything all positive aspects show . my suggestion forget all nit-picking enjoy show ! there alot enjoy ! :o ) email boland7214 @aol .	1

i saw this recently lark just see what all brigitte bardot fuss -- wasn't expecting much since sex comedy farces ( particularly french ones ) aren't high my film watch lists -- but surprised how good ( good-natured ) it . besides vivacious charms ms. bardot , this film solid script good acting dialogs . ( one my favorite lines bardot replying query why family won't sell its puny shipyard effect they want least still * own * something not feel poor . ) story not highbrow , but far lowbrow tawdry exploitative some newcomers ( like me ) might perceive its notorious reputation . bardot plays juliette , " town tramp " st. tropez who pursued rich , elderly playboy while carrying torch antonio , impecunious shipwright who treats her just convenient one-night-stand . comes antonio younger brother , michele , who truly loves her offers marry her save her sent back orphanage . juliette marries michele comes love him despite herself , while fighting against her reckless , impetuous nature antonio comes back into scene presents constant temptation . love or lust wins out ? call me old-fashioned , but i liked how movie ends , i agree amazon reviewer analysis ( robert cartland ) , which hits it square head . ( btw , video transfer this criterion dvd edition excellent , eliminating all old flaws while preserving warm , vibrant colors st. tropez location great effect . )	-1

i thought i taking risk buying this dvd because there not much info it . after watching full dvd , i'm glad i took risk . this dvd pleasant surprise ! well worth money i spent . dvd split into 3 main sections : tools techniques , then artistic principles , last one complete animation example start finish . first 2 sections 1 1/2 hours each while last one hour . watching tools techniques section , i little worried because dvd uses animation master i use maya . i thought it would hard follow , but i glad know tools animation master pretty much same maya . they similar bones , ik , fk , dope sheet , graph editor . way he teaches tools more like how use tools , not which button push menu . example he showed how use dope sheet graph editor correctly structured way so your animations easy change if need . after watching this , i liked he taught it this way instead " click here here " , because you really get sense how why certain things animation . there lots small examples spread out through first part . now this where i found dvd most helpful . i read lots books animation , but never really ' got it ' just reading . seeing examples full motion really helps out lot . second section all animation art . he talked principles like squash stretch , weight , staging , keyframing , secondary action . too many list right now . each little chapter lots examples showing you how animate principle correctly . i loved fact he showed lots common mistakes then how fix them . this section really where you learn how make your animations look good it pretty entertaining . oh yeah , entertainment factor also big plus . i watched through this 4 hr dvd one sitting , which no small feat ! they used lots different footage their examples , which i thought keeps it fresh active . i've seen other 3d training videos just computer screen guy talking , that all you see . if you think sounds boring , well it . this dvd different they teacher basically talking audience then they would cut animation examples or computer screen further illustrate what teacher saying . music cool too . one thing bug me little sound . background hiss pretty high , which annoying , but you could still easily hear everything clearly . it just wasn't dvd quality audio though . last section dvd full animation example concept finally rendering . i enjoyed this part lot , because i got see how professional animator animates . he not only tells you what he doing , but also his mental critiques animation also what he planning next . when mistakes happens , he told you how fix them . if everything before this section theory , then this section practical . all all , great dvd learn . i know i re-watching this one few times	1
mamoru oshii outstanding ghost shell ( 1995 ) , director/writer gave himself little time , less than 90 minutes , explore many questions he raised script . his long-awaited sequel , ghost shell 2 : innocence , he succeeds answering many these questions whilst same time giving us many more ponder , film , though flawed , deserves 5 star rating . rather like disney animation , film viewed more than one level more than one audience . surface it sumptuously-animated film which fairly conventional who-done-it plot unfolds ; robots murdering humans , crime specialist brought solve case . period . we already seen equivalent plots films such blade runner or i , robot this film nothing new add basic idea . however oshii world far more disturbing complex below surface . he subverts ending film which , could taken triumph good over evil . however , when distinctions robot human become blurred central notions good evil film fall down . he pulls other tricks undermine our assumptions humanity ; one point main cop character puts coat over robot hide its nakedness ; time robotic character philosophises over meaning existence , whilst chain-smoking . it director treatment paradox what it means human film value lies , not superficial plot . characterisation little scimpy ( notable exception depiction oshii own basset hound , which drawn clear devotion ) but visually film stunning . oshii one few directors able practice delicate art inactivity screen . he not scared abandon plot minutes end luxuriate , example , extended arial shot city , or dwell completely motionless face whilst we register its owner emotional state , or allow his main characters , motionless screen what seems like ages , quote western philosophical religious texts . none these scenes moves plot forwards yet film would immeasurably poorer without them . too many sequels outstanding films try provide glib answers issues raised original most fail this approach ; examples such 2010 matrix reloaded spring mind . this film oshii avoided this pitfall given us rare sequal , takes theme original finds something fresh say . summary , film deserves 5 star rating , but i think it falls short greatness .	1

glory truly extraordinary motion picture all sorts ways . proud southerner , i say no other film ever me cheering union regiment taking company confederate soldiers . i little worried this film would demonize south , but it proved most even-handed treatment all parties . demonstrating racism northerners - soldiers civilians alike - it paints most nuanced portrait african-american men who seized opportunity don blue uniforms fight country many them must unable truly call their own . only makes their heroism bravery all more poignant . war states never understood simple black white terms any level , many union soldier clearly wasn't fighting emancipate slaves ( just many rebel soldier wasn't fighting slavery ) . even when they actually used teach actual history schools , story 54th massachusetts regiment subject never really came up - what gives glory such extraordinary amount historical importance . i wouldn't go so far say heroism sacrifice this first african-american regiment union army turned tide war , but it lead acceptance actual black fighting soldiers union ranks - 210,000 such recruits certainly proved important fighting force basically won through strength numbers ( more blues than grays died war ) . movie itself , though , really men who led made up 54th massachusetts regiment - there sterling performances all over place . i said many times past , morgan freeman best actor living today , his character , sgt . major john rawlins , really heart soul whole film . older , runaway slave , he gained measure wisdom restraint private trip ( denzel washington ) never even imagined . trip wears scars his back proudly , he not stand down before any man . washington earned best supporting actor award his role , rightly so . educated freemen represented thomas searles ( andre braugher ) , who seems ill-suited harsh realities war but shoulders burden pride determination . head these men rides colonel robert gould shaw ( matthew broderick ) , young officer who secured position more family influence than merit , perhaps , but he more than rises challenge fight both his men . despite his lifelong friendship thomas , he almost no connection men 54th must learn know them earn their respect . union army doesn't even want supply his men necessities such decent shoes uniform , nor it really any intention actually sending them into combat . thanks colonel , though , fighting men 54th eventually get their chance prove themselves leading what basically suicidal charge against fort wagner south carolina . aside multi-layered story itself , one must impressed realism action . war ugly business , fact brought home very first scenes showing colonel shaw charge during battle antietam . while there should small rivers blood covering battlefield , watching soldier head basically explode makes vivid stamp realism . while i would question tactics employed assault fort wayne end , movie certainly capture nature fog war viciousness hand-to-hand fighting heroes both sides . course , this movie , so there numerous historical inaccuracies main characters ( none whom , other than col . shaw , based actual soldiers ) battles , yet glory certainly succeed telling story 54th regiment most compelling ways	1
one man life full ups downs pictured film , " throne blood " , directed akira kurosawa . this film japanese re-make version famous shakespearean play , macbeth . because this film japanese film , many details differ macbeth , although basic plot story same . all plot changes , character setting differences effective choices this film because it adds different taste original form story . most plot changes film due cultural differences make plot this film natural flowing , little twist end . some detailed plot adaptations director make included washizu ( playing role macbeth ) taking over cob-web castle , miki ( playing role lady macbeth ) pregnant washizu killed his own men towards end story . medieval japan , man taking over castle not necessarily mean he emperor japan , unlike macbeth aiming king start . therefore , washizu not kill emperor , but he kill others competing castle . however , conflicts washizu other competent similar macbeth because goal they both mind achieve power . this film , miki pregnancy not seem dramatical change plot story , but thought necessary this japanese film . reason this because couple wanted their own child inherit his throne after his death . this inheriting system similar one macbeth , but this director decided add this detail reveal great desires washizu . after all killing struggles take over castle , washizu not want any other person but his child who shares his blood inherit throne . climax this film comes when hundreds soldiers washizu side points their arrows him one one hits him . this plot adaptations made this film because soldiers wanted show sign surrender . giving washizu head represented surrender . this change made film more violent thus added twist unexpected ending . making changes , it very important plot flows it natural . this sort change needed because there no fun film or story completely same original form . main character , washizu very different characteristic macbeth . washizu brave , confident , demanding more selfish than shakespearean macbeth . shogun ( similar position thane when referring macbeth ) strong , determined brave take over castle . unlike macbeth , he demanding his wife tone his speech overall strong . director probably wanted express image brave man going through one straight road towards his goal , but ending tragic death . this maybe typical image shogun during medieval japan . one thing not expressed because this characterization washizu , gradual change washizu beginning end story . this important change express because macbeth , he growing become more aggressive greedy he overcomes obstacles become king . similarly , miki characterization different form lady macbeth too . lady macbeth pretty strong woman , telling her husband what . however , miki not like her because she under circumstance where she cannot , since washizu demanding person . but overall , two characters played japanese actors very well suited this version macbeth . " throne blood " set medieval japan , when shoguns each castle fought prove strongest castle warlords . this setting very suited fit story like macbeth into . both setting lords , emperor/king , warriors . this made it possible details expressed film . example one detail one three apparitions old lady , gave washizu . when old lady told him he victorious unless wood nears neighbor comes down washizu castle . since medieval castle japan constructed top fort used forests woods one protection security methods , this apparition realistic . director chose japan setting this film , probably because many things matched original setting . technically , it completely different setting but it good enough reproduce similar story which very impressive . if people who never seen or heard macbeth happens see " throne blood " not think this film reproductive shakespearean play . this how almost perfectly macbeth throne blood matches . changes made rather improve film . washizu macbeth , both who lived fast tragic life possess lifestyle people today still learn achieve . power films stories . " throne blood " always classical perfect example successful reproductive film .	1

this movie quiet , subtle . funny heartbreaking . moving frightening . many ways it surpasses " sixth sense " me shyamalan truly " great " film , simply because i grew love this family , identify them . it shame next two films shyamalan released so incredibly frustratingly sub-par . but here , he shines , telling modern day story not-so-little green men coming earth , not friendly way . he very easily could failed here , this could turned into cheesy , b-movie , but he makes you believe . hopefully he again one day	1
keeping my usual habit discovering thinks backwards i managed view second eye film before first , but i'm reassured excellent ' making ' extra director danny pang set out make film completely disconnected first . other than theme it through our eyes we meet dead , course . joey ( qi shu ) young woman who , face failed romance , falls apart emotionally . attempt suicide unexpected side effect allowing her see ghostly figures spirits world around her . when joey discovers she pregnant lover who abandoned her , second piece puzzle falls into place , these spirits dead , waiting enter bodies infants they born . joey terrified , defensive her own unborn child . even efforts buddhist priest fail convince her this anything but hideous , unexpected curse . she keeps searching answers , but finds no comfort her discoveries . she confronted ironic twist fate come very near destroying her completely . pang brothers manage avoid various clichs ghost stories , making various spirit appearances blend right into steadily rising tension film . qi shu manages stay just this side over acting , general atmosphere film naturalistic . this lack theatricality adds unexpected reality qi shu performance , enhances anguish confusion supporting cast members like jesdaporn pholdee . altogether enjoyable effort almost level tale two sisters	-1

rather than give general review others kindly , my review focuses one aspect film , indeed one character , martha . martha dunstock known throughout film martha dumptruck . even film credits include nickname `dumptruck ' besides character surname ( evidently feeling need labour point ) . portrayed unattractive pathetically grateful any attention she given , she unwittingly provides slater character information enabling him murder student . later , when cult status `suicides ' ( , murdered students ) becomes apparent , martha attempts her own suicide walking into path traffic . but her attempt shown failure . end film martha bruised now disabled , electric wheelchair . ryder character , finished her voyage self-realisation , rejects school prom night instead invites martha stay video popcorn . martha gratefully accepts closing scenes show ryder walking corridor while martha encircles her like planet around sun . image martha her wheelchair , object pity ryder audience , signifies us fears different , not beautiful , not loved respected . martha person we all frightened becoming . she given no means solving her predicament film maker . though some us audience may fat , or disabled , or both , we may yet still fear martha , invited consider ryder protagonist journey self discovery our own , even physical social reality , we more like martha . this reason , `heathers ' fails exploration `hell ' high school ( description often used buffy/angel/ firefly joss whedon ) . those audience not thin complying western standards `beauty ' protagonists ( probably majority us ) ultimately may find so-called subversion cruel hierarchy this film just little too shallow , leaving bitter after-taste . way `fat ' people portrayed films such these unfortunately often reflect predictable , transparent absurd fixations film makers . sadly this happening even today - some ways it gotten even worse since western world decided wage ' war fat ' ( quote paul campos ) - even best it lazy film-making .	-1

there little say this movie , since i assume people interested buying this item already seen it already . but amount quality extras this dvd just breathtaking . say least , disc 2 imax version film , which time this writing not documented here amazon . imax version , well :) , shorter version film ( 1h55 ' versus 2h20 ' regular ) aspect ratio 1:66 . so if you unsure buy widescreen or fullscreen versions , i suggest buying wide , since you get ( sort ) full screen version imax one present disc 2 . then there this documentary " conquest space " which rather dull , " astronauts story " very short but interesting clip , excellent " making " juicy commentary jim lovell , pinpointing hits misses film compared real thing . $9.90 , how you not buy this jewel	1

i am huge fan wes anderson debut effort , " rushmore . " it one most original , well-written , soulful comedies teenage life ( our inability grow beyond it ) i'd ever seen . " rushmore " also great cast , led perhaps my favorite actor all time , bill murray . but then came follow-up , " royal tennenbaums , " bill murray there once again . it not coincidence " tennenbaums " not same class " rushmore " either comedy or film , it also put murray off one side , barely using him . one left speculate possibilities anderson murray teaming up where murray got spotlight 100% time . those speculations brought fruition " life aquatic steve zissou , " things generally what you would expect this team . " life aquatic " looks sounds just like movie one would expect max fisher , hero " rushmore . " it low-budget , slap-dash affair ( watch hilariously-amateurish gunfight scenes ) whimsical special effects ludicrous stabs tragedy . but blasting thing got heart , its heart melancholy , bemused visage bill murray . murray plays titular steve zissou , minor-league jacques cousteau whose best years both behind him not all great . murray captures zissou man looking into abyss his own mortality his own futility elan only he could muster . murray says more sidelong glance than many actors evoke soliloquy , fans this long-time great , " life aquatic " offers many sterling moments . but rest movie , all its heart imagination , not exceed sum its parts . it funny traditional wes anderson way , populated people who no idea how pathetic they really . there lines brilliant comedy insight . but just like aaron sorkin dialogue " few good men " " american president " " west wing " sounds exactly same regardless who speaking lines , wes anderson motif starting wear bit thin . particularly tiresome owen wilson kentucky air pilot , whose southern-ness seems play no role except wilson fulfill some outmoded stereotypes . willem dafoe , god bless him , shoots moon his german side-kick , but he brings rage intensity movie where rest cast seems so mellow you believe they more than little " baked , " so he often seems coming different movie altogether . if you love bill murray , or wes anderson , you love " life aquatic . " much big fan i am murray , i still can't rave movie . but it definitely worth your time , if only see magical wonder jaguar shark . see draw unparalled pleasure seeing jeff goldblum get shot	-1

disney remake " mighty joe young " excellent film , but nothing beats charm original film . said , i think both versions worth owning . there common thread runs through both original this remake , both share somewhat similar climatic ending . but there enough differences make two films unique quite interesting side-by-side comparisons . course disney version you state-of-the art cgi . joe looks so real , it blow your mind ! sweet tearjerker whole family enjoy . remake mjy filmed color widescreen . original " mighty joe young " you don't get state-of-the-art special effects remake , but what you get much better story which tugs all your emotions . climax film very exciting , so touching it brings tears eyes . i won't give it away not spoil it . original mjy filmed black white full screen . great news , this film finally released november 2005 original " king kong " " son kong " special collection . it most likely available single dvd well . it should winner !	1

i quite liked this movie . it isn't ever going absolute favourite mine , but it very entertaining because it good mix it comedy , drama , revenge , passion good old fun . kimberly elise ok this ( i think it would suited either angela bassat or vivica fox better ) her deliciously evil husband ( steve harris - practice heist ) excellent . he so mean you knew he'd get what coming him he sure . he just lucky his soon-to-be-ex wife so kind him inspite what he'd previously her . kimberly character make right choice end ( very predictable ) it very officer gentleman end . take cake tyler perry . he so funny - even i white chick get his humour his delivery . i especially love scene new girlfriends closet . hilarious . this really good movie should wide appeal because it got everything it . there big lesson learn it it also entertain you again again . i highly recommend it	-1
i like gangster movies am philly so i gave this movie chance . what mistake . creators painstakingly tried rip off sopranos but wound up very weak imitation . it starts horrible theme song . it obviously trying sound similar a3 song serves sopranos theme , but chock full horrible lyrics sounds like someone threw casio keyboard down stairs recorded i t.t he cast filled mediocre actors , trying vain save stupid script . one funny thing everyone film different accent , exception one guy , no one south philly accent . sal mazzotta trying real hard james gandolfini tony soprano , but i'm sorry ... he may nice guy real life , but guy couldn't act scared graveyard midnight . come ; this guy gangster ? maybe lurch adams family . this movie also plauged choppy editing poor camera work . i mean few scenes camera actually going out focus while people talking . don't they teach film school ? usually when two people talking their heads turned one angle wide two person shot , completely different angles close ups , like maybe close up stuff much later . save your money . wish i could get mine back . it long time since i saw movie so bad i felt angry ripped off seen it .	-1

overall -- all extras -- fine piece . new documentary good , if little self-serving . sound quality narration weak needs closed captioning . extra interviews photo albums excellent . shots currently flying b-17s good but should longer . if you into b-17s or wwii , you should get this one . you won't disappointed	-1
this wishy washy attempt truth . facts there parts pieces , but it not really put together well . some choices material questionable truly valuable topic . this dvd agenda not unbiased , i think it failed it overall agenda . there more than enough information pre-9/11 post-9/11 put together something more worthy accurate than this dvd attempted . if this best contrasting evidence bush administration produced after all happened white house beyond , we truly trouble . truth out there , i think this dvd tripped over them kept walking without looking down gathering all facts together . there plenty important facts things said worth listening this dvd , but this dvd maybe worth glance , but not long hard look .	-1
tamilee webb 2 dvd set best ! she you working hard without steep learning curve . if you read my other reviews , then you know i hate videos complicated steps or poor instructions . tamilee knows her stuff she shares knowlege you . you learn how each move right way every time . weight loss dvd my favorite , but you should note it requires step . first few times i tried it , my legs felt like jelly afterwards . when i able get through whole workout , there tremendous feeling accomplishment . lower body workout strenuous without exhausting . when i've complete video , i feel energized rather than depleted . tamilee cueing efficient her timing excellent . there only few minor negative points ; music little bland two women who exercising tamilee too perfect seem real . i really appreciate it when workout videos show normal looking people . said , these videos two my favorites . i never seem tire them .	-1

jurassic park : lost world isn't quite bad lot reviewers say , although they certainly entitled their opinions---isn't what this site all ? any rate , while sequel loses some its originality awe-inspiring moments , it well action film , rexs attacking trailer nail-biting sequence . there lot predictability scientists vs . hunters formula , but film like this , one accept predictablility if it handled professionally . effects camera work par excellence . first film , jeff goldblum underplays his role , perhaps bit too much this time --- he almost seems bored ? julianne moore who go more " acting " roles okay heroine , little more exciting than laura dern . i too agree decision go politically correct give goldblum african-american daughter , especially since there no background add this relationship . pete postelthwaite arliss howard villains appropriately cast . while not big hit its prequel , lost world entertained me	-1

so what y'all smoking ? sure , jessica simpson sing ( especially her beginnings 1999 lukewarm smash sweet kisses ) , but not particularly this dvd . she some serious vocal affections hinder her natural sound distort her pop croonings ( she comes off britney wannabe ) . interestingly her more tepid boring tunes this skin sound best ( including " my way home " ) . her rendition " take my breath away " decent , touching " you don't let go " ( her " i love because you love ... me " nothing less than beautiful ) , but her awful performance " angels " falls extremely short expectations ( she sounded much better vh1 divas live ) . end , her reality tour 2004 decent but much less stellar concert given girl who talent . throw out britney-trademarked growl , jessica , odd vocal quirk makes it sound though she choking back song rather than singing it you soar . decent , but not great .	-1
i read one negative review this film i would like clarify statements made it . i am russian so , obviously , i like this film . it typical russian humor , it farce , so not look higher meanings jokes , it makes fun social standards soviet regime well people who served it so well . it features some best russian actors we love seeing acting ; they sing movie it lovely well . if you tough judge movies , then please make sure you know soviet history bit understand humor differs what you see american movies before you call it crap . i not see why there should problem characters not talking first ten minutes movie . fact , it just few minutes during which you shown premise movie . cyrillic letters not making sense : this russian movie you bound see everything written our gibberish alphabet . besides , movie begins cruise foreign country ( it shot baku , azerbajan but supposed turkey ) . language spoken locals well signs buildings gibberish - it made up specially movie . said , i want say few words plot . semen semenovich diligent russian economist goes cruise , where he gets acquainted mafia mob right hand , kozodoev , whose assignment pick up diamonds supplier deliver it back moscow via cast his arm . during one last stops , semen semenovich gets mistaken kozodoev ends up cast jewels inside it . he returns moscow , semen contacts police . now , he pose bait escape traps elaborately planted mafia . i already said , movie fantastic . just remember it farce . no , there not slapstick humour . open-minded enjoy ! oh , way , all jewelry you see screen authentic . it mentioned beginning film crew would like thank all soviet individuals who lend their gems filming .	1
this great cyber thriller sandra bullock excellent job portraying female computer geek . directing , casting , sets , music first class . those us computer industry those who not both enjoy it . i'm senior engineer worked computers twenty plus years i saw it when it first released . when i first saw this movie , only one thing amused me , wolfenstein game , it movies only shortcoming . time movie released game old news they carry how game state art . it didn't ring true those us bleeding edge gaming community . they should not put game or came up something looked high tech since game dates it . perhaps snobbery , but true nonetheless . i said before it only shortcoming . this movie excellent mood like hitchcockian or grisham thriller . well paced it keeps you guessing what next . threat identity theft large computer companies failing because faulty software today only shows how respect movie ahead it time . i never tire watching it . dvd quality good , but unfortunately it not include any extras . still well worth buying copy	-1

grudge american remake japanese horror film . what different grudge it non-linear story line . first you think it three separate stories , then just two , finally you realize your seeing interspersed storylines past present they meet end film -- filling you curse what happening . ( think momento identity)the scariest part story , it pretty creepy , because curse born first murder kills indescriminately anyone who enters house . not immediately . not same way . no matter what you , you can't outwit it . if you house , it got your number . scariest thing most people involved innocent -- they nothing original killing , when seeing ghost while shocked , they tried help . yet , still they died . there might way avoid curse but unfortunately , it didn't get carried ou t.t here no cgi/fx -- everything low key creepy . i'd almost say this more psychological horror than monster coming get you horror but never they less -- you'll probably end up sleeping lights wondering if you should evere go into house you don't know anything again	-1
plenty reviews described this amazing movie . i'd just like add note meaning title . most people ignored it - one reviewer thought it reference frequency shooting up . ( ex ) brit , who grew up scotland , when i saw it , some time ago , i just automatically assumed something quite different . first - trainspotting actual hobby britain . remember this small country dense active rail network . lots people really , really interested trains , but trainspotting kind very lowest-grade interest . trainspotters stand around stations , or major rail junctions , or marshalling yards , just collect train facts - usually engine numbers , sometimes appearances some particular kind rolling stock . all they - make lists ! ( or sometimes trade number lists other spotters , or exult size their list ) . so image trainspotter low-energy person , very conventional outlook , probably standing hours rain shabby raincoat ... one who pretty much given up ever doing anything exciting who absolutely needs get life ! collecting train numbers basically pure , time-consuming obsession . collecting stamps or beer mats or matchbooks , or any thousand other odd things people collect , sometimes dimension - artistic interest , investment , etc - train numbers lead nowhere . so me title " trainspotting " sardonic reminder monotonous , meaningless " normal " life guys rebelling against trying escape - unwisely , but desperately - their drug usage . it background against which vivid certainly scary picture painted . hope this helpful . would interesting hear anyone associated movie if that right - i say , it just natural ., automatic interpretation me . ps - after reading many , many reviews - why it so many otherwise literate people just cannot spell words definite definitely ? many keep thinking there there somewhere ... one even wrote " defiantly " which gave interesting unintended twist , course passed spell-check ... oh well	1

we all knew form previews this movie tom cruse hit man jamie foxx cab driver . , tom commandeers jamie his cab night killing . problem , me when mild-mannered , soft-spoken cab driver turns into macho operative then super hero . max ( jamie foxx ) cab driver twelve years . although he dreams aspirations ; that all they . after twelve years he still cab drive . yet , when he picks up sophisticated lady lawyer , he charms her his quick wit knowledge ; point she gives him her phone without him even asking it . i not buy minute . his next fare vincent ( tom cruse ) . vincent wants hire max cab night willing pay well beyond max usual nigh t-t ime take . yet max resist . ( why ? i don't understand this . ) reluctantly max agrees vincent request but only after vincent really pushes issue . then , everything changes when max -- accident -- finds out vincent killer . , vincent plans killing more people max his wheel man . remember , max mild-mannered , passive type person . so he not only fears his life but he scared out his wits . so , he allows vincent intimidate him into going killing spree . course all not go planned . without giving away plot ( if you call it ) max forced vincent confront some very bad people -- his own . yet , while scared out his wits surrounded gun wheeling henchmen ; max able bluff very bad man putting macho act . i not buy second . after more killings , max still scared but decides vincent must stopped . so , without regard his own life ( anymore ) , max makes all out effort stop vincent . , course , not work . vincent leaves max precarious situation continues go after his next victim . so max , his now obsession stop vincent , overpowers police officer who arresting him , takes police officer gun , goes after vincent stop him . i not buy millisecond . i am glad i not buy this movie .	-1
i saw this movie years ago , but didn't remember much it , except some songs , basic story . i also saw " nights cabiria " , which story taken . i love musicals , i think shirley maclaine very talented . she very sweet charity hope valentine , one can't help wanting happy ending her . so why i think this movie awful ? first all , some dialogue so repetitious it became irritating -- how many times you listen charity say " fickle finger fate " over over without wanting hit mute button ? also , some scenes went -- especially elevator scene . -- intermission totally unnecessary . but worst disappointment me musical numbers . i didn't like any them --- they so far over top silly . bob fosse must thrown everything into them he could --- instead letting dancers songs carry numbers , he so much busyness all them -- too many people , costumes didn't fit story , silly moves -- they all went past point enjoyment . i fast forwarded thrua couple them just get them over . i never before any movie . this could so much better -- story good , charactors good -- but whole thing should toned down . movie could 30 minutes shorter if there some trimming . it entirely too long . also --- all stop action -- what all ? i know , i know -- it show progress story , but it distraction . i didn't like movie glad when it over .	-1
i wholeheartedly agree all glowing reviews this site , this movie probably one most magical i ever seen ( i'm 41 ) . however , pg rating because some coarse language which amazon not mention specifically . i watched it my daughter when she 8 , since i seen movie when it first came out , i couldn't recall exactly what it . well .... it word i believe also g-d , so if you prefer your kids not hear kind language movie you chosen then you might want hold off this one few more years ( although they may hearing those words worse their school bus anyway ) . there also scene where girlfriend comes spend night her shirt gets unbuttoned you see her bra .... so just know depending your child level knowledge sex , etc you may get questions you aren't ready !! anyway my daughter four years older now i would feel much more comfortable watching this her now she " pre-teen " . other than this it terrific movie definitely one most creative tom hanks ' career .	1

there many movies sports , some very good , some really bad this one falls into very good category . " goal ! " typical sports movie exceptionally talented young amateur who given chance shine among professionals win heart girl he loves . however , " goal ! " works this premise makes it fresh entertaining . director danny cannon complete support fifa newcastle united it shows , he created some most realist remarkable football scenes film . kuno becker very good santiago , although times he overshadowed other members cast . it seems if he lacked some presence screen . however , he still young , certainly improve years . alessandro nivola steals movie his performance gavin , notorious football star whose convoluted public life begins take its toll his performance field . cannon approach story may seem clichï¿½d , but movie never boring nor tiresome . sure , he follows every rule " sport movies handbook " but he it care , good eye love sport . just like sport movies should . movie flows smoothly remarkable football scenes santiago struggle his own personal demons . while times it seems both cannon becker more comfortable sports scenes , movie dose drama well handled completes enjoyable experience . even though it frankly predictable most time , it transmits passion , emotions love game few movies . that why " goal ! " considered successful important film . it first film football soccer transmits emotions made sport most popular sport world . that got worth something . it may not perfect sports film ; however , " goal ! " beginning adventure , hopefully , new way make football movies . this initial film what called " goal ! trilogy " delivers high energy entertainment fans non-fans sport .	-1
this dvd surpassed my highest expectations . when i ordered dvd , i not aware these performances all taken european tv shows . i thought these performances actually recorded live festival , expecting grainy pictures poor audio quality . imagine my surprise seeing buddy guy introduce big mama thornton she walks out onto indoor stage set , not unlike " saturday night live " . despite black white picture , i felt like i really there studio while she sang ! audio quality really good . any context , any stage , these performers all presence spare . considering source ( euro tv ) age film ( some over 40 years old ) , i completely blown away . there no disappointment anywhere this dvd , what great variety classic blues ! electric guitars , acoustic guitars , slide guitar work , male vocalists , female vocalists , chicago style , delta style , slow tunes , upbeat tunes , this dvd it all , absolute best business ! i would strongly recommend this dvd anyone . whether you new blues , diehard fan like myself , or just want see direct ancestors your favorite rock bands , check out this dvd .	1

there countless reviews here , so i make this one short . first , i am always amazed when i meet people who say they figured " usual suspects " out middle movie . i one totally floored . i not see it coming , very surprised [ no spoilers ] . film analyzed , dissected , discussed , over 500 reviews , written quite extensively . however , one things i don't understand why someone would give film one or two stars . there many ' good ' films really never appealed me , however , i see although i might not like film , it good film . therefore , i would not think giving such low marks film this reason ; but would give my analysis what i thought weak film : yet , i would still give film its earned accolades . this film great however . film , " usual suspects " very good very twisted complicated plot . this only makes film better watch . i like these types mysteries . especially ones you can't figure out . specifically when they not spell it out viewer what happening ; but suddenly you find yourself saying , " wow , i never expected ! " these types films twists turns appeal me . if they appeal you , then this film you . i would highly recommend you not only rent film , but purchase it , it belongs your dvd collection . this smart , intelligently written , wonderfully acted suspense thriller take you roller coaster mystery , which keep you riveted your seat . highly recommended .	1

this dvd valuable piece broadway history , it documents process involved recording one landmark cast albums all time , " company " . it interesting see mechanics involved , naturally , but what sticks you determination these tired actors ( they recorded sunday after opening night , their day off ) get permanent record this brilliant , groundbreaking musical . it fun watch them subtly interact if stage . it also touching see these actors they looked thirty-four years ago -- barbara barrie before her harrowing cancer battle , beth howland charles kimbrough before sitcom fame , elaine stritch before england , marriage , widowhood , beating alcoholism . intriguing backstage story lead actor dean jones ' impending departure show still moving ; his misery over crumbling marriage back california led deal director harold prince bring show into new york -- then leave role larry kert . certainly there some wonderful performances captured here ( dean jones , teri ralston silvery vocals , beth howland hysterical patter song , pamela myer run through what may greatest song written new york , " hundred people " ) . but centerpiece indeed elaine stritch struggle get good track down what she called her " three-act play " , " ladies who lunch " . memorable first night , her fatigue gets better her nuance gives way angry shouting . her eyes , wide wild exhaustion , tell volumes . her quiet , dignified exit get rest while orchestra records backing track pure theatre . her triumphant return studio nail perfect take ( indeed , film documents take actually made album ) thrills . she must known this would " one " , she made sure her hair her makeup perfect ( down full false eyelashes) -- she looks beautiful sounds spectacular . stritch present-day commentary protests she matinee later day , hence full stage face . whatever reason , her tough-as-nails beauty shines . dvd extras add fun commentary ( pennebaker , hal prince typically feisty stritch ) photos original production -- i wish they added more ! this very much worth it if you student theatre history or theatre music	1

i wondering what watch this morning saw criterion edition dvd kihachi okamoto " sword doom " my shelf , i thought watching it after silent short wladyslaw starewicz sort light entertainment . not expecting much , i put it my dvd player prepared relax coming two hours . i seen copy this dvd my local library week ago , i never heard anything director i remembered , back cover spoke lots violence blood , made me expect exploitation film vein seijun suzuki only samurais full color . so i surprised bit disappointed when film began black white . but i soon disabused . films black white photography stunning example use light i seen some 60s japanese films ( e.g. seijun suzuki branded kill ) . shot stark contrast , film always seems bit overexposed , creating atmosphere witch viewer may already feel some pain characters , harshness period depicted , through his own constant effort eyes while watching . characters strain stress , atmosphere tautness matched films style . widescreen format used its fullest cinematographer hiroshi murai , almost every frame prime example staging camera , achieving awe-inspiring compositions which mirror characters emotions obsessions , always bringing directors intentions light most original way . editing meticulous , always right spot , its best not only enhancing films atmosphere flow , but deepening our understanding characters psychological profiles . this combination camerawork editing makes film formal level one finest i've ever seen . but complementing this emotional richness speaks directors own experience , life he witnessed during his time army second world war . assistant director amongst others mikio naruse right after war , we witness okamoto " sword doom " already possession not only full-fledged independent perspective life itself , but also cinematic skill , only few directors able achieve put use history cinema . essay accompanying dvd-edition , film-scholar geoffrey o'brien compares okamoto contemporaries like seijun suzuki akira kurosawa , but places him under both , calling him only very competent genre-director , he fails reach under films surface find sense films undertaking besides its obvious merits , when fact okamoto this film alone must ranked humanist director par names like kurosawa , ozu mizoguchi . his clear moral standpoint he still miles ahead formal brilliance playful nihilistic stance seijun suzuki 60s films or other genre directors this time . whatever suzukis merits ( those his colleagues ) their own may , their filmic rebellion one against established way filmmaking , rebellion against restrictions made studios wanted traditional clear-cut products would make maximum profit . but kihachi okamoto , least " sword doom " , isn't just rebelling against industry , but against society could bring such industry existence . film subversive nature goes so far , it reverses assumed creative restrictions , way comparable " dogme " -filmmaking 90s .

when fantasia came out 1938 , it bombed . many years later , movie received acclaim it deserved . fantasia enchanted me since i child , i eagerly awaited fantasia 2000 . possibilities ! i sure disney would come up something rival original . what i saw humorless , boring mish-mash only few bright spots . opening segment whales flying through space embarrassingly bad . silly flamingos also fell flat . donald duck noah terrific . gershwin piece ok , but not fantasia . what should crowning achievement , forest nymph battling save her beloved forest , predictable stale . this film almost complete waste my time money . i heartily , heartily , endorse orginal fantasia timeless classic all ages	-1
i say , it took me while getting around seeing this . i thought " silence lambs " good - it featured great performance anthony hopkins , rest it .... good . but it , far i concerned . it just didn't really click me , it wasn't anything near great movie i'd hoping , so when its sequel released i didn't feel any great need rush out get it soon it released . bit surprisingly though , i thought " hannibal " really great once i finally see it . everyone said it more geared toward horror than " silence ... " ( which fine me ) it may , marginally . but much more than , it just better horror movie than its predecessor , it also better thriller better drama movie , my opinion . hopkins just good , if not better , than he dr. hannibal lecter first time around , while i usually don't like recasting roles movie ( unless actor or actress playing creature or monster or something where you don't see their real face or hear their real voice , even there they sometimes end up getting mannerisms wrong ) julianne moore great job stepping into clarice starling role originally played jodie foster . movie centers around hunt find lecter only victim his original , pre-incarceration , carnage survive - thoroughly despicable pedophile who avoided ever charged his crimes cutting deal prosecutors give evidence against lecter . it seems like " hannibal " changed tract " silence " implying most if not all lecter victims may horrendous individuals who some way brought his wrath down upon themselves . whether that truth or whether it just this one victim who so reprehensible , effect create foil hannibal who even more evil than he . hannibal lecter himself , well , he not ' good guy ' this movie ; he , though , presented very cryptic shades grey . his behaviors contradict one but so way feels real , he much more interesting character this time around . clarice also ; she comes across here character who somehow traumatized , perhaps even mentally unbalanced , deep down but supresses it so well it took genius like lecter ever see it , that what so intrigued him first place . one possible interpretation things overall ( this just one many potential takes it ; movie briefly subtly hints so many different things you could take away just anything it - making it great source conversation movie-lovers ) hannibal lecter person who had/has potential great goodness within himself but chose evil , while clarice starling potential great darkness hannibal-level violence her , but chose good , chose fact make her career opposing those who give same darkness . lot food thought this one ( no pun intended ) . great performances all around ; notable addition hopkins moore brilliant gary oldman plays lecter nemesis chronically overlooked under-rated ray liotta plays unlikable , rather creepy fbi agent who constantly odds starling . very , very engaging wel-made movie	-1

this movie funniest sight gags movies i've seen past . this movies plot isn't confusing people may think , because jim abrahams ( director ) always made sense all his movies . movie starts off anthony ( i forgot his last name , narrorator movie ) how mafia hussled people their money casinos around las vegas . it shows games casino people played where " you possibly couldn't win " , that how they became rich . then you go back time sicily 1901 shows how vincenzo , anthony father , grew up how he became part mafia . after vincenzo found out package he delivering , containing cocaine , supposed given gangster his father worked , he chased became wanted person . he separated his mother after friends his family hid im butt donkey during escape gangsters chasing after him . he swam across ocean arrived new york . that how movie became what it . this movie basically sight comedy , fart jokes get old , but this movie leave you laughing till end . i suprised this movie didn't leslie nielsen . i look this movie think myself " if this movie this hilarious without leslie nielsen , thin how much funnier it would've him .

this movie still rocks after all these years since it first came out . excellent energetic movie start . plot cutesy . it serves vehicle wonderful selection songs dance sequences . however , i think this version movie missing few scenes ? i would rate this movie version 5 stars it unedited me . if memory serves me , didn't alex receive letter her friend , hannah , when alex discovered hannah passed away ? isn't there reconnection end mickey alex ( girl)friend whom latter dating ? wasn't there more story build-up alex her boss ? if this version cut anyway , i prefer getting complete unedited version . i find this version incomplete somehow . but jennifer beals looks terrific one wonders why she didn't star more movies her generation	-1

while average movie watcher may not recognize name betsy russell ( private school , cheerleader camp ) , those us males who grew up 1980s , weaned hours dedicated cable viewing , know her something akin goddess world dumb , teen comedies basically two reasons ... she one fine babe , she didn't seem mind showing some skinage , evident film tomboy ( 1985 ) , among others . originally released crown international pictures , film directed herb freed ( graduation day , survival game ) stars , i mentioned , ms. russell . also appearing gerard christopher ( " superboy " ) , kristi somers ( hardbodies ) , richard erdman ( blue gardenia ) , late eric douglas ( flamingo kid ) , youngest son actor kirk douglas . russell plays tomasina `tommy ' boyd , tomboy through through who spends her days working cars , shooting hoops boys , riding her motorcycle . after fairly schmaltzy pointless opening sequence showing tommy girl , playing baseball boys , scoring run , ultimately hugging her father ( who apparently astronaut air force ) , all slow motion montage form , we're now present tommy rises bed proceeds shower ... some skin but no goodies ... yet ... man , you wouldn't think you could jealous sponge ... anyway , tommy works mechanic chester garage , dumpy filling station where she often visited her girly girl friend seville ( somers ) , aspiring broadway dancer who seems little problem sleazing her way up ladder success , evident later film . after witnessing dance audition seville her troupe , one performed some potential financial backers ( surprisingly enough they declined investing seville her rotten routine ) , we're back garage big time stock car driver/professional pretty boy randy starr ( christopher ) , who tommy got serious crush ... seems randy hired local rich infinitely sleazy dink named ernie leeds , jr. race him , randy offers tommy invitation come leeds ' house check out his boss stock car . after this we see seville auditioning donut commercial , whoring it up good , followed tommy seville heading leeds ' house where tommy randy race around motocross bikes ( one point tommy crashes swampy morass , resulting her revealing her tommy `guns , if only get out her wet clothes ... hootchie mama ! ) . following this there party sequence leeds ' house ( parachute pants far eye see ) , tommy randy hook up , evident overly long montage sequence featuring pair engaging all sorts outdoor activities , but eventually they falling out tommy shows randy up race track while important sponsor attendance , result pair deciding race each other settle once all who best driver ... while tomboy pure 1980s teenage hokum through through , it fairs better than its counterparts based solely presence betsy russell her generous `assets ' , her willingness put them display . movie itself actually played like one , long series mentos commercials . one example this early tommy riding her motorcycle work she stops off engage game basketball some local chumps . through bit creative editing russell makes all her shots , but then here kicker ... she leaving , she climbs aboard her motorcycle one dudes tosses her ball . she catches it one hand , puts it up , swoosh ! it goes ... she drives off yahoos begin high fivin ' each other , apparently overjoyed fact they've just emasculated losing girl their own sport . i learn lot things this film , including following ... 1 . i'd give my left gonasticle betsy russell loofa . 2 . pretentious , forgettable pop songs 1980s , often featured films like this , generally included meaningless lyrics like `you got magic , i got fire ' . 3 . nothing gets women hotter than chasing them around town your muscle car , throwing constant barrage catcalls their direction . 4 . when sign warns `severe tire damage ' , they ain't kidding . 5 . untalented bimbos could manage find success given their willingness whore it up . 6 . someone other than jimmy `j . . ' walker actually used phrase `dy-no-mite!' 1980s . 7 . when doing television commercial donuts performers actually get paid donuts . 8 . goofy , slow motion montages great way pad out film . 9 . when waiting woman meet you date it probably not good idea let her walk you while you're watching porn she'll think you're some kind skeevy perv . 10 . apparently , world stock car racing , slapping jet engine onto your vehicle isn't considered illegal modification . performances passable movie like this ( although idea betsy russell tomboy seemed bit farfetched ) , but writing pretty lousy ( this one predictable they come ) . i seriously doubt anyone sitting edge their seat end this one , wondering if plucky tommy would beat arrogant randy race , thus validating tommy belief woman anything well man . i love these kinds films , though , they take superficial mask female empowerment while passing copious amounts nekkid female flesh ( russell character only female came off remotely decent here ) . i gag little some schmaltz-laden montages but overall , i'd say this entertaining , three star ( out five ) feature , extra star thrown ms. russell . picture quality this bci dvd release , presented widescreen ( 1.85 : 1 ) , looks pretty decent , dolby digital stereo audio comes through well enough . there aren't any extras , except few trailers some other bci dvd releases their crown international classics ( i wouldn't necessarily refer some many them `classics ' ) series including hunk ( 1987 ) , beach girls ( 1982 ) , jocks ( 1987 ) , my chauffer ( 1986 ) . cookieman108	-1

i am continually impressed movies mexico . these movies spun around very simple close-to-life stories , but superlative acting , cinematography , background score direction makes them extremely interesting , intriguing , thought-provoking entertaining . story starts grandpa rodrigo birthday reluctant gathering family members . his daughter , two sons two diagonally opposite cousins ( roco rodrigo ) . tense volatile atmosphere dinner table quickly erupts into heated dialog ( over grandpa rodrigo son marriage young demure girl ) . predictably , grandpa rodrigo massive heart-attack he passes away . without much delay , his read inheritance distributed . amidst all materialistic distribution , nobody seems pay much attention grandpa wish his ashes submerged sea acapulco . days , his ashes lay golden urn . flustered everyone nonchalant behavior , roco grabs urn starts heading towards acapulco vintage mercedes . vintage , however , inheritance gift rodrigo jr.

you know , criterion collection long leader providing classic films best possible condition , first laserdisc later dvd . when it comes film restoration , they're certainly among best companies out there . yet , it my feeling company largely unknown outside relatively small but dedicated group film enthusiasts , whose passion art cinema equals criterion . well , , plus fact company largely focused their attention foreign films mainstream moviegoing public never heard . sure , there exceptions , such their first-class hitchock releases ( notorious , spellbound , rebecca few others ); bona-fide classics like spartacus , stones ' gimme shelter ; few oddball modern choices : royal tennenbaums , armageddon (?) , rock (??) . which why i so happy find couple cult sci-fi films their catalog few years back . both original version blob ( 1958 ) , sorely underrated fiend without face filled me hope maybe , just maybe , these folks capable something more . fact , trailers all four films this collection included bonus materials fiend . now , films themselves : haunted strangler corridors blood vehicles boris karloff , who his sixties when they made . he many times before ( would continue ) , karloff plays mad doctor-type . corridors better two , young christopher lee supporting role ruthless killer . neither film could really called " classic , " but both solid , low-budget chillers fans karloff and/or lee enjoy . atomic submarine more straight sci-fi adventure story , title vehicle facing off against underwater ufo . again , this " " picture all way , but it retains some charm spite overuse newsreel footage . first man into space treads more familiar territory , organism space inhabits body astronaut . thing craves blood , so you guess what happens next . not bad little film , but probably least bunch . i applaud criterion making these films available pristine condition . i'm sure there audience more same type films . only downfall this collection -- all criterion discs -- price .	-1

sometimes there seems no rhyme or reason combinations movies they come up these 2-packs but " mullholland drive " " swimming pool " they came up quirky combo . if you not like david lynch those who make movies mold then you should know going just avoid these two . but if you like quirky films force you think figure out what hell just happened movie , then this well-suited pair . " mulholland drive " written directed david lynch certainly more style than substance , lynch creating his more surrealistic film yet . there might those who think this some sort film noir because there scene where couple hard-boiled cops show up spout film noir type dialogue . but there bits pieces different film genres throughout film , which clue tapestry lynch tale . when second main character drama , betty ( naomi watts ) , gets off plane hollywood ready pursue her quest become star , it never dawned me there more kindly old couple wishes her well drive off limosine . betty moves into apartment , only discover rita , who apparently suffered amnesia after her near death experiences , taking shower . betty canada , so she opts helping rita rather than calling police . two become friends more than friends couple best sex scenes seen movie last decade ( they also serve underscore how unsexy most sex scenes movies today ) . " mulholland drive " movie hollywood , or more appropriately dream hollywood . it means something rita , who remember her real name , pulls one she uses movie poster " gilda . " betty plucky young kids sticks who wants star . unwritten rule such people they would anything achieve their dream sense lynch film just flips dream over looks nightmare side equation . however , i no problem idea many those who watch this film " muholland drive " not come close making sense them until second time they see it many those people not going make effort . those us who seen lynch other films , most notably " eraserhead " " blue velvet , " we knew going probably going necessary . i mean , come . this david lynch people . what you expect ? " swimming pool , " i would say it more sensual than it erotic , although ultimately nudity this film secondary story . sarah morton ( charlotte rampling ) british writer crime fiction who apparently find no joy her writing , her popularity , her publisher , or any idea any other writer might writing something worth reading well . everyone waiting next installment her detective she uninspired . so her publisher ( charles dance ) offers her use his villa france place where she retreat come up new book . once there sarah explores house , taking notice leaf covered swimming pool back . she also begins write , although we no idea what she writing , sarah seems productive happy . then julie ( ludivine sagnier ) , daughter her publisher shows up unexpected guest . not only because sarah assumed she would alone , but because she not know he daughter . if anything , sarah waiting him show up so she get little relaxation her rest . instead julie shows up violates not only sarah privacy but here sense propriety . julie tends walk around topless pool apparently shows no sense discrimination bringing home men sleep . we know sarah disapproves such practices , but this not stop her watching julie , whether she swimming villa pool or making love some strange man . it then becomes clear not only julie becoming part sarah novel , but something going happen . " swimming pool " usually described thriller , but strikes me off mark . it more mystery , but subtle way , which explains why it difficult talk director franï¿½ois ozon film without giving away too much . this sort film where you going go back least watch end film again , if not entire thing start finish ( just like " mulholland drive " ) , make sure you understand what happened . what helped me out untangling this film most it i kept asking what sarah writing . there clearly connection what happening what sarah writing , but i kept waiting ozon show us what , which , end , only goes show how much i fooled this film . this regard film ends up surprising rather than shocking , keeping subtlety sensuality film . although they both quirky films they certainly odd decidedly different ways it interesting see which these two you end up preferring . last piece advice not watch them same week ( watching them back back would incredibly weird things your brain ) .	-1

premise this movie competent but quiet unexciting accountant ( pignon ) getting fired no particular reason except someone go he considered expendable , something zero eyes his employer coworkers . opening scene says it all when he willingly omitted annual company photo staff : he not missed anyone . pignon very depressed considering ending it all when his new neighbor adjoining balcony intervenes . neighbor idea help him : he should pretend he gay then his employer too concerned " correctness " fire him -- they'll bend over backwards pretend they're not prejudiced . neighbor ( retired industrial psychologist ) doctors up some photos head accountant ( pignon ) bodies some gays entering gay night club . these sent anonymously pignon boss , quickly photocopied spread throughout company . president quickly decides it would very bad strategy fire pignon , because these days , they wouldn't want alienate gay market , particularly since they make condoms . it sounds like thin one-joke movie , but actors good enough it quite amusing doesn't drag . gerard depardieu ( very funny guy ) plays santini , captain company rugby team who aggressively heterosexual makes disparaging remarks gays constantly . he warned he better buddy up pignon ( coworkers who basically playing joke him ) or else he'll get fired . subplots involve pignon relationship his ex-wife estranged son . there very funny scene pignon gay pride parade . whole film made less obnoxious episode involving gay-bashing ( violent ) makes it clear subject really rather serious , even if film funny .	-1

chinatown shows up top five all-time films so many people , it probably difficult say what it exactly people find so wonderful it . absolute magnetism deft performance its emerging star , jack nicholson , no doubt one its stronger assets . while story brilliantly unique quite interesting , it not exciting , per se ; it dutifully structured detective genre , aside occasional outburst violence , rather quiet cerebral . screenwriter storyteller robert towne scenes dialogue spare but sparkling , cinematography film editing . perhaps its greatest asset its director , roman polanski who , his art set directors , magically re-creates los angeles it 30 . whether staging scenes against bleached white adobe , palm-lined street twilight , or office bathed venetian blind shadows , polanski gets perfect , painterly shot every frame . he effortlessly guides all his actors -- lead supporting alike -- subtle , but heartfelt performances . this one those movies where actors seem believe they themselves time place they actually characters they portraying . add all this moody , evocative score its unforgettable love theme suddenly economical becomes expansive , filling screen dazzling movie-making its best . devastatingly powerful last scene screen legend , rivalled , perhaps , only casablanca .	1

i remember how movie hit me when it first released . i not yet 30 , fairly recently married myself , pretty relentless seeing every new non-traditional american movie i could . mazursky personal favourite , especially bob carol , next stop blume love . he telling stories no one else dared tell -- no cross-country mythic hippes , no foul tongue-lashing nicholson vehicle , not even fonda ( jane ) showing just how sexy glum . jill clayburgh perfectly suited era -- attractive without wondrous , teeth imperfect shown up close without apology , dancing her panties ( clayburgh signature would later become tedious ) -- most all her genuine humanity , self-deprecating manner heartbreaking vulnerability . she both movie star clean normal , same time . looking film now , it fascinating try distinguishing whether its original power any currency . i showed film college class first-year students , all women coincidence , they split -- many thought it coy many others startled greater power this film over sex city -- what emerged seminar , what i think sets this movie apart " its time nothing more " , women film viewed mature ( good way ) , searching human beings , while quartet gals sex city seen desperately clinging their notions youth exclusion their own deeper needs desires . class really taken aback when they realized women mazursky film same age samantha , carrie co . , alone , makes " unmarried woman " worth adding important film lists	1

this very good movie i watched my " horror classics collection : 50 pack " ( asin : b0001hagtm ) i got amazon ( under $20.00 ! ) . so first off , i would recommend buying 50 pack where you get 2 other vincent price movies ( bat last man earth ) 47 other good movies almost same price buying this movie itself . far this movie goes , there few suspenseful parts you wonder what going happen . mainly , movie give you some memorable quotes , vincent price always deliver great voice his . all characters good job acting ( typist great scream ! ) . some parts seem bit unbelievable some questions don't seem get answered , but who really cares ? only 75 minutes long , this movie better than most horror movies come out today unoriginal go shock value . so while this might more murder mystery than " horror " movie , it worth watch you'll satisfied end ... unless course , you not like black white movies , if case , then you probably wouldn't reading this review . p.s. i love gary . taylor review when he says : " price plays it slightly prissy , very high-camp manner tremendous dose black humor which he so famous . " that so true	-1
acting especially leads ( moon so-ri sol kyung-gu ) fantastic ; moon performance convinced me she truly disabled . also , pace felt faster than it actually . beautiful cinematography , like so many korean films . i saw this seoul when it opened , two native korean friends who also loved it . while i remain little ambivalent how so many acclaimed korean dramas portray rape , this film able make protagonists ' disabilities secondary plot not focus . sometimes difficult watch , this movie wouldn't made hollywood , it definitely worth watching	1
edges lord received very little publicity when it released , american release went straight dvd . yet this film demands watching more than once . haley joel osment gives possibly his best performance ever , says lot considering his outstanding efforts sixth sense , pay it forward , a.i. , second hand lions . he portrays young jewish boy poland during nazi occupation , who sent live catholic family rural poland , where he must pose catholic order survive . only person , besides family he living , who knows his true identity , village priest played william dafoe who gives understated yet excellent performance . drama intense throughout , but it builds even more intense climax . all children movie give remarkable performances which further serve show true nature what it like live under nazi occupation whether jew or christian . this movie not missed , it movie should watched together families children above age 1	1

poster owen coughlan pretty much said it all , but it warrants seconded . taking purely subjective approach - concentrating those genres , films amp ; filmmakers which hold special significance him - martin scorsese makes not only these subjects live breathe , but captures entire history american film manner informs , excites even inflames viewer measure scorsese own archivist passion medium . his refusal tout his own body work , soft-pedaling impressive filmography anyone assembled , order keep focus men women who sculpted built artform first seduced him wide-eyed four-year-old both touching typical scorsese reverence his forebears . many lesser-known neglected films sampled here serve dual purpose : one , dowsing rods pointing worthwhile movies left off general-consensus , afi-type lists ; secondly , reminders we've all seen extraordinary films dismissed or ignored critics , public , even ourselves earlier points . you'll finish watching this great doc champing bit go rent roaring 20s phenix city story sure , but you'll also want begin your own voyage rediscovery through 100 years movie history wide eyes seeing new exotic old once-familiar . can't ask more than any historical documentary - well , i'd've loved this even more twice length , but let not get greedy ..	1

rule #1 gothic film criticism : products hollywood ( this year disgrace 2006 ) absolute tripe -- worthless or less than worthless . it should therefore come no surprise best lycanthrope movies recent times both foreign : british-luxembourg production " dog soldiers " canadian gem " ginger snaps . " differences two films striking ; while " dog soldiers " focuses very manly men encountering werewolves scottish highlands , " ginger snaps " concerns two teenage sisters , one whom metamorphosing into werewolf . first film inevitably recalls " night living dead " inasmuch title soldiers barricade themselves farmhouse withstand lycanthropes ' onslaught . " ginger snaps , " however , calls mind depalma " carrie " associating onset menstruation dark supernatural forces . both films share common bond extraordinary imagination -- both present very appealing/magnetic characters facing most horrific situations . all working-class infantrymen " dog soldiers " portrayed sympathetically , yet without sentimentality : they true iron men -- " balls british steel " -- unable destroy their supernatural opponents , but capable looking death straight eye while going down fighting . samurai ! girls " ginger snaps " comparably impressive : suburban goths , they obsessed idea violent , indeed gruesome death . furthermore , title character ( acted superbly katharine isabelle ) superior -- gifted cynical insight into world , insight which seems far beyond her years apparent experience . effect , she visual verbal artist cruelly destined slow transformation into four-footed monstrosity ! much victim predator , she seems more ambiguous figure than heroic warriors " dog soldiers . " nevertheless , she never loses one interest or sympathy ; even monster , she least avoids banality she spent her life loathing . despair mingled delirium becomes dominant mood " ginger snaps . " thus one point ginger imagines herself " force nature " ; but minutes later , her sensuous beauty takes grotesque turn , pathetically she asks her sister brigitte " what am i ? " contrast , keynote " dog soldiers " exhilaration -- joy battle , however futile battle may seem . despite apparent differences tone , both movies converge masterpieces nightmarish vision -- wonderfully crafted , yet bristling expressive energy ; respect , fierce emotional interplay charismatic ginger more withdrawn , sensitive brigitte simply unequaled . horror just doesn't come more convincing or compelling shape than " ginger snaps .

" mississippi mermaid " early francois truffaut film , if it looks familiar -- it may you've seen " original sin " -- angelina jolie/antonio banderas remake film . louis mahe ( jean-paul belmondo ) plays wealthy factory owner who lives small island , reunion , near africa . beginning film , louis eagerly expecting arrival his mail-order bride . photo hand , he impatiently waits her arrive , when he confronted julie roussel ( catherine deneuve ) who not woman photo , he happily swallows story she sent him photo someone else -- after all , they both engaged minor deceits during their courtship mail , so he overlooks warning signals marries her anyway . soon , louis becomes suspicious his new bride real identity , but he continues elect acceptance . however , when he receives letter julie sister demanding know why she hasn't heard julie , he forced confront julie . julie promptly cleans out joint bank account disappears ... i never fan jean-paul belmondo . however , this film , his facial expressions extremely impressive , i began see perhaps i overlooked him past . catherine deneuve plays chilling julie roussel/marion vergano . beginning film , deneuve plays demure julie , but when persona julie dumped , deneuve assumes identity marion , ice queen emerges . whereas angelina played julie/marion role sizzling passion , deneuve icy , controlling evil . however , this precise reason it difficult understand why mahe continued adore julie/marion . partnership hell theory just doesn't hold on-screen relationship mahe marion -- there wasn't enough sexual chemistry explain it . perhaps it can't helped given age film , but denueve manage two topless scenes -- one which almost causes car acciden t.t he film dated . airplane travel scenes tedious . when it time action , camera just speeds up , effect preposterous . however , " mississippi mermaid " well worth look if you die-hard fan either french cinema or catherine deneuve -- displacedhuma	-1

mccabe mrs. miller often talked one list director robert altman seventies films takes cinematic genre ( namely western ) subverts it point making it seem like attack its cinematic precedents . traditional western gung-ho heroism nowhere evidence , it seems , mccabe mere parody hero director invites audience laugh . if this case , than mccabe mrs. miller would , best , looked upon satirical look-back cinematic tastes fifties . self-congratulatory " how far we've come ... " negation western romance favour neo-realist version west populated cast ambiguous charaters anything but heroic . if altman " long goodbye " transported hopelessly out-of-date phillip marlowe into californian seventies than " mccabe mrs. miller " inverts this transposes typically indecisive modern man(californian or otherwise ) into context mythical west . but this both " mccabe mrs. miller " it western precedents disservice . film works best not suberversion genre , which end just satire , but subervsion or , more correctly , deconstruction myth ( regardless individual singular genre ) which much grander . if elements subverting western seem implicit this than it true point pre-conceived notions archetypal western hero would ignoring moral complexities john wayne character " searchers " or william holden " wild bunch " , name couple.at outset , we presented figure mccabe , newly entered into presbyterian church society . brash , intent playing cards buying rounds , impression bravura western confidence we solidified circulating rumour his killing man days gone . skip film end our initial impressions justified . myth confirmed flourished ready continue.it movie middle acts where myth subverted . warren beatty exceptional indecisive businessman whose assertiveness whittled away scene . not any western since " johnny guitar " female taken such authoritive role julie christy here . she decidedly dominant partner , both their business their relationship . decidedly , this subversion but it film focus business relationships which ultimately makes it more . when it comes point where character asserts mccabe never killed man , audience accord . yet , myth comes . it all stronger more romantic its rooted work-a-day realities . this , it much comment art it western little ultra-realism . there myth its own making myth altman vilmos zsigmond stunning cinematography realize this beautifully here .

shakespeare much ado nothing my first shakespeare play , read or studied , no means i disappointed . i enjoyed humor , mistaken identities , sense foolishness love . shakespeare comedy although written several years ago still proves relevant today . his use love crazy things people find it , once found keep it , always prove timeless message . shakespeare mainly communicates how foolish deliberate people act when they find themselves love . title also elaborates fact people spend entirely too much time worrying nothing . characters become enthralled present ignore future reality their circumstances . many characters also develop sense selfishness when asked choose themselves or any one else . later story we see benedick choose love over himself his characters changes softens through his own confused heart . character don john tries stir up trouble soon married claudio hero . through cleverly thought out mistaken identity infatuated pair soon dwindle public disgrace , only found innocent end . after this action occurred beatrice tells benedick she would like see his friend claudio dead what he her cousin . benedick chooses women he loves over friend he knows . although benedick not kill claudio he still made this agreement his heart betray him . amusing aspect play constant changing relationship beatrice benedick . we first find them deeply involved their continuous war words . soon these two bickering characters find love through fight through constant misunderstanding these characters display hopeful love one . however , reader left questioning whether or not this love true . one my favorite scenes takes place orchard when claudio , don pedro , leonato plan trick attentively listening benedick . knowing he only feet away , behind bushes , shakespeare writing pokes fun his feelings future desires beatrice . i love humor way their one conversation alters benedick choices . important comic relief character would dogsberry his trusty assistant verges . usage malapropism adds humor story it message unable matched any other character . shakespeare making point characters this story illustrating their obsession hear now instead looking grand picture their situations . he showing his readers not take life or your relationships too seriously . aspect this play posed point went equally previous lesson crazy things people love . characters this story often would just pick up anything person they felt they loved ., flip side would just quickly forget person . example these actions when claudio hero their misunderstanding claudio shamed her front their town what he understood betrayal . immediacy actions urgency reason all often compromised characters their emotions . much ado nothing refreshing comedy light , but also significant meaning . shakespeare truly captures mind humans seeking love crazy world . play proves relevant although language may different story not unlike our society today . i would absolutely recommend this play anyone looking watch humorous love story unfold before them . i very much enjoyed reading shakespeare cleverly envelops his reader into story crazy characters their crazier reactions love misunderstandings . i so much fun watching this play performed seeing genius unfold shakespeare intended us all see . this play not soon nor easily forgotten generations come . i'm so happy opened its cover now hold it my bookshelf .	1
i am generous giving this film two stars . i saw trailer it , while it looked intriguing , looks deceiving , much like bulk this would-be psychological potboiler . i think photography work acting deserve minimum two stars both excellent ; general storyline , however , drivel . many reviewers noted how film fundamentally makes no sense , there parts where i agree wholeheartedly . i don't mind thought-provoking films leave you wondering what actually happened , but this mostly shallow end standpoint plot construction . it inconceivable me how two female leads ( charlotte rampling , ludivine sagnier ) could tolerate one ; further , it incomprehensible why rampling didn't merely leave france when sagnier started making her life miserable . believe rampling would actually help sagnier conceal murder impossible . yes , i know entire character daughter ambiguous end , but inasmuch character constructed rampling mind murderess negates charges cinematic intellectual superiority holds rampling judgment suspec t.t he entire movie filled characters excruciating watch , only real reason two star rating actors outstanding job their roles . i considered briefly watching film second time make sure i understood all nuances , but i just hated it too much first time give it second chance . this one film looks positively great two minute theatrical trailer , but looks positively awful light day hulking 103 minute feature . i am very open-minded unusual , imported , avant-garde films , but while this movie touches all three , i merely relieved when it over .	-1

matthew bourne version nutcracker storyline begins victorian orphanage , where dr. dross ( drosselmeyer traditional version ) his wife portrayed pompous meanies who intimidate kids . further contrasting original , dross children ungrateful , spoiled brats , act true form during their visit orphanage . governors arrive inspect ward , but there more bickering than revelry , presents they've brought children get taken away soon " festivity " ( read commotion ) over . come bedtime , clara dreams nutcracker doll ( who dead ringer puppet howdy doody show ; hilarious ! ) comes life , breaks apart walls orphanage , whisks her away snowy paradise . second act takes us " sweetieland , " where everything ( everyone , apparently ) made candy . when clara falls love nutcracker prince , love triangle (!) results when sugar plum fairy also makes overtures prince . after requisite series theme dances we're back orphanage , where clara wakes up discover her " prince " actually one boys ward . unique mix characters storyline held my attention throughout , help original tchaikovsky score enabled me keep my bearings beginning end ( i.e. , " so this music occurs when this character . . . " ) . more one familiar traditional nutcracker story , easier it make leap into mr. bourne fantasy , comparisons this original interpretations more interesting enlightening . [ i would definitely not recommend this anyone first viewing nutcracker]the dancers/actors display over-emoted gestures facial expressions , but this necessary convey much more comical spirited production ( performance filmed before live audience ) . expected , choreography also strays traditional , incorporating mix modern dance , swing , even folkloric elements . i like this lot . you see hint more traditional ballet steps , although , without pointe shoes " ballerinas " more free execute diversity movement . choreography amazingly tight , even curtain call cast taking positions cue . costumes anything but traditional , ranging dull , threadbare orphanage clothing wild , feathery , colorful ( pink dominates ) outfits sweetieland . some clever elements incorporated into mr. bourne storyline allusions movies ( " one flew over cuckoo nest " one ) some bits playful sexual innuendo-sweetieland characters licking each other well candy ( children likely remain unaffected ) . also , ending dance suite involves many highly self-absorbed personas who , when not watching themselves mirrors , seem playing out game one-upmanship dance dance . very fun watch . sound quality fantastic : clear , bright , well balanced . camera work made excellent use both traditional oblique-angle perspectives , but many instances image framing where performers cut off waist ( my pet peeve ) , thus depriving viewer some excellent footwork body language . run time 80+ minutes zipped pretty quickly , i would enjoyed seeing some scenes played out little longer . still , it good show , i'd recommend this performance anyone but firs t-t ime nutcracker viewers or ballet traditionalists	-1
i started watch eternal " sunshine spotless mind " , after first 15 minutes i realized i could not turn it off drive work ( which i supposed ) . i what jim kerry character joel - i called my boss left her message i would late . i stayed home i watched film . i cried , i laughed , i sighed , i felt - i lived through it . there not so many films we don't just watch but live through - me , esotsm . finally , charlie kaufman film i absolutely love . " john malkovich " amused me ; " adaptation " irritated me - too much charlie there my taste even if he looked like nic cage . " eternal sunshine ... " kaufman masterpiece relationships , memories , reality , intolerance , impatience , inability listen others , understand them . how easy it insult one you love most . how difficult it forgive yourself . how often we rely modern technology fix our inner problems . how seldom we realize painful happy memories go together . you not get rid ones keep others . it may not best romance film ever but it damn close . it tender poignant valentine card kaufman sent all us - remind us love exists , relationships survive , even if they die , we memories them , nobody or nothing take our memories us . it just coincidence kaufman references second time tragic great love eloisa abelard his works ? i applaud michel gondry his brilliant directing ; supporting cast , including tom wilkinson , mark ruffalo , kirsten dunst . jim carrey kate winslet played their best roles ever i hope see carrey more often dramatic performances . but beginning everything there word - without kaufman screenplay film would not happened . thank you , charlie .	1

fan zombie movies someone who enjoyed city living dead zombie , i very disappointed house cemetery . fulci manages create good mystery first two-thirds movie , only squander it some poorly executed scare scenes . house cemetery researcher ( whose work never specified ) who moves his wife his kid into house massachussets order finish out work colleague who killed himself his mistress . titular house only place they really find moment , so dr. boyle , his wife lucy their son bob move despite lot bad signs , like boarded-up door cellar tombstone dr. jacob tess freudstein front hall . bob little red-headed girl friend who keeps warning him how bad house ( though no one else sees her ) . furthermore , people keep claiming dr. boyle town before non-existent daughter ( which he denies , not totally convincingly ) . he also seems some secret relationship babysitter , anne , who starts unboarding cellar door middle night . lucy seems either recovering or suffering serious psychological issues . got ? good , because half stuff never gets explained . only things get worked out little red-headed girl identity identity killer ( neither which hard figure out ) . there some nice visual moments earlier parts film ( fact killer one normal hand one rotting hand , photograph changes each viewing , mannequin gets beheaded starts bleeding ) but fulci ability handle gore moments disappoints . he lingers too long over some deaths , makes killer so ridiculously slow snail could outrun him bits like babysitter head falling down stairs come off funny rather than scary . compared injury eye scene zombie or christopher george chopping through coffin cotld , dr. boyle chopping through door around his son head feels like self-parody . fulci other films incoherent plots , but rarely way seems work against plot ( dream-like nature city living dead seems appropriate given prophetic dream heroine gets mystical nature threat ) execution setpieces usually fantastic . house cemetery neither thing working its favor . it not hell living dead-level bad , but fact it some genuinely good acting ( especially paolo malco , who plays dr. boyle ) interesting set-up almost make flaws worse . also , this version " never before seen deleted scene " , but it no sound just extended reaction shot after bat attack	-1
there seems several films regarding this one . story corruption property deals , story fathers their children , tentative romeo juliet romance course martial arts guns . those who like cross-culture , " romeo must die " , you ! jet li who fresh " lethal weapon 4 " really delivers this action-packed movie . playing han big one him . aaliyah(1979-2001 ) , rb sensation really got her acting chops gear playing alluring trish o'day , who shadowed bumbling maurice , played funny , anthony anderson , but i personally would hoped more michael wong less anthony anderson ( his constant ' dim sum ' refrain quite irritating ) but actors act , plot moves film enjoyable enough . i'd enjoyed x-ray effects movie whenever fight going happen . i liked part when han refused fight woman , he used trish fight her . it looked more swing dance me . since trish words backed him up , enemy impaled through heart . after final fight , trish father ( delroy lindo ) , wanted meet han himself , i ' glad he got chance , i think it silly him demand handshake him , but hey , he wanted who " cat " , make sure he . han never declined any offer only know who troublemaker behind " war " . before anyone remember seeing aaliyah " queen damned " ( which i personal dislike ) , look into this film first . i love jet li , but this film not good ' kiss dragon ' but better than ' one ' ' cradle 2 grave ' but inferior jet li hong kong movies .	-1

i liked this movie lot better first time i saw it ...... when it called " star wars " . i really liked scene where eragon looking off into sunset . boy , how original . i haven't read eldest , but i'm assuming princess eragon sister . this correct ? i wondering when han solo going show up , then course he . i also like scene where eragon take detour go cloud city rescue princess . then she tells him its trap . i expecting villian say , " magic strong you , eragon , but you're not dragon rider yet . " i hear writer only 16 when he wrote this . big deal . lot aspiring novelists writing stuff 16 . it never gets published reason . their brains not fully developed , they don't enough life experience absorb their influences reshape them into something original . i think this definately case here . mozart wrote his first symphony 5 years old . we never hear one , though , we ? way , aragon one main characters lord rings . its like this kid isn't even trying original . changing first letter , but leaving name phonetically identical not original	-1

i my little pony fan since they first came out 80 . i collecting newest generation ponies mlp-themed merchandise add my old collection . i all cartoons movies so far g3 , first few quite corny imho , but they got progressively better . princess promenade good story line kept even me ( 26-year-old woman lol ) interested see what happens next . animation quality well-done ( except expected little mistakes here there ) songs not annoying like most other cartoon singing , characters very likeable . only thing still lacking g3 movies some kind enemy . my favorite episodes 80 pilot special which very well-done bad guys while still not ' violent ' . i think adding few darker characters would add alot contrast interest storylines . one thing disappointed me princess promenade ' spike dragon ' . i remember spike 80 cute , scruffy-voiced baby dragon such great character him . i not like way he drawn this film , or his ' proper ' personality . i miss good ol ' 80s spike . so why i gave it 4 instead 5- spike favorite character mine old cartoons , it upsetting see how they changed him . but it still great film , those who new mlp wont notice or care change . previous g3 film ' very minty christmas ' also very cute , so check out well . i look forward next film when we finally unicorns- especially since probably means there'll unicorn mlp toys released well !	-1
actually paid good money see this local cinema ! went good friend who real fan stokers novel , before i even got say word she already asked , " what hell we just watch , because it wasn`t dracula !

world war ii , channel islands taken over nazis people who'd lived island before then pretty much left their own devices . they didn't military protection because it wasn't priority send forces protect one island . inhabitants basically two choices : stay or go ( evacuate ) . series open , you see families faced reality these tough decisions . some ( most ) send their children away " put up " other families . some adults leave well , including jewish shopowners who simply hand over their keys trusted friends who remain behind island . some cases , husbands wives separated there other scenes parents standing dock , watching their children hauled off what seem very small boats ( my heart my throat watching those scenes ) . i found all this fascinating , relating wholly dilemna families who stay or go , deal indignity taken over country - or pain leaving it all behind , not knowing if when you'd see your home again or what would left when you returned . all this builds up actual occupation island , which starts out bloody massacre docks , planes flying overhead strafing innocent people then ... strange calm after ( awhile anyway ) . there forced politeness german officers met political officials island but animosity mistrust both sides clear . things move fairly slowly after germans arrive , building tension bit bit . alliances formed some germans families but , other cases , divisions cause painful repercussions . movie focuses primarily few families this allows close-up view what they may encountered . one couple strained marriage tensions rachet up during occupation -but they also , times , see each other new eyes . mostly , though , this film reveals how " fuzzy " things truly become during war , how morality twisted values changed ... or how some people rise occasion become better . there isn't false note this one . my only quibble ( it minor ) some parts seemed overly long , some dry spells events . but overall this movie fascinating i learned something part history which i really knew very little . i'm grateful i got opportunity so .	-1

both sets reviewed many times so i am making mine short point . vol . i ii both thematic ( i . deals places -- famous world cities ) ii ( best ) involves events . best two entries " circus " shows chan first time his large family 12 ( it grew 14 later series ) deals murder very unpopular circus owner . " cc olympics " amazing piece work . #1 son ( great keye luke ) contender nazi occupied berlin olympics . this premise it own ( even it great subplot ) makes this one best oland series . none chan francishe films ran more than hour ( 70 minutes top ) , so both sets containing 4 discs quite expensive ( although fox reputed spent $ 2,000,000 restoration ) . round out set sidney toler wwii outings released mgm -- chantology ( which far cautious due times -- series moved studio monogram ) . if you real fan , then all three pricey sets worth investment . i tried buy them used lesser price . beware ! once you start watching series ( unfortunately many finer outings lost their copyright only available poorly made homemade bootleg dvd-rs ) , you get hooked most famous oriental detective ( based real life honolulu detective ) all time , amazing charlie chan . great series best genre .	1
i don't usually spend money dvds , but i love first six seasons this show . sci-fi channel regularly plays re-runs , but when price season 1 dvds dropped $15 , i couldn't pass it up . special price may something quality dvds . one episode , you can't hear anything apophis says , two other episodes skip alot . despite flaws dvds , i still gave this 4 stars . it great tv show i am very happy i one season dvd play anytime i want . i'll watching see if prices other sets drop , too	-1
let me make this very clear . i am not woody allen fan all , but i love this movie . humor , music , acting ... everything this movie first rate . it made me nostalgic time i didn't even live through - that how effective this film taking you back era radio . oh , i also don't usually like films led child actors ( " home alone " , shudders ) , but seth green ( who 12 or 13 years old when this made ) phenomenal . so , even if you , like me , don't much care woody allen films , give this one try anyway . i think you'll very pleasantly surprised	1
movie suggested lytton strachey fine essay gordon appeared his classic eminent victorians , indeed story brewing long time before combination international interests unleashed khartoum english speaking world . it time when olivier , newly remarried surprised father young family , desperate money wouild snatch up any job , so film world brightened , if that word , olivier appearing any old movie if they gave him enough lucre . it if he saying , i repertory thing thirty years , it time payoff . thus we got extra helpings ham bunny lake missing , shoes fisherman , battle britain , really any old blockbuster . it rare 60s movie didn't room olivier it . he never good any them , but khartoum his performance mahdi causes enough offense nearly justify , years later , recent subway bombings london . russet makeup smeared over his face ( slightly different shade than blackface he used othello ) , olivier bites every piece scenery known man , playing rhe mahdi mad tyrannical prophet islam , like westerners fantasy al qaeda , hollering white men blood letting his strange fantasies allah cloud his limited intellect . next him , gordon ( charlton heston ) almost looks like sane man . maybe filmmakers making some sort antiwar statement . this distance it hard say . what we see pretty frightening , there over top then there over top mahdi	-1

fan mme . austen , thomas hardy , d.h. lawrence other sundry novelists manner , i freely admit hopeless addiction " period " pieces -- romances , particular -- this weakness clearly plays into very generous aforementioned 2-star rating . " northanger abbey " charming bit camp rainy afternoon , but please don't expect this movie anything like big-money hollywood adaptations mme . austen other works . acting over-the-top ; soundtrack , deplorable ; characters ( exception eleanor ) completely unsympathetic . catherine portrayed insipid half-wit , rather than day-dreamy post-adolescent verge womanhood . peter firth henry tilney vascilates compassionate , brotherly concern annoyingly superior arrogance . end movie , i lost all patience them convinced henry catherine fully deserve misery they inevitably wreak upon each other . ( this romance buff ! ) most give up before end film , but true austen fans enjoy parade costumes , witty repartee , opportunity daydream regency culture . watch it or don't -- but if you choose watch , make sure you so sense humor forebearance .	-1
gah . judging earlier descriptions this box , i thought it'd uncut billingual like other 4kids dvds . it not case , so no dice	-1

i saw shorter/santana this tour , still t-shirt prove it . it awe-inspiring moment music history . santana doing his brand jazz-rock fusion since ' 70 , but taken detour into pop world . santana " lotus " " caravanserai " masterpieces , not mention carlos ' work alice coltrane . reviewer quite obviously not his homework , leon " ndugu " chancler worked santana 1974-1976 , * before * joining weather report ( chancler weather report 1975 ) . santana friends wayne shorter many years , recorded " swing delight " shorter 1980 , which may bit ambitious fell fairly short their potential . however , any professional music reviewer truly believes drummer chester thompson switched keyboards this tour bumbling idiot . chester thompson , keyboard player , playing santana since 1983 , well * major * name hammond organ players , main keyboard player tower power 10 years . chester thompson , drummer , played weather report one year , 1976 , but long-time touring drummer genesis . he great drummer , but he'll never keyboard player level his namesake santana band . this tour amazing feat , while shorter much richer history jazz-rock world than santana , their playing seemed perfect complement each other . i eagerly await next time carlos decides take such risk leave comfortable pop world explore jazz textures shorter . santana also performed kickin ' version miles davis ' " silent way/it time " , which former written future weather report keyboardist/leader joe zawinul . weather report/shorter connection goes much further back much stronger than our friend sam would us believe .	1

i , like so many its fans , cannot understand what minds critics time who bashed this film . no , it certainly not quiet man , thank god . ireland reflected ryan daughter not your quaint , leprechan-filled stereotypical place beloved world doesn't know much real ireland . atmosphere this movie haunting disturbing reflective great deal irish life , particularly time revolution against british rule . attitudes narrow-minded villagers realistic line church-dominated lives they led , irish great begrudgers so their jealousy lovely daughter local publican quite believable . however , this story young woman married respectable kindly older man but yearning romantic love takes greater significance when it addresses deeper issues involved : retribution , redemption , forgiveness , betrayal loyalty . love scenes sara miles christopher jones , playing shell-shocked british soldier who arouses desire she kept under wraps , some most intense moving i've seen . when they become enmeshed village suspicions , prejudices hatred english , all set against backdrop brooding rather sinister irish countryside , tragedy set place . this riveting film filled outstanding performances , beautiful scenery universal themes . robert mitchum particular outstanding what may his best ever performance , one very much against type . , course , there ever-present star show , ireland , incredibly beautiful land saints scholars , informers patriots , martyrs conspirators . this film add your collection .	1
this movie made back 1975 where it seems everybody jumping one person bed . plot pretty thin . this guy entrusts warren ( without soft focus lens dick tracey ) look after his girfriend . warren plays hairdresser so this guy makes incorrect assumptions warren sexual orientation . i think this movie would made better documentary warren sex life however i give it 5 stars some reason which i can't quite think right now because it 110 degrees outside here hot australian summer which kind fries my fragile little brain	1

idea behind story well acting three main characters both overcome actual plot this movie . it recieved higher grade then i would given it because acting , i almost wished i could seen it pre 9/11 well post 9/11 , just see how i would react differently . last night first time i've seen seige , it surprising . maybe not great , but surprising . i think what got me most how terrorists didn't care their lives , just they don't over iraq . long message clear word got out , they continue doing what they doing until message listened . movie , it amazing see hollywood depiction chaos would ensue after such act . especially since this before real incident happened just same way.at parts , i wishing less unnecessary plot points , well some them come together better , but whole , seige it job .	-1
this movie just bit fun ! acting , directing production values very good . maxwell caulfield makes excellent reluctant hero john rhys davies injects humor into his villanous role . medieval setting more convincing less glamorous than many movies i've seen . script pretty good , dragon eggs land like comets earth , but we aren't sure first ( neither characters ) what they . even though movie not bloodfest , it too scary children . dragons kill people , there fair amount suspense , dragons frightening	1

this nostalgic bit filmmaking 80s . sights sounds inimitably 80s . however , this sort enigmatic film . much it part 80s it seemed lack chic timeliness those days . i don't know why but david caruso one actor who i remember indelibly connected it . every time i think this film all i remember caruso screen presence even though he minor yet disquieting character . steven bauer very good gives heartfelt performance . barbara williams seemed rather detached added obscure feeling this film john getz performance well . bauer , williams getz remain no more than shadowy figures upon recollection , while production design , cinematography story remain imbedded psyche . story interesting disturbing same time i wonder who really thief hearts this tale giving film ultimate conclusion . i think douglas day stewart directed only one other motion picture he primarily screenwriter . film ambiguous style seems bolsters fact . film very provocative mix sensuality , sexual repression seems represents era when introverted self gratification glossy lifestyles replace traditional intimate values otherwise loved ones . interestingly , this film seems strange allure it leaving indelible impression once viewed .	-1
many thanks reviews here . whear , arlan ebel , mickey moose 15 . this amazon reviewing its best . read those three their entireties . what stands out me after watching this movie seductive wholesome portrayal santa rosa . time also given this film nostalgic value , deepening american romance small-town life . details all work make us feel comfortable this town , down traffic cop who knows names whereabouts everyone who lives his town , severe but helpful librarian , lovely white house its big porch lawns , dinner scenes where all ( girl ) children help their mother serve mashed potatoes . further we move time this movie , more powerful its image innocence becomes . contribution co-writer thornton wilder ( our town ) very evident here . perfection location makes arrival uncle charley ( played brilliantly joseph cotten ) all more ominous . ominous what this movie really good . outside santa rosa all confusion , shown when panicky young charlie unable locate her rescuer ( detective jack graham ) any addresses he left her . ties santa rosa rest america remain tenuous . end , battle good evil seem get resolved , but allusion " crazy world " outside santa rosa last scene , reminds us this resolution not meant felt final . there " ghost world " outside comfort santa rosa its physical double , just uncle charley shadows young charlie . it world where film significantly begins even if it not where it ends . sum , beautiful white house both front stairs back one . it hard forget seeing shadowy figure uncle charley through window those back stairs , which also become young charlie preferred way ; it because he knows she use them her uncle almost able kill her those stairs	1

this second installment cartoon network halloween dvd . it got halloween-themed episode kids next door double dose courage . personally , besides franken-bravo episode , i thought they'd put second episode billy mandy there . maybe next volume . thing , i thought i am weasel episode would either " i am franken-weasel " and/or " i ghost " follow up " i am vampire " episode first volume . but dvd title " grossest halloween ever " , " power odor " seem fit it . goes same powerpuff girls episode entitled " reeking havoc " (i expecting episode where girls battle zombie magician ) . like i said before : maybe next volume . perhaps volume three , i noticed halloween-themed episode billy mandy one cow chicken . plus , some other scary-looking episodes other cartoon network shows like ed-isode where single-d masquerades monster terrorizes neighborhood , or time when dexter watches scary movie experience horrifying effects watching it , or one where kids next door fight some zombie nerds . , hey , there brand new ed , edd eddy halloween special called eds ' " boo haw haw .

we bought season one our daughter when she three she absolutely loved all episodes . i searched searched second season but kept getting reports sony would not release second season . i am ecstatic they finally . previous reviewer wrote , this not princess promenade . these saturday morning cartoons form 80 when thundarr he-man very popular . yes there monsters , yes ponies often " mortal " danger . yes , animation not crisp like todays computer drawn animation , but all episodes wonderful show kids if you good person stand your friends , good things happen you . this something many thin skinned , terrified children today should learn instead coddled mindless entertainment like dora or blue . off topic , sorry , back discs . songs simple catchy , our daughter 4 1/2 now sings most songs season one . she hasn't learned season two yet , but it only matter time . i would highly recommend this all children love play little ponies	1

i live el centro , winter training grounds blue angels . i watched them train january through march good many years . people who buy this dvd probably expecting see 45 minutes air show . instead , you hear mumbling narrative john travolta which very much history naval aviation , too little flying . lead pilot , or " boss " assigned pentagon , this video not point out " boss " this team removed because safety violations . other pilots didn't want fly him . best blue angels video i seen " blue angels : xtreme close-up " which aired military channel . it pure flying . if you want lots air show mixed interesting behind scenes then i recommend " blue angels : year life " . just don't buy this one unless you want fall asleep .	-1

i took this movie very personally , found beginning tedious , middle painful ending joyous . i keep this movie . every actor it ( it quite line-up pros ) outstanding . fortunately none reviews ( i read ) gave away ending or much plot . reviews . houseman more than one scene many more than dozen lines . camera work good enough ( i don't know enough movies tell good bad ) i suppose , i found it little labored , stunned triteness seeing shots women feet when one hurrying follow other . unlike review , i feel life-changing event occurred things going decidedly different , better both protagonist others . unlike heroine , i'm turning 60 , not 50 , i not see 50 old . but heroine said , 30 , 40 , 50 - she told expect overwhelmed each these birthdays " traumatized " turning 50 . woman said despite these warnings , she unphased each birthday until she hit 50 , traumatize her . i don't remember how i felt turning 50 , but not much i don't think , nor much any other ages . but sigh turning 60 me down count . i'm just taking up violin . thing i tried doing few months college many years ago , but gave up . now it " too late " anything more than hobby , i feel greatly motivated . enough . i doubt it make you want watch picture . i recommend this movie without reservations . allen protagonist split infinitive one early scenes . but rest his grammar good this flick . pleasant change	1

i really took ' very bad things ' when it came out ' 98 , i watched it other day friend ( not seen it since its run theatres ) , i found i still esteemed crazed entity unique fervor . i think what most commendable ' very bad things ' , least person like myself , this actor peter berg directorial debut . not its technical virtues , which it possess , but because berg created picture such grim ferocity , holding back so little , most dangerously , entering directing world product , its neccessity , going receive near unanimous criticism its " distaste " . here thing ... despite sensationalistic way film approaches most horrific circumstances , i find ' very bad things ' almost brings within me sense empathy because , all all , five main characters film -- group old friends -- not bad people . seriously -- how many groups genuinely decent guys take vegas buddies ' bachelor party ? furthermore , they inherently despicable because they're getting loaded , snorting cocaine , generally acting like crazed little boys night event ? oh , but one them pounding prostitute -- if none other characteristics qualify making someone evil , surely this one must . well , not me . large , these guys appear likable middle class schmucks , stuck so many within half-baked life . where many find them unlikable without hesitation , i empathize because they all flawed ; once favreau soon-to-be wife introduced ( played bitingly diaz ) , it hard view him much more than pathetic noodle , completely subserviant witch behind beauty . then you've got piven stern , playing two dichotomous brothers general disdain each other personality complex ; piven lively but lost , single apathetic towards his career , probably acting bit younger than he should , while stern , contrast , responsible but neurotic ; uptight family man who no easier respect given his life accomplishments anal behaviorisms . leland orser reclusive , enigma shy guy doesn't offer much look up , christian slater demented complex made up handful self-help books easily most pathetic five . basically , these guys all normal some senses but completely deprived others , before night begins their descenting journey into madness , none them , my eye , could judged despicable any justification ( okay , so maybe slater could , judging real estate selling scene ) . film fateful climax , i pretty fond entire group . so , then , you've got premise , my mind ; awful accident occurs hotel room vegas , prostitute no longer living . thing , it wasn't anyone fault , unless you seriously blame piven act ( if prostitute wasn't responsible taking part circus act ); simply devestating accident . yet , because nature how system tends work , accident could still prove bring down more lives consequence . perhaps if they weren't all coked up , their decision making abilities might steered them better direction . nope -- they high kite , scared abandoned baby . essentially , point we see them make one mistake after , usually out survival instinct , no means rendered act . so ensues suffering paranoia all , reaching snowball effect until film finishes . if you ask me , if these guys weren't relatable or capable likelihood , film wouldn't last beyond intial moment chaotic hysteria ... but it . throughout most it , film expresses nice emphasis exaggeration , lends some comedy dire consequences proceed . but , many said before me , ' very bad things ' doesn't really seem like comedy . slater character , his outrageous justifications their nasty acts , comes highpoint exaggerated comedy . yet , it surely no drama , sense melodrama least . rather , it just detatched , furious account bizzarely interesting but fatal situations , up ' till this point , people who've never encountered such fearful , life-altering experiences . combined berg energetic direction , overall , impressive , convincing , intense performances -- wavering seriousness comedic ( my favorites piven , stern , orser diaz ' ) -- whole thing just ashamedly entertaining . it just . what else i say ? i think highly moral people might shun film , but anyone knack fatalism oughta really dig ' very bad things ' . abuser only abuses because he abused . while this might seen cowardly , i think we all , least secretly , view many things such angle , especially if events such hit us or those close us . indeed , we all whim great magnet who , this case , just happened cause asian hooker slip wet bathroom floor , letting her head gracefully plow through towel hanger wall . it dark it twisted . it ugly , sure . i myself no issues people disliking it , least claim not judge them it . i just hope those who fact repulsed least attempt understand why some may like it , not judge them unrelenting way many seem judge film , which sometimes seems near likes possessed demon	-1

i really wanted like " third man out " more than i . it all makings fine movie , but i felt it little forced , little scattered , story didn't hold up terribly well . i am happy say " shock " really fine movie vast improvement over " system . " it preserves continuity strachey character , we get new murder mystery , tons more back story , much more natural-feeling , interesting , thoughtful feel relationship strachey his partner . some chuckles inside jokes , there real feeling here , this film takes some chances . it deals coming out , self-identity , parenting , more . mr. strachey investigation takes him inside gay conversion group , or " ex-gay " group , film thoughtful deals respectfully all characters . course chad allen best part this movie , seems born , almost , role which he pulls off , somehow , conveying feelings emotions barely perceptible change expression . this film worth seeing , enjoying , thinking . i look forward next installment allen/stratchey series	-1

ben bolt capable director , here he good job - everything but his lead actor . music wonderful , just enough make your spine tingle . problem here jodhi may . she turns endlessly one-note performance . she seems focussing so hard not ever blinking , while her mouth perpetually agape . mr bolt must blame this , because she certainly seems decent actor . nonetheless , her performance drags this interesting production down into realm cartoon . unfortunate , children housekeeper - ghosts - solid supporting cast . script also awkward times clumsy . i suspect other reviewer correct ideally wanting hear this story read firelight - either 100 years ago , or perhaps tonight	-1

" sopranos " may most critically acclaimed tv series all time , but it surely features one largest , most complex cast characters ever assembled small screen . thanks those characters , season 2 grabs hold you very first scene first episode doesn't let go thirteen hilarious , violent , sad episodes . story continues revolve around massive shoulders belly tony soprano . end season 1 , tony survived " hit " arranged his uncle junior his mother , livia . but family family , both uncle junior livia still breathing outset season 2 , even though tony keeps insisting livia " dead me .

i've after this movie while , but put off , people telling me it no good , various bad reviews i've read etc . after bad day work , i found it very reasonable price , nabbed it . i'm glad i now , surprised when i didn't get yelled buying it :) this film very strange , very ott storyline , not much it makes sense person who only bought film see her favourite actress angelina . i quite shocked start it discover , wee geeky guy girl next door , paul dano . ( who quite nice looking guy when he takes his glasses off . ) film starts him befriending guy , then pushing him front truck . it snowballs there . what puzzled me most this film , lack decent characters it . ok , angelina fabulous ever , actually suited her character , someone who kinda psychic , see what happened dead people etc . oliver martinez ethan hawke horribly miscast , just plain horrible too . i just don't find french accents sexy ( despite fact most time he very little say film ) , it just me , or anyone else find ethan hawke very rat-like ? charming image i know . kiefer sutherland i thought suited role he , i've only previously seen his blink-and-you'll-miss-him role phone booth , he comes across kinda guy - suitably creepy . ( haven't seen 24 . ) angelina gets her kit off this film , so if you want good look nearly everything , then guys , you'd better get this film . i dread think how long she spend makeup this scene , cover up her numerous tattoos she . some say finale this film let down , honest , i didn't think so . oh my god !!! finale your face , totally unexpected , i couldn't believe what happening . it made up certain other points movie lacking , although i jump out my seat least 3 times , screamed cos there some scenes where you get such frigh t.t his basically must-see any angelina fans . she plays marvellous part this , i actually enjoy film , definitely watch it again	-1
a.i. one those movies caused much divide viewers ' opinions , many varied reasons . it certainly movie multilayered seen many levels . me , a.i. holds special place my heart . it masterpiece ranks alongside those movies experienced rather than watched lingers long time ( it still after many years ) . it hauntingly beautiful one power touch emotional resonance what makes you truly human . like shawshank redemption ( one my other favourite films ) evokes power friendship , hope redemption ; a.i. evokes power dreams , love reunion . both films utilize universal theme possibilities completion through journey life . , i am sure , like other viewers suggested , this film revisited again sometime future seen different ligh t.t he acting excellent , especially haley joel osment david also jude law gigolo joe . also worth praising this film musical score john williams . me , it confirms him greatest movie score composer history . main theme soprano hauntingly ethereal , both sorrowful soothing same time . piano score like lullaby evokes memories childhood innocence purity . ** warning : spoilers here if you not watched movie !! **the movie android boy who programmed ( his little silicon soul ? ) goal love his human parents ( this particular case , his mother ) , simply , loved return . that all . but , unexpected happens when their once incurable human son cured returns them so effectively causes his mother , monica , abandon android robot . so , this where real journey begins : level abandonment , loneliness absence love . android boy , david , begins his quest return motherly love again but travel through dangerous world search clues fulfill his grandest wish . many viewers suggested this film too long final 3rd movie should cut , so david never realises his dream loved his mother . but , my opinion , missing whole point this movie . david programmed goal love loved his mother . his `program ' reason his existence . human terms , it this heartfelt dream love gave him meaning living , only following his dream would it ultimately bring him home happiness peace . it david unwavering faith eventually fulfilled his dream ( complete his program ) , course , helping some advanced mechas . 3rd act , me , completes cycle life ; not just a-to-b ending ends bleakly without meaning . if you cynic , materialist , believe stories metaphor no real meaning , love no power striving dreams no value , then pre-3rd act best where you leave this movie . me , 3rd act moves beyond limitations physical level onto philosophical , metaphorical spiritual level . david gifted temporary resurrection monica so he complete his goal . how ironic ! first , humans play god create machines . machine gradually becomes more human . humans regress become more like machines/or animals . then finally , advanced machines play god recreate humans ! david not only finally fulfills his mission loving loved his mother , he also , through journey life begins android/machine evolves into what it means human : through abandonment , loss love , hope reunion , unwavering strive one dreams faith no matter what impossible `physical limitations ' against you . love lost but regained one most blissful experiences humans this what david eventually experiences . it his emotional experiences relationships humans transforms him . very act loving loved return makes him human . he realizes truth told her end : he `always loved ' . time space ( even 2000 years ) no power over his dream love loved . although initially seemingly futile , reality it only temporary barrier proved completion his goal , he finally able what machine cannot : dream . transformation machine human finally transcending condition finally reach ultimate truth , me , what this film . again , how ironic it it takes `machine ' teach us what it means `human ' . end , david returns home `where dreams born ' ... realm eternal , spirit soul ? it bitter-sweet ending . bitter physical ; sweet metaphysical . way , you know `ai ' japanese actually means `love '	1

this my second favorite john woo movie great touches action drama , when i first saw this film ( 5 years ago ) i wasn't used seeing this much violence screen ( i thought lethal weapon extremely violent time ) i shock more then once my jaw dropped . this film very violent but compared other action films this really tame nowadays . minor points this film would some bad acting some worse acting some spots , some weird cuts editing , subs terrible , same audio quality some camera work bad , but this john woo first ( if you count heroes shed no tears ) landmark heroic bloodshed film so we all know he could worse much worse . yun fat chow , ti lung leslie chung their good moments bad moments , most good moments goes chow ti while leslie only one or two moments . plot like this cop must confront his criminal brother . that it . if your typical hollywood action goer this your perfect find . but i said if your new heroic bloodshed films don't make this your first one , i'll say stick killer hard boiled few weeks then move . but if your hollywood action movie goer make this your first if you handle it move other heroic bloodshed films so . this film big landmark action genre even bigger landmark underground action genre . i really recommend this film any action fan !!!!	-1
this would one worst movies i ever seen i sat through lot turkeys my lifetime . it concerns advertisng executive played kirk douglas . eddie very bad nervous breakdown following unsuccessful suicide attempt . then he procedes harrangue everybody he meets his messed up life if anybody could care less . eddie also carrying illicit affair gwen , played faye dunaway . when eddie making love his wife played deborah kerr he thinking gwen !!! i realize millions married guys all over world this but don't make it right man once said . after half hour watching this movie you get very tired eddie whining ms. dunaway makes very intelligent observation " screwing i'm getting not worth screwing i'm getting " . gee . i felt pretty screwed after hiring this piece junk video store $3.50 !!! i give this movie 5 stars because i kind like faye dunaway although she appeared better films than this one	1
one jayne mansfield last films certainly most unrestrained this outrageous sex romp ocean liner . plot , involving bed-hopping mistaken identities , served excuse her patented infamous nude scenes . this provocative , sexy , sensuos delight quite controversial back early 60 which original version banned many cities replaced much edited version . when playboy published group still shots movie including one described jayne " writhing seductively bed " issue playboy banned many cities across country . overall , this movie provocatve , sexy , sensuous delight that very well worth watching especially it original , unedited movie version !	1

don't believe negative reviews . i repeat : don't buy lukewarm responses . if you looking uninterrupted gut-busting laughter , audience laugh-track cajole you , you might better served pryor other movies or works artists like sinbad , chris rock , dave chapelle , bernie mac , george carlin others who followed his footsteps . " here now , " which roger ebert called " 90-minute documentary one man talking , " richard pryor evokes cadence relevance none above could reinvent . he rises gift genius talent savant . make no mistake , this film contains some pryor best moments . yet these moments not justice superficial label " comedy . " when pryor ties his arm off shoots up heroin , wincing intensity he stiffly pauses waiting hit materialize , then transitions into liquid shiver euphoria before his entire body falls limp -- it might disappoint those reviewers who expecting see moe , curly , larry . rest us spellbound power poetry man who comedy what jack kennedy politics ; rare achiever stifled too young not paralleled since . pryor masterful , ad-libbing sketching us roller coaster laughter , tears , pure marvel human condition . those who buy this appreciate cheap thrills rather than intellectually politically prepared moved , i say this : " you're no richard pryor .	1
i love these kind films go way beyound what we're used . monster house one my faves because it somewhat scary because it just treat watch . it actually spook factor some scary movies lacking . house alive ! owner crazy mean takes bikes balls little children who so much step blade grass it lawn . it calls little children night . house isn't afraid cops sucks whole cars into it teeth . movie also hysterical humor clean original . what starts out movie freaky house freaky owner ends up actually teaching us small life lesson we actually care animated characters . if you liked toy story then you definitely love this . this would also satisfy scary movie lover because it genuine thriller- but animation .	1

this very ... very ... very ... uh ... well ... interesting dvd . let see ... how i say this uhh ... it sucked . i'm type person who usually loves everything i watch , i love almost every genre its easy me like things . especially anime . if i say anime bad ... its pretty dang bad . this anime 2 siblings who win 2 legendary skins online game , . hack . they won skins 2 legendary characters who beat game . even though sister excited ( her skin black rose , yea , you know who i mean . hack video-gamers ) , brother ( he kite skin ) well ... isn't excited . it just pretty lame show insults amazing video games other . hack anime which masterpiece . if you really -- i mean really -- want check out this series , i reccomend manga ; it much better .	-1

these guys playing basically same songs last twenty years . but they still look like they're fun ( unlike stones other bands should retired long ago ) put great show . fleetwood buckingham best business , bar none . rendition " tusk " they give here dynamite ; i love happy faces fleetwood makes when he plays because those same faces i make when i listen him . lindsey going nuts , jumping dancing around like loon priceless . i give four stars only because this : i accidentally put disc two before disc one too lazy get up change discs . disc two just so freaking awesome disc one little disappointing . but i still watch it - just not much second part concert . i don't care if they're still touring when they're walkers . if they keep putting shows like this , i'll keep showing up . i only wish i born decade half earlier than i so i could seen them their heyday	-1
i really enjoyed this movie . let my sister borrow it she her boyfriend really loved it well	-1
now , this real anomaly : mae west starring film based successful play she wrote back 1926 . so theoretically , this film could made into silent movie , here it , turning up over 50 years later 1978 . even these more enlightened times , they didn't use original title sex , calling it sextette instead ( although opening credits put first three letters into slight relief those who might otherwise missed it ) . i'm big fan mae west , i finally let my curiosity get better me her final film , which i warned against many times . happily , i thought it delight beginning end . mae west unique history sex stars movies because she able somehow both play role sex goddess simultaneously parody same role . so while other sex queens could not gotten away doing such role this one age 85 , mae much more than " get away it , " even this age it not all parody all time . allowances made very few things . her wig one them , her slightly bizarre makeup makes her eyes seem way too far apart , her slow movements time time final one . still , she obviously taken very good care herself over years , gets show herself off one point series beautiful gowns ( keith moon over top her dress designer ) she supposedly prepares herself screen test . she clearly lot fun . film set up so she consistently deliver one-liners made her famous . these one-liners still work her , some 45 years after she used this technique her first film . ( line " girl who works paramount all day . . . " probably funniest any her one-liners . ) i sat there huge smile my face anytime mae onscreen . i would consider her inspiration those who feel after they reach certain age , it time give up . mae west just effervescent zestful here she her 1930s films . her co-stars quite good , dom deluise leading pack , followed closely ( no particular order ) tony curtis , ringo starr , george hamilton , alice cooper . i hope i forgiven thinking timothy dalton , who makes up final member sextette title not quite their league ( way , " sex " latin " six " i suspect original title more this than it " act " ) . then again dalton playing straight man all these buffoons , so his part little less showy than theirs . also , his singing voice decent although he could stand some lessons phrasing ( not breaking musical line partway through phrase ) . speaking singing , mae three numbers through course film . she makes winners out all three both through her singing voice ( remember she even creditably sang opera 1935 goin ' town ) through force her personality . now , this something we would missed out if sextette made silen t.t here number star cameo turns . it fun see regis philbin way back when ( i didn't realize he well known 1978 ) , it trip down memory lane see once-ubiquitous rona barrett , bit bizarre see one ed beheler playing jimmy carter , something he apparently made minor career out ( even some gop campaign ads ) . probably most touching cameo george raft , who played lead mae first film , night after night , 1932 . course mae loved surround herself bodybuilders , she gets scene number them here . these not just guys they picked up off street ; they all athletic credentials or hold titles such mr. america , indicated closing credits . okay , so gone wind it not ( hence 4 stars instead 5 ) . it still lot fun , it great see mae west go out such grand style	-1

look past surface this movie it really loneliness , range consequences around " falling love " someone you don't know . yeah , characters debauched , stupid things , but it all related their need " connect " someone . all them make mistakes , none them happy end . other reviewers mentioned , this isn't film everyone ; there several gross-out/desperate sex scenes , but they work context movie . i don't much more say hasn't already said ( said better ) other reviewers . i'll finish up adding if you went small , liberal arts college where everyone knew everyone , everyone business ( i ) , trust me , you " know " most people movie probably get weird combination nostalgia " thank god i'm past part my life ! " when watching this film . also features great 80 soundtrack probably best use cure song movie ... ever .	1

no , this movie isn't ' so bad its good ' or anyything stupid like , it genuinely entertaining . i think least three things ended up funny , but , if real people similar situation , probably would happen , such guy who acidentally pricks himself tranquiliser while attacked , which realisic considering he panicking his hand box tranquiliser darts . thankfully , aside horribly overused ' get out water!' line , movie avoids any clichï¿½s , unless you count character who acts surprisingly like steve irwin , which i doubt counts clichï¿½ since steve irwin actually real guy , although it strange so many australian characters monster movies act like him . i guess this going last time while though , because it going something taboo long time . while cgi creatures monster movies always some amount cuteness , jurassic park movies , where ' cuteness ' accidental result cgi creatures extremely stupid-looking , more recent movies , where it seems intentional , title creature possibly cutest cgi movie monster . i know fifty-foot crocodile swallows people who shouldn't able cute , but it . i guess this sign how anime tokusatsu influenced western culture over last decade or so	-1
i saw most this movie my children ; they watching little afternoon tv while i cleaned . i pretty surprised see content wicca religion , wicca songs earth wind fire sung " nice girls " vampire teeth . they made it sound like , " oh we wicca , there nothing wrong !

" i agree reviewer it should clearly stated this movie it contains content wicca . i only saw it tv , which i could turned off . what those who spent their good money it found out later it includes positive teaching paganism .	-1

that mostly what you need know movie - it intriguing notion . vampires recently announced their presence world , now they serum take instead drinking blood . nsa cop steven grant understandably upset this after his partner killed vampire , especially when he teamed up vampire cop aaron gray . however , they slowly reach uneasy truce start work together figure out who it killing people , since vampires actually peaceful people who find murder distasteful . way , gray introduces grant beautiful lucy westerna grant finds himself falling love . we meet some other very memorable characters - character west , who apparently slavic , looks sounds irish , interestingly enough ( i guess it because he slavering revolutionary ? ) . one most amusing things this - me anyway - overtones 1984 constant announcements nsa headquarters ( " open hand not grasp discipline " " nothing true , everything permissible " ) signs ( " informing your enemy makes him your friend " " one step forward 1/2 step back " ) ; not mention people dressed decidedly soviet military style or 50s style , everyone smoked all time . cinematography beautiful ; whole film washed out , creating almost black white effect , while retaining some color . all vampires quite pale , course , but other than their fangs , they really aren't so different - even children . acting pretty good who wouldn't love grant sexy voice ? ok , i'm fan vampire genre so course i'd like it ; but also this gave us different look world i enjoyed it thoroughly . if you like vampire flicks all , you'll love this one	1
i pleasantly surprised find movie current interesting it when it first came out . brilliant director talented actors contributed , but most important , , script , still fresh very much point . one not quote any more " greed good " because it politically incorrect . but , believe it , it still rules wall street corporate world . latest news selling america proves it . i recommend this dvd without any qualms .	1

i seen many takeshi kitano films , but this one haunts me especially . it very poetic , sad , beautiful , complex . what you say yakuza film begins serene , tender paintings ( kitano himself) ? kitano gives probably one his better performances here , playing yet version disillusioned cop , but more depth this time . this not say his other films shallow ( quite contrary ) , but here emotional resonance makes this film even more moving powerful . yes , it violent , but all kitano films , he doesn't wallow it , even though it brutal . i've always liked everything this man ( even his comedy kikujiro , which got terrible reviews ) , this probably my favorite his films .	1

i picked up this movie bargain bin decided give it try . boy , am i glad i ! this story tense strong . both scott wolf tim roth play good guys , it just they're motivated different things . roth sees wolf character " man he could " takes hit job personal vendetta . then , time progresses he takes new mind set , his outlook changes you find yourself rooting more his character than wolf . but there no bad actors this film . i never party five fan , but wolf acting here nothing short amazing ! story ends little too abruptly ( major plot thread left out there ) , but i still very satisfied movie when it over . way , it gets its rating mostly language ( there not really much ) subject matter serial killer . if they'd just toned down couple words , this could easily passed pg-13 . strong , compelling story hold you until film over . recommended	-1

edward lionheart shakespearean actor who more ham than talent . his plays savaged london critics , who now denied him great acting honor . he shows them error their ways . vincent price plays lionheart one his most effective slightly campiest roles . i say slightly campy because price actually effective job showing lionheart sympathetic manner , his reading shakespeare ( when he not doing it lionheart stage ) good . diana rigg lionheart daughter , edwina , psychotically effective price . lionheart sets out prove his critics wrong dispatching them ways drawn shakespeare plays . among methods , one set up kill his wife jealous rage then taken off ( othello ) . one upended butt wine ( richard iii ) . one pound flesh removed ( merchant venice ) . one stabbed hacked death crowd ( julius caesar ) . funniest ( slightly sickest ) reserved meredith merridew ( robert morley ) , who first finds great pleasure his two poodles he loves dearly ( titus andronicus ) . those who enjoyed this scene , i highly recommend julie taymor titus anthony hopkins . among actors playing critics , addition morley , some britain finest : dennis price , jack hawkins , harry andrews , michael hordern , several others . price known now , i suppose , hammy horror specialist . he made lot money enjoyed himself immensely doing it . but guy could good actor . i thought he very effective shelby carpenter laura . occasionally late night cable you see samuel fuller movie called baron arizona . price excellent it . i think theater blood first-rate movie , but it best enjoyed if you passing knowledge shakespeare plays . cliffs notes always it me . movie camp , witty , literate gory . nice combination . dvd transfer very good	-1

this remarkably good film one history great men . this film features above-average acting storyline reasonably true history , rather than hollywood puff piece . film begins caesar confrontation dictator sulla , ends course , his historic assassination senate . thing i liked best this film my opinion it fairly realistic look julius caesar . it mostly not try glorify him ( , example , colleen mccullough her masters rome series books ) . nor it demonize him . film shows caesar went gaul provoked wars mainly his own political purposes ( enhance his stature home ) when senate sought call him account , this what motivated him turn his army against rome essentially overthrow roman republic . these not necessarily laudable acts , film not gloss over these points . scenes caesar imperiously dictating harsh laws proscriptions senate show time his death , absolute power indeed corrupted caesar absolutely . film much better attention detail concerning roman parapernalia such lictors who attended roman consul , other similar details . purists appreciate this . excellent quality this film casting acting , both excellent . acting generally good . jeremy sisto criticized his portrayal caesar , but i thought he reasonably good job . richard harris absolutely nails role dictator , lucius cornelius sulla . christopher walken fine cato , although this not major role film . heino ferch very convincing vercingetorix ( king gauls ) . i not think jay rodan convincing mark antony . overall , though , this film surprises performances its generally excellent cast turns . this film sufficiently good , fact , one why it not " bigger " film . i not enjoyed film much this one several years , causing it merit 5 stars . sets , acting , dvd reproduction this film all excellent . this film satisfy those us who seek historical accuracy film one history great figures , but storyline similarly engage those who simply interested good dramatic entertainment . this one highly recommended	1

what ---- . " tale revenge " ? why everyone their review say ? b/c it written box cover ?? this interesting compelling movie , but w/ very odd , abrupt ending leaves you hitting " rewind " button saying , " what minute , it over ?? i miss something ?? " afte watching this , i scoured internet , wikipeida , amazon ... still no reviewer seems able say what meant ending this film . my takeaway it -- she going hang , die ( go heaven ); he going stay earth .. but maybe when they meet again ( heaven ) , they get married . ?????? how come no one else come up w/ definitive meaning end this film ? subtlety great , but not if it so damn ambiguous nobody universe seems able define or explain what this film all . it not revenge . maybe it love obsession sadness silliness despair . sorry , can't really recommend this one !	-1
i finally got round watching this history channel last night . it screened part black history month , which october here uk . it powerful piece filmmaking . movie barely started i already feeling its power . scenes brutality injustice black people endure during civil rights movement , combined mournful voice joan baez singing " birmingham sunday " just too much . tears came easily . i immediately knew i just it dvd . spike lee earned oscar nomination this documentary 1997 . i think he should won , ( statue went mark jonathan harris " long way home " ) , i think this possibly one most significant movies he ever made . he surprises avoiding firebrand rhetoric he known he tells this story how four young african american girls murdered white supremacist bombers back 1963 , without voice-over narration , opting instead story told those who there ; namely girls ' friends families , civil rights activists who birmingham time . using these interviews , some which joyful ( those who prefer remember girls way they lived ) , some which excruciatingly painful ( those still grieving their loss ) some which verge ridiculous ( namely , former alabama governor george wallace - you see it believe it ) interlacing them archive footage , lee firmly establishes segregational fervour hysteria existed birmingham , alabama 1963 . bomb went off september 15th year we given run up significant events preceded act devastating consequences followed it . it made very clear how denise mcnair , cynthia wesley , addie mae collins carole rosamund robertson died while it made equally clear ( comments bill cosby , instance ) , how world much poorer place without them . more significantly - although this probably never give girls ' families friends any solace - it strongly suggested their deaths acted catalyst led upward surge civil rights movement south , black vote end segregation . one man eventually convicted murders but his co-conspirators never caught . critics denialists often question point looking back , raking over past , opening up healed wounds , blah , blah , blah , but i'm one those firmly believes regardless our skin colour , we cannot possibly know where we're headed if we don't full picture clear understanding where we've come . i felt sadness , bewilderment anger watching this but i also felt lot pride . this important history lesson . let all those who ears listen .	1
first all , director mr. robert . webb quite home westerns so he delivers job . ( " white feather " dvd still one my unfulfilled dreams ! ) . robert ryan ( he great here ! ) mayo ( girl past ! ) they're perfect match romantic mature affair . well , since this one released 1956 , one can't avoid notice some " coincidences " or maybe " clichï¿½s " regarding other famous western movies : 1 . " high noon " ( 1952 ) - consider main idea - marshall alone face hired killers . arthur o'conell/lloyd brigdes play similar roles , denying help first but reconsidering later . remember kid first only offer help cooper/ kane . 2 . what say howard hawks ' " rio bravo " ( 1959 ) . same conflict . only help comes ex-bad girl hotel ( feathers/angie dicknson ) , jail keeper - same good old walter brennan extra hired helper , colorado ( ricky nelson ) who also brings girl eyecandy - jeffrey hunter - they even dress alike . only jeff more familiar gender . jeffrey hunter , fan , i've watched many his movies i think he didn't so well while playing such divided character thad anderson . when he grabs mayo hotel room , he totally not himself very far gentlemen type , unreproachable person he ( won him part christ kok ) . he pushed too much particular scene results so unnatural . other hand , there no doubt his unic presence screen adds plus this - time - western . nowadays , however , this might one best re-releases last two or three years . 3 . rio bravo bad guy name burdett here we saloon owner named barrett . 4 . let not forget city drunks paul . burns/ dean martin . if you compare you'll find more resemblances . but point " proud ones " 1956 while " rio bravo " release 1959 . oh , yeah , someone said richard widmark jeff already played same roles or similar characters " red skies montana " ( 1952 ) . sum up , who cares originals when we all these amazing actors , cinemascope great colors amuse us . buy all those dvds , watch many times you enjoy yourselves while you find out which one best performance . still say : there isn't single bat , spider , mummy , +fast or +whatever beat films like mentioned above . not even all gd " effects " world	1

sure , retail price four cds together $240 so $180 sounds like good value . except amazon selling first three cds $30 apiece fourth $41 which only adds up $131 . why world would someone pay extra $50 just buy all four once ? cds themselves great - no problem there . i just think someone amazon marketing division went little wonky this pricing no one caught it . seriously - save yourself some dough . until price all four cds drops below cost buying them separately this no bargain	-1
nova look storm drowned city large excellent study hurricane katrina , concentrating storm itself failure levee systems new orleans . no obvious political agenda , documentary only touches upon human aspect storm aftermath , pointing no fingers city , state , or federal government . it not if katrina took new orleans completely surprise , city dodged " big one " number occasions , including previous year . ivan monster storm changed direction last moment , sparing new orleans , everyone there must breathed sigh relief . i find it hard believe some city officials scoffed dire findings 2004 hurricane pam simulation major storm hitting city - it common knowledge decades powerful hurricane would flood new orleans . it beautiful city , but let face facts here : this last place anyone should built metropolis . we're talking bowl sitting several feet below sea level , bordered mississippi river lake ponchatrain , gulf mexico within hailing distance . expansion robbed city what little protection it storm surges , outdated levee system hid number vulnerabilities throughout city . documentary follows katrina path its origins off coast africa its fateful rendezvous gulf coast august 29 , 2005 . it offers one most understandable explanations hurricanes i've ever heard - why they form , how they behave , etc . katrina meanders her way across florida her way toward new orleans , we see communications parish officials experts national hurricane center - precautionary actions they began taking . days before katrina hit , everyone knew this could storm everyone dreading so long . strangely enough ( fortunately ) , we only see or hear mayor nagin once - when he calls mandatory evacuation city . this documentary really isn't government response- nor it even mention all irresponsible reporting days after storm hit . once katrina her worst moved , documentary shifts failures levee system . built withstand category three hurricane , there no wonder all incoming water overtopped some levees . bigger question why some city interior levees failed , since water never rose high enough overspill canals there . these areas , we see how levees broke due primarily water pressure . retrospect , they say underpinnings those canals should put deeper into ground when they built , but i'm not sure how effective would , real problem loose dirt foundation areas long shut off annual silt deposits mississippi river . final segment looks ways protecting new orleans future . even when fully repaired , levee system still vulnerable category 4 5 storms , meaning city no better off than it 2005 . some more radical solutions offered up here , however . example , one suggestion allow mississippi flood certain areas , it used , thereby building up disappearing wetlands used help protect city storm surges . when you consider time money required secure new orleans ' future , you wonder if it even worth it . devastating katrina , she not , truth told , " big one .

these words follow these next few paragraphs going seem snobbish boisterous , if it offends anyone , i apologize . yet , i cannot all my mustered soul , say i liked rollerball any way shape or form . if given opportunity walk hot cinders gasoline drenched feet or watch this horrid science-fiction , heavily symbolic film again , i would choose first . gasoline isn't bad , it ? muttering un-impassioned lines lead actor james caan , " your face " symbolic nature film , all way random unsolved moments johnathan his estranged wife , we ( viewers ) left nothing but sloppy film reeks symbolism deeply involved masses old sci-fi film only cult status because it released mid-70s . nothing more , nothing less . those sit here argue it huge film due visuals , elements strength government , power one man topple such corrupt way living , i cannot buy it . what i witnessed i watched this film nothing more than campy sci-fi film attempted smart 2001 , but instead just seemed recycled director norman jewison reading too much into " 1984 " " fahrenheit 451 " . i don't want sound like i hate intelligent cinema , when fact i crave it each every time i place film into my dvd player , what i don't like cinema blatantly symbolic just because it knows it trying reach opportunity thought cult film . rollerball , i feel like scenes too contrived overall nature it attempted represent . this needed simple film resistance against controlling government all tightly rolled into game known rollerball . jewison adaptation , i felt game rollerball got wrong end stick . i didn't feel like there enough time or dedication spent game . what really irritated me this film scenes games which tried look artistically like kubrick film , but failed , but also didn't enough cohesiveness hold film together . jewison could not " connect dots " our characters when they not roller rink . i mentioned this before , but i couldn't keep my eyes open long enough when caan spoke because he mumbled his lines ( providing little no emotion behind his character outside fact he really roller skate ! ) could not guide us through tunnel . central character , i felt he wrong fit this film . we needed someone strong , yet ability demonstrate verbally what they doing fight corporation . i also couldn't follow scenes party , scenes caan maud adams , eventuality moonpie . jewison left us guessing wanting more , but instead answers he would just throw us back rollerball game . it cheap move , i felt cheated him this film . end movie i saw some opportunities chances jewison didn't take , it angered me because this film could great , but every level it just fell short . i read other reviews say caan excellent choice this film because he represented aging sports star very well , but me he just fell flat . his acting , especially his speaking , seemed mumbled unemotional . i couldn't tell if he actually doing this fight corporation or just because jewison behind camera yelling " action " . i know caan capable so much more ; i just don't see why he didn't feel need give everything this character , unless he didn't see value him either . final scenes him moonpie laughable best , it just made me consider this film stronger emotional actor instead just your typical " man man " helmed this project . same said cardboard-esque representation we witnessed maud adams . emotionless babble . if jewison didn't us watching very loud mundane game rollerball , then he forcing us turn our volumes up down trying listen this emotionless babble coming mouths our actors . why didn't jewison get better actors ? i couldn't tell if it acting itself or direction just fouled this film . also , why 2018 look quite bit like 1975 ? if this where world headed , i need ask my father couple articles clothing ! overall , i cannot sit here recommend this film anyone . i read other reviews , i notice growing trend . you either going love this film or adamantly hate it . i seemed fall latter category . i willing give this film chance because i admire science fiction projects , but my hatred towards sports themed films got best me . there not surprises this film , there apparent lack innovation creating future , overall , game caan played wasn't great . i watched one match trouble watching rest . it seemed tedious boring view spectator . i realize hidden deeply within this symbolic references towards violence , media , corporate rule ... but honestly , if you would rather see film demonstrated better , you should check out oliver stone natural born killers avoid this film all costs ! thankfully , i remake here home watch later tonight . i know it horribly worse ( which seems impossible ) , but least it eliminate any remembrance i this utterly diabolical 1970s piece cinema . this definitely not one records books . shame you norman jewison ! grade : * out ****	-1

ramones raw basically marky ramone handheld camera annoying johnny , joey , dee dee c.j. while tour . there some great live footage band playing some classic songs . dvd doesn't really tell story but more narrative ramones life road . inner relations band not touched upon all . fact , watching ramones raw you'd never know johnny joey hated each other passion . most running time lighthearted gags inside jokes interspersed concert footage . complete look inner workings band , well making most their albums , pick up end century dvd it much more comprehensive look band whole . recommended ramones diehards completists only	-1
one my early saturday morning favorites kid . i get up watch fireball xl5 ! it also big topic discussion play playground during recess . robert robot favorite . while it may seem lame today standards ( computer graphics animation ) , it great its day though it rarely given any credit , it influenced science fiction series followed . great way jog memories baby boomers ! i just wish they would sell individual dvd show or least " best " dvd some better shows , like they " best thunderbirds " . this set may little pricey casual fans who just want show their kids or grandkids what cool when they growing up .	-1
i no intention watching this movie , none . there nothing it i thought i would like , but when friend mine wanted rent it , i nothing better , i watched it her . i wrong . i should wanted watch this one . it best understated , definitely overlooked . there few places where it bit ' out there ' me , but all all , i totally blown away how much i actually liked this movie . not kids . fact , probably not all adults , but if you like things little out ordinary , truly relate some more basal darker sides human nature , this sure send chill or two down your spine . there beautiful image love unrequited this movie , almost poetic nature , but so obscure it hard grasp it entirely . i consider it like i would work art , not everyone going understand it , nor everyone going get same things watching it , but i think it worth watching	-1
great escape portrays heroism prisoners never giving into their captors pompous honor nazi germany . group becomes monkey wrench all turns determined send their adversary russian front . my only complaint it shown letterbox format which saps some power story . wasn't this picture worth full screen format ? but this probably par epics era . stars carry load bigger life even though you peeking through window . steve mcqueen man epic tales this one not fail deliver . even doomed failure he never gives up . resist every last breath motto prisoners . guile guts served them well end germany defeated even if only small part escapades escapees . grit abounds through fiber every man sworn serve allied forces . we owe these men debt we never repay , but always respect . it takes courage put your own well second behind cause . unfortunately we seldom triumphed glory since time . this war made sense while successors seemed steeped politics . something normal person hard time understanding . let just hope global war put rest this one . we look back great escape admiration gratitude . but we never repay what sacrificed these men	1
out everything i own , this movie one sacred me ... this one my fave .. i've seen it countless times ... it great cast , great director .. willem dafoe amazing it ... i'd say out all movies he , i'd rate this one his best ! not best movie edward furlong though ( lt ; -- i'd say t2 him ) , but he played his role well .. ya gotta love danny trejo ... he great every movie . this movie pretty realistic ... i mean it written actual convict .. edward bunker ... there actual convicts movie extra , not mention trejo ( who real con well ... special features this movie explains this , gives interviews ... special features awesome .. ) . if you like this movie , look into some more works edward bunker , especially his books , " education felon " etc ... i can't express enough how great movie , so i'll end my review here ... if i could give this movie infinite amount stars i would , cuase it good . when i searching copy it , lowest it sold $30 , that what i ended up paying mine ... but i ready pay $50 it ... it definitely worth whatever price it sells ..	1
this arguably herzog greatest film . fact he not only finished film under most trying circumstances ever faced film director ( only apocalypse now comes close ) , but film true spectacle , amazing watch awe inspiring . kinski perfect fitzcarraldo , madman who wants build opera house inquitos natives . he wasn't even supposed film , but jason robards got sick during production , leave film . herzog carried kinski , notoriously difficult ( but brilliant right director ) actor gives role right amount passion surprising grace ( especially end film ) . location shooting superb , but when you see ship actually moving up mountain , you completely awestruck . even though you only see it move few inches , those inches feel like miles . this film should seen tangent burden dreams , because it makes you appreciate scope herzog achievement . this grand example herzog filmmaking , one most imaginative , daring films ever made ....	1
i never thought movie criminals could dumber than ones " dead presidents , " but kidnapping-for-drug-money plan this movie absolutely worse . soon i saw where this movie going , i just shook my head watched idiots go ( i'm talking characters -- not real actors ) . this movie pretty silly me . timberlake absolutely terrible thug , two people forewarned me this , but i figured i'd see myself . every time i heard him curse glanced his tattoos , i laughed louder . his friends even more entertaining ; bunch suburban kids who thought kidnapped cool ; guy so high out his mind he didn't realize up down ; ransom kid who so excited " criminal " scene he completely seemed forget he danger . i don't know where movie stores put this one when it comes out sale , but it really should go into comedy section . scene where they go " buddy , buddy , buddy " made my stomach hurt laughing goofiness . i'm sure that'll copied off high schools everywhere . thing actual plot story ( different actors without druggies ) would've great ; but people who played roles absolutely so out touch point where it looked like i watching vanilla ice video , or something close it . i would've given it more stars if movie meant parody drug dealing , but previews , it sounds like company going drama . cons : i could've gone without hearing constant racial slurs this movie . it annoys me when people culture say it ; so it definitely annoyed hell out me hear several characters use certain words . i didn't find all funny .	-1
it not best episode though it crowning piece . not best because there far too many too long battles which quite repetitive effects . but it essential episode understand or extract some meaning this fantasy . vanity human king turning criminal since he tries burn his surviving son , who he not like , alive . hobbit frodo who entrusted mission carrying ring back into pit hell also shown vain somewhere his mission . vain because he believes he entrusted this mission because he special , though fact it mission going make him future somewhat special . vain too because he not understand he cannot succeed alone . there help sam dramatically shown essential fulfill his mission , not betray it , not let some kind disgusting giant spider deep caves earth distract him rob him ring , which it actually , not fall into pit himself underground traitor ring . but lesson more us than hobbit himself since he not seem learn his simple lesson very easily . main lesson batttle only won when everyone , including dead come up fight . this inclusion dead into fight makes it slightly spectacular allusion jesus other saviors who go down into limboes or hell some salvaging adam eve or euridyce . but meaning - film - comes some strong imagery used fair level insistance . world cut two . dark forces evil one side whom ring returned order destroyed , all others representing light . contrast light darkness , underground traps , caves tunnels open air countryside , blue sky very dark grey if not black sky , more or less civilized use fire good side its evil use bad side . final battle front black gate looks like wall finally crumbles sinks into ground end like some other wall fell 1989 . only modern vision since when books written wall question not even stand . since then this image turned around since two walls built but no longer forces east or north , but forces west , one palestine other mexico northern border ( case north not supposed bad side , yet ) . history twisty times . books written during cold war they represent this vision time world cut two , black white , etc . this today changed too this simple splitting reality two not correspond reality though it still very active minds people who still think lot either/or line . so today , what used reflection cold war fear becomes rather simplistic we experience everyday how this approach world life leads catastrophes other swampy situations . end this third episode return peace quiet turns slightly emotional not say sentimental or even sentimentalese . too much crying indeed too much sadness compensated joy peace , love couple weddings . altogether it brings tale end but it not reach height second episode , though we see some inspiration recent series field fantasy , harry potter who links modern world this underground fantasy world like stephen king dark towerdr jacques coulardeau , university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne	-1

lucio fulcis zombi 2 my opinion greatest zombie movie ever made[dawn dead close second]and should every horror fans collection . people say its rip off romeros films , but doesnt every zombie film take something night or dawn dead . romero basicaly created whole undead zombie genre . fulcis picture actually quite original . setting tropical islands south america very effective . zombies look amazing , much better than romeros blue shaded gut munchers . fulcis zombies rotting , decaying monsters . each one its own original qualities . only thing i dont love movie pacing . it takes like 40 minutes film get going , but once it get going its nonstop zombie gorefest . speaking gore , zombi 2 plenty it . wooden splinter through eye scene this day one most infamous gore scenes ever put onto film . if you havnt seen this movie then you should first punch youself face then go buy it immediatly .	1

my vote most underrated film 2002 tuxedo , bittersweet romance starring jackie chan jennifer love hewitt . chan stars jimmy tong , lovable misfit who owns antique bookstore . hewitt plays del blaine , bookish college student insatiable hunger word-puzzles . jimmy ( understandably ! ) enchanted love-inspiring curves coed lush body . though initially reluctant , del eventually swayed asian bookseller quirky charm ... his wardrobe ! jimmy woos his beloved aid confidence-enhancing outfit title . its second act , film turns into road odyssey . jimmy convinces his best friend rex ( played joe namath , former quarterback los angeles rams ) travel across country him search j.d. salinger , legendary author franny zooey . one film most endearing delights salinger cameo , his sole on-screen appearance . touched grace style , salinger resembles latter-day cary grant or silvery jimmy stewart , silver fox who win anyone over twinkle his eye . final scene candlelight dinner olive garden . when stars kiss , it clear chan more verve than men half his age . electricity two leads undeniable	1
this excellent movie all formation , training , ultimate disastrous ordeal under fire australian horse dragoon 1915 during ww i . mel gibson mark lee play two main characters , different backgrounds but similar their patriotic fervor superb running ability . movie three parts : first takes place australia where gibson lee introduced become friends ; second cairo where they train ; third gallipoli where they eventually slaughtered , thanks poor british planning failure british commanders muster up take initiatives when they became available . ( ironically , retreat gallipoli peninsula after operation doomed failure british planning masterpiece hardly man lost . ) second part bit too long , though first very good third superb . it meant , watching annihilation australians battle scenes excruciating . authentic feel period achieved through close attention details , russell boyd photography eye-popping . top-notch production all way	1
always one my favorites , it seems get better age , timepiece it . closer cloris leachman timothy bottoms i think one best closing scenes movies , ben johnson soliloquy fishing hole also memorable . if i one gripe movie there seems too much cybil shepherd , considering how great rest cast . but that quibble . its own way i think this movie everything " american graffiti " same time . says lot coming age also growing old understated , wistful fashion . great soundtrack , too . best kudo i throw this movie when mickey mantle watched it he broke out crying , it rang so true ( mick growing up godforsaken corner oklahoma same time this movie takes place godforsaken patch texas ) .	1
well .... i just recieved this disk i very high hopes ... let me say , most met .... but there couple things i got tired real fast ... first all , if i wanted see many crowd shots , i would bought " dancing party people : movie " .... i would loved see disk mostly man himself giant screen background ... would cool ... show me what it like crowd , not crowd itself ..... there couple quick shots chapter 14 , min into chapter show perfectly what i mean .... my other complaint man himself ..... he really comes across butt-load full ego .... many , many , many instances him striking " jesus christ pose " ... all my years going parties , i yet see dj this much he during this set .... other than those complaints , i nothing but praise it ..... i not checked out special features yet , just movie itself i truly dig it ... music top notch , quality picture sound supurb .... although this may not mean much , seeing how this my first review , i fully recommend this disk fans electronica everywhere ....	-1

" 2001 maniacs " , my opinion , only type horror movie that really , really hard get right 2000s : horror-comedy . everything else under horror banner - monster movies , ghost stories , psychological thrillers , slash/carnage-type horrors , etc . - all them lot great representatives recent years , all over world . there humorous moments number horror greats - " freddy vs . jason " , " final destination " series , " bruiser " , etc . - but almost all attempts full horror-comedies , my opinion , stalled - most them would better picking one style or other maybe trying inject little bits other instead walking line directly ( i admit i haven't chance see " slither " yet , but one look promising ) . " 2001 maniacs " huge success horror-comedy though , reminding one greats like " re-animator " " evil dead 2 " so gloriously plowed fields outrageously bizarre . three groups young travellers - least two them heading off popular spring break destination - take wrong detour end up surreally odd town where it still seems pre-civil war old south , eve large annual festival , populated characters ranging merely odd ( sometimes likably so ) truly disquieting . locals familiar cars modern technology but just don't seem any ; travellers assume this all tongue-in-cheek re-creation old south , charmed enough overflowing hospitality some town residents ( including its gregarious mayor - wickedly played robert englund ) they decide ditch their previous plans accept invitations stay weekend enjoy festivities . wincing but overlooking truly tasteless parts ' re-creation ' , they settle what looks fun weekend all - until things start take creepier more threatening tone ... talented cast turn what could really stupid , crude comedy into something really flows film just enhances its weird vibe . several characters , judging their first moments movie , could turned out so excessively unlikable drag movie , but too averted you get know them . robert englund global treasure - he plays this role pefection - he almost all his movies - knows precisely what bring each moment . " 2001 maniacs " bloodily inventively violent , unpredictably quirky , sexy enough exposure keep both guy girl viewers happy . well-made unorthodox , it welcome addition 2006 rich horror offerings	-1

this 1984 performance " eugene onegin " kirov just marvelous . when they're their game , nobody performs russian opera like russians , this performance sense real occasion . it hard know where begin praise - voices , characterization , sets - they all terrific . all four main singers young , good looking , excellent stage presence , inhabit their characters superbly fine voice . drama very real here , everyone inside their role , even smaller parts . there not wobbly voice bunch . none old fashioned , curdly-voiced female singers use inhabit russian performances too often . sergei leiferkus poised , dark onegin , even gaining one sympathy end . tatiana novikova lovely , lyrical soprano radiant tatiana , totally believable both young ingenue later gremin wife . larissa dyadkova joyous outgoing without going overboard olga , yuri marusin impassioned tortured lensky . prince gremin famous love aria act 3 , sung nikolai okhotnikov , so poignantly it practically brings down house . staging traditionally , best befits opera , lovely costumes beautiful , evocative sets would hard match . glorious ! unlike first two amazon reviewers this video , i thought picture sound just fine . fact , balance voices orchestra model clarity , both well projected easy hear . conducting yuri temirkanov ( who not mentioned kultur dvd presentation ) quite broad very poignant , yet he all requisite drama fire when called . temirkanov particularly good transitions lyrical dramatic subjects . kirov orchestra very fine , special kudos first horn . chorus dancers must also receive special praise . good russian choruses special ring them so right this music , dancing ( this , after all , kirov ! ) joy . among few mostly insignificant caveats some excess audience coughing , some minor picture flutter distance shots , tendency film too much dancing too far away . nothing get remotely boil . this dvd classic status written all over it . easy 5 stars	1

this review refers " les liasions dangereuses " - 270 minute extended edition(wellspring dvd ) ... i love this story try see every version it comes out . this one made 2003 , wonderful josï¿½e dayan , purely exquisite . this tale deadly seduction updated adapted 1960 . good choice director , we get see it played out differently although much closer present , still gives feel 40 years ago , moralities key players might still considered bit shocker . this update , story revolves around center arts , run none other then woman we all love hate , madame de mereuil . she long time , off again lover , valmont scheme connive destroy relationships lives . revenge madame wish , valmont only too happy comply her wishes , knowing she his reward end . he best when seduction hand . but things get complicated valmont , when his heart takes unexpected turn towards madame tourvel . innocent bystanders , young cï¿½cile de volanges virtuoso musician raphael danceny , also get pulled into web deceit . valmont wants out though , must find weakness put end madame merteuil . it marvelous tale wickedness . now , i know some may agree me no one compare john malkovich take valmont , but i must say , rupert everett quite convincing actually , physically , takes look devil himself . who else but catherine deneuve , could follow act like glenn close . deneuve take little different , she gives madame multi-faceted personality times even likeable . so we , audience , get drawn into her schemes well . she so beautiful , even now , one hardly take their eyes off her . nastassi kinski madame tourvel leelee sobieski cecile . both turning excellent performances . danielle darrieux , valmont wise aunt , who seems see all . it excellent production . beautiful vivid colors take you back 60 . fabulous costumes , scenery . presented widescreen(anamorphic ) 5.1 sound french english subtitles . it three part production . each part separate disc , each running hour half . sure catch lengthy conversation dayan special features . play game once more this absolutely mesmerizing update . merci beaucoup .... laurie	1
if you already own " half baked , " don't waste your money " fully baked edition " dvd , because extras huge waste time -- added comedy bits so poor it embarrassing , like something high school kids would produce . director commentary also thoroughly uninteresting -- unless you wanted play smoking game it -- take hit every time she says " funny .

steve railsback stars this imaginative different sci-fi film alien vampires . i first saw this when it came out liked it because it so different . special effects predate cgi , they not incorported into film , where films strength lies . moreover , plot itself extremely interesting suspenseful . steve railsback american air force officer assigned astronaut program . he only survivor his spaceship . when he lands back earth emergency pod , search what happened crew , what happening earth . there strange occurances beginning happen london , people beginning turn into vampires . aliens space made earth their giant blood bank , race destroy three aliens who landed earth . film very good , leaves you susense . i really liked way director , tobe hooper , used alien vampires film . different treat time . i recommend film , parts which dated , however , this not detract films suspense or thriller element . recommended . it definetly worth watch .

watching tv series dvd where you whole season go through whatever speed you wish , delightful treat . i hooked first season dvd almost felt post partum depression when it episode 13 finished i realized i didn't second season hand keep following adventures vic mackey all others barn farmington . quickly remedied one-click amazon two days later i second season hand . during this season you brought up quest hijack money train strike team , capt . acevada quest city council seat , thefurther marital problems vic mackey , civilian auditor report fallout many , many sub plots continue swirl through this amazing series . there no disappointment second season . once again , i found myself watching 13th episode wondering where time gone then scurring computer right after it finished order third season . series probably not everyone . there considerable violence , much bad language , some conversations sex sexual orientation not young ears , it adult fare it comes you like runaway freight train . it also compelling fascinating . i never seen anything like it tv	1
someone who practicing pilates quite awhile now , i am always lookout short pilates workouts which appropriate my intermediate level ; i also prefer my pilates videos mainly abs-focused . happily , this 20 minute overall body workout fit bill perfectly . although it purports full-body workout , it actually concentrates mainly abs area , some back work thrown counterbalance . also , performed instructor amy brown , this workout definitely intermediate level ( " beginner workout " referred dvd case simply amy assistant , liza , showing modifications , not separate workout ) . workout begins pilates breathing reclined position . then amy moves what she calls " hundreds " but which different version this exercise than i've ever seen before : she simply breathes her legs air her head up . fact , throughout this workout , amy adds many unique variations traditional pilates matwork , such doing twist while holding teaser . i also found sequencing exercises very different what i've come expect pilates . example , right after hundreds , amy goes into criss-cross , rolling like ball comes fairly late workout . however , i thought sequencing worked very well , especially amy tendency balance out series abs moves some brief back work ; i liked this lot . there only one side-lying move , but because i prefer abs work , i didn't mind this . thing i liked this workout pacing : amy higher number reps than you usually see pilates workout , but pace never rushed . other hand , this workout moves steadily no down time exercises . amy concludes workout few neck stretches , which i absolutely loved ! overall , i found this very enjoyable , thorough pilates workout , i know i get lot use it	1

" sealab 2021 " great show . fifteen minute episodes regularly managed pack twice many laughs your run-of-the mill half-hour sitcom -- it fast-paced hilarious . this season itself , however , show started going downhill slightly ( i think ) during episodes found season 3 set ( although " red dawn " " craptastic voyage " still couple my favorites ) . ( final ) episodes these season 4 dvds continued this trend , show just not quite good its last few episodes . however , this one some good stuff -- i liked " shrabster " lot , though i don't think all my fellow fans agreed one . we all agree , however , " cavemen . " , course , none episodes bad " der dieb " ( probably least funny episode series ) . if you haven't seen " sealab 2021 " yet , yourself favor pick up season 1 first -- it best ; you'll laugh your head off through " stimutacs . " this one completists , but they'll completing great show -- ya gotta love " sealab . " fignuts	-1
i hadn't seen this while until recently , it still me my toes . this came out when i high school , but i didn't see it until after i graduated ... but i remember hype it " racy " . i really didn't know what think it first ... but after seeing it few times , it grew me . maybe it sex ... or crime drama thriller ... killers getting away killing ... or combination above . i remember hearing reading stone mixed-review performance beforehand , but after seeing it myself , i personally thought it fit character . you never really trust her , although times you almost want . i hadn't even really seen douglas any movies before this . if you liked this , than fatal attraction must see well ( i didn't see fa until after this one ) . throw here beautiful score jerry goldsmith ( which classical musician i noticed ) , well what become one my favorite dance tracks since i heard it high school , la tour " blue " dance club scene roxy . far flaws , i agree reviewer realism her antics she getting questioned . what wrong these guys , what really makes her so special ? they really haven't seen anything like her , polygraph guy says ? that main thing bothered me , but it movie , long you know , don't take it too seriously . there lots funny moments , esp . curran friend gus ... " that magna cum laude ***** fried up your brain ! " i didn't know this same director starship troopers showgirls , but this far better 3 . i think this one those movies where you either like it or you don't . again , movies aren't always supposed realistic , so just appreciate it what it . some movies keep you watching it more than once , others don't ... you don't always valid reason why . me , this just one those movies :)	-1
here thing : northern exposure one greatest series ever grace airwaves . no matter what music playing behind it , it still same scripts , same actors , same plotlines , same energy cast , same spirit show . if you actually remember every scrap music played during original run series cbs , try this out : whenever you hear different music what you think ought there , just hum missing music yourself . problem solved , right ? would it nice if original music included these sets ? maybe . it effect show any way whatsoever ? hardly . it still brilliant show , dvds close we're ever going get original show . take what you get , folks , because they didn't release them all ..	1

i watched this directors other movie " dancer dark " while i didn't like it , i felt it very different cookie cutter movies hollywood turns out , so i gave this movie chance 2 1/2 hours later i found myself wondering if director this movie anti-depression drugs or what ? this darkest most nightmare induceing film i ever seen . story young girl who marries finds love outside her faith , only her husband cripled , just not what i ever want see again . some may like it , but directors(in both films i seen)must fun around , both films kind leave you so dumps you feel(at least i do)unclean seen it ! i find myself hopeing this man finds himself some help , because he seems very down life all humans world . some may like it i said , but i'd watch 24 hours test patterns before i'll watch this kind downer movie ever again !!!!!!	-1

great military movie . it shows what airmen during vietnam war ( or american war , if you're reading this vietnam ) wanted - take fight enemy . great wish airmen come true big screen . retired air force member , i laugh all naval antics shore leave because today military makes them verboten . carrier landings bars angeles city or olongapo no longer exist since us military ordered out there . still , guys great fun letting loose this movie then faced death when time came . scene where willem dafoe his pilot avionics failure , it made me sit edge my seat , because former avionics technician who worked f-16s , i could feel fear subtle panic they facing during battle . i always ensured my avionics components worked so our aircrews would not experience sensation . note : captain , who trying aircrew disobeying orders , fred dalton thompson ; he wasn't mentioned credits some reason . great movie storyline , superb antics troops shore leave , really cool aerial footage . must add your war film collection	-1

first i'll say this movie classic kung-fu movie providing everything you could ask , including : blind villianrandom fight tournamentone-armed heroflying guillotinemany different types fightersthe precursor dhalsim street fighter2booby traps one even two hit combosafter reading other reviews here i feel need talk quality dvd . i think lot reviewers way too picky their expectations . this freaking late 70 kung-fu movie made overseas budget couple thousand dollars i'm guessing . if you want see slick glossy movie perfect quality then rent jet li newest straight video movie possibly starring dmx . i understand quality could better , but who cares ? what you really expect when you buy this kind movie ? sure , some parts dubbing suddenly switched subtitles then switched back minute later , but just adds whole cheesy kung-fu experience . if this dvd wasn't good enough you quaility otakus then grow pair restore movies yourself . seriously , eat it	1
this very good movie i watched my " horror classics collection : 50 pack " ( asin : b0001hagtm ) i got amazon ( under $20.00 ! ) . so first off , i would recommend buying 50 pack where you get 2 other vincent price movies ( bat last man earth ) 47 other good movies almost same price buying this movie itself . far this movie goes , there few suspenseful parts you wonder what going happen . mainly , movie give you some memorable quotes , vincent price always deliver great voice his . all characters good job acting ( typist great scream ! ) . some parts seem bit unbelievable some questions don't seem get answered , but who really cares ? only 75 minutes long , this movie better than most horror movies come out today unoriginal go shock value . so while this might more murder mystery than " horror " movie , it worth watch you'll satisfied end ... unless course , you not like black white movies , if case , then you probably wouldn't reading this review . p.s. i love gary . taylor review when he says : " price plays it slightly prissy , very high-camp manner tremendous dose black humor which he so famous . " that so true	-1
i theory : audiences getting smarter . whereas before big hollywood movie massive marketing push would've all rage , now people starting know better . they're realizing terrible movie terrible movie no matter how often we see julia roberts deal more romantic comedic mishaps or much stuff michael bay destroy . so when movie comes like john malkovich , or memento or even visually impressive like matrix , we stand up take notice . building career largely inventive music videos , first time director spike jonze comes out gate probably most unconventional comedy you'll see . loserly craig schwartz ( john cusack , always good ) aspiring puppeteer who can't get any work . then he his dishevelled looking wife lotte ( cameron diaz ) leaving their small new york apartment pets everywhere since lotte pet store worker . craig , due his puppeteering skills gets accepted company located , amusingly , 7 1/2 floor , complete cramped ceilings . he also strong attraction one his co-workers , feisty maxine ( catherine keener ) . one day while working , he discovers small day going inside he finds out he see world through john malkovich eyes 15 minutes unceromonious dump new jersey turnpike ditch . craig maxine get idea : charge 200$ people experience john malkovich which novel idea until lotte goes through feels deeper connection , especially around idea maxine . then we bizarre love square or star or something since craig loves maxine who loves lotte but only when lotte inside john malkovich ... ' head . try not wrap your head around it since it better explained movie after awhile you don't even worry stuff like vessels or portals , you just go it . casting course important no one seems wasted , even diaz , who i normally can't stand . real treat though course malkovich since times you almost can't tell if he acting or if he really quirky . then there comedy which subtle first-was-funny-but-now-it-ain't like 7 1/2 floor small ceilings but then film shows you what happens when malkovich steps through his own portal it becomes not only technical marvel but one flat-out funniest things i've seen lately . only problem story certain point it shifts gears film almost speed walks its climax rather than lurching forward , like it shot foot . like amazon review says , i don't know if film warrant repeat viewings you get more out it every time you see it but first viewing quite something	-1

until i browsing through showtime television other night . i like robin williams , so i figured it worth checking out i'm actually really glad i . i'd never seen movie advertised so i didn't know anything plot . basically , williams plays man who known ' cutter ' . cutters take memory implants people brains when they die scan their entire lives make one hour or so ' remembering ' type thing dead person funeral . many people really like idea it , while others think memories best left remembered your own . there some indication picketing christian groups who think it against god use implants . everything william life surrounds one event , he unable remember clearly , but carried him guilt event , until one day , while cutting man who recently died , he see boyhood friend his it triggers quest find out where this man what happened him ... hopefully alleviate his guilt over even t.t urns out , he wasn't remembering things exactly way they happened . we lot human beings ... our emotions taint our perceptions , but one thing memory implants don't feel , so they record it exactly it happened . i won't reveal much more so not spoil plot , but i say movie good , but ending left bit desired . all all , it worth watch	-1

there no doubt this movie classic , after watching it once i could see why . after repeated viewings movie started grow me . movie isn't scary i though it would initially , however it still quite scary movie . i would certainly rate this movie amongst my favourites all time . some people say movie starts off bit slow drag places but i disagree . it start off father merrins story or else movie plot would make no sense . whole movie gripping harrowing . this essential view anyone who loves good gruesome shock now	1

sometimes film version novel falls greatly short original material ( demi moore execrable 1995 re-invention scarlet letter ) other times motion picture rises far beyond story upon which it based : happily , this version last mohicans probably foremost example latter possibility . this simply among my favorite movies all time , how anyone fail swept up this one mystifies me . telling superior version james fenimore cooper hopelessly plodding 1826 classic , verdant appalachians north carolina standing 1750 new york book , there everything one could want here , violent war , tender love scenes , stirring score , panoramic captures natural beauty so perfect it little short sin show this movie anything but widescreen format . daniel day lewis , always captivating his performances , delivers central character , heroic white man raised mohican , hawkeye ( here re-named nathaniel breen ) who first leads band newly-arrived scots through danger british outpost wilds , then later after surviving brutal massacre , tracks woman he loves across frontier hostile huron village , where he undertakes courageous rescue . that course razor-thin description multi-faceted plot , but trust me , there more going here than i could easily describe review three times this size . this director cut took me moment appreciate , since i'd seen theatrical release so often vhs , but watched both versions now , i think there scope this release dvd enhances film even mega-fan like me .	1
when it comes sex there few basic positions everyone seems use . missionary , doggy , spooning , oh my favorite ... woman top . although video focuses basics , they build these adding variations each these well add seated side side positions . additional pointers provided hosts how prolong sex , how make sex better , well different techniques make your partner scream joy . filming tasteful . models attractive . presentation information straight forward . overall , i give this dvd 5 stars	1
up until today , i would given this wonderful movie , which we watched my spanish class , 5+ stars . but i not all like ending ; it very much ruined it me . i'm person who needs closure . yes , this movie demonstrating tragic topic should sad . but just cruel , end poor little girl singing how she so lost . we don't know her fate . i also felt roberto sort villainized character . he point gaby lose mother . i hope alicia , when she left , going get gaby . what i would like know what they decided sara , her possible grandmother . again , i need closure ! i expecting depressing ending , but not left hanging like this ! arghhhhh . i also problem gaby born captivity . it makes scene where little boys suddenly burst into her room kind pointless ; it meaningful , powerful , one my favorite scenes until i realized she just startled . i guess it still meaning , but , i dunno . just my nitpicky , i guess . i also want know who pedro . also , what gaby possible parents got them arrested . i realize it could something very minor , but it would nice know . all i know they all could gun-toting revolutionaries . overall though , it wonderful movie i am considering buying it myself . i especially loved scenes involving las madres abuelas de la playa de mayo . acting fantastic . i just am bothered all these questions never answered	-1

i agree some previous reviewers : this matthew bourne his best : he genius story-teller choreographer . his swan lake become top notch variation classic ballet his recent nutcracker bound become same . those us who no chance ever seeing this production staged theater , this dvd not missed . i find watching it arousing ( full meaning word ) , emotionally shattering , ultimately cleansing manner classic tragedy . i agree others previous reviewers : nervous , mtv style camera work distracts dancing overall composition this brilliant theater piece . his commentary bourne offers sort reasoning hyperactive cutting back forth but it comes across after-the-fact attempt save integrity his own work . there indeed too many close-ups prevent viewer seeing dancers dance , just eye settles movement camera shifts . but i found second viewing i could watch sections dvd slow motion without sound track could see appreciate lot more bourne remarkable sense pattern movement terrific discipline energy dancers . i give this dvd five stars because this only version i am ever likely see even its directorial flaws it conveys high artistry erotic energy not only bourne reworking bizet carmen but also essence original opera . i think bourne work staying power we treasure his productions over years , above all perhaps magnificent swan lake . but where dvd his cinderella set wwii london ?	1

i love this movie few reasons . one those reasons i'm huge fan previous film ' whole nine yards ' which this serves sequel . next fact bruce willis one best underrated actors out there captivates my attention every performance he gives . third , biggest reason i love this film little scene where jimmy ( willis ) oz ( perry ) visit local pub get little ( or lot ) drunk . whole scene worth price rental . i guess since it reminds me so much myself my friends ( i'm emotional drunk ) whole morning after thing so way it would happen . all all laughs there , some forced gags bit cheesy . ' whole nine yards ' far superior film , but this sequel not without it moments bruce willis matthew perry great comic team . bruce tackle everything action comedy drama should recognized little more . this may not end up your favorite title but it won't your least . premise follows oz jimmy they try rescue oz wife ( jimmy ex ) mob boss trying get revenge jimmy . amanda peet plays jimmy wife whose fed up softy jimmy become trying tough contract killer jimmy once . there subplots twist end makes this more than no-brainer , but fact still remains film makes little sense ... but it doesn't really matter . just sit back , relax , don't think it enjoy it what it ... or least watch drunk scene , then pop ' whole nine yards ' really enjoy yourself	-1

this one greatest games i missed , 3 quarters anyway . i only saw 4th qtr wished i seen entire game . now i see this entertainingly high-scoring , last-minute affair many future nfl stars this dvd . previous reviewer stated though , video/image quality somewhat poor(the audio isn't great either ) . during some replays or image transitions , you see some pixellated images . closer you screen , more noticeable flaws course overall it definitely not up quality dvd standards . said , it still watchable visuals usually good enough most part color vivid if you watch it its natural 4:3 mode , it looks really good sharp times . ( note : i watching dvd 52 " rca hdtv-compatible big-screen philips 60 " hd-built tv . it looks better if you view it fullscreen mode , but i like watch it panoramic/ 16:9 view my big-screen , which unfortunately stretches images little hence extra pixellation ) . content , it delivers this area . * handful brief featurettes concerning university texas football team , emphasis vince young . * game its entirety , including pre-game bit ferrel/usc vs matt mccounaghy(sp)/texas . * get this ... two condensed , bonus highlights great game texas ohio state , blowout texas ou ! i not expecting this pleasantly surprised they there(esp classic ohio state ) . ( note : these highlights terrible bootleg-looking image quality , but still watchable)this how i would rate this release : 5 stars , if you loved game or love college football , you've got it your collection . 5 stars , if you're texas fan . national championship you won , plus bonus features including 2 other game highlights . 3 stars , if you loved game or texas longhorns demand only best picture quality available because it . this dvd let you down case . personally , i thought game great enough offset not-so-great image quality(which still very watchable imo comparable other releases this type ) . overall , highly recommended ; but i wish they would better job putting these dvd together concerning quality control	1

i now seen two judy garland movies -- wizard oz this one . all bets off third . i could go singing morbid distinction judy final film . she plays -- get this -- world famous tough-talking yet vulnerable vocalist tormented personal life appetite prescription medication martinis . quite stretch . overall , this movie confused hybrid melodramatic soap opera , london travelogue , " live " judy garland stage performance . it probably filed under " musicals " your video store , but that not really accurate -- nobody spontaneously breaks out into wizard oz-style song dance production numbers . instead , tunes performed judy alter-ego " character " jenny bowman pseudo-live sold out ( course ) solo shows london palladium . she sings handful oddly forgettable unremarkable showstoppers , including title song which features unfortunate lyrics such these : i could go singing , til cows come homeand rooster starts crow , crow , crowwhen i see your eyes , i go all out i must vocalizetil you shout " enough already ! " i could go singing , til moon turns pinkanything faust ink-a-dink-a-dink ! not even judy manage deliver this stuff convincingly , but she gives it her best sho t.t he notable exception little-known gem torch song , " it never you " kurt weill , which certainly deserves heard more often . there also some remarkable instrumental soundtrack music mort lindsey ( co-composer jeopardy theme song ) , especially zippy " helicopter ride " symphony experimental , ives-ian " matt dilemma " interlude . you get see judy son ( matt -- dilemma he doesn't yet know he judy son ) performing gilbert sullivan drag , if that kind thing you're int o.o therwise , jack klugman , dick bogarde , rest cast merely props judy stage , though kid who plays matt likeable enough chap i guess . dramatically , though , i could go singing awfully cornball , overwrought stuff , it all comes abrupt , unsatisfying conclusion . it also doesn't help mgm dvd cheapo affair no bonus features speak ( no , " theatrical trailer " doesn't count ) only barely adequate mono sound . grade :	-1

out seemingly endless amount slasher films released early 1980s , house sorority row stands out superior example genre . graduating seniors theta chi want one final party before leaving college facing real world . there just one problem . their rather puritanical house mother , mrs. slater , absolutely forbids them engage any activites involving booze , premaritial relations , drugs , or anything else made college so much fun circa 1983 . so , logically enough , girls react pulling prank unintentional result apparently killing old witch . unfortunately , mrs. slater bad manners die just party get started . what group up-and-coming sorority girls ? well , they basically end up dumping mrs. slater house filthy pool then go attend perhaps most uncomfortable party their lives . however , party gets going , they discover mrs. slater body no longer pool . , night progresses , girls start disappear one one unseen stalker makes its way through sorority house , armed only slater surprisingly sharp cane ... needless say , plot description doesn't really this film justice . however , slasher films -- whole -- probably most predictable genres . mark good slasher film it holds audience interest even though audience already knows pretty much everything that going happen . this task house sorority row easily accomplishes . whole , entire cast gives performances cut above what one usually expects this type film . if victims all pretty much types , actresses playing them all likeable rather endearing chemistry . though most them clearly too old just now graduating college , they believable group who friends four years . its own way , house sorority row almost becomes diner all female cast slasher subplot . all girls well but standout performances given kate mcniel ( who probably one best so-called " final girls " slasher film history ) , harley kozack , especially eileen davidson . vicki , instigator prank , davidson probably one most likeable " bad girls " ever . her growing exasperation just how difficult it cover up one simple accidental homicide borders both hilarious oddly touching . house sorority row directed mark rosman it his sure touch elevates this film above its genre . he protegee brian depalma obvious watching film smoothly executed set pieces which manage create level suspense absent most other slasher films . towards end film , mcniel must face killer while under influence sedative rosman shoots these scenes her point view psychedelic style threatens actually give good name psychedelic styles . all all , rosman creates sadly underrated thriller house sorority row	-1

i've fan alejandro gonzalez inarritu since 2003 ' 21 grams ' so when they aired `amores perros ' ifc few weeks back i just watch it . following same formula ' 21 grams ' inarritu gives us brilliant story interconnects lives three very different people very tragic event . we first octavio ( gael garcia bernal ) who living his brother ramiro ( marco perez ) his wife susana ( vanessa bauche ) . ramiro abusive cold this leads heated affair octavio susana . order make enough money two them run off together octavio begins fighting his rott money . we next daniel ( alvaro guerrero ) , tv producer who gives up his life his family order pursue relationship supermodel valeria , but tragic car accident causes their relationship unravel , their nerves get frayed their love slowly painfully die . last story trilogy revolves around el chivo ( emilio echevarria ) , homeless man who makes money hitman . when el chivo hired businessman kill his partner only find out his partner also his brother , he chance teach them both lesson learn something himself . it may car crash links these three stories , but it people within them , lives they live lessons they learn connect them such deeper more meaningful level . acting brilliant here , both bernal echevarria turning out award worthy work , truth told debut directorial piece inarrito delivers near flawless film	1

highest praise i give any movie , while watching it , i begin dread fact it end . i found this story enjoyable .... then some . lead character , ripley , presented well-aged version sociopathic con artist played matt damon " talented mr. ripley " . played inimitable john malkovich , this older , wiser ripley infinitely more sophisticated , sly , treacherous , fascinating . he lives wonderful italian villa gorgeous wife/mistress who knows embraces his true nature . when publicly insulted neighbor , played dougray scott , he initiates plot gain revenge , ultimately turning innocent man into hired killer who then tortured his own conscience .... punishment could never affect consciousless , sociopathic mr. ripley . malkovich unique actor , never content merely show up speak his lines convincingly , he actually becomes character ... every devilish smile , lick lips , flash anger , etc . becomes expressive action character , not actor . he so completely suited this role it impossible envision anyone else playing par t.t he dialog wonderful .... complex , intellectually stimulating , natural . indeed , some comments nature ( absence ) conscience guilt achieve level fine literature . conversations generally riveting , humor generally very dark , suspense reaches hitchcockian levels . scott character , who dying leukemia , sinks deeper deeper into depravity his hapless plight , he actually begins seek , rather than fear , death . this very sophisticated , emotionally involving story appeal strongly mature viewers . it never received attention it deserved , ranks among best " undiscovered " movies . i give it my highest recommendation	1
this stunning romance thriller . it breathes like hitchcock . after watching it i went back beginning film when jeweler asked max ( vincent cassel ) which three beautiful rings ( how he described them ) he choose . max think it we find out who he choose end film . he not sure his engagement muriel when he overheard voice his lost love lisa ( monica bellucci ) . there he must find her find out why she left him two years ago without word . he finds clues which may lead him unsuspecting surprise . music camera work excellent you follow characters throughout story keeps you thinking .	1
many us growing up , leonard bernstein * * american music . this excellent , thrilling pbs biography captures essence bernstein . he flamboyant actor podium , but it never seemed forced . his performances seemed intensify music -- he like speaker quot ; spinal tapquot ; went up 11 instead just 10 . watching this , you begin feel music-intoxicated bernstein himself must . this documentary doesn't whitewash his dark side -- substance abuse , ridiculous radical-chic politics , certain predatory sexuality , deep unhappiness struck him middle age ( after he world his feet . ) he turns 70 , you see dissipation written all over his face . but he man great musical gifts who changed american culture , this fast-paced video captures very well	1
not very realistic movie , but very enjoyable . whoopi almost her best . doesn't pluck heart strings like " color purple " , not moving " clara heart " , but certainly showcases her comedic talents . loved " silver box " " tropical fish " comments . some very funny parts require real acting talent . thoroughly enjoyable film best enjoyed someone watch it you .	-1

there really not much i add plotwise other excellent reviews here amazon . what i say though helena bonham carter often referred " queen costume dramas " which unfortunately pigeonholed her into some kind one dimensional charicature herself some eyes . well .... it henry james ' wings dove ( one better james " novel adaptations screen ) under very able direction iain softley where " mrs. tim burton " blossoms shows she pair eyes express complete range emotions without saying word . ( didn't norma desmond , great silent screen star sunset boulevard say , " we didn't words ... we said it our eyes ! " ? ) . though wings dove certainly fairly engaging story it own right ( it melodrama certainly follows some formulas ) , it miss bonham carter beyond-admirable performance makes this beautifully filmed streets canals venice tragic love triangle really worth watching alone . some actresses so fit bill their characters ( i am reminded meryl streep sophie choice fernanda montenegro central station , currently helen mirren queen)that ever consider remake down line some director would mean outdo what already perfection . bonham carter hit absolute career defining moment this film . here she not ingenue 1983 room view , but full come-of-age bonifide star who received both nominations hollywood foreign press academy . she deserved every bit those accolades role kate , wings dove really kate story anyway . supporting cast , linus roach more than suitable merton plays well opposite miss carter . i , personally , never found parts americans played alison elliot elizabeth mcgovern anything all . i truly feel miss elliot fails capture necessary fragility/emerging sexual woman role any kind true conviction millie theale . miss mcgovern , part limited best , but there not much there delivery nor look	-1

perhaps it success other , recent randolph scott westerns released this past year dvd , but now warner brothers releasing very reasonably priced triple-headers two 3-film packs classic scott westerns 1950s , it indeed great news fans classic " little " western , randolph scott , who many ways epitomized western star 1940s ' 50s . these three titles purchased together three more set pitance . although warner scotts not generally superior columbia products , they still superior westerns very entertaining , filled action kind dramatic adventure so treasured fans genre . several , including colt . 45 , fort worth , riding shotgun , very good . here hoping warner release carson city ( one best early 50s ) , sugarfoot , bounty hunter ... if they it , westbound , one seven budd boetticher directed scott films . i'd even enjoy seeing much-maligned shoot-out medicine bend ( young james garner) ! thanks , warner brothers	1

top fact it solidified steve mcqueen " king cool action " 1970 1960 . it always best not forget his more challenging films so much character development intimacy like papillon . i only wish this dvd more extras got better special edition treatment than it , but we all can't winners . nearly all mcqueen films got treatment past year or so , including my favorite bullitt . dustin hoffman early career proves impossible top graduate , straw dogs this well . i simply can't stress enough how great this movie , upon first view many years ago , i couldnt take my eyes off screen . sentiment still very much same i ability watch this film now over over it still hits me exact same way	1
i came into stuart gordon " king ants " expecting some weird blend science fiction horror . just look title . doesn't scream sci-fi/horror ? considering gordon other features almost always reside deep well blood soaked cinema , one could safely assume this picture would cover familiar ground . here guy who made films like " re-animator , " " castle freak , " remake " pit pendulum , " h.p. lovecraft adaptations " dagon " " beyond , " christopher lambert sci-fi vehicle " fortress . " i think it safe assume " king ants " should fall within these parameters , right ? boy , i wrong ! title " king ants " couldn't more misleading describing themes this movie actually covers . there no king , far i tell . there no ants , although they would quite difficult see unless they mutant ants stood fifty feet tall . instead , gordon gives us film adapted book charlie higson , film deals bad deal gone wrong subsequent bloody revenge wreaked upon principals unassuming housepainter who literally wrong place wrong time . well , least gordon penchant blood soaked cinema remains firm this project . sean crawley ( chris mckenna ) your average young guy just trying get housepainter when opportunity comes knocking one day form portly duke ( george wendt ) . two men strike up friendly rapport while working house , duke promptly invites his new friend meet most important individual . this person powerful construction contractor named ray mathews ( daniel baldwin ) , beefy thug love golf hatred certain accountant down city hall called eric gatley ( ron livingstone ) . mathews offers our boy sean specific sum money if he'll simply follow gatley around town report back his movements . it seems ray involved several shady schemes , schemes meaning kickbacks projects , eric nosing around hope saving city some money sending mathews slammer . crawley , always lookout few extra bucks , sees no harm tailing suburbanite . he heads over gatley home start his mission , can't help but notice accountant incredibly gorgeous wife . sean spends some time doing job reports back mathews . then something ominous happens . ray sean heart heart while mathews liberally gulps firewater . contractor seems indicate something " bad " should happen eric gatley , if something " bad " happens , big payoff might cards whoever carries out dirty deed . least this how crawley interprets conversation . next day he follows gatley home murders guy particularly brutal , bloody manner . then he turns up seeking payment mathews , but ray expresses anger what happened . he claims authorities all over him because they think he gatley bumped off . not only he refuse hand over cash , he tells crawley get lost . sean not sort chap take no answer , his persistent efforts get what owed him results kidnapping series extraordinarily brutal tortures inflicted upon him mathews , duke , few other stooges . much their everlasting detriment , ray company fail kill their former flunky . sean escapes , help most unlikeliest allies , returns full health goal seeking revenge his tormentors . end . i left bunch particulars out order not spoil film , but " king ants " really simple above summary . wronged man seeks revenge . that it nutshell . hands capable stuart gordon , however , movie manages entertain thanks number exploitative factors . first presence kari wuhrer , brunette movie actress who plays eric gatley wife susan here . through most unusual circumstances , she ends up offering help her husband murderer . her role also requires her some acrobatics her birthday suit this viewer greatly appreciated . second , gordon doesn't shy away violence . we've got golf club repeatedly hitting head , pools blood , refrigerator used murder weapon , gory showdown results all sorts ghastly indecencies . " king ants " contains more than enough bloodshed satiate avid gorehound . third , finally , gordon isn't above throwing few scenes weirdness just keep audience off balance . check out hallucination crawley experiences during his kidnapping . what heck thing all ? who knows , but it entertaining appropriately kooky . " king ants " sort category all itself . it doesn't really fit into field horror , it not entirely home standard revenge flick genre , either . if you like horror you like revenge shoot ' em ups , however , you'll probably enjoy gordon movie . i know i ; i would definitely watch this one again . dvd version film , extras abound . we get trailer , commentary track gordon , wendt , mckenna , lengthy behind scenes feature containing interviews many principal players . this short documentary interesting number ways , such learning it george wendt who played big role bringing this movie fruition . give " king ants " go if you get chance . it worth watching .	-1
" night heaven " opened 1983 terrible reviews even worse box office . it mainstay ten worst lists everywhere . it dubbed " flashdunce " after hit movie year . really , its not bad . insubstantial , yes . ill-conceived , yes . entertaining ? quite . lesley anne warren plays faye , speech professor local community college who marital problems . her husband whitney ( robert logan ) , emotionally stunted inventor , seemingly lost interest her she becoming depressed when her sister patsy ( deborah rush ) takes her out friends local strip club . there , faye surprised club star stripper , ricky rocket ( christopher atkins ) , same cocky student she just flunked her class . when he sees her audience , ricky virtual lapdance her , it isn't long before they plunged into affair . actually , there probably very good , serious film buried somewhere writer joan tewkesbury original script , which glossily directed oscar-winner john . avildsen , who went this fiasco " karate kid " . unfortunately , casting christopher atkins what obviously originally supporting role hurts film considerably . cast after his breakthrough role " blue lagoon " , atkins received star billing all film pre-release publicity . but warren logan lead characters , most screen time obviously main relationship film . this caused film quite obviously heavily reedited emphasize atkins character , who total jerk , completely amoral unlikable , poorly played one worst actors ever spit out hollywood system . this sinks film faster than " titanic " . result , what should serious examination marriage crossroads becomes smarmy sex-comedy/marital drama which disparate elements just don't fit . note brief 80 minute running time . this one film which i wish could reedited director cut , so we see what writer director original intent . instead , we forever saddled studio botched reedit . spite all this , " night heaven " remains entertaining easy watch . lesley ann warren gives good performance here , although i'm sure this film isn't listed her otherwise stellar resume . robert logan also quite good , although his presence bit eye-opener considering he best-known family films like " wilderness family " this film comes close soft-core porn any major hollywood studio film recent decades . deborah rush gives able support , there decent performance here actress named sandra beall ricky long-suffering girlfriend slick . late carrie snodgress also couple good scenes ricky mother . unfortunately , atkins ' horrible acting just negates performances everyone around him . it impossible excellent work when person you acting can't act save his life . it makes you appreciate warren work even more . she manages give good performance under circumstances commendable . one note : this film contains one sexiest love scenes i ever seen film , one only three reasons see it . other two ? warren performance bryan adams ' now-classic love them " heaven " , which plays its entirety over opening closing credits . when you take away seven minutes these sequences , leaves 73 minutes story , which makes cuts even more noticeable . " night heaven " one bomb early ' 80 should much better , but remains more entertaining than many much better films era . ** 1/2 ( out *****) ; ** execution ; *** entertainment value	-1

first , allow me clear up widely misunderstood notion . " minotaur " not receive its bad rap solely because it initially aired sci-fi channel . vast number elements , unrelated sci-fi network , contributed this particular disaster . monumental lack competent direction , nonexistent writing , laughable acting , " minotaur " would easily doomed itself failure any cable channel . what particularly troubled me most this film , however , its inexecusable waste two outstanding talents . rutger hauer tony todd . " hitcher " " candyman , " crying out loud ! how these two guys get suckered into throw-away roles they here ? they both deserve so much better ! , uh , not burst anyone bubble , but wasn't minotaur supposedly half man-half bull ? i admit my greek mythology tad bit rusty these days . but i seem remember reading up this specific legend my younger years grammar student . critter this here film seems little out place .

i confess big fan coen brothers , which why i surprised my response this film . cast die , it all makings terrific film . unfortunately , far it gets , cast cannot undo what screenplay seriously flawed , due its inability decide what type film it should . unfortunately , it looks if director could not make up his mind either , producing film neither fish nor fowl . first , i thought it would screwball type comedy , george clooney role would gone cary grant golden age filmmaking . then , it seems take direction altogether , if it supposed romantic comedy dark side or simply satire gone awry . who knows ? coen brothers surely don't . film lacks total surety identity kills it , despite stellar cast . it flop , pure simple . plot line fairly basic one . it slick , greedy grasping , unscrupulous matrimonial attorney ( george clooney ) , kind gives all lawyers bad name , greedy grasping gold digging beauty ( catherine zeta-jones ) , who gives all beautiful women bad name . their paths cross , chase . unfortunately , viewer not give rat behind either one them . there nothing would ingratiate them viewer , due two dimensional , leaden screenplay nowhere which laughs few far . if you die hard coen brothers fan , i am , yourself favor , rather than buy this film , rent it first . you thank me this advice , once you seen this film	-1
" caddyshack " absolute classic -- up there other personal favorites same era ( like " stripes " , " jerk " , " back school " ) . other reviewers noted , cast comedy perfection . rodney dangerfield , chevy chase , ted knight simply couldn't ( never ) better . practically every scene least one quotable line , often not , i find myself rattling off entire exchanges dialogue . one my favorite lines ty " i feel like hundred dollars . " perfect deadpan delivery . this one those rare movies you watch again again again ( sometimes noticing things you never saw before , even after 20 viewings ) . my wife i watch it several times year . dvd doesn't many special features we would liked ( but then again , we're talking film made 1980 ) , but few it fun -- including peek what some actors look like now . must	1
this movie introduced me fred macmurray child . watching silliness laughing harmless fun , all based silly premise . this type movie sunday nights when i kid afterwards various local stations finally new disney channel before they started original programming adding other shows dubious ( but more " hip " ) nature . if you like silly fun whole family , check out this title or any other family movie features fred macmurray , kurt russell , tommy kirk , joe flynn , ken berry , keenan wynn ed wynn , hayley mills , jim dale , dean jones , tim conway , don knotts , robert morse , phil silvers , or mickey rooney . you won't disappointed !!	1
i'm so glad oscars turned out way they this year because no one more worthy receiving statue than martin scorsese . if you ask me , he should get one his every endeavor there never more consistent director genius history movies -- my biased opinion . his artistic integrity absolute body his oeuvre magnificent . i'm not sure how anyone else could made his landmark successes -- goodfellas , casino , taxi driver gangs new york -- any better . even secondary works like mean streets departed close perfect . this documentary , they go right primary sources , actors who worked him , means describing him . views jodie foster , paul newman , robert de niro , willem dafoe , joe pesci all recorded . i also liked scorsese insight music his movies separate character itself . i never considered before .	1
i saw this tv when it came out . i'm sure it made-for-tv movie , it should stopped there . i remember looking forward seeing it , then totally bummed out . i wasn't expecting it good original , but geeze , it shouldn't allowed same name or main character . totally different plot , totally corny . this made chick flick ? someone mentioned what his names blue eye , woman peril . if i remember he drive through utah idaho plays chicken cops . no cop going play chicken ! why doesn't he buy freakin ' plane ticket ? instead he tries kill himself so his wife nobody . arrggh	-1
not worth money . ads tv web compelling , but ultimately deceptive . these dvds each contain few events drag ever . unlike ads which suggest you'll see great variety events people , actual dvds contain same few girls repeatedly doing same thing . very disappointing	-1

mel gibson took quite risk when he directed starred this affecting , poignant look male bonding . he surrendered his movie-star looks plays deformed man , whose biggest " action " scene holding back his barking dog . nonetheless , man without face triumph gibson ; it moving , thoughtful examination prejudice , love growing up . he matched his performance stunning debut nick stahl ( who not equaled this performance subsequently ) . stahl perfect young boy whose need true father figure propels him seek gibson guidance preparing his acceptance into boarding school . usually daft margaret whitton offers understated effective performance his oft-married mother gaby hoffman good his young stepsister . although much smaller scope than many gibson subsequent films , i found man without face much more enjoyable than bombastic braveheart , it underappreciated achievement gibson career .	1

shrek ( mike myers ) ugly green ogre who only likes life when he alone . naturally , he rather upset when his swamp invaded all kinds magical creatures . seems lord farquaad ( john lithgow ) trying create perfect kingdom . everyone knows you can't perfect kingdom magical creatures around . but shrek not going take this lightly . setting out talking donkey ( eddie murphy ) , he goes meet lord farquaad demand his swamp back . but farquaad other ideas . he looking someone go quest him . mission , rescue princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) fire breathing dragon . so he makes deal shrek - rescue girl , he his swamp back . naturally , shrek agrees deal . but fiona not all what shrek thought she'd like . she secret . all this makes perfect fractured fairytale . this computer animated movie riot . it takes many fairytale conventions turns them their ear . there also lots great small gags , usually expense classic story . disney . katzenberg obviously feels need get back his ex-employer . but , disney fanatic i am , i must admit some those jokes my favorites . way , movie develops great heart well subtly slips message loving people who they . animation , while bit rough " extras " wonderful main characters . only problem movie , it big one , crude humor . shrek ogre . we get it . fortunately , these jokes lessen movie progresses . there few jokes questionable young children well . course , most them probably won't get many jokes anyway . this fairytale adults . fun one	-1
two 80 " what lies beneath surface sea " sci-fi flicks ( leviathan other ) this one very attractive male cast . greg evigan fun watch wet not mention matt mccoy delicious blue eyes . story lack luster female characters less than 2 dimensional , they 1 dimensional if that even possible creature wasn't near menacing leviathan beastie . it like goofy cockroach . overall though it still fun flick watch , but really only appeal lovers underwater suspense horror flicks , which kind niche thing best	-1
i thoroughly entertained this 4-dvd set , basically because dyn-o-mutt character i always laughed my you know what off . his malfunctions coupled blue falcon seriousness my opinion what make series hilarious . lots credit goes vocal delivery gary owens who spite ridiculous situations his character put through thanks " dog wonder " , watching blue falcon slow burn malfunctions dynomutt then hearing him call his side-kick " dog blunder " , etc etc . well , me it funny but my sense humor off wall anyway . frank welker voices dynomutt . scooby side collection , i enjoyed programs ... pure nostalgia reasons if nothing else , scooby-dum makes appearance well . i give dvd set 4 stars because some same reasons discussed other reviews . this complete collection episodes aired under banner " scooby-doo/dynomutt hour " best my knowlege . however , mumbley , if i'm not mistaken , later added show title well later when several additional blue falcon-dynomutt scooby shorts produced { not full half-hour episodes , 7-8 minute shorts } . each dvd there contains menu selections course . however only one disc provides bonus material ... dvd #4 ... side 2 . i also search each dvd find masterpiece segment , which only runs little over 7 minutes , giving spotlight wonderful voice actors cartoon ... including what could one don messick last interviews early-mid ' 90s . clip don isn't dated it not certain when he ... he passed away 1997 so it safe say it before 1997 . frank welker shows us his vocal tricks ... he portrayed both fred dynomutt series ... oh , casey kasem also featured . anyone ears tell casey voice shaggy plus few cops criminals { including swamp rat one episodes } . casey , don , frank there nicole jaffe { velma } heather north { daphne } gary owens { blue falcon } . gary also narrates segment bonus selections side 2 dvd #4 recalling history scooby , which includes appearances fred silverman one half ruby-spears team created program . whole , nostalgia , i give dvd set 4 stars . like others said , it would've nice official opening credits theme songs here .	-1

well , what i say ? i'm usually not very picky " seamonster " -movies ( especially when there shark involved ) . though it didn't surprise me , " red water " ( hm ..! ) , whatever you don't believe cover dvd . shark (!) looks frightening , looks great white . shark this movie however bull shark , very " plastic " non-hollywood-sence . there plenty shark " red water " , some reviewers here mean you hardly see shark , but that not problem . problem you see shark too many times , mentioned ; it not much look ! effects (?) something jaws 3 4 , explains lot if you familiar those . acting what you'd expect b-movie , ok its ' best , script paperthin -but it could've more " watchable " if " more story , less shark " . i doubt i watch " red water " again . b-movies like " anacondas " " lake placid " , well , least effects somewhat believable . i didn't expect much , but got less ...	-1
