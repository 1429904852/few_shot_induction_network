" ... minus several million good thinking ... " - zaphod beeblebrox , hitchhiker guide galaxythe above quote ( score i've assigned this book ) aren't reference text or author , but publishers . why anyone brains sea urchin would cross professor hawking they seem beyond me . briefly , save your money buy illustrated brief history time instead theory everything , even if you're compulsive hawking completist . alert readers should notice hawking doesn't hold copyright theory everything , attempted block its publication . it originally titled cambridge lectures : life works , appears drawn some recordings lectures given professor years ago . ( see professor web site details . ) " vanilla " ( i.e. , not illustrated ) theory everything consists introduction , seven lectures , index , without * any * illustrations or diagrams . out curiosity , i compared library copy it illustrated brief history time . unless otherwise noted , each 7 lectures corresponds chapter same name brief history , some segments only slightly different paragraphing punctuation ( occasionally kind spelling errors creep when one transcribes audio narration text , if i may speculate cause ) . i don't understand why anyone would prefer less polished text theory everything illustrated brief history time , which not only updates new areas research , but revised rearranged explain things more gently layperson . " ideas universe " essentially extract " our picture universe " , first chapter brief history , one sentence worth drift per paragraph . brief history version " expanding universe " more gradual introduction methods measuring distances nearby stars , explains technical terms may unfamiliar non-scientist , such luminosity . theory everything really shows its age " black holes " when compared brief history , hawking not idle area over years . illustrated edition brief history fair bit interesting material added " black holes " , especially regarding cosmic censorship naked singularities ( hawking made few * more * bets subject preskill thorne , although he paid off cygnus x-1 wager ) . " black holes ain't so black " lacks major blocks clarification/explanation added hawking version brief history . brief history version " origin fate universe " goes into more detail : kinds particles predicted come out big bang , what sort results we'd expect see today if predictions hold , scientists who first put forward these theories . brief history also contains much longer version " open questions " section , leading more gradually up discussion guth development inflationary model . " direction time " corresponds brief history " arrow time " ( which worth picking up just picture keeper u.s. cesium clock ) . brief history goes into more detailed examples explain what hawking means psychological arrow time , simplest kind " computer " : abacus . " theory everything " mainly corresponds brief history more modestly titled " unification physics " , which much more up date ( string theories still covered , but lot more work area over years ) . tail end lecture corresponds ending brief history " conclusion " . -- summary , this interesting stuff , but illustrated brief history time it better	-1

this book so boring i could barely stand it . fact , i abandon ship halfway through . main character kind interesting , two kids , but story itself so slow-paced characters can't carry book . i am huge reader i count one hand times i've quit book midway , but this one just couldn't hold my interest . i found myself daydreaming everytime i tried read it . writing over top ... author sounds if she writing try get award rather than tell story . pretentious readers may try act like they enjoyed this mess , but don't believe them . one worst books i've ever read	-1

this marvelous volume enjoyed book photography lovers alike . object its own right it exhibits level refinement conception execution become rare our age mass-produced books . course , there many specialist photobook publishers but they seem focus exclusively print quality increase perceived value their publications , whilst neglecting vital contribution design book overall appearance ( desirability ) . phaidon-volume , exquisitely judged rhythm layout typography complement vivid reproductions vintage photobook material into very exciting whole . sure , care spent production this book not gratuitous . contrary , it statement reinforces basic conceptual tenets held badger parr . introductory pages we learn not every any book conceived around collection photographs merits included class " photobooks " . photobook - badger parr understand it - more than just sum its parts : pictures , words , design , choice subject all contribute something which transcends meaning photographic portfolio . this all illuminating one could certainly say " photobook " instructive example this synergy various elements . however , i wished editorial team would left it . i think badger parr moving onto much more controversial ground when they hold forth emblematic photobook kind dramatic event , " comparable piece sculpture , play or film " which individual photographs lose their own character things themselves . apart theoretically doubtful , i believe this criterion simply too stringent many vintage photobooks featured this survey not comply it . example , many early books photo albums true sense word : bound collections original prints glued onto white pages . similarly , it difficult see some modernist books - such erhardt " das watt " or mendelsohn " amerika " - anything more than expertly produced photographic portfolio . each these examples there coherence , but it not derive some kind dramatic or narrative logic . it simply unity style which holds photobook together . positioning photobook " novel film " , therefore , raises more questions than it provides us answers . it doesn't really help make sense " ragged sprawling subject , more than its fair share anomalies " . it perhaps more useful investigate how badger parr tried organise their material within confines this volume ( next ) . they seem relied three different lines thought . first chronological ( it history after all ) . survey starts very first publications , early history photography end section " photobook modern life " . this sense , book studied remarkably lively varied panorama how photographers engaged their craft over last 150 years . second organising principle geographical : some individual chapters focus distinct area cultural production ( us , europe japan ; next volume features chapter " worldwide photobook " ) . finally , there " intention " structuring element . photobooks produced serve variety purposes : tell story , tell non-story ( stream-of-consciousness-like books ) , non-tell story ( deconstruct ) , document , persuade , etc . indeed , valuable photobook even limit itself simply showing . most chapters two volumes put some kind " intention " center discussion . i think badger parr conception their own book certain extent odds their conceptual emphasis dramatic nature photobooks . if there drama " photobook " , it mediated words accompany various chapters , not visuals . other words : it conceptual not photographic narrative unfolds . regards visuals , curiously enough daring use white space drop shadows around book page reproductions really make them stand out preciously unique . leafing through book akin walking carefully presented museum exhibits . this sense , " photobook " clearly `shows ' , therefore pulls us away dramatic sweep history . despite these theoretical misgivings there not shade doubt my mind this book deserves five stars . it fabulous book i look forward keen anticipation second final volume .	1

i imagine my mind what it would like coffee luis borges sunday afternoon . borges would wearing suit little cakes hand , cane leaning his armrest , if nothing out ordinary occur . labyrinths useful first book kick off lifetime investigation into borges ' writings . borges truly original author much his intent his achieving it . not quite magic realist , not quite existentialist nor kafkan : no one borges ' equal taking established assumptions turning them into curious , elaborate , eruditely-supported flashing crossroads defy simplification . even most unassuming essays like " fearful sphere pascal , " subtle historical resketching , characteristically erudite , yet sticky complicate subject irresistibly your first reading onward . prickly thorns reach out your existing education subject designed flesh out glaring inconsistencies you read subjec t.t he garden forking paths example prime borges storytelling work . story itself ruse . first reading-through not time you affected most borges , but rather only after you put book down , when borges ' physics begin gnaw your world compact , necessary daily conveniences , even 2005 when we really ought intimately familiar his universe now . i think ultimately borges sets tiny mind bombs set detonate exactly time you seek superimpose newtonian universe upon one his stories , ultimately , later , when you seek superimpose order upon your own human experience . entrance seems same , but it clearly moved time you exit story . you become part puzzle , bedazzling signature borges , his unassailable virtue . everything solid universe daily lived experience becomes compost peacefully unsettled , it originally , before we came fix it up like morticians just before funeral .	1

david mills ' " atheist universe " lucid presentation rationalist viewpoint nature our world how it explained without resorting mysticism unprovable assertions supreme . it , mills carefully lays out reasons why we needn't assume existence god ( or gods ) understand natural phenomena , demolishes numerous assertions teachings religious spiritualist propagandists . his primary target christian fundamentalism , but he makes it clear his critique religious beliefs equally applicable other faiths well . places , his explanations get bit technical , but he fine job demolishing pseudo-scientific mumbo-jumbo used " intelligent design " crowd their fellow travelers . ( chapter internet porn , however , seems out place . yes , biggest porn-bashers often religious conservatives -- but so what ? what validity atheist viewpoint ? )one thing i particularly enjoyed numerous quotes past present thinkers mills includes throughout book . among those he cites albert einstein , thomas jefferson , thomas edison mark twain - numerous others whose writings i long admired . " atheist universe " probably won't convert many diehard religious believers , but if you all open-minded , qualms endless barrage religiosity engulfing america today , this book well worth buying reading	1

laurence bergreen " over edge world " great example how narrative history should written . he takes very interesting but overlooked story breathes life into it . most history books magellan first circumnavigation merits few sentences or paragraphs , but brief mention conceals rich story underneath . magellan portuguese man who sailed under spanish flag , five ships began voyage , only one completed circumnavigation . magellan died during voyage , but not before facing two mutinies countless other hazards . bergreen excellent job telling this story . he explains nautical terms shipboard conditions early 16th century , he puts story into its proper political cultural context - time when inquisition still powerful force spain age exploration changing europe . my primary criticism book should many more maps ; it only included one map ( displayed twice ) entire world inside each cover . my only other criticism , others pointed out reviews , bergreen sometimes seems not understand -- or explain -- concepts like international date line . this history book reads like novel . bergreen brings out human suffering , triumph , failings during this voyage . it great read anyone any interest history .	1

i consider dr. radin man takes lot heat his experiments beliefs . whether or not you agree him , i think this book shows dr. radin didn't come conclusion psi phenomenon real overnight . he spent years investigating subtle aspects " psi phenomena " , analyzed large bodies this type experimental research , learned implement numerous statistical techniques . i not consider him " quack " . dean radin dedicated scientist . whether or not he misguided scientist depends upon your point view . i am not convinced he misguided . this book made me open investigating more learning more before i draw any conclusions . i simply am not sure what believe . dean radin very expressive easy read writing style . addition , he uncanny ability explain ins outs statistics utilizing simple analogies . me , this resulted book i able read digest very rapidly . i decided give book 5 stars all above reasons . potential psi research criticisms addressed reasonably well dr. radin include : 1 ) file drawer problem2 ) problem fraud3 ) statistical significance results ( ie . effect size)4 ) replicability results5 ) use meta-analysis6 ) sensory leakage7 ) randomization teststhere one area criticism i wish addressed more thoroughly : fair amount skepticism psi phenomena appears stem fact so much evidence based " statistical deviations " . granted , ( ) values important , but isn't there even one form psi captured upon demand ? not one ? how psi effect looked tangibly ? where ? i understand dr. radin point psi phenomena inherently complex , but there least one truly tangible demonstration its effects . after all , parapsychology very broad field inquiry . consider , instance , physicists actually conduct quantum teleportation experiment . it observed . nobody deny it anymore . enough effort , it visibly reproduced . psychologists give rat certain narcotic observe its unusual behavior . chemists form compounds , you view them microscope . i mean there come point where you actually isolate least one aspect phenomenon make it tangible . statistics inherently complex there so many confounding factors it easy skeptics dismiss results one way or . instance , i feel parapsychologists need find way create tangible demonstration psychokinesis so skeptics truly lost words . not tangible statistics , i mean truly tangible . personally , i would elated if any following happened : 1 ) large group psychics able bend piece metal even millionth inch under very tightly guarded conditions , experiment designed monitored deeply affirmed skeptics . psychics could try this many times they wanted until they produced effect . surely psychics could overcome negative experimenter effect , least once , given unlimited number trials ? 2 ) large group psychics able move very specific small electronic gadget certain small distance or alter very specific bit information while under extremely controlled circumstances . experiment would monitored skeptics . psychics could attempt this many times they wanted until they made it happen . i am confused why this type irrefutable evidence doesn't exist . or it exist , skeptics still denounce results ? am i missing something here ? there some visible , tangible , irrefutable evidence mainstream science would forced accept . i doubt mainstream science would reject such evidence . without directly isolating effect , making it tangible , skeptics always play hardball . right ?

i lived el salvador now over eight years . visit el salvador three days continue make profit those three days -past- seems completely immoral me , especially since book remains print continues influence world opinion el salvador . i find this completely unfair . would it possible joan or oliver or anyone else enjoyed income events 20+ years ago come back revise their assesment ? it would probably cost them all two or three thousand dollars trip , but course , it would stop thousand if not million dollars sales these recollections which wish fullfilling fantasies begin . all el salvador suffered during this time , why perpetuate suffering ? what any three days any given city north america ? could'nt " glass half empty " scenario drawn horrify any sensible person every wanting visit there , simply selectively clipping daily paper ? i think so .	1

those who skeptical just anything coming llewellyn , i say , if they continue release extremely high caliber material like christopher penczak temple witchcraft series , then they fully redeem themselves publishers . though i share concerns other reviewers lack separation sets exercises cds , after listening several tracks i now believe exercises recorded way specific reason . series meditations visualizations , recorded , afforded me rich experience helped calm my mind increase my focus within first three days receiving set ! example , after initial relaxation counting-down induction , first " set " takes you through 3 ( or four ? ) sets simple visualization exercises . afterwards , he counts you up meditation state full awareness grounds you light chakra sweep clearing affirmation . each segment begins ends same calm , balanced safe manner . when i experienced exercises first time , i appreciated he didn't short-change coming-back-to-awareness sequence end each meditation , like some meditation recordings i've heard . if you're considering companion cds books , i would consider this required item purchase books . keep mind , cds companion books--they're not audio version entire text , just exercises , which comes very handy if you don't want work your meditation trance while balancing book your lap . many , many , many blessings mr. penczak his excellent soothing voice , caring warm reading , top-knotch level work this cd all his books . bright blessings	1

read several different translations lysistrata , i report one you select may make all difference your opinion this early comedy . roche translation very vulgar but good footnotes : get ready cockney spartans , however . jack lindsay translation , 1925 ( included bantam edition aristophanes ) seems overly literary comparison original but lacks notes . it reads well , though sounds little old-fashioned . bawdry present but made less direct ; this one spartan dialect scottish . i found parker translation least satisfactory . " hillbilly " dialect he gives spartans painfully overdone , not mention inaccurate , speeches awkward pedestrian . excellent edition overall alan . sommerstein penguin classic " aristophanes : lysistrata other plays . " introduction notes extremely informative , translation itself strikes right note represent aristophanes ' style english .

david mamet one america most respected playwrights . this autobiographical essay jewish situation he writes wild passion outrage hatred jews unjustly subject , flight shame their own jewish identity good part american jewry . he starts out cry , ' world hates jews ' this becomes kind rhythmic chant all through his opening chapter , sense throughout work whole . revealed first shortcoming this work . while it true jews suffered historically hatred persecution most horrible ways , it true this very time historically jewish state israel subject continuous barrage hatred many sources it not true each every person nation hates jews israel . here i fault mamet allowing his rhetoric get best him unknowingly insulting not simply great share his fellow countrymen who actually sympathize allied israel but so many remarkable human beings who ' friends ' jews throughout history . moreover mamet not seem realize when one makes such claim one really work one enemies , one distances implication , friends seems invite others hatred jews . this qualification made i come what i regard strongest point mamet work , his pointing out biased discriminatory treatment state israel not only haters , islamists , neo- nazis , radical left chomskyians , but great share world nations media who continually show bias , discrimination towards jewish state . mamet here provides few recent pieces evidence back up his claim , but perhaps would better he focused present iranian regime talk ' wiping ' israel map- stressed too point this kind unprecedented declaration one u.n. state upon not met worldwide outrage sanction iranian mullah-regime . mamet second major subject assimilated , self- denying apologetic american jews , wicked son his title , who not simply resist jewish belonging but often curry favor others even join chorus hatred against jewish religion , jewish community , state israel . mamet i sense criticizes many what he somewhat misleadingly calls ' apikorsim ' their detachment jewish life , one senses it almost if he trying shame them back jewish belonging . it almost if whole book kind ' teshuvah riff ' which he reaching out assimilated jews urging them abandon their ' inauthenticity ' courageously take new interest pride their jewish identities . mamet celebrates importance ' belonging ' talks how it give greatest pleasure life . here he apparently referring his own return jewish observance kind communal experiences he under tutelage his own spiritual mentor , rabbi finley . here too i think great force passion mamet lead him bit exaggeration , we know nothing more evil than intoxications given mindless group- belonging . any case mamet specific recommendation return real jewish belonging through observance me both commendable incomplete . it not enough i understand it jew today world bound communal religious observance . additional necessity i understand it jewish historical awareness understanding well beyond kind character mamet reveals himself this work . i agree wholeheartedly his call renewed jewish communal belonging , identity contribution but i believe this broader conception ' jewish identity ' than one mamet provides us this work . i think however most important point mamet heart right place . he uses his extraordinary literary talents make not always carefully argued but most often emotionally convincing wake- up call american jews	1

( this part added 1952 ) . me book really took story two halves . first half book , parts 1 2 , bulk theory really laid out . it slow going it extremely depth but i highly recommend you stick it this pays off second half book ! part 3 mises really starts putting flesh onto theory when we get into money banking proper discussion demand money , credit , fiduciary paper , rate interest etc . but towards end chapters 19 20 things get much more interesting equilibrium rates interest discussed detail he finally talks gold , gold standard banking freedom . part 4 where my heart lies . here we discussion principles sound money versus contemporary currency systems . there then excellent discourse return sound money , ie classical gold standard . second half this wonderful book certainly flowed better me , but may also just because i am more investment manager/trader less economist ! you feel like you mises teaching you fine detail he left no stone unturned your understanding . mises doesn't read easily prose rothbard but not detract excellence material . superb ! it really truly outstanding work if not best book ever written subject , it surely very least , one very best , such certainly " must-read " !!! this wonderful , beautifully bound , classic absolute " steal " $20 . i still cannot believe it sold so little . my recommendation buy it while it still available this beautiful hardbound edition ! enjoy	1

his first novel , julian fellowes ( gosford park-screenwriting fame ) created gift all anglophiles who fascinated wealth , title , privilege . everyone who eagerly consumes british television , film , books ; everyone who ever dreamed owning english country estate part aristocracy , fellowes " dishes dirt " fictional form , meticulously describing how other " half " lives , particularly how they go delineating who who not part their tribe . fact , mr. fellowes goes into such careful detail social mores upper crust times it drags down narrative pace . firs t-t ime novelist i think fellowes falls into trap doing too much " telling " not enough " showing " . problem this book ending not feel " piece " everything went before . overall tone novel more wharton than wodehouse , but ending more wodehouse than wharton . this would five-star book if tone consistent beginning end . my final issue novel fellowes ' habit sprinkling text french phrases , which begins feel like he consciously aligning himself upper crust he describing distancing himself his more plebeian audience . this gets bit tiresome novel end . outlined what i feel problems novel , i point out i nevertheless enjoyed it . there voyeuristic appeal reading foibles class most us never rub shoulders , there wryly amusing moments sprinkled throughout . pace drags times , but you find yourself wanting see how it all works out end . i look forward reading future novels mr. fellowes	1

let freedom ring , sean hannity sends out subliminal message he his writing truth , justice , american way . just title represents everything true good him america . his five-star reviewers his message reinforces their pre-conceived beliefs hannity words validation those beliefs . if this written ghost writer , he should withheld payment . if it wasn't written ghostwriter , hannity should one his next attempt literary hyperbole . first chapter written maudlin , " those-were-the-good-old-days " wistfulness his immigrant grandfather who he describes honest man integrity , believer american dream . but before you say " erin go braugh " he talking courage george . bush standing up terrorism . exactly how g.w. , he doesn't elaborate . how he goes grandfather dubbya bit magic . hannity next trick impugn clinton gore soft terrorism . his source this , all people , dick morris who knew clintons now works fox republican advocacy network . he quotes morris who makes such vague statements " it seemed they afraid talking terrorism , " or " they seemed indifferent terrorism . " these " morris mind-reads " conjectural , but hannity uses them , which he impunity . let take closer look hannity unimpeachable source moment . it dick morris who quit clintons shortly after second election . it morris who penchant streetwalkers , some jail time , entered alcohol rehab . you'd think sh could find better source if he expects freedom ring ! but , hannity doesn't skip beat . he points out how democrats such senators kerry daschle voted against certain defense-spending bills . what he neglects inform his readers reasons they because riders attached bills , or number republicans who also voted against same bills , or many defense bills kerry daschle vote . he never once advises his reader defense spending programs killed dick cheney when he secretary defense . such deception called propaganda . propaganda something hannity no compunction using here . this he continuing tell tale long since debunked . namely , it story president clinton offered osama bin laden sudanese government . again , it what he doesn't say misdirects reader . sudan made offer hope economic sanctions against them slave-trading , lifted . however , fbi determined sudanese playing us because they neither ability nor intent handing over bin laden . sudanese also made offer saudi arabia , but saudis revoked bin laden citizenship , refused take him . benjamin franklin said " statistics liar . " hannity uses charts same purpose . he shows how under reagan , army bought over 500 tanks . under clinton , army bought none . this leads one assumption clinton nothing services . he doesn't mention army buys tanks , not presidents . he doesn't mention army all tanks they needed armored warfare against soviet union never came . he doesn't mention army began changing its warfare strategies which would include more transportable fighting vehicles . grateful hannity cannot rewrite famous works literature he attempts history . if he could , instead seeing dead captain ahab killed whale " moby dick , " we might just see grinning captain standing next tethered whale caption : " i caught fish this big ! " there something very fishy his facts , his historical parallels which aren't parallel , what he chooses tell you , what he chooses leave out . this book , he tells whale-sized whoppers !	-1

brothers karamazov easily one greatest books ever written . unlike crime punishment -- which i also love -- brothers karamazov more plot-drive more easily digested . large book , it nonetheless full great writing , intense philosophical debate , beautifully-crafted chapters .

i hadn't read " sword shannara " 20 years . many reviewers said it borrows heavily tolkien . but i don't think brooks would argue point . point , it pretty good story it entertains which what it supposed . brooks uses conversation sparingly book it full really long paragraphs . i think later books he gets more away this style , but it noticable this book . it didn't bother me but it might others . all all good read fantasy fans .	1
i originally read this novel , its continuation fall hyperion , early 90 shortly after discovering it won hugo award . it engrossing read , i finished it satisfied quality hugo award winners time , then continued reading subsequent award winners . so here it some 15 years or so later , i'm re-reading it after hearing others rave it ( i've people exclaim me bus poland even ) , discover it now four-book series , status dune its generation 25 years or so ago . ( so if 25 year cycle continues , then it only 8 years or so until next dune/hyperion sci-fi novel . ) hyperion published before ubiquitous presence internet . just give idea what it like then , it time logging into internet very first time one life conversations such : `ok first type http ' , `why ' , `just it make sure it http not hhtp or htpp ok then type colon backslash backslash make sure it backslash not forward slash ' , `a what-slash what there two types slashes ... who thinks these things ' , `and make sure you type two backslashes ' , `why two why not three or four ' , `just type it ' , `ok now type three w ' , `oh so * now * we type three continuous characters ' . yes , it amusing time . so this book published before most these conversational interactions , so world web novel takes new meaning re-reading . terms like fatline could taken apple use `fat ' software codes written compatible their older hardware their newer power-pc-chip hardware incorporated into their computers late 80 . so simmons really cutting edge things when he published this novel . like dune , this sweeping epic novel part sweeping epic series . others commented , hyperion/fall hyperion ( foh ) not separate books , they one book split down middle published separately . means it really 1000 page novel . may seem daunting , but serious reader sf , you'll want read this , more importantly it hard believe you wouldn't enjoy reading this . there'll point your life , if not already , where additional $8 insignificant time it takes read this precious , so if you time now then now time . there some novels seem more meaning when read some point one life . this novel me personally takes more meaning now i advanced my career . i identify many characters ; their professionalism , occasion disillusionment , screw-ups , achievements . there things this novel sticks you through years . definitely shrike . ( shrike way actual bird impales worms it caught upon thorns such . ) also ending fall hyperion i remember . ending hyperion/foh , simmons comment destruction maui-covenant , not military action , but tourists `smelling suntan lotion cannibas ' , simmons disillusioned effect quick far ranging travel places unique status human-masses eventual erosion what made location unique . ending he writes certainly work his futuristic universe , but he suggesting parallel event ours ? it we should remove jet engines our collective consciousness' ? this bold comment possible overpopulation our planet , now 6 or 7 or 8.4 billion this time ? this comment this now almost untouchable subject ( overpopulation ) , considerable population increases foreseen not united states or europe but rather asian continent such cities lagos . well maybe not ; maybe it what within united states itself , its hideously ugly ubiquitous strip malls within short distance any region physical beauty . although it unlikely anything change , it may not bad thing hope . considering ending hyperion/foh epic , this may point what he written . 482 pages , published 1989 , 4-1/2 star	1

william cleveland " history modern middle east " without doubt essential book anyone interested or studying middle east history . cleveland presents history region late ottoman empire through more recent struggles dominating airwaves - this most important thing - explains what earth stake . this particularly important thing middle east history , some alliances divisions different groups somewhat arcane beginner . unlike many books covering history region , cleveland writes eminently readable manner . while some readers astonished lack diacritics like , this serves purpose communicating his information much more clearly . his analysis sense history spot-on . whether writing defeat ottoman empire or land-rights struggle palestinians israelis , cleveland presents facts clearly wry sense humour times - particularly his discussion iran modernising drive . cleveland also eye anecdote illuminating personality , which greatly improves his abilities writer . if there one problem lot contemporary middle east scholarship , it reliance dry historical record expense character sketch . if there one criticism which could made this work , it cleveland sometimes expects little more background knowledge his readers than perhaps he should . already interest this field , i not suffer too much this expectation , although absolute beginner might some problems . said , this book i highly recommend anyone keen learn genesis region which - better or worse - looks though it news headlines many years come . after all , winston churchill ( man who not come up roses history this region ) once said , those who not understand history doomed repeat it . arguably , this more true middle east than anywhere else earth	1

i thought idea each author write different chapter great idea , however after reading this book i extremely disappointed . each author clearly their own vision how this story should develop , but they not all same vision making this novel very confusing . there way too many characters it seems even up end new ones added . there no main characters you engaged their lives . it just mess . chapters 11 12 well developed flowed together nicely if those two authors understood each other . last chapter , well it different twist plot almost every chapter . it literally over . never entire book characters introduced suspects . it all just bunch victims no real villains so authors seemed feel need create more characters then try tie story up weak ending . this book not even worth checking out library . it just painful read . i hate say when there so many good authors collaborating this novel , but perhaps there too many not enough unity . don't waste your money this one	1

john kelly written very complete text possible origin geographical course black plague took it swept through europe middle ages . while covering plague detail , kelly book contains much , much more information than romping ' yersinia pestis ' bacillus . kelly includes lessons history , map study both possible probable courses plague took its journey . i found map quite helpful , book interesting enough i've brushed up my geography now well . kelly includes tales kings , monks , priests , surgeons , wide-spread anti-semitism movement , great famine 1315 . despite rich prose , well written layman language , book remains dry times . flow timeline interrupted lot because kelly tends tell tale region rather than timeline , though two eventually meet shake hands . chapter ten , " god first love " took left turn went off its own into history jewish persecution rather than plague travels , not necessarily boring but enough off topic make me lose interest . while jews seemed unduly persecuted plague times , i question dedication entire chapter jewish history book . pestis . sheer volume information ' great mortality ' makes it one most informative books i've read middle ages , much less plague bacillus , but it also creates more difficult read . this might not book you looking if you wish skim surface black plague history . ' great mortality ' more like diving into deep water than gleaning field . kelly book heavy information , including footnotes , full notes/bibliography section , index . but , its also filled enough imagination intrigue maintain high level interest subject , even laymen . if you any interest plague or even functioning middle ages during adverse conditions such famine or plague , then definitely pick up copy ' great mortality ' . enjoy !	1

" ... so when his reasons making pledge no longer operrative . " we live era high definition television , internet , fast cars , space travel when change word day everything seems become outdated before tomorrow arrives , then you come accross book like this ... you realise there something our nature not changed much . i read book disbelief , amazed how contemporary this text despite fact niccolo machiavelli wrote this book five hundred years ago . machiavelli wrote this book after losing high powered position florentine state . it believed he wrote book 1513 , or least he started working book year . you read text i quoted title my review you cannot escape thought how well applies today politics - any country . quote captures essence book , political manifesto applied practice hundred years later richellieu , creator " raison d'etat " concept . machiavelli focused stating principles acquiring sustaining political power italy . his belief true leader person political abilities , fortune military skills . while sifting through history find examples support his organisation various power systems , machiavelli uses his sharp observations discuss human nature attach them methodically arsenal skills successful prince needs master . thus book becomes something used debate history , politics , human nature , sociology or i dare say economics . this book excellent material people deep belief humans bad they managed mainly through fear : " this said generality men : they ungrateful , fickle , dissembling , anxious flee danger , covetous gain . so long you promote their advantage , they all yours ... " . this lack trust present throughout book machiavelli not discriminate his conclusion classes . poor rich alike when it comes interest . my view , this conundrum machiavelli : he generalises men untrustworthy yet he talks loyalty patriotism , especially when it comes himself . book more than study human nature politics . while reading it i started understand much better italian history . it clear my view why italy so fragmented politics this country so volatile . it goes back hundreds years struggle power influencial families . during this time they become experts diplomacy finding right balance power . i found amazing how papacy managed survive landscape littered stories ruin , deceit , death temporary success . italy battle ground papacy , powerful italian families , french spanish emperors . country lots old memories , i believe , still strong presence today affairs . it interesting machiavelli noted strong pricipality could based strong cities . he uses example german cities strong fortifications , moats artilery " ... they enough work sort mainstay city keep populace engaged their usual crafts space year " . this description economic power , seed future capitalism . i found interesting although he noted importance economic capacity , he missed it list critical elements success , limiting it include only political military . machiavelli principles power politics applied warfare business . he discussess extensively what prince should maintain power when conquering new territories . i worked couple years company aggressive acquirer i say machiavelli observations apply incredibly well many scenarios acquisitions , especially if they hostile . apart mergers acquisitions , some studies human nature revealed when people new leader apply quite well today politics played even department level . there few lessons there . example if new ruler conquers new territory chances preserving territory increase greatly if ruler moves residency new territory . this what turkish sultan preserve greek territory . i find instructive , today terms , follow more closely see if acquiring company high ranking officer moving new territory belonging acquired company . machiavelli master language . he manages express human beliefs touching primitive cord makes you pay attention wonder . he , however , biased too much towards idea humans either evil or greedy or arrogant or stupid . i supose one could forgive considering living conditions he endured when he wrote book . nowadays , he could published same book , cash royalties , make movie , make very comfortable living . here fragment letter he wrote his friend , francesco vettori : " ... meanwhile lunchtime arrives , together my family , i eat whatever food my poor house scanty patrimony afford . lunched , i return inn . there i generally find innkeeper , butcher , miller , two kiln-tenders . their company i idle rest day away playing cricca tricchetrach - games give rise host quarells , cutting remarks , insults . often we fight over penny heard yelling far off san casciano . set down among these lice , this how i keep mould my brain find release fortune malice . i am content her beat me down this way see if she won't become ashamed " great book , worth every penny every minute . served good glass wine , or cup tea quiet environment . get ready surprises , interesting associations intellectual delight .	1

i very disappointed this book . i very eager read this book learn wolfram thoughts new approach science , but there nothing this book justifies such lofty title . first six chapters book describe various types cellular automata , which computational models whose evolutionary behavior governed simple rules . wolfram devoted much his scientific career studying such systems . one particular system caught wolfram interest cellular automata model he calls " rule 30 " . what so remarkable " rule 30 " ? rule 30 starts off single element , through repeated application simple rule , rapidly evolves into system involving apparently complex behavior . there two big problems first six chapters this book . first , wolfram never bothers try explain what so special " rule 30 " . why doesn't rule 29 or rule 31 show complex behavior ? what essential elements rule 30 give complexity ? wolfram gives no information this . second big problem wolfram much too repetitive . point complexity generated simple rules hammered over over again . this book could clearly used lot editing . rest book describes ways which cellular automota applied various scientific problems , but no concrete , specific pathways given how tackle these various problems . rather , chapters consist various suggestions musings wolfram how cellular automata may relate wide range scientific problems . breadth his discussions more impressive than their depth , which often never gets much deeper than noting visual similarities some his diagrams physical appearances shells , tiger stripes , snowflakes , etc . key problem this book it never attempts analyze why some rules give " complex " behavior why others don't . i'm reminded story wolfram himself related time he showed richard feynman printout " rule 30 " : " well , we'd just crawling around floor -- help some other people -- trying use meter rules measure some feature giant printout it . feynman takes me aside , rather conspiratorially , says : " look , i just want ask you one thing : how you know rule 30 would all this crazy stuff ? " " you know me , " i said . " i didn't . i just computer try all possible rules . i found it . " " ah , " he said , " now i feel much better . i worried you some way figure it out . " " both wolfram feynman geniuses , but feynman something wolfram doesn't: gift seeing past unessentials getting gist problem . wolfram fills his books countless pages diagrams showing " complex " behavior , but never tries explain essential nature rule 30 . after reading this book , i'm also reminded statement freeman dyson , brilliant scientist , after he looked wolfram book : " there tradition scientists approaching senility tocome up grand , improbable theories . wolfram unusual he doing this his 40 "	-1

i must say this book stand it presents radically different view parenting than most books i've read . it holds most important thing kids very strong relationship their parents , almost all woes today kids caused them peer oriented instead parent oriented . authors make very strong case this so . i convinced time this part book over . however , many books this type , section where we told what this problem weaker . most ideas would work best very young child not yet become peer oriented . if you already child who rebellious addicted peers , i don't think speaking them kindly looking them eyes going much . author gave example his own children taking them away week vacation just child parent . sounds good , but i don't think his children severe problems other examples we given . book also perspective parents caring , kind , loving their childrens ' best interests heart . i know parents who read parenting books more likely fit this perspective , but i kept thinking not all parents completely wonderful . i think many child saved childhood would otherwise hellish their friends . author also feels children friendships not really true friendships , they not mature enough true friendships . i respect their courage say peer relationships not important we always led believe . but i think childhood friendships true ones . i know i still am very , very close least 3 my friends young childhood , i say looking back our friendship true start . i don't mean overly dispute message this book . i think it extremely well written brave book , i influenced ideas presented here very much . i just think it like most ideas taken extreme --- they fall apart bit when this case . but i want thank authors presenting this view parenting . it going play part my decision whether or not homeschool my oldest child . definately worth read	1

superstars children literature often contend continual cries their fans further adventures stories . how long you think j.k. rowling able keep her promise only seven harry potter tales before she breaks down consents one further story ? we should never forget when character ( or characters ) becomes famous beloved , he/she/they cannot rest peace . even sherlock holmes rose his grave star further adventures imaginings . it should come no surprise then lloyd alexander acquiesced , after fashion , his adoring public . after asked writer further tales land prydain , alexander chose give public what they wanted . sort . stories this book take place prydain they contain many beloved characters we've grown know . sly twist , however , alexander sets all these tales before any action we read prydain chronicles . this experiment prefacing stories we already know so well could ended up either derivative or depressing george lucas attempt create first three movies " star wars " series . instead , they end up tiny parables speak hope , light , beauty midst potential bloodshed terror . they're well worth reading . there eight stories this book total . first , " foundling " tale how sorcerer dallben raised three weird sisters midst swampy home gained more wisdom than he wanted . " stone " shows us dwarf doli his encounter man who wants live forever ( finds it unaccountably dull ) . " true enchanter " kind how-they-met tale explaining why princess eilonwy mother ( who , like all alexander heroines , exactly like eilonwy herself ) fell her very unmagical father . " rascal crow " just alexander excuse write his very own aesop tale too-clever crow his animal allies . " sword " explains why sword drynwyn met taran black blood . " smith , weaver , harper " parable , this time displaying continual greed man something little better . finally " truthful harp " shows how fflewddur fflam got his magic harp how coll dallben met " coll his white pig " . stories ( alexander himself points out author note ) read without picked up single prydain book before . i wouldn't necessarily recommend doing though . how significant average reader going find fact king rhitta died hand his own sword deep spiral castle if they haven't already picked up " book three " ? or dallben grew old before his time ? these stories aren't strictly need-to-know , but it certainly help . tales themselves , they're all right . nothing too spectacular , if you want my honest opinion . they take most basic elements all good folktales rework them over over . if there common theme any these stories , it all good tales work threes . alexander reworked them such way they appear somewhat original , but don't particularly surprised if you predict where each story going long before its close . end , this book really best those die-hard fans " prydain chronicles " who're clamoring further lloyd alexander facts fancies . anyone else probably find books little repetitive not particularly new . they're lovely little tales but there little recommend them but books they preface . nice but unnoticeable .	1

it insulting ( it must disheartening)for poet john ashbery stature told , again again , his poems don't make any sense . ashbery artificial superficially . it his critics who generally seem cold clever me . i laughed wept over his books ! i am hoping others my age ( i'm 30 ) not fall into same trap , which seems toplague older readers , smug vague their approval his work ( i.e. imitating what they think he like rather than what he poet . ) like allen ginsberg sylvia plath , different ways , i suppose , we need establish new critical basis discussing his work , which falls outside conventional opinions prejudices day . this may only say , ashbery become part canon american poetry ( this hardly denied) -- raises him higher plateau than those poets we see simply contemporaries ; it doesn't make him boring stiff . we enjoy unconventional ideas this most surprising poets ? example , much i admire self-portrait convex mirror book individual poem ; i acknowledge it masterpiece ... i nonetheless don't find it entertaining touching , ultimately , books included selected poems such some trees houseboat days wave . tennis court oath , which represented breakthrough both ashbery poetry , contains some his most beautiful , rapturous work , like quot ; how long i able inhabit divine sepulcher ... quot ; i don't think he wrote freely again , such musical emotional pull , until later flow chart , which sometimes similar even extact detail . bees , instance : quot ; probably always haunted beequot ; quot ; polluted any case bees . quot ; love main theme , after all , ashbery entire oeuvre . somebody once said me his poems like whiff perfume . it true , best sense . because they lovely contain sort romanticism eroticism one remembers them fondly . he may , i believe pauline kael wrote filmmaker max ophuls , quot ; nostalgia present . quot ; although he sometimes risks becoming objectionable purist himself -- he appear too fussy argumentative it own sake , or even rude , times -- he mostly kind , fair balanced , funny though he undeniably . who doesn't like poet like , or understand him ? even if one very different aesthetic , it intoxicating or even comforting voice listen . selected poems good place start , but then , if you chance , read whole volumes , what come after . you'll chance , because they ought around forever	1
like du maurier rebecca or tolkien sauron , julius caesar play which bears his name less focal presence than force largely off-stage which provokes choices actions more evident characters . caesar put several brief appearances during first three acts , but it marcus brutus whose nobility , naivete , seduction , treachery , rationalization , ultimate downfall make up overarching plot . shakespeare here avoids taking sides , however , so provides us shrewd study diverse motives attitudes always precede insurrection , chaos inevitably follows . most arden series , this critical edition represents superior scholarship valuable reader assistance . its extensive footnotes should illumine most instances unfamiliar language or allusion , appendix provides relevant excerpts plutarch lives , which shakespeare consulted many his details . those new julius caesar , however , best advised begin text play itself ( volume central section ) , saving so-called ' introduction ' until afterwards ; daniell excellent discussion relies heavily citations play content , his insights apt lost reader who , yet , little or no frame reference . it should noted , too , arden shakespeare editions best suited serious students amateurs already acquainted bard aspiring more advanced appreciation . come late field myself , i mean no condescension suggesting someone just setting out may find wealth material here bit overwhelming . potential rewards shakespearean discovery incalculable , it always tragic when worthy ambition burns itself out , want patience , attempting too much too soon . i began more modest editions , such signet classics or pelican , which i found very accessible sufficiently annotated provide help i then needed . arden , which issuing revising its series since 1899 , still around when one ready it .	1
it likely neither ha jin nor his publisher ever expected his novel , war trash , become best seller or anything . it , after all , story chinese prisoners-of-war american prison camps south korea during korean war . not exactly kind thing most people think first thing morning . but if goal good novel entertain inform , then this one passes flying colors . it narrated first person yu yuan , one few captured chinese education one fewer still who able speak smattering english . though not communist , he nevertheless associated them because he knew it his only hope return mainland china , where both his ailing mother fiancee resided . if he side nationalists , he would repatriated taiwan , never hope visiting mainland china again . ( this , way , very interesting . many chinese looked upon their prisoner status way which escape newly formed communist government mainland china . ) , it turns out , it great conflict novel . both nationalist communist forces struggled mightily each other hearts minds those unallied prisoners , often most brutal fashion . one education one who spoke english , narrator himself considered prize , therefore received great deal attention both sides . indeed , after knocked unconscious one night , words , " *** communism , " tattooed bold fashion across his belly nationalists , who assumed he would no choice but side them . this , it turns out , rather common tactic . but narrator refused side them -- although occasionally pretending so out fear or self-preservation -- instead staying allied his communist protectors only so he could return his girlfriend mother . this plot . both his his fellow prisoner struggle survival prison , unwavering behind-the-barbed-wire war nationalists communists narrator fulcrum point , what comprise bulk novel . it should come no surprise anyone who any knowledge history all learn narrator ultimate repatriation mainland china bitterly disappointing . though not communist , he still traitor , you see , allowing himself captured . he found his mother died , his girlfriend could not afford associate him any more , he " disgraced captive .

there much like much useful bock commentary gospel luke . bock obviously his homework . one feature his commentary first rate when he approaches difficulties text or areas where scholars disagree , bock provides lists alternative explanations , who advocates them , his view their respective strengths weaknesses . if bock not see clear winner , he candid it . bock practice providing clear explanation different approaches text or problems history or sources extends excellent series " excursuses " end book . topics covered include census quirinius , sources synoptic relationships , genealogies matthew luke , discussions son man sayings . each section well written provides reader clear picture possible conclusions . bock more emphatic his own conclusions some sections than others . this section greatly enhances his commentary . feature distinguishes this book other commentaries luke its focus sources historicity . bock spends more time these issues , obviously linked his mind , than most other commentaries . he also highlights discussions their own sections . though they well written , degree satisfaction i felt after reading each one varied . some left me wanting much more discussion . i realize there space limitations gospel-specific commentaries , but sometimes felt bock bitten off more than he could chew . not he could not handle issues informed manner , but he simply insufficient space so . introduction well written , but not spend much time issues like authorship dating than i would liked . i am sure bock more offer those issues . instead , introduction spends more time dealing specific topics lucan text , such jerusalem : innocent one slain raised , faith dependence , prayer . most commentaries introduce reader some gospel authors theology focus , but i thought some these discussions would better served special notes within general discussion text , or more excursuses end . this simply organizational preference mine . sections well written . finally , i one other organizational criticism . he usually begins his discussion particular set passage overview his opinions passages . then he discusses " source history " , includes examination structure outline passage . only then he actually repeat text full section " exegesis exposition . " bock then includes summary additional notes . placing actual text middle discussion seemed odd me bugged me throughout . again , this just organizational , ergonomic , preference mine . actual discussions good . i simply believe they could enhanced different organization . overall , though i my organizational quibbles , valuable commentary exposes reader many different perspectives potential solutions problematic passages luke .	1

okay , i know some readers gave this 5 stars but i rather disappointed photo this book considering price . pics me quite small generally . additionally , there only photo few plants described . most entries no illustrations all . other words , let say there average 4-6 plants described each 2 page spread , { left right } , there might one , very infrequently two , very small , washed out looking photos only one out all plants listed page . also , i say pictures general not only small but they also seemed like they very old ; ie .. rather like drab pics someone 1964 honeymoon hawaii . what incredibly colorful dramatic plants , these small pictures seemed almost monochromatic ! { considering subject matter i would consider this almost criminal offense !! } . sorry so critical but there it ; this actually first book i ever return i bought amazon first book put out timber press i not utterly thrilled . normally timber pr . counted really fantastic stuff . fact they few other titles cover same material much better than this . i highly recommend you take look those before you fork over $ this one . my apologies author	1

clearly , proust remarkable gift perception , if he able see human experience , circumstance , even plain objects , exploded detail , distill them reader . particularly first third parts book , he frequently drops gems absolute truth , much same way shakespearean couplets remarkably capture essence love or revenge . me , this reward reading book , what makes challenge worth undertaking . first , you may overwhelmed his very complex sentences , others noted . it important proust express entire thought one sentence ; lofty objective sometimes dire consequences , but proust adheres it admirably . you soon learn maintain subject sentence your head while proust explores two or three tangents original thought before he comes back it . what works reader favor proust very regular his sentence structure , so once you develop feel it , it ceases intimidate . book divided into three parts : first third parts recount experiences proust early childhood , while second part details love affair charles swann . me , first part most beautiful , followed third part . you able tell within first 50 or so pages whether or not proust suit you . second part book becomes plodding monotonous , proust narrates even simple set circumstances many layers redundancy , each recounted exhaustive detail , his complex style which begins feel formulaic , wordy , indulgent . here subject sentence , tangent number one , tangent tangent number one , tangent number two , then it ends yet metaphor invalids . regularity sentence structure much easier tolerate first third parts because proust flits several ideas or subjects , whereas second part , he drills very core earth one or two subjects few variations . i found myself feeling pretty burned out , counting down pages end part 2 . my advice pick up your reading speed if it starts become boring or if you lose your concentration . if proust not quite so overly thorough part 2 , or if he varied his cadence or sentence structure bit more , i could recommend this book without hesitation . it , it require unusual investment concentration patience , but i believe it worth it	1

shakespeare scholar , i read countless books my favorite writer . two books stand out best : john dover wilson quot ; what happens hamlet ? quot ; caroline spurgeon quot;shakespeare imagery . quot ; if i could only keep two shakespeare books my library , i would choose these . dr. spurgeon spent ten years sifting through entire shakespeare canon pulling out every metaphor simile she could find . then , she organized them into like groups . this offered her , us through her writing , insight into shakespeare creative genius . evidence hand , dr. spurgeon explored how shakepeare mind actually worked ; she uncovered his patterns creative thinking . his abundant use garden household images his relatively few uses classical or scholarly images show us writer more touch real everyday world . his childhood homelife , images one tends carry throughout one life , become crystal clear when set side side this fashion . spurgeon book , we clearly see works shakespeare written shakespeare , who born small town stratford , not works university trained dramatist or member queen elizabeth court . it fascinating see shakespeare images compared contrasted those marlowe , dekker , johnson . each writer thought created images unique manner . seeing understanding differences , expertly explained dr. spurgeon , gives one deeper insight into appreciation one greatest minds all time . if you love shakespeare then not miss reading this book	1
best military history i've ever read believe me i've read lot ' em .... explodes lots myths ( some intentional us navy ) much stuff wasn't declassified until late 80 . i think they ( us navy ) embarassed this book explains why . very little opinion it all thoroughly documented foot-noted . it reads like novel , mostly german british viewpoints . i couldn't put it down . there definitely severe criticism u.s. navy actions during 1942 before , but author gannon gives sound reasons coming his conclusions . one may argue details , but 3,997 ships sunk atlantic enough testimony something went haywire . gannon refuses gloss over mistakes made all sides conflict just lays out all facts . admiral king , gannon references excerpt general eisenhower 1942 wartime journal said quickest way end war atlantic " shoot admiral king . " even gannon acknowledges us navy finally catch tactical strategic lessons anti-submarine warfare ( after much goading british canadians ) , but i believe even seasoned students military history absolutely shocked timidity incompetence naval high command outbreak war germany . this book well foot-noted indexed so if one so inclined primary source material readily examined .	1
many reviews this book seem driven " how could he ?

twisted selection short stories thriller writer jeffrey deaver . deaver points out intro one advantage short stories you alter ending or characters make story little darker or depressing than novel . since reader only invests few minutes into short story , they don't expect happy or tidy ending . all stories this collection suspensful involve twist some sort . services rendered triangle probably two best . they stand out because twist . all stories similar they only involve few characters . so when story goes one direction , you correct assuming twist involve story going other direction end . this book easy read may perhaps persuade me pick up jeffrey deaver novel . i'm all twists turns , but some reason not enjoy empty chair . i haven't read any more deaver since . i don't know if its worth paying money short story collection . but if you deaver fan , or suspense fan , i'm sure you'll enjoy this collection stories .	1

i listen dr. dean time time i really enjoy listening him . i thoroughly enjoyed reading his book well . first all , you need realize dr. dean not practicing physician . ( he doesn't see patients or perform procedures diagnoses ) however , he claims spend lot time reading research studies , something many busy physicians may not time . so , sense he different kind experience - knowledge gained study , not first-hand experience . this good because it different view what your doctor may . this book , dr dean challenges many myths we what it means " healthy " . one opinion he shares his readers little overweight may not such bad thing . fact , it gives body some reserves case illness . this goes so contrary what we usually hear , but it really makes you think . he also challenges number myths we hear such " exercise increases your appetite actually makes you gain weight " . he explains why these aren't true . dr. dean also touches one my personal favorite myths - germophobia . some our ideas where germs hide how prevent getting sick aren't always correct . example , place your home most germs not your bathroom - it your kitchen . if you read this book , you may not so excited get hotel room jetted tub next time . most valuable thing this book it makes you think . media loves hype up health concerns - " ebola virus spread kill us all ?

i heard amusing stories how messed up brian wilson one point , but until reading this i never realized how not funny his condition ! it must painful writing it it living it . i dont think i've ever heard such brutally honest confessions stories such important icon wilson . additionally , this probably one best source inside info beach boys , since brian practically beach boys . i am aware some other books written , but who could tell better story than person who lived it ? this case this story cant effectively told anyone but brian ( ... who else would know what voices his head said , etc . ) while reading , you get imoression ( actually its quite obvious ) this book written during time when relationships other bandmates obviously strained , it particularly evident latter part book . much bitterness directed mike love , perhaps justifiably so based other accounts i've read him . after reading , i'm not sure i agree totally dr. landy methods , but i believe brian wouldnt around write this book it not landy . this book could ended brian quot ; resurrectionquot ; 1983 , all events descrbed after really alot bitterness downright nastiness directed other beach boys . i'm not faulting brian this , it seemed me most it landy influence . it seemed like landy way getting back other beach boys exposing him fraud he really turned out brian expense , brian ended up sued over this book what i understand . still though , this book offers first hand accounts some events inspired ( or case smile , destroyed ) most beach boys material . i hope someday this book de-landyized re-written brian . this fascinating important insight into pop music should not out print . how important ? name least one other major icon sixties ever published auto-biography . stones ? dylan ? beatles ? none , all 3rd party observation speculative accounts . besides , much i love these other bands , they cant hold candle musically brian wilson . read this book , but stop after you get 1983	1

black woman i enjoyed reading this insight into how people see black men how they see themselves . there not enough positive role models form black fathers young black men look up . there very strong critical element black families could sometimes make me cringe child growing up . you felt if you constantly explain yourself walking egg shells not positive encouraging comment sight . my step-father very negative never really showed much consistent interest anything you interested or wanted achieve . thinking umpteen reasons why it could go wrong or couldn't . not very tactile or loving man either . always busy workaholic casting very controlling element over whole family . this made you feel if you worth nothing could achieve nothing . these days i hate see this rap culture baseball caps turned backwards this loping walk looks like they've got limp . or worst thing i hate see tracksuit bottoms pulled down so you see their underwear !! i find this sloppy despicable close indecent exposure . also you walk past black person not even recognition form smile or friendly hello . this very bad , so i recently made decision make effort make eye contact smile or say hello . it up black people read more their own history culture . we should know all black inventors people who played their important parts history . we should know names african peoples areas map africa they occupied . we should know african jamaican proverbs stories etc . not latest rap artist their explicit lyrics track they've recently cut !! we should also know ins outs slavery . i don't care if no other race recognises us important present tense or what our ancestors through . quite frankly what new ? it us recognise bring memory . black children , both male female need more positive role models within their own families . black parents relatives need stop so apathetic teaching black children their culture backgrounds . charity begins home not just form good manners .	1

books leadership dime dozen these days , often they start blending together . however , john maxwell put together some great insights into leadership often taken granted or not well described . book starts solid question any leader ; " am i raising up potential leaders ? " . what makes this focus important fact too often leaders focus leading results , not future leadership . important distinction . aspect book looks ripple effects leaders . true leaders able attract potential leaders because ; leaders think like them ; leaders express feelings other leader sense ; leaders create environment attracts potential leaders ; leaders not threatened people great potential . author lays out what happens when strong leaders not selected . they turn hire people less leadership skills than they , so . organization whole suffers result this domino effect . leaders who mentor potential leaders multiply their effectiveness . while this sounds simple , it rare . " there no success without successor " ( page 11 ) . leaders take others them , or they not true leaders but mere managers . delegation most powerful tool leader . ( page 159 ) however , if delegation so important then why some leaders fail delegate effectively ? some ideas postulated here ; insecurity ; lack confidence others ; lack ability train others ; lack time ; etc . my experience most common these aspects lack confidence , many so called leaders never take final step " giving complete authority " others . this derails success future potential . i find this most common weakness leaders corporate america , who turn should not considered leaders , but rather just people higher titles . overall , this very good book . author asserts leadership both combination tactical choices personal character , latter more important . great book , easy read , some assessments other tools included . this book benefit anyone who wants enable success their organization through leadership .	1

like alison lurie first novel , " love friendship " , her second deals marital disharmony among members america academic community . whereas earlier book , however , set wintry new england , " nowhere city " takes place sunny california . paul cattleman , young university historian , accepts job big corporation based los angeles write company history . one major themes book cultural differences america east west coasts . paul his wife katherine both easterners , she upper-class new england family . first they react their change scene very different ways . paul loves los angeles its sunny climate its relaxed lifestyle . katherine , other hand , hates city . this partly because atmospheric pollution aggravates her allergies , but mostly because she regards it cultural wasteland , " nowhere city " book title . los angeles , her , appears no sense history , place living " eternal dizzying present " , where differences seasons , even day night , less distinct than they north-east . differences couple create tensions within their marriage . paul begins affair young waitress named ceci gets drawn into her circle unconventional friends living venice beach , time centre beatnik community . ( book set early sixties ) . this leads into theme book , way which california became americans second half twentieth century what america general europeans earlier generations- frontier , place refuge those dissatisfied one reason or life home seeking better life elsewhere . los angeles area therefore natural magnet beatnik hippie movements . ( this idea california " last resort " also theme eagles ' song name ; it interesting lurie later borrowed title one her own novels , although book set florida rather than california ) . katherine , seeking something which occupy herself , finds work secretary university california , where she too begins affair her boss , academic psychiatrist who estranged husband glamorous hollywood starlet named glory green . this leads complex emotional entanglement . paul affair ceci comes end ; she knows full well he married , but cannot accept idea he still sexual relations his wife . paul then seduced glory , who seeking revenge against her husband . eventually , paul finds himself falling out love california lifestyle , especially after company refuse publish his history which shows them too harsh light , decides move back east take up teaching job prestigious new england college , decision which provokes ironic role-reversal book ending . i can't agree earlier reviewer who said you begin book hating katherine sympathizing paul . my sympathies katherine throughout . paul selfish character who always put his own needs before those his wife ; he bullies her into moving california , ceci no means his first extra-marital affair . it seemed me book written subtly feminist viewpoint interpreted story how katherine learns stand up , say no , her self-centred husband . normal lurie work , tone book , despite some serious themes , relatively light , plenty satirical humour aimed characters ' pretensions . big nutting corporation like social kudos harvard-educated historian their payroll , but not like it when he tells them some truths they not want hear . dr einsam psychiatrist so busy analysing life he unable experience it . glory film industry types who surround her shown up shallow , vain insincere . ( satire hollywood sixties reminded me joan didion " play it it lays " , although book darker more serious tone ) . beatniks childish , more economically dependent than they like think " square " society they despise . although they see society intolerant narrow-minded , same could said their own system values its " them us " mentality . times i found some this satire somewhat unfair . beatnik hippie movements may their hypocritical side , but least their unconventionality idealism force middle america ask itself some difficult questions it might preferred avoid . there really no unpretentious or sincere people working entertainment industry ? nevertheless , satirist role not fair-minded ; satire strains see both sides every question nails its colours firmly fence hardly worthy name . theme cultural differences east coast west coast america perhaps less interesting me , englishman , than it would american readership . ( it always struck me , anyway , two coasts more common each other than either america interior heartland ) . although this not my favourite alison lurie book ( i prefer some her later books such " real people " " truth lorin jones " which greater depth insight ) , " nowhere city " certainly enjoyable read	1

this book describes few simple techniques dealing difficult questions audience after formal business presentation , or journalists after press conference . particular , author explains how control interaction questioners , formulate answers less likely perceived audience contentious or evasive , how forcefully get one message across part answer . techniques themselves could described 4 or 5 pages . nevertheless author manages put together whole book - firstly analogizing them martial arts , then providing detailed examples last 40 years presidential debates . this works out very well indeed , reader left thorough understanding mechanics involved handling these situations - based both concepts debate examples described . after finishing book i really felt i coming away something tangible could utilized my advantage variety situations - both professional personal .	1

prose author delightful : it originally published 1930 when better authors genteel but sophisticated style . author original intention set forth theory metaphor distinguishing analyzing , title says , seven forms ( linguistic ) ambiguity . he draws examples which he exercizes his probative skill mostly great writers english language . but those schooled after , say , 1950s it wonderful exhortation read , speak write more subtelty than usually encountered . corollary case he makes ambiguity -- carefully crafted ambiguity , not ambiguity slothful kind -- very powerful , but it presupposes precision reading writing which precondition well-crafted metaphor . such it stands our generations exhortation lingusitic sophistication implicit disproof quot ; libertyquot ; goes hand hand slovenliness . it certainly make better readers out those who go through his book	1

this brilliant book . book speaks itself . my words can't it justice . i think everyone should read this book . only thing bothers me it it needs updating . author this new edition explain forward it written over decade ago , anticipation ssc , whose funding got cut . however , not enough . if author or publisher not want update text book itself , they should provided footnotes throughout . example , when it mentions top quark not discovered , deserves comment its discovery , if not appendix . it wouldn't take much effort just add footnotes , it would help make book more timeless . also , paper this edition could better . quality not quite bad " mass market paperback " , but almost . regardless my few negative comments , this one all-time best scientific books written popular audience	1
i read whole ender series , but strange sequence which may affected way i view different books series . first book i read shadow hegemon , thanks tourist left it library hotel skiathos island . this book got me hooked , but it confused me also i didn't know if i should start reading next books or previous ones . general pattern whole series : beginning book ender game . then we two subcategories , one shadow series ( which , exception first book , take place earth more within military strategy ) one ender series ( which take place space more into new sci-fi ideas ) . shadow series probably read everyone , while i guess ender series ( especially speaker dead onwards ) would read mainly sci-fi fans . below my comments books series , order i read them marking ( 10 highest mark ): shadow hegemon : first book i read , which i could not leave my hands . i finished it 2 days . it fast paced action , very smart plot after reading it i believed orson scot card ( osc ) invented/re-invented new genre literature . military strategy adventure combined brilliance/mind games hidden portions romance . such books always existed but this seemed book . it like way dan brown re-invented books trivials puzzles , together fast paced adventure . i strongly recommend it everybody likes such type books . ( mark : 10)shadow puppets : sequel above . i found it interesting but somehow boring above story developed little focus characters ( maybe too much focus so it seemed me it slightly mumbling jumbling . strategy , brilliance adventure seemed very low here . i would not recommend it anybody read it isolate , unfortunately you read it if you want go next book . i really believe osc made mistake here ( deliberately or not ) this book should told 50-60 pages included previous or next book . ( mark : 6 but you read it because you want read shadow giant)shadow giant : ( see below)ender game : really great book read , probably best series , however , i read its sequels first , when i reached 80% this book , i predicted end . however , it highest standards sci-fi , military strategy , adventure , brilliant mind games very good depth human aspect characters . comparison shadow series , it more " space " sci-fi , while shadow series much lesser sci-fi elements more down earth . ( mark : 10)speaker dead : great book , but different style . less adventure , more human aspect , more maturity . brilliance yes , but not military , sci-fi yes ( some great ideas ) but not spaceship style . ( mark : 9)xenocide : good sequel previous novel . certain points more brilliant , other sections more boring , however again very good sci-fi book . only flaw these series ( speker dead , xenocide , children mind ) idea behind one alien species described which i found outrageously extreme , however if you ignore it becomes first class reading . ( mark : 9)children mind : i think osc wrapped up his case pretty badly one . it fair book except fact i felt osc mumbles jumbles one third novel not decided how end it . other critiques i found it described nice approach moral dilemmas , however , moral dilemma when you describe it once make your choice , while here dilemma repeated repeated ... i felt like i watching movie worth 10 oscars end not worth included even cheap video movie . again , many open ends end ( possible sequels ) . ( mark : 7 but you read it you hooked previous ones ) . ender shadow : read enders game shadow hegemon , i found this book probably best series , which course my subjective preference . i could characterize it probably best book i read ever ! not repeat myself , it all shadow hegemon ender game , even more ... ( mark : absolute 10 ) . shadow giant : when i read shadow puppets , i said , " that it , osc lost either his talent or his appetite good writing ... " , so i pretty unwilling read it . fortunately i decided , it proved good one , i believe osc nicely wrapped up his story , two small flaws . * one described below ( its end needed slightly more complete ) , * other fact although he describes certain smart battles , he not focus enough them it seems he hurry wrap all things up . it all elements become masterpiece but it ended up good read book ( mark : 9)in general , both series three categories good stuff : 1 ) some great sci-fi ideas ( battle room , battle games , fantasy game , ansible , aia , jane , in/out travel , raman varelse etc)2 ) great military strategy , mind games etc combined adventure3 ) certain books , depth characters , moral dilemmas etcand two main bad stuff : 1 ) mumbling jumbling certain books which completely unnecessary ( either osc wanted just produce sell title - see shadow puppets- or he could not decide how story continue-see last book ender series ) . 2 ) one alien species described ender series so too outrageous even sci-fi made it look ridiculous . idea behind it brilliant sci-fi terms , but he could try different living organism ... finally , osc left open ends both series ( probably next sequels ) , however i believe there two things missing . ) story hive queen hegemon , told metaphorical manner so it means much humanity . ) ancient theatre , story should end way brings " katharsis " story , souls readers . i believe end shadow giant may smart commercial purposes but it very unfair reader it not bring full " katharsis " .	1

epic tale combining mystery fantasy , treason more than meets expectations--i'd even go so far say it one card best . although storylines completely different , card visits moral dilemmas familiar readers ender series : genocide acceptable tradeoff salvation entire planet ? sacrifice one individual justifiable greater good entire race ? ender game , card creates cold oppressive cage known battle school confine young ender . treason , card creates lush diverse world his protagonist lanik mueller explore his exile . whereas ender growth largely internal self-driven , mueller picks up extraordinary powers while walking earth , meeting new people learning new skills . lanik frequently forced ask himself deeper questions life , sacrifice , identity , all while understanding more he learns , more complex difficult his choices become . he starts novel alone freak ; saving his own skin almost more than he manage . he ends novel terrible powers responsibility comes them , forced choose best way save planet hurtling towards destruction death . unlike ender , he fully aware choice he must make , making his decision all more anguishing tragic . card takes many risks creating fantastic world reader must simply accept -- this tale belongs more realm fantasy than pure " science " fiction . yet risk pays off , making reading experience all more memorable . reader drawn nature protagonist grotesque transformation beauty world stretches imagination . mystery intrigue surrounding planet sudden power shifts keeps plot moving nicely , card creates strong believable cast characters breathe life into story , giving it center soul . finally , card leaves reader ponder lanik decision face nearly impossible choice , world characterized not black white but subtle shades grey . treason probably never garner attention ender game , but nevertheless it excellent thought-provoking story . this book hidden gem canon modern sf fantasy literature reward reader who takes time unearth it	1

since i took graduate seminar course women memoirs american literature , i read several books heilbrun . i not going specialize autobiography/memoirs or feminist theory , i read her more writer than scholar or theorist , focusing more how she says things than what . this regard , i enjoyed every book i read because her language something unique . it clear concise , without simple , authoratitive without pedantic , seemingly aloof yet strangely persuasive . if passion name talent , she very , very passionate , but passion moderated unique kind resignation ( or perhaps , wisdom ) . this book not my favorite , compared other titles such writing women lives , it indeed gets slow heavy here there . there parts where even those same line work heilbrun would go , " who cares ? " or " why bother ? " yet , largely , it accessible * fun * . read intellectual memoir , it story how heilbrun gratefully influenced three men , how she resisted embraced their influence , how she finally grew out it . there many interesting anecdotes coming her encounters these men ( barzun , fadiman , trilling ) her life graduate student 50s one most highly regarded universities us . students today would gasp nightmarish inconvinience only two copies their papers , painfully taking turns reading other student papers due lack copies . heilbrun devoted chapter diana trilling , which wasn't her plan when he planned book . she fascinated gained admiration her process research book , readers would clearly see why chapter her . sum , according heilbrun , diana trilling woman whose insights her life come largely feminism ( " most successful revolution our century , " trilling herself called it ) , yet who not herself feminist . she accepted life belittlements others , while penetrating understanding those belittlements . early book , heilbrun notes perhaps one most palpable influences she got lionel trilling would notion " tragedy what most marks us if we thinkers . " this what trilling shares freud , this what heilbrun shares trilling , despite her distrust freud , some extent , trilling well . this comment comes after anecdote trilling inspiring lecture henry james , which young heilbrun took idea " essence literature tensions thinking life . " this part book strangely moving , makes me think hard interplay among " tension , " " thinking life , " " tragedy , " " literature . " small not really ambitious book , but contains much fun insights .	1

just finished reading tragedy triumph where dr. loovas persuaded author tell her story , i find similarities sound miracle dr. bernard rimland coaxing this author , annabel stehli share her story . while reading these two books any parent child autism spectrum shocked learn what parents ahead us endured via professionals media based their incorrect perception autism . what i not agree promotional aspect these books , suggesting autism cured these kids overcome disability . sound miracle touted tribute mother courage , yet after reading same book , i feel mother failed daughter not gain proper insight into her autistic daughter georgie . there two parts sound miracle , auditory training not discussed first half book . not wanting criticize author too harshly i feel book delved more into her older daughter dotsie , who passed away leukemia , mother two marriages her own addictions religious beliefs . this could easily written into two or three books covering each topic depth . there gap many years when georgie graduated college author wrote book . maybe time she could see more clearly how georgie needed help right beginning . it obvious author not confident her parenting skills questioned herself throughout process raising children . author hard time cuddling receiving eye contact time georgie born 1965 , plus she knew there something odd her eyes , she low apgar score . there always seemed turmoil their apartment new york . her husband bill not very involved parenting aspects girls . early story annabel took girls away few weeks one summer vacation . during this time bill affair her best friend things went downhill drastically . bill not mentioned too often after , only briefly when dotsie died then when annabel wanted take georgie france . sound miracle upsetting me because after dotsie passed away georgie institutionalized many years . this started trial since there no alternative georgie . annabel intimidated staff institution believed them when they stated her lack parenting blame . one point she drinking taking many prescriptions , ended up committed herself . i found period time confusing because her mother siblings only involved intermittently . moment there i not want finish perusing this because i not sure which direction sound miracle headed found passing dotsie very sad . how parent time never heard dr. bernard rimland beyond me . it certainly seemed me author would not act her own parental instincts needed reassurance every move then it even took others persuade her remove georgie institution try auditory training dr. berard . while georgie institution her mother met married peter two more children . author actually pondered several times leaving georgie institution starting her own life her new husband children . she not devoted her daughter she wanted normal child her new son not risk her daughter coming home possibly hurting her baby . parent two children autism i learn great deal auditory aspects , but this due georgie sharing her personal experience not anything author shared parent . all those years georgie just assumed everyone saw heard things way she , but she crazy not able handle these issues same manner . one hand i truly disappointed first section book after reading suffering georgie endure due no one researching further her issues . i questioning author remarrying starting family when i felt she abandoned failed her daughter . most shocking part within book when institution contacted her ex husband , bill try persuade him keep her taking georgie out country . bill some relative look into dr switzerland agreed annabel this worth trying . it turned out otherwise i would very upset feel professionals should punished their wrong doing interference her life . i prefer books positive outlook autism not those base outcome miracle . although this one those some aspect , it still worthwhile read know firsthand what journey like others . but my children autistic what i gather always since i am not looking cure , but hope actually hear sound my child voice one these days . reader i cared dotsie georgie heartbroken over death one lost childhood other . i came away learning more trials tribulations this family know what avoid when pursuing therapies searching schools my children future reference	1

this book basically well-organized laundry list hoaxes . author arranges hoaxes logical categories based type deception involved . some , especially those further past , sound preposterous , but one must always account differences knowledge thought processes times past now . what most disturbing me fact some hoaxes sounded plausible ; it makes you wonder how many pieces knowledge we take granted might well-contrived hoaxes . conspiracy theorists take attitude extreme , seeing hoaxes everywhere . but hoaxes most prevalent when it hard get independent supporting data topic , which this book points out . instance , if white fellow turned up europe claimed taiwanese native , we would laugh him . but white fellow turn up europe several centuries ago , claiming native formosa ( taiwan former name ) . without additional information ( taiwanese asians ) , people europe unable quickly discount story	1

i've always looked upon " christian " fiction rather wary eye . it less subject matter than lesser quality these works ; it if publishers cynically assumed merely presenting something " christian " would enough guarantee certain level readership , no matter how poorly written book ( this often science fiction fantasy well ) . three ( or more properly , thr3e ) ted dekker little alter my view . ( why i read book ? because when i bought it ( dekker book ) , i didn't realize fully what i buying . ) three tells story kevin parson , seminary student who suffered strange , semi-abusive childhood . he gets phone call one day warning him unless he solves riddle within three minutes , his car explode . kevin doesn't solve riddle car blow up , but he escapes intac t.t hus begins cat-and-mouse game slater , who may or may not serial killer named riddle killer . slater believes kevin committed grave sin requires confession or death . kevin , his childhood friend samantha ( now state cop ) jennifer peters ( fbi agent ) try hunt down slater , but slater apparently too clever caught easily . there not much truly christian this book other than few religious lines ( never getting very preachy ) definitely pg-rated material : language gentle enough , romance chaste violence relatively bloodless . i'm fine all long story good , that not case here . it actually too bad , because dekker seems like decent enough plotter , but story relies plot twist one most annoying suspense fiction ; i won't say what it , but even dekker seems bit uncomfortable it , he spends lot time rationalizing it . addition , perpetrate this twist , he actively deceive ( not merely mislead ) reader , which cheat . addition , even though dekker good sense plot ( till end ) he able maintain fast , tense pace , he overall , just passable writer . i suppose technically his work proficient , but compared great names crime stories ( elmore leonard , michael connelly , lee child , etc . ) , dekker prose just flat . two-star rating , it not worst book out there , but it one avoid .	1

this book annoyed me . start my diatribe , there too many characters , each every one one whom seemed illogical , stupid , not all endearing . " paranormal " branch mounties ? i thought it supposed fantasy affecting real people this world , not fantasy affecting fantasy . one gets idea author tried explain what happening readers , but ended up explaining things characters instead which why one never believe it when characters disbelieving . i never believe it when characters anything , actually . i don't understand how anybody brains could function like . their thought processes just absurd . protaginist needs stop smoking , because she seems roll new cigarette every sentance she inhabits . hard-boiled investigator should take look what his girlfriend puts his dinner because he accepts unacceptable ( least hard-boiled investigator ) unblinking reserve . male lead needs stop speaking thinking (!) french because he not , eccentric millionaire uncle needs borrow some protaginist ciggarettes calm down . only character i liked even remotely biker art critic , but i think author trying little too hard clever when blue born . it also very confusing way plot jumps around goes backwards forwards thirty some characters ( all whom , i must mention again , really annoying ) . it makes it hard one keep one attention book , instead just going over one grocery list whilst staring page . looks like delint some time travelling too . you excuse him , he gets mixed up . all those quantum leaps . what all outdated profanity ? i mean , who says " lord lifting jesus ! " anyway ? i agree reviewer named bounci , those ... occurances not fit just made me want laugh ( or cry , seeing it doesn't stop entire book ) instead shocked . it credit , book very interesting story , lot interesting things happening . it good suspense ( when it doesn't ramble hopelessly ) sometimes exciting . it while away hours though , it keep you book while you plod through	1

inner temple first book series penczak writing beginners . they based classes he teaches live , take much different approach than standard 101 guides . first , there well-laid out structure these books i find extremely helpful . each book designed year-and-a-day study course . there few introductory chapters followed 12 lesson chapters . you spend roughly month each lesson ( some more complex take more time , but they balanced simpler lessons ) . this gives you time absorb material , complete exercises , some additional reading . second , penczak emphasizes importance strong foundation meditation , visualization , psychic development dedicating entire inner temple these practices . more complex lessons circle casting , ritual design , spells saved outer temple . i found this major improvement over standard 101 book includes both same book no clear indication how much time you should spend foundation exercises before trying ritual , or worse , skip foundation exercises entirely . i honestly wished i picked up this book first when i started my journey . penczak approach witchcraft emphatically eclectic . you see concepts practices many occult traditions here . there obvious new age influence his work come across " fluffy , " but i don't think it bad some reviewers thought . he emphasizes love his practice , i not see anything wrong . should he emphasized potential dangers some practices more ? perhaps . he includes cautions , but tries put them perspective peel away intimidating veneer created horror movies like . course takes you varied tour starting simple skills like basic meditation , affirmations , very simple magic , more complex practices like astral travel , working spirit guides , healing , past-life regression . style also very open non-dogmatic . penczak presents lots personal opinions theories , but they presented opinions theories , not holy writ . because this eclecticism , this book could used selectively course psychic development anyone open mind , not just people interested wicca or paganism . all all , while i could find quite bit this book argue , i think it deserves five star rating its usefulness presentation . i thank mr. penczak making his teaching available wider audience this way	1

i enjoyed first two books this trilogy . however , this third book needs some serious time intensive book surgery unit before it should even published . frankly , this manuscript should kicked back editor author refused . i realize that pretty heavy thing say , but it true . something went badly wrong here . author not his job bringing his protagonists closure ; two kids fall love , then decide live apart rest their lives complete crock . puhleaze . i grew rather like aeronaut texan explorer , they're killed little point . puhleaze . iorek bear darn cool , he barely ( sorry ) makes appearance book 3 . puhleaze . , way , who mary , introduced so late trilogy , underfunded dark matter physicist ( who just happens ... ex-nun ... now , just wait minute here , heavy handed or what ? ) ... dark matter would * under * funded ? puhleaze .

" never give reader chance put down one your books , because if you , they , they'll never pick it up again . " . i zoomed non-stop through first two books this trilogy . last book took me week plus i extremely annoyed it . i amused philip pullman , his afterword , gives credit stealing his ideas ( those his words ) paradise lost ( john milton ) . frankly , i wish he stolen more , this book would better . his utter hatred church shines through this book . he sort idiot guide quantum mechanics but isn't up it . this mess needs storyboarded , everything not promote story needs chucked out . that half this book . whoever edited this book badly needs chewed out . i suspect , though , it boiled down " not enough time fix " publishing schedule ; del rey not noted publishing messes like this .	1

" bright forever , " unusual it both page-turner skillfully written piece fiction . author , lee martin , tells tale 9 year old girl , youngest member most well-to-do family small indiana town , disappearing while returning library books her bicycle . through four alternating narrators , lengthier connective third-person chapters , we agonizingly learn tragic circumstances what happened . jumping back forth days surrounding principle event , author successfully heightens tension dread narrators slowly reveal everything they know . principle characters their secrets guilt , most mixture good bad . boy relationship his ambitious father , lonely man ambiguous love little girl , teenager forced make choice she'll regret rest her life , older woman who comes painful realization her younger husband may not whom she thinks -- there just so much packed into this relatively short novel . martin also utilizes things like memories nature ( especially birds ) foreshadow parallel main story . perhaps all-encompassing theme how small , seemingly insignificant incidents seem so important when one looks back sees how they all contributed one life-altering event . i highly recommend " bright forever . " it certainly not feel-good book , but it well-written memorable page-turner	1
case " sky walking , " dr. thomas . jones , answer resounding " yes . " this book stands head shoulders above many other works former astronauts terms its story , style substance . immensely readable presented just right level detail , " sky walking " chronicles dr. jones ' spaceflight career , which spanned more than decade included four space shuttle flights . his description sights , sounds sensations his first launch aboard endeavour april 1994 mission sts-59 , which he mission specialist first space radar laboratory flight ( srl-1 ) , best i've ever read . he payload commander srl-2 mission ( sts-68 ) october 1994 , later flew two additional shuttle missions . sts-80 , addition setting shuttle endurance record 18 days orbit , involved satellite deployment retrieval . sts-98 , february 2001 , delivered installed destiny laboratory module international space station ( iss ) , mission which dr. jones made three spacewalks lasting more than 19 hours .

this book not what it says it !! while title suggests it real sternberg williams book , reality , it thin " study guide " real book some clowns called " cram 101 " . i nothing against study guides general , but when book not identified such , i big problem . i shipped something i not expect , i then order real thing wait even longer it arrive . what worse , this book lousy study guide . it sparse collection glossary words each chapter . there no outline or even hint content each chapter , just list generically defined keywords someone thought important relevant chapter , roughly presented order appearance chapter . i needed study concepts real book somehow , so i took those keywords bunch ' net searches try learn topic . this approach didn't work . when i ordered then received real s+w book , i able compare content chapter glossary words , there some important omissions distortions . this book should banned - it waste paper " authors " should ashamed themselves . this " study guide " could cobbled together afternoon third rate college student . if i turned work shoddy one my teachers , i would surely get failing grade . amazon needs change their representation this book , since it suggests you getting somehow bargain priced version real thing . i honestly thought it closeout version , remainder , or other bargain priced book not some shabby attempt study guide real book . avoid this book like plague !	-1
this author unfortunatly gives christians bad name . not only he profess kjv bible only viable translation ( just read introduction ) but he also believes , " satan despised america her unique relationship king james bible ... " ( . 329 ) . i guess he doesn't understand preservation god word or understand greek , but i could wrong . basically my title states it best : stupid people believe anything , anyone who buys this book believes dr. grady truly winner . now i state there few truths dr. grady claims ( probably more than i am even willing admit ) , however structure his book very laughable his broad claims concerning kjv numerous scriputure verses taken out context ruin any chance believability . this book clearly falls under category christian conspiracy theory . i'll leave you one last quote this book summs up my feelings , " exaggerated masonic connection birth our republic led many well-intended conspiracy writers overreact , sometimes brink lunacy " ( . 330 ) . well least he knows how describe himself	-1
i think alot reviewers both sides here no business reviewing this book first place . let me explain this example : if you don't speak french you pick up book written french you probably recognize some words even understand few sentences based knowledge you might basic french because similarity many french words english words ( or whatever language(s ) you know ) . but you won't able completely understand book unless you sit down translate it . it would stupid proclaim book failure just because you don't understand language . same way , you might appreciate beauty french language think book sounds pretty even if you can't understand it , but this no reason claim book masterpiece . we might well consider finnegan wake book written different language we aren't fluent . book ( or any work art , matter ) isn't bad just because you work understand it . may make it frustrating but it doesn't make it bad . so , if you don't think it worth time effort use reading guides or whatever make sense this book , then you should just leave it alone instead going around acting like anything you say book any merit whatsoever . note , it completely absurd review this book just you would book stephen king - based how entertaining storyline or how realistic certain characters - simply because this not what book aiming first place . this would like judging mona lisa piece crap because you're big fan cave drawings showing chain events you didn't see what chain events mona lisa . you judge work based how well it succeeds what it trying , not how well it succeeds what everyone else it trying	1

love him or hate him , dfw prodigious talent . except disturbing " conversations hideous men " i found his previous material so hilariously , intelligently , on-target i willing overlook multitude stylistic transgressions ( chiefly , overly cutesy tone , gratuitous flaunting author erudition , footnote fetish ) . so i reasonably disposed like this book looking forward reading it . sadly , it turns out this case where dfw various idiosyncrasies combine produce book which fundamentally unreadable . normally , once i start book , i feel enormous guilt if i don't finish . no guilt here - just exasperation . one reasonably argue dfw enormous talent might justify certain peculiarities style , but every author needs discipline good editor . w.w. norton seems dispensed editors altogether , certainly sentient kind . pity , because somebody should explained dfw prefacing any section text title " soft-news interpolation , placed here ante rem because this last place it without disrupting juggernaut-like momentum pre-cantor mathematical context " not just completely unhelpful . it irritating distraction , sorry result inability this talented writer vanquish demons which continue plague his undisciplined style . unfortunately , this kind self-indulgent stylistic mannerism recurs infuriating frequncy . result , this book complete train wreck	-1

angela davis talks many different points her book prisons obsolete ? she tries convince audience current u.s. prison system not run adequately . davis questions united states system justice prison system currently houses over two million people throughout nation . her book , she argues prisons not solve crime over past twenty years prison boom not lowered crime rates across country , but intensified criminal behavior . injustices within current prison system , including institutionalized racism , gender inequalities , class segregation thoroughly explored this book . she also debates whether prison reform would enough or prison abolition necessary . this book great piece literature exposes readers little no knowledge prisons some cruel realities . book offers overview history prisons . davis takes example california , state which " landscape thoroughly prisonized over last twenty years " ( davis , 12 ) . this overview extremely important underline davis ' point prisons become ineffective rehabilitatory institutions . although , theoretically , main purpose prison rehabilitate criminals , economic factors well racist motives , quickly drove prison system emulate new way slavery . davis says : " segregation ruled south until it outlawed century after abolition slavery . many people who lived under jim crow could not envision legal system defined racial equality " ( davis , 23 ) . need cheap labor south incited spur legislations promoted incarceration many african americans possible after civil war . these prisoners , then , leased out resulting productive yet cheap laborers . davis touches base racism economic oppression issues chapter two her book . evidence help us understand causes which prisons started proliferate when official studies showed crime rate going down ( davis , 85 ) , professor davis uses fact " many corporations global markets , now rely prisons important source profit " ( davis , 85 ) . all data compiled chapter five davis ' book important explain how prison system embodied prison industrial complex manipulates inmates ' labor exchange economic gain . she attributes so-called " tough crime " legislation private prisons other corporations ' interests . although chapter five bombards reader communist idealism , communist mentality not necessary understand davis ' conclusions . even though not enough facts statistics given book regards problem system , book offers two chapters full first hand information gathered davis . nevertheless , book emphasis proposing prison abolition program should go hand hand prison reform movement ( davis , 9-10 ) . she voice many prison reformers who trying end violence sexual abuse prisons , provide prisoners education so their civil rights not stripped away , most importantly , work prisons part solution not cause problem . her last chapter , professor davis proposes , not so concrete ideas adopt completely different system or correction . this book weakest chapter since it too rhetorical lacks solid proposals . she implies amount knowledge work necessary make solid change fact not very achievable saying : " abolitionist approach seeks answer questions such these would require us imagine constellation alternative strategies institutions " ( davis107 ) , referring questions such " how we imagine society which punishment not based race class ? " (davis107 ) . nonetheless her ideology optimism opens many possibilities could fact effective substitutes incarceration . it all these reasons i recommend this book everyone who interested knowing hidden problems within current u.s. prison system ongoing racial segregation issues . this book makes us think whether or not prisons obsolete . davis thinks they .	1

( rare ) organizational trait focus hiring talented people . only ge my personal experience understood hiring smartest , best , all levels critical success . microsoft leaders legendary their unusual interviewing techniques , all designed hire brightest thinkers . while these traits made company successful , according author they alone not enough take microsoft forward after recent events . one biggest changes bill gates stepping out top role into technology role , steve ballmer taking ceo role . this move may surprising outside , but it seems it allows both what they best . further changes focus developed two broad areas , values customer focus . steve ballmer sought influence talent inside microsoft better work together , more respectful self critical , so . book outlines short list these values . second area even stronger focus customer orientation . these concepts outlined some detail . overall , book easy read , not any way dry my opinion . author credible job portraying events outside influences led " reboot " or transition companies must go through they grow . anyone interested microsoft , book provides interesting overview life cycle organization profound impact world .	1

wilken treats us number pagan apologists including galen , porphyry celsus . these bright , inquisitive men , carefully examining christians roman eyes . romans likewise sensed entity above all other gods , celsus shocked find christians paradoxically " invented " satan power constrain almighty god - act celsus considered blasphemy . ( development this political tool see pagels . ) wilken opens roman world turned our own preferences almost entirely forgotten compiling these authors their own words . striking notion roman religion didn't need replacing when christianity ( hundreds mystery cults same time ) came . but something missing , else why success ? this very opposite brooks adams ' " law civilization decay " . whatever reason , once again we find " they " not so different " us " . one value wilken book read how strongly romans viewed tradition . completely alien modern america , tradition rome everything . what gods your ancestors worshiped one hundred years ago - associated your town or region - precisely same gods worshiped today . add this flood ideas around empire protection what native strong enough kill . then came christians , who like jews , shunned those outside their in-group , insulting fabric community . either tell rome their gods not only wrong but evil , we might expect result . christianity leader claim " those who not hate their parents cannot my disciples " must struck rome it intended , see " new " way ( where " new " not fashionable ) , one no longer associated state religion , glue binding all other traditions . hence , christianity seen rome what it - revolution , though pliny late first / early second century , revolution barely noticed , even tolerated long christians didn't stir things up politically if turned locals adherents took one three opportunities renege faith . tipped off wilken pagles ' stellar study , " origin satan " , one finds early easy flowing style occasionally riveting exposure ancient roman world . despite its modern creation " christians " appears ( usually ) true historical analysis , not postmodern agenda . though this intermittently comes into question wilken states pliny " led exemplary life , embodying highest ideals modern rome . " repeating this theme throughout one wonders how this agrees wilken reporting pliny also executed christians casually we might deposit trash . pliny letters trajan remark executions utter disconnection , otherwise ignored it not pliny rigorous completeness typical ingratiating - not unlike executions anyone else , however . maybe that point , these " roman " standards , though wilken sound generous	1

this book excellent biography james monroe . read biographies several other founding fathers recently , i decided pick this one up well . it very thorough review our fifth president entire life . i found it well not focus monroe doctrine , showing him who he , not history remembers him , simply author doctrine . this book portrays james monroe hard working member republican party , who gradually rose through ranks become evident choice successor his friend fellow virginian , james madison . not because he charismatic or genius , but simply because he good man who served his party well , would not cause infighting amongst other members party . if you're looking learn more our early presidents , all means , pick up this book . but if you're looking book charismatic hero revolutionary era , it certainly isn't going james monroe	1
i throughly enjoyed scoop . it isn't this book some sort hallowed masterpiece nor one those brilliant , brutal satires summarizes absurd actuality particular state or belief . no , scoop just , quite simply , pure fun . story becomes rather obvious after while , but ' obvious ' not cliched or predictable manner , but keeping within consistant vein waugh narrative voice here . oh , sure , there some still relevent statements made regarding incompetence petty biases newspaper men their dictatorial bosses there clearly put case made how newspapers run wealthy industrialists who use their ownership media advance their own selfish agendas , but all this ultimately falls wayside we follow adventures boot , disinterested chronicler seemingly important events he finds himself unable even bother trying understand . this very good book , more like 4 half stars , rounded up , this rare instance , just because it made me laugh out loud more than few times . enjoy-	1

i'm surprised so many feel these cards not appropriate beginner . i suppose it depends reader objective . tarot provides answers querent questions but always positive somewhat elliptical manner . reader forced interpret insights broadest sense . it delivers answers within context how subject question fits into your general life path , interpretation complex abstract . gypsy witch deck supplies more concrete accurate answers ; it pragmatic states facts . this deck highly useful if reader desires yes/no answer or wishes provided timeframes . example , if you ask tarot your current relationship , it may reply relationship him/her important life lesson you , it happy relationship but you need ensure you don't lose your own identity . asking gypsy deck may return answer you receive proposal while vacation expect married within 11 months . this merely my opinion after years practice many would disagree my assessment . i especially like use this deck gain specific insights into other individuals ( optimal accuracy obtained if you know person birthday and/or sign ) . it also true gypsy witch cards mixture positive negative but then again isn't life ? additionally , don't feel obligated use traditional layout your readings . simple five card spreads adequate . both decks excellent tools if you find your energy or thoughts scattered ; both force reader focus . additionally , you'll find practice either deck increase your sensitivity ability empathize emotions those around you . never feel uncomfortable answers you receive , cartomancy merely allows you tap into information already contained your subconscious . there always some controversy surrounding gypsy witch cards regarding original deck , numbers deck person who created them . this information really doesn't matter since you develop your own personal intuitive rapport each card . personally , i can't see myself ever returning tarot cards since i found gypsy witch deck .	1

crick claims investigating consciousness through visual system because he believes visual system more amenable scientific investigation . those who not appreciate this tactic , he sniffily claims , not understand how science operates . it should clear why it often necessary study what experimented first , but this no way validates this particular strategy . crick approach lot like trying understand mechanics car engine studying its wheels . yes , there connection , yes , wheels lot more accessible ( especially if you haven't yet figured out how open hood ) . but you won't necessarily learn very much how engine actually works . closely connected this difficulty his refusal countenance very question what consciousness actually . course , not doing so makes his investigation visual perception `mode ' consciousness much more plausible . if one explicitly refuses define what under investigation , then investigating almost any related phenomena . unfortunately , this mindset not actually serve advance enterprise very far . crick uses glib analogy battle : war , he notes , one not get far trying define what battle when what needed troops strategy . it should go without saying this analogy so deeply flawed useless , except its intended rhetorical purpose . there no need define battle because clearly understood all out outset ; same hardly said consciousness . if one not know what battle objective , fighting it well becomes lot harder . unfortunate plight this book . more specific , it seems relatively apparent whatever else we say consciousness , it involves essentially subjective dimension . crick makes no mention this , except dismiss it something perhaps considered much later . conversely , it far apparent consciousness must involve visual awareness inherently . where this leave blind persons , one might ask ? they not fully conscious ? today we close developing sighted machines , which process navigate three-dimensional environments using lasers or stereoscopic video cameras ( e.g. , darpa challenge ) . these machines therefore approaching consciousness ? this seems patently absurd . book whole reeks lack erudition beyond narrow scientific training . we treated freshman physiology lessons neurons , brain areas basic visual processing , details which both not deep enough real scientific comprehension far more detailed than necessary advancing concepts discussed . times , it reads like undergraduate report which student eager impress not let single fact they uncovered go unreported - no matter if they actually enlighten stated aims or not . sum , most problems this book could fixed single simple but profound change : change title " primer vertebrate visual physiology " , circa 1995 . it probably would not sold many copies way , though .	1
i thought this okay book . it definitely not one my favorites , i wouldn't really recommend it . there some things i liked it some things i didn't like it . one reason i didn't like it because opening scene , main character ( rory ) outside watching her dad cut down tree their yard she talking how great tree . when i first started reading it , i like " okay , she must really like tree , " but after 20 pages her talking this tree , you get annoyed don't want read it anymore . only reason i kept reading it because it school it incredibly easy read so i kept reading . i also didn't like it because i didn't think author described things book too well . when i read book i like know what each character looks like but this story she really didn't give much what people environment like . i also didn't like how they kept talking drawing how draw everything , so got kind boring . so i finished book . it didn't get much better . but there some things i kind liked it . most book , i could really relate what rory going through . i think most girls friend they start lose , most teenage girls off-and-on relationship her parents , so that why i kept reading . way author girls act around boys teachers their parents very realistic so i think anybody reading it knows exactly what characters book going through . i think teenage girls who love draw would like this book .	1

i enjoyed this book immensely now look forward reading more holzer this period . it answered so many questions i messy circumstances surrounding slavery formation country . what i always thought such hypocrisy , i now understand it , incredible lesson human tension reality ideals -- such christian tension so true life , such grand significant scale . rather than merely acknowledging " stain " , indeed it , focus today should triumph overcoming it . his highly detailed telling , holzer over over exposes linclon myths surrounding event , themselves so revealing human tendencies . while deflating so many these myths , doing he so much explain likely origins -- often humourous , sometimes self serving , but always understandable enriching his story . not just myths . one i found particularly poignant repeated occasion son robert who exeter time speech . while it only 4 months since they seen each other , visit robert one lincoln excuses taking time incurring expense going east speak . lincoln ultimately made 10 subsequent stops speak new england his return trip exeter before heading home . while these speeches laid foundation his calculating father ultimate nomination election , robert steadfastly maintained purpose trip see him . i found very touching -- it one thing father your country , but still so your son . heart it all speech itself eager ears , eventually eyes , which took it . while lincoln personality factor , power his words what carried he day . i found this revealing tonic today politics -- altogether different america then . this democracy its best . there clearly , me least , no ideal political system , all manipulated . now hamas victors palestine , i guess even current administration might thinking this . i could go , but won't other than quote following recollection attributed lincoln which might best read thought current schooling mind : i remember how , when mere child , i used get irritated when any body talked me way i could not understand . i don't think i ever got angry anything else my life . . . i remember going my little bedroom , after hearing neighbors talk evening my father , spending no small part night walking up down , trying make out what exact meaning some their , me , dark sayings . i could not sleep , though i often tried , when i got such hunt after idea , until i caught it ; when i thought i got it , i not satisfied until i repeated it over over , until i put it language plain enough , i thought , any boy i knew comprehend . this kind passion me , it stuck me ; i am never easy now , when i am handling thought , till i bounded it north , bounded it south , bounded it east , bounded it west . perhaps accounts characteristic you observe my speeches , though i never put two things together before . ps graduate cooper union , i find holzer account cooper amazing building bit thin . plans photos available web . stage west , not north holzer says , there 18 obstructing columns , not 16 . these inaccuracies not altered my faith his account . i inserted plan hall my copy .	1
this benchmark when it comes books homes frank lloyd wright . text scholarly highly informative , while easily accessable even most nyophite wright follower . images crisp well executed , they just bleed off page . i not always huge fan wright , frankly he racist homophobe , interesting considering most his devotees taliesin where gay , man voratious ego would make donald blush . he all accounts just nasty piece work , i first found his architecture austere cold , but now i am huge admiror his work , if not man . this book shows vivid focus , what makes his homes so unique what made him american icon . i may not think much wright man , but his work ages this book simply fantastic . highly recommended .	1

although this book ostensibly " beginner " book flash actionscript ( no previous programming experience necessary ) , i got more out this book than you imagine , i'm not it yet . i've already got few favorite pages i come back again again . what struck me right off bat this book wasn't code-heavy , but much more way explanations than most books , which exactly what i seeking long time now . then , i got into it , i realized this book changing my whole way thinking coding flash actionscript , it because their heavy stress " modular " coding techniques . authors call it " black box " programming making " building blocks " code . it really encapsulation . whatever you want call it , they back it up solid examples . demonstration apply () method pages 360 361 alone worth price book ! pages 308 309 , there example making movie clip containing video controls you just drag drop into any movie , bingo ! you've got set controls movie ( play , stop , pause , fastforward , rewind ) . again , idea if you build something once , you should able reuse it , minor tweaking here there . chapter 10 , games sprites , really cool ! there fully functioning " zapper " arcade-type video game complete explanation rationale behind how something like designed coded , what variables should global , which ones belong _root , which should stay local each object ( all examples book downloaded publisher website , btw . fact , you download examples even if you haven't yet bought book ) . although lot stuff earlier chapters very basic , taking you through stuff like variables , arrays , loops , conditionals , etc , stress modularity woven throughout . main idea you come away ( certainly central idea book ) it worth time it takes design plan something modularly . even though first it take longer , end you wind up something that way easier modify . now , i say all my own perspective , i'm probably intermediate level programmer . so maybe stuff i'm saying this book it stress modularity would old hat pro . i don't know . then again , i've got 8 books actionscript , each one stuff unique itself , this one things it just aren't found others . all through book , there also ongoing project building modular flash website . i haven't gotten into working yet , but i'm sure i eventually ( i've book month ) . any case , they add little more project end each chapter , so it progresses into more advanced stuff same pace rest book . there basic introduction classes oop last chapter . it should understood it not extensive , that not focus this book anyway . it tie stress modularity , there good explanations when how you might use classes your programming . but if want material specifically classes , there other books make their focus . sum up : i would recommend this book beginner intermediate programmers . although much stuff earlier chapters probably rehash what you already know , stress modularity there beginning , there good material throughout . if you've heard modular code code reuse , but never really seen good examples it , open this book some pages i mentioned above ( 308 , 356 , 360 , 361 , 364 ) see if any it registers " aha " moment . also , if you're looking bit less code lot more explanation techniques , get this book . i also recommend " foundation actionscript animation : making things move " keith peters , same publisher	1

i admit i little disappointed this book . idea revolutionary necessary modern society : generation parents who genuinely talk their children sex maintain open reasonable dialogue throughout their child life . roffman good job arguing why we need this . what she not well , my opinion , get point : just how we instill these dialogues into our relationships our children ? after pages told how important it , i frustrated not find how she recommends going it . so i skipped around . however , due poor organization her book , i no idea where skip . i left it back library i got it only vague idea how she recommended i speak my child . don't get me wrong : her stories good there few i feel glad knowing . but she simply not get point soon enough . path her narrative wandering her direction times unclear . i simply could not sit through it long enough give her chance get . . . point . after some disappointment some searching , i found book * * get point : -everything you never wanted your kids know sex ( but afraid they'd ask)-by justin richardson mark schuster while roffman advantage many first-hand discussions parents children , richardson schuster advantage not only but also enlightening statistical , psychological , sociological research . not mention much more straight-forward writing style . i applaud roffman efforts difficult topic . but this simply not book read . i wish she would organize her personal stories so i could find ones topics i'm interested assimilate them . but unfortunately , i not time dig through all them find ones i feel relevant	1

this book churchill lays out his case against white progressives , who he feels oblivious ineffectiveness their efforts . he indicts them phony pacifism seeks not embrace risk confrontation state power , but rather , avoid risk entirely effort substitute feel good symbolism real change . he suggests most white progressives kidding themselves favoring revolutionary change . their simplistic ideas delusional their " comfort-zone " politics self-serving . churchill frustration rituals marching circles , " demanding " change carrying signs , lighting candles peace certainly understandable . he right such tactics impotent without force exercised somewhere else . his prescription white progressives become intimately acquainted this fact through kind " revolutionary therapy " strips away many layers pseudo-pacifist illusion very short order . churchill not call abandonment nonviolent action , merely recognition without force part equation other tactics doomed failure . i can't dispute essence what he says , but think he overplays violence angle . while not due pacifist action per se we nevertheless examples sweeping social change occurring without violent revolution . . . . . iranian revolution ( 1979 ) , collapse ussr ( 1991 ) , end apartheid . . . i think arundhati roy got it right her speech new york just after u.s. invasion iraq 2003 . she said there no way defeat empire force its component parts must isolated paralyzed one one .	1

this well-written book logically moves through certain events where america needed act , those actions either increasing or decreasing odds 9/11 happening . graham book shows bureaucratic silos focused departments themselves , rather than objectives like national security , allowed 9/11 happen . case cross-functional organizations focus intelligence security objectives well-made graham this book . i also appreciated his perspective committee chairman senate select intelligence committee . graham provides great insight into workings senate , especially also monitoring specific executive bureaucracies . while i agree him better reagan/bush/clinton/bush focus terrorism would prevented 9/11 , bush executive branch many opportunities stop 9/11 , i don't agree graham final thesis bush alone could stopped 9/11 . i would suggest however most what graham recommends happening executive branch happening , just not quickly potentially necessary since we spent spending inordinate amount men , money , material iraq rather than fighting terrorism securing our country terrorism	1
i went my university library tried compare goldrei book almost all other popular accounts set theory , prior investing my time learning basics subject . after almost finished reading it , i believe this model how textbooks mathematics should written . let me little bit more specific : 1)suberb organization material . ideas built gradually without logical gaps or regressions . definitions theorems clearly stated . " what follows what " always transparent . even choice paragraphs so well thought , one easilly assign title each them quick reference later . 2)each subject clearly introduced within its historical logical context . each theorem ( even exercise ) motivated its importance its merits global picture set theory . 3)the logic intuition behind proofs given ( well proof itself ... ) well organized not unecessarily wordy manner . 4 ) there exercises within main text ( which , usual , well motivated their importance ) solutions folowing right after . this way , one may develop skills understanding , without getting frustrated or spending too much time . there also exercises end each section which interesting not too difficult . 5 ) there comments aside main text , which range ideas concerning proof historical remarks or recommendations reader . this way , main text remains clean tangencies , but never dry . i could continue praising this book , but let me cut it short saying just this : it one those proper ( i.e. rigorous ) math textbooks invite you read each following chapter turn each page see what next . finished it i feel i pretty firm understatnding basics . i only wish goldrei could write second book specialized topics ( say , similar topics covered devlin " joy sets " , or moschovakis ' book ) , same energy enthousiasm wrote this one	1

sadly , chicago poems ( 1916 ) , author first published work , book which self-styled folk poet carl sandburg best remembered today . collection takes hard unswerving look grim realities urban life common man , funneled through flume author committed socialist ideological perspective . such approach poetry may somewhat novel america time , both history critics kind sandburg sympathetic portraits human suffering . but whether he addressing " dago shovelman , " immigrant who forgotten dignified his ancestors europe or who no longer recognize " new-mown hay smell calling wind , " street walker " haggard poems desperate eyes , " or young woman burned death factory fire , sandburg continually adopts simplistic notion lower economic strata society always victimized but virtuous , while governmental institutions , bosses all stripes , professional classes , wealthy uniformly cruel , oppressive , exploitive , , best , indifferent . thus , chicago poems reads like 132-page polemic very narrow political point view . while many author observations poignantly insightful ( such poverty-stricken family dead boy ' right grief , ' who " glad it gone , rest family now more eat wear " ) , poems , when read together , take oppressively unbalanced character their own . ' fence , ' example , " rabble all vagabonds hungry men wandering children looking place play " stand outside gates newly constructed " stone house lake front " built wealthy man , who , poet infers , nothing but immoral , amoral , or corrupt . author usher-esque vision , nothing able pass through gates property except " death rain tomorrow . " tomorrow , such corrupt individual or family , inevitably bring nothing but waves bad conscience fevered isolation . ' soiled dove ' examines life woman who " not harlot until she married corporation lawyer , " but who automatically becomes one acquiescing such marriage , who soon discovers her husband also loves " six other women , " if marital infidelity limited exclusively upper economic classes . contrast , ' happiness ' confidently represented " crowd hungarians under trees their women children keg beer accordion , " image which may seem simultaneously na�ve , patronizing , condescending many readers . occasionally , sandburg wisely acknowledges some portion tragedies man existence simply inherent natural human life cycle . " hand god " also comes blame several poems . chicago poems most effective when sandburg bypasses social divisionalism -- he often his later volumes poetry -- simply addresses everyman individual . while these poems often infused lyrical tender sentimentality slightly reminiscent james whitcomb riley , they also locate acknowledge beautiful within tragedies perpetually arise human frailty , vulnerability , mortality . ' dream dusk , ' author warns " tears loss broken dreams may find your heart dusk , " while ' under harvest moon ' identifies " death " " gray mocker , [ who ] comes you beautiful friend who remembers . " ' i sang ' describes lover who given up his heart " you moon , " but " only moon remembers , kind me . " other poems more pronounced folk character sandburg later volumes . speaker ' theme yellow ' pumpkin , who celebrates paganistic dance children around him " last day october ... singing ghost songs love harvest moon ... i am jack-o-lantern terrible teeth children know i am fooling . " most recent edition complete poems carl sandburg ( 2003 ) , which contains chicago poems its entirety , 832 pages long , provides its readership full range sandburg original often gloriously rich sensual vision life . it also contains works like ' gates tombs , ' slabs sunburnt west ( 1922 ) , which sandburg , " crazy wild dreamer , " more fully maturely developed his political vision . comparatively , reductive , often despairing chicago poems reads like immaturely polarized work it .	1
