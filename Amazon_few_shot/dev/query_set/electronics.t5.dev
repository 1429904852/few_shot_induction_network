i bought this headset retailer ( offline ) , returned it next day . first off , i make it clear i no problems sound . even though speakers could just tiny bit bigger ( they use 40mm drivers ) , sound quality headset just fine . however , when it comes wearing these headphones , only words come mind " uncomfortable sin " . awkward squarish shape cups made it hard get any kind decent seal around ears ( bad seal closed-back headphones ultimately leads poor sound isolation ) . also , i no idea what material they used cup pads , but it nowhere near soft enough ... fact , i litterally couldn't wear these things more than five minutes without my ears turning red ( flush ) discomfort . mind you , i also own cheap pair koss headphones i keep hours time , so my ears definitely no stranger cupped speakers either ... but these things , they just plain hurt wear after very short period time , which isn't good all . discomfort unable obtain good seal around ears ultimately main reasons return . if your ears tough , you should no problem this headset . sound quality decent it should work just fine you . however , if you're looking comfort good sound isolation , you'll want look elsewhere ..	-1

i bought this receiver use preamp my system . i based my decision information stated pioneer web site , attractive price compared some other options i considered . this receiver number good features , but one serious flaw . it not display screen status messages daily operations , like volume sound mode , unless you pioneer display , run special cable receiver tv ( side note , pioneer needs understand we want run less cables our display ) . means you only get see simple set-up screen your non-pioneer tv , which you probably use when you first set up receiver , very infrequently after . ( set-up menu lets you set things like assignable inputs , audio calibtraion . ) sounds like small deal , but many home theaters , including mine , electronics not line site ( mine closet just outside theater infrared repeater system controlling everything . ) this not uncommon , many thier electronics isolated like me or behind cabninet doors , it means i no idea what volume , what sound mode i am using , or anything beyond set-up menu unless i go into closet . bad , bad , bad ! this seems marketing ploy pioneer get you buy pioneer tv projectors , it beyond stupid . if this not case i would rate this receiver much higher , but it serious flaw . it makes using this unit extremely tedious difficul t.t his limitation also means , if you mulitple displays , i plasma tv projector my theater , you need run thier special cable both displays , both pioneer . again , i say bad , bad , bad ! other features stated pioneer website , but they lying when they say this unit screen display , this major drawback users not receiver line site when using thier systems , unless they pioneer display sr+ . ( oh yeah , your pioneer display also equipped sr+ , thier way linking two units . if your pioneer display not equipped sr+ , you again out luck . i mention this bad ?! )25 feb 2007 - addition reveiw : i called onecall they take unit back , but 15% restocking fee , plus paying shipping both ways . while onecall really nothing wrong ( pioneer lying osd ! ) , it one thier vendors not customer fault either customer should not pay this kind fraud . buyer beware onecall , thier customer service this one not good	-1

i pretty excited this player , read it runners ' world . there lot problems it , however . while it advertised sports mp3 player , lot respects it isn't very convenient someone who buys it sports . my issues : - headphones not all appropriate sports , particularly running .. they keep falling off , so i invest better pair headphones . kind weird since it supposed sports player . also , i spent least five minutes everytime untangling them before i could use them . - hard change music while running , it often ends up doing something i don't want it . you can't change music without removing mp3 player armband , which major pain just function bad design you can't tell any picture . - not easy figure out features player , such stopwatch , pedometer . also hard use once you figure it out . - software pain use . - organization songs annoying difficult maneuever player . said , i still use it . there some good features : - long battery life , recharges super quick- very cool-looking player- very easy carry around .. slip it pocket or bag any size . i would not recommend this player if given choice , i would not buy it again .	-1

beware kingston rebates ! course , i hope your experience would differ , if you buy kingston product(s ) , but mine terrible . i bought kingston compactflash card offered $50 mail-in rebate . i promptly ( , day after i received item delivery ) went photocopy my rebate certificate upc code sales receipt ; then sent it all its merry way . yes , i well within rebate period , both purchase postmark date . my purchase valid retailer ( think huge online e-tailer ) . rebate required sending entire original upc label , which like entire outside package my cf card , size 1 � business cards when flattened . no problem . two months later , i get letter saying " your rebate request denied because you failed furnish appropriate original upc code required rebate offer . " well , now what ? i can't re-send original ( it already their possession ) . i called , they insisted repeating what letter said . i re-sent my photocopies they said photocopy invalid proof purchase . after 6 weeks pursuing this , i figured this their scam . they simply wouldn't honor rebate . without original upc my possession , i couldn't really submit their requirements . if you're looking ram upgrade , i'd suggest you look quality company like ocz ( best ! ) , or patriot , geil , or corsair . if you're looking value flash memory card , i might suggest sandisk . one , kingston not make best products , they value-driven products . two , there competitors kingston just good or better value-to-performance ratios same prices . three , kingston not stand behind their customer i experienced . i urge you , please , cautious kingston their rebate scams	-1

these $10 headphones . there nothing amazing them my opinion . i bought them use my ipod when i'm out , or work . right out box , i disappointed fit , i know everyone going different , but me they just aren't comfortable . sound quality clear , but very thin lacking bass . even when i'm pressing them into my ears get best possible fit , bass just isn't good . eq settings boost bass don't help either , often reduce sound quality even more . ear clips don't really seem much either . they kind keep them your ears but don't really hold them your ears all . ear pieces tend get tangled together easily well . summary , i wouldn't recommend these music , but if you want cheap pair headphones listening audio books or some other kind spoken word , they might good-if you tolerate them your ears long	-1

belkin tunetalk fabuous using ipod digital recorder . i very good results recording various music rehearsals ( children choir big band ) without external powered microphone ( sony ecm-ms908c stereo mic ) attached . since i already mic , total cost very low compared purchasing something like zoom digital recorder this type recording . i haven't plugged it into mixing board yet . i suspect it would produce even better recording decent pair mics through mackie 1202 or better . i bought usb power adaptor so i wouldn't worry battery drain . it plugs into tunetalk provides power ipod . no , it isn't good high dollar recorder , dedicated mic-pre pair neumann mics . serious recording requires serious equipment . however , all those other recordings , tunetalk stereo great recording option $60 your trusty ipod .	1

i've used sd-yd250 hundreds times over last 2 years it still shows no significant signs wear . overall , product five star because its reliability labor-saving convenience . i've used it equally baking bread making pizza dough . it also save lot money , provided you purchase yeast bulk ( example 2lb ) . single use yeast packages which typically only buying option american supermarkets cost 20 times more per gram . particularly great savings possible when using it make pizza dough . this takes tedious work out making your own pizza , when dough refrigerated later use , it tastes even better my opinion . like most engineered products our age , this one full cute features add little value , or cause annoyance . yeast dispenser makes marginal difference best . if you use it , you ( most part ) create extra work yourself because you'll clean it later . dozens different bake modes make product more complicated use . they make marginal difference baking results . i only use quick bake mode , which takes 2 hours complete . let say you make mistake start unit using wrong settings ( easy given many parameters you set ) . you just push reset or cancel button start over , right ? nope , no such button exists . then unplug unit plug it back , right ? nope , engineers decided it would cute feature protect against power outages , so unit remembers where it left off . yes , but instruction manual states you wait 10 minutes , after 10 minutes it forget , right ? nope , i tried this , too . unit indeed forget eventually , but it more than 11 minutes . if you plug it back too early , timer resets you wait again . summarize , hardware excellent , software controls it could hardly dumber	1

i bit skeptical this purchase , although i previously owned one first harmony remotes pre-logitech days very pleased it . some reviews bit off-putting , particularly 890 its rf option , so i went 880 i am glad i . despite comments others on-line programming superb - all my components already database . certainly i very familiar process programmed my first remote through 3 evolutions components before selling it total package . any event process hassle free i now fully integrated control my replay tv , cable box , tv , receiver , dvd vcr just i hoped . control process seamless , provided you realize remote sending stream ir commands needs kept pointed system until remote tells you command complete all works great . ( fact remote tells you keep pointing system great improvement over my prior unit . ) my only slight critique remote not similar prompt when you switch off so you inadvertently move remote too quickly leave something should off . however help process quickly resolve this when you switch again . rechargeable batteries good innovation too - i no problem locating unit charging base . overall i thoroughly recommend 880 .	1
this fashionable keyboard spruce up any workstation or gaming environment compared typical ho-hum keyboard . lcd screen nice feature ( toy ) but i find myself rarely using it most apps games don't support it . two usb ports very handy would especially so anyone without frontside usb their towers . it worth buying anyone situation . blue lighting keys make them easier read dim room but doesn't help much truly dark room . macro keys plentiful easy use . all-in-all well worth buy anyone wanting something looks nicer then typical keyboard , anyone needing easy access usb ports anyone needing macro keys . people may also want give new vista keyboard microsoft look	-1
i little tentative order itrip lcd because some bad reviews i read . it seems like there very few people sitting fence this item . buyers either love it or hate it . i leaving trip hoped itrip would arrive so i could use it my drive . luck would it , it my mailbox day before i left . i unwrapped it went out vehicle test it . i plugged it into my 20gb ipod photo right off bat thought i trouble . it wouldn't power up , i tried plugging unplugging , cleaning contacts finally last resort , read instructions . after plugging it you play song before it power . this immediately explains why so many poeple complain doas right out box . i set frequency lowest available fm band presto !!! instant music . i don't live extremely populated area so i can't really comment other stations bleeding through but loud passages loud quiet passages quiet . many reviewers complained bad sound quality but you must remember this . it doesn't matter how great quality song your ipod , you playing it over fm radio so it never sound better than fm radio . i inherited my father ' 91 accord work car when he retired it bare bones am/fm radio tone control(bass treble all rolled into one handy knob !!! ) cheap 6 1/2 inch speakers front doors . when i drive i like listen talk radio podcasts occasionally music . sound quality exactly what i expected , no better no worse . i also tested it my wife ' 01 focus . it nice factory 6 speaker cd system sound ipod just fine . bass still thumped highs seemed just tiny bit off but still not bad all . i am completely satisfied product . one strange thing i noticed may explain why some people complain bad sound quality if you tap itrip , sound comes through your speakers much like tapping microphone . if you lay it hard surface your vehicle you could probably hear it through your speakers when encountering rough road . unless there defective batch sent out , i don't know where all complaints come . i got mine $15 private seller amazon consider it great purchase especially amount money . don't hesitate buy one , it works advertised sound quality what it . if you keep these things mind , you won't disappointed	-1
it speedy space saving inexpensive . i bought this replace my belkin because belkin needed plugged . this one powered your computer so there no extra power cords , which big plus me . only thing i dislike this fact hub takes up two usb ports instead just one like belkin .	1

i like features . i'm satisfied sound . user interface could more intuitive . however , my overriding complaint docking port ( many other reviewers mentioned ) not reliable . connection poorly constructed , so just walking table which it sits often enough make it think ipod isn't there any more . if they could fix this quality problem , it would well worth $100 , but since it very hard get it recognize connection reliably you just can't justify it any price	-1

this review little long-winded , but i am going share you my experiences after burning hundreds dvds . after all , many us archiving data / video we want able access decades into future currently there no other reviews this product site . i used just every type recordable dvd media available concluded fuji offers best value . i recommend you stick fuji dvd-rs made japan . this important since there multiple manufacturers who make recordable dvds fuji ( not uncommon industry ) . end user , dvds different manufacturers ( all under fuji name ) look nearly identical . you might want take time google then download free utility program named dvd identifier . you simply put your recordable dvd into your computer dvd writer dvd identifier tell you who actually manufactured dvd ( many you might surprised brand name disc actual manufacturer often different ) . example , fuji dvds made japan made taiyo yuden ( one - if not most - reputable manufacturers out there ) . fuji dvds made taiwan made entirely different manufacturer . both japan taiwan fuji dvds look nearly identical packaging share common proof purchase code . however , one set note made japan under proof purchase code other set note made taiwan under proof purchase code . other way distinguish packages made japan dvds plastic spindle cover flush against black spindle base . made taiwan dvds black base stick out slightly . i heard some people say digital digital all dvds created equal . this not true . you want buy dvd manufactured quality . you might save few cents buying cheaper dvd ; however , you factor bad burns lost data . cheapo dvds , you more coasters more dvds initially burn fine , but lose data after few months . past two years , i burned over 1,000 made japan fuji dvds only six bad burns not yet experienced lost data any hundreds successful recordings . i use these fuji dvds more than any other brand . i also use panasonic dvd-rs ( also manufactured taiyo yuden ) well unlabeled dvds online wholesaler also manufactured taiyo yuden . fuji dvds attractive silver color top , panasonics attractive gold color top . panasonic dvds also much more expensive than fujis . terms compatibility , i played fuji dvds over 20 different dvd players yet find player not play my video recorded fuji dvd . 50 pack fuji spindle regularly goes sale $20 variety retailers .	1

this very well designed . it give you 4 usb port but two opposite sides . this very clever becase you plug devices both sides . you webcam or cell your left your mouse number pad your right . cord plug hub computer very sterdy yet flexible so you not only adjust hub all kind angles , it would stay angle not twist all around you wires . it also works great if you jsut want charge you usb devices go . it come plug ac adapter so you don't need bring your computer you charge youd devices	1
well , begin , i am complete ipod hater . whole idea wasting buttload money something limited features doesn't sit right me . but after robbing my bro his so long , since i none , it time get something my own . i chose this walkman bean player . size sick ! fits few fingers . also , it sony , trusted company , unlike apple who give you runaround . navigation menu so simple . i didn't read manual i figured it out . only thing i read manual figue how change station radio , but negligible . anyhow , i looooove it . great bargain , sound investment	1
guess you sometimes pick good one over hundreds bad ones ... i might say i lucky .... or price this litte lcd worth price paid ... this lcd filling 2 pairs shoes very nicely ... it used kitchen tv used computer monitor .. very satisfied tv picture .. very clear sharp .. great picture .. good back lighting , not dull or dim some other lcd i've seen ... sound ok but little thin my liking so i added some cheap amplified speakers which really helps .. great computer monitor also .. just clear functional my high end hp monitor .. refreshes 60hz no issues .... would i buy again .. or ... perhaps but i would test it out before purchase if all possible ... there some bad apples every bunch .. overall my purchase this lcd tv complete success my needs ..	1

this 1st ipod i've ever , i've using it constantly since purchase 3 months ago ( gym , work , commuting , planes ) . no real problems so far . size excellent , look sheek , navigating wheel lot easier use than i told it going . battery life not too bad , i would say it used 10 hours before battery picture turns red . i am dissapointed capacity- 500 songs really nothing people who've buying cds 10+ years enjoy variation their listenting sessions . i also dissapointed you can't anything playlists ipod itself- basically everything ( eg , creation playlists , deletion songs , moving around songs ) computer uploaded ipod . recommended gym-goers frequent travelers	1

this card 2 gb ultimate 120x it tested write speed 120 times 150kb/sec which exceeds 18 mb per second . frequently card manufacturers advertise their read speed , which always much faster . analyze your file size pictures you take speed mb/sec tell you how many those pictures you store one second . impacts time pictures . cameras , write speed most important , but speed rating card doesn't necessarily tell you its write speed . music players other devices , read speed may more important . so you might choose different card depending whether you intend use it play music or take pictures . i'm currently shopping sd cards camera capability shoot 3 pictures per second large file sizes . order not slow camera down , i need fast card . i some research realized reviews here aren't necessarily even related this particular card , but all different sizes speeds kingston cards . kingston memory business long time they conservative their ratings . this card #1 my list right now because its tested write speed	1

some people seem issues but i loved mine . i live boston area itrip always worked fine 88.3 - 88.5 range . not fantastic sound but more than adequate . portability huge plus well - i used it playing my ipod over radios hotel rooms when traveling , radios friends ' houses , . itrip considerably more useful than tape player adaptor far more reliable . i never found tape player adaptor worked well consistently . price convenience you can't beat this thing . only drawback it not work newer generation ipods	-1
this review pertains specifically targus pauh217u 4 port ultra mini usb 2.0 hub . cord 2.5 feet long - long enough reach my pc , which sits ground , top desk . it cable which split into two usb plugs - one just transmit data , second power unit . second plug not need used unless you plan using some heavy-duty hardware , if so what you buying hub called ultra mini anyways ? if you insist trying run blow dryer off thing , then it input separate power source , which you buy separately . short , if you old school machine usb ports which inaccessible /inconvenient use , this little hub give you quick access while taking up minimal space your desk	1
you never ask more this product . 2700mah . that huge . runs my discman weeks ( i roughly listen 1 hr everyday ) . digital display very good accurate . refresh feature what makes it different other similar products . now forget " memory " bug your battery . given price , it worth your while	1

i bought this product after reading several reviews here amazon . setup configure it my cable system little tricky , but once we got passed , it worked like charm . i only lost one recording one my dvds . it strange how happened , since dvd wasn't player time . but almost year ago it hasn't happened since then . this recorder intuitive simple operate . conversion video dvd flawless , finalization process easy understand well . i especially like how you adjust recording time . mine currently set four hours . i am totally blind needed product easy me operate without sighted assistance . this definitely fills bill ! if you're looking great product reasonable price , buy this one ! you won't disappointed ! i've converted almost 50 videos recorded several tv shows this recorder ! great buy	1

i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
after going through reviews , i bought this cf card my canon digital rebel . so far it worked fine , though i don't pretend expert digital photographer . when card empty , it shows 127 shots available . it seems read reasonably fast , though it takes bit longer than i used my point-and-shoot olympus its smartmedia card .	1
got my order quickly found out these cases much better than ones sold here locally , they cheaper !!	1
its very helpfull when you manage several sd cards , its faster very reliable !	1
i make this review very simple . no matter what features you find attractive this remote , its shear size makes thing clunky unuseable . unless you large hands , you trouble accessing all buttons without 2 handing it . ( make sure you go retail store hold it first before you buy it)in terms features , remote only simplest " learning " features . if you want custom interface piece hardware it doesn't code .... good luck	-1
i've it over month now it works well i expected it work . i expecting random quirks here there i continued using it , but none whatsoever	1

first short background - tv i previous panasonic plasma 50 " panasonic rear projection lcd three years old . source materials i regularly view consist dish satellite tv using s-video dvd/wii/xbox 360 using component video . after much deliberation , i decided go plasma over lcd due cost better pq , although cheaper , i avoided lcos/dlp due poor viewing angles other pq issues similar those i my rp-lcd . i ended up choosing panasonic over pioneer models due significantly cheaper price because it only missing some very minor enhancements comparable pioneer models . th-50px60u awesome i don't regret purchase all . i would say it best bang buck far plasma arena . all said , i some advice potential buyers . these tvs most sensitive first 100 hours use still require some care precautions taken during following 400 hours use . reduce likelihood image retention it highly recommended not play video games static status bars and/or huds extended periods ( i'd say 1hr plus ) , use zoom aspect ratio adjust picture so station id logos covered watch letterboxed dvds zoom function during first 100-ish hours . doing some investigation online should lead you breakin dvd used accelerate breakin time slightly make sure all phosphors lit evenly across entire panel . hopefully some you find this information helpful	1

i purchased this card use my fujifilm finepix s5000 camera family vacation . i researched it beforehand make sure i could use this card camera . there " " " " card ( apparently , they save things different format " " card not allow taking videos this camera ) . i purchased " " card , used it mostly take still photos . upon returning home downloading photos ( 505 ) my computer , i extremely disappointed find once i copied them my computer , i unable view them my camera anymore ( i not choose erase them card ) . i got error message camera , my only choice format card ( which meant everything would erased ) . i wasn't happy , but i couldn't view photos anyway , so i format it . one problem . other problem i several photos displayed question marks my computer , no image all . others looked fine thumbnails , but when opened , top half them fine , but bottom half either solid gray , or spliced repeated . it crazy ! these memories can't recaptured , so it very upsetting . i not trust card all , i not purchase one !	-1
this if my first flat screen tv but after much research i determimed this one most bang buck . so far so good , i am very pleased picture sound quality . most reviews i read lcd tvs point out issue black contrast . one thing i increase brightness level almost max order bring out contrast when viewing shows dark scenes but level seems work ok all viewing . i highly recommend this product	1
this uber-sleeve or micro-attache sound , good looking ruugedly constructed - no complaints there . however , attache it comes up short . it so perfectly sized my macbook pro 15.4 " laptop , there virtually no room there anything else . some papers , maybe dvd or two , but that it . there not even close enough space bring my power supply . once already once i left my bag all packed , only discover i also eft my power supply behind . ok , so maybe it just sleeve ... except it ever so slightly too big comfortably fit inside my oversized messenger bag ! what up !! i find i wind up going places two bags , feels bit silly . nice included ( but uneeded ) padded sholder-strap went straight my binoculars . all alternatives i found shopping around online , this one still seems best , but there one futuristic black ? orange molded neoprene skin-snug case merits deeper inspection . perhaps case ( also designed specificaly macbook pro ) more streamlined its exterior dimensions . good news brenthaven edge ii , i know my gear well protected . conclusion : nothing perfect	-1
i highly recommend bose wave radio ii after one month , here pros cons : pros : * excellent sound quality volume . plays full sound spectrum well - deep bass notes high octave soprano . turn volume up " very loud " before sound distortion audible , so it easy listen radio one room while working or while cleaning house . * small space requirements . easily fits top bedside cabinet bedside lamp . remote control right-sized too , only slightly larger than credit card . * good features . alarm clock works well input jack comes handy if you want listen cd or xm satellite radio through portable external player . * ease use . very intuitive easy-to-use design remote control radio , able use everything without referencing product manual . * esthetics envy . this radio looks great , people ask it when they see it . * resale value . you won't find used bose wave radio cheap ebay or amazon marketplace , bose radios tend hold their resale value well over time . * made america . you may feel more patriotic after buying it . cons : * cost . definitely more expensive than other radios , but considering quality resale value , it probably good value overall . if you rewards credit card , radio might obtained ( " free " ) using accumulated credit card points -- many credit card points catalogs ( i.e. , diners club rewards catalog ) wave radi o.o verall , excellent product highly recommended . keep up good work bose	1

i netgear router this wireless usb adapter . i used router wgt624 several months just firewall directly hooked into my computer never any problems . few days ago however i moved my computer decided use this usb card nothing but problems since . half time start up my computer not connected so i reboot . sometimes multiple reboots then it still doesn't work i unhook everything , router , cable modem , etc . i don't know how or why this happens but it seems make everything stuck nothing communicate again until i this . this happened several times so i am not imagining this . i try various things but ultimately i shut everything down actually unplug modem power source few seconds then start everything back up . i cable this procedure they you sometimes if things get locked up , usually when you bad connection . i didn't this when it just hooked into router , but this usb p.o.s. i am doing it every day , sometimes several times day . then it shows connection like 55% router very next room . door open , not 20 feet away . even now i sit here writing this little computer task bar showing my connection dropped yellow . least it hasn't changed red ........... crap , just , not #%^%$ kidding ! ..................... okay , back line . this absolute p.o.s. which i would take back except i got it package deal router i bought it long time ago but never used it till now . when it work it quick . but when key word there . yourself favor , buy something else ! don't corporations test this crap before they mass market it ?!?	-1

i love this product . i purchased edge 305 go new bike , it easy install , decent instructions . it easy get started using it . it gives all information you could possibly want your ride , its simple download . some people might think its too much information , but you tailor data fields displayed see little or much info you want . data ( milage , elevation ) appears very accurate . down side , display hard read sunlight . i've played around contrast tool , but still problems . i also think use instructions could clearer , my first ride , i couldn't figure out why i wasn't getting milage , later realized you turn it ! i'm used bike computers start automatically . changing data fields displayed bit pain , i want timer showing when i'm indoor trainer , % grade when i'm road , its pain constantly switch fields . also , if data field not displayed because you don't need see it constantly , ( average speed comes mind ) you change data fields displayed view info , then change back if you not end your ride . i am fortunate because several people my bike club edge 305 they could answer questions so i didn't constantly thumb through instruction manual . software comes edge very basic , but i no complaints it . all issues i mentioned above annoyances rather than problems i feel this great product i recommend it anyone who not intimidated all features .	1

i found myself position where i needed convert over 50 long audio cassettes several dats cd possibly mp3 later . prospect use my computer not inviting , i need computer other things it would forced me buy large drive deal files . after some research into few cd recorders available judging other reviews here , i decided go this model since it around same price hard drive i would needed . this couldn't simpler device use . especially my dat player , hook up supplied optical cable , adjust audio level record . it automatically creates tracks , either silent areas certain length or track divisions encoded dat . audio cassettes little more tricky automatic track division only activated if tape hiss below certain db . easy adjustment fix . anyway , creation cd couldn't easier : push record ( it activates pause mode ) , start your playback deck , release pause , leave it alone until playback finished , hit stop activate finalization . minute ten seconds later you cd . so hour playback takes hour five minutes create cd . much faster then computer . audio quality excellent my ear . there three issues note . first , unit only accepts music cd-r discs which not available data cd-r discs even nyc . second , unit sometimes not playback just finalized disc goes into error mode , reboot recorder fixes problem disc plays perfectly . i haven't discovered reason but i suspect tdk blanks i am using . third , unit not recognize end last track you recording if you aren't careful you could end up very long final track . it would nice if there option recorder would stop recording if there programmable length silence . i now set cds play any cd player i easily convert mp3 computer when time comes . saved lot time aggravation	-1

i don't much basis comparison , my only other hd antenna unamplified plastic metal 8 " triangle jobbie came my receiver . i researched heavily before settling terk-sp . it works great , but not perfect i might hoped . i live major city where every station hd version , i've always able get them all , but signal typically so weak some stations , they would constantly cut out me . strong outdoor antenna solved problem almost completely . cheap indoor antenna i before picked up all same channels , but sporadic connectivity . i constantly moving it around improve weak signal . real pain . when i got terk-sp , first thing i noticed it pretty light . plastic cover plastic backing even pear-shaped picture-hook eyehole back hanging antenna wall . pretty unique idea . it " amplified " antenna , but refers design . it doesn't plug into wall socket or anything or use any extra power . one thing i really like this antenna way it looks ... like square satellite dish . i live apartment among sea dishes , so unique terk-sp really stands out ( 16 " , it same size too ) . package includes mounting arm adjustable bracket . it not include grounding rod or grounding block ( get both radio shack $14 $5 respectively ) . if you mounting this antenna outdoors , you need them . static electricity builds up inside coax cable ( this true all antennas ) fry your tv ( i discovered this hard way , accidentally touching cable my hand after few days use shocking living daylights out my thumb ! ) your coax antenna cable needs go terk " mounting block " you place grounding rod you sink ground , then run second wire other side block your tv . this protect your expensive equipment . if you keep terk indoors without mounting it , you probably don't need ground it , so i don't blame audiovox not including them . reception wise , quick test , i disconnected my cheapo antenna terk soon it arrived tuned my worst station . i saw immediate 30% signal boost than before one station ! great . unfortunately , don't expect 30% boost * every * channel . more than likely , any station you could get before ( even really badly ) , you'll get good steady signal terk-sp . but any channel whose signal often drops 0% any reason , you're probably not going get terk because 0 times 30% still 0 . when i first installed terk-sp , i even ( intermittently ) picked up entirely new ( obscure out-of-town ) station i never got before , but some reason , i haven't able pick it up again weeks . mounting time took 45 minutes . screw mounting arm post or rooftop ( brackets/clamps mounting terk round post come it ) , antenna arm . then run your cable inside your tv . that it . short answer : this great antenna should work great long you already receive * steady * signal ( least minute or two ) your local stations . terk-sp flat-face design works best areas where it pick up " reflected " signals off neighboring buildings such . i suspect benefits terk-sp might lost if you live middle nowhere no place signals bounce off . also , hd signals very directional , so it helps not live location where you surrounded stations coming you different directions . you need point your antenna direction " generally " right direction all stations . it took two people properly adjust my terk best possible reception ( " little left . no , signal stronger back right . " ) . positioning options left/right , tilt twist ( low number stations taller signals like antenna whose face more * parallel * ground ) . terk-sp works great i highly recommend it , but i don't really know how it compares other antennas since i've never tried them , but i tell you i am now getting strong steady signals stations i received only intermittently before	-1

i older ipod photo got very banged up simple everyday use . scratches dings abound it . new 30gb video ipod i bought also black , which means fingerprints would problem , scratches more obvious . i bought isee so i wouldn't deal scratching -- if i scratches case , i'd buy new case 1/15 what ipod cost . however , i also didn't want my case try " dress up " my ipod . one reasons i like ipod because it ( imo ) best-looking media player marke t.t he isee good case these purposes , contrary earlier reviews , pops off easily , but requires very specific pressure . pulling top case around ' hold ' switch makes case pop off . case only goes one way , so you avoid what happened my griffin iclear , which i clumsily broke attaching back side upside down , effect , locking case such i physically fracture bottom case . won't happen ( thankfully ) isee . isee also clearer ( ironically ) than iclear back side ipod , which i like . unfortunately , though , you might disappointed if you apple universal dock , because you force ipod into dock -- it too wide fit comfortably isee it	-1

first , main con - headphones unfortunately lack good , heavy bass ! main pro - volume clarity nice enough you still enjoy your music block out external noises . they're lightweight ; headband sits comfortably my head speakers fit nicely over my ears without pinching ( even though i always wear hoop earrings - major plus ) . long cord allows plenty freedom volume clip pretty convenient . overall , these fun headphones great use work . style attracts little attention well . :	-1
print server very easy set up , using cd provided . no special training necessary . just follow simple instructions . we bought it because network card our 2 year old hp laser printer failed . replacement (...) , which ridiculous . this product same thing much less . response time when you click-to-print until printer actually responds slower , but only matter few seconds . our small office peer-to-peer network everything going through switch .	-1

if sound quality you're looking equated old mini-transitor radio , you might pleased . even so , you would probably expect pay around $15 product - not something $40 plus range ! like reviewer , i very low expectations such small speakers but apparently not low enough . speakers cannot handle bass all avoid complete sound distortion you need keep volume very low which essentially forces you literally within foot or two unit . furthermore , there no easy way retreive your ipod once inserted ! i feel i deceived 5 star reviews i used make my purchasing decision felt obligated respond . miniblaster good concept poorly executed i'm afraid i wasted my money .	-1
i owned this printer over six months yet any problems it . used daily basis , my printer still original set cartridges still produces quality prints even near end cartridges . photos , images , text always sharp , rich , far beyond quality my lexmark epson printers ' results . even though it advertised photo printer , it works well all types documents prints amazingly fast . printer able print memory cards , copy , scan media while your pc off . " color " " black " buttons producing copies help make copying very simple . these stand-alone features worked well me , but there one minor annoyance : you cannot scan memory card , only pc . other than this , my only other complaints mp500 must usb passthrough port work there slight red tint photos default . after using other entries competing photo all-in-one lines , i recommend mp500 highest am most satisfied this printer	-1

i've never liked universal remotes . it seems like they never power everything up or down properly system multiple components , or you lose functions original remotes . so when i got one my birthday i extremely skeptical . however , next day i programmed remote ( surprisingly quick process ! ) , it now everything my other remotes . it truly learns what you want it . you program individual buttons specific funstion very easily . i tv , vcr , dvd , stereo , tivo all running off this remote , now i want other system my house . i'd highly recommend this remote anyone who currently uses multiple remote controls !	1

this kvm switch very solidly constructed - metal case , high quality cables push button switch ( my opinion , push button switch better than soft switch ) . because its weight , it doesn't get dragged around cables . it works power drawn usb connections , but it also comes its own power , which nice . it also additional usb port which you use share usb device such webcam or usb microphone . what really nice i actually connect this usb port my dell monitor which built-in usb hub , so now i 4 extra usb ports . i " blue screen death " few days when switching computers after installing this kvm switch , but problem went away after i disconnected old webcam connected switch . if you're using windows , it takes few seconds mouse keyboard become active after switching . linux , it takes almost no time . if you find video quality low ( e.g. fuzziness ) , try adjust your monitor settings . when i first plugged it , resolution wasn't good , it looked fuzzy . but after " auto adjust " my monitor , it became very sharp . tech support connectpro seems responsive . i emailed them " blue screen death " problem couple times got replies promptly . their tech support also skype , although i never tried talk him . only real shortcoming this kvm switch it usb 1.0 instead usb 2.0 . windows xp complains this everytime you switch it . i give this switch 4-star because this . btw , anyone know why indicator button shows half-red half-green when it switched it ? it against common engineering practice	-1

though i rated it 1 star , i'd give it none if option . i really don't like write negative reviews , but i feel other parents need warned when product isn't worth price shipping , much less price itself . i thought this would make fun practice piano my three year old son . he began piano lessons recently needs practice fingering motions keyboard . i wanted something small few bells whistles thought this little keyboard would perfect practicing piano fingering . i put 6 fresh batteries it when it arrived ( it not come ac adaptor mentioned instruction manual ) turned it . 3 seconds , there fairly nice song . after it gets garbled makes horrid static sound . i poured over instructions figure out what i doing wrong . nowhere it mentioned it should making this ear-splitting garbled static no matter what button you press . worst part - it probably cost me more ship it back than i'll get refund . this utter piece junk waste plastic . never again i buy item hasn't reviewed amazon.com . save your money , willing spend bit more , find better keyboard . frankly , i can't believe amazon.com would sell this product or not least test it before selling it	-1

first glance , comprehensive feature set these phone impressive , including such perks wall mountable , room monitor mode if you more than one handset , different ringtones , 2.4 5.8 ghz . these same features turn out well-nigh inaccessable , or compromised point uselessness . only main unit wall mountable , satellites not . if your phone jack not near wall you want mount , you no options . this important if you use voip . don't expect mount kitchen handset wall . room monitor , or baby monitor , frankly idiotic . it suggested monitor sleeping baby . batteries grant perhaps half hour eavesdropping if you're lucky enough activate mode first place . you need negotiate menu after menu dig it up , after which one phone emits very loud tone . second phone then rings loudly well , when you confirm it you them beep same time . believe me , baby not sleeping any more . there many ringtones packaged phone , all uniformly universally irritating . best sounds tinny cheap , worst makes you scramble phone just end its metallic shriek . 2.4 ghz grants very little range ; i've lost contact thin intervening wall twenty feet space . my old cheaper panasonic allowed me stroll mailbox without static call . you cannot dial your voicemail speakerphone mode , phonebook speaker buttons tiny , talk button , which also hangs up call , huge placed dead center phone . cough you've hung up . callers need identify themselves now , you confident you no longer recognize their voices . i already mistaken friend voice his sister , embarassed them both mistake , embarassed myself i , normally careful shopper , purchased such techno dud . i warned against uniden products should heeded those warnings . when these phones expire , i go back panasonic . unfortunately , i must grant these phones extra star because they seem built well , although not very rugged . heavy uncomfortable hold , they probably withstand impact well enough i not able justify purchasing new phones anytime soon . update ; spoke too soon . first one broke this morning , fall wood floor . other one managed drop call five feet base . two cans string would better . i suspect rave reviews this phone received because other reviewers haven't tried better phones . this phone ultimately suffers lack ergonomics- uncomfortable , unintelligible , inaccessible . skip it something else	-1
some reviews here negative because mouse doesn't behave properly i.e. makes big jumps , etc . i think this bad rap . mouse optical needs right surface work properly . i tried mine variety surfaces , plain paper my laptop case . some surfaces slick , others textured . mouse worked flawlessy anything texture or design . it worked poorly plain paper or anything else it could not read well . i love my little guy use it quite happily laptop case if nothing else available	1

if you've ever used any sort cassette tape system , it likely you've seen maxell name . this device pretty much must-have connecting any audio signal into your tape player . concept very simple . you stick tape cassette into your tape deck , whether it your car , your rv , your house , your boat . other end cable simple , normal headphone plug . this means you use it your ipod or any other mp3 player . you use it cd players , radios , other devices too . there really no moving parts , no batteries wear down , nothing else . this makes it super easy use , great playing your mp3 music out any car you hop into . you don't wire things up , fiddle radio stations , or worry static . sound goes directly out your machine into stereo tape deck . voila ! i 2 or 3 these around house , maxell one works wonderfully . highly recommended - keep one car , one house , one you when you travel . you never know when they'll come handy	1

i bough this product after reading several reviews other people . pros : toshiba gigabeat really nice design perspective , look feel pleasant . software well designed pretty intutive . though it doesn't click wheel like ipod , but i didnt find any problem using it going through various menus . they all well designed visually much more better than i-pod or other similar players . it takes some time get use buttons other controls , but once you get accustomed then its zip . cons : i returned this player after one week , because biggest killer it battery life , it hardly lasts 6 hours . you cant expect mp3 player last just 6 hour . if i am outta my house , i should able play it least 12 hours ... thats only problem which i find this , which undid all its goodness . overall good player , if you live short battery life	-1

i've used hp a516 compact photo printer month now . i got it sale christmas $50 . what great deal ! few things note : 1 . best photo paper use this hp advanced photo paper . i bought some hp premium plus photo paper thinking since it more expensive , print quality ought better . however , this not so ! apparently , vivera ink specially formulated print hp advanced paper , which produces even-quality laydown ink , no defined edges different colors photo . hp premium plus photo paper showed defined edge blank ink , giving it " home-printed " look photo . hp advanced paper produced photo-lab quality prints looked awesome ! 2 . if you edit or crop any photos photoshop before you print it out , you should save file " baseline ( standard ) " format , otherwise printer not recognize " optimized " file type . 3 . buy ink cartridges paper directly hp site save money . they often great deals ink -- buy-one-get-one free or some other gimick . i managed buy paper ink price so it costs me $0.29 per print ( ink+paper costs ) . pros : - 4x6 photos truly borderless ! you can't tell prints come off inkje t-t ype printer . - photos printed off 1 photo per page , or more fun features -- 2 or 4 photos per page ! you choose same pictures all 4 wallet-sized photos , or choose 4 different photos print size . - you also print any frame mpeg ( video ) printer ease . just play video file stop it frame you want printed . it easy ! only thing resolution quality lower , but it looks pretty good video shot . ( this could improved other cameras , but this what i noticed my canon sd630)- instant photos ! this little printer prints rather quickly hp advanced quick-drying paper , photos ready handling jiffy ! - printer truly compact . it really cute , placed anywhere without taking up much space .	1

so many parents , i believe , don't care if toy educational . they just want quiet object their child focus so it doesn't interrupt mom or dad television show . this really more true instrument than toy . it educational . there manual comes it it teaches you how use it . you , smart parent , want read it first know how use it yourself so you spend several hours focusing your child learning how use it well . if you think music important you read manual . if you couldn't care less , then keep manual your child read his/her own so he/she get best use out instrument when they old enough read it their own . if you're annoyed noises music your kid blast pushing pulling instrument , then don't buy it . my personal feeling kids should given opportunities experience these kinds things , so if you want junior sit corner play quiet video game , don't bother buying this . this instrument also give your child exposure learn how play other instruments well . just like learning language , once you master one you much more easily learn others . same true musical instruments . learn this , your child learned how read music , playing ear , fingerings , chords , etc . so much better than something your child doesn't even use brain cell master	1
past i used backpack transport my laptop my work ( i teach college ) . perhaps it age , but backpack seemed very cumbersome heavy so i lookout nice rollerbag . this one really fit bill . like previous reviewer , i looked ton bags very petite ( 5'1 " ) size weight tremendous consideration . i leaning toward swiss gear patriot kensington bag even went so far purchase them online vendor local in-store pickup . i arrived store before order ready thought i'd look see what other bags store offer . that when i got look this bag ( saw it online , but couldn't find pictures inside bag so i hesitant ) . it exactly what i needed few nice surprises . first , other reviewers spot their reviews . this bag super lightweight , easy roll easy pick up ( either handle or shoulder strap ) when you need ( i pick it up when i climb stairs my classes ) . i love it more feminine looking bag . inside pockets main compartment ( though not rear compartment ) really pretty chocolate brown pinstripe liner ( okay , i like pretty things ) . zipper main compartment opens almost bottom sides bag , which makes accessing your things very simple . it padded compartment your computer rear bag elastic strap keep computer moving around too much . i easily access my 12 " powerbook , but it slightly tighter fit my 15.4 " macbook pro . also , top 2 inches mbp not protected padding so i use neoprene sleeve added protection . this makes bit more effortful remove laptop , but not annoyingly so . nice touch laptop compartment allows computer suspend slightly within bag so computer never touches bottom bag . main compartment also holds all my files class , well my textbook ( paperback ) small notebook . contrast backpack , i easily identify which files belong which class so i don't pull all my folders out everytime . there also room my power adapter my presentation remote case . rear compartment handy other computer accessories like cables , power adapter , umbrella . you see telescoping part handle this section it exposed . this didn't bother me first until i realized when i am rolling bag i actually see into this compartment when handle extended ( when stored there zipper covers handle ) . not much exposed , but if it raining i'll most likely carry bag or just make sure things compartment won't bothered little wetness ( don't let this distract you , bag it otherwise water resistant i don't see it huge problem ) . smaller zippered section lots little compartments pens , flash drive , ipod , other computer accessories . i also keep two glasses cases , my palm pilot wallet this section . i like this section opens up real wide some material sides so things don't fall out when you open it completely . smaller zippered compartment this outside this section great flat things like tissues , post-it notes , etc . top easy access zipper pocket super convenient too ! i keep my keys there ( though wish there key clip ) things like my phone , chapstick , lipstick small bottle lotion . it also great storing boarding pass bit cash when i travel . previously mentioned , this bag fits very easily under airline seats . strap back bag intended allow you place it over telescoping handle roller bag . strap not cover width bag might not fit over some handles . it works most standard ones , but hartmann bag i extra wide handle strap wasn't wide enough handle it . i use piggy-back system take these two trips together ( which makes easier rolling anyway ) . all all , this fabulous bag my needs . price here also excellent . i happy i paid $70 it listed amazon $92 though now it listed $57.89 ! you can't beat price ! i would not hesitate buy this bag again	1

after couple years heavy heavy use ( i travel quite bit through boats , planes , trains , automobiles ) , my old trusty e2cs conked out . they fantastic set headphones but i think i got right headset cord snagged one too many times passing objects . i went ahead upgraded e3gs ( i contemplate e4gs but couldn't justify myself extra $$$ yet ) . these purely replacement e2cs but i like design e3s e4s better ( i looked bit like alien pointy e2s i wonder whether they'd any sound difference . i didn't expect hear any sound difference e2cs e3gs but i . they just sounded richer , bit louder , fuller . soft plugs come them noticably more comfortable me . i always used silicone sleeves but now i'm using little gray ones it comes . overall , fantastic experience these . i mostly airplane travel these really isolate me noise gray foams aren't sensitive transmitting noise rustling cord like some older models . i own two bose headsets too ( older newer model ) . i like them but i always limited space when i travel overall , i think i get more isolation in-ear design shures but there advantages boses ( i prefer them intercontinental travel they're more comfortable over very long distances ) . they're very different headsets just fyi . i hesitated compare all but they headsets . i know these little in-ears either love em or hate them affair . sorry can't predict your particular experience hope i don't steer anyone wrong direction . they worked me i notice difference upgrade e2c e3gs . i wonder if there noticable difference e4gs ? maybe when these snag something one too many times , hopefully few years now .	1
i am sorry see negative reviews this board . i bose speakers more than thirty years . my first set , pair 601 still functioning friends house . my 901 series vi blow away any home theater systems i've heard . direct reflecting sound , there no need center channel , rear channel . you just get realism listening experience unmatched . i two sets acoustimas am-5 i am totally satisfied . i've one set since 1991 tribute quality longevity product . i purchased second set when i finished my basement they nothing short awesome . when i entertain , i almost always get compliment sound speakers . other reviewers commented lack bass . i would just say you really pay attention placement subwoofer . bose intends subwoofer use floor platform send bass throughout room . placing subwoofer nearer corner room sometimes increase bass . i both my systems set up subwoofer corner firing out 45 degree angle rooms totally filled deep rich bass . i always preached gospel putting your money good set speakers . while your other equipment important , speaker system make or break quality your sound . but any speaker system , you finesse placement optimal results .	1

i am par t-t ime musician am always looking something small portable record practices concerts . many years , i used wmd3 sony professional walkman but flipping tape every 45 minutes pain . advent digital technology , i got sharp mini-disc found it very useful . 80 minute discs great sound quality quite good . later , i got sony m1 professional dat . it very good , but i found built-in mic preamps disappointing , despite getting oade modification . recording time increased 2 hours . real drag now transferring recording real-time computer conversion . wav so i could make cds . i recently got r09 . it small very light , much lighter than my dat . it uses sd cards . 2gb sd card , costing $25 , record 3 hours music 44.1 khz ! it also record straight mp3 if you smaller card or need conserve space . best all , there no real-time transfer hassles . just plug card reader drag drop file computer . awesome ! nice thing r09 there variety input options . there mic input line input , there lot headroom input , making it difficult overdrive it . there low cut filter filter out rumble . mic input uses 1/8 " mini jacks supply plug-in power mics just like sony wmd3 pcm m1 . r09 also features built-in mics whose sensitivity adjusted ( high or low ) . during recent practice , i used built-in mics pleasently surprised superb quality recording . r09 gives me option use built-in mics if i don't want take my external mics . some people complained r09 take only up 2gb sd cards . this not true any more . roland recently released firmware 1.10 which allows r09 use new sdhc ( high capacity ) cards . there very reasonable priced 4gb ($50 ) 8gb ($100 ) cards available . r09 very easy use well . interface so intuitive i made my first recording played it back without ever look manual . display bit small , espcially this day age , but perhaps roland it conserve power . because line-in , it very easy now me now convert cassettes , minidiscs , or dats . wav without tie up my computer hours end . ability convert audio . wav without computer very handy . summary , r09 marks major paradigm shift portable recording devices . it now so easy tape lectures , concerts , practices , just anything almost immediately it available burning cd playback . roland r1 m-audio microtrack paved way , but this unit packs needed features ease use right price point . highly reccomended . if you shop around , you get r09 authorized dealer less than $350 , bargain price when you consider what it allows you	1

just got my super fi 5 pro i like them . i owned shure e3c etymotic er4-p . my girlfriend needed new phones , so i gave my shure e3cs bought etymotic . i recently left them inside rental car ( big bummer ) so i needed new pair decided see what else out there . etys amzing clairty high end nice mids . they fit beautifully very easy put triple flanged sleeves . only complaint i bass , while you could " experience " it aurally , you never really " felt " it . i like my bass . so what i read online , super fi would good alternative bit cheaper than replacing etys . after listening jazz , classical , some snoop , stone temple pilots , bass indeed impressive . mids nice , using ipod , you customize sound using ipod eq . i am not impressed highs ( not nearly defined crisp etys ) but highs still there . i am willing compromise bit high end get more bass . fit relatively straightforward stock medium rubber sleeves work fine , though double flange sleeves work , too . i like how easy etys put ( ues require you bit more adjusting you put them wrap wire around top your ear like most musicians ) but i'm sure it become second nature . overall , someone who owned high end earphones got degree music , i think super fi good value . get same bass even better treble , i think you'd need spend twice much playing compressed music ipod , i just don't think it worth it . these phones nice compromise	-1
digimemo 692 digital notepad made sense me several reasons ; 1 ) it cheap - $90 + or - small risk take new technology ; 2 ) if you use it technology fails , you left ultimate safe , low tech backup - ink notes paper 3 ) it lighter easier use when move ( walking through building taking notes , or sitting meeting where laptop would awkward instance ) . main question me how well handwriting recognition could made work . so far i am cautiously pleased . dm works advertised . unit light , pen comfortable hand , writing faithfully recorded .. image computer screen faithful representation page ( occasionally small strokes missed ) , software interface dumping pages pc acceptable - it could smoother but works without any glitches or major hassles . actually , i rarely used it , since most my uploading directly hwr recognition program ( more below ) . it surprisingly good recognizing tables tables/spreadsheets . me , this unit would largely useless without hwr . i found myscript surprisingly good job reading my scrawl ( it scrawl - my handwriting terrible , i often print more than write , but found it reads script well printing ) . if you write neatly whole process much easier . myscript particularly useful if you 1 ) use built training program ( helped some ) 2 ) create lists words ( " personal lexicon " ) shorthand conversions ( " auto replacements " ) . former good aid recognition specialized technical terms , names , etc . latter most useful feature , though . it you create entire shorthand ("" becomes " " " sy " becomes " sincerely yours " etc . ) . best all , i discovered undocumented feature . instead entering shorthands or lexicon words one time you simply open . txt file ( " autoreplacements . txt " " lexicon . txt " myscript folder ) enter these wholesale . i now hundreds . handwritten " wed td " top page comes out " wednesday list . " my old newton learned corrections , so it became increasingly accurate . myscript doesn't ( i asked - nice people who answer my emails told me it trickier implement than i suspect ) . people learn though , so what happens me - i'm sure most people - my own style adapts what system shown it recognize . people good continual improvement machines . this not ultimate system . paper size too small some uses ( unlike some reviewers , though , i found 6x9 pads easy find drug or office supply stores ) . it would nice if system video out and/or drawing table functionality . more expensive cyberpad takes 8.5 " 11 " paper serves tablet , i am told , acecad folks indicated next version digimemo ( " out soon " ) also . batteries really last long time ( 100 hours advertised seems right ) . it would nice if lcd screen clipboard more than show if page written or blank , but thast feels like niggling . this very good device but not all people or purposes . this not you if you need hwr but aren't willing spend time making it work . but ... if you hate taking out laptop meetings or classrooms , if you disorganized like your written notes together one place , if you need draw something shoot it off email ( ability connect mobile web this would killer app dm ) , if you need take notes while standing or walking don't want re-type them all , then this may great device you	-1

i really like this bag - i bought it use college , which i just recently started . it holds just everything i could possibly need , my laptop , my graphics tablet , my books , et cetera . this bag not without its flaws , however . previously stated many other reviews , there no place hold water bottle . flaw its design fact there so many small pockets ! these pockets can't hold more than few things , so you spread your small items throughout them , then when you need something forced hunt through half dozen tiny pockets filled small objects look your flash drive , or your keys , or tampon or whatever else you put there . one last flaw : because it so big , many students sympathise way too many books , bag easily get really heavy . one occasion , i dropped something so i leaned down pick it up , only unable get back up because my bag so heavy ! this probably not problem everyone better shape than i am , but extremely heavy bags tend bit inconvenience most people . overall , this bag really great . i like it , good outweighs minor inconveniences	-1

it worked right get go far recording my vhs tape , very easy figure out . i no problems formatting my dvd ( i used windata dvd-r ) or recording . what i problem final result drops frames , resulting jerky stop-motion look . also , there no way tell how much time you left record until it just suddenly stops recording . seems me dvd should hold least two hours , but it only held hour half . i really excited first when it seemed like it would work perfectly , then so disappointed poor results inadequate information needed stress-free recording	-1

i ordered this device based upon good reviews first model . installation went fine device works almost expected . problem slingmedia , without notifying customers or potential costomers downgraded functionality . new devices ( old models which incorporate new firmware ) now utilize encrypted stream . this breaks programs such " large recorder " which let me record my tv material my review time my choice . since i travel abroad lot , i great need able place time shift . sitting hotel tokyo 6:00 p.m. , i'm not much interested watching what us 3:00 a.m. ! i'd advise looking other solutions . i think it very irresponsible slingmedia introduced this dramatic reduction function without telling customers they would getting less than past	-1

despite sold x-fi card , this particular model not use x-fi chipset . fact it uses variation audigy 2 se chipset . this further confirmed fact this card uses different drivers than rest x-fi line , not recognized x-fi card games . main problem this you cannot uses any x-fi features games like you would expect . try using this card battlefield 2142 you see what i mean . creative labs should ashamed themselves this blatant act marketing fraud . when someone buys ferrari , they expecting get ferrari , not honda ferrari emblem front . but exactly what creative labs here . they marketing this sound card high-end brand ( x-fi ) when it really crippled version previous product line ( se model audigy ) . they must glut unsold chips they thought they could pull fast one consumers this cheap card . i one very cautious before i consider purchasing creative labs products future . buyer beware	-1

musician general audiophile , i large collection , obsession headphones all shapes sizes . these jvc obviously not going sound like $300.00 studio monitors , but they their job very well . dynamics great , smooth curve , ample attention midrange . they're less bassy than their sony counterparts , which actually advantageous , sonys way too bassy . you'll make sure you use right size silicone ear-piece ( 3 sizes included ) volume slider cord great , however cord wicked long ! these perfect replacement crap headphones came your ipod . buy them if you looking earbuds under $30.00	1
i owned previous version this monitor , 213t , 6 months completely happy it . only problem refresh rate bit slow ( i think around 16ms ) . but it wasn't so much problem since i didn't watch much video or play games it . otherwise color viewing angles fine . my other computer monitor i viewsonic 20 inch lcd , which i purchased because i needed fast refresh so i play games . i never liked this monitor though , it always problems recognizing it connection my pc color viewing angles not very good either . plus it weird viewing quality it , like i looking through screen door or something . so when i saw samsung updated 213t into 214t fast refresh something like 6ms , i decided replace viewsonic . i'm so happy i ! 214t bigger far superior monitor than viewsonic , definite improvement even 213t . great color quality , no ghosting while playing games or watching video , really wide viewing angle .	1

i currently use microsoft intellimouse i purchased 4-5 years ago . it most comfortable mouse medium large sized hands . bar none . microsoft kept it sweet simple they winner ! why they ever took this mouse off market , i'll never understand . after getting new pc recently , i decided " splurge " get one these ultra-ergonomic mice . i looked usual suspects : logitech , kensington , microsoft , etc . i disappointed feel fit various mice i tried weren't smooth intellimouse . then , lo behold , i noticed microsoft rereleased intellimouse . great , my search over ! i received mouse today . same design , same fit . awesome . only one problem you manufacturing geniuses ,... scroll wheel rattles unbelievably !!! how bad ? think those old-fashioned new year eve noisemakers you hold small handle twirl around circle . that sound it makes , i'm not kidding . original intellimouse scroll wheel very quiet when use . how could you screw this one up ?! it same product you offered few years ago color black now ! you somehow lose drawings original intellimouse scroll wheel ? you need save extra 50 cents it manufactured somewhere else ? what dealbreaker . i'm sticking my old intellimouse until microsoft gets clue fixes this oversight	-1

i am giving this unit lowest possible score reasons below . fact this product lexar actually named " secure " invokes belief it really secure . however , i discussing this lexar over two weeks now , without resolution . problem encrypted vault ( reason i purchased thing ) not available except when signed administrator . hello ??!! why would lexar build unit smaller than some earrings my girlfriend wears if they not expect it used portable device , meaning it would used many different computers ? so , if you go library , or work network , or your friend billy house , you not administrator , you lose ! only way around this put your most sensitive material right public drive , not use secure features drive . make sense ? i sent software version lexar no improvement , tried all their suggestions , now unit display microsoft windows error screen shut drive down . fair , if you not need access sensitive material any computer ( without admin rights ) then this unit could work you . it works great my home computer , but i just admit portable device i tend want port it around use it other machines cannot . if you need access your data many machines , wish so without admin rights , beware ! i suggest you look lexar website contact them make sure this possible . i'm still wrestling them , am hopeful i take them mat pin them , able actually use this storage device advertised .	-1

i also bought this system primarily bose name quality , it sound much better deeper store , it easy hook up first impressed ease use sound , but then i started experiencing problems unit freezing during movies . only way get it play again unplug unit wall " reboot " then spend 10 minutes trying get back place you left off . after reading some other reviews 321 system , i see this common problem . it freeze some movies not all others , it makes no sense whatsoever . i also own movies my dvd collection it refuses play all , but play fine my 8 year old pioneer dvd system . i am not satisfied this system all consider it way over priced performance craftsmanship . i replace this unit next year , but it not bose . stick speakers bose , not electronics . lesson learned	-1

i bought this simple mount put magnavox 37mf 321 , 37-inch lcd tv wall , or more accurately , my new " entertainment center " i built into standard 4-inch sheet-rocked wall . my new entertainment center only requires two inches living room space , replacing crt tv entertainment center required over 26 inches valuable living room real estate ! this made big difference our 16x18 living room . while there few design features could probably improved , overall it proved up task . it mounts tv nice flat , there seems plenty lateral adjustment get screen level straight . i shorten few bolts hacksaw ; if making few minor alterations such this beyond your capabilities , you probably shouldn't doing this job yourself anyway . if possible get friend help hold tv , especially when making your cable connections tv just before hanging it . i actually managed this myself , but helper would very useful . if you looking fancy , tilt swivel mount lots features(which also stick out further wall ) , look elsewhere . if you just need simple mount hang your tv flat wall , this just thing . overall , inexpensive mount job	1
if it would only cost same sd micro card comparably size capacity , it would almost perfect , i say " almost " because i encountered minor flaw i don't really know if it phone or memory . some times , after viewed many times image it kinds corrupts file but not point image not viewable , but rather it mess up some pixels it or sometimes half image . i've seen this other memories digital cameras , but i can't sure who blame . it include memory stick pro duo adapter , but if you need use it ms reader ( larger original sony memory ) , you still need buy adapter convert ms duo plain ms but many new multi card readers ability use newer smaller ms duo pro , so included adapter enough	-1

this remote unreliable junk ... well ... let me rephrase ... remote itself fine but software controls it absolute garbage which causes remote completely freeze up least once day . if you kind person turns computer hour ... uses remote , shuts off you'll probably never problem . but users pvr software keep their machines up running 24x7 . i this piece work freezing up me least once day . after researching further , i found program computer controls remote goes into infinite loop state where it uses 100% processor . only way re-initialize remote restarting computer but if your computer currently recording something you'll end up corrupting show you recording . after research i found many others web same issue . i'm sure someone read this say " load new drivers idiot ! " ... believe me , i'm up-to-date most current drivers date this review ( feb/2007 ) . streamzap acknowledged problem prior versions driver but it still exists this day . just search internet see . [ ... ] you take my word it , or you take your chances . if streamzap replied even one multiple emails i sent asking help i would happy work them . but i think they know problem out there they don't want address problem . they see numerous postings all over internet other people like me same issue	-1
i waited while before submitting review give this unit good try . i already portable unit ( garmin ) but wanted in-dash unit my other car . time this unit twice much garmin but it also played dvds . i very disappointed once i got this unit which cost twice much portable more than most other units market . biggest disappointment he not guide you fraction well any portable units market . garmin take you right door address you put . this unit ( if it find address ) gets you there says " you arrived .. " . but where , which side street , which building etc . my garmin take me right my own front door this expensive unit gets me area then i am left figure out which building ( all unique addresses ) i am looking . detachable controls unit would make you feel you paid $200 unit . it feels like it mostly plastic it couldn't cost them very much make . radio unit i car prior great detachable unit its own carrying case - you get no such thing pioneer . i thought bit cheap pioneer not even include carrying case such expensive unit . interface unit awkward time consuming . when you put address it apparently searches both state washington ( where i live ) oregon . i called pioneer ask if i could just search washington since i didn't care addresses other states this time when i i could just put state . way , this regular feature portable units . pioneer tap dances around answer but bottom line - no . what you expect only unit market where you put over side road apply parking brakes multiple times before switching addresses . i would get into problems pioneer getting its map upgrades out . again , something i spoke them you should hear song dance they give . however , if only thing wrong paying twice much unit delivers half much portable units i would just complain pionner . save money . if you want good reliable gps unit look either portable units or one other brands in-dash ones . built-in dvd players you get one those put your car fraction price . remember you always take back one portable units but pioneer you put out extra $200 get it installed well so no real taking it back . i urge you shop carefully if you all looking purchasing this unit . positive note , it fun watch screen come out pop up you first turn it . but i am not sure price worth	-1

new ipod video u2 special edition simply brilliant . reason ? well , there more then just one solitary reason : first course , amazing ipod itself . 30 gb storage ( thats 10 more gigs then original ipod u2 se ) , you plenty room upload pictures , videos , music . video quality ipod crystal clear , everything you need make pleasureable viewing experience . however , if you given ipod minimal charge , expect battery life drop significantly while watching videos , movie viewing eats up battery life . course , itunes makes uploading multiple songs videos breeze ; perfect your average joe techie . screen itself given upgrade , larger cleaner screen . screen noticably bigger , creates better viewing current movie played . video ipod also slimmer then older versions ( 1g , 2g , 3g , course 4g ) although paper marginal difference(compared 4g ) , your hand you feel it thinner robust body . headphone jack switched different position , posing troubles your pre-5g accessories . if you accessories you really need , i recommend keeping your older ipod , or consult someone see if location work out . outside box appearance also greatly slimmed down all videos , making it easy take around or great show off tight corners . lackluster accessories included ipod(a dock connecter , usb cable , headphones ) pose disappointment , majority users want wall charger , which included prior versions ipod . however , you may purchase one apple $29.00 . specs nice , but what really makes this one really special ... appearanceapple finally released u2 version ipod video , which , my opinion , beautiful move . u2 se stands out beautifully other 5g ipods ( black white ) , prominent red click wheel dabbed right center . yes , click wheel smallest version yet , regardless it same slick red finish . front finish ipod beautiful more glossy black used gather much more gleam then its older 4g model . front side also less likely gather scratches compared 4th . however , black finish means scratches inevitable , so i highly recommend use some type protection . finally , unlike its predecessor , 5g u2 se giving ultra-nice touch ; black chrome finish backside . this one simple touch utterly amazing , each band members signature shown crisply . compared chrome finish 4g u2 , signatures easily seen perfectly distinguishable . black rear finish also gives more protection minor scratches , which would , overtime , destroy appearance older ipod itself . however black finish hide most small scratches , yet , once again , case needed . closing : finishing note , this best looking ipod ever assembled . small touches make this more distinguishable garner more head turns . ipod also recieve less scratches , which great thing , my old 4g u2 got mutilated matter days . this must buy , regardless if you want stick out , or if you huge u2 fan . package comes certificate free 30 minute documentary u2 , which good deal , we get least one thing free(the older u2 se only came packaged certificate giving us 50 dollars off itunes definitive collection , priced around 250 . ) all all , great buy , if you think it , its not pricey ; only 20 dollars more overall better looking ipod sticks out , more value . also two more tid-bits : charge ipod ; oh yea , when you dont need it , turn off your backlight , it saves lot battery life , majority battery sucking comes light itself . pros : -amazing playback , crystal clear sound-beautiful display , vibrant color both movies photos . -excellent finish , black chrome rear , more glossy black front . -the great click wheel , which still maintains perfect control(regardless toned down size ) . -great movie playback-perfect interface itunes , giving addition music video playing breeze . cons : -more easily scratched compared white ipod . -battery life tends mind its own , going quick die-out , long lasting . -again , battery life seems too dull , die out quickly if not given full charge . -video playback desperately cut into battery life . -for first timers , there no manual included , so optional use tex t-t ype maybe required . -no wall charger/lackluster accessories	1
there awful lot reviews out web kvm switches . usually , more information good , right ? this case , i found so many contrasting opinions any given switch or company i banging my head against desk just trying decide what buy . usually , head-banging doesn't start until equipment received setup begins . this case , i found most head-banging evidently paid up front . i got box , hooked it up two computers ( third way , if changes anything , i'll try repost ) , turned computers . nobody happy anything . first computer didn't seem like display second didn't seem like keyboard or mouse . ( obviously , i couldn't tell whether first liked keyboard or mouse . ) three keyboard lights stuck num , caps , scroll lock , no matter which system kvm focus . note both systems verified working alone monitor , keyboard , mouse , prior my receiving kvm switch . i tried disconnecting mouse keyboard individually switch plugging them back . no effect . i power cycled " visible " computer , no effect . i powered both down , powered both back up , now everything seems fine . don't ask me -- i'm trying not believe gremlins or voodoo . possibly ( ir)relevant detail : when things started working , i realized i powered up first , let it complete boot cycle , then powered up second . it may kvm switch unable convince two machines simultaneously booting everything connected , although this pure speculation my part . i'll probably stick this sequence future ( no , voodoo , no ! ) because i like watch boot sequences . yeah , i'm nerd . system specifics :o system 1 : ( originally non-displaying system ) gateway g6-350 , running windows 98o system 2 : dell precision 330 , running windows 2000 proo monitor : gateway ev700 . curiously , this monitor shipped system 1 , which made initial display problem even more puzzling . o keyboard : standard ps/2 keyboard shipped gatewayo mouse : microsoft wheelmouse optical ( 2-button ) . this usb mouse came adaptor insertion into ps/2 port . i bought it last week because dell didn't recognize wheel behavior original gateway mouse . software came mouse installed gateway , but not dell , oversight . no biggie -- everything i need mouse , it . minor feature complaints :o noted here other sites , layout switch , outputs two long sides , makes bit octopus . if you want access switch , change systems without using hot keys , this might annoy you . o there only one button switch , so you cycle among all ports every time you want change active systems . not only this even more annoying when i hook up my third system , it just plain annoying switch isn't smart enough only switch connected ports . however , hot key functionality makes up this some degree . o ports " numbered " internally such 1 3 one side , 2 4 other . this seems bit bone-headed . o ports not visibly numbered box ( least i noticed , if they labeled , then labels should more obvious)conclusion : i bought this switch because it seemed good combination price features . amazon markdown almost scarily good ; i hoped it meant iogear come out something new , everybody just wanted clear inventory . my research indicated iogear , d-link , linksys usually rated mostly okay users , belkin somewhat below , other , cheaper models not often discussed . aten avocent lines seemed positively reviewed , especially online magazines like , but you're talking big price bump ( they usually eight-port switches ) . i would liked better switching , better cable routing , on-screen display , but these weren't deal breakers -- i knew what i trading off save money . hot key sequence change systems not annoying me -- regular emacs user , i'm used " chording " -- but it may , others . so . . . so far , so good . knocking wood , not because i believe voodoo or gremlins , but because i'm irish , that what we	-1

friend mine i bought printer each same day local aafes powerzone here germany ... he bought kodak printer dock series 3 ( not " plus " one ) i bought selphy cp710 . when we went home , he took pic his kodak camera ( which why he bought kodak dock ) . we printed pic both printers ( i used sd slot selphy print ) , they came out very crisp clear . i personally wouldn't able tell difference these prints something developer . now printers , they both printed image very sharp . almost can't tell difference them except blacks kodak darker , but it not like it horrible selphy . lcd only really useful selphy see images stored card , which you can't kodak ( since it doesn't screen ) ... it too small see any detail since image printed only takes up 2/3 already limited space . anyway , i am very impressed pictures these turn out , plus if you look around , you get cost per picture down 20 cents if you buy 108 sheet/ribbon set . definitely must buy my book	1

when i first discovered this portable dvd player , i impressed how much it met both my normal oddball demands . however , after some time , i gradually became less satisfied it than i first month i it . first foremost , its internal speaker volume somewhat weak , even when volume control set maximum possible level , i prefer not deal hastle headphone wire . my second gripe this model it not play mp3s recorded dvd . dvd5 single-layer discs hold six times standard cd , it unfortunate this model cannot play hours mp3 files recorded 320 kbps constant bit rate , highest quality mp3 file format date . ( please click ' comments ' let us know if incorrect . ) none philips portable dvd players currently play dts audio tracks . if i am road , yet want higher sound quality than dvd standard dolby digital audio track , this feature i miss , but only slightly because only four my most frequently played dvds use dts audio track . i decided send this unit out philips because its finish breaking off speakers arrow keys . this unit made multi-region compatible . disk door open , power up set while holding down osd . when menu appears , change region ' 0 . ' power off set close disc door . its pal-to-ntsc conversion leaves little bit desired if connected tv set . i recently upgraded philips pet724 7 " model . it larger , yet mannageable . it only runs approximately $20 more , but most all , it much better performer than this model . however , if you absolutely cannot dig up extra cash and/or make extra room your briefcase , it not like you purchased total lemon portable dvd player because two good things this model going it ultracompactness stable disc mechanism , so least you this product years come	-1

really , it hard go wrong when purchasing lcd tv . just look something hd , least 800:1 contrast ratio 8 msec refresh rate cheap possible . this very good tv , very good picture , very low price . only major downside this tv only 720p or 1080i , instead 1080p . 720p 1080i fine most applications , including hdtv . but if you want look future , you might want 1080p tv . newer hd dvd systems ( blue ray hddvd ) play station 3 require 1080p best picture . personally , i don't think hd dvd really take off ( but i could wrong ) i am not going get play station 3 , but i would still get 1080p tv , just case . however , i don't think you find 1080p lcd tv anywhere close this price range . other minor downside this tv it little confusing setup . it comes sheet quick setup instructions , but there no paper owners manual . owners manual cd , or you go online view i t.t he default mode this tv normal antenna connection you would use cable tv disabled . so , you go through menus tv figure out how enable antenna hookup . after , you instruct tv channel search , both analog digital . tv comes astc tuner , so you get hd channels off air ( free ) . however , getting hd channels off air difficult . if you get poor reception your area , then you won't able get hd channels . locking hd channels more difficult than old analog channels . if you don't rooftop antenna you house , then you need get rabbit ears . then it like back 1960 screwing around antenna placement get signal . i get best signal old rabbit ears my kids broke off , touching them wrought iron stand . i thinking bringing out aluminum foil . tv also qom tuner , so you get hd channels directly off cable , without getting special cable box . most cable systems , you pick up all local hd stations they offer basic cable ( bay area , it only 5 12 local stations ) . you pick up espn hd if you expanded basic service . only thing you can't get premium channels like hbo . hbo hd you still need cablebox . most lcd tv you get right now , default setup picture quality not optimally set up . this especially true standard analog tv . when you first hook up lcd tv , picture look pretty bad . you need go adjust color , contrast other settings get best picture quality . although defaults olevia better than some others i seen . although syntax olevia relatively new names they recognized one leaders lcd tv . it hard go wrong this tv . end , i recommend choosing size tv you need , deciding if you really need 1080p , then buying cheapest tv you find .	-1

i little skeptical when buying this mouse .. i wasnt sure whether or not i would like colors , or just really annoyed , but i say , its pretty cool little mouse . colors very vibrant ( i'm going post some pictures ) but not too bright where it distract user . it retractable mouse , cord quite short , so desktop useage limited many people , but its perefect laptop if you want something big enough actually able use , but small enough store easily carrying case . mouse moves pretty fast across screen without great deal movement . some people like this , some dont . personally , i like it better than my desktop mouse , which needs great deal movement get it across screen . its good laptop users limited area move mouse . overall , i would say this great mouse buy , especially kid , but adults enjoy it too	-1
i've using this radio few days now really like it . it above average . forget guy says it cheap knobs , plastic case , etc . it really feel sturdy , good selectivity pulls distant stations well . only drawback i wish this radio would some sort memory selected stations . but i easily find my favorites manually . it lot fun quality evident . i would definitely recommend it based price/quality . plus lacking most radios this type big speaker . most short wave radios tiny speaker which really bad . i don't know why they this ??? i would gladly pay more money bigger speaker some sound it .	-1

this one most expensive electronic purchases i ever made but it worth it !!! i don't know why so many people problems . i receive software update last summer repaired weird glitch remote controlling my tivo/directv receiver , but that it . bose very helpful over phone . this system beats any 5-6 speaker system i ever owned but i don't recommend it large room because you depend speakers bouncing off walls since there no rears . i don't know why so many people say it won't play their discs . mine plays everyting dvds cdrs even bootleg dvds !!! maybe they should call bose get free software upgrade . here bit advice before purchasing anything this expensive : go bose outlet store , best buy or sears listen it before you buy it ! i bought mine november 2004 1700.00 best buy when it still new , now it dropped almost half price almost 2 years . shame you bose	1

there still lot love s350 , big full sound , incredible fm reception , generally strong am reception , good rugged looks . but drift minor annoyance . worse , two am stations here los angeles , 1150 980 ( dodgers baseball ) , get overcrowding , meaning two stations playing once , no matter how narrow filter i get this overcrowding . my 40-dollar ge superradio iii doesn't this problem . but ge doesn't digital readout i hate finding sweet spot . so there big digital radio doesn't these flaws ? i hear there . soon there radio available called redsun 3000 , designed same maker grundig s350 ( called tecsun bcl 2000 china ) , which supposed blow away all competition . already redsun 2100 said superior 350 but ergonomic problems . 9-22-06 , redsun 3000 supposed only few months away . until redsun 3000 arrives , you may want look $99 sonido ( made sangean ) . it boasts presets , digital tuning , adds its fm/am tv band , but no shortwave . final point : if you're buying radio your office you use computer , i suggest you get good table radio remote control , like sangean wr-2 or its big brother sangean hdr-1 , high-definition radio . i point this out because any radio i've used within five feet my computer suffers horrible interference . place wr-2 ($159 ) or hdr-1 ($199 after rebate ) shelf or cabinet six feet away or so use your remote toggle preset stations . my experience these remote-control-operated radios well suited computer environments . update 12-31-06 : i've able get rid overcrowding am station 980 turning down am/sw rf gain knob . so i give fifth star s350	-1

i purchased this 3 months ago i absolutely love it . i bought it use my darkroom which small space it perfect . i am really big stereo systems . i don't think it worth listening music if it doesn't sound good . when i thinking getting speaker system i lot research , when i decided go this one i wasn't expecting too much . but i blown away sound , it definitly goes lot louder than i expected . now granted it isn't best but size price i can't complain . there however two things i would change it . base sound , it just doesn't sound way i like but you can't expect too much portable speaker system , i think it would better if they put seaking buttons machine , its fine if you remote you but if its not around then you navigate ipod itself which gets little annoying	1

after bought sony kdl46xbr2 set our primary tv , we wanted smaller high quality set bedroom . however , my wife unhappy mute function sony . this toshiba ( or without dvd player ) seems only one market mute feature my wife wanted . specifically , when mute button pressed , closed captioning ( visual writing spoken word appears ) although it takes two ( 2 ) presses because first press only partial mute lowering volume . when muted , press mute button clears writing audio resumes . sony -- apparently virtually all other current hd lcd tvs market -- require one go through menu turn closed captioning then turn it off , unless one wants both sound closed captioning when mute returned audible . feature my wife likes ability surf return original channel . one " lock " channel viewed , then surf multiple channels return original one click . only real fault i find instruction manual . it not sequentially go through each menu item , but skips back forth . i also think sound level lower than sony , but this most likely relative i set it higher numerical level , but percentage sound level bar , two appear same . other reasons difference may relate room acoustics , location , etc . i " issues " both sets although they imply set chooses correct image format - labeled " normal " , theater 1 " , " theater 2 " , " theater 3 " " full " this set " normal " , zoom " , " full zoom " " wide zoom " sony - neither one seems work . making changes sony easier there one button so directly ; toshiba , one must access menu	-1

i like receiver just fine , except fact i can't find universal remote code it my remote recognize . ( why can't they just publish code manual , right ?! ) unit really nice looking i love fact you dim very loud blue lighting front . however , you can't dim blue light power switch , which kind silly since other lights front panel dim very nicely . frankly , i don't like staring bright blue light while i'm trying watch tv . but i wanted write this review mainly thank amazon jr electronics amazing delivery service . amazon offered free shipping if i selected standard shipping speed which fine , so i expecting product arrive six days . but , i received email jr 2:45 am after day i ordered , saying box shipped , it arrived 10am day !!! they shipped it * overnight * me ups no charge . this really good service . thanks	-1
i can't tell you what you might want buy , but it shouldn't this unit . i've unable depend it since day i got it . i'm quite technical , managed tech support geeks several years , but this contraption tried my patience . it worked sporadically few weeks , sometimes good signal strength , but mostly weak one . well , okay , pc used wireless building our house , so i willing give it benefit my doubt . then i brought pc into same room wap tried tweak fiddle settings both wap pc , hoping zip up speed make connection more reliable . i couldn't even get connected point . updated firmware latest . reset everything factory defaults , then painstakingly entered wpa2 key ssid , plus admin password , all other things like allowed mac addresses , etc . okay , so now i see network my pc but i can't connect . then after few more connection tries , i couldn't even see network , nothing , nada , no dice . so i've gone downhill , sporadic usually slow connection building ... not even seeing wireless network while i'm literally sitting next wap . that it , i give up . i've wasted least 50 hours this device , it definitely not worth money . i bought this because i already own industrial-strength firewall/router didn't need router . maybe that where i went wrong , don't you same thing ! stay away this money time waster	-1

i bought one these units march 2006 response my wife constantly changing room arrangements , subsequently requiring tv work area didn't easy cable access . i looked several units other manufacturers , actually bought one try best buy , which leapfrog , i think . testing unit convinced me concept sound , i would kept unit except it operated 2.4 ghz , which caused interference every time microwave use , or telephone rang . my computer hard wired into network i don't want deal increased security requirements wireless , my phones work fine 2.4 ghz , so i looking solution , but 5.8 ghz . i called rf-link tech support , got all my questions answered placed order through amazon . product worked flawlessly six months then crapped out . crapping out , i mean when unit enclosed space where there exessive heat buildup , unit would stop working after 10 minutes . i contacted rf-link tech support , they promptly sent out replacement unit , explaining motherboard completely redesigned , therefore they sent me new units well new power supplies . replacement units worked flawlessly . although i upset go through return/rma process delay using product until thr replacement received , everything fine now . i would recommend this product anyone who doesn't want expense paying install cable outlets everywhere . those who concerned 5.8 ghz interference , phones , 6.0 ghz phones already available , so no future compatability issues there either	-1

i less impressed new case number reasons : 1 ) additional insulation cause heat related performance issues . 2 ) i trim bottom case sharp knife so it didn't catch when opening closing . 3 ) even after trimming case , recommended speck website , bottom part case still doesn't secure completely laptop ( although this could specific my machine ) . 4 ) additional weight back screen causes laptop shut considerable more force . 5 ) case adds overall weight size . 6 ) case further limits angle which laptop opened . still , i use top part case without bottom part . case provides some protection against flexible nature screen part laptop . if you allow top flex you run risk external pressure push rivets ( ones attach apple icon ) into back your display . this cause little dark spots your screen don't go away	-1

i love these headphones . i use them night bed when my girlfriend sleeping she doesn't hear thing . sound surprisingly great headphones very comfortable . line sight flexible - so you off side still reception . headphones don't look or feel cheap , not too heavy transmitter base looks really sleek . batteries last long time before recharging all you turn them put them they turn off soon you take them off - very cool feature . price great too considering quality features - shop around you'll find better prices . extra features these headphones i use occasion because they work best specific content : srs surround sound works great digital music movies feature surround sound . vibration " rumble " function works great dance hip-hop music , movies lots sound effects explosions ( like stars wars ) video games . one note : sound good source . reduce background hiss - turn up source audio not headphones volume . meaning , if its connected your stereo or tv - it work sort amp , so turn up volume there first before raising volume too high headphones . i no problems background hiss . pros : - sound great ( clear , loud , good bass treble)- comfortable- infrared = no tuning or inteference ( within line sight)- srs surround sound bass vibration function ( nice extras)- easy on/offcons : - infrared short range- line sight ( lose signal quality if base view obstructed)- kinda bulky looking ( looks aren't everyone)overall : price , features , quality sound looks there no better choice if you're looking short-range wireless headphones	1

i researched many dlp projectors , before buying this one . i believe i got best bang buck . it very versatile product . i am using it both home theater portable projector videos slideshows . positives : 1 ) price , good price 1024 768 native resolution . 2 ) 2500:1 contrast ratio , one highest this price range . 3 ) 2000:1 lumens , i play it bare , flat white wall , it looks clear crisp any movie theater , can't wait get my " screen goo " paint , my wall . 4 ) operation noise , fairly quiet normal mode , economy mode it ultra quiet , can't hear projector all . 5 ) keystone works great . i my projector behind me shelf , near ceiling , it creates angle projection . keystone flattens out picture , so it looks like it should . negatives : not many but , few minor annoyances . 1 ) adjustment arm it not centered . why , i don't know . ceiling mount , it would no consequence . 2 ) lens cap , everytime i remove it , i refocus , minor detail . 3 ) it composite video , s-video , but you buy adapter component video . right now my component video adapter back order . however , i am using s-video , am very happy clearity my movies . i doubt if i could tell much difference component cables but , would like see . summary ; i paid less than $800 it , delivered my door . i play it 96 " diagonal . you cannot buy new plasma , dlp , or lcd tv , this size screen , price . i don't believe giving 5-stars product , unless it ultimate , every way . so , few minor annoyances , i give this projector strong 4-star rating .	-1
i am big fan ergonomic keyboards . you know ones split keys . my wrists hurt times typing work . well , i say i've using this keyboard week without wrist pain . i think flat design helps my wrists i no longer need wrist supports . my wrists flat desk keyboard . so helps awful lo t.t his comes all batteries you'll need get started . mouse recharge . keyboard won't . keyboard needs 4 aa batteries . so far , i no idea when it going die but i keep spare batteries case . feel keyboard more like laptop keyboard than traditional keyboard . there very little down stroke when you press key . no too springy either . function keys top not really keys but small depression you lightly touch . took some getting used . i'm not 100% sold design . i use arrow keys lot my work they're much smaller than most old keyboards i've used . there times where i've thought returning old keyboard just because . but i still like feel enough give this chance . mouse works fine . it mouse . it no logitech laser mx but it not bad . action fine . it nice keyboard mouse drive off one little bluetooth usb key . overall , i'd recommend this few reservations . if you're super sensative ergonomic keyboards don't like regular keyboards , avoid this . also , if you need 10 key or use arrow keys lot , this not keyboard you . beyond , you've got stylish cool keyboard good mouse	-1
my setup includes home-built windows xp intel mainboard power mac g5 , both fully updated . i'm using usb mac keyboard sony dvi monitor . everything worked flawlessly . manual isn't bad , but could better . i can't help wondering if some dissatisfied users haven't failed read manual closely , thereby missing detail or two . beyond plugging cables , little setup required . i make setup change accomodate mac keyboard . default , ports configured auto-detect keyboard types when connecting windows pcs . mappings keyboard types enable you enter any keystroke either type keyboard . example , my mac apple key executes windows menu keystroke when windows pc selected . only thing i'd love see switching optical audio . i 5.1 speaker system , i switch inputs systems manually . 2-channel audio switching works fine , however , that all specs promise . unit includes cable upgrading firmware . since mine works fine , i haven't looked see whether any upgrades available , but those who problems might check . i've worked several kvm switches over years . i very impressed this one . it compact , reasonably priced , includes required cables , worked well out box . i recommend it highly	1

i suspect lot negative reviews people axe grind blu-ray vs . hd-dvd battle . however , it now looking likely there no battle , most studios announcing intentions release movies all 3 formats . what made me take plunge netflix now offering good range both hd-dvd blu-ray discs . picture quality this player simply amazing , almost cinematic quality . uncompressed 5.1 channel output sounds great too . even standard dolby digital seems sound better than my old player . player very well built quite cool looking . it seem like current releases even better picture than early ones - like copy fifth element bundled player , this looks slightly lower quality than , example , babel ( just released ) . negative side , what most people referring long load time fact , boot up time . switch boot up player takes 25s . once booted load time movie fairly normal . i don't see boot up time big problem . nitpicking aside , once you've watched couple blu-ray movies you won't want go back dvd	1

i purchased this software more it street mapping detail than topographic mapping . living out here rural ky i yet find backroad or country highway isn't accurately mapped this software . even local bb , restaurants , filling stations poi ( points interest ) database . simply amazing . you easily define waypoints build routes . if you plan any kind road navigation your magellan handheld gps but also want additional features topographic mapping then this software get . i mention version 1.0 appears pre-date explorist series because there no built-in support direct download explorist . it takes extra step using magellan conversion manager software load regions into your explorist . not difficult all . 3d view option somewhat useless , it often not depict physical world closely enough meanigful . ability select regions downloading gps seems limited rectangular selections only . this works well enough most cases but irregularly shaped terrain it causes you select lot more area than you really want , which consumes more gps memory . maybe this limitation how mapping software works but freeform selection tool would nice addition . aware converting regions download takes lot computing power memory ! converting entire state like ky takes several minutes my 3ghz computer results 55mb download file ! overall this product well worth price	1

first all , i see there bit controversy out here hiss , whether sub worth money . i hope clarify this simple terms . begin , i audiophile quality system . conrad johnson , tandberg , nad , celestion components , yet moved into new home , i didn't want see all those components speakers my living room new wood floors . i hoped this system sub would fit bill , but rather skeptical , after reading reviews here . so here my vote . get model 2 , get sub . it all worth it , but you'll never " hear " it , until it set up properly . first off , i'm ham ; anyone tell you , you're only good your antenna . i used roof mount full size fm antenna my baseline reference , but didn't want it my roof . i replaced it quite nicely radio shack 15-1859 $24.99 . however , like speakers , placement everything . i put headphones tuned it difficult station , then moved antenna until it clear , so i could move free unit without front speakers listen . wa-la .. after few minutes testing , i attained absolutely noisless signal it ; perfect spacial seperation . next , i found speaker placement very critical set proper soundstage , get " it intended heard " seperation . i buy sub , but now , leave it turned off . also , don't rely leaving balance centered . i tweak it , so don't afraid . try putting some andres segovia keep adjusting balance until you hear " open ambiance " auditorium he played . listen attain spacial result . then you're set . now turn your sub . also , those who say sub isn't needed . fooey . it well worth money , provides third leg triangle truly present what this system . once all set , knock yourself out . it no brainer , yes , again ; sub " required " well worth it . references what this system , try patrick o'hearn/metaphor , andreas vollenweider/book roses , tower power/soul vaccination ( live ) . they let you hear what this baby . kinda like driving porsche straight road 40 mph , saying " it not hot " . context everything . hope this helped . again , what i found necessary , signal quality , speaker placement/balance adjustment , without sub ; then sub added . me , this system keeper , keep my former audio system packed away now . me , unobtrusiveness ; " invisible " components , " coming out ? " performance , coming out top , winning big . go it . it rare find , great value	1

sangean mmr77what most impressive this radio its relative freedom power issues . this radio very conservative its power consumption whether one using external 3-volt power source , set " aa " cells , or supplied 2 " aaa " cell internal-rechargeable pack . reading pre-sales description this radio one may mistakenly assume it plays only thirty minutes internal rechargeable batteries . fact what claimed one-minute cranking dynamo results 30-minutes playback . cranking two minutes result one hour playback . longer you crank longer it plays . when fully charged internal rechargeable pack operate radio reasonable volume level all day into nigh t.t he radio built-in replaceable " aaa " plug-in battery pack similar those found wireless phones . these batteries recharged dynamo . this pack accessible replaceable , after 300-500 recharge cycles , removing six-screws back case . further two " aa " batteries easily replaceable through access-port rear cabinet . radio also powered external source , solar-cell , wall-wart , or what you , through socket located under splash-proof cover left-side radio . dynamo handle sturdy . left-side case partially cylindrical shape . left-edge speaker grill actually rubber grip . radio well balanced easy hold while cranking dynamo . dynamo cranked either direction facilitating use either right or left handed people . lefties not able see green-led which illuminates indicate one reached adequate dynamo cranking speed . minor inconvenience . bottom case four rubber-pads which when combined radio weight cause it grip well flat surfaces . no tipping . overall build quality , fit finish , this radio very-good . splash-proof earphone port located next external power-port . both earphone channels driven , monaurally . radio internal speaker only two-inches diameter . this not boom-box , but sound emanates speaker very accurate within its effective range . classical jass music sound fine . if you heavy rock-listener you may yearn more oomph your everyday listening . primary purpose this radio provide information when lights go out , but it makes useful everyday radio well , previously mentioned exception rockers . there small incandescent bulb illuminates slide-rule tuning-dial provides enough-light externally small-tasks such reading your watch or business-card . lamp illuminated through small push-button front cabinet . there small push-button top cabinet . this button activates chirping sound through speaker . sound similar smoke detector , but not loud . this not seem like very useful feature but perhaps some you think use it ? switch top radio selects am fm bands . switch back radio selects internal dynamo powered batteries , or replaceable " aa " battery external power options . most importantly , addition all above , this radio very good sensitivity selectivity characteristics . analog-dial radio tuning may new experience any you raised digital-dial radios . vernier slide-rule dial this radio relatively small so one tune slowly deliberately isolate stations . however , once station tuned-in , one rewarded solid drift-free reception . audio free noise or distortion , surprising fidelity , good dynamic range , within limited range small speaker . i recommend every household one these radios , trunk car . when disaster inevitably strikes prudent use this radio source current information could allay further personal-suffering , or loss life	1

this fine pocket radio people who need something small don't want suffer interference using ac adapter . mini300 takes 2 double-a batteries . fm/am reception above average sensitivity . however , radio newbies go crazy drift , radio inability lock into desired station . you're better off spending 10 more dollars getting sangean dt 180 , which runs only one small battery , digital , doesn't drift . if you want something standing alone your office or bedroom , i suggest you buy best radio currently available , kaito ka2100	-1

if you buy it , you'll spending forty bucks stand no features zune doesn't already provide ( sync cable output , headphone jack , that it ) . this might worth buying if it came speakers ( you'd think zune would want provide accessories compete ipod instead making ipod look so much better ! ) . i suppose if you want waste more money buy remote ( sold separately ) , it might worth paying twenty bucks dock , but definitely not forty or whatever discount amazon might give	-1

i'm really happy a/v pack , it works exactly advertised . my only gripe , reason why i only give it four stars , sync cable it comes no longer than your standard sync cable , meaning you set you dock fairly close your power supply . but something should mentioned all official zune accessories i've used so far very high fit finish , dock no exception far more heft than it first appears . tiny details built into accessories just fantastic like , this case , magnetic remote ... brilliant	-1

casio kept true form this one . everything works we expect it , unlike my first databank watch , it light . word " light " rubbing out after this thing few years , i've replace resin band . aside , i get great battery life turning little beep feature off , sparingly using alarm , light . however , like all casio digital watches , this one always seems get ahead 30 seconds . so , you want reset time every month or so . i reset mine 30 seconds behind because i think it levels off some point . data not get lost when battery changed . calander display nice because you know glance something coming up this week , or next . pc-link , enhanced display , better band would make this definate 5 star product . color oled display would rock . let world their slips paper , notes books , fancy schmancy pda . this everything i actually need it	-1
