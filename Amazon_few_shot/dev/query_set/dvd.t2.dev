one those cases where everything goes wrong making movie : low budget , unispired performances ( alexis denisof particularly bad here ) , lack decent screenplay actors work upon , bad direction , despisable characters , cliched situations ... how kinski chose act this one ?	-1
maybe i loved original one too much , but this version story not work me . i especially dissapointed music oompa loompas . stick first one . it perfect	1
maybe because i didn't like porco . everything sub-par me . animation definitely not good his later movies . not enough weirdness , tried too much plot . everything just too ho-hum . if he tried carry whole movie porco shoulders . but once you got past fact everyone else human porco pig there wasn't anything else there .	1
i understand some fans would like see more their loved characters ( this series one best far i'm concerned ) , i understand need filling gap especually if show hasn't aired while tv : but i cannot understand anyone who buys this dvd any reason . you not need this dvd " fill gap your collection .

this film starts out so promising . it could punchy dramatic piece nature belief , legitimacy concept free . instead , characters dribble into infantile sexuality , film becomes travelog . i can't believe this film found financing ... real waste obvious talent . effect ending trivialise opening premise , hence film winds up exercise meaninglessness unpleasant aftertaste	-1

well , i just got watching this movie actually went out my way write this review . truthfully , i didn't catch last 20 or so minutes because i found myself doing other things around house could care less what happend . trailers dvd cover this movie very misleading . one would think they going see something great genre horror movies zombies group people doing whatever it takes survive . i'm big fan romero movies loved 28 days later so i thought this movie would cool australian take-off . i couldn't more wrong . nothing movie makes sense start . entire movie over top starting actors . everybody entirely too much dialogue except main character who hardly says two words during entire movie . she looks lost , confused , out her league . other characters include local pilot his pregnant girlfriend , " wacky " police sgt his asthmatic partner , bait tackle clerk who never screams during entire movie , our heroin character who won local beauty contes t.t he movie takes place small town austrialia somewhere . when meteors strike earth ( slam into people ) , it unleashes germ which causes people become zombies . our main characters all meet up try survive . however , aliens involved so story goes survival story beams light dressed capes floating around right middle big battle . viewer left wonder what going first , but dialogue story become unbearably bad , you find yourself not caring minutes tick . i honestly couldn't tell you much else because it just so terrible i just simply couldn't take minute more . bad acting , bad dialogue , over top effects , some worst camera work i've ever seen . this movie apparently took two years make ... imagine if they only one ??? portion this movie makes me ill bait tackle charater . he shows up out nowhere saves heroin life like bad clint eastwood impression ( big hat covering his eyes boot ) . then , he walks away . when he appears again , he able these matrix style backflips ( digging his " spurs " into wall/ceiling ) making two pistols jump over his back land directly into his hands . this guy ever miss ? what you think ? he manages kill 50 zombies his two pistols while hanging wall upside down . not bad bait tackle salesman living backwoods australia ! if you dig gore , this one ok ... but again , wayyyy over top . i no idea one bullet . 45 could blow someone half . our characters so clueless it actually takes them 3/4 movie figure out how shoot them head . i personally counted several scenes where character shooting police revolver somehow manages get 13 shots out 6 shooter . someone get nasa phone explain how you because i just don't get it . absolutely worst part this movie , without doubt , music . it never stops ! there never scene without music some reason ! it just makes what you're watching seem absolutely cheesy ! it reminded me 1950 serial/pirate swashbuckling kind thing guys swinging ropes jumping across gorge kind thing . soundtrack truly worst i've ever heard extra cheese included . they use up their budget effects ? probably ! i found myself wishing i could mute music during film ! if you're fan good monster / zombie movies , i beg you pass this one keep moving . it doesn't make sense , story amazingly weak , plot ... well , there isn't one ... you'll wish you could your 2 hours back . i know i !!!	-1

lord rings movies made superstars out dozens actors actresses . many gone star movies made lots money , but without awards critical recognition lotr movies . not so viggo mortensen . right after lotr he followed this awesome adventure story disney . coming out summer after pirates caribbean , this supposed disney next big live-action , summer adventure hit . unfortunately , it flopped box office . luckily , it made comeback dvd market , which where this reviewer saw it . all all , it great movie , probably one best live-action movies disney produced long while ; judging its ratings here amazon imdb.com . short , this movie frank hopkins , half-white , half-native american horserider who mired middle-age guilt self remorse . comes opportunity change scenery - trip arabian desert race . frank takes challenge his horse hidalgo they go . race across arabian desert tests both rider horse , introduces them cast characters only accomplished movie studio like disney could created . we strong-willed girl full innocence inner strength , fierce father tribe leader who suffers no insults his honor or intelligence , backstabbing fellow racer who smiles until final death , seductive beauty willing win any costs , arrogant prince no moral bounds , etc , etc ... it all reminds our protagonist his days montana ! during course race , which frank hidalgo win course ; both them tested limit . movie ends triumphal note both . rider redeems his guilt freeing hidalgo human ownership forever , freeing his consciensce past betrayals . soundtrack awesome , cinematography great , dialogue realistic , once , movie set foreign land actually uses actors area speaking language area ! my compliments disney cast crew this movie . i highly recommend it all audiences teenagers up	1
absolute best hitman hart : wrestling shadows . however , if you want newest interviews bret some best footage you see him his early stampede days wcw , this dvd get ! i'm so glad finally some excellent matches his dvd . my only complaint audio hart vs . austin match wrestlemania 13 off 2 seconds which doesn't sound like much but very noticeable when someone hits mat there no sound until few seconds later . but it not enough drop it down 4 stars . tributes his brothers owen dean well other fallen commrades including brother law davey boy smith , curt hennig , big boss man , rick rude , miss elizabeth others touching . they excellent job this dvd despite fact mcmahon give bs statement beginning bret " putting their differences aside " sake dvd . it very obviously dig unscrupulous shyster . if you're looking " montreal screwjob " match its entirety this dvd , you won't find it . it cut time ( bret said he wanted " de-emphasize " it this project ) but featured bits pieces documentary itself . thankfully bret hocking mcmahon shown several times which made me smile after opening statement mcmahon . highly recommended	1

there very few shows my lifetime i fiercely loyal , but now defunct `once again ' without question , topped short list . i admit my lifelong crush actress sela ward my main interest this series , originally . single , no kids , my late 20s during oa debut , i far out abc target demographic this show . i didn't expect like show very much , but i got sucked not because sela , but because show nothing less than fantastic . superbly acted superbly written , abc never gave this show chance find its audience , it bounced around time slot time slot until it all too early demise . even best shows need pitched correctly viewing audiences chance . premise story rick samler lily manning , two fortysomething single parents who re-enter adult dating scene after their divorces . they fall head over heels one , find life love ( then ) late 1990s far different than what they remember . adding children , careers , parents , ex-spouses mix just adds different layers complications challenges rick lily . most shows `jump shark ' some point during their lifetimes . while some could argue hostage episode s2 point oa , i disagree . once again always presented two kinds television : good , better . stories characters could fill you hope , heartbreak , or both every week almost without fail . best all - everything this show real . very little , if any , suspension disbelief required . perhaps best thing i say oa it only show i so passionate saving , i sat down wrote letter abc , asking them reconsider their canceling it ( part organized campaign other fans ) . while campaign wasn't successful , release ( finally ) series dvd allow those who loved this show then enjoy it forever , well allow those who didn't get view oa during its run discover it , they too , might find out why we who followed this show beginning understood this just beautiful story	1

" hell " meticulously produced some best cinematography i've ever seen horror movie . although story who jack ripper little contrived times , general plot interesting . all actors involved excellent movie grisly moments you'd expect , considering subject-matter . it keeps you interested involved whole two hours , not mention it looks beautiful . heather graham gang prostitutes put great touching performance , showing human side women unfortunate enough this profession victorian era , johnny depp amazing , usual , although ( others pointed out ) his english accent may little off , which i wouldn't know since i'm american . this film great entertainment i would highly recommend buying dvd ( if you rent it you'll more than likely end up buying it anyway , it good ) . " hell " makes great addition any movie collection .	1

upon seeing previews theater good company , my first instinct avoid it like plague . based apparent target demographic this film , it marketed horribly . trite title kitchy manner which preview clips edited reminded me too much those shallow adoloescent throwaway disney films - type hollywood routinely pukes out 14 year old girls . knowing dennis quaid penchant appearing such films , i assumed good company one those . recently however , i stumbled across movie opening credits hbo . " i'll stay long enough make fun it . " , i thought myself . but matter minutes , i completely sucked . writing intelligent tone often dark . this movie , surface appears natural born comedy , yet it resists obvious cornball pitfalls every turn . characters not 1 dimesnional buffoons , but written very believable people real problems . every time i smelled cliche or overly sentimental twist coming , film continued surprise me not taking easy way out . it perfect film ? no . good company not without its flaws . but they very few very forgivable . this one proof you can't judge dvd its cover	1

well folks , looks like we may most over praised movie current millennium right here . ( " crash " comes close , but film lot more detractors than this one , many those who liked it seemed so because they imagined , somehow , it would " change world " . ) my beefs not same most those who don't like film : i don't much care it may show unrealistic picture drug abuse , nor i find it overly depressing . fact , it isn't depressing all cause i didn't care . it just boring annoying , sometimes different moments , sometimes simultaneously . this not good combination . all right , here plot summary : jared leto , marlon wayans , jennifer connelly ellen burstyn all drugs , this really messes up their lives . i hate give it all away like , but there it . fundamental flaw this : i don't like any these people , so their pain doesn't mean anything , since all there this movie it absolutely fails any sort effect . maybe if aronofsky put more time characterization it would've worked , but now there just isn't anything there . far what actually movie , we've got jared leto stupid chunkhead who inane conversations his equally chunkheaded girlfriend jennifer connelly , who wants fashion designer , or something . beyond this we've got jared mother , ellen burstyn , who weird old woman marlon wayans leto friend who deals drugs him times appears headed towards big leagues . i particularly love how there no real attempt make wayans into person . he got one flashback how he wanted make his mom proud that it . doubly sad fact he most likable three . he least displays little life . connelly leto apparently just wandered here bergman film so dull slow it wonder smack doesn't cause them cease exist entirely . ( well , connelly actually coke , i think , but it fails liven her up any . also , i actually * like * bergman films i've seen , so that not really fair comparison . ) they love each other , apparently , but since i don't even like either them i'm not much interested . finally , burstyn mostly just creepy though her performance take turn hilarious she goes off deep end . perhaps it wouldn't funny if i cared her , but we've over ... i want you people know i'm not utterly heartless when it comes movies . i care characters , but none these people anything me , so movie dead water . good counter examples watch " trainspotting " , which drug-addict characters enough humor life likable interesting " bubba ho-tep " , film which displays plight lonely elderly 50 times better than this film despite silly horror-comedy mummy cowboy outfit it . other hand , neither those movies nearly pretentious " requiem dream " , so watching them nothing stroke your ego . still , if that all you want kinda find plenty films better than this one purpose . " requiem dream " isn't helped any darren aronofsky repetitive , derivative over-direction . trouble , this movie hasn't got any plot distract you how redundant visual style . there nothing inherently wrong any his tactics , but they're hopelessly driven ground , we see fast-motion thousand times , quick-cut montages million times plenty wonky camera-attached-to-the-actor junk , they , again , impossible not notice cause plot sure ain't drawing me . i imagine overdone , repeating visual style meant representation endless cycle found drug use , but doesn't make it any more pleasant or entertaining watch . score suffers same problem they use same handful themes over over . truth told , i thought this movie pretty okay first half , but then it really started grate me . it became evident no , aronofsky wasn't going introduce any new visual tricks no , these characters weren't going get any more interesting . i looked timer continuously last 40 minutes film , so uninvolved supposedly horrifying conclusion where all characters really get it bad utterly ineffective . it kind uplifting , really : now these tedious characters finally hit rock bottom i go something else . now that good ending . grade : d+ ps this 500 reviews . i doubt if i write 500 more , but who knows	1

david milch modern retelling black hills gold rush compelling it raw realistic . hbo , not censored any way it would commercial television , it provides us more honest rendering how human beings live act . this first season you'll shaking your head wondering if crazed gold rush days could so outrageous . right off i compared it gunsmoke , similar tale written produced television nearly half century ago . i think we're seeing things more clearly today . i think our artists more leeway their audiences won't sit still kitschification human experience	1
this film unbelievably good . i dvr'd it free speech tv , i watched parts it again again . every turn you blown away revelations this film , if you , like me , never thought much who controls mainstream media . first time i watched it i kept stop tape just cringe , letting import facts sink . talking heads people you may never encountered , but whom you unlikely forget . write their names down . check into their books . even if you don't buy film look list people it get their books . particularly incisive inquiries into most recent presidential elections . you there , i there , but lewis shows us ugly underside media can't afford let us see . this scary , take-to-the-streets stuff . finally , pappas deserves more well-known documentarian . if you put off michael moore whininess slightly embarassing approach , you may find new friend robert kane pappas .	1

menace ii society debut film directing duo hughes brothers , released 1993 height popularity " hood movies " . most other reviewers stated film extemely powerful look growing up l.a early 90 . movie grabs your attention straight away robbery liquor store controversial shooting korean owners , pace never lets up throughout . caine ( tyrin turner ) basically bystander opening scene o-dog ( larenz tate ) goes rampage , this continues throughout film , caine good person but very much victim his circumstances , whereas o-dog just " doesn't give f**k " . without going into plot details events film all conspire against caine it all catches up him inevitable ending . there also good performances jada pinkett mc eiht small role start samuel jackson caine father . while film very powerful sad realistic take ghetto life , it not without it faults , main one lack depth some characters . they never really explain caine relationship parnell , though he regularly refers him " like dad " throughout film . also several other characters hard sympathise their background never really explained ( something i felt better boyz hood ) , i find it hard believe parnell would cool caine relationship his girl . despite these minor faults film still great though ending particular tragic inevitable . one better hood movies early 90 , if your into them you should definetely check this out	1
this movie great . i remember watching it when i really young . im 21 now still love it . yeah some things corny but part what makes it great . its not suppose realistic . its fiction ! i just realized too daughter girl american pie which makes it even funnier . overall this movie pretty good . if you dont care story , atleast get it see kim other chicks movie . if you've never seen movie , just buy it . its same renting it couple times you able keep it . all you people who rated it 1 you issues !	1

' spun ' follows lives several methamphetamine addicts through their wasted , roller coaster days , but this not your ordinary ' drug ' film . ambience atmosphere so in-tuned this degenerated culture you smell illegal drugs cooking . giving plot away would moot , since it portrayal everyday life people this particular scene . so , what separates ' spun ' rest drug flicks ? gritty realism , hilariously bizarre scenes , atmosphere , some great acting , complete lack fear part creator director dive into nastiest behaviors expose them pathetic comical . sets what you see real life meth houses . dress behavior characters very realistic . my only real problem movie some jerk/flash camera work gets little annoying , but still serves its purpose bringing " tweak " screen . interspersed film some ridiculous cartoon scenes riot , two cops parody tv shows like " cops " " bounty hunters " , flash stills hilarious action music . i am going haunted forever spider mike ( john leguizamo ) scene where he jumping up down bed sock his unit while abusing himself . you'll see what i mean , leguizamo brilliant his role . mickey rourke proven himself quite actor , chameleon who adapt any role .

favorite steve mcqueen vehicle , sprawling western stretches bit too far . me , this just hip take western melodramas 50 . early scenes , mcqueen could helped cedibility great bit letting actor play himself adolescent . i believe this early harold robbins novel toned down into lengthy story . mcqueen character moves across land hunt those responsible killing his family , there wonderful life-changing moments . brian keith gun lore rapport mcqueen worth whole viewing . mini-scene within this adventure under-utilized , suzanne pleshette , swamplands louisiana . love nearly conquered , slowing story until mcqueen catches up karl malden his thugs . malden strong his scenes , but there too much horseplay end makes revenge bit silly wrong-headed , since any red-blooded man would run off pleshette anyway . right when you want mcqueen kill thugs , there some nonsense mission priest slows finish even more . cut-up shown tv , it tighter , more fluid story . like malden " left-handed gun , " film uneven crawls spots . we forgive this movie when sum mini-scenes not add up successful whole , fact editor not what best . i don't even remember what revenge mcqueen character end . 30 years later i watch movie see pleshette , keith mcqueen what casts 10 or so tv sitcoms never approach . kudos casting , thumbs down pacing .	1

this film gives insight into interwoven lives mike watt . boon more than overlook into band itself .

there lots passion wide sargasso sea book , but it mostly emotional . it extremely multi-layered novel work true master . film other hand just your classic , bad 1990s film , beautiful look , lots skin , languid copulation , heaving bosoms , bodice-ripping nonsense , etc next no substance . it no artistic integrity whatsoever , its shameless makers must surely know they lifted their middle finger spirit jean rhys novel when choosing make film way they . i unable feel empathy both lead character . much touted erotic scenes not developed what they lead believe , it also lacked much enthusiasm . they incomplete contributed little , if anything , plot . viewer only gets glimpse passion supposedly exists edward antoinette . therefore , they should either gone all way , tastefully ( no pun intended ) , or left those scenes out entirely . now regards plot this film there enormous holes , which perhaps could rectified reading book . but those who haven't read book , there should enough information film itself keep reader afloat . start it unclear what really going this family ( despite narration ) . why ex-slaves keep laughing ? ( something vaguely explained movie , though apparently fully explained book ) . why didn't parrot fly away ? what made mother go nuts ? no point movie mr. rochester " issues " , it , fully explained . man gets letter exposing his wife creole dumps her like hot potato , after ( christophene explains ) he one who came crawling her first place . what hypocrite . again , maybe this ultimate point , mr. rochester snob archetypical victorian englishman antoinette victim both his prejudice jamaicans . but none exonerates appallingly abrupt conclusion film . so , despite beautiful cinematography , this movie hopeless muddle . i'd highly recommend novel way : book you don't forget hurry . needless say i think you should give this insulting ( memory jean rhys ) film miss , especially if you've read novel : it'll just frustrate you , no matter how keen bit easy titillation you may feeling time .	1

curiosity entertainment kids teens given today , i happened watch this film tv few days ago . i could biased say movies aren't what they use kids , but this movie went beyond . this film depressing example how horribly some today youth growing up . i would not recommend this film anyway ( unless laughs its stupidity ) . film starts off our four ' rich girl ' characters strutting down street arrogance beyond words . arrogance , perhaps normal thing some teenagers . however , these girls appear filthy rich which very few kids could relate leaving them wonder why can't they rich little kids too ? goal these girls course - become famous pop-singers . unrealistic dream most but it seems moral film : " good life , you need become famous " . plot moral , not great one . characters little lessons , appalling . ' raven ' so caught up ' becoming pop-star ' experience she becomes completely self-absorbed . this probably one few morals presented well . don't become self-absorbed idiot . moving . our second character fails entirely bringing any good ideals . after some time working ' cheetah girls ' upcoming career she comes home throw tantrum her mother not there ( rather , she out boyfriend ) . real-estate agent rings her mother interest selling house , daughter picks up phone , rudely yelling agent how this house not sale ' because i say so ' pure teen angst . now she decides go out abuse her mother credit card all money it worth because this small episode . course when mum comes home , she not happy . but apparently it all ok when daughter cries out how her mother should there more her . perhaps if this real case child-neglect , this may ok . but this kid just selfish brat who needs find better ways get over minor issues . i really hope kids won't think its ok throw hissy fit next time they discover their parents go ou t.t he next character perhaps most insulting ' real world ' . raven makes occasional comment this character how trashy their fashion looks ( yes , their fashion looks perfectly fine actually ) . later film we realise our ' trashy ' girl actually orphan living poor foster home . it good idea ; however , this girl looks nothing like real ' poor ' girl . perhaps ' money isn't everything ' moral would fitted nicely here , but instead we're handed perfect fix : get your rich friends buy your clothes . forth character i won't comment i can't remember anything significant her . process becoming pop-stars course , very unrealistic , aside sell-out factor lip-syncing . ' cheetah girls ' torn following their original dream or selling-out just get exposure . their friendship hangs line because this raven refuses compromise . we given few inspiring quotes other characters which road raven should take this matter , then its all up wonderful climax res t.t he climax . toto fallen hole got dirty ( horrifying experience dog bearing perly white coat)poor raven so frantic , this obviously worst kind tragedy could happen life . god forbid we learn anything realistic like death family member or even this poor little pooch . perhaps case we'd even president united states turning up comfort raven , but no , it just dirty dog stuck hole , it only calls whole neighbourhood , police , fire fights local television news crew . such tragedy only resolve reconciled friendship ' cheetah girls ' . there we it . entertainment ... maybe . any benefits otherwise , i would personally hope not , they're not kind things i would like see kids teenagers these days . normally , if this film aimed higher audience ( ha ) i wouldn't see much problem it . but this disney film ... you know , ones meant inspiring kids , or least teach them some values life ? this just gave us insight disney own greedy mind .	-1

though i bought movie because i'm huge alan rickman fan , i found movie thoroughly enjoyable . kevin kine course wonderful , very amusing . alan rickman his best usual , mary elizabeth mastrantonio portrays fairly brave , courageous character willing assist kline character catch killer risk her life . touch suspense , this movie moves comfortable pace , i must say my favorite scene " stairwell scene " . absolutely hilarious ! if you haven't seen january man i thoroughly recommend it . only flaw ? not enough alan ! ( but , any movie he ever enough him ? not bloody likely ! ) . ok . after read other reviews this movie their thorough dislike it because it " overacted , bad , etc . " , i must state this movie not supposed serious . it comedy . semi-stupid comedy , but comedy nonetheless . i found what type movie it supposed , it works very well . it good cast ( lots stars ) , it doesn't take itself overly seriously , it just plain funny ! those found it disappointing ? perhaps you miss point . it not supposed thriller it not supposed taken seriously thriller . my opinion , " bad acting " cast perhaps supposed way . i said previously , i enjoyed film quite bit , i still recommend it alan fans anyone looking comedy semi-stupid satiristic ( sp ? ) " serious suspense movies " . take " bad acting " grain salt while watching this movie , lol . actors certainly	1
" four brothers " successful action film because it accepts its role action film . too many `entertainment ' movies lately trying something more process end up substantially less . i no problem experimentation within genre , but when so much experimentation fails it becomes films stick basics them justice become rewarding . " four brothers " just such film . it not perfect any means , times falls hopelessly into traps i mentioned , but when it sticks what it best it works better than any action films i seen while . john singleton finds pace tone drives heightens story characters doing so helps film could so drearily standard become something substantially more . rather than mere dull formula or misguided wandering , film achieves level lively entertainment , something which hollywood late trouble delivering . so what makes " four brothers " different ? first all story simple enough it more often then not bog down pace film . this not always true there certainly mid-film lull when various uninteresting plot twists revelations hold back good old-fashioned a@# kickings , but majority movie plot used progress , rather than hold back action . plus , nothing works better unapologetically violent exuberant action movie than story vengeance , " four brothers " best when not trying make any claims contrary . acting suits film also , especially mark wahlberg , who i often enjoy who here obviously enjoying himself , playing character boisterous aggressive enough suit wahlberg mischievous grin tough-guy looks . terrence howard icy cool always playing cop streets , barring overwrought performance chiwetel ejiofor victor sweet , mobbed-up head baddy , all actors fit their roles well . ejiofor certainly meant over-the-top , but just all scenes feature him , he just doesn't quite fit more street-level tone rest film . singleton often looks though he still trying direct music videos , which approach often works , often not . opening scenes " four brothers " great , singelton aptly sets tone action follow . scenes snow-covered detroit brotherly bonding played songs marvin gaye motown set real slick tone film works well . there stumbles , such heavy-handed thanksgiving dinner scene , but most part these sequences succinct enough establish genuine interest character , therefore , vest interest story follow . film picks up so pace , sometimes thrillingly , basketball game or various action sequences , sometime disappointingly , film insistence ill-fated blacksploitation sub-plot , but way which never boring . this ultimately true success film . it may reflection current state hollywood movies , but " four brothers " , all its faults misguided straying , particularly successful movie because it least never fails entertain . i fear i praised film too much here . don't get me wrong , i certainly rolled my eyes once or twice while watching ( especially very last scene ) disappointed more than few aspects film , but parts i critical disappointed mainly because parts work worked so well . wahlberg one reason , singleton astute eye slick entertainment , but main reason film worked because it content what : unabashedly shallow , lively , entertaining action film .	1

i am so glad i bought this survivor season ! i needed something watch i lay bed recovering back surgery , this perfect !! it definitely far better than first far i'm concerned . major players much more interesting than first- colby , tina , jerri , elizabeth , etc ., plus they endure much more hardship than first- fires , flooding , running out food , mike falling fire , etc . it much more fun watch survivor second go it , challenges harder , players smarter , outback terrain rougher than beach first season . great buy	1
really people , 5 stars ? while plot gantz seems like it would make great series , what achieved two seasons could two dvds . i kept wanting yell tv , " get it ! " i wanted know more characters i wanted see how they would overcome this strange situation they thrust into i wanted see more monsters . but alas , all i got dbz feeling fights going many episodes endlessly whining characters . art gantz beautiful . concept so cool . characters rich feeling . it just takes too long get point then leaves you empty confusing ending bad plot holes . definatly not 5 stars	1
this one my favorite movies i seen duval penn great this movieit cop working beat mixed up middle crypts bloods other minor gangs area , showing what cops went through those times history how some cops would sometimes cut some guys break but could wind up regretting it i would spoil any movie you thats all iam gonna say rent or buy it , either way you must see it highly recomende	1
clive barker good job original candyman . it truly cut above most horror movies . second movie medicore best my opinion but this one just horrendous . there no suspense all this movie acting deplorable . donna d'errico soft eyes but too bad she talks . lets hope this last sequel	1
i saw elizabeth first time when it presented bbc tv 1972 . i enthralled story elizabeth acting glenda jackson . i became quick fan both . facts ever present throughout , read several books english history era . thoroughly enjoyable acting , settings costumes utterly devine . must every home film library touch class	1
i caught glimpse this movie years ago i could not remember name but i know who stared it ... so when i went online get name this i pleased see sender it very good price ... thanks so much movie second getting it me so quickly !!! thanks again !!	1
any great art hinges upon how it able address conflicts person goes through one lives . ashes diamonds , tries bring out conflict individual trapped whether ends more important than means . he part revolutionary group assigned assassinate political figure , before assassination takes place , he affair bar girl . affair events thereof makes him realise futility violence whether revolution able achieve ends they working towards . brilliant film , best wajda it continue timelessness associated it	1
" killing me softly " one those scripts just don't give audience break - not only it set up improbable situation , but big " twist " end also mind-numbingly predictable ( unless perhaps you haven't seen thriller before your life ) . chemistry two leads also lacking ; fiennes brings some physical magnetism his role but far his acting concerned , he inexpressive bloke , while heather graham all too expressive - she overemphasizes every emotion her character supposed feeling making faces camera . besides , she not even attractive ; even her co-star this particular film , natascha mcelhone , blows her out water department . ending like when you ' jawbreaker ' candy your mouth , sweet good beginning but when you get inside its bitter sour . it obvious towards end movie it would turn out like it , i seen quite number bad movies figure it out so quicklyin spite all , chen kaige direction good , he creates some suspenseful moments . so i give film generous " ** out 5 " rating . but if you're heather graham fan you like this movie since she nude many scenes ; joseph fiennes fans you'll receive half naked perks .	1
excellent collection rascalism . we tandem teacher pet school out . these two films introduce miss crabtree ( june marlowe pretty teacher ) cycle . first one jackie cooper gang trying scare away their teacher potential sweetheart ( " she mean teampature " ! )-or so they think . school out features classic history exam-miss crabtee- " buddy o'donald , what paul revere say his midnight ride ? " buddy- " he said whoa ! " then we what amounts two very anti-racist gang comedies . pooch ( 1932 ) , white rascals band together help their black pal matthew " stymie " beard keep dogcatcher killing his cannine pal pete . dogs dogs ( 1931 ) , sherwood his mena mama won't let stymie come play dorothy wheezer , but guess who helps save day ? spooky hooky ( 1936 ) later generation rascals ( spanky , alfalfa , buckwheat , porky ) trying retrieve phony note their teacher . gang ( janitor dudley dickerson ) gets scared out their wits skeleton dark . even my nephews , who don't usually take well black white films , enjoyed this one . dog heaven ( 1927 ) not so hot . not one better silent our gangs ( which i usually treasure ) , this rather crude entry beloved pete trying hang himself ( rather graphically , i might add ) after his master joe deserts him yonug girl . comedic canine also shown using his paws hold up bottles bootleg liquor get drunk despondency . yuck ! keep kiddies away this one ! other than , typically great collection	1
time flies when you this workout ! but don't let it fool you - this great , intermediate-level workout . warm-up get your heart pumping hurry . instructor , allie , cues impeccably all people working out video inspiring . cardios moves 6 " segment fanny lifter especially fun . my only criticism there not enough cardio emphasis this " cardio sculpt " video .	1
i saw this movie when it first video , maybe 15 years ago . my sister-in-law rented it us watch she seen it thought i would enjoy it . it during thanksgiving holidays , i'll never forget how this little film practically ruined my thanksgiving ! i so terribly depressed after watching it , i couldn't get it out my mind . no other film ever struck me way . word wise : don't see this if you mother young kids ( my youngest two , boy girl , little time ) . you won't able get sophie " choice " out your head . otherwise , it great film , no doubt . superb acting , writing , cinematography , you name it . just terribly , horribly sad . period	1

i guess i understand why this movie so savagely criticized during it year release , 1986 . prince still enjoying huge popularity based largely success " purple rain , " both film soundtrack . critics love knock someone off pedestal , which what they prince those days . many claimed movie nothing more than ego trip . they couldn't believe prince nerve fire director then assume role himself . it all way too harsh criticism movie isn't trying anything more than fun romantic comedy . course , poor critical response alone doesn't usually keep public making movie popular . yet " under cherry moon " bomb he box office . probably main reason this movie , although shot color , released black-and-white . some unfathomable reason , general movie-going public more often than not horrified prospect seeing black-and-white movie . now don't get me wrong , i'm not claiming movie released color people would flocked it droves . i'm only saying it would attracted more audience if it color . i acknowledge this movie target audience prince fans . since i am one myself , most my life , i'm not most entirely objective viewer . but i make no apologies my love this movie . it not " guilty pleasure " me , because i proudly hold this one my favorites . i only seen it couple times before dvd release - unfotunately i missed it theaters ( i couldn't get anyone take me , i only 12 none my friends into certainly not my parents - though my dad went me few years later see " grafitti bridge " opening night , but that review ) . but since it dvd release 2004 , this become one my most-watched discs my collection . soundtrack killer , tunes make up one best prince albums ever . there even some great stuff heard movie didn't make album ( some which issued 12 " vinyl ) . plus , i think movie looks great - cinematographer michael ballhaus , who multiple academy award nominations his credit ( dp numerous martin scorsese classics ) . i wonder how movie would feel color , but i think black-and-white right way go . even though movie set then-contemporary times , it feel something ' 30s . there so many classic moments this movie , i won't try list them all . but here few ... christopher tracy ( prince ) giving his " bela lugosi eyes " ... tricky ( jerome benton ) tossing rose petals into tub while christopher takes bath ... christopher freaking out when he sees bats eatery ... " wreka stow " scene ... car race christopher mary sharon ( kristen scott thomas ) . acting , i've heard lot people saying prince performance no good . i don't see much truth claim . after so serious " purple rain , " it nice contrast see him so loose funny this . jerome benton proved he could just fine even without morris day his side ( " purple rain " ) - i'm surprised jerome hasn't much additional acting outside prince movies . obviously kristen scott thomas moved this , her first major role , become oscar-nominated , highly repected leading lady . how dvd presentation ? pretty good , such largely overlooked movie . widescreen transfer 2.0 stereo mix aren't anything phenomenal , but get job nonetheless ; movie looks sounds fine . features , anyone expecting full-blown special edition like 2-disc " purple rain " disappointed . but least it not completely bare-bones release - four music videos included , though unfortunately not presented optimal audio/visual quality ( though they passable , i would've preferred 5.1 mixes ) . highlight live performance " anotherlover " which taken never-released ( least not domestically , not sure if it saw light day anywhere outside u . . ) concert video documenting parade tour . mtv held interesting ( i . . - very weird ) contest determine where " under cherry moon " would it world premiere . ten-thousandth caller mtv hotline would accompany prince premiere , which would held their hometown . mtv ran special covered premiere party - unlike premiere " purple rain " unfortunately this program not found " under cherry moon "' dvd release . lisa barber contest winner , movie indeed premiere her hometown sheridan , wyoming - very unusual place big movie premiere . when asked what he thought town sheridan , prince summed it up single word : " purple .

baba ram dass one major spiritual influences my life during early ' 70 . i discovered his books tapes just time i decided change my college major anthropology religious studies . it books like : ' here now ' , ' only dance there ' more recently ' still here ' continue break through my rigidity thought open my mind heart new vistas understanding acceptance . i priviledge meeting ram dass back ' 76 after talk he gave shrine auditorium los angeles , ca . during brief moment his presence i experienced unmistakable flow energy emanating this ex-harvard professor , turned subversive lsd user , turned hindi guru devotee hanuman , monkey-god . i felt totally alive , empowered so bursting emotion i didn't get wink sleep nigh t.t hrough years i've met , or stood presence numerous famous spiritual figures wide variety faiths traditions i honestly say i've never experienced anything comparable what enveloped me night ' 76 i looked into smiling , grandfatherly face ram dass . seeing ram dass old , infirmed confined wheelchair since his stroke ' 97 takes little getting used , but once you gaze deeply into those mischevous eyes see knowing smile you realize he hasn't changed bit . least not concerning things really matter .

this one my favorite movies now , no exaggeration ! i seen it 6 times last week , thats only because 3 those times commentary , which way , 10 times funnier than already hilarious movie ! i showing this flick all my friends they all absolutely die laughing . if you love ucb you love this movie - if you never seen ucb , you still probably enjoy this . i can't stress enough how funny commentary either - its just matt walsh ian roberts riffing off each other duration whole movie - they say absolutely nothing substance production movie , its great ! buy/see this movie	1

i am not fan reality tv shows but i am huge fan lisa kudrow . there cool distinction her performance/presentation i seen most her work . i dying see this dvd since i didn't chance see it tv . i am not sure what could inspiration creators producers make show like this . i think it incredibly original show . it written perfectly every scene worked out detail . but definitely not show massive audience . when i watched show very first time , i million mixed feelings . i completely confused . i didn't know what think valerie or rest characters . after i seen it more than once , i able pick up more details written into show . it truly unique show many levels . lisa acting absolutely amazing . she nailed completely every single line scene . my favorite moments show valerie " personal video diary " moments . there so much irony those . i cracked up every one them . references she makes pop-culture past very refreshing appropriate . music used show plus . i love character valerie cherish . she lots qualities great moral values . actress i think valerie fans similar lisa kudrow fans . valerie bit outsider , uniquely beautiful best sense humor . i love her comebacks - i think they hysterical . her facial expressions so funny way makes her every scene original . valerie definitely someone , real life , i would love around me . i don't think valerie character " anti-phoebe role " any way . valerie just not phoebe . thing threw me off little , michael patrick king comment ( his commentary very last episode season ) , madonna " stole valerie look her last tour " . i guess he meant madonna red-hair look cover coad which legendary madonna/steven klein collaboration . i don't know what think comment ... so , sum everything up , this show takes tv level . it pushing envelope ... essentially , it positive message . it would " thrilling " if comeback comes back tv .	1
set 1986 , ballad tells tale ailing wealthy counterculture environmentalist ( jack ) his teenage daughter ( rose ) living abandoned commune . years ago it prospering but all members left , including jack wife , only jack rose remained . they spend their days quiet contentment , gardening , farming -- launching two-man guerilla attacks housing development other side island . living near isolation , jack rose develop incredibly close bond , one threatens become incestuous . terrified this development , jack asks his secret mainland girlfriend her two teenage sons live them . new ' guests ' unwelcome development rose life . she incredibly possessive her father retaliation this intrusion , she tries seduce two boys kill kathleen ( girlfriend ) . jack wit end eventually , things cannot go they nor they continue coexist new situation . he two choices neither which idyll . this where movie goes awry . movie keeps everything very natural level , no overwrought music , overreactions . this works most movie yet these events too alarming characters ignore . after rose tries shoot kathleen , all characters choose ignore rose unhealthy jealousy . they blame her behavior wild child-ism , result isolated society too long . while this case , it also annoying . rose character too much petulant child instead wild child . her acts became increaingly dangerous , more i wanted someone finally tell her enough enough . character jack equally unlikable . he chooses ignore his daughter unhealthy attachment when he fully accept it , he continues encourage it . this may fully organic development characters their relationship , but doesn't mean it entertaining . despite controversial relationship , movie vacillates smug boring . performances good , my favorite those paul dano , ryan macdonald , catherine keener girlfriend her two sons , there naturalness their acting oddly lacking depictions jack rose . perhaps intentional . jack rose not much real people they idealized environmentalist versions fairytale king his daughter , living grand isolation until advent evil stepmother , kathleen . only this case stepmother isn't evil new family more entertaining then main characters . there extraneous subplot beau bridges housing developer serves metaphorical commentary jack rose reltionship , but like rest movie it too smug meaningful .	1
i can't believe i received it so quickly it cost so little	1

this second dvd taylor mason , i fully expected some repitition , due fact many comedians tendency repeat much their material . however , everything fresh if i hearing him first time , it just funny first one . mason every bit funny cosby , if not funnier . he pokes fun himself , which makes whole thing hilarious , he load talent , his ventriliquism music adding it . great everyone	1
this great set any pacino fan . hmm , it great set even if you're general film fan ! scarface ( arguably al best film performance ) carlito way take you into latino crime scene . al oscar-winning performance scent woman leave you screaming quot ; hoo-ah ! quot ; week . unfortunately , though , they included sea love rather than one al better films such dog day afternoon or serpico . when godfather coming out ! all all , though , this great starter set	1
there reason why they talk " voice angel " -- it because charlotte church certainly doesn't acting presence one . her acting debut " i'll there " proof enough -- only presence its star got this tepid little drama into theatres , where it rapidly dropped out sight . rightly so . seventeen years ago , paul kerr ( craig ferguson ) love rats fling groupie concert . fast forward present : kerr discovers unknown him , his ex rebecca ( jemma redgrave ) gave birth daughter , olivia ( charlotte church ) , who now well-adjusted paper girl . problem , olivia kept secret her dad . rebecca embittered , but kerr wants get know his daughter , similarly olivia wants get know her father . music seems thing bring angel-voiced girl burned-out rocker together , but rebecca doesn't want her child follow her father footsteps . " i'll there " hyped months advance inspired life actress liv tyler , who , despite only her twenties , immensely interesting life . well , maybe someday she get biopic , because " i'll there " only similar one way : it involves rock star his daughter . otherwise , it boring every way tyler life interesting . forgettable script , not much humor goofy premise , movie doesn't lot going it -- it reads like disgruntled teenager absurdist fantasy , scripted church act out . not terribly interesting teenager , either . it gets increasingly ridiculous when olivia decides pursue music bond daddy dearest ; it obvious ploy show off church vocal skills . best said church performance times she looks sweet . acting talent , she bland best , but she perform some good songs , her voice pretty ever . just watch songs fast-forward her actual scenes . redgrave good job she , ferguson wrings some pathos his performance aging rocker . his only memorable role film , it shame movie didn't focus him rather than dull miss church . miss church appears chosen role glorifies her middle atrocious film -- also known britney spears approach .

i just saw dawn dead first time . i actually saw remake first , which i liked . , course , i've seen terrifying night living dead many , many times probably see it again this halloween . so going , dawn dead little behind eight ball , so speak . but considering large number preconceived notions i regarding film , i enjoy it would recommend it . con pro : con : i truly believe greatest horror films black white . dracula , frankenstein , mummy , diabolique , psycho , course , night living dead , me , masterpieces just wouldn't same if shot color . shadows darker , deeper more sinister . danger menace seem lurk around every corner . night seems fall over proceedings like shroud , waiting swallow up everything . perhaps it part director george romero satire consumer culture prompted him shoot film bright colors . however , i kept thinking spooky quality grainy black white photography first film dawn dead suffered little bit comparison . color especially jarring when blood shown . romero wanted bright , unrealistic quality blood -- sort like comic book . however , effect this make blood look like spilled raspberry smoothie . film very scary , but might more so romero shot it black white . however , romero wisely stuck philosophy original when it came casting . probably because budgetary constraints , he cast unknowns pittsburgh area film . remake dawn dead released 2003 good , but it big studio film recognizable actors like ving rhames . when actors people audience knows , there separation takes place . i thought several times during remake , example , there no way ving rhames could killed off early film he most recognizable star ( i right ) . part what made night living dead so terrifying we didn't know actors . anyone could killed any time . nothing sacred ( johnny gets killed off immediately , tom judy burn death become zombie food , karen dies kills her mother , etc . ) . romero continues this tradition dawn dead . we no history these actors , so it becomes easier think them their characters . most us no safety net knowing actors previous work , so we no idea who going live who going die . it adds level horror missing remake . overall , dawn dead worthy follow-up night living dead . like most sequels , it doesn't quite match up , but unlike most sequels , drop-off isn't much . romero jazzed up formula satire dark humor , but he still manages scare hell out audience	1
i state all my south park reviews , i love this show personally colorado i take great pride this show comes my home state , season 6 great many fashions my personal favorite professor chaos , ( butters trying supervillain but just doesnt quote get it right , simpsons it episode just name few great episodes . sputh park great its own aspect , i just hope they keep up all these new great shows time grows ..	1
this movie so touching magical . once i've started watching it ( can't even count number times i've watched it ) , i find it hard press stop button . buy it you won't regret plus , i think charmed " stole " gist this movie , if u catch my drift * wink	1
" tristram shandy : cock bull story " reminded me bit altman film--it story within story novel filmed -- but it really chaos life . it bit amateur film feel it , draws one into middle making film . film opens vignette vanity actors -- my teeth too yellow ? i look good big nose ? should i get chin tuck ? am i too short ? characters move out , it not always clear who who -- agent , nosy journalist , moneymen ( women ) , history expert , girlfriend , pretty assistant , babies . some scenes truly hysterical -- all you need know almost all sterne novel happens before narrator born , filming birth hilarious . this film not linear plot types , or those who bothered heavy british accents or mumbled dialog . it sly , quirky -- but i liked it much more than i expected	1

eagle landed may seen two movies , out synch each other . first very fine move driven ensemble cast just right touch wwii era characters . donald pleasance scary powerful , pathological himler , duvall trapped , brilliant intellegence colonel german high command , sutherland brilliant charming , ruthless ira spy . even minor characters well drawn not give off false notes . jenny agutter convincingly plays local young women who dragged her heart into events jean marsh troubling nazi spy who insinuates herself into english country life . " other " movie burdened almost impossible believe framework fantastic details plot , which two-squad group crack german commandoes kidnap churchill seaside report disguised polish troops , help ira spy who there less than week . course , armed only phony letter hitler urging himler , intellegence colonel going set this whole thing motion provide command , control liason . , germans going wear their real uniforms under fake polish ones , some reason honor escaped my understanding . anyone any undertanding hitler war machine , british homeland defense or wartime bunkering churchill , all this too much suffer gladly . so , fine cast moves , driven reacting events logical within framework plot , which incredible . end , personal stories characters win out , quite memorable , while plot line seems , narrator-like figure says secrecy portrayed event , like it " ever happened .	1

those who haven't seen this film , above line spoken william bendix refers constant japanese naval air bombardment wake island u.s. marines civilians endured base . i always fascinated " famous last stands " american military history , story wake island one most famous . this classic war movie , while over 60 years old , still very meaningful entertaining today . yes , some historical details missing , but brave determination wake island garrison wonderfully captured . brian donlevy , who usually stuck supporting roles , gets top billing this time great job . william bendix , one my favorite actors this period , steals every scene he his typical tough-guy-without-a-brain role ! many view movie portrayel japanese unfair racist , but remember this movie released only months after attack pearl harbor . special effects obviously dated , but they quite possibly best any 1940s war movie i've seen . director good job using authentic combat footage , except footage showing bi-planes (?!?) . course , war movie this old usual cliches present , but this movie aimed america cried revenge . there many scenes showing americans dying , yet eventual american defeat especially surrender wake island downplayed ( surrender isn't even included film ) . if you want know full story wake island , there several great books available . if you love classic war films , add this gem your collection	1

my wife i throughly enjoyed all six dvds this collection . we enjoyed it so much we both next set four dvds . while it not necessarily follow scripture exactly it very close . i am sure some things left out it would hard film . if you intersted historical background hebrews their daily lives struggles this great resource .	1

- reviewone way or , we people relate jersey folks " clerks . " me , i may not lived nj , or work crappy job , or girlfriend who gave oral-sex 37 guys ( 38 if i included ) , but i understand one key perspective one main characters : life full disappointments . " clerks " not disappointment , but it reminding tale how disappointments lead resentment , or least lead whining . i find it impossible give lengthy opinion film like this without hinting any repetition . what else this film hasn't said already ? some acknowledge effort kevin smith put this project , through sacrifice selling everything he , result leads this certifiable piece indie . i one constructive criticism " clerks " , i'm sure that irked many times , but still that one thing which hold film back what i think would truly awesome : acting . i don't mean obvious-amateur audacity flaw , it script . script smart cleverly-written , but when people actually reading lines , dialogue bit farfetched . some characters alright their acts , but others act like they're just reading script only hastened their performance just hide fact . randall sadly one others , though his role natural , his cohesive monologues anything but . seriously , no one ever talks like . then again , i'm criticizing people who no cinematic experience whatsoever . other than , " clerks " likable film likable characters , if you handle harsh obscenity , which it ... lot . i certainly like randall , despite my issue him , mostly because his outrageous personality . he say whatever he want whatever he likes , he doesn't give damn anyone , except dante ; he free-spirited crass manner very unapologetic . he a-hole fans rooting . dante not so bad other half , his " i'm not suppose here " mentality makes him relatable character . this film just taste " snootch-to-the-nooch-ness " things come , which created insane iconic duo jay silent bob : say what you them , these two won't stop . " clerks " dealt not only star wars references made geeks nerdgasms , but it dealt most thought-provoking subjects ever discussed , like ' not sucking your own ****' . no wonder movie cult hit mid 90s ; course , i only elementary school back then , so i didn't know much it . but watching movie proves this day , it still fresh , absurdly funny , insightful handle new generation . this del keyes , saying " they might not like us , but we like them .	1
this show great . i think this become my favorite show tv . i love everything this show . actors , storylines , scenery , special effects , everything great this show . i don't see how anyone would not like it . i think jensen jared really give you feeling they truly brothers . very well acted their part . i hope this show doesn't get canceled or stars decide quit . i think i'll watching rewatching this show it good	1
just i said volumes 1 2 : batman animated series . boy i wait long time it finally grace dvd . but it out it great . same applies volume 3 . it introduces one my favorite villains : ra al ghul . all episodes ra all interesting ( maybe showdown least , because it not much batman - or him matter - little ra ) , plus i love ra ' voice . it introduces new hero too : batgirl ( shadow bat ) . you even get know some backstory alfred lion unicorn . i really like fire olympus - guy gets so confused running business , he considers himself greek god ( zeus ) he thinks batman his dark brother , hades . wait till you see ending . bullet bullock hilarious episode , not just because batman working guy hates him most ( though i doubt batman likes bullock ) . even more fun joker harley quinn ( judge joker trial ) . now essence batman ( my opinion ): his silicon soul , one greatest episodes entire series . i just can't describe it - see yourself . i like lock-up lot too - guy goal similar batman , only different methods . unfortunately , volume 3 episode i dislike most well - terrible trio . i also found bane pretty weak ( not physical sense ) compared comics . this dvd similar number commentaries ( even single video commentary ) , though only one featurette . so it bit weaker than volumes 1 2 . nearly same conclusion before : i watched batman animated series kid tv i loved it then i love it now . it something special , because this cartoon far cartoony ( unfortunately new batman adventures heading there , some episodes quite so ) . they just this great mood , producers series call them " minimovies " , that what they truly . believe me , many waaaaay better than actual movies ( not only batman ones ) . only exception this one gets 4 stars , because it less special features	1
great material , all wrestlemanias ( xvi-xx ) 5 double-sided discs . excellent image sound . too bad all wwf logos blurred which get distracted ( specially turnbuckle ones during matches ) but thats pretty much only flaw . definitely worth buy .	1
much i like paul newman , this movie very disappointing once you've seen far-superior film " day one " . portrayal oppenheimer groves overly dramatic totally unlike behavior real professional people . movie dwells romantic side stories instead fleshing out history science manhatten project . sure see " day one " if you interested this , give this film miss	-1
movie fairly boring . beckinsale also pretty dumb . what kinda actress doesn't shave her armpits when she knows she nude scene . total turnoff !!	1
creators this dvd really know how cater baby minds . it simplistic imagery ( mixture nature scenes , puppets , real children toys ) gentle music , minimal talking , which just what babies handle tender young age . my son ( now 12 months ) loves baby neptune watch it over over again without getting bored . i find it better than some other baby einstein dvds because its simplicity slow-pace . i highly recommend this dvd parents trying find intro program their young babies . my son get scared first two times or so puppet fish pops up , but after he fine	1

quot ; heistquot ; , well , heist movie like so many others . this one goes completely book uninspired all levels . gene hackman gives standart , average performance burglar who starts problems his mates . this quot ; who fools who ? quot ; picture , it some required though predictable twists end character motivations remain unclear . fact , characters themselves remain unclear , since they don`t speak all much dialogue poor . acclaimed director david mamet glues scene after scene little creativity , so most them turn boring lifeless . this just seems like weak episode some late-night cable b-tv series . dull , unsurprising shallow , one avoid	-1

long-time fan corrs owner all their dvds ( including " live london " , " live royal albert hall " " unplugged " ) , i must agree previous reviewers this creme de la creme set ( all them excellent ) . what sets this one apart energy level emotions brought out homecoming dublin crowd . clearly , this more than just concert corrs . though i wish set included couple more covers interspersed their popular hits ( i really get kick out their concert very unique covers hits such little wing , everybody hurts , ruby tuesday , summer wine , et . al ) , group top form here . highlights include previously mentioned " runaway " , sharon caroline beautiful duet " no frontiers " ( performed much more emotion than unplugged dvd ) , rare performance ( hard rocking , , least them ) " secret life " , extended version traditional " lough erin shore " . i only wish vh1 live dublin performance would come out dvd	1
i hope people don't start think this movie alien 5 . my mind this whole new venture , one separate any work sigourney weaver first four alien films . first 4 films pretty good i really like whole series . it works rather well i would love see alien film sigourney it . i think they could pull off one more film . ripley great hero . this movie pretty bad . only reason i give it 2 stars because special effects . i felt like i watching scooby doo version alien . whoever greenlit this film clearly just wanted make money . plot .. well .. stupid atmosphere movie pretty much non-existent . each first four alien movies provocative some sense no doubt because sigourney involvement . this one boring white wall it cheesy funhouse state fair .	1
producing successful sequel such truly new unusual ( not mention highly successful ) film ring daunting task . you can't just tell same story over again , yet any moves new direction apt decried loyal fans original . i usually try review film immediately after watching it , but case ring two , i allowed several days go - thankfully so because my appreciation this film grown over time . certainly , this film not good original - how could it ? after all , we've already seen samara all her glory , we've even spent some time well . shock value ring two just can't compare original . believability also rears its ugly head here , samara unreal powers grown , real sense , taken flight sequel . this no longer people watching tape dying seven days later ; remember , rachel freed samara well end first movie . she more dangerous than ever now , her desires changed - she wants more than vengeance now . i think it quite coup get hideo nakata , director ringu ringu 2 , direct here , but i think vision he brings this film also explains part disconnect we've seen some fans ring . japanese approach horror quite different our own . american audiences used shown things , oftentimes explicitly , while japanese horror much more subtle , symbolic , spiritual . it this cultural divide , i believe , leads some ring fans label this film poor sequel . adapting japanese horror american audience quite challenge - just look grudge , film even i felt just didn't work . ring , all symbolic clues , especially those videotape , basically led something - namely , samara story location her body . ring two not lay out such clear pathway hero or viewer ; symbology much deeper abstract this time around . it not this causes confusion part viewer ; it just much story plays out level many viewers not culturally suited experience . that why i would recommend watching all bonus features this dvd - they certainly helped hone my appreciation what i just seen . story , you rachel keller ( naomi watts ) her son aidan ( david dorman ) leaving seattle moving astoria , oregon shortly after events first movie played out ( it supposedly six months later , but hideo nakata says two years production notes ) . rachel still suffering somewhat sense guilt ( over passing tape other innocents order save her son ) , but she aidan both trying start their lives anew forget samara . that all well good , but samara not forgotten them . that obvious after local youth dies horrible death under mysterious circumstances - rachel quickly left no doubt whatsoever samara found them . we quickly move beyond cursed videotape , however , samara works exploit her unique connection aidan . this time around , rachel cannot save her son through anything approaching conventional means , nor she rely help anyone else , now including her son . increasingly desperate , she decides trace samara history before her adoption morgans , eventually finding speaking girl actual birth mother ( sissy spacek quite memorable cameo ) . it looks like all drama leading up fairly predictable ending - but just remember film never over until it over . naomi watts basically carries this movie her back , she filter through which we view everything happens . up until now , i never really appreciated watts actress , but i now . david dorman story me , though . while he able deliver some very effective scenes , times i can't help but think he attended hayden christensen school acting . sure , he little creepy , but now it televangelistic way - me , he looks like combination jim bakker young macaulay culkin . i love samara , though ; thankfully , nakata chose not go cgi route her all ( even still , she not half creepy her original japanese counterpart ) , which would made mockery whole creep factor . cgi used , unfortunately , deer dominate one memorable scene . i understand how real deer could not used , but this particular scene , after starting out very effectively indeed , ultimately ruined ridiculous obviousness cgi animation . unlike ring , ring two packed special features ( although we still don't get commentary , unfortunately ) . easily best bunch short film called rings , which sort prequel rings two . i really liked idea played over these 15-20 minutes - underground network teens who watched videotape , recorded their increasingly disturbing experiences long they could stand it , then passed it fellow newbie before their seven days up . this impressive short film , you get series excellent making-of featurettes featuring surprisingly lengthy set production notes , information cast crew , some nineteen minutes deleted scenes . altogether , it impressive package truly excellent , some degree , misunderstood motion picture	1
i really enjoyed this tv series when i younger seen every episode , so finally getting them dvd special treat me . seasons 1-3 great ! i looked up john amos ' character " james " . me , james what i needed growing up without dad home . so kid , when i first saw episode where he dies since i really looked up james , i felt florida evans family i even went into bathroom cried after episode because i didn't want any my family members see me crying . my understanding , john amos constantly frustrated voicing his opinion writing wanted see more positive situations written into show . i guess people cbs thought they knew enough african-americans who watched show assumed we could never relate anyone us getting our lives together actually moving up world . so they gave " good times " ultimate change : what could worse thing could happen poor black family both parents struggling make ends meet keep family together ? one parents dies or gets killed !!!! this exactly what cbs when they fired john amos , they killed off his " james " character insuring he never returned . now florida single mother taking whole load herself without strong pillar james hold her up . but like my mother , she remained strong somehow even more strength than she knew she . when i'm watching these episodes , it if i'm receiving motherly advice i watch listen florida advise j.j. , thelma michael . overall , i enjoy watching these old episodes many times i like . thank you esther , may you rest peace	1

superb casting dark , realistic character storyline make this one best crime dramas ever . deniro character really deep inside not want live anymore since life he knew it basically over ( life crime drives him ) . he also love not understand not know how deal it . he makes stupid mistake end letting his emotions cloud his decision making , but it really mistake or death wish disguise ? pacino fulfills his wish . pacino character just driven but opposite direction . two sides same coin , same coin , different face . just deniro cannot let go what killing him neither pacino . it takes deniro life leaves pacino alive but missing best life , thus he also dead , walking dead .	1

far ice vehicles go this one pretty good . ice gives totally believable performance former rap artist desperately trying parlay his past sucess music business into career bad actor . his acting probably improving though , but who tell ? unfortunately science cannot yet measure miniscule improvement his talent amazon not provide me option anything less than one star ... all aside , ice not totally blame this movie garbage-ness . script pretty weak supporting cast not very supportive . maybe i couldn't suspend my disbelief , but certain scenes , like all ones where people stealthy , they not stealthy , they clearly plain view people they sneak up . stealth bomber featured film spends most its time parked garage . when it attacks targets it certainly doesn't quot ; smart bombquot ; them ... nor it make any effort go unseen . it actually attacks broad daylight . i guess we supposed chalk up ice t lack flight experience . bottom line : if you name your movie quot ; stealth fighterquot ; then definition it should some stealth it . maybe its ironic . maybe quality movie quot ; stealthyquot ; making it appear if it without quality . bearing mind i give it no stars but it gets five stars -- all stealth mode	-1

i very impressed this story . i saw it theater , also this version dvd . this one most intense , longest , fulfilling movies available topic pornography industry 70 80 . very stylistic ( un)believable . ( c)ockumentary superior proportions . but it wasn't really documentary , just hollywood movie , based time , when porn coveted raincoat crowd . when i say ( un)believable , i mean story truely unbelievable , porn industry not man actor world , but clearly belongs female actor . she star this industry . so , when i see movie like this , i worry young men out there , who think they next " dirk diggler . " while , i'm probably over worrying concept , i still hope my words reach some man out there . this not reality . this fantasy , conceptualized hollywood director ; nothing more . reality , this could easily story written female actress , such rollergirl ? interesting enough , director fell into cliche , making rollergirl , victim . chastised her highschool classmates , ran out school . but reality , we know , know it jenna jameson tera patrick who real starts . i give this one 5 stars though , it really over top effort director . i quite impressed . two hard ones up ! this movie rocks ! mc white said : check it out !!	1

i finally got view tadpole --- few days after most recent presidential election . film nothing directly politics , but inadvertently it reminds one why democrats crushed last tuesday . aaron stanford aptly portrays fifteen year old oscar grubman , son columbia university historian ( late john ritter ) stepson heart disease researcher ( signourney weaver ) . this liberal elitist family living manhattan . needless add , their nonchalant attitudes toward sexuality , especially pertaining older adults enjoying sex young teenagers considered disgraceful majority citizens living red states . we observe precocious oscar wrestling ( often french ) his existential romantic challenges . eventually he beds woman her forties ( bebe neuwrath ) . this event not reported police . contrary , nobody wishes judgmental . teenage boy supposedly nature enough enter into such relationships . united states indeed split apart cultural war . red blue staters barely able comprehend world view each other . tadpole remind you just how serious differences . this movie ironically important manner which would likely surprise director gary winick . you need see it . this especially true if you wish take peek our national political future .	1

friend once who snickered my enthusiasm this movie . brainless cretin described it " chick flick " i give him long winded explanation why he once more way off beam . " goodwill hunting " classic guy movie guys who guy things . above all other story elements , this movie boyhood friends uncompromising loyalty those friendships . there scenes here should make you miss buddies you turned age , those great friends who there when you your first drink , chased your first skirt got into your first bar brawl . hunting genius becomes crux film . he genius , yes . but mostly , he young man typical frustrations misgivings come age . he issues girls , issues law , issues his own place world . this quickly became one my all-time favorites because it movie endless depth substance . story young punk criminal record outshining rest mathematical minds compelling start . so attempt bedraggled but committed psychiatrist reach boy weird friendship forms them . south boston serves beautiful shabby backdrop hunting feels himself drifting away his buddies his genius gets more attention world universities prestige he unfamiliar . he wants continue working construction hanging out seedy bars his friends , rather than his fluke ability exploited men greedy ambitions concerns over petty things like tenure . matt damon stellar streetwise hunting , orphan attitude . robin williams leaves his goofiness behind plays aging psychiatrist who once tough young man just like kid he trying help . while praising pair , no one should overlook talents ben affleck , who credible actor before he started landing tabloid covers . relationship damon affleck powerful . latter knows his childhood friend bound great things prods him achieve silent , macho way good friends . " if you're still here ten years , i'll kill you . that not threat , it fact . i'll freakin ' kill you , " affleck says , two take time beer during lunch break work . because how good friends talk each other when crucial matters hand . watching hunting battle himself he ponders idea flying away tough but familiar streets he grew up only half allure this film . each character comes into hunting world rich dynamic , somehow vital decisions young genius needs make . this one never far off my top five list all-time movie greats . not just because it great see tough southy intellectually thrashing silver spoon college kid , either	1

first off i agree warning not watch trailer first because it give away first set up movie . when denise richards sees matt dillion his student water fight os such says something like , " this just game boys , or anyone play ?

homosexuality still raises heated debates , homosexual community struggling equal rights . despite contemporary historical lessons this issue continues lead hate crimes our modern-day enlightened society . some still believe homosexuality disease or disorder treated while american psychology association discards this notion . yet , stigma remains , it often fueled heated emotions often rest within people values morals . this stigma seems divided people into two camps different opinions ; only time wisdom help people both camps come together . documentary , paragraph 175 , depicted through several archive film clips , which complemented several interviews few who still alive when film shot . through these interviews audience see emotion survivors display hear horrors they experienced through their trembling voices . documentary not disclose much what happened , but their faces voices tell more than thousand words . shame , anger , sadness intertwined emotions expressed through interviewees , they try tell their story not many thought important during last 50 years . years after world war i beginning allowed good life gay men women germany , especially berlin , where gay community blossomed . it time when gay community could live relatively open despite law paragraph 175 , which dated back 1871 . paragraph 175 stated , " unnatural sex act committed persons male sex or humans animals punishable imprisonment ; loss civil rights may also imposed .

" cubist " wrote exceptional review this one not live up type quality but i put my two meager cents . this first movie i ever saw stephen dorff . i college time immediately identified his character intensity actor . jack nicholson stupendous this role ( usual)and he ignites friction him his stepson , jason ( dorff ) . he on-the-outs wine merchant who debt say least . so order get ahead he , sleezy ex-con played michael caine , steal valuable necklace some rich snobs . dorff unintentially gets caught up mess his stepfather ( nicholson ) created plot thickens . this movie great drama solid performances nicholson , dorff , caine . brilliance these performances they subtle times not try cover over plot itself ( which due well written script really drive this movie well ) . jennifer lopez this one well plays nicholson mistress . her character really just annoyed me some reason i don't know why . perhaps it because i think times , movie itself wanted portray her woman strength i just didn't see it . her character weak lot ways annoyed hell out me . but ultimately , if you want see solid movie flies low under radar , i would recommend this anyone . thanks	1

it took me while get around it but i finally gave it chance . trailers clips made fight club look like film glorifying silly wwe-style backyard brawls . opening credits zoom out ed norton body up pistol held tyler durden ( pitt ) . norton narrates story bring viewer up speed . his character firmly enmeshed dull , desensitized slave toiling claims adjuster , easy , well-paid desk job . he rents high-rise apartment bloated designer furniture , name brand clothes , name brand food ... he addicted comforted male support groups . then , one day , woman ( helena bonham carter ) ups decides sit . chance meeting soap salesman tyler durden ( brad pitt ) prods norton character blow up his safe , materialistic life take residence dump edge town . he tyler ( pitt ) form support group called fight club . therapy sessions include gladiator tournaments designed amp up aggression . participants emerge pulpy but there no losers . they hirelings chumps outside world . brutish matches empower them . groups prior fight club reinforced their weakness , like e.d ( erectile dysfunction . ironically , member this group , steroid abuser , breasts ) . finally they club no woman would join , real men club . fight club stunning ultra-violent open interpretation including society addiction icons . tyler durden ( pitt character ) says : " things you own end up owning you . " solution , he believes , fight give up perfect . bruises , swollen eyes , broken teeth cut lips trophies . aspect movie idol worship . there one scene especially grotesque beautiful illustrating paradox fight club . norton horribly disfigures new recruit . asked why he replied nonchalantly he " wanted destroy something beautiful . " this , me , foretold direction organization towards vandalism . picture slick green hue similar sheen matrix movies , or hard , silver tint james cameron uses . cgi very effective throughout . norton fear exposed chaotic sequence showing his internal physiology . , picture jumps like speaker brad pitt voice . fight club feels like graphic novel -- very surreal fun look . but it not everyone . fincher great job . he could shined it up turned noise down but didn't . i highly recommend it !	1

political/histories student studied rwandan genocide some detail , let me start just saying i impressed relatively historically accurate depictions various parties genocide(french , belgian , u.s. , u.n. , interahamwe , tutsi positions ) chronoglical events take place during movie itself . nick nolte portrayal u.n. colonel shackled bureaucracy politics ( instigated belgians who among few willing join u.n. mission but 10 peacekeepers murderered initial days genocide others withdrew support due domestic public opinion ) strikingly realistic appears draw obvious connections actions romeo dallaire who held similar post during u . . ' limited mandate rwanda events began unfold . unlike many contemporary movies which draw upon label " based true story " feature many embellishments , movie remains remarkably free dramatic flourishes or moral sermonising . person , i found it difficult not moved vivid portrayal horrors became known among worst atrocities human history ; 1 million killed less than 3 months - faster rate killing death than holocaust . indictment human indifference plight others , movie stands testament not just human suffering continues draw its historical roots european colonialism ( german belgian this instance ) but also remarkable stories survival which emerged subsequent killings . don cheadle unforgettable hotel manager who genocide brought into his home , work family chooses respond plight others around him ( hutu tutsi alike ); risking everything protect powerless voiceless . soundtrack equally brilliant ; incorporating african influences intermeshing perfectly into various scenes ( million voices ) . truly memorable touching , hotel rwanda provides insight into traditional contemporary attitude west towards africans . this perfectly captured two particular statements : one jack ( joaquin phoenix ) other colonel oliver ( nick nolte ) . it also triumphs role individual ; actions even one man help change world around him . never again	1

let me start saying first movie series absolutely fantastic . regardless fact it didn't stick few key plotlines book , everyone still great job adapting original jurassic park . then came this piece trash ... whereas first movie least attempted loosely base itself book , this one just takes brilliant writing michael chrichton throws it directly out window . first off , john hammond supposed dead . he dies end first novel . secondly ian malcome supposedly dead , or least mia end first book , we join him costarican hospital opening 2nd . there no bratty daughter , entire premise much more it . most importantly ... entire ending san diego t-rex ... which possibly worst conceived plot line history movies ... not exist book ! i went into this movie expecting tightly woven plot , huge concentration conspiracy such island exist , anticipation some good dino-scenes top it off . what i ended up getting writing equivalent monkey typewriter drooling page . not only ... but because lack plot , dino scenes complete over-kill . when you see so much it , you lose awe wonder first film . when you see brachiosaur first 20 mins original film , wonderment difficult rival . there no such moments this film . if you're looking quick fix decent looking dino fx , go nuts . however , if you're looking something more substantial actual plotline , flick off dvd player pick up book . oh one more thing ... don't go near 3rd movie . they didn't even book untrue . i can't imagine how much more long-winded rambling my review would one	-1

first , we need little truth-in-advertising here : these dvds not uncensored . " mostly uncensored " would more like it . fact , there one scene where racial " " word visually censored while same time its verbal use not . while this explained away limitation production process , it just odd makes you wonder if scene wouldn't worked better if it censored altogether . additionally , some first episodes this season almost seemed written or improvised around fact cast knew their speech not going censored , so they set throwing expletives around dizzying display adolescent-like freedom . use profanity not offensive itself , but sophomoric atmosphere it creates way below talents these gifted comic actors . taken whole , this second season downplays its parody cops which writers successfully delivered us season one . it still there , sure , but here we find ourselves more entrenched familiar arena sketch comedy . it takes ball awhile get truly rolling , first i beginning feel disappointed think i going disappointed time i got season end . but , fear not , because especially thanks efforts bad-guy minor characters , lieutenant dangle crew definitely leave us laughing . season ending double-episode works just well any other sitcom-classic season end , it we treated cameo appearances martin mull , wayne brady some missing minor characters season one we witness comedic display who " meet new boss , same old boss . " all all , just season one , these people who just fun . these season two disks highly recommended all students comedy , well others who just need good laugh . niecy nash charm thomas lennon gum-chewing , dead-pan delivery worth price admission all themselves . if you ever go " traffic school " because you've received traffic ticket , i'll bet you " stick time " you'll never class like ones administered deputies reno911 . season one , there no laugh track , bonus material commentary thrown well	1

it amazes me how something like b-boyin ' so inventive , exhilerating , positive could only mainstream media less than 2 years ( circa 1983-1985 ) but fad like gangster ( so negative ) , mainstream media nearly 15 years ! ( nwa introduced it late 80 . it sad see hip hop turned into very thing it swore diminish .	1
i'm way too young known watched these shows growing up ( probably wrong part world ) , but i certainly enjoyed these episodes . even though complete series would preferable , i think episodes work all right their own . who says disney won't release rest further treasures sets ?	1

this wonderful , humble , simple film so very compassionate , loving sincere you may wonder , " how this possible ? " how it someone ' 90 could dare make film devoid irony , sarcasm or bitterness ? it seems miracle kurosawa allowed make film which , it main point , human kindness love . this film makes me wish i better person . it makes me think mortality one legacy , it makes me think people i love . good old kurosawa ... always urging us make difficult choices live better , truer , more socially responsible lives . see if you don't watch this film , then call your mother , or check your brother or sister , or reconnect old friend . it kind film shows you how precious our human relationships , what gift this life .	1
" winnie pooh abc " original winnie pooh story designed teach rhyming , words letters . rather than straight , rote learning , this presented form half-hour adventure . things all get started when christopher robin introduces pooh book rhymes characters hundred acre woods . christopher robin lets pooh borrow book soon pooh all his friends learning rhymes , words , reading alphabet , some help wise old owl . one major complaints this movie seems it only introduces few letters . if this concern you or your child , then i recommend making sure you get dvd version not video . it wonderful special feature goes through alphabet thoroughly , characters teach each letter both upper lower-case associated words . adults probably get bored this pretty quickly , but it'll dead useful your kid(s ) . there also abc song scenes " new adventures winnie pooh " that quite worthwhile . overall , if you want your kids learn alphabet , or just wanna see good pooh story , i'd say you can't go wrong this , especially if you get dvd version . also included dvd version fast-play option previews movies such " mulan ii " " pooh heffalump movie , " well original trailer both this 123s video / dvd . there anything else i wanted say ? oh , bother . think , think , think ..	1

since " ringu " japanese horror movies all rage here us , but mind you , not all them actually any good , what works japanese audiences not necessarily translate well american moviegoers . reason hollywood studios occasionally remake japanese horror hits give them western feel , case " ring . " same happened " grudge , " movie whose original played very well japan . unlike " ring " which hwas completely westernized , " grudge " columbia pictures took more restrained route . hiring same director who created original film , leaving its location tokyo cast consisting mostly japanese actors , filmmakers added only few hollywood actors create american feel . i curious find out if they succeeded well " ring " . i found " grudge " thoroughly enjoyable tense film hat kept me edge throughout . sinister undertones film , sound effects , strong visuals course stingers , all make first rate horror film , much better than most hollywood fare recent years , though you open somewhat different eastern sensibilities film plays upon .	1
well i just finished book christine last week . i determined find movie . after searching last week , i finally bout it . i seen it few years ago when i 10 or 11 . somehow i remember it much better . but nonetheless , it great . i few problems though . generally i dont mind things rearranged or changed , but they cut out wayyy too much , completly changed ending . they practically swtiched roland lebays role george lebays role , but only partically , i quite confused when i got scene . they also completely cut out lebay possession sub-plot , thus changing arnies character . i dissapointed micheal cunninghams role this movie , first off , he didnt look like thing like i pictured him , his whole sub-plot arnie dennis completely cut , he only 10 lines entire movie . biggest dissapointment me cutting dennis/leigh subplot . ending changed totally , also disappointment . however , i like rearranging certain things , it helps flow movie much better , actors arnie dennis perfect , too bad dennis role minimized much it . effects amazing ! even now , i cant imagine them any better , this if way back 83 . music wonderful perfectly fitting , regina cunningham just i imagined her , her role isnt cut down too much though . overall , i stil recommened movie , one better movies based stephen king novel , i only say read novel first . btw , their 20 deleted scenes i am go check out right now , therefore , their should good chunck missing footage it	1
it 1961 ; ussr finally finished its nuclear powered submarine ready deploy it off east coast united states purpose ... brinksmanship ? but hold , there problem ; soviet union staffed incompetents !! (one communism most odious flaws it not inspire common man excel ) . menacing black submarine doomed get-go . it leaks , it cobbled together substandard parts . after heading out sea , there problem nuclear reactor several men must go repairs wearing only chemical suits because warehouse out radiation suits . men receive lethal doses radiation , but unfortunately doctor doesn't know anything radiation sickness ... he only giving them aspirin . before long radiation begins permeate ship . entire crew danger . officers two minds - some want save crew expense letting submarine fall into hands americans , while others want save face soviet union even if it means lot men fall sick or die . submarine becomes more more disabled , men stumble reactor room vomitting shaking , commanding officer repeatedly refuses help nearby american destroyer , submarines food supply deemed too contaminated eat , dread crew really palpable . this movie very suspenseful because i no idea how it would end . definitely worth your time	1
i never saw this movie until i 16 . girl i dating time loved this movie . rocky horror picture show number one her list so i tend compare this one one not storys similar any way . but they one thing common they both horrible movies . i give this movie two stars because it some slightly entertaining moments , well so fraggle rock ! fraggle rock got cancelled reason ! everyone burn your copies now	1
really interesting dvd . i couldn't believe nbc news put this out ... but then again i'm not surprised because terrific storytelling .	1
how they it ? how jay ward his crew create perfect combination self-conscious silliness , cold war parody , bad puns , iconic artwork ? why no one since able rise level literate goofiness ? bullwinkle corner , aesop son , fractured fairy tales , mr. peabody insane rewriting history still huge fun . half fun , though , knowing original stories seeing how they got twisted into these bits amusement . yes , i admit nostaligic favoritism towards these relics my childhood . despite , there really lot here adult willing amused . go ahead - amused ! //wiredweir	1
i knew i trouble four brothers when i saw josh howard ( sports night fame ) scowling hard , trying tough detroit cop . not believable nanosecond . then it got worse when marky mark said , " why don't you two cops get some doughnuts coffee ? " rest film veers kind lame clich�d rhythm . almost every scene this thing howler . watching it , i remembered i hadn't forgiven tyrese gibson travesty 2 fast 2 furious . still , tyrese better than garrett hedlund , who looks like he refugee outsiders . but movie not total wash ; after all , it got great soundtrack	-1

if you loved back future trilogy , generally speaking , time traveling extravaganzas silver screen ... simply forget buying this dvd . all well it would make you feel like total idiot first half movie , while you try figure out all " time-traveling science " you've taught so far , then space you out close end , leaving you totally speechless . this not good , simply because producers writers probably went crazy themselves trying emulate real time-traveling pros , while winding up some abrubt , nonsense end movie , absolutely no sci-fi logic all : they simply eventually stop shooting , so they just thought any happy ending would trick , no matter time differences numberless loose ends still untied plot . not sci-fi movie not romantic story either : look elsewhere any these two types movie	-1
i never bought vhs tape , but when i notified this would coming out dvd , i ordered it . while i'm not amateur , i am professional , eric guitarist guitarist . anyone who thinks he don't need learnin ' fool only famous his own little world , small it may . i'm not arrogant . danny gatton known humbler , eric johnson could rightly called inspiration . what he not so much difficult it epitome finesse transparency technique . after viewing this , you understand what i mean . i already know much what eric teaches this session , what it , private session ( much like you might get git ) , master top his craft . but there always something learn even after repeated viewings . i even scanned booklet comes this so i break lessons down blow up individual charts more easy reading . if you serious improving player , if you're looking real professional , you need get this , if only see what true professionalism looks sounds like . lessons clear focused . booklet new ability slow down examples , you really learn play these things . but don't expect sound like eric ( just those who tried , but could never sound like jimi hendrix ) . you different so always sound different , that plus . but techniques all included here part " must learn " program you need create follow if you want least make good living playing music . learn master melody technique , where technique doesn't get way melody , but lives service song -- way it should . i teach , too . i recommend any student who wants grow they should get this dvd . if you get no other , this would serve whatever style you choose pursue , ultimately , because there so much here applied virtually any style , whether it jazz , country , blues , rock or even acoustic ( which i wish he would included segment , my only kvetch )	1
this isn't type movie make you reflect question your life ambitions , it designed make you laugh . i think it succeeds admirably . molly ringwald perfect budding teenager ready life meet her full-force . she surrounded quirky , forgetful family ( complete jerk younger brother ) , nerdy boys desperate her attention , good friends whom she herself , ( naturally ) love interest . anthony michael hall character funny dorky kid i've ever seen ... his dance moves legendary ! he several monologues still bring out genuine laughs me , even after all these years watching this classic . this teen movie , so go your expectations level you may pleasantly surprised you enjoy watching this movie years come	1
i bought this dvd my third-grade twins who difficulty memorizing math facts , don't quite understand relation these math facts real world . i thought this dvd would perfect , explaining basic math facts humor real life examples . but their explanations way over heads this age group . explaining concept " carrying over " while adding , instance , here what said written out screen : " carrying over means you take digit tensplace digit place sum , carry over digit next digit place left your addition problem . you this whenever sum amount digit place greater than nine . " yeah , * i * get it , but it not simplest way present it elementary grade child . i'm not certain what grade level this series -- perhaps middle school above ? -- but definitely not those just starting out	1
i loved series watched reruns all time . my sister also loves it she watches it over over . she downsyndrome once she latches onto something she likes she watch over over again . can't wait more seasons come ou t.t he only thing i not like how they put series together - you hit play each show . i other series you play all or indiduals shows . this first season it even show diagnosis murder shot off - jake fat man . i forgot it good see it .	1
i , like others who wrote before me , am thrilled finally see diagnosis murder dvd . please put other seasons dvd soon possible !!!! it one best shows ever developed . think it --- dick van dyke creators geniuses their day . they pre-cursors all csi shows others like it . they forensics solved murders , but much less gruesome way . diagnosis murder g-rated show solves crimes thought provoking way , without showing all blood guts all csi other shows . you actually sleep after watching show . dick van dyke cast like huge family ( no pun intended since his son barry lead role ) camaraderie comes through make very enjoyable family friendly show . young old , cool nerdy , single or married , people all walks life enjoy this wonderful show . amazon , if you could pass all positive feedback producers , so they see how much people desperately want other seasons dvd , i think i speak all fans show when i say , " we'd greatly appreciate it ! " readers , buy this dvd you won't disappointed . show awesome	1
" munich " not one steven spielberg best films , but it still worth watching due mainly brilliant cast . eric bana , geoffrey rush , daniel craig especially outstanding . film also impressive physical production haunting john williams score . but there problems . one thing , it too long . seems problem many directors today . why all today big movies run nearly three hours ? spielberg could cut half hour , film would much better . but biggest problem spielberg , kushner , roth really stacked deck israel here . story entirely one-sided . there excellent scene where araband israeli agents confront each other , three filmmakers would wise pursue angle . instead , no explanation given arabs'side or why they seized athletes first place . result decidedly unbalalnced story . ending ambiguous . still , " munich " ambitious film worth watching	1

months , disney advertised this 2-disc special edition dvd . but last minute , second disc mysteriously disappeared . why ? this false advertising , if i my way , disney would big fat lawsuit their hands . it unfair force people who really want 2-disc pay very expensive import prices get one uk those us who don't own region-free player . they this same crap alice wonderland , but other way around . uk lost disc we , paramount fox this us fans titanic dropping 2-and-4-disc editions us , but not uk , giving fans us 3-disc edition . i don't understand why these movie companies can't consistent their international releases simply make single version available all people all over world . unfortunately , i chosen not buy this crappy excuse " special edition " dvd . i not appreciate lied . i still love disney movies well excellent dvd editions , when disney actually releases product they've advertised months , i continue buy quality dvd releases , but i not enjoy false advertisement	-1

not only this arguably best docudrama ever made , it damn fun watch , george . scott brings legendery commander european theater operations life mesmerizing performance . fact , i think it pretty hard imagine patton without scott bearing , he quickly became synonymous role , even though he turned down oscar equally legendary declining speech given american indian woman 1970 academy awards . film doesn't so much chart patton life it make him captivating symbol american hubris . old blood guts considered many america greatest war hero , schaffner puts patton grand stage . we see patton his most combative , his powerful oratory skills which many ways voiced american foreign policy , even political leaders soft pedaled it . while movie definitely not political tract , it these undercurrents well worth watching again , especially time when we see so much bluster harsh rhetoric coming out white house . dvd package may not meet some persons high definition standards , but movie digital enhanced there plenty extras . you won't disappointed	1
i cannot believe how many negative reviews this film actually received . they watching same movie i watching ? i generally concider myself very critical when it comes political thrillers such " sentinel " , so i am not going just generally give such movie one my favorite genres high rating automatically without giving it some fore-thought . " sentinel " everything intense , well-crafted political thriller should . acting quite convincing suspense riveting . i guarantee you pinned edge your seat through entire film then some . also , scenario extremely plausible , especially today world , all militant groups out there -- neo-nazis islamic radicals -- who would stop nothing make assination attempt or terrorist attack against president or some u.s. institution . my advice , before listening negative rants other reviewers this film , go ahead take look it yourself . it safe bet you not disappointed .	1

many say books always far better then movies . i agree this . i read whole entire series ; anne green gables rilla ingleside . i devoured every single one , enjoyed all characters sad when i finished reading them . but i say movie very , very good ! megan follows superb job portraying anne , jonathan crombie so good gilbert . every single actor beautiful job made their personalities come alive . i heard myself say , " they shouldnt made movie book , they ruined everything doing so . " but when i watch anne green gables , i say this differen t.t hey only brought more story different way . anne avonlea continuation story , i loved one just much . i say though , anne green gables continuing story disapointed me very much . they changed plot , characters still what you loved but joy you usually felt when you watched first two isn't felt when you watch this one . it so different book it made me mad . part i like it though , when anne gilbert get married , its bittersweet yet lovely part movie . end when anne finally finds gilbert , its beautiful moment too . so my opinion this : buy anne green gables , anne avonlea , story told beautiful way . but only rent anne green gables continuing story , don't buy it	1

i heard it said norman maclean classic novella " river runs through it " finest piece american literature ever written . i don't understand how things like literature ranked such simple terms . i say , however , it one my personal favorites . spare , poetic spellbinding . perhaps one reasons i love this novella so because i grew up farm near rocky mountains , spent so much time when i younger fishing tracking through wood field . maclean tale speaks me my youth authentic familiar terms . i generally approach cinematic adaptations literature , particularly literature which i hold such high esteem , certain amount reluctance , even dread . who could possibly capture beautiful , simple craftmanship maclean profound prose celluloid ? evidently , robert redford . he it grace apparent ease . many maclean efficeintly magnificent words provided through narration . while i generally find device voiceover narration distasteful ( primarily because it so often used " coach " viewer ) , this case , viewer drawn into ( eased out ) macleans world macleans own prose , nothing could more appropriate or satisfying . also , cinematography nothing short spectacular , capturing magnificent , rugged expanse montana " big sky " wilderness one moment , golden intimacy afternoon river next . i dare say redford captured essence maclean abiding love his childhood wilderness this film , we , viewers , richer it . river runs through it close perfection i seen translating beloved work letters onto cinematic screen . it its flaws ? i'm sure it , there other reviews here point them out you if you care . my part , i wish only say this story love , crafted maclean love , now adapted screen redford care speaks love - love subject matter written words . macleans last words novella ( movie ) " i am haunted waters . " thanks his words , redfords faithful adaptation them , i too am haunted	1

" charlie chaplin marathon " inexpensive way seeing variety silent comedies chaplin . it includes versions trio chaplin two-reelers down mutual , including what arguably best this shorts , film distinction first attempt full-length comedy ( albeit not chaplin ): " rink " ( released december 4 , 1916 ) , eighth mutual comedy , based karno company sketch called " skating " written charlie brother , syd chaplin . chaplin often inspired business serving food here he ends up waiter who ends up rollers kating rink trying keep upright . course , if you already seen " modern times " you know chaplin virtuoso wheels when it comes roller skating . this time around edna purviance girl , while eric campell one her admirers , mr. stout , henry bergman plays both mrs. stout angry diner ( you imagine what charlie make diner angry ) . terms slapstick , " rink " most creative mutual two-reelers . " immigrant " ( released june 17 , 1917 ) best chaplin shorts far i am concerned . chaplin filmed 24 hours footage over two months produce 21-minute film when most two-reelers shot two days . when chaplin began , filming restaurant scene ( campbell head waiter ) , film going bohemian life , but scene too short he decided make tramp young girl immigrants , creating opening sequence boat happy ending . starting simple gag tramp leaning over ship railing turning out something other than what we think , " immigrant " classic chaplin , mixing comedy , romance , pathos . " tillie punctured romance " ( released november 14 , 1914 ) notable film not because presence chaplin , who essentially out character playing heartless sharper instead loveable tramp , but it product max sennet desire produce first feature-length comedy film history . sennett signed famous stage comedienne marie dressler film version her big success , " tillie nightmare . " massive legal entanglement resulted film sold arco $ 100,000 released " tillie punctured romance " whole bunch different lengths different soundtracks . essentially this burlesque burlesque which city slicker ( chaplin ) leads pretty country heiress ( dressler ) astray . sennett throws every trick he knows into directing this 1914 film anyone familiar work chaplin or dressler after this point dismayed their performances here . chaplin extremely deadpan dressler overly mannered ( way too much makeup ) . fortunately even his facial hair different enough us convince ourselves this not tramp therefore not real chaplin .

these short films starring w.c. fields , their own right , classic comedies . uneven , some pointed out , but classic their own right . i believe problem some people fields ' sense humor it too dark and/or too adult them . fields spokesman common man , especially during depression . his comedy subversive sneaky . his complaining voice recognized voice ordinary guy under thumb everyone everything his wife mother-in-law , dogs children , rulers land very business he . kid i not " get " fields all . i didn't understand what he doing , i didn't think he funny . i much preferred laurel hardy ( whom i still adore ) charlie chase whose humor more obvious accessible me . i annoyed fields ' whining complaining , didn't get sarcastic asides , just not like him all . i grew older i began understand what it fields doing . he original , pioneer . late sam kinnison larry david seinfeld , there isn't comic writer or performer who doesn't owe something w.c. fields . all bitching moaning you hear , especially stand-ups , nothing more than fields brought into modern era . he ( mark twain before him ) spawned sly sarcastic wit american comic dialogue long before it commonly accepted or widely appreciated . make no mistake : fields ' humor masks real pain . what we hear his whiny voice suffering man who can't catch break save himself . he championing all losers , little guys , nobodies , if it sounds bitter times , well ... it . i agree some other reviewers here when they say one must grow up go through certain amount real-life experiences before fields truly grasped ultimately - if you're lucky - embraced . otherwise you better off three stooges marx brothers . their worlds completely unreal whereas fields ' world all too real . it place escape * * not into , what you hear fields ' beaten-down characters sound man dragged through knothole backwards . ekw	1
not bad , though it fairly predictable . high school kid ( chris makepeace ) enters chicago public school , coming well-to-do academy . right away he comes up against gang extortionists ( led matt dillon ); they threaten him , but he refuses pay . instead he befriends toughest kid school , loner , who agrees become his bodyguard . this kid ( adam baldwin ) legend grow around him ( raped teachers , killed people ); what he really guilty , however , accidentally shooting his brother , which he unable confront . but through his friendship makepeace , baldwin comes out his shell climactic finale involving fight extortionists . it teenage feel-good movie , funny times pretty accurate age group - but there something amateurish it , too , more flavor made-for-tv movie than hollywood production . adults don't matter , which great ; even ruth gordon old lady lush routine here just comic asides . it pretty good movie , though , worth watch	1

more i watch this well loved , intimate , unique film , more i love appreciate it . people , you missing out unique piece american culture if you neglect this gem . not only acting so astounding , actors so naturalistic which so indicative 70 ( me , so sorely missed . not sound dowdy but so much today ;s acting merely posing pouting trying look all-important-sexy-at-all-costs ) story simple human , broken marriage , woman who finds her core ... but told so beautifully , background city , city , city which me also actress film , our new york ... also major plus dvd commentary paul mazursky jill clayburgh . they such insight warmth interesting commentary , not just making film but art acting life . me it worth it hear these wonderful artists express their ideas memories . i admit , i love them both so much my life shaped this movie . it truly underrated underappreciated piece art . it art ! score divine too . if you think , after 1st viewing , maybe you dont like it , it too 70s or corny ,,, give it try . it truly whole little world you glimpsing , mr mazursky created magical place , i never never tire going there .	1
aaron russo very brave man his production this outspoken film . he should commended his efforts regardless some minor inaccuracies , such , " there no law . " income tax excise tax based exercise federal prerogative measured dollars produced exercise . this limits its scope federally priviledged activities such working post office , or public office federally connected geographic area , or military , but not private sector . research it yourself realize how far constraints constitution we gone . this incrementalism elitists gone too far must stopped through exposure activism . we must support all who fighting against this agenda , such , congressman ron paul who running president ; peter hendrickson , author " cracking code : fascinating truth income tax , " who fully engaged lawsuit irs ; tom cryer , attorney who fully researched income tax , also fully engaged battle irs regarding alleged tax evasion ( see his response through link we people website ) . there more true patriots out there than one might think .	1
this great movie . several reasons some guys questioning fact this movie too bloody . but here it noble purpose . ( this not sin city or reservoir dogs ) read gospels . our saviour didn't come here pleasure , or chatting herod , drink some wine , wonderful feasts marry beautiful girl ( some fools say he married mary magdalene)and eternally happy hollywood wants us believe . no . he came here redeem us . he came here show us how christian should face suffering above this , he came here show us real face father , our father love . seeing this movie seeing how much jesus loves us . meditation passion christ devotion devotions . lot conversions occurred after people started meditating these sufferings our lord . all saints meditated them profound devotion them . even more , they recommended this devotion order obtain real sanctity life , because real love ( only somebody willing suffer like this die you , really loves you ! ) attracts lovers . regarding accusations " antisemitism " , i just one recommendation . it not secret jews hate jesus his church . this movie only describes what really happened according gospels . sympathetic sanhedrin would lie . they wanted jesus dead that what mel shows us this movie . what wrong ??? but if you're christian you'll understand devil who doesn't want people watch this movie because jesus ' victory against him cross . buy this movie !!!!	1

latest trend horror address old idea : struggle characters against unidentifiable force always power over them . there nice tension available these kinds works , anxious rage against insurmountable powers . but when tension just become bland montage vague threats leave lack resolution disappointing rather than empathic ? pulse falls disappointing category -- there nice overtones problem overly technical world , but these highly unrealized , movie seems prefer pulling away any kind empathy rather than truly trying scare *** out audience letting them just enough really fear what they don't know .	-1
since george clooney his rat pack seem bringing back certain cachet italy lake como , it worth revisiting this picture-postcard pretty 1995 romantic comedy directed john irvin since it set there before onset wwii . lightweight plot focuses beautiful , elegant villa summer 1937 where miss bentley already spent sixteen summers her father . adored staff , she spends her first summer there after her father died , her first day , she immediately drawn polite but rather pompous major wilshaw . typical movie-only fashion , they meet repeatedly , awkwardly fractiously , particular , over tennis match where she defeats major ease front most enthusiastic group . there unavoidable but unspoken chemistry two , but further complications ensue arrival miss beaumont , young , flirtatious nanny wealthy italian family staying villa . miss beaumont manages convince wilshaw she loves him , he becomes instantly enamored . her side , miss bentley attracts attention much younger admirer named vittorio , local vespa-riding lothario intent seducing her amid his raging hormones . you imagine , complications sort themselves out , but clever way irvin screenwriter trevor bentham handle story , while patently old-fashioned , also charming sometimes quite perceptive how more mature people approach love . rare comedic turn immediately recalls kate hepburn circa 1955 " summertime " , vanessa redgrave redefines any preconceived image one would spinster , she brings buoyant energy blessed lack self-consciousness independent miss bentley . even though she makes no attempt assimilating into period her most contemporary look , she shows off deft skill romantic foreplay likely first time since she mod swinger 1960 movies like " morgan ! " . her athleticism also impressive whether tennis court or lake swimming backstroke , though her rather androgynous look wouldn't seem like it would attract not altogether unwelcome attentions horny italian boys . other points triangle not fully drawn . edward fox plays major stiff upper lip glowers appropriately every scene where he loses his dignity - which often . fresh off " pulp fiction " , uma thurman plays man-eating vamp broad strokes , her constant delight humiliating major gets tiresome . her beauty , however , inarguable wilshaw obsession understandable . there some intriguing casting sidelines - moony vittorio , alessandro gassman ( son actor vittorio gassman ) would play viral maniac " transporter 2 " decade later ; proprietress villa , signora fascioli , played alida valli mere 46 years after her seductive turn harry lime lover anna carol reed " third man " ( sadly coincidentally she passed away today ! ) . beauty lake como captured all its shimmering light cinematographer pasqualino de santis , nicola piovani music score provides right evocative flavor period . it sweet , entertaining movie , brief 91 minutes , definitely viewers fond travelogue movies like mike newell " enchanted april " audrey wells ' " under tuscan sun " . 2003 dvd no extras	1

few years after painful personal tragedy this gifted director , he decided materialize this sad love story wonderful photography , unforgettable soundtrack , astonishing cast slow paced but perfectly articulated script . all we know everlasting prejudices moral conventions not belong specific country , religious beliefs , or citizenship . these rules remain unconscious collective , if you just want supported evidence , go effie briest germany madame bovary france . these portraits not more than final result consequence inability get true culmination inside individual sphere triumph love couple , this failure its more important testimony king artur legend this seems remarkable point because this simply most important myth western world . this film meant endless beauty natasha kinski known . admirable highly recommended artwork .	1
word " patria " means homeland spanish ... sometimes , when we live land freedom , we forget what it means we forget how love it . this first movie i seen depicts harshness castro revolution way people understand . it provides concrete examples why it so horrible ... everything taking your property leave your family . it also briefly shows jails where so many political prisoners held years follow . it wasn't only those worked batista ... following years , thousands men women imprisoned their political views without due process . if time history cuba summed up 2 hours , andy garcia hit nail head best it could	1

this easily one worst movies i've ever seen mostly because it most unoriginal movie i've ever seen . most scenes ripping off stuff cannibal holocaust , zombie , or george romero " dead " movies ( sometimes even stealing lines night living dead ) , not mention entire soundtrack lifted dawn dead . course there also horrible overracting , inane storyline , but those pale comparision blatet unoriginality movie . now good : gore . if you're one those types check out horror movies see some sweet gore effects genuinely disgusted , then you might want see this movie because gore pretty top notch , especially facial dismemberment final scene . what it comes down you should really avoid this movie unless you're absolutely obsessed gore . if you really must see this movie , i recommend you buy it part " walking dead fright pack " anchor bay released because this movie you'll actually get some good ones like some lucio fulci later work criminally cheesey " dead heat .	1
this second season mission : impossible we see peter gravesintroduced head impossible missions force , roleof jim phelps , replacing steven hill dan briggs . dan briggscharacter more cerebral , jim phelps character more physical . both characters their supporters , although i tend preferjim phelps . it noteworthy i don't believe there anyother television series could replace its lead actor nothave it affect shows quality or popularity . this becausemi " plot driven " rather than " character driven " . indeed , two morecentral characters would leave after season 3 ( rollin cinammon ) andyet series would go several more seasons , indicatingthe outstanding quality plots , direction production . general , i feel overall quality series improved thesecond third seasons . there episodes first season thatare good any ever produced ( e.g. operation rogosz , carriers , frame well pilot episode ) , but there good numberof weaker stories . second season sees overall stronger effort . whereas first season still some 1960's-staple car chases , shootouts fist fights , these pretty much disappear second season emphasis outwitting enemy clever plots ingenious gadgets . especially noteworthy " trial fury " which especially intensestory , masterfully directed leonard horn who also equally intense " operationrogosz " , " photographer " great performance anthony zerbe who plays son convicted atomic scientist out revenge , unusual episode called " town " where jim drugged held prisonerby evil enemy agent played otherwise grandfatherly geer . seeing masterpiece television series like this made 40 years ago only make us lament dismal state art today	1

effective ghost story should air mystery it : why there ghost ? what purpose ghost haunting particular place or person ? modicum pathos also important truly emotional turn screw , ghost cannot only vindictive or vengeful , but must sadness it ; something we empathize make haunting all more tragic , well spooky . gore also must kept minimum , effective ghost story relies creating sustaining balanced mood tension . too much gore balance shifts into rapid moments revulsion anxiety , whereas good ghost story relies impression subtlety , implying more than actually shown . whispering corridors ghost story expertly balances social commentary regarding south korean girls ' school ( why ) , pathos duality ghost it moves normalcy ( daylight ) vengeance spirit ( night ) , symbolic use blood tell moving tale loss , redemption , continued loss . it opens our ghost prowling girl school grounds dark stormy night ( i know , but it dark stormy ) , ready exact vengeance teacher mistreated her . teacher discovered ghost secret , thus seals her fate . discovery murdered teacher cinematic style ; first showing face student she reacts seeing mrs. parks ' hanging body walkway , then showing back student she views body , her head blocking our view , finally , camera ' steps ' left student , show hanging body farground , back student foreground , side side . other student reactions then shown still shots they come upon body . muted colors throughout film lend stark , rather cold aspect events unfold girl school , putting more emphasis callous indifference mistreatment students their emotional needs . male teachers school come off chauvinistic condenscending all-girl classroom , become violent toward students little provocation . one teacher particular , mr. oh ( mad dog , students call him ) , his stick sarcastic unstable temperament , reminded me math teacher i suffered through one semester . he also carried stick whacked students little provocation . learning intimidation threat , whether south korean all-girls school , or north american all-boys school , not conducive true learning environment . it this restrictive , competitive , uncreative classroom environment our ghost born haunts day night ; day , one students attended class years without any teacher noticing her , night , vengeance spirit , murdering those teachers mistreated her any other girl . pathos brought into story ghost need normal , relive her classroom life again again hopes getting it right . she not want hurt anyone , but those annoyingly vindictive sadistic teachers keep mistreating students , thus bring vengeance spirit night , exact revenge . while vengeance ghost appears only three times film , each occurrence filled supernatural events build into violent attack bloodily carried out , but not gorily so . blood used symbolically here , not shock value , especially end , when classroom becomes inundated blood ghost finds release stops her haunting . i should point out there sequelization-antic ( aka ' not over yet folks ' ) used end film , but this case , it fits perfectly within logic story , serves heighten tragedy film social commentary focusing : how south korean girls school system repressive , demoralizing , , some , downright fatal . how sad this commentary also said our own school system	1

recent films covering lives and/or careers artists , basquiat among best . while spanning less than 10 years life this musician cum artists cum celebrity , it all one needs comprehend how this prodigy became overwhelmed fame fortune . juxtaposed against warhol , who profoundly understood dimensions celebrity , we see basquiat quite opposite -- naive point charming , overwhelmed times , utimately seduced all nefarious world which booze , drugs , sex all there taking . but this all seen before lives people such belushi , joplin , hendrix , slew others ; so much early death young star seems become almost archetype . yet it still intrigues us multiple reasons , , pointed out early movie , death artist seem mystify both work person . would basquiat nearly famous now , he cleaned up continued painting ? we might guess if case there would probably not movie him . this serves illuminate other burning questions indirectly offered film : basquiat really good artist , or he right place right time when new york art market eighties bullish way probably never seen again ? , schnabel canonizing basquiat into league mythical artist ? whatever answers may , i honestly say my interest thoroghly piqued , so i equally curious basquiat i his place time . perhaps it schnabel artist shines through much film , moreso than schabel writer/director . basquiat movie replete symbolism , both overt covert . give example each , narrative film enhanced several occasions sub-narrative surfing -- hopefully all you need know . otherwise , direction cinematography seems follow basquiat life career , where choppy editing eccentric montage play almost sub-character . it should noted many characters movie fact compounds various people throughout his life during this time . course , andy andy , rene rene , largely , his art dealers his dealers , but beyond his friends girlfriends movie generally cover multiple personages . end , tale basquiat tragic but compelling , it movie deserves multiple viewings , especially those interested art world , or who like good bio-pic . some fiction , some fact , but otherwise contextually acurate	1
i'm fan reality television even though contestants survivor big brother completely artificial situation , far reality . yet nobody writing their script ; they writing themselves . these comments also relevant this excellent documentary young bob dylan tour england 1965 . i don't like spotlight reviews this site . they too " expert " don't get everything right . they too full themselves . one main impressions i get this documentary concerns clash beautiful brilliant dylan , who actually doing something good world , reporters/critics . true , dylan very confrontational them , but they lucky his attention all . it seems like these nothings , these cogs wheels employ them , don't get point all . point hattie carroll , murdered rich apathetic white s.o.b. getting away it . point bob dylan coming out saying something needs said . point bob dylan believes right wrong , therefore mouthpiece god , cutting through all our crap . very few others doing this time . not too many doing it now either . put radio . what you hear ? you hear personal lyrics , i love you , i find you attractive , i'm mad you , whatever . one genre you hear you worthless except degree you turn me , singer worth more than you because he fancier car more expensive jewelry , blow you away shotgun . what bunch baloney . what kind values we offering young people who listen this idiocy think it cool ? then you dylan . justice . poetry . intelligence . how often you hear lyric radio intelligent ? contrast dylan this documentary some more recent dylans . you know song union sundown ? that one ripping globalization shreds , decade before everyone else realized it needed stopped , way maximize profits paying pennies labor , firing american workers replacing them slave labor overseas . contrast dylan this younger one . more modern one , older one , isn't physically beautiful anymore , isn't pixyish darling anymore , but he just target , just sharp penetrating . one highlights this video live performance beginning it all over now baby blue special request donovan . first , donovan sings perfectly nice song , then dylan sings freaking masterpiece . i like way dylan smiles he sings " yonder stands your orphan " . think line . your orphan ? means you dead , doesn't it . i like dylan smile he sings line , smile saying hey , listen lyric , get it ? it one really interesting lines it all over now , baby blue . albert hall , dylan alone his guitar harmonica , no band behind him , he mesmerizing world most elite audience , beatles among them . he doing it just himself , his brilliant self . i like most commentary . this one few videos where i played film second time listen whole commentary . it funny way one commentators gives all his reasons pleased hattie carroll cut off before its climactic ending thunderous applause , then other commentator , who obviously right , completely disagrees what we've listening , perfectly non-confrontational way , says one song should shown its entirety . far detracting effectiveness film , this song would made entire point film , dylan powerhouse . real people , worth watchin	1

it painful watch this one . day stunt doubles start doing your trademark fighting scenes , it time hang it up . i love his early movies . seagal looked bloated uncomfortable . everything , including opening credits , looked cheap , rushed disjointed . transition scenes rough choppy . only star this one computer geek whose brief appearance actually funny . can't recommend it , sorry	-1

this film should it all , it story great show woman , close friends greatest show men , noel coward . it large budget , potentially great leading lady , great costumes whole plethero original lawrence stage numbers , " poor jenny " particularly striking . but somehow none enough either utilise andrews her full potential nor tell story gertrude lawrence right amount truth razzmatazz . andrews largely blamed it failure time but this seems so wrong , essentially it problem script , gertie struggle alcohol only hinted . coward homosexuality completely glossed over gertie illness subsequent death 50 , cancer , not even eluded ! here lies problem i feel , how earth you set screen alight story sensational life if you only tell bits story you think audience tolerate ? you need let audience judge what they take they clearly hated this ! shame wasted opportunity	1
this great selection old scary movies . i love this series . phantom opera great , curse werewolf best lights off . these my two favorites this series .	1
when i heard year ago hal hartley quot ; unbelievable truthquot ; going out dvd 2001 , i feared some low quality production - but this release should prove worthy this masterpiece . picture 1.85 : 1 anamorphic hopefully image quality going excellent considering anchor bay good reputation ... directorial feature film debut acclaimed director hal hartley , film not long any big extras disc - audio commentary would illusory - but we get interview hal , theatrical trailer course . this definitely disc get all hal hartley fans , only thing could make me even happier would more dvd releases his movies : trust , simple men , amateur , flirt , his short films , etc ... i'm desperately waiting !	1
here one word sums up this film : beauty . plot " house flying daggers " ( original title : " shi mian mai fu " ) lacking , but way it made up intoxicating sets , costumes , exquisite love story . zhang yimou backs away grandeur " hero " favor more intimate story . it 859 a.d. , near end corrupt tang dynasty . guerilla rebellion called house flying daggers ( who able throw knives great distances ) sprung up against government . despite loss their leader , rebels thriving . deputy jin ( takeshi kaneshiro ) decides go undercover infiltrate house , he tries get trust blind courtesan mei ( zhang ziyi ) , daughter house dead leader . but soon he begins fall love mei , jeopardizing his loyalties , while mei herself experiencing confusion . but government officials want mei dead because her sympathies -- even worse , they don't realize jin undercover . make things worse , jin not only rival mei love -- his best friend well . director zhang yimou apparently said " hero " warm-up " house flying daggers . " it seem more polished fully realized , without " rashomon " storytelling . instead war movie , it mixture fairy-tale romance beauty , spies guerilla warfare . final half-hour stumbling block , where some plot threads come unravelled . things get pretty confusing . zhang doesn't drop ball far stylism goes -- color exquisite details every frame . they almost intoxicating effect , so action sequences . one most memorable scenes ziyi performing " echo game , " where she strikes drums particular rhythm her flowing clothing . not mention balletic , dreamlike fight bamboo forest , participants soaring dipping like cirque de soleil dancers . it all completely unreal , but there lies its beauty , like painting sky focuses sun not clouds . this entirely zhang ziyi picture -- since her debut " road home , " ziyi proved herself wonderful actress . " house flying daggers " focuses mostly ziyi , she gives truly exquisite performance , particularly when she pretends blind woman -- watch her face . two supporting actors , andy lau takeshi kaneshiro , solid job their roles , particularly kaneshiro , who brings plenty life what could cliched bad-cop-turned-lover . " house flying daggers " worth seeing just see -- it visual ecstacy packed around fairly typical love triangle plot slightly disappointing final half hour . but sights alone this intimate love story exquisite	1

this adaptation fairy tale " little red riding hood " not children.it got couple good transformations , not best i've seen but good nonetheless . i'd imagine kids would find this scary it not bad adults either . i doubt this film would made these days 80 able get away much more , unless great terry gilliam helm . i loved set designs , all little creatures way wolves used all very well done.as i said , not something i would show my 8 year old daughter fear it causing her nightmares but would definitely recommend this teens adults . good horror film those who don't need axe-wielding murderers able enjoy more fantasy right	1

this film loosely based upon robert ludlum book " bourne identity " . it not faithful adaptation nor it intended . book just springboard something little different . read book loved it , i also really enjoyed this movie . they both excellent . each forges its own path entertains its own way . plot simple , or so it seems . man found ocean two bullets his back . he rescued trawler italian fishermen . when he regains total consciousness , he no idea who he or what he doing caused him floating ocean condition which he . he shortly discovers his name jason bourne , it appears great many people trying kill him , though what purpose he no idea . jason bourne ( matt damon ) also discovers he some unusual gifts automatic , instinctive responses certain situations . it turns out he natural " bourne " killer ( pun intended ) . jason teams up german expatriate named maria ( franka potente ) , together they run into some heavy duty action , they run their lives . meanwhile , team cia trained assassins , dispatched bourne boss , cia honcho named conklin ( chris cooper ) , hot plucky couple trail . there number stunts action scenes guaranteed make one palms start sweat . matt damon , looking very buff , portrays bourne intelligent , resourceful character core goodness imbedded his assassin psyche . he simply terrific . franka potente good free spirited maria , who also resourceful jason love interest film , though , quite frankly , very few sparks fly them . chris cooper excellent bourne boss , conklin . he coldly efficient brutal his mop-up operation . unlike bourne , he lacks core goodness . this action packed , inventive , spy thriller hold viewer its thrall . this film revives genre film beginning get little stale . kudos damon giving viewer something fresh entertaining this genre . this film well worth one personal collection	1

this review regular edition dvd , not criterion one . dvd piece garbage . it claims widescreen , but it not . it encoded fullscreen dvd ratio letterboxes . not only this waste space , but it gives picture actually smaller resolution than it should dvd . i wouldn't surprised if they took panscan print chopped off top bottom , like back future box set fiasco . i comparing my friend copy he taped off tv see if it so	-1
i enjoyed agatha christie novels dvd - they restore television its primary mission : entertainment . this twisting plot no exception ! land irag , filled sun science archeology , expedition runs into trouble when murder rears its head . fortunately , indomitable poirot scene ! he unravels deep complexities murder(s ) , entangling alliances , takes axe root bitterness jealousy . all all , story thoroughly entertaining mystery unfolds marvelous way . like following breadcrumbs expected end , director leads us inexorably , but logically , conclusion . so , put fire , micro popcorn , sit back relax enjoy pure entertainment .... again	1

now i saw some reviews site some bad some go way far into plot . now adult i'm going rate this . pokemon first all show follows ash ketchum aboy who begins adventure catch train pokemon-creatures inhabit his world . it pretty much childrens show but movie really strong theme . it begins scientist funded giovonni , corupt mad man charge lethal organization . now scientists recovered fossil said remains legendary pokemon mew , also first one existence . cloning process successful but mewtwo soon discovered humans care nothign him rebelled against his creators . once giovonni betrayed him mewtwo adamant destroy humanity thining humans all same . doing he brings forth greatest trainers planet clones their pokemon . movie teaches greatest lesson learned- we all different but if you look past differences focus what we common then perhaps we so much more . good lesson hidden inside chaoticly famous series	1

epic telling epic historical events . feel extent roman slavery given scenes mines gladiatorial training centers horizon filled crosses end . one great themes this film integrity bravery some " lowliest " slaves reminding us it these qualities make us human not our station life . readiness rebels end stand up counted leader culmination theme ; ending scene still brings chills every time i see it . even such moving serious themes , however , film sprinkled places humor wit , especially slave-trader character mr. ustinov . deleted scenes , such one tony curtis bathhouse , build what only hinted original release making widespread treatment such slaves more apparent . some ways , i think i prefer hint rather than more direct portrayal but it still tasteful manner convey types abuse brought rebellion . gladiator fights battle scenes still some best ever made . i still enjoy them even more than more recent movie similar genre , " gladiator . " all actors portray spartacus since continue difficulty living up standard set gritty yet compassionate kirk douglas portrayal . his portrayal noble slave challenging innequities superpower churn memories similar times similar men women who chafed manacles slavery injustice throughout history . time time , it necessary challenge inconsistencies society considers itself enlightened yet continues oppress few deemed unimportant . thomas jefferson once said , " little rebellion now then ... medicine necessary sound health government .

entertaining double creature -- er , , double feature inspired tv tales crypt ( which itself inspired identically titled , delightfully decadent ec comics 1950s ) . first bill demon knight ( 1995 ) . surface , this one typical tale good-versus-evil , noble agent heaven working protect mankind evil demon who , help his minions , seeks throw veil darkness over universe oppress mankind process . trite , yes , but good script , talented cast ( including billy zane wonderfully smarmy demon ) , high production values raise this one notch or two above average morality play . weakest element film crypt-keeper wraparound , which too much tv show cheesy feel ( though it feature uncredited cameo john larroquette , whom hardcore genre fans know opening narrator 1974 original texas chain saw massacre ) . story proper drawn script originally written independently tv series -- which probably why it rises head shoulders above it -- many its elements read like homage george romero classic night living dead ( 1968 ) more than offspring series or comics inspired i t.t he second feature bordello blood ( 1996 ) . many fans critics panned this one bromidic therefore unworthy follow-up demon knight , while it true many story elements worn vampire-movie clich�s , film certainly delivers what tales crypt title promises genre fans . plot involves beautiful redheaded super-vampiress who manipulated smug , ingratiating christian evangelist into running vampire brothel serves lure society undesirables their doom . chris sarandon riotously chews scenery perverse proselytizer , snl alum dennis miller delivers lots laughs cynical pi hired locate teenage victim whoring vamps . film biggest fault probably gratuitous ta misogynistic undertones , but considering 50% mainstream film industry target audience horny teenage males , such elements hardly surprising . other words , bordello blood admittedly not high cinema , but there loads things keep genre fans interested , its overall tone more line tv show spawned it than its predecessor , demon knigh t.t he digital transfers both films clear crisp , while short extras , each film paired its original theatrical trailer . all all , this dvd duo well worth reasonable asking price	1
biopic french scuptress ( played isabelle adjani ) who showed great promise young woman then came under influence rodin ( she became his lover ) went mad . she contrasted her brother paul , who weak afraid life risks , while she strong , independent , willful ; he goes success while she achieves nothing but madness . rodin uses her , emotionally physically , when she becomes pregnant him wants him marry her , he refuses ( he actually living woman ) . she abortion , attempts again get rodin marry her , fails this - then slips into madness paranoia . she continues sculpt , one showing , but it not success she goes off deep end . she spends last 30 years her life asylum . movie good , mainly because script excellent ; so period photography . times it goes soft , though , especially some scenes rodin ( played well gerard depardieu ) where knockout punches should delivered . interesting , however , well worth watch	1

omagh film which shows us full cycles disaster .. we see characters before bomb , we see them during explosion , we see aftermath , then we see politics .. movie leaves unresolved bad taste mouth .. ever optomistic main character ( mcsorley ) announces media they finally begin moving forward .. but seems little consolation cover-up went government , ira , media .. we reminded some regards aftermath 9-11 .. politics media actually detract truth .. this film packs powerful puch gut should considered carefully .	1
clocking just under two hours , i love your work leaves viewer feeling though opening sequence stones tied your feet your body thrown into very deep dank water slowly settle into mud bottom . sound dreary ? then avoid this little mess film . it hard believe adrian butchart who giving us radiant goal ! dream begins trilogy could help write this script : one wonders if writer/director adam goldberg didn't just bring him help . story tired ( small time guy gives up love career movie star all accessories money , fame , celeb status , gorgeous wife , etc . only find life its simpler fashion preferable ) choices casting this very dark dreary tale inappropriate . giovanni ribisi , superb actor though he most assuredly , simply not credible movie star sex symbol whose stardom accompanied alcoholism , self hate , paranoia , fragmented thinking , bad decisions . only time we see anything vaguely suggestive his ability create role many flashback scenes ( girlfriend christina ricci ): his screen chemistry his famous wife mia ( enormously talented franka potente who here wasted mannequin role ) nil , his interplay such actors vince vaughn , marisa coughlan , judy greer , shalom harlow , joshua jackson , jason lee , elvis costello unilateral . goldberg films this boring redundant tale using all manner artsy camera tricks only serve make tedium increase . cast like this product promise . goldberg needs some time think this phase his career . grady harp , november 06	1

bandidas movie originally supposed get nationwide studio release , but never happened , so now moviegoers buy dvd surprisingly good movie . movie tells story sara , rich spoiled girl , maria , poor farmhand who lives her father . new york banking company arrives area trying acquire land bank rights hopes building railroad through mexico . process , sara father killed maria wounded . two women completely different backgrounds team up begin robbing those banks , sara revenge maria give land money back people . plot pretty simple , but this movie entertaining throughout . main reason most people pick this up because penelope cruz salma hayek western doesn't sound too shabby , they're right . both women incredibly gorgeous script gives them several chances show off their " talents . " but even more than , bandidas funny some pretty well-done action scenes keep your attention throughout . too few westerns released nowadays , so don't let this one slip . sharing top billing , cruz hayek play maria sara , two women opposite sides track who team up rob banks . mentioned , these women gorgeous , but they seem genuinely good time it shows final product . movie also gives them chance show off their comedic chops some fun action scenes movie fans might not seen before . steve zahn , lucky man he , costars quentin , crime scene analyst ( think 19th century csi ) who finds himself side bandidas while they fight over him . zahn very good part , steals some scenes his facial expressions alone . dwight yoakam plays jackson , lowly bank representative trying hunt down capture maria sara . small part , sam shepard takes part bill buck , grizzled old bank robber himself who teaches maria sara " rules " robbing bank . dvd offers good commentary stars hayek cruz , 5-minute featurette interviews duo making movie , theatrical trailer . so overall , don't scared away bandidas straigh t-t o-video release . it plenty action , humor , two gorgeous leading ladies . don't miss bandidas	1
i first saw orson welles artsy adaptation franz kafka masterpiece some twenty years ago . stark images this black white film stuck me ever since . very young anthony perkins ( he made this film couple years after psycho ) stars joseph ., ordinary insurance clerk who wakes up one morning find himself under arrest . despite his best efforts , . cannot find anyone who or tell him crime which he charged . after series distressing conversations , respectively , closed-mouth arresting authorities , his narrow-minded landlady his paranoid fellow boarder ( exotic dancer ) , he frantically searches throughout his unnamed city , progressively more disturbing encounters ( beautiful seductive young woman webbed fingers , mass children hysterically playing maze-like building , etc . ) . movie director makes appearance advocate who may or may not answers . ' questions . virtually everything this movie symbolic meaning -- every sideways glance , every slip tongue ( listen closely during unnerving initial interrogation where perkins nails two freudian slips one after other ) . much film set bombed out , abandoned railway station , which only adds viewer uneasiness . also much movie filmed dark , certainly symbolic movie theme . film score arrangement adagio albiononi concerto minor . its slow , dark sad melody fits tone movie perfectly . this not entertaining or ' feel good ' movie . it -- like classic novel upon which it based -- intriguing , horrifying unforgetable . orson welles believed this his finest film . it certainly most intellectually-satisfying horror film i've ever seen .	1

derek jarman ' sebastiane ' momentous painting which simply brushed film rather than canvas . this master work should any serious film buff cabinet . ( i should very much like see it running continuously upon smooth stone wall monumental pillared vestibule - perhaps like four seasons new york . it visual beauty should constantly view . not one element could added or deleted . if i may continue painting analogy , each stroke , whether finished or raw melds this work into composition which i think flawless . men beautiful , but tangible human manner . settings , whether diocletian startling lurid palace or rough bare terrain sardinia evoke both pagan christian motifs flawlessly . good evil ( all shades ) found both places ; irony world it always . homoerotic nature film vicseral , candid rather than overtly condescending - it might well set modrn iraq 21st century troops . i felt each character longings , whether god carnal flesh or human love companionship or spiritual other worldly deity . recognituion each these forms eros may entertwine meld genious . it everyman . it scrupulus portrait easily duplicit qualities beauty , deceipt , brutality even truth . powerful stuff .	1
those us who went through " josie grossie " stage , this movie welcome comedy , sort revenge nerds meets princess diaries . josie gellar ( drew barrymore ) , 25-year-old copy editor/reporter , never quite gotten over her traumatic high school years , replete bad hair days insensitive classmates . understandably , she mixed emotions when her boss , noticing how young she looks , decides josie go undercover give " sun " readers latest scoop high school life . so back fast times ridgemont high ... not only josie anxious this assignment , but she worried her personal life . 25 , josie never even kissed guy ( or rather , kissed guy) -- but she doesn't just want kiss any guy , but someone really special . while researching this high school expose , josie painful flashbacks she witnesses how kids treat each other . ( woman pretty drew barrymore would willing look bad she possibly sheer dedication her art ! ) through her brother influence popular kids ( he earns coolness points local baseball phenomenon ) , josie gets inducted alpha crowd unwittingly slights her " uncool " ( second-time around ) high school friends . josie enjoys her english class surprises her teacher , uber-handsome sam coulson , her love words knowledge subject . meanwhile , sun eavesdrops josie her high school adventures . sam ( michael vartan ) , noplussed josie maturity yet apparent youth . when he learns josie undercover reporter , he becomes hurt angry . josie tries apologize through very tabloid brought her trouble -- readers anxiously await see if sam meet josie baseball stadium deliver her first kiss before appointed time . ( let me interject my own two cents here : michael vartan hot ... he my ideal body type , sigh ... i writhing jealousy during kissing scene ! )this movie hilarious well-written . it accused formulaic , but so what ? it good message very funny . my friends i never tire watching this movie , expression , " josie grossie " taken life its own . when we show pictures our childhood each other , we often qualify them , " this picture taken my josie grosie years . " ( you know , glasses , braces , bad hair , works ... ) or , even our grown-up years , we'll tell each other if we're feeling particularly josie grossie given day .	1
i thoroughly enjoyed animals would liked more info given them . movie pure entertainment wonderful color [ except coloring tiger black ] weird ! they leave off technical jargon - i want hear animals how some scenes shot - how actors played their parts etc . what rigors actors go through ? set making interesting oh , yeah , didn't they know anything horses ? definitely fun movie	1
i find it odd when reviewing reviews this film people seem either give it perfect or abysmal scores . dichotomy opinion probably direct result skill immense power leconte images , ( especially those his chosen actress affords us ) . leconte master quite possibly greatest living auteur currently making films . his movies often contain refreshing difficulty gives one hope images still mean something , film still worthy explicated , someone still cares enough think much without overly clever such coens anderson . i shouldn't say still . i should say , leconte different level than any who ever worked including kieslowski ( master images ) . i enjoy how leconte said although it his second period piece he approached film if nothing it , learning " ridicule " . i should point out i no problem " ridicule " fact it period piece great deal presentation , but i see what he meant . like i said , i enjoy statement , but i should also point out i'm jerk . binoche auteuil two my favorite actors this film shows them their virtuosic best . they deliver amazing performances truly passionate couple who both hold unconditional love other which itself contains ultimate trust decision character . possibly more auteuil binoche but sympathy generated his character fuels her equally sharing partner , making any difference negligible . there third character , neel , but he there only accentuate relationship other two . movie , quite simply unconditional love what it means love unconditionally . there subplot equal merits ( mainly concerning neel ) belief redemption , what it truly means believe redemption . short it consequences action through belief , more so out love than those moral ground or stance . some people not willing accept belief actions or should occur solely out sympathy . some people never allow themselves love unconditionally . some people not understand or even like this film . binoche deserves prize doesn't yet exist her most exquisite performance . leconte deserves recognition what he what he given us this film , certainly one best i ever seen .	1

great show series " masters horror " . this episode ellen ( bree turner ) driving through mountains when she accident . she goes check other car when she runs into psycho freak moonface ( john de santis ) . there subsequent babe chased through woods killer , but twist ; she trained survivalist who set up neat rambo-like booby traps forest . she finally taken obligatory house horrors . you tell there much this story than first meets eye . production value top notch , it looks great , even if it kind " friday 13th " knock-off . horror favorite angus scrimm here , this time he plays much more animated character than tall man . he guy knows what going explains it . really stand out feature woman ellen , who much stronger than usual scream-queen ; more like buffy vampire slayer . if there one complaint it this ; don coscarelli notorious his quirky horror fantasy " phantasm " , but there little quirky wit here , it just straight stalk slash slasher . other wise great entry wonderful series .	1

my grandmother introduced me danny kaye movies starting white christmas court jester . later i found movies like secret life walter mitty just funny . i hooked danny kaye actor/comedian . this not one his outrageously hilarious movies . it sad beautiful wonderful plotline . wonderful cast compliments danny kaye musical score fantastic -- very jazzy rag . louis armstrong duets danny kaye voice well trumpet ( coronet ) . my favorite song lullabye ragtime , though . they manage meld two different melodies perfectly . movie focuses life red nichol ( danny kaye ) small-town coronet player trying make it big music industry . he falls love gets married , but just he starting make it big-time his wife gets pregnant . they take baby road them long they but it no life child . eventually she sent boarding school where she contracts polio . red so overcome guilt he gives up everything he music industry help his daughter get well walk again . time she grown up able stand again she forgotten her father ever music industry . red wife all his old band buddies want him happy get back into music , but red keeps falling into depression punishing himself his daughter polio . it ends beautifully all his band buddies turning out hear him play his daughter walking towards him without her cane them dancing together . it makes me cry every time . i would highly recommend this anyone feel good , slice-of-life movie both it joyous highs rock-bottom lows .	1
i think i like this season much more than than season 2 . only thing time i truly find out sort fact they didn't format episodes chronilogical order . episode el viejo placed second disc ( i believe second disc ) which comes after episode showing how crockett lost his black car ( before he gets testerosa ) . all honest i believe episode accidently left out season 2 . but spite little minor detail i believe anyone who buys seasons 3 4 won't sorry .	1

i mark points off because weirdness nick bottom wife , but i don't really mind all much change scene ( although characters might better named things like lorenzo antonio , but i don't like quibble over these things . much . ) otherwise , it all very fun . rustic players my favorite part . michelle pfeiffer okay titania , but rupert everett better oberon . calista flockhart appropriately befuddled " painted maypole . " she appear tall ! other reviewer who posted eyebrow-raising range accents right . sheeeesh . actress who played ' ermia worst , but thankfully , cockney twang sort faded end movie . all all , very enjoyable	1

i first saw this when i like 6 years old . i remember renting this my mom cousin . like lot people , my mom no idea who david cronenberg . well , she known , i'm sure she would not let her 6 year old son watch flick . main thing i remember this guy getting his arm torn off baboon getting pulverised . those pretty gross scenes . however , i buy this recently , realized , yes it still gross , it not age extremely well . but , i must say , jeff goldblum pretty good . he bit too quirky first , but i figured they wanted him this geeky guy so when his fly-like abilities started kicking , it would show extreme opposite what his original character . this would also cause sympathy towards end even though he became , basically dick middle movie . i suggest buying this , especially cronenberg fans	1
love story all , great acting , great script , great music , great cinematography , great directing . i appreciate this film	1
i originally purchased this 2 dvd set 1959 lana turner /juanita moore second screen version which it includes . i captivated emotional storyline , especially juanita moore presence . highlight film mahalia jackson singing " trouble world . " after viewing 1959 version , i pleasently surprised find 1934 claudette colbert / louise beavers version included this set even more captivating . while basic plotline same , characters bit more down earth , therefore more relatable most people . there also better love story this version . it easy see why it acadamy award nominated best picture . both these films choose wonderful option dvd viewing . reason i docked it star , because i initialy found it difficult decipher which film which side dvd , since it written such tiny print around center ring , so i flip dvd first couple times i watched it , until i figured it out . course , could just me	1

whilst i find comedy greats series personally more enjoyable , you cant go past interviews like brando or welles . cavett somethingn naturally accessible because i think he very close " average " person this position . or rather , he makes it look way . brando interview astounding : he arrogant , genius , mad ? make up your own mind but you wont able turn it off ! welles comes across like no other alive today : he spent time greats , lived among them dont miss his anecdotes churchill . better than run mill rubbish tv today , i assure you . oh yes , groucho makes yet appearance . cant get enough him neither could cavett it seemed	1

grand-daddy all vampire movies - there may earlier ones , but murnau 1922 nosferatu one we all remember - still pretty effective . count orlok ( max schreck ) wants buy house bremen , na�ve ambitious real estate agent hutter travels his gloomy castle deal . while there hutter spills little blood ( those red marks his neck aren't , he believes , pesky mosquitoes ) , worse , he drops cameo portrait his `pure ' wife ellen (`nice neck ' ) under , er , robust nose contract-signing count . if you've seen any vampire movie made since then , there thousands them , you pretty much connect dots set-up end . nosferatu least frightening , yet most disturbing , movie i've seen . set against deserted barren landscapes cragged castles enveloping arches , populated characters who flow one extreme pose , shadowed freudian debris blistered imagination bram stoker , framed focused through expressionist lens german director f.w. murnau , nosferatu filmed nightmare . today standards acting broadly melodramatic resoundingly bad , ham upon ham . orlok , dracula character , taloned pointy-toothed grotesque . poor hutter bouncing halfwit . nobody nothing reflects reality this picture , least waking reality . honest , nosferatu didn't begin work me right away . i saw it years ago bad vhs tape wasn't very impressed . image print clean , many delicately tinted sequences ( original , i believe ) good commentary track . still , after first viewing i something close my original reaction . i watched it couple other times after , once commentary track , found acting increasingly less distracting images more insinuating disturbing . it certainly movie grows each viewing . highly recommended .	1

i bought this movie because manson it i appreciate his artistic ability . also , prior buying movie i read description thought plot sounded interesting . movie , though not terrible , not excel any criteria . acting seems forced , special effects poor , plot starts get repetitive uninteresting . manson , most stars , only movie very brief periods time . movie revolves around screwed up mother who retrieves her son his foster parents after 6 years . mother addicted drugs neglects her child while exposing him evil outside world . many scenes no relevance actual movie end movie there no apparent moral or lesson . if you want see " dark " movie such this one fantastic acting actual plot i would recommend requiem dream	1
i loved this movie just much first one which just much critics hated it . i don't know why i still read what they say because they led me astray way too many times . especially when it comes movie like this where i know before hand i probably like it . i loved fact they continued this movie damn near right after ending first one , i enjoyed graphic nature series . who cares special effects if story keeps you engaged all way through , least enough get over any possible crappy fx scenerios . if you want great special effects , but crappy plot , go watch van helsing . that one movie i consider terrible	1

early going , i thought choice four five stars . movie progressed , my rating dropped somewhere three four , so clearly first half movie better than second . ending so disappointing i drop my rating two stars . it polish man france who marries french girl but divorced her because he unable make love her . he returns poland without her , manages get rich , comes up plot get revenge his beloved dominique . problem this writing he loves her , so why he plotting revenge against her ? it senseless . ending utterly surreal . she should hate him what he her , but she smiling him . he looking her crying . he betrayed her cruel way . he doesn't right crying her . like hitler crying jews . he still position help her out , but he won't . it really pretty sickening . story becomes unclear enough it , without adding some fantasy scenes or memories wedding kiss . it left me angrily saying " what hell going ? " i really hate it when director becomes unclear plays audience . i don't find cute all . tell damn story tell it clearly . besides , ending sucks	1
before he batman , christian bale turned film world it ear his incredible performance this adaptation bret easton ellis ' controversial novel . bale stars wall street yuppie patrick bateman , who living good life indulgent 80 . night , bateman psychotic serial killer whose masterful routine coming apart seams . while it uneven moments , bale star making performance worth seeing american psycho alone . no one else could brought character patrick bateman life better than bale , rest cast , including reese witherspoon , justin theroux , josh lucas , jared leto , willem dafoe , chloe sevigny , samantha mathis ; great well supporting characters too obsessed themselves realize or care what patrick doing . spectacular satire showcase bale talents ; american psycho isn't quite classic , but it pretty close regardless	1

no doubt " world war " probably best documentary ever made second world war but since beginning i problems playing this dvd set various dvd players . i consider myself serious dvd collector trying keep every disc clean possible following every instruction avoid scratches dirt . i know very first dvds this series sold public problematic but i thought mine weren't . yet , almost three years purchase , 3 out 5 discs completely unplayable althought none them no noticeable scratch . needless say i tested them many computer dvds stand-alone players various brands without success . i not know if this problem related fact these only dual-layered double-sided discs ( dvd 18 ) i ever seen because vast majority dvds sold around single-sided single-layered ( dvd5 ) or single sided double-layered ( dvd9 ) none them brought me such headaches . i wasted us$ 99 , 99 something i expected last much much longer .	1
begin , i am not big fan cary grant , except his hitchcock movies , where he excellent . i enjoy him much katharine hepburn bringing up baby . he very good eagle hawk fredric march . he tolerable philadelphia story talk town . friend mine loaned me this dvd ; she just bought it . i wanted see what cary would this film , i wanted see him dress . start , movie slow boring , all jokes so lame not all funny . i also don't go films where man woman yell each other dislike each other , then some point realize it really love they feel each other . come ! i just can't understand sort romance situation . i felt cary showed " mean streak " he show some his films , romance situation this story . i rate this one star because it one those films you get bored right beginning it sort torture waiting it finally end . all while i kept saying , " let move , let end this thing , when he put dress ?... " but they dragged it out boring , corny jokes . part we wanted see , cary dress , very end not very much . overall , this film real disappointment letdown . only consolation i saw it free ; i didn't buy it or rent it . still , i wasted good time i could used more profitable enjoyable way . i would even enjoyed washing kitchen full dirty dishes more than watching this movie ! sum it up , very very boring dumb movie , not waste your time .	-1
volume 5 far my favorite volume my-hime series ! this volume explores not only main characters , but other hime well little more than previous ones . now hime must fight one , everyone struggles seem come surface plot grows darker . there none those annoying filler episodes either , so you won't need worry entertained ! if you pay attention , you catch certain hints dropped throughout volume further explored connected volume 6 .	1

i love , love , love this movie . every time i watch this movie i am enthralled great acting beautiful yet haunting music . this movie very little dialogue , however , it very memorable piece art . thandie newton plays woman who lost her husband cruel injustices her african country moves rome study medicine . she supports herself live maid pianist . very early movie we learn her employer fallen love her . when she laughs his advances he begs her let him prove his love her . she eventually tells him only way he prove his love free her husband his african prison . he realizes then she married but he made promise prove his love goes selling his art furniture free her husband . haunting beauty this film up close shots thandie newton face she expresses joy , sadness , fear remorse . she expresses all her emotions without speaking words draws audience inside her we experience her inner turmoil . she realizes what her employer doing her her husband she slowly begins realize she some feelings him . yet , because lack dialogue we never sure whether her feelings result her gratefulness or true desire . my only sore point ending this film leaves you hanging . you want beautiful african maid her white lovestruck employer together , but we not get american style finished ending . we left make our own interpretations . i am actually going purchase this movie soundtrack . that how wonderful i think it	1
yes , some acting bad . yes , story isn't plausible . yes , special effects should better . but , hey this movie . i gave it 4 stars because casper van dien movie . i like see him movies but i little disappointed because he didn't even his shirt off . ok , unless you casper van dien fan or movie fan you probably not enjoy this movie . but , if you realize it movie it some good acting it , you may just enjoy it	1
you tell this movie released 1998 because you still see new york twin towers standing , because groveling incantations " islam religion peace , " repeated often enough ( casting good guy arab cop , tony shalhoub ) offset any pc-incorrect image portraying islamofascist terrorism . measure how silly this movie appears rearview mirror 2006 all ghastly islamofascist atrocities since 9/11 first terrorist scene movie , where denzel washington fbi agent tries , via megaphone , talk terrorists down hostage situation . he succeeds getting terrorists let children exit bus . jihadis conscience -- now where we ever seen this actually happen - beslan ( 186 children killed) ? london ? madrid ? mumbai ? only old people start exit bus second appeal denzel bus blow up . after series bombings new york supermarkets , movie theaters , restaurants , etc ., pressure builds call u.s. army under martial law . bruce willis , army commander who take this task , warns time again this isn't proper role army , but then , one president advisors explains movie , if this just one those political things , " president wants appear presidential . " remember , this 1998 , though critics movie , such new yorker , refer willis character " fascist u.s. army general " , decision grant him martial law authority would , ahem , none other than bill clinton . movie slides little detail , however , make it look like willis , all his own , rounding up all able-bodied men muslim persuasion ( less draconian , way , than rounding up all japanese-americans west coast fdr , where threat less real imminent than this movie , but let not talk , either ; we're still 1998 , after all ) . course , cia comes its usual whipping hollywood , where cia agent annette bening kept crucial facts herself because she personal scores settle -- you see , she one who trained armed some these terrorists who now running amok . oh , yeah , sure , women-hating al-qaeda types would allow somebody like pretty annette train them ! but best nonsense comes end : denzel washington handful fbi agents rush into army combat hq somehow surround bruce willis pull their guns , saying he under arrest " violating constitution " ( hey , why aren't they arresting guy who ordered martial law , bill clinton ? ) . general clueless security detail also draws its guns , there mexican standoff . denzel , using same powers persuasion freed least kiddies islamofascist murder bus , appears succeeding talking army soldiers out using their guns protect willis . so willis accepts situation , allows himself arrested , credits roll we see all these army vehicles leaving brooklyn shame -- all it took bust " fascist " general . ta-dah ! so movie , heap literary license , proves least one point end : back 1990s , it didn't take much bill clinton wuss out avoid taking terrorists . meanwhile , some day , sooner or later , idea pre-emptive internment jihad-age muslim men defensive measure indeed catch , if not here , then perhaps france , netherlands , russia , israel -- it interesting see who goes first . because it not just newtonian laws physics decree every action there equal opposite reaction . when they sequel this preposterous movie new york sans world trade center , willis play part hero , whoever gets stuck fbi agent role fool . i give movie two stars instead one , because i would hate discourage making such sequel , two , because any movie annette bening it automatically gets extra star my book	1
man , some my all-time favorite skits this wonderful compilation here . some reason , monty python crew decided re-do skits , so instead their original form , skits slightly different sets costuming , but ( thankfully ) masterful dialogue not altered any way . i guess crew felt original skits weren't 100% true their vision , so they made few changes match their original intent . one many stand-outs dirty hungarian phrasebook , where poor hungarian man thinks he asking cigarettes when he says , " drop your panties sir william . " marriage counselor who flirts man wife because man sissy anything it . still accountant who wants liontamer , provided lions aren't much different anteaters . course you'd expect classics like dead parrot sketch , nudge , nudge , lumberjack song , last but not least upper-class twit-of-the-year , which happens appropriate finale . my personal favorite sketch expedition mt . kilamarjaro , where john cleese sees two everything unless he covers up one his eyes . i also get kick out sketch where people fall out high buildings . this movie here contains best writing some best comedians ever walk earth . it real treasure every sense word	1
this movie great . this movie " dark " feeling it . it reminds me " 50 " . it great deal motorcycle stunts , music very good . again music reminds me " 50 also . movie not real serious movie . it sort tongue cheek movie . michael pare , diane lane , amy madigan good it	1
director : denzel washingtoncast : denzel washington , derek luke , joy bryant , salli richardson , malcolm david kelley , cody hodges , leonard earl howze , novella nelson . running time : 120 minutesrated pg-13 violence , language mature thematic material involving child abuse . based true story , screenplay written eponymous hero his own book , " antwone fisher " heart study psychological disturbance , laced reasonable amounts hollywood sugar optimism human spirit . it peculiarly american medicine , swallowed less willingly some markets than others , which probably explains why criticism film often confused denzel washington directorial talents ( which generally good ) various workings his film plot , which argued . antwone fisher story starts navy , where after particularly vivid nightmare he slugs fellow shipmate , hauled up before captain . sent navy psychiatrist jerome davenport ( washington ) , he begins work out issues anger , it turns out , stem abused childhood which added guilt complex over dead friend . same time fisher ( played exceptionally well newcomer derek luke ) , struggles establish first adult romantic relationship inviting cheryl ( joy bryant ) . parallel plot thread , washington character , ever-reasonable dr. davenport , marital problems . due course we discover he things learn communicating too fisher catalyst his own change . fisher screenplay reached cameras somewhat circuitous route : after his stint navy little writing experience , he hired sony executive write his own story - process which apparently underwent over 40 drafts before it acceptable . most weaknesses film traced uncertainties he brings his new craft , although washington direction papers reasonably well over many cracks . most unconvincing elements those subplots revolve around main character . these include psychiatrist ironic domestic problems , well fisher tentative love life . one tempted see these narrative distractions rather manipulative bolt-on elements , leavening appeal central , harrowing , personal history . fisher - cheryl romance instance , while context necessarily clumsy , also ultimately gauche . once consummated , it left languish without further comment , if further exploration this side fisher maturing unnecessary . perhaps sensing this central weakness , fisher script introduces element into young african-american tortured life foster child . during flashbacks he deal ' slave-nation ' justifications mrs. tate ( novella nelson ) , suggesting link hurt individual presumably whole black race - reasoning which frankly unconvincing none too interesting . significantly , such issues given short shrift psychiatrist himself , soon disappear view . plus side central performance derek luke hero , perfectly judged acting job , neatly balances inner rage confusion - " i don't know what " - lack self-pity . washington role also well . given difficulty actor-director role , he applauded carrying off both so effectively without fuss , either front or behind camera . this washington directorial debut he admirable job painting thorough picture antwone even though film could benefited some tighter editing , it still film delivers all emotional goods . arguably most impressive thing this film casting luke who total unknown actor mere handful television credits his resume obviously washington knew he possessed right goods pull off role . despite its flaws , " antwone fisher " intriguing look into real life estranged , enigmatic individual ; it film stimulate heart make you wish small children didn't endure such horrors .	1

guy who gave three stars some good points . he quite justified his three star review . however , way i see it , this one few films ( battle sounds only one i think right off bat ) really attempts explore art scratching deliver it wide audience . it true many dj left out scratch , but i think overall goal achieved . first all , film extremely well made . it artful , excellent soundtrack , good flow it some excellent interviews . there many dj weren't included partially because it 92 minute film can't possibly encompass all influential scratch dj . i respect this film immensely due fact it really opening people eyes what art scratching all . i mean eddie def right when he talks burger king dj etc . image djing kind position that easily filled any dumbass turntables " fresh " sample ridiculous . i'll admit , this film introduced me scratching . i've scratching two years now it become my obsession . i thank this film introducing me artform . course i can't review this film point view veteran scratch dj , but i review it scratch dj . if you want learn more scratching , or if you already scratch , then i highly suggest this film or battle sounds . if no other reason , some interviews ( especially some left out final cut ) worth buying this movie .	1
french new wave justifiably famous cinema circles , schools , etc .. it still talked today . when they mention filmmakers came school filmmaking , they mention jean-luc godard , eric rohmer , francois truffault . rarely , if ever , they mention jacques rivette . when friend mine asked me my favorite french directors , i said robert bresson , jean-luc godard , jacques rivette . my friend said " rivette ? " jacques rivette films stand out any other french filmmaker his time . other french new wave filmmakers prolific , whereas rivette would make film every few years . rivette films generally very long ( most extreme example film out 1 , which runs 12 1/2 hours , his other films run average 3-4 hours ) , concern themselves artistic process . this 4 hour film ( slightly longer than most rivette films , but not longest ) , but it unfolds magisterially beautifully . i saw it theater ( intermission ) , i entralled . it one rivette best films , one really shows agony artistic creation . creating art long arduous process . kubrick compared his art , filmmaking , trying write war peace bumpy car ride , but when you've finished , it amazing feeling . its pacing very slow leisurely , but there isn't anything wrong . i didn't feel bored , i didn't feel film needed cut . it perfect way it . title translated " pretty nuisance " , those who curious . this film really captures . completely unrelated sidenote , i remember seeing this film 2 couples front me . women liked it , but men bored out their minds . one kept shifting his head back forth throughout whole thing . men probably just hoping get laid afterwards , so that why they went see it . you should really only see this film if you're committed art cinema person . luckily , i am . this one rivette best films , he filmmaker deserves better known .	1

ok , this movie hilarious . i saw it when it test-screened last year la . back then i thought it so funny totally original it would theatres . i guess big studio bought it but didn't put it out theatrically . it so clever sarcastic you remember it lot more than your normal popcorn studio comedy . first all , " asexual " photographers gunther gerd off hook . they dress identically these ridiculous outfits , one mute while other read his mind . they point out they're not gay , they only spoon . they're always fighting over who gonna inner or outer spoon . lol . movie this magazine editor who organizes photo shoot world greatest supermodels . jaime pressly so funny editor . she obsessed supermodels , their posters all over her room fantasizes supermodels want make her one them . main supermodel played brooke burns , bruce willis ' old girlfriend . i thought she'd just eye candy , but she funniest playing german supermodel . guys dig movie because hot supermodels bikinis like entire movie , but we like it because we get see these vain creatures killed off symbolic really funny ways . it really smart comedy .	1
i first found out this movie you tube . i watch montage all best parts set some gorgeous music . after those 5:15 minutes i sold ... i went straight amazon , read reviews promptly placed my order . next 10 days longest my life , when it finally arrived i tore it open i wasn't dissappointed !! keely hawes personal favourite james murray now definately new favourite !! i somewhat dissappointed first length film , because i am accustomed my great period dramas ( ie our mutual friend , wives daughters ) anything 4-8 hours long !! so 1 half hours seemed mere preview first . but second time round i admit story fit perfectly into time frame . all all wonderful movie , wil leave you warm , mushy feeling we know so well !! making featurette quite interesting , although always , not enough time time given stars show !!! my recommendation : buy it now !! its lovely addition your bbc library	1

this film robert bresson beautiful sad . made same ambience tone his ' au hazard bathasar ' but not exciting it . i don't know where you coming , but if you interested intimistic basically plotless cinema , found foreign ( old ) movies , bresson good choice . but if your reason making spiritual journey , or or widening your faith , then , you must warned . ' diary ... ' pure doubt . doubt main character , rural priest , doubt director . tone sadness experience watchibng this film what mostly impresses me . other than , what stays my mind end story following thoughts : ) story-teller ( bresson ) makes us reflect inutily believing god , or acting if god exists , if he exist , life present , my circumstance , reality , now , what i feel , cancer i suffer , pain i feel , so real , so more real than god love i want believe but i doubt . this impression this film communicating me . ) everybody cruel . this people don't even deserve my love them . how i love them . why should i different ? it would crazy . what would my argument sustained ( case young priest ) order prove these people wrong their believes their actions ? god , his mercy love ? they look me they despise me ! or they pity me like fool ! sad . so this not really story , it just depiction tormented soul , realization we so imperfect , so weak ( would bresson even say " sinful " ? ) , fool-on-the-moon lament . cry wasteland . what you when you hungry ? you eat food , or you cry it blame it hungry ? same god . there certain resemblance this film way great historian arnold toynbee depicts disintegrating societies : there sense drift , which people yield meaningless determinism , if their efforts not matter , if they no control over their lives . there sense guilt , self-loathing comes their moral abandon . drift guilt . these nouns apply well young priest parishioners . whole postmodern pandemonium .	1

when i first saw round midnight young man , i thought dale turner real jazz musician wondered what he made him avoid america , like roman polanski . that tribute good acting dexter gordon direction bertrand tavernier , who i understand swiss . tight close-ups 1959 blue note reverberate sweat reality . recently i chance watch this film tandem michael curtiz young man horn i saw some similarities way gordon photographed john alton shadows stripes across his handsome face , just juano hernandez given almost noir treatment earlier film , heated nightclubs where everyone wears cigarette out side their mouth smoke makes feverish patterns across whitewashed walls .. i wish dvd included some memories film makers , including some testimony tavernier see if he really studied earlier american jazz films or not . young french jazz buff grows close dale who then becomes his idol , shares acting duties film , just dale sweats out his addiction liquor but what he can't shake his love/hate affair new york city america whole . ambivalence factor young frenchman just can't understand ; it goes way over his head leaves him standing far shores love even banks east river . i suppose if this movie made usa this character ( francis ) would played woman ( like doris day ) young man weith horn , usa men aren't allowed give each other adoring looks francois gives dale this one . given time period ( 1986 ) perhaps part would offered robin givens or lisa bonet ? it we get incandescent lonette mckee her finest , singing beautifully too . film goes great lengths prove francis solidly heterosexual , pro-family , his parents cute little daughter . david rayfiel , who wrote this paean black-white relationships , years favorite screenwriter sydney pollack , also wrote amazing rape revenge picture lipstick . he true journeyman here he gave dexter gordon part should won him oscar .	1

three things save this dvd fom trashcan - one selection kqed-tv black white performances ( although whole show available vhs ) . two very interesting films band recording " summertime " studio cheap thrills album . three course janis . she shines . those who only know her visually still photos monterey pop film , you may find yourself surprised how very attractive she every way . still photos never her justice . unfortunately , beyond these three saving graces this hour long documentary lackluster , managing make this incredibly exciting period american rock roll just plain boring , social revolution which fed it . most band performances within documentary nothing short embarrassing , profoundly bad , bad guitar , bad bass , bad backing vocals , just sloppy timing . when this accompanied lifeless modern interviews band , it tough find pleasure this disc . it comes across , i'm sad say , grown men whining incessantly how nobody liked them everyone liked janis more . even though i've always regarded band live playing cheap thrills alternate evening performance which out there someplace cd brilliant , my opinion big brother abilities ( personal character ) shrunk mightily after watching 900 nights . all bands bad nights , bad recordings out there circulation - most airplane live recordings pretty scary , but nothing like what we here . one would look very hard performance clips made band sound worse . black cherry sour whipped cream found extras , where each band member asked how he heard janis ' death . peter albin james gurley responses bloodless shameful . honest perhaps , but show little class guys . remember you're part legendary band one reason one reason alone . if it wasn't one particular lady , no one would know your names . stop whining . get over it . you got fired because you pretty lousy band who couldn't keep time or play decent solos . cheap thrills album sounds like band , frankly	1

i wish there - rating system , i would rate this - 10 stars , only good thing this movie john digweed ( he shows up end movie 2 minutes ) bedrocks heaven scent . it such burden watch this whole movie , first all acting horrible waaaaaaay overdone ; pretentious word . acting like watching those kids candy commercials there all these skateboarders " extreme " sports figures doing tricks advertise candy product . then theres all these gay love scenes , which i found very unnecessary . if this movie shows what rave scene really , i feel sorry ravers , fortunately this not what raving all . this story shows corporate-underground ( hmmm those two words shouldnt together , should they ? well they this movie ) rave , you party planner sending e-mails all these yuppys let them know where party , then theres " going party " thing , wharehouse blah blah blah . trying look like real rave , but last i knew raves werent sponsored levis or starbucks !! then you all these horrible actors trying act like there all high ecstasy , they just over it , its like watching your granny trying act like she drunk . then theirs dj who act like their mixing grabbing records , putting them turntable cranking up crossfader , any dj knows its not simple . i'm not trying disrespect dj , i bet john digweed tiny part this movie because he probably got ditched club owner didnt pay him gig he needed money get back home . part movie this " raver-couple " who met each other like 2 days ago getting married , their " love " completely influenced after using ecstasy ( love drug ) dudes brother who complete pretentious nerd . raver dude all sudden kissing dude who supposed official rave massage guy !! i mean wtf ?!!! then his brother ( pret . nerd ) gets hold some , course he never any kind narcotics or substance before , he starts tripping turns into complete fool , he meets chick who supposed veteran raver she tries guide him around his trip , then party he invites everyone breakfest his house , course doesnt happen because he didnt really like people , he just happy . thank god theres end movie , end you get see digweed playing heaven scent , thats only good part movie it lasts like 2 minutes . oh i forgto mention " police bust " . police arrive party party organizer talks his way gets sngle cop leave without checking any paper work or permit party , then later copps arrive shut party down raid like fashion , but guess what ? no one gets arrested sound equipment doesnt get confiscated , cops just run warehouse run everybody out . course nature this movie wouldnt just let people go home stop filming this atrocity , nooooooooooooooooo , people go back warehouse , break police lock continue party where they left off . totally unreal . raver-couple chick see her boyfriend kissing massage guy runs bathroom cry , her boyfriend follows her tells her he not gay , course they get back together go back dancing , then when partys raver-couple dude sees massage guy tells him " i'm not gay " massage dude replies " nah , me neither " . i hope you got idea how bad movie this review , i got headache writing it .	-1
my father turned me this film when i 4 . he used play it me when he cooking dinner , listening music , studying , any time he needed some down time himself accordingly , needed me stay one place . ( chariots fire warriors worked well too . lol ) well , i am 25 now this film creepy , fascinating hypnotic it then . i add no more than my peers here , all except one giant bozo found this film good i . music also very powerful medium used weir films , this film no exception .	1
faith hathaway just graduated high school one week away going into army . she full hope life . robert willie ( man this movie based ) , his accomplice raped murdered her . she raped , stabbed 17 times , raped after she died . director this movie denied requests made faith mother , gave all attention only person who deserved die . where mercy faith ? where compassion faith ? where people protesting faith life ? finally where story mercy which denied faith ? what her suffering her family ? barely foot note this movie . ohh sister prejean discovered lie when it suits her case .	-1
i tried two discs amazon , neither one would play my sony ps3 . sony says there isn't problem their unit , so i'm guessing it case bad copies amazon	-1
i wanted give movie version end all wars 5 stars but ... there trend lately faith-based entertainment use elements such swearing " keep it real " . perhaps this effort reach broader audience . ... or out defiance what typical faith-based entertainment . but once you've read ernest gordon firsthand account ( published under few different names ) you proof same moving powerful story told without language . others concerned like we which words used - it basically word said repeatedly one character 13+ times row moment anger then one time shortly after character . there other words well but never god name used swearing ( which where we would've drawn line ) . other than , movie really gripping . there some tense scenes violence , but there many excellent performances actors . hope this review helpful	1
you wanna know what friendship respect all ? watch one my favorite dvd - dinner rush - make discovery . excellent film outstanding performances ; especially danny aiell	1
ok first , if you politicaly correct person who wants nothing offends any one , don " buy this movie !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! now if you except world full offending things laugh them best way deal them , come seat watch this wonderful , trashy satire violance way we become numb it what it . oh yes brothers sisters feel healing powers this tacky road race movie future where war no more only outlet our aggresion sport " deathrace " where besides speed you must earn points running over people race way . david carridine frankenstien worlds greatest driver sport , but he begining think maybe this race no longer what world needs . all kidding aside(sorry if i sounded like preacher , but really i ment ) this satire very funny reminds us politicaly correctness isn't great if it stops us think , not bad message little drive-in movie 70 	1
i never seen queen damned until last night , when i just finished anne rice novel queen damned . knowing i would soon novel , i curious see movie so i went out moviestop picked up cheap , used dvd copy , despite hearing this movie very bad . turns out , word bad understatement . let me get point , there several changes story , i understand some this needs movies screen time reasons , etc . but i found after reading novel , while basic premise story same novel , pretty much everything gave novel plotline it depth intrigue removed story film adaptation , this movie simply falls flat . i shaking my head end movie such disappointment so much story hacked away . vampires this movie not portrayed amount love feeling intended anne rice , akasha included . maharet , perhaps foremost character novel , basically doesn't show up until end movie simply take part disappointing final showdown . again , all backstory should present here missing . i won't spoil it any those who still plan read novel , but akasha motives what she planning actually logical ( her own evil misguided way ) , but there reason it she saw legitemate , where movie it simply " everybody must die ! " . period . that your motive everything movie building up . i can't stress this enough - depth book gone movie . like i said , i understand things need trimmed/skipped sake screen time , etc ., but this movie barely over 1 1/2 hours long , so much plot development could still included here give this movie depth it lacked . what wrong adding even 30-45 minutes screen time fill story make it 120 or 135 minute film ? heck , i sat theatres all three lord rings movies which all ran over 3 hours . or this movie directed punk kids 10 minute attention spans , rather than fans anne rice vampire chronicles ? such shame , because this movie really potential equal , if not better , adaptation interview vampire . i could go other things this movie i thought just stupid , silly , etc . etc . kind like how other vampires pissed lestat revealing himself world vampire giving away vampiric secrets , yet they decide fly up stage during middle concert , front tens thousands people start fighting , essence " revealing " themselves well , which totally inconsistent why these vampires angry first place . i won't go into all details , because it would take too much writing tell you everything bugged me . bottom line , i guess if you're into cheesy vampire action flicks korn , etc . movie score , then you may still see some value here , but anne rice diehards most certainly find this movie waste their time . but don't let this movie scare you out reading novel , because book much much much better than this movie	-1
i love daria this movie very fitting sign off series . however , some unknown reason , mtv found reason make numerous small cuts throughout movie original version it appeared its original broadcast . jokes deleted , natural conversations characters reduced " just facts , ma'am . " least one scene , which daria decides not go date tom favor staying home , totally cut out movie . ??? original soundtrack also replaced generic music backdrop avoid obtaining video distribution rights original music . i recommend buying dvd if you no other way see broadcast version . i just hope someday mtv someday see fit release it uncensored , well complete unedited season releases .

years after its release i find myself writting what i consider completely biast review this film ( somewhat star wars fan made it difficult look it any negative light before ) . let me first start saying my two daughters love film . me , i grew up watching original star wars ( now titled episode iv , new hope ) . when original star wars came out , it changed way people looked sci-fi . i saw it several times just able focus different aspects sets , props , costumes , etc . it best eye-candy its time far . substance became less important factor if movie couple " holes " story we forgave it watched-on mesmerized its visual splendor likability its characters . almost thirty years later panorama completely different . star wars movies still hold bar special effects but computer-generated world , amazing visuals ocurr within any television comercial , even lowest budget sci-fi television show special effects somewhat convincing or least cool look . effects not make movie " attack clones " more effects than story or even acting matter . awfully silly dialogue doesn't help it neither . retrospect , i wish george lucas would come up two completely different droids than c3po r2d2 ( latter even flies ! imagine , more capabilities than future ) . this premise even absurd world star wars . according story , luke skywalker his uncle owen episode four bought two droids thirty forty years old . i'm typing this review i imagine myself typing it royal ribbon typewriter , just wouldn't happen . it scary find things even too far-fetched world lucas created but movie full them . he doesn't really give any explanation whole trilogy ( i , ii , iii ) why future ships not cool or look act clunkier , or why everything looks dated thirty years now . his world technology goes backwards not other way around . i , however solution all these . george lucas should keep meddling original trilogy until all left original films faces protagonists . everything else should computer re-generated order keep pace future more sync its past . then , you could buy all versions original trilogy ( iv , , vi ) . originally shot , revised version we all saw re-release theaters , " ultimate enhanced version " better match second trilogy ( i , ii , iii ) . maybe he could even re-edited where actors look if they no personalities change dialog sound more confusing . then , you would whole set six films look fantastic but lack every other aspect story telling ( ie ., compelling characters , continuity , interesting plotlines , etc ) . only reason i give movie two stars because wonderful effects created ilm still makes film worth watching least once . otherwise , i rather watch " serenity " which more star wars feel it than this star wars film . nickname " mannequin " " annakin " well-deserved it any negatives regarding characters this poorly told story	1
what it 70 ... decade begged parodied -- almost while we still living it ? watching " seven ups " , just released dvd , its pretty obvious what so " strange " 70 . everything so extreme . clothing extreme ; poverty extreme ; automobiles extreme ; everything either " suede " or " broken glass " . all " schlock " 70 produced , there group incredible crime/cop films came out era . sort 70 " noir " . " seven ups " roy scheider plays leader " special squad " police dealing offenders whose crimes wil guarantee them prison sentence " 7 years or up " hence rather misleading title film . i hadn't seen this film over 25 years when i recently purchased it , watching it time capsule gritty urban 70 . what really surprised me , rewatching it , though , how much subsequent movie tv crime shows " ripped off " this film . that not say this film didn't its own larceny ... there car chase designed out-do " french connection " " bullitt " . but it plot character construction this film , some its contemporaries , set style shows 30 years later still emulating . its character driven ; plot driven ; action filled . watching this movie , i could almost smell diesel fumes transit buses i used ride downtown baltimore 1970s . watch it historical curiosity ; watch it parody ; but you'll also realize you're watching fine example tight story telling still influencing tony soprano his competition today	1

this quite corny adventure film , one least significant movies hitchcock ever made . it deserves two stars maltin . yes , charles laughton good major villain , although his makeup could used some work times , especially during closeups . yes , 19-year-old maureen o'hara beautiful , even if her clothes never stay wet after swimming her makeup never gets smeared . yes , young robert newton okay , even if his commission bearing his police credentials remain dry clear after ocean . but whole , this melodrama one live without . young people especially guffaw hammy ending . worse problem print . it inferior . one point there jump eliminates five or ten minutes story . there no excuse putting this sort print dvd	1
made during horror movie heyday late 1930s early 1940s , this classic suspenseful thriller introduced audiences one most well-known movie monsters ; lon chaney jr. ' " wolf man " . chaney plays larry talbot , who returning his home wales after spending eighteen years united states . larry brother recently killed hunting accident . claude rains stars larry father , sir john talbot . upon returning home , larry helps his father install new lens his telescope . while peering through lens , larry discovers beautiful girl window across street . her name gwen conliffe ( evelyn ankers ) . larry goes over introduces himself , two agree go walk together evening . gwen invites her friend jenny williams come . three decide go their fortunes told group gypsies who set up camp town . jenny goes first . gypsy bela ( bela lugosi ) reads jenny fortune . he immediately disturbed when he sees shape pentagram appear jenny palm . he immediately tells jenny leave . meanwhile , gwen larry walked off their own . minutes later , they hear blood-curdling scream . larry runs investigate finds large wolf attacking jenny . larry manages kill wolf his silver-handled cane , but he bitten process . gypsy maleva ( maria ouspenskaya ) tells larry legend werewolf , if person bitten werewolf survives , they too become werewolf . maleva gives larry charm wear around his neck protect himself , but he gives charm gwen . night full moon , maleva predictions come true , larry talbot transformed into werewolf . charm protect gwen , or she suffer same fate her friend jenny ? this movie remained classic over sixty years , it takes viewer back time before blood-and-guts horror films popular , movie producers relied psychological terror scare audiences . there no blood this movie , but viewer still scared unique movie sets , fog rolling through trees , haunting musical score . lon chaney jr. made his role wolf man famous , he only actor ever played wolf man . although character originally designed boris karloff , chaney made this his signature role . he always remembered wolf man . other actors , especially maria ouspenskaya claude rains , give good performances well . i give this movie my highest recommendation . this film takes me back when i young child , i used stay up late weekends watching scary movies television . remember , " even man who pure heart says his prayers night , may become wolf when wolf bane blooms , autumn moon bright "	1
lovers foreign films find this movie gem . unlike most american offerings , foreign productions rely human relationships emotions drive plot rather than sterotypical situations characters . this film no exception . movie , which more family bonds time crisis then it homosexuality horror aids , candid enthralling beginning end . relationships family members touching , times inadvertently strange , especially if you're american family . love they one comes across very strong actions like cuddling while sleeping same bed incidental nudity among brothers ( things considered inappropriate other cultures ) not any way sexual but simply natural part family life . my opinion good movie allows you think bigger issues . while watching " close leo " i couldn't help but wonder how much stronger stable people , turn societies , would if most families like this . maybe cultures general too quick demonize think such activities suspect or improperly sexual . even family questionable decision keep plight marcel favorite brother secret made out concern compassion not selfishness or malice . climax film contains graphic sexuality nudity leo hostel keeper , but it very realistic poignant way . it here where audience able see how leo deep familial love enables him make final unselfish choice . deciding change his previous wanton behavior send marcel back home alone paris , he makes decision take possession his own pain over his death refuse allow anyone family take it upon themselves . definitely " must see " if you get opportunity	1

" body soul " elevated conspicuous morality tale classic film virtue its supporting cast . william conrad terrific gruff , two-faced , but somehow sympathetic quinn , even though he few lines . charley gold digging mistress , alice , even less prominent character , played memorably hazel brooks . charley fianc�e beloved peg , art student aspiring painter played lilli palmer , odd character . she intelligent , articulate , temperate -in contrast charley . but her european accent refined demeanor make her seem out place film lower east side . somehow , this works film favor putting peg moral pedestal .

late `70s early `80s walter hill one best action/thriller directors . like don siegel sam peckinpah before him , hill made lean , gritty no-nonsense genre pictures like warriors , southern comfort 48hrs . he understands what drives action film visual storytelling through kinetic editing . this what propels his under-appreciated movie , driver finally seeing its debut dvd . near dialogue-less opening heist/getaway sequence foreshadows same kind approach michael mann would later apply his own urban crime thrillers , most notably , thief , which owes huge debt driver terms style attitude . first car chase , where driver evades several police cars through city streets night epitome stylistic economy . there no cgi , no special effects ; just judicious use editing letting action tell story . hill employs classic , no frills style filmmaking almost non-existent today climate which all music video style editing ( which he dabbled streets fire ) . he doesn't feel need spell things out through dialogue or providing unnecessary back stories . it not important where this guy came or we even like him . this movie battle wills driver detective . there three-minute " alternate beginning " which establishes , early , detective work philosophy also two women driver life . this prologue originally aired television . also included theatrical trailer . sadly , fox not included 135 minute version shown los angeles american cinemateque , which apparently included more car chases	1

i think there weird kind disconnect modern audiences when they watch silent film , despite fact carl theodor dreyer vampyre fact " talkie " , i don't think any movie could illustrate point better . sound motion pictures new enough when this film made film-makers clearly adjusting idea . dialogue minimal , sound effects sparse enough jarring , most movie plays like some victorian goth kid fever dream . combination minimal sound beautiful atmospheric visuals make something very unique unsettling . definitely worth watching . hard-core vampire fans should warned : despire title , this movie more haunted house story than vampire story . if you're dying vintage bloodsucking , you should probably check out other 1931 vamipre movie . you know , one starring romanian guy seasme street	1

fan nick park style claymation , i gave this product four stars . but second season creature comforts not universally accessible first . starters , there greater use harder understand british accents ( yorkshire , urban youth talk , heavy scottish , etc ) , which fine bbc afficiandos such myself , but others , especially children , may find it bit difficult sort through sounds hear what interviewees saying . keeping mind this series made uk , references pop culture side ocean may more obscure humor more elusive neophytes . material well seems bit mature younger audiences . parents may wish screen episodes before watching them their children . it strictly pg+ , not quite racy enough pg13 , but bit more advanced than some may feel comfortable ( think juicier bits " rabbit " ) . but quality animation remains strong . little details which we all love - background characters moving response what interviewees saying - up standard excellence which we expect ardman product . humor still there , enjoyable those who appreciate british style wit . previously noted , this set contains separately sold christmas special - which very fun episode , indeed , but not worth buying twice . so , if you're nick park fan , this you . but newbie may put off difficult accents unfamiliar subjects	1

o.k. , except old farts who don't like profanity , wheezer who only thought 20 minutes it entertaining chick who thought intro lame ( bill murry send-up reservation theme genius ) , this very funny dvd . there definitely some lame moments ( david spade trying too hard `cooler than everyone else room ' shtick ) , some painful moments ( adam sandler piece embarrassingly horrible ) yet one more intensely boring musical piece lately ubiquitous prince , whose own shtick sexual ambivalence , wimpy voice imminently forgettable tunes only rival his/her movie exploits tedium . anyhow , although i think madtv folks occasionally find finer honed edge than snl crowd ( first two seasons consistently funnier ) , they also taped would hard time doing it live consistent basis . like ebb flow sun-spot activity , snl good bad casts , strong weak seasons , but always something going makes it worth while watching , almost always pulls off one immensely funny skit during evening . this collection those efforts . don't miss it . i just wish they would release 15th anniversary taping . it hilarious .	1

geez .... way back then , i absolutely loved alice . thirty years later it all looks so immature ridiculous . his theatrical broadway antics just look wimpy . i still think alice probably pretty cool guy , i love hearing his older music ( killer still his best album ) , but this dvd really sucks . it probably deserves 1 star , but i can't bear give alice failing grade , so out kindness my heart , i'll give him 2 stars . stay away this dvd . oh yeah ...... they promote this dvd extra shocking gross ........ it not , compared today standards . this whole disc just seems silly	1
child i pen pals one swarm stars : christian juttner . christian came up through disney farm team system ( creating child actors ) . he only good thing this miserable dreck . don't get me wrong - he over acting , but he isn't chewing up scenery like so many others this long , drawn out pot boiler/action film . irwin allen produced swarm . he also created " towering inferno , " " earthquake , " " posiedon adventure " among vast list low grade science fiction/action television series . allen used formula each his films/television series . he doesn't stray it here . michael caine his most painfully horrible , overacting so badly he verges manic personality . olivia dehaviland embarrasses herself god-awful southern accent overacts so badly she seems doing skit impression herself acting class how not act . fred mcmurray saddled dismal dialogue but doesn't actually embarrass himself . allen throws us bevy a-list actors silver screen era , only squander waste them . script absolutely painfully bad . nothing quite makes sense ( not this silliness could ever really make sense . apparently , swarms african killer bees sitting around procreating mustering up nerve declare war all texas ( although only idiot would not realize sets used hollywood hills backlots everywhere hollywood ) . what if these swarms get together create one huge swarm ? what indeed ?! opening film : large group men orange mechanics overalls orange motorcycle helmets wander around military facility without uttering word - this takes place over twenty minutes . apparently we understand these boys orange scientists military personnel assigned investigate disaster : military installation decimated something .... but what ? lab quite obviously allen television series : 20000 leagues under sea lost space . when they speak , you wish they just shut up instead uttering such drivel . now , we believe these bees kill quickly efficiently leaving no tell tale signs what killed victims . first all there would huge welts victims secondly there would some dead bees ( they tell us they've only discovered one bee carcass - i got news you - if i'm getting stung swarm bees , i'm still going get few good slaps take out more than zero bees ) . christian juttner character part first onscreen attack . his parents killed they set up picnic ( thank heavens , because neither them act)- juttner mercifully spared because he sent car thermos ... he drives car(covered bees ) into backlot ... um , i mean nearby town whisked off hospital treatment his bites . he later sneaks out some friends antagonizes swarm bees picnic area where his parents died . then he runs around talking michael caine promises watch over some woman caine taken liking . next we see juttner bed hospital sick , dying , dead ! wow ! where this come ? dehavilland agonizes only high school freshman acting student would over deaths dozens school children playground ( however never we actually see bee any these kids ) . no where film we see any indication bees actually stung any victims . there no welts , no marks , no redness . they're just .... dead . ( i've actually attacked hive full hornets .... let me tell you - they leave huge welts you - all red , sore painful ) . this film great if you want really bad cinema . it not even remotely good though . please run ... run quickly .... swarm !	-1
warner brothers commended assembling this triple feature set classic randolph scott films single two-sided dvd . although this not scott best work -- look " 7 men now " or " ride high country " -- these b-westerns very , very entertaining not missed any fan westerns or good stories . early 1950s technicolor looks great transfers appear made very good source materials . i only wish wb would made least bare bones scene selection menu and/or added trailers these other scott films . also , anamorphically enhanced transfers would nice considering current proliferation 16x9 monitors . i shied away buying this disc initially because these indeed b-movies not scott best work but i found them very , very enjoyable westerns . so much so i'm ordering other wb set scott westerns . sit back , relax allow yourself watch randolph scott ride again !

alfred hitchcock my favorite director ! it impossible me pick favorite film there too many i love cannot live without . however , one i seem come back more so than others " rope " . plot ( based off leopold/loeb murder 1924 ) pure hitchcock . two grad students/roommates strangle fellow student hide his body inside trunk . trunk then covered tablecloth , candles food used party entertain ( who else ) victim family friends . i love fact this first movie shot real time . hitch makes his cuts every ten minutes ( length film camera could hold 1948 ) closing out character back , trunk or wall . thing i always pay attention how fake backdrop outside large livingroom window looks amazingly real film carries sun sets . kudos property master lighting department ! hitchcock also loved anything taboo perverse . he went great lengths let us know these two roommates not only killers but they lovers well ! overtones unmistakeable i can't believe it got past censors . john dall farley granger play it up nines ! i won't spoil ending or tell you why two men decided murder their victim first place . i tell you this definitely hitchcock first masterpiece ! pure suspense ! go buy or rent it right now ! you won't sorry	1
why ? because if you're here , you probably already saw movie just curious this release version . so i'll tell you it . first , good : - comes official movie soundtrack . i mean full soundtrack , it separate disc . - video transfer lot better than original dvd release . - case designed lot more appealing than standard black blue . - audio better encoded easier hear lower volumes . - lots extras , including some fluff , but hey . - better aspect ratio , picture fills widescreen displays more evenly without stretching . now , bad : - soundtrack ... it so irritating listen , because they managed true movie version " nothing but love " some other songs , fresh movie , but yet " nights like this " after 7 version . i don't mind after 7 version , it not bad , but i wanted hear movie version . this especially troublesome when they even managed byrd song fresh movie . - some footage never made it movie should . like scene where duck explaining all members sing all different levels . it would explain later scene when choirboy offers sing eddie place - when i watched first version i confused . soprano singing baritone parts ? also , there some slight comedy pieces there should included . - some extras just flat out pointless - or if they wanted include them least include characters people cared . there one extra where actors kayfabe giving their thoughts before accepting ' awards ' . totally corny , but it might entertaining if eddie kang jr. jt there . there only 3 five present . - general movie negative ... they never explain what happened bobby , beginning movie . i hoping deleted scene would explain this , but alas ... so , would i recommend getting this ? absolutely , because i almost guarantee it won't released hd-dvd or bluray	1

d.o.a. ( 1950 ) one those films i try watch once year ( lot easier since purchasing it dvd ) it classic american film-noir mystery/drama quite bit going it , few , minor flaws ( minor flaws tend stand out little more here because most other aspects so strong ) . directed rudolph mat� ( when worlds collide , violent men ) , accomplished cinematographer prior moving into realm directing , feature stars oscar winning character actor edmond o'brien ( hitch-hiker , barefoot contessa , wild bunch ) . also appearing pamela britton ( " blondie " , " my favorite martian " ) , lynn baggett ( time their lives ) , luther adler ( voyage damned ) , beverly garland ( alligator people ) , william ching ( lonely place ) , laurette luez ( prehistoric women ) , neville brand ( halls montezuma , stalag 17 ) , his first credited feature film role . fans television show " green acres " , keep eye peeled frank `sam drucker ' cady , he got bit part early bartender . film opens we see man entering large , metropolitan police station head towards homicide division . upon arriving , we learn he there report murder ... his own ! turns out man name frank bigelow ( o'brien ) , he accountant small , californian town , which we move into lengthy flashback he relates his tale . frank works small , podunk town secretary/girlfriend paula ( britton ) , it seems paula little put out fact frank announced , very short notice , he taking trip san francisco get little time himself . frank arrives his hotel , joint jumping conventioneers , group them frank ends up hooking up ... after night out town frank returns hotel wakes next morning feeling rather poorly , enough so cause him see doctor , which he then informed he poisoned ! not only , but poison fatal , he got perhaps week , most , live . some vacation ... anyway , frank eventually discovers his predicament deliberately caused , sets out discover whos whys . trail leads frank minor business dealing he some time ago character named renoylds , one involving sale some precious metals . frank delves deeper into mystery he stirs up hornet nest trouble , mainly himself , there those who don't appreciate his sudden interest their affairs , runs afoul some thugs , result if poison coursing through his system doesn't kill him , various bullets thrown his way might ... i think one more interesting aspects this film me how o ' brien character just wasn't entirely likeable fellow beginning , one i found myself rooting end ( albeit halfheartedly ) . you see , scenes near beginning , frank portrayed sort philanderer , especially once he hits san francisco . , itself wouldn't mean much me , except fact he stringing swell dame paula ( ms. britton looked incredibly beautiful here , but not inaccessible ) who completely devoted him , so much so she willing put up his peccadilloes . sure she gets miffed , but she always ends up coming around , , one point , she basically tells frank there isn't anything he would cause her feelings him falter ... probably not something you should relate someone wandering eye . once frank accepts his predicament ( whole dying thing ) , he eventually come around , realizing what important , so there strong , moral element involved . element i enjoyed character chester thug , played neville brand , who appears later story . it always fun when they throw sadistic , wild-eyed psychotic mix , especially one who tends refer himself third person call his handgun `baby ' . there couple really great lines dialogue present , one which i used title this review . it occurs once frank begins unraveling mystery his murder , he gets terse femme fatale whom he believes involved ( she ) , which she tells him " if you man i'd punch your dirty face . " . good one comes just prior this , he strong arming tight-lipped secretary , played beverly garland , into spilling her guts telling her she " this right up your pretty , little neck ! " . i thought performances , direction , writing , cinematography all very strong , complimented wonderfully dimitri tiomkin vibrant musical score . pacing quick leads up exciting engaging climax , one definitely worth sticking around ... there one aspect i find annoying , it wasn't fact so many fabulous babes seemed willing throw themselves slightly paunchy edmond o'brien . it involved usage slide whistle . o'brien character arrives his hotel san francisco early , every time he sees babe there simulated wolf call sound effect created slide whistle . now this something i'd expect screwball comedy starring jerry lewis , but not something fits material here , especially given rather dramatic opening sequence . i'm unsure who decided throw particular sound effect , but they didn't picture any favors . it certainly doesn't ruin film , but i thought i should warn those interesting see it , it may draw you out feature it me , eliciting " what fudge ? " response . despite minor point , rest gold , especially if you're fan noir . it looks if this film release onto dvd various times , few , different companies , but version i own released image entertainment , part wade williams collection . dvd case states source material used restored producer negative . picture , presented full screen ( 1.33 : 1 ) look clean sharp , but there minor imperfection throughout ( no frames seem missing , though ) . far dolby digital mono audio , it seemed me levels weren't entirely consistent , i found myself regularly adjusting volume ( maybe my ears going bad , i don't know ) . there aren't any extras included , but there chapter stops . i haven't seen other dvd releases so i can't compare this them , but i'm familiar enough image entertainment dvd releases feel comfortable saying overall quality here probably better than some less expensive releases . i notice roan release available , i've found their releases solid , so if your looking less expensive version but still better than average quality , might way go . cookieman108by way , i've seen 1988 remake featuring dennis quaid meg ryan ... it not bad , but comes up lacking when compared original , my opinion .	1
this movie decent movie lot gore but plot weak acting horrible . kim myers good actor but she not fit this roll like she bloodline . freddy still psycotic killer but he changed into more jokester which really killing series . also mark patton character whines cries through out movie like little baby it really kills movie . this movie just hardcore fans or people collecting entire series . this only gets two stars because violence gore .	1
perhaps i love this movie so much simply beacuse i just now happened upon it . i hadn't heard it , now i see it came out 2002 . wow , where i ? this one twisted chick one twisted film . thing obviously attracts us female character her beauty , brains . no one could this evil still men chasing her without " something . " " something " she sexy -- real knock-out . scene bar where she checks out berg equipment under table can't beat . sort outdoing " sally met harry " 2002 . berg plays it cool , great " secret " his life finally revealed toward end movie . if you enjoy movies where you don't know how things going turn out , check out last seduction it fill all your needs	1
i getting tired watching this movie probably because i didn't really like charactor franklin he just getting my nerves he just felt like bagage girl friend ( i forget charactors name ) i got mad when franklin wasn't doing his part relationship , even if he couldn't get job , he could least helped out baby more so mother child didn't lose out her dream becoming singer . perhaps if she didn't meet him she might made it . all fairness franklin there times when girlfriend provoked franklin insecurities . example when he brought tickets concert them her birthday she traded them better seats . thats no no you don't take gift back front person who brought you gift , would hurt anybody make them feel unappreciated . all all i thought it somewhat realistic story relationship man woman trying keep it togetherarguments breakup all . ending kind leaves you hanging but you assume they try get back together	1

glass cage piece work should not overlooked . when i saw film apt pupil , i thought it decent film some superb acting , but sadly i felt hollywood watered movie down when it came portraying nazi mentality , decadence , cycle abuse , cruelty . after viewing glass cage , i finally seen what other film could become if it not hollywood politics , since then i kept ever closer eye foreign cinema . glass cage both tale mental decay revenge . this story revolves around german family relocated isolation spain after fall 3rd reich , young man(angelo ) , who child abused patriarch family , klaus ; former ss officer . angelo tracked klaus down , catches him committing brutal act against youth . klaus ' brutal act sends klaus over mental edge , fit despair , he makes failed suicide bid , confining him iron lung glass windows(the glass cage ) . angelo , gathered some sensitive journals depicting klaus ' crimes , uses this his past klaus coerce klaus into allowing angelo into household " care " paralyzed helpless klaus . angelo quickly begins corrupting family , gaining daughter affections simultaneously gaining abhorance family matriarch , while keeping klaus edge making him relive atrocities he tried escape . first angelo this through reading journals atrocities klaus , eventually angelo descends deeper into madness , begins committing atrocities his own . starting matriarch house , angelo begins kill , he quickly moves children like described journals he reads . torture klaus who both adores despises himself very things he now forced watch come full circle . his wife dead , his daughter controlled angelo , he forced relive himself . this where uncompromising nature piece really takes hold . children put death this film , viewer not spared agony this implications , or off-camera violence . this happens your face , even very first scene klaus youth . it places bitter slice nazi cruelty right your mouth you taste . eventually this cruelty aimed klaus himself , eerie aid daughter , mental schism becomes complete , angelo assuming role klaus glass cage . i found this film more dramatic shocker than art-house film , but story solid acting top notch , especially when approaching subject matter . glass cage not shock simply degrade viewer , rather presents violencce " this how it went down " fashion . nothing glamorized no character particularly likeable , they simply they programmed better or worse , which right point context naziism . if visually-presented subject nazi cruelty regarding homosexuality , petiphilia , grotesque murder children would get you leave room , then this film not you . but those you seeking uncompromising cinema ...	1
2-disc , director cut , my expectations perhaps too high this dvd . nevertheless , i appalled poor quality transfer . colors dull throughout , focus frequently not beginning scenes . movie itself , i don't agree it holding up well over time . 25 years old , movie just limited entertainment value people who aren't waiting their beloved canceled tv series big screen . there no question ii iv best series , but comparing it other star trek original cast movies isn't putting bar very high . my interest watching this again just finished melville moby dick , final scenes which khan repeats liberally during final space battle . said , i think montalban fantastic revenged-obsessed khan very evocative ahab . however , shatner pretentious kirk just becomes more grating time goes . original cast schtick just doesn't make compelling drama	1

quiet deliberate movie ultimately suffers too much star power . no matter how scruffy wain filmmakers try make nicole kidman look , she still nicole kidman . her portrayal janitor really pushes limits " suspension disbelief " her delicate features legs go forever . anthony hopkins also miscast jewish professor hard knock , secret past . while he remains one my favorite actors , he cannot escape his " britishness " which even more unbelievable once you discover what his character past ! real discovery this film wentworth miller absolutely astonishing turn teenage anthony hopkins . ultimately , film worth seeing wentworth miller alone . but casting two megawatt hollywood actors hurts believability this film end	1
you like zombie movies ? course you , otherwise you wouldn't here . but you like piss-poor make-up design , god-awful special effects horrendous lighting ? probably no t.t he best thing i say this flick it comes 2 discs . first ( plaga zombie)is almost certainly college project . ( so i won't comment further one . but second disc ( plaga zombie : mutant zone ) should better since it follow-up bigger ( i assume ) budget . anyways ; music little over-exaggerated seemed like it trying make this flick more serious than it really . ( except " john west " song , which i still find myself singing . fact whole scene best part movie . ) when it comes zombie comedies , you alot better than this one . ( ie : dead-alive , return living dead part 2 , shaun dead ) don't get me wrong , directors potential . but potential would better geared toward slap-stick comedies , not horror comedies . just side note : main attraction any zombie flick undeads prosthetic make-up . ( peeling flesh/half-eaten lips/severed limbs disembodied torsos/ etc . ) suffice say , absolutely none these zombies even so much resembled zombies . ( or acted like zombies matter ) . they look more like college kids after halloween night . moral story : time money precious commodities . waste them this flick unethical .	-1

this movie just wonderful . first movie great movie well , but i believe this better . i understand many people felt differently . but when you look 2001 version it just plain better . overall . acting , effects , story-line . 1971 version , well 70s . they best they could what they . but this version concentrates more friendship two athletes well family chicago bears provided it players since it beginnings 1920 . pfeifer maher performances wonderful ! coach halas played excellently too ! huge chicago bears fan chicago bears history buff , i'd say this movie almost perfect . oh your tissues ready almost this whole movie because it sadder than first . granted stories same , but they focus more illness not race issue . i believe more important this story than anything else .	1
i am really picky critical what i watch , but i consider wire season 1 masterpiece . give you idea my tastes , one my favorite movies insomnia al pacino . this show even better than , you get enjoy it whole season , not just 2 hours ! everything rings true . dialogue , plot -- everything . plot dialogue remind me movie crash times , only this less over-the-top . it lots philosophical symbolism , but unlike crash it presented subtly rather than beating you over head it . suspenseful moments most suspenseful i've seen anything screen . because it serial , there time complex plot complex characters developed . you get hear bona fide dialect spoken many african-americans dc-baltimore area where i live , vocabulary not dumbed down general audience you would find most movies . you get real thing . lastly , director something i wish more directors would : he dispenses music most part . many directors use music crutch making audience feel emotions they supposed feel particular scene . here , emotional reactions induced good acting alone , it works . watch this show . you won't regret it	1

although not my favorite jim carrey movie , me , myself irene moments pure hilarity . i'm big fan carrey i'm also nice person who stepped one too many times my life . so when charlie ( carrey ) finally snaps grocery store , i feel like i relate only wish i nerve act like his alter-ego , hank , who soon starts taking over . much like me , charlie wasn't always this way . he got married his wife wound up affair black midget limo driver their wedding day . she triplets although it quite obvious charlie not father , he embraces them anyway . then , she leaves him boys . that when charlie starts chipping away . he buries all his anger sadness inside until lo behold , he cannot take it anymore . his first outburst far my favorite . his fellow troopers rhode island force worried him he now take pills keep hank coming out . his boss gives him time off asks him drop off woman named irene upstate new york . epa wants talk her her involvement golf course scam , but irene doesn't know anything it ... her ex before she figure it out , he got everyone coming her . when his guys kill agents charlie left her , irene runs get charlie 2 must leave immediately . course , they hit road , charlie forgets bring his pills soon , irene gets meet hank . but " 3 " them ( charlie , hank irene ) survive lam ? ah , it certainly not carrey best film , but if you're fan , you'll certainly laugh out loud wonderful time . he really great job . if you mute movie , you still clearly tell when he charlie or hank . me , myself irene fun funny , if you've ever felt like you one second away snapping yourself , this one definitely you . enjoy	1
i didn't want start my review this way but , once while there comes movie extraordinary vision independence it must set apart others paradigm follow . pan labyrinth just such movie . far best work fantasy genre come out i'd say since legend . this movie not copy paste version novel little men , nor it poorly adapted screenplay novel written 15 year old . this movie delves deep into nature fantasy itself . what more fantastic than what within human mind ? possibilities , both wonderful horrific , endless . poor little ofelia our guide through human psyche we revel her wonderful fantasies revolted viscious clarity her reality . elements all classic fairytales interspersed within , carefully woven together form new unique tale . some say this movie brutality war , child imagination escapist fancy . i disagree . though movie set time revolution there few , stress few , graphically violent scenes , movie this sharp contrasts hazy , beautiful fantasy scenes . focus more emotion unimaginative reality life . ofelia encounters many monsters , both real mythical , worst captain , her stepfather . this serves strengthen fact some people lives worse than anything we imagine . far cinematography goes , movie shot perfectly . reality dark gritty , dirty yet vividly clear . ofelia fantasy world moments clarity , but overall hazy , like memory sunny summer day long , long ago . mood captured perfectly really brings viewer into picture . soundtrack subtle , enabling viewer visually astounded , yet powerful enough it startle you out your dream when you least expect it . one my favorite things movie narration . narrator voice melodic deep . when narration starts , it just fits so perfectly you couldn't imagine movie without it . watching this movie spanish real treat , even if you don't speak language . so much feeling context gained watching it natural language it completely negates any bad things subtitles . overall , huge recommendation anyone who tired boring , unimaginative complacent productions hollywood . this stimulate mind leave you sad but same time happy	1
movie such this , i pleasantly surprised realistic qualities it held . first i skeptical david duchovny talk over if he doing narritive . really wasn't what it though . it just exerpts things he putting tape later use . once i got my head , movie started flowing pretty nicely . brad pitt excellent job role he played white trash killer who really doesn't understand what he doing even though he knows fact he killed . absolutely no remorse . usual , juliette lewis plays dumb innocent girl astounding accuaracy . either she really good actress she just typecasted , or she just dumb they hire her those types roles just reason . this movie overall great anyone who likes take peek life serial killer . even though it based fiction , brad pitt such good job sticking role gave movie realistic quality . check it out if you into those types movies	1
i really enjoyed this movie . i thought story excellent . i expected frankenstein your classic , everyday , lame horror film which you only watch get some cheap thrills , see some horrible overacting . i didn't find it so all . this movie beautifully - powerful , dynamic story how man attempts achieve greatness , but ends up ruining their lives lives others result . i not read mary shelley book , but if it half emotional effect this movie , i'll consider it time well spent ! kenneth branagh brought this movie together wonderfully , both his directing powerful , memorable acting tormented dr. victor frankenstein . this film quite simply spectacular ! it goes same category hell , they both too sophisticated beautiful just horror films . cleverness this film its sheer radiance must throw some people off . robert de niro creature ! de niro gives foul beast soul his own . well worth look , photography alone makes it worth owning dvd .	1

my second favorite three darin/dee comedies , last one they filmed . obviously not shakespear , but cute premise good supporting cast , great chemistry two leads . esp good donald o'connor , one darin real life heros . it great see them work together . it also demonstrates darin considerable songwriting talent peaked when he commissioned write song specific context , occured many his movies . resulting theme song here , funny feeling , really wonderful infectious . recommended fans darin , dee , or just fans goofy romantic comedies general .	1

tos finally comes end we get volume worthy trek lore . mediocre 3rd season me praying someone put this puppy out its misery but least we get two episodes , second which even more so , worthy inclusion among very best episodes across all 3 seasons here . first episode little silly times but huge redeeming factor me introduction explanation very key characters pivotal future trek series like ds9 e.g. kahless founding father vulcans . also , moral pursuit science knowledge noble worthy causes themselves but not cost misery suffering innocent others i found very relevant even today . second episode one my all-time favourites i even liked it better than " city ... forever . " just episode , there number inconsistencies strange events here like how completely different planet similar history ours musketeers boot ! ignoring this though , side-story spock mccoy simply brilliant . nimoy very good acting job here he shows emotions jealousy anger then reverts his usual self end . very good time-travel episode very easily best episode final season . if you deciding which volumes keep , this one falls under " must " category . recommended	1
following up their success 1974 uptown saturday night , sidney poitier ( raisin sun , guess who coming dinner ) bill cosby ( " i spy " , california suite ) paired up again this film aptly titled let it again ( 1975 ) , which followed their third outing titled piece action ( 1977 ) . directed poitier , let it again featured particularly strong supporting cast calvin lockhart ( uptown saturday night ) , john amos ( " good times " , die hard 2 ) , ossie davis ( right thing ) , denise nicholas ( piece action ) , lee chamberlin ( " electric company " ) , julius harris ( live let die ) , mel stewart ( hammer , trick baby ) , jimmie walker , who top world time his role character james ' . . ' evans , jr hit television series " good times " , his first silver screen appearance . also , keep eye out former heavyweight boxing champion george foreman , sans his foreman grill , jayne kennedy ( muthers ) , former miss ohio one first women land nfl announcing gig , bit parts near beginning ( miss kennedy `legs ' scenes worth watching more than once ) . poitier cosby play couple atlanta working class stiffs clyde williams billy foster , respectively , both who members lodge need new home , city planning tearing down their current location . lodge raised some monies , but not nearly enough fund new building , but billy plan ... one involves clyde using his ability hypnotize . men , their wives , played nicholas chamberlin , leave atlanta weekend getaway new orleans ( billy his wife celebrating their anniversary ) , lodge money hand , intent taking funds betting extreme underdog bootney farnsworth ( walker ) , upcoming boxing match . it sucker bet sure , one local big time criminals kansas city mack ( amos ) biggie smalls ( lockhart ) only too happy take , until they lose because clyde put whammy bootney , making him believe he greatest fighter there ever ... after bootney slaughters his opponent , clyde billy collect winnings , remove whammy bootney , return home , but kansas city mack figures out what happened , finds boys , now wants put them work fixing fight not only get his money back , but also put his rival , smalls , out business same time . boys little choice but participate mack scheme , but they develop their own double-cross , one score their lodge funds necessary new nursery while getting both kansas city mack biggie smalls off their backs good , if things go planned , that big if ... three films poitier cosby together early mid 1970s , this one probably my favorite , uptown saturday night ( 1974 ) piece action ( 1977 ) coming close second third , respectively ... regardless , all three films just whole lot fun , poitier cosby played off so well against each other , assisted wonderful supporting cast each time . what so interesting these movies they originally presented alternative black audiences cinema , time , inundated blaxpoitation films , but ended up appealing wide range audiences due fact they just so entertaining . perhaps funniest bit this film , besides cosby character flashy wardrobe when he disguised his underworld alter ego mongo slade , sequence after jimmy walker character hypnotized confidence up waz . after knocking put his sparring partner , bootney subsequently tears up gym , knocking punching bag through wall speed bag out window amazement everyone ( most all his trainer ) attendance . some aspects feature terribly dated , i.e. wardrobe sported some characters , gangsters seemed particularly goofy ( i found it difficult believe times kansas city mack or biggie smalls could hold down large , criminal operations due ineptness themselves their respective crews ) , but this all good natured fun , so we weren't meant take any it too seriously . cosby character just whole lot fun watch , whether he sticking script , or improvising his own bits . aspect really helped make this film soundtrack legendary curtis mayfield , featuring staple singers their smooth tune " let it again " . his best work , my opinion , 1972 film superfly , but his efforts here certainly outstanding . i think feature ran bit long ( pushing two hour mark ) , poitier could shaved ten minutes off still strong film , but he keep things moving well . story get slightly convoluted during latter half feature poitier cosby characters get their wives involved effort not only score some much needed funds , but also shake criminals off their tails , but given this comedy , more outlandish situations better . perhaps it also important note characters within three films , while very similar , not same so films followed uptown saturday night aren't sequels , but basically follow ups . if you're looking some lighthearted fun featuring some crazy characters even crazier situations , then i'd recommend checking out this film , uptown saturday night ( 1974 ) piece action ( 1977 ) , all certainly fit bill ( again , since let it again piece action aren't actually sequels , order which they're seen doesn't really matter ) . picture , provided anamorphic widescreen ( 1.85 : 1 ) , looks sharp dolby digital mono audio comes through clean . only extras included dvd subtitles ( available english , spanish , french ) , feature length commentary track screenwriter richard wesley new york press film critic armond white . too bad warner couldn't pull together some principal players commentary track i would really enjoyed hearing both but poitier cosby comment their film , but oh well ... cookieman108	1

despite my revulsion using such phrase , best summation i give this work " fair balanced . " director rodger young somehow manages present view escalating situation idaho not tainted , slanted , or driven politically correct agenda . there no bad guys no good guys this docudrama . ( although i might stretch point name " bad guy " deputy director stagg , supervisory us marshal who , upon seeing weaver name front page newspaper , demands stakes raised armed tactical units brought . this particular character gets all 30 seconds ' screen time , but i think it far say , if stagg ego hadn't so badly bruised thought weaver not arrested 18 months , situation could stayed under control . ) working script lionel chetwind , which developed book " every knee shall bow " jess walter , young frankly amazing job portraying weavers ' early life together , dropping hints racism , separatism , some decidedly unorthodox religious viewpoints way -- but none it condemning manner . yes , vicki randy almost certainly not sort folks you'd want associate much , but all character flaws , nothing justifies what their situation came . truth , triumphant scene which family finally " discovers " spot land become their home should end story . i've always something laura dern fan , but my admiration this actress talent professionalism definitely raised couple notches her portrayal vicki . you see her eyes fervent belief complete assurances , while perhaps misguided , certainly not out cause trouble or violence -- indeed , end it vicki who asks randy stop associating skinheads , he more than happy so , clearly not very comfortable association all . disintegrating lines communication vicki rest her family especially well performed particularly hard watch . quaid , he manages deliver soul truly conflicted man , even behind exhausted eyes someone who finds himself number-one subject discussion across america when all he truly ever wanted left alone raise his family . bradley pierce puts across absorbing combination childhood innocence hard-hearted bigotry into role 14 year-old sammy weaver , who , together jacob davis younger version sammy , turn character into audience favorite time marshals open fire . it when family starts associating area neo-nazis aryan nations members kirsten dunst really starts shine story , absorbing hateful propaganda neatly tying it into religious views which her mother diligently raised her . end result both compelling disturbing . darren burrows also delivers first-rate performance weaver family friend kevin harris , who manages anchor weaver reality even he lies bleeding delirious . particularly compelling performance brought life bruce locke , who plays fbi sniper lon horiuchi , who killed vicki even she held her baby . locke injects sense anger naked revenge into eyes sniper -- this man who chosen interpret already badly-explained revised rules engagement himself , all he think getting even evil bastards who killed us marshal william degan . also worth look joe don baker legal living legend gerry spence " silkwood " notoriety , who manages switch some desperately-welcomed humorous moments movie coda . few points trivia : works hal lindsey ( " late great planet earth " ) referenced early story catalyst shaping vicki weaver beliefs . longtime independent journalist . orlin grabbe , one first publicly denounce fbi domestic terrorists , appears extra several scenes . short , movie not flinch : weaver loving dad devoted husband , but also bigot petty thief . feds framed him , botched case , overstepped their authority . there no excuses . nobody comes out this story completely innocent not single tenet hollywood-style political correctness observed . no single scene truly emerges pivotal " here where it all went wrong " moment . gary graham performance reluctant us marshal particularly convincing -- here law enforcement figure obviously doesn't want follow up this case would happily let him , but orders he getting above . movie takes us one sequence bad decisions next , ultimately revealing real " villain " piece miscommunication . marshals aren't listening local residents , weaver not listening his neighbors , vicki isn't listening her parents ( nor they listening her ) , press isn't listening marshals , us attorney isn't listening atf case agent , course fbi isn't listening anyone . it only end action when bo gritz ( excellently played bob gunton ) delivers horrifying news agitated crowd " villain " reveals itself -- one deft move , gritz defuses miscommunication , states simple truth , even calms down unruly ready-for-blood mob . federal government learn its lesson tragedy ruby ridge ? well , course . you just imagine internal memos flying around : " next time , punch holes walls tanks , flood place flammable gas , then shoot anyone who tries escape fire . " hats off hollywood this effort , particularly quaid , dern , young delivering product tells story without apology never slants audience sympathies too far one side or other . clear warning trumpet very much worth renting or owning , regardless your religious views , or where you think you fall political spectrum	1
whole " women prison " drama where they sexual realtionships quite nauseating watch . i guess it becasue i've worked prisons this kind show so ridiculous , usa male version ( oz or prison break ) . least male prison shows , there agenda escape , or some attempt everyday life prison ; whereas this show depicting healthy relationships . what makes this show more ridiculous love affairs women . not there aren't those female facilities . they just aren't like how they depcited this show . they create these soap box love stories don't ring true . more than likely affairs women prison manipulative , controlling , always volatile , never romantic . there usally so much dysfunction chaos created around female inmate relationships . it never positive experience , dysfunction real female inmate vs tv inmate makes latter unbelievable . reality , women prison isn't healthy environment where healthy relationships evolve . it place where women offenders various crimes grouped together , egoes , violent behaviors , battered scars , addiction patterns really surface create nauseating work environment officers staff . anyone who ever worked prisons any length time would view this cringe . it insulting women prison staff media comes out these show	-1

watching 1972 " poseidon adventure " again , after seeing 2006 remake , shown no amount bombastic digital effects reduce impact original " poseidon adventure . " " poseidon adventure " all heart character development , it makes you laugh , cry your heart race-especially during tidal wave sequence . scene still gets me much now , it when i first saw movie little kid . movie simply brilliant all levels , acting , special effects , atmosphere . believe me , i don't throw word ' brilliant ' around loosely . thing always felt most chilling me film few seconds dead silence ballroom soon ship finished turning over . it might've unintentional dialogue earnest borgnine , but during scene where he helping move christmas tree , you make him out saying : " holy --- it heavy .

first , commentor erronously stated happy days owes its inspiration american graffiti when actually pilot ron howard shot 1971 ( eventually shown love american style episode 1972 ) then shelved garry marshall . it said lucas even asked look footage ascertain whether howard would suitable steve bolander . course excitement project reivigorated success american graffiti , but no way owes inspiration it . movie , it nearly perfect . even though it half-generation before my own , it still evokes sense nostalgia . there ache soul when one contemplates cusp change , losing something special , knowing best days slipped into past . this movie captures this concept magnificently . acting superior , editing great , direction pitch perfect ( why star wars i-vi inhabited wooden cut-outs mystery me ) . movie doesn't overstay its welcome almost 2 hours it flies , if anything seems too short , not characters underdeveloped , you just want see more what soon memory . movie treat you just want it even bigger . it nice level it ron howard richard dreyfus before they became ron howard richard dreyfus . relative unknowns performances generally free pretensions . all around must see movie my top 10	1
i read several reviews series , devoted viewer during series ' run , i think uproar lack original soundtrack music laced each episode tempest teapot . producers these dvd faulted , however , not printing disks correct markings so we know which episodes disks . they mysteriously blank making it real guessing game which disk play , especially if you trying stay original sequence . other than , this show writing its best creative direction , faultless photography location , fine ensemble cast . filmed fictional alaska town cicily without laugh track or live audience sound stage , each script stood test time multiple stories taking place each episode . one particular episode one my favorites . character , ed , gave storekeeper ruth ann mason jar dirt her birthday . it grave site he bought her . end episode pays off ed heart-felt gift he drives ruth ann site overlooking magnificent river valley . she then askes ed first " dance grave " her . tears viewer guarenteed . so , my fellow devotees , give up your angst over original soundtrack remember scripts , dialogue performances what they : unforgotable collectable	1
her comic teaming rock hudson tony randall 1959 mega hit " pillow talk " , produced ross hunter doris day , ten years successful film work already behind her entered into her most successful period film stardom where her teamings likes hudson , james garner cary grant made her most popular female star her time . less well known this period this once only pairing she david niven 1960 " please don't eat daisies " . despite not high profile like day/hudson teamings this effort went become huge hit mgm ended up studio biggest money earner year after " butterfield 8 " , starring elizabeth taylor . while not hilarious comedy vein this effort provides interesting balance drama comedy its story theatre critic rise heights his profession who then discovers he loses everything real value including his family way . chief joy " please don't eat daisies " , my belief most pleasing very compatiable chemistry two very different lead performers . doris day david niven work off each others very different personality surprisingly effective way which makes them appear like they indeed real married couple trying cope change their personal professional crcumstances resulting husband getting his big break theatre critics circle . although doris day most fondly remembered comedies late 1950 early 1960 " sex comedies " , rock hudson james garner , this quietly amusing family comedy something every doris day fan should include their film collections . film one those early 1960 efforts successful it spawned mid ' 60 television series same name lasted couple seasons but which course not doris day david niven leads . different type leading man englishman david niven , doris proves herself just adept working him she american leading men she her more famous collaborations . while not funny or memorable day/hudson teamings such films " pillow talk " , " lover come back " , i strongly recommend you take time sit down enjoy this often quite serious little domestic comedy some themes just timely today they 1960 . doris day always highly entertaining any her films whether they drama or comedy mgm 1960 hit " please dont eat daisies " , no exception . enjoy	1

i afraid even before watching this movie degree realism going par days thunder ( cars slamming into each other constantly , wrecked cars winning races , etc ) it only took few minutes viewing me realize this movie far , far worse . aside fact none actors could perform their way out old paper bags , movie moves such rapid pace it almost makes you dizzy . now degree realism . i understand not all car races electrifying , but i see no reason there spectacular crash every single race . i never 18 years watching indycar races seen car go flying off track into water hazard . that why barriers there . also , those indycars aerodynamically designed so if track turned upside-down , cars would stay glued course , yet they fly off ground this movie like they made out tissue paper . good lord , joyride through chicago stupidest scene whole movie . it would interesting scene aside fact indycars can't start themselves . even worse , neither one drivers even gets trouble it ...... don't get it . this movie makes days thunder look like masterpiece cinema . if you want watch racing movie , rent . not driven . absolutely not driven	-1
this movie kept me edge my seat whole 90 minutes ... especially when ending movie came around . all i say expect big twist . when movie over , i sit 5 minutes think ending .... then i realized i idiot not noticing all clues showed up during movie lol . anyway , this movie deserves 5 star rating just ending itself	1
this astounding film so prescient regarding our current plight it could considered prophetic . andy griffith astonishing his role lifelong failure screw-up who discovered groomed into folksy demagogue svengali-like character ( portrayed movie patricia neal life karl rove ) . fronting sinister group conservative wealthy big-business-types , larry " lonesome " rhodes manages get one them elected president talking him up stints joking , banjo-playing " jes ' folks " radio ( here fiction present reality diverge somewhat ) . familiar me his work " andy griffith show " , i not seen such remarkably successful casting against type since avuncular fred mac murray 60 tv show " my three sons " played weaselly , self-serving navy officer " caine mutiny " . you might say this movie happy ending : just when " lonesome " rhodes zenith his power popularity , patricia neal decides leave microphone open after one his broadcasts ends so public learn what he really thinks them . instead folksy patter , country stupefied they overhear venomous contempt them stream their radio speakers . , rhodes finished . concluding half-hour which follows harrowing scene rhodes returns his luxurious home proceeds emotionally disintegrate before eyes skeptical unsympathetic walter matthau . ( people who made " network " get their ideas peter finch character breakdown this scene ? ) standpoint story whole , movie could ended soon after scene open mike , but sight ol ' " lonesome " raving , bawling , wallowing self-pity one viewer not likely forge t.t he most disturbing thing this film evident faith elia kazan-a patriot who endured much vilification testifying against stalinist communists movie industry-that people , though mislead , would eventually catch would right thing . no means clear moment . instead , there plenty evidence public turned away serious news ( it may tell them things they not want hear ) towards infotainment plays their fears , hates , vanities , delusions ignorance . contrast , they shown themselves appallingly credulous towards official assurances prevarications sort usually seen only nazi or soviet propaganda . indeed totalitarian propaganda , even " lonesome " rhodes ' pseudo-populist cornpone seem hopelessly primitive compared today state art . even so , worst lies always ones told one self . when country reacts officially condoned torture murder prisoners something like `they would never ! besides , what wrong it anyway ? ' , then reality finally trumped any possible satire-even satire brilliant this film 	1

i gave my daughter this 2 disc edition christmas now gotten see extras included second disc . movie itself looks great what i think improvements stage production ( switching cool gee officer krupke ; swapping america tonight ; adding boys america ) but i wish they not omitted ballet sequence . get cast recording carol lawrence larry kert hear how great ballet sequence sounds . this musical deserves seen big screen ( or least big screen tv killer sound system ) appreciated wonderful score . everything could said songs bernstein sondheim wrote said so i can't add anything there . forget idea natalie wood playing puerto rican enjoy great movie . see stage production if it ever comes your town	1
start out , i won't even comment your inability , ( or rigid unwillingness i can't conceive anyone thick enough not ability , ) grasp concept synergy , i.e. buckminster fuller , i.e. sum whole greater than , or capable transforming definition seperate parts , but , i think your bent mind you obscured clouds narrow perception . you even know meaning word obtuse ? i don't think so . this film extremely existential anthropomorphic but quite reverse obtuse . so , risk truly obtuse , look word up dictionary . then try using it proper context . but then , if you weren't so obtuse you would already know . but i digress , review : this film , ( while admittedly bit afield novel , well extremely toned down sexual angle ) , fairly brilliant scene where ' agent ' conversation ' agent ' while walking down street , mouthing conversation while we hear each person private thoughts , while not original concept , quite original style . ( woody allen same thing you recall ' annie hall ' but subtitles . using actual ' thought dialogue ' voices cronenberg raised device kitchiness surreallism . cool !	1
cheech chong already bunch albums under their belts since 1971 , so they weren't exactly new when up smoke hit theaters september , 1978 . i often seen this movie network tv , unfortunately , it so drastically butchered because they censor lot , not mention all commercials . but course i get this movie vhs or dvd . i ended up dvd , which some bonus features , including bunch unused clips , even audio commentary lou adler cheech marin movie , i actually got some useful info them movie , some trivia it ( like vw beetle tommy chong driving rolls royce radiator strapped front near beginning film actually belonged jack nicholson ) . it seemed only natural lou adler would direct this film , after all , cheech chong albums produced adler ( released his ode label , which included various music acts like carole king psychedelic band spirit ) . it fantastic film full laughs . much what i want say i can't say here because it won't get posted ( because content ) , but it basically two hippies trying escape law , get deported mexico , return america van made marijuana , enter rock band contest . speaking which , there this scene during " rock fight " ( where these punk rock bands play ) there this one singer who so badly wanted mick jagger , it hurts , audience started throwing beer cans him ( music sounded like stones ripoff ) . but course , end cheech chong performing " earache my eye " ( alice bowie this movie ) . this cut originally appeared their wedding album ( 1974 ) , but course it only musical part included this film . speaking music , while saturday night fever capitilized disco craze , up smoke seemed pick up punk rock craze . both styles music came out around same time ( though disco much more popular america because it moneymaker ) pretty much brought end prog rock psychedelia came before it . what really strange cheech marin tommy chong quite bit older than real musicians involved punk rock scene . up smoke truly great movie , so its following , cheech chong next movie , so make sure you get both	1

almodovar making quite name himself recently , it easy see why . his films called daring while still engaging topics particular focus interest society today . his characters willing silent when needed , which good independent film motif some odd reason lot filmmakers don't seem fully understand power . he uses somewhat hitchcockian style his movies , which always good way boost favor amongst critics film snobs . furthermore , this film features none other than gael garcia bernal , strongest actor working spanish-language films one strongest actors around today . short , this film would fail marvelously any less than good , thus it very damn good . storyline itself sort approach could only around today , but which lot stylistic roots we've come accept past , mainly film noir . when two characters exit film noir festival movie say , " it like they us , " it not just almodovar paying homage greats past , it him recognizing expressing exactly what his film . i like it because it several layers narrative narrative-within-a-narrative force me question how much it actually " true " some it may based real life experiences almodovar . however , i don't know because i don't know anything almodovar biography ... i don't care . but point film narrative style forces us question it biographical sources , kind like movie like matrix or existenz forces us question our own reality presenting multiple levels virtual realms . r-rated version : really , my suggestion you see nc-17 version . r-rated version poor job hiding its imagery it badly produced censorship ( including pixellations ... ugh ... ) make it seem more pornographic than scenes actually . -- polarisdi	1

after reading reviews synopsis here amazon ( which same back dvd ) , i thought this looked like it would very good movie promising plot . within first fifteen minutes , however , it not all i expected . first , summary stated anna manni ( police investigator played asia argento , daughter director one only redeeming features this movie ) hot trail serial killer/rapist would captured because attack stendhal syndrome . this misleading because this actually happens early movie ( before any her tracking him down shown ) . other words , if you expecting see movie beautiful , strong-willed police detective trying capture serial killer , this not movie you . instead it [ mostly ] journey into mind greatly disturbed ( possibly psychotic ) rape victim . overall quality this movie also not nearly great it director reputation . this my first dario argento movie , it grave disappointment . after hearing " argento genius , " i really expected movie great editing , dialogue least decent horror movie style soundtrack . this movie instead opposite all counts . finally , style presented leaves lot desired . it basically mashing together sci-fi , horror , drama , even romance doesn't quite work ( some parts so outlandish i could not help but laugh ) . short , save your money worthier movie not follow flawed script begin , not attempt such " stylistic " filmmaking .	1

i intrigued see this film again after " remake " popped up 2005 . scanning all video stores shops cape town try find copy . unfortunately no avail . until " lock-down " special edition popped up - obviously remind us all before adam sandlers version , or vinnie jones ... it burt " deliverance/the bandit " reynolds who delivered blows one all time great prison football movies . i very impressed film made 31 years ago still some kick !!! lets honest , you not going get " matrix " style footage , no overly impressive slow-mo or thumping music - but take it what robert aldrich hoped we would . cleverly made action-comedy offers great way escape 2 hours . film under-tones dirty dozen coming through - recruiting bunch misfits all out spectacular mission . this case , turning tables guards delivering some punishment inflicted them full duration their sentences . all all - still magnificent film . 31 years ago - it must epic . burt - well he always great watch !!! let hear it : " mean machine " , " mean machine " , " mean machine " !!! small footnote those wanting buy it : transfer great . colours good , offered widescreen , but sound mono , not 5.1 ! ( this may just copy offered south africa - but i doubt it ) there also one scene where voice/picture overlay doesn't quite fit ... but flick made 31 years ago ... it all accepted !!! worth shelf watch lazy sunday afternoon !!!	1

( rest assured , young guillan 19 when he made film , but still virgin according director . ) still , it eye-opening moment . so , if you're one easily offended on-screen sexuality , pass this one up . acting pratt guillan perfect . dinner scene particular brilliantly handled . it fascinating watch older woman trying act younger while young boy puffs cigarette vainly tries impress older woman acting much older than he . last fifteen minutes especially ring true , last-minute twist ends film exactly right note . all , " brief crossing " minor film which sacrifices plot tell simple story two disparate souls who make once-in-a-lifetime connection . ending sad but honest , leaves viewer make his own judgments woman behavior .

this movie really good , it arty , scary , gothic , top it off bauhaus begining . it really depressing movie but doesn't take away anything it just makes you love movie much more , but it alittle hard follow sometimes vampires don't really anything cool ( they feed cutting you there cute little necklesses then sucking wound ) but it still works . there mad chicks making out too . i could see why some people would hate it though , it slow sometimes , artiness alittle much sometimes , it really really depressing . but if you're into sort thing this movie perfect you ( i loved it i stole it hollywood video am still collecting late fees )	1
