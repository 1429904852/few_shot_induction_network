old dvd 1997 looks better than new hd version . i've compared two , first dvd good color saturation , dark blacks looked right heavy red brown palette . hd version blue-green haze covering everything picture too bright . they also removed film grain made image look smooth creamy . sound quality better now , though , image course higher resolution .	-1

this movie many ingredients make it truly great , including phenomenal cast , lead cate blanchett , great scenery cinematography . actors playing elizabeth , cecil , walsingham spoke acted admirably , each phrase spoken such honesty feeling , but words themselves rendered performances useless . director author script greatly misunderstood characters material . they should read elizabeth first biography elizabeth jenkins . it useless say movie not need historically accurate but only entertain : author director more historically accurate , they would not created unbelievable character they created elizabeth , who turn hysterical , defeatist , overbearing , childish , tyrannical , who never shows her core intelligence , her great love her people , who private core described her motto " semper eadem " , always one . elizabeth ruled her advisors , she not totally ruled them . she would not put up norfolk screaming her across council table , nor would burleigh allowed it . cate blanchett wonderful acting presence pearls thrown before swine , wasted character portrayal totally lacked any integrity , much less truth . how could director think woman he trying portray any kind real woman ? ending me blushing embarassment one all . we laughably given william cecil wimpy ineffective , walsingham mastermind behind throne . one reviews said director inspired rush play walsingham much like hindu god krishna . i suggest he should first read some english history	-1

2 1/2 stars . this very good concert teaming up pre- " grammy " santana wayne shorter weather report fame . great rhythm section , drums , conga , timbale . top notch musicians , first rate performance , very entertaining . my big problem comes quality dvd . i don't see excellent picture others raving when it comes audio options even if back cover states dd 2.0 , dd 5.1 dts , menus showing something else ( dd 2.0 , dts 2.0 dts 5.1 ) but neither dts stream seem working . only dd stereo works . i own close 200 dvd all work fine , dts all . bought it directly amazon , i it replaced new one same . this not part great live montreux series productions which all great , no matter how old concert . so 2 1/2 stars overall rating comes 4 star performance combined 1 star dvd quality .	-1
let me accept fact lotr my most beloved film i already own extended editions films one set ! i'm really not surprised see new line coming up edition trilogy . films like these they squeeze collectors much they !! still , inspite this new set containing both theatrical versions extended cuts films also much hyped costa botes documentaries , my advise anyone buying lotr first time is- not buy this set ! spend little more you get all movies full 6.1 dts ex glory , alongwith hours endless in-depth bonus features which probably you'll spend rest your life watching !! please aware , these new editions not contain dts tracks , no commentary tracks director , weta workshop or cast . all you get both versions crammed into one single disc just one documentary bonus second disc ... nothing else . it would better idea new line released documentaries separately without forcing consumer buy films again .... even this not end , once hd format gains little more acceptance , they'll excuse come up new version trilogy ! beware , extended edition set ultimate lotr experience , terms films or bonus features . go get it ... its worth all money spent !	-1
first all , who spastic genius who decided concert films change camera angles every five seconds ? this terribly anoying , especially when every third shot same audience members . this may fun home video , but not mass marketed commercial release . dance hall crashers awesome band . much fun seeing dhc concert their highly kinetic stage presence . it would great if this dvd concentrated band whole not just different extreme closeups switched dizzying rate . since dhc supposed focus , why director insist featuring so many shots audience ? it gets your nerves . i love dhc . their live cd permanent place my playlist . but this horribly made dvd only made it through three songs . perhaps if i front stage night , i would appreciate it more .	-1

this movie much better than " vanilla sky . " " vanilla sky " mostly copied " open your eyes " but too obvious less convincing . ( tom cruise , though good some roles , didn't fit this role well . ) " open your eyes " takes little longer draw you , but once it you there it takes you far beyond where " vanilla sky " . also , jungian dream aspect " vanilla sky " poorly , whereas " open your eyes " represents dream experience very well . i recommend watching both movies before you buy one . but if you're going buy , get " open your eyes .	1

these issues explored this film , directed alan . pakula , adapted best selling novel scott turow . it story chief deputy prosecutor rozat " rusty " sabich ( ford ) fictional kindle county , whose seemingly normal life shattered murder female colleague , carolyn polhemus ( scacchi ) . colleague whom he previously engaged affair whom he stalked when she broken off affair . any illusions you may integrity criminal justice system ( this fictional world ) swept away quickly . sabich coerced into heading investigation polhemus ' murder his boss , prosecuting attorney raymond horgan ( dennehy ) . , until horgan loses his reelection campaign new prosecuting attorney nico della guardia ( mardirosian ) his second whip tommy molto ( grifasi ) charge him polhemus ' murder . one great aspects this movie sabich , while heading murder investigation , seems very conflicted his previous encounters polhemus , who we only see flashback sequences during film . we don't know if this because his emotional sexual connection polhemus , or because he murderer himself . suspicions raised concerning sabich guilt throughout first third movie , e.g. , his obstruction his lead investigator detective lipranzer ( spencer ) ignoring fingerprint evidence . this becomes ammunition against him later when he becomes defendant . sabich wife barbara ( bedelia ) throws gasoline fire constantly nettling rusty previous affair , , most important , rusty obsession polhemus which even her death could not end . barbara tries reconnect rusty during movie , but it clear he deeply hurt her affair , rusty knows he lot atone . net starts closing around sabich fairly quickly second third movie . everyone except lipranzer ready willing believe sabich murderer . luckily , sabich hires former adversary sandy stern ( julia ) defend him . stern outstanding defense attorney , his instincts eventually lead winning strategy results dismissal charges against sabich . but , stern asks sabich later film " justice ? " forensic case prepared against sabich interesting because it predates active use dna criminal investigations . also , actions medical examiner " painless " kumagai ( shimono ) alternate comical ridiculous . nevertheless , trial centerpiece movie truly engrossing . trial judge larren lyttle ( winfield ) quite amusing speaks his mind . what we come realize middle film political intrigue , blackmail , sex influence * everyone * film . anyone even tangentially involved case dirty some respect . no one innocent . although you may guess true identity murderer before trial ends , i promise you never forget speech delivered denouement film . sabich says final minute film , " there crime . there victim . there * * punishment .

this great movie won best picture 1987 acclaimed both public critic . oliver stone directs his first movie vietnam ( second " born fourth july " , great movie ) telling his own experience going war . very beginning we see everything military they don't show when they recruiting ( ugly painful true war ) . movie goes until you see absolutely everybody completely nuts , doing drugs , killing randomly , even killing each other . this waht war men . you not human anymore . movie obviously rated violence , there some very tough scenes make anybody cry . toughest my opinion one village , when they kill -among others- mentally retarded ( course harmless ) young guy , woman . then they set village fire , rape some women , get away it . whole cast excellent , specially dafoe , who my opinion nails his character . dvd comes excellent terrific documentary called " tour inferno " ( 30 minutes long ) film stone , dafoe , depp , etc . talking movie . there also commentary stone captain there . this movie should mandatory all high schools america . if there no soldiers , there would no wars , war iraq looks lot like war vietnam . usa making same mistake again , government so blind see ( or maybe they don't care people , just business all weapons ' companies -bush ' frieds- making out it ! ) . but let smart , let just ignore government . they always get their way . let smart close all rotc programs schools . how we so hypocrites those programs schools ? education we really think our children deserve ? not happen any other place world , not even cuba . let invest money education . real education . how many trilion dollars bush wasted iraq so far ? how much money government invest education ? health ? people who live work america ? parents : teach your children . nobody should join army . let politicians -real leaders , not bunch idiots we today spread all over planet- job , we'll see how many would go . let commander chief go war himself . there no question it : there would no war . they wouldn't go . they would try negotiate , try solve conflicts peacefully . again , this great movie everybody should watch . masterpiece just not , but also makes us think , educates us . everybody should ask themselves : war ... it worth it ? what ...	1

requiem darkness far your average anime . this statement , vague but poignant , well describe essence series . it isn't normal . it delves into human psyche deranged supernatural ways , all honesty , probably shouldn't viewed anyone under age 16 . if made into movie , rating would more than deserved . but here i am , 13 years old , after watching show i'm still alive kicking . basically , if you're squeamish , requiem darkness may bother you times . satoshi kon masterpiece tends some pretty graphic stuff its openings-case point , one introduction depicts grotesque obese man rigorously chomping what could very well slabs human flesh-another shows seven women burned stakes , blood running their eyes . all fairness , those two worst cases , main body episodes usually don't contain anything close such violence . point you don't want giving this your eight year old . i've talked violence , so i feel obligated tell sexual aspects show . firstly , there very little-to-no nudity . if memory serves , there no topless scenes . not say there not sexually inappropriate episodes . one episode devoted largely scandalous sexual relationship father his ( notably over 18 ) daughter . there , well , " motions " couple flicks tongue shone . very last episode shadow woman raped depicted . so , understand first if you're too young make amazon account than you most definitely shouldn't watching this show . now , moving . while there ongoing plot , requiem darkness largely episodic till last few shows . each episode independent , singularly brilliant , entity itself . writing storytelling simply amazing , plot lulling you into trance capable rushing you forward any moment . tale usually unfolds you follow main character , author looking stories write his book " 100 ghost stories . " author gets tied affairs three supernatural exorcists , who find ( eventually ) murder excessively sinful souls . exorcists seem always know what going , while author put together facts like detective realize often strange obscure situations going around him . resulting rhythm story , simply , magnificent . if anything drawback series , it animation . many people criticize its looks , i can't blame them . art isn't particularly well . it stylistic , way i think good show . only main characters detailed faces , crowds onlookers strange , almost inhuman looking complexions . environments often warped-perhaps not fully color , or bowing like someone bent them inward . some people might think these effects bad thing . i'm personally indifferent . i'd go discussing requiem darkness , but-lo ! life harsh . if you're age , get this show . you'll not regret it .	1

jason reitman makes impressive debut director this entertaining comedy `thank you smoking , ' which more satirical than any comedies his father ivan reitman made . despite film plot one nick naylor , ace spokesperson tobacco industry , `thank you smoking ' refuses take sides while keeping us hugely entertained its dialogues . aaron eckhart delivers superb performance nick naylor , chief spokesman lobbyist tobacco industry , who his `spin ' mode easily manipulate opinions suspicious audiences tv show . nick also good father his son joey ( cameron bright ) , before whom nick tries role model . today nick thinks brilliant idea production placement - how showing hollywood stars smoking spaceship ? - he flies california his son , meets suave movie producer wearing kimono ( rob lowe ) , his free time delivers package ailing old man ( sam elliott ) who sue tobacco company . satire funny , but its target changes frequently . it could tobacco industry ( why not ) , but also could those politicians ( represented william . macy senator ) who seems very hostile nick , nick himself . sometimes story goes too far , which includes brief episode abduction , but it most effective when it shows nick darkly funny conversations his friends , lobbyists alcohol guns ( mari bello david koechner , calling themselves mod squad ) over their lunch . other cast includes robert duvall , adam brody , kim dickens , . . simmons , katie holmes . acting unanimously good , but film belongs eckhart nick naylor , or his art spin . film may lack thought-provoking ideas on-going social issues . still what you see `thank you smoking ' always amusing , clever , even absurdly funny , never boring	1
imagine you found out you going die few months . what would you ? what would you decide mattered you ? what would you think you accomplished ? what would you consider left unaccomplished ? what would you want your legacy ? those questions facing centeral character akira kurosawa ikiru ( meaning " live " ) . brilliant actor takashi shimura plays role kanji watanabe , midlevel bureaucrat who spent his entire career doing little more than protecting his own job looking busy while actually accomplishing little . one day this man learns he terminal cancer soon die . this revelation makes him start reviewing his life , he concludes he nothing worthwhile . he tries " live it up " newfound friends loose women , but this not fulfill him . he cannot bring himself tell his own son daughter-in-law his fate ; caught up their own petty problems , they seem little time old man . eventually he meet kind kindred spirit , worker bureaucracy who quitting her job because she too feels she doing nothing useful . but even she cannot help this poor man who needs love , fulfillment , sense purpose . so watanabe finds his own reason go through his final days , reason centered around doing genuine good , regardless chance reward . after he dies glory all goes lesser bureaucrats who , while previously fighting him every step way , now bask spotlight claim glory , paying him much lip service while denying him true honor . normally i don't give so detailed plot description , but i've so here two reasons : 1 ) few people , particularly america , seen or even heard this movie , 2 ) i want point out how universal themes , how this movie could easily remade today any other country any other culture any other cast . while watching ikiru i kept thinking good modern title might , " more things change more they stay same . " like so many kurosawa films , this movie , though black white old , feels completely contemporary its concerns its content . while much made kurosawa concern japanese conflict collective individual , issues ikiru resonates any culture , not just japan . these bureacrats sound like bureaucrats which we all familiar . this very deep film , filled themes existentialism movies rarely tackle . it asks biggest questions asked life . same time , it never feels pretentious or preachy . story complex , not terms plot twists , but terms its " inner life . " yet running time two hours 23 minutes , ikiru moves very quickly , feeling faster than typical 90-minute hollywood film . this probably because there lots ground cover , also because effortless acting . takashi shimura performance watanabe one greatest cinema . though shimura not widely known west , he one japan major actors 1950s 60s , kurosawa worked him often . see him kurosawa seven samuri , made just two years after this film , completely different performance , one swagger bravado . other cast members also outstanding , especially miki odagiri young female coworker . she too feels straitjacketed her job government paper-pusher , but she young not tied down responsibility so she leaves . sort date watanabe she confides she humorous names everyone department based how they behave , his " mummy . " rather than offended , he agrees her this insight helps shape his vision himself what he must redeemed . it hard believe same director who made such beautifully-composed samurai films also could direct contemporary dramas look effortless this . yet film , or third act it , also reminded me very different motion picture -- citizen kane , believe it or not . while stylistically two masterpieces little common , both deal man , recently dead , who pieced together those who knew him partially . they try make sense his actions without ever getting full picture , while we , omniscent audience , . they misunderstand his actions , ascribe many selfishness when they actually exactly opposite . ( often kane reverse true . ) only difference while watanabe fundamentally sympathetic character , kane not . also , kurosawa manages tell his story without flashy technique or set pieces . ikiru also strangely foreshadows life real japanese hero second part 20th century , yutaka katayama ( or " mr. , " he called many ) . katayama head nissan motor west coast division north america 1960s 70s . he brought task when nissan piddly carmaker no consequence , especially north america , which then ruled big , powerful ford gm cars . though katayama not motivated thought his impending death , he hard-working wanted succeed america , which he through steady , unflagging determination . but he also went against grain japanese business protocol , encountered wrath his superiors tokyo . ironically , more successful he became , more he resented . ( his far less aggressive successful counterpart east coast more highly regarded japanese bosses . ) after establishing nissan major player america , katayama unceremoniously retired superiors moved took credit his work . he died obscurity , but today mr. revered figure nissan , even used advertising campaign several years ago . executives now dislocate their jaws praising him . it all sounds too familiar . second dvd two features , 90 minute documentary kurosawa own production company his working methods , wherein he discusses everything writing scripts editing final product ; 40-minute feature making ikiru , cast crew interviews . both docs excellent you watch ikiru more intelligence after you see them . there also film trailer commentary track which i confess i haven't time listen . it stephen prince , author warrior camera : cinema akira kurosawa . criterion once again standard which all dvd makers should aspiring . print , while scratched battered bit age , good we're likely see . it unfortunate many years kurosawa work not better taken care . like nissan mr. , he without honor his own country , because he considered " too western " his outlook . like mr. , his name now evokes nothing but praise his homeland . fortunately , work this " mr. " finally preserved . ikiru film you should investigate even if you've never seen japanese movie before , even if you've never heard akira kurosawa , even if you " hate " foreign or black white films , even if you think you no interest subject . because subject fact very modern universal , you quickly swept away relevance story . ikiru very dictionary definition term " timeless classic .	1

it must made huge difference me i saw movie before i read book - i 3 little girls - based some other reviews this movie . i really enjoyed movie ( my girls - they watch it over over ) . it just fun sweet . i really enjoyed " modern " comic spin fairy tale , medieval setting . i couldn't wait read book . i admit i little bit confused when storyline turned out different , but i continued read i really started appreciate common themes movie book - how they'd chosen portray them movie . i also appreciated book its own . i glad it different movie . it same yet different way made it fun read . i didn't already know how everything going go or how it would end - except general " happy ending " sense . after reading book i could also understand why they chose put story screen way they . my perspective anyway , i think put it onscreen exactly book would taken some magic out it . it definitely magical just right book but movie i really think it would come across cliche - just telling cinderella story . instead , movie honored themes book while stepping things up screen - spinning story differently making them bigger than life/outlandish ( if you ) . highly entertaining i'd recommend book movie anyone - especially if you little girls . just remember - get best out both - watch film first	1

after reading very positive reveiws this late 90 thriller i decided it deserved least rental . i must confess i am glad i happened stumble upon this movie amazon because it everything horror movie should . screenplay very put together , plot setting intriguing yet mysterious killings ( or cinematography if you want make it sound all fancy ) visuals quite impressive it 500,000 $ dollar budget . now , only real complaint i say film acting horrid . now dont get me wrong not all acting bad but i would lying if i said most actors okay , truth most them very little experience made film look all-around quite bit less professional hard look elite horror film . i think if producers would known when they made film it would so well such great reveiws number veiwers than they would more than willing dish out few extra bucks order some more experienced actors . i thought david hewlett played david worth ( architect ) acceptably i also thought nicky guadagni performance helen halloway ( doctor ) pretty good . other than those two i thought acting very lightweight . guy played quentin ( cop ) really bad which quite shame just because characte big role film really important ... also i thought they could gotten better more experienced guy play role autistic boy ( or man it some what hard tell ... ) . i know i keep going acting but i cant wonder away truth much . concept idea film really quite brilliant , screnplay brilliantly written story line meshed extrodinary ease . despite acting i heavily impressed film overall very good . grade : b+	1

you remember 2000 election ? well , you probably , well , if you're looking this dvd first place , you probably remember feeling angst one way or those days post-2000 election night . well , greenwald doesn't attempt spurn those feelings ; instead , he shows why decisively both sides aisle ( but admittedly more anti-republican focus ) , 2000 election farcical debacle . this one many dvd come out after election , but greenwald films appreciativeness speed , accuracy , quality , which many frankly lack . critical sources consisting authors , florida community leaders , many other people add their two cents this film give even more depth credibility . even danny glover takes role ' conductor ' if you , through least bit film . overall though , film cut quick it needed , should remind us not what wrong our voting system , although it plent . but what we make it better , why fight voting rights ever eventful fight	1

much written miscasting john travolta bill clinton this movie . not much written emma thompson casting . arguably , emma thompson , star movie versions jane austen stories , would just badly suited hillary role travolta bill . hillary raised suburban chicago , no apparent ties england , far genteel , reputation . however , emma wonderful hillary ; fact , since trashing bill clinton little further purpose , hillary-watching promises much more fun future . so who hillary seen not only writers but also emma thompson ? she compassionate , calculating , flawed , hyper-intelligent individual . she , written movie , " more moral " than bill so far observing code personal conduct , but " less moral " politics . movie would it , she would hesitate lot less than bill using relatively brutal political tactics . she shows great willingness externalize her feelings , accepts very little personal responsibility . like so many us , she sees where noble ends might justify means , expects others around her same . this remarkable performance . hillary star continues rise future ( it almost certainly ) , this movie might become sort emotional lynchpin understanding very complex very fascinating person	1

" fog " fairly typical representative john carpenter movie . it certainly its moments , yet it leaves viewer unmistakable feeling " what might . " this sense it reminds me bit michael mann 1985 version . paul wilson " keep " , fascinating yet flawed horror movie which i watch over over again vain hopes discovering it actually good . stripped bone , " fog " story small new england fishing town which celebrate its centennial ( or bicentennial .... or anniversary some type ) . eve this occasion local priest , drunken sot played hal holbrook , discovers town - like all horror movie small towns - terrible secret linked its founding . this discovery coincides appearance nasty fog off coast which tends leave dead people its wake , moving towards town . various characters town , including local beer-guzzler ( tom atkins ) nubile hitch-hiker ( jamie lee curtis ) radio deejay ( adrienne barbeau ) so , all isolated fog soon discover what inside it , how it related " terrible secret " , old sin which modern-day townsfolk mist pay . you see , while idea not exactly new it pretty cool , when i popped " fog " into my ancient dvd player recently i so after hiatus many years , hope my earlier judgement film wrong . this i disappointed . like " keep " , " fog " never gets any better ; unlike " keep " it actually gets worse . paper this should not happened . besides carpenter , who coming off well-received efforts like " assault precinct 13 " " halloween " there impressive cast actors which actually reunites good bit original " halloween " crew . besides carptenter jamie lee curtis , there also girl who played annie ( michael first onscreen victim ) , well guy who played sheriff both h-2 . replacing ubiquitous donald pleasance hal halbrook , venerable john houseman makes appearance film opening creepy , storytellin ' sea captain . even janet leigh involved , bitchy yet rather likable wife fog victim . ironically , tis part film problem , it many . first off , there far too many characters . film cluttered them some reason carpenter disobeyed standard horror movie order whittling them down film progresses . most victims throwaways no way integral plot , nearly everybody introduced beginning still walking around end . we needed more killings , not less . second , performances . this movie good actors , but dialogue best inconsistent worst embarrassingly stupid . worst it ladeled onto adrienne barbeau , who gets repeat idiocies like , " my son trapped ! trapped fog ! " " look out , into darkness .... beware fog ! " gag . third , villain(s ) . carptenter achieved some neatly creepy atmosphere beginning film , but he never delivers it : there no real payoff . this because he couldn't seem decide whether it fog itself or what fog actual " baddie " film . result no one antagonist ever really emerges . " fog " might well run o ' mill flood - faceless impersonal . movie its moments -- creepy opening , moments atmospheric horror sea , excellent cinematography , which used particular effect creepy fog-dwellers . but end these fail outweigh movie many flaws . today , i still regard carptenter most wildly inconsistent director out there . one hand he gave us p-13 , halloween , escape new york , thing , all classics ( cult or otherwise ) . other hand he also gave us crap like prince darkness unwatchable ghosts mars . there fun but flawed outings like they live mouth madness . i would like say fog falls this last category , but i really can't . it just isn't very good , that sad fact it . bottom line ? beware fog .	-1

' vanishing ' reminds me woody allen film ' match point ' which i also watched recently , they're both thrillers which approach their subject matter very flat , realistic non-sensationalistic manner . creating outlandish criminals schemes rushing over them so we don't notice how absurd they standard thriller formula . these films , however , take relatively simple believable acts violence examine them depth . sense , they're opposite thrillers , slow deliberate , all building up finale which proves surprisingly affecting , certainly more affecting than traditional thriller climax . unlike most people here , i won't tell you this method necessarily better or smarter . they both work very well , `the vanishing ' this more methodical approach quite well . film opens introducing us rex saskia , dutch couple vacation france . we get know them fairly slowly , they're obviously very affectionate , prove much more believable appealing couple than you'd usually find film . before too long they stop gas station saskia heads off get them something drink . she never comes back . rex becomes obsessed , continually investigates , putting up posters flyers . he this three years , he knows very well saskia must dead . nevertheless , he can't move ; he must know what happened her . this isn't single perspective film , however . we also introduced , quite early , raymond lemorne , man who abducted saskia . he doesn't seem like killer type , he apparently quite balanced family man . he seems go through plan intellectual experiment more than any thing else . he it ? he get away it ? raymond quite impressed rex persistence , he even contacts rex via postcard , leading their eventual meeting film grimly inevitable climax . again , this film very low-key . there almost no on-screen violence , my recollection , not even much strong emotion or yelling . they all almost always manage keep lid it . sluizer shot film very straight forward manner . he rarely makes any sort comment camera , but simply records what going . it doesn't conventional plot arc either , no traditional rising action or raising stakes or what you . it everyday life sort approach , approach which refuses shape story into standard movie plot form . nevertheless , it draws you , making you * need * know what happened , just rex . this film greatest supporters love tell you how intelligent this movie , but i'm not sure if i really buy argument . it not dumb movie , certainly , but there really isn't all much it intellectual standpoint . it touches themes predestination obsession so , but that nothing particularly new or remarkable this way . it require patience just different most films , which doubtless throw some dullards , but while capacity patience taste different tend go hand hand intelligence they really aren't same thing . this all say , i think stupid people tend not like this movie , but not because they don't understand it . it just not their thing . `the vanishing ' cleverly structured , though , shifting perspectives , first showing us crime rex perspective , then raymond , slowly revealing information film goes . however , i think it bit too drawn out middle , showing raymond contemplation rex rex endless attempts solve crime bit too long . beyond this , rex confrontation raymond isn't interesting it might . this point we've learned almost everything there know , so some it proves bit reiterative . still , ending packs punch , doubtless made more effective occasional slight dullness other parts film . performances surprisingly good film this cheap . mentioned before , saskia rex very likable , not movie couple all . gene bervoet performance rex probably key film . if you don't sympathize him there isn't much pull you into film emotionally . ( i , so i . ) donnadieu raymond psycho like few others i've seen film . he intellectual villain , which isn't rare , but he different because his intellectualism isn't cover madness lying underneath . he just so coldly logical detached , confessed sociopath , madness doesn't even describe his condition . he barely even human . hmm , guess that it . again , i don't think this quite masterpiece some . it still bit slow dry times , but characters intriguing enough structuring clever enough carry it . ( , again , ending quite good . ) definitely worth look if you want see different sort thriller . grade :	1

" koma " surprisingly suspenseful film . while there enough gore certainly warrant horror flick categorization , director chi-leung law delivers very old school hitchcock suspense tale . close-ups objects like foot dragging across floor leaving bloodstained trail heighten suspense move story . angelica lee fung chi-ching , girl who needs new kidney inhibitions keep her fully embracing her boyfriend , good job hits many levels hysteria jealousy drunken delirium . andy hui who plays her boyfriend , dr. tsui wai-man , hits number levels also guy love man whose hormones outpace his common sense . researcher suen ling , karena lam projects person who difficult upbringing frequently not walks shady side street . twists plot trace kidney thief who black-markets organs $ 60,000 pop never leaves you quite settled until final frame . subtitled chinese dialog often sparsely verbal picture translates well international audience . " koma " turns out pleasant , often intelligent , surprise . enjoy !	1
many students who attend new york city public schools , education often takes back seat daily struggles brought poverty , language barriers broken homes . it small wonder , then , so many students drop out school , turn gangs drugs , lose all hope bright , productive future . attempt circumvent scenario give its children viable reason staying school , district implemented program introduces all 5th graders fine art ballroom dancing . after year training , best dancers go compete citywide competition , many these kids , represents one truly positive influence their lives . rapturous documentary " mad hot ballroom " tribute program . director marilyn agrelo focused three schools , two manhattan one brooklyn , where program full swing . most film spent chronicling efforts part teachers students get ready competition . however , movie also offers generous collection clips showing children their off-school hours , home or local hangouts . kids not shy opening up camera they comment all aspects their lives , revealing their street smarts their refreshingly candid , canny thoughtful assessments world around them . competition increases , kids learn little something , too , thrill victory agony defea t.t he filmmaking style - which alternates interviews scenes children dancing - straightforward relatively conventional , but subject matter so compelling its own right any attempt part filmmakers fancy it up would most likely detracted movie overall value instructional document . if there flaw film , it movie isn't successful differentiating individual participants , say , " spellbound , " movie spelling bees which took great pains zero specific children throughout course film , end result we really felt we got know them people . " ballroom , " however , kids , adorable they , come across more part herd than collection clearly delineated individuals . but scenes centered competition filled suspense , emotion high drama those " spellbound .

so many movies getting realesed dvd why not this one . this forgotten 80s gem needs dvd if they put moving violations out why not this ?!!	1
this film definitely not masterpiece . i found it incredibly dry incomprehensibly over-rated . yes , film bleak but inexplicably bleak . make matters worse , main character seems resolve her numbness almost out nowhere . perhaps i missed something gigantic because i trying not fall asleep while watching this drag but i would not attempt see it again . however , there couple memorable scenes . i would strongly advise renting it before purchase . some people love film but i don't understand why	-1
looking forward watching this movie . rated pervasive strong language drug use , brutal fight	1

since " pianist " many roman polanski earlier movies undergoing reappraisal this should no exception . reviled time its innovative use " shocking " images linked most unfortunately charles manson/ sharon stone murder , it slumbered basement many years . today it seen perhaps first time what it : extremely subtle complex analysis way powerful organisations deform mind " ordinary " people/ or , if you prefer it , psychosis gradually take grip most normal individuals . this case organisation witches ' coven but film also seen other religious/ political overtones . particularly clever way director keeps us guessing throughout what extent rosemary ( mia farrow ) deluded her " paranoid " belief her husband neighbors plotting against her her unborn child . yes , i know , put way it sounds pretty clear cut case , but such rosemary naive honesty ( despite criticism i feel mia farrow inspired choice this film ) we continue believe , against all odds , she innocent victim . polanski staunchly refused throughout film indulge gratuitous " horror film " excesses . there no vomiting final scene which rosemary first time sees her " demonic " baby positively shakespearean its restraint , baby merely described characters ( you imagine ) opposed seen . throughout this film it mind rather than stomach working . it great movie well worth revisiting . certainly i could not see any modern director remaking it successfully . true piece kafka	1
" fast firm lower body sculpt 1 " originally part body sculpting system 1 6-pack add-on videos . it uses fanny lifter three pairs dumbbells -- they generally recommend 3 , 5 , 8 pound dumbbells . i really feel like this video takes shows off some trademark firm moves superior fashion . you haven't experienced leg press until you've what feels like eleventy zillion them this workout . lisa also sets modified dips she calls " curtsey dips , " which you holding weights curtseying -- they make you feel muscles your hips serious way ! once you get stronger , this workout really benefits " heavying up " places . when i really want feel burn , i'll set or two leg presses squats 15 pounders when lisa kay calls heavy dumbbells . some people complain workouts body sculpting system 1 boring -- plain , uninteresting sets , boring choreography , etc etc . sets plain , i would describe choreography throughout series " utilitarian , " but i think it works viewer advantage , especially lbs1 . modifier beginners easy see follow , exercises simple but effective , user doesn't get distracted complicated footwork or strange camera angles lighting . this awesome lower body workout really stands its own among other bss1 workouts . if you really want work muscles your lower body feel it awhile afterwards , lower body sculpt 1 job	1

i said , this entertaining , all it intended . if you want complete accuracy , this isn't movie you . people events loosely based those actually existed ( " tarington " lt . col . banastre tarleton , who pretty close but not quite equal violence scale . ) . some reviewers seem upset this one-sided , melodramatic fictional story ; but i only looking good movie watch . since it hollywood production , i expected some artistic license . when i want actual facts i get out my textbooks university , not mel gibson dvd	1

i would rate show 5 stars , this review extras features special edition issue . i recently bought all special edition releases " stand alone complex " after trying research what i going get extras not included regular edition . i found listings amazon product details little confusing incomplete some volumes so i decided write this guide others trying decide . i'm not going review " ghost shell " episodes or series general because there so many excellent reviews already this site , most you probably know this great anime tv series already . there various other reviews say some dvd cd errors them bandai replace them corrected discs if you send them exchange . i not ran into problems yet , although i haven't gone through whole series either . i also state i love tv series well both movies , but i would recommend imported region 2 version gits2 : innocence if you region free dvd player . dreamworks really messed up release omiting english dub putting hard hearing subtitles instead regular ones early issues movie . most people find them very distracting annoying . first off discs themselves , you get two dvd discs each volume same episodes both discs . volumes 1-5 4 episodes each , 6 7 3 episodes each making 26 episodes total series . both discs anamorphic wide screen encoded directly high-definition masters . both discs also english subtitles . each set also two interviews voice cast or someone associated production anime , printed dvd insert pamphlet or booklet different interviews such each volume . all discs region 1 . disc one dolby digital 5.1 japanese english , dolby digital 2.0 english japanese . disc two dts 5.1 english japanese dolby digital 2.0 english track . volumes 1 2 include soundtrack cd music yoko kanno , most excellent versatile composer music tv series . anime lovers know her work many fine soundtracks she countless other anime movies tv series . volume 3 black xl fruit loom tee-shirt section 9 logo front major kusanagi graphic back . nice shirt ! volumes 4 5 collectable i.d. cards section 9 member . volume 6 black xl fruit loom tee-shirt section 9 logo front batou graphic back , i.d. card . nice shirt again ! volume 7 tee-shirt ! this time it white xl section 9 logo front , laughing man logo back ! once again nice shirt ! it also comes tin box that supposed hold all 7 volumes dvd set . i excited getting box but when it arrived i disappointed design . it kind like rectangular lunch box you used take school kid , without handle latch . its also thinner metal dents easily . it marketing type printing backside pertains vol . 7 only , dvd cases stack inside one top other . spines cases not visible when you open box , only front last case you put . so you take all cases out tin get specific volume . there also not room cardboard sleves dvd when you got individual volumes , no room soundtrack cd either . all said , i disappointed box . because it odd dimensions it doesn't stack well my dvd library . i would much preferred normal five sided box usually comes dvd sets . overall i'd say it worth it buy volumes 3 , 6 7 new get shirts if they interest you pick up others used if you save some money series . if you're interested dts soundtrack options . i much prefer dts mixes dolby digital wanted soundtrack cd well . also cardboard boxes come volumes 3 6 better than tin box store your set when you complete series , if you stack them shelves one row dvd top row , you fit movies into those boxes well fill them rest way	1

this good production useful critique da vinci code . program presents some credible investigation into supposed facts behind da vinci code . robinson his best discredit some issues raised holy blood , holy grail da vinci code . this well made documentary where robinson presents his arguments , proposals conclusions based available evidence compares contrast claims arguments presented dan brown . i liked his methodical approach convincing particularly scholarly way he exposes priory de sion hoax not some medieval secret society . much his credit , tony robinson not approach investigation religious view , giving his finding much objectivity . this worthwhile film those who seeking more thoroughly investigated refutation dan brown claims arguments , although it not very conclusive definitive rebuttal , due some omissions film . very good viewing open minded .	1

honest , i loved japanese original this movie so much my first watching american version little tainted . but i just watched richard gere version again , this time dvd , found i really like it more than i realized . gere so winsome ( i'll pay watch him dance any day , he aging gorgeously ! ) , lopez so elegant , all other characters so interesting , music so sexy , why quibble over which movie better ? this story entertaining touching its own right , even if not nuanced heartfelt japaese version . i watched ballroom dancing competitions years , this film conveys romance excitement draws people those competitions . story charming , adult pg satisfying ending -- how rare combination these days ? dvd offers good insights into ballroom training hard work behind movie , well wonderful " sway " music video . which reminds me -- soundtrack excellent , i bought , too .	1

well , i'd agree tweedle " fan service " pencil cards over top , but only because they inconsistent characters series . series very good character development , lots good back story early . only " fan service " episode " heart darkness " , which shows bare chested woman , but she not one main characters . it doesn't seem very provocative me , since there no emphasis sex , character only trying keep her clothes dry . still , this feels like " filler " episode , doesn't really contribute story . plot inconsistent seasons . heart darkness , girls search ancient key books , but episode 14 ( set up second season ) , we find books not ancient ... i like art this series , it hand drawn feel it , lots attention detail . i'd definitely buy it again	1
i've devoted pilates practicer over 6 years , somewhat sceptical any kind workout tried turn classic pilates into more aerobic-type exercise . still , i ellen barrett dvd ( self sleek slim ) liked both workout instructor ( she extremely personable impeccable cueing ) , so i thought i would give this dvd go . i'm very happy report i love it . i think ellen excellent job applying pilates exercises standing mat workout makes you sweat . i love feeling simultaneously stretching stengthening my body while also burning fat . even though routine moves relatively slow pace , other reviewers pointed out , use weights really gets your heart going . i'd rather move steady pace moves properly ( that pilates principle ! ) than flail around frantic speed , case so many workouts . many people seem think unless it really fast paced , you're not getting good workout -- that totally wrong . i should add i've always found weight training boring avoided it , so i'm very happy found way incorporate some into my workout . i also think people no pilates background probably just fine this dvd , but you'd probably get more out it even some rudimentary instruction pilates . i would recommend stott videos ( also all excellent ) starting beginner pilates mat workout . i work out 4-5 times week , using this dvd least 2 times week 6 weeks now . i still look forward it . highly highly recommended .	1
this movie one greatest war movies ever . not over- statement . if you any interest ww2 want see what it really like eastern front brutal stalingrad russia , then this movie see . it feels real complete mightmare , but you ; take your eyes off screen . its like great novel , visual intensity . acting directing this german film top shelf . its almost like they don't know cameras rolling , it really 1940 russia . it starts off so well germans , we see them celebrating rare day off horrors war italy . they fresh off victory north africa deployed russia take over vital supply line stalingrad affords its russian forces . soon fighting begins horror takes ahold german platoon . you see looks their faces scene after scene , when they begin realize this one battle not going victorious . further hamper grim reality their surroundings winter soon takes icy grip unit well beginning hatred their superior officers . this one interesting aspects this film . they seem hate officers much their enemy . officers lose command control platoon , they try deperately intimidate men see things " fuhrer way " . cold ominous , this film exact feeling you would expect this battle , circumstance . 5 stars - probably best war film all time .	1

this very underrated movie . hollywood courtroom drama manages almost totally avoid clich� ...? one scrapbook maybe . what i liked most it almost complete lack explanation motivation ( shades david lynch here perhaps ) most notably schlichtmann character , brilliantly underplayed john travolta . who could ever imagined said ? indeed all top stars (+duvall , macy , shaloub ) rein histrionics , which one reason why you watch this . what really made him change typical materialistic lawyer into people hero willing risk everything , well , you make your mind up ? word hero out place here , however , perhaps more disturbingly also so villain , film deal terrible crime . but then perhaps banality crime what it all . or should . whatever your view , you not go away without thinking some very searching questions concerning relationship law , justice human suffering . film ends perhaps one finest pauses cinema , travolta , faced bankruptcy , attempts vain answer judge question : where it all go ? see it	1
i only worked one office month i relate lot things this movie : printer barely worked times , overdemanding boss , rules regulations feeling any kind profit you're not going see dime it . unlike certain comedy movies which based primarily disgusting , rude or people getting smacked things , office space gets its laughs moments where you go " i know someone exactly like " . peter 2 friends work initech , computer company prides itself making workers what they've told . after hypnotherapy session , peter becomes carefree uninhibited but he gets promotion . how get back them ? put virus computer system takes remainders transactions puts them separate account . they get caught ? one great things this movie it seems take itself seriously while fun same time . while there no big comedy punchlines , film quite funny certain personas we've met such slooow tallllking guy ... mmkay ? or bosses restaurants making demands while saying it up you if you want it but i'm gonna whine if you don't . acting-wise film straight across board . while i only know 3 cast members(obviously jennifer aniston others dave herman , voice actor futurama john . mcginley ) , everyone perfect their roles even spout some great one-liners too . my favorite : neighbor , overhearing peter plan gone awry , declines offer visit peter saying " that ok , don't want you **** up my life too . " only thing i didn't like character you're going love hate never gets comeuppance , like somebody losing it punching him . kind disappointing . how skimpy extras . this " special edition " practically one making-of deleted scenes dvd-rom stuff . no commentary ? grr , which too bad cause i would've loved hear least anybody but still this film definately warrants purchase	1

i missed reading this child . when i went read reviews it amazon determine which copy purchase my nieces , all i found movie reviews . totally unhelpful ! so , my comments book , secret garden , illustrated michael hague . ( addition i read our local library currently out print , but our librarian recommended one illustrated tasha tudor which print . ) its beautifully written its wonderful read-a-loud . use english language just lovely refreshingly old-fashioned . its got drama mystery but nothing especially scary . it easily one best children books i've ever read ( currently i'm huge harry potter fan ) , though its less fantasy more self-empowerment . somewhere i read every little girl should read this book . i disagree . every child should read this book . i read it ( 2 sittings , it so mesmerizing ) now i've started read it my young sons . its real page-turner no swearing , no smart talking no violence/weapons some very important messages how treat yourself others . there lots great talking points whole family . every family should own copy	1

nick lachey jessica simpson few good moments nick jessica variety hour . but show looks too ' 70s its premise , too donny marie-ish some parts sonny cher-in some others . lachey performance babyface nice . how come babyface didn't produce nick entire solo album instead batch people nick went caused soul-o flop ? he would given him some smooth stuff sing . but mr. johnny bench kenny rogers makes show look , sadly , too 1983-ish . how come they couldn't get somebody current perform it , say maroon 5 or kanye west , who both hot last april ? they wanted bring back variety show format , but it very hard it internet age . jessica isn't all good this show . i'd rather hear her music albums instead . they need bring new things format if they're going make show . now , lachey simpson would better off doing their solo albums than wasteful junk like this !	-1

if you're looking documentary life truman capote , you two choices : * truman capote , ae dvd archives ( 2005 ) [ asin : b0009hmtfs ]; * great writers : truman capote ( 2000 ) [ asin : b000fc2hng]neither one inexpensive , so i would liked review saying which one better . it turned out , i ended up buying watching both . although both programs roughly same length , differences significan t.t he arts entertainment ( ) version clearly better . it more information , photographs , film footage , interesting interviews than great writers version , which seems trying make some sort artistic statement its own - lots pictures grass waving wind , country roads , etc ., none which terribly relevant . you better off buying program .	1
i hardly believe some reviews i'm reading here . it seems every one wants more foghorn leghorn , speedy gonzalez chuck jones . they want cartoons 50s . well , i've seen most wb cartoons over many long years , speedy gonzalezes stink ; forghorn leghorn funny once then boring ; chuck jones most overrated catroonist all times . he made some good cartoons -- matter fact , lot good cartoons -- but he made lot junk too , including some his most heralded ( like " some froggy evening " which obvious , coy not funny all . ) tashlin , avery , especially , clampett , rule . porky pig feat , ( horror horrors ! ) black white cartoon 40s ( horrors again ) may funniest cartoon ever made . clampett only director who could make bugs bunny cartoon where bugs goat still make it hilarious : falling hare best example . but my god ! that war time cartoon references a-cards gremlins its too much expect people today understand ! this set even includes what probably freleng best cartoon : she acrobat daughter , wicked send-up night movies : but , heavenly days ( little fibber mcgee molly lingo there ) there references newsreels lew lehr ( who dat ? ) leslie howard bette davis petrified forest . lot reviewers here , i'm sure , offended inclusion anything so obscure this new millenium . " thugs dirty mugs " , there joke fred allen ; " gruesome twosome " , greatest cartoons ever , there parody jimmy durante ! it seems it asking too much expect anyone post baby boom understand anything happened before television age . i liked this set reason most reviewers here disliked it : because its concentration funnier , better written , more satirical cartoons pre-jones age . black white looney tunes terrific . i agree one other reviewers , though , i'd like see some tex avery travelogue spoofs . they hilarious collections corniest gags imaginable . pc stuff--it intolerable , but we just tolerate it . these fascists control this country now ( i don't mean since recent election -- it happened way before ) we just put up it . it just curious they think we should offended some stereotypes not others . stereotypes black americans shuddered but -- why , durante spoof take off italian american ; edward . robinson spoof " thugs dirty mugs " take off jewish american . finger shaking lecture old tradition this country only thing changes what we get lectured . thing never changes hypocrisy selective morality . other reviewers here , who probably favor pc fascism ( i've read few them ) make usual , unimaginative lame accusations : we don't like pc lecturing because we're all racists . fact i don't care what lecture . i resent fact lecture all . we turn these dvds entertainment , not any lecture how evil our ancestors . if there religious lectures beginning dvds modern movies , which may offend church goers , i'm sure pinkos would crab -- rightly so . it presence not content lecture offensive . but folks , just learn take it . it ain't going away . remember , no one really against censorship folks crab most it only crab because they're not censors they're not ones deciding what gets approves . right now what generally called " left " censors our culture it their version morality decides what we see enjoy what we lectured . get used it . but pc garbage what made me give this only 4 stars instead five it deserves	1
indeed 3d effects this film make you feel if you motion simulator times it very cool experience 3d fanatic like myself . i wasn't enamored music some other reviewers here but it wasn't bad . it need bit more humor harry shearer ( simpsons , spinal tap ) work but it cool goth looking fun kids except maybe very young ones . you need standard tube set make it work included system but rumor it version lcd projectors systems not far off . untill then this best we got . dukey flyswatte	1

folks , this movie alright , it not bad . probably best-worded review i've read " ken park " so far imdb . com . i think someone named " peedur " wrote it or something . not i agree him 100% , but good taken out this film well expressed his critique . look , fcc mpaa , you don't want me see something , then chrissake don't ban it . just makes me want watch it even more . all honesty , i don't know if this film should banned here america . " kids " " bully " made it through okay , even into theaters . when it comes teens sexuality , " ken park " might clark most truthful presentation it . now i know that gonna send many parents tearing their hair out , screaming , " what i ? how i save them this ? " well ... you can't . if you don't want believe any what happens " ken park " real , then you'd better just not watch it altogether . parents , heartbreaking truth almost all what happens here happened several times continue happen unabated . i've never lived visalia , ca , but spent ample time there . however , i born spent first 19 years my life fresno ( two remarkably similar close geographically ) . same stagnant lifestyle , same tendency listen punk hip-hop , same heat , etc . i appreciate clark effort humanize these kids this time ; none them what i would call " bad . " " kids " made kids look bad . " ken park " makes kids look bored , which what they really . don't scream heavens , asking why they would think such things , that nonsense . why they smoke dope , drink ad nauseum , jerk off frivolous sex ...? because there - - nothing - else - - - there . gotta alleviate boredom somehow . instance , when devout father scorns his daughter bible ... referring her beast whore ... nope , she just teenager . all teenagers beasts whores because you can't think any other label it . i personally sex supple young teenage filipino girls their parents ' catholicism-adorned house ? actually , right parents ' bed . i only 17 time . i've challenged my father fight , i've gotten impatient grandparents taking too long turn playing game , i've sat around living room watching mtv while hitting bong bitching how i couldn't wait leave wretched town . i've it ; it happens . never jerked off womens ' tennis while asphyxiating myself robe belt , but ... it areas like these clark starts lose me . there much more male nudity " ken park " than female , so don't expecting some wild teenaged orgy . there not even much actual sex movie . fact , if main characters this film but ... 4 years older ... i guarantee you this would not banned here america . visalia - never - looked good it " ken park " never again . it photographed directed two ace dps after all , so screen composition , lighting shading all luminous ... lack better adjective : warm . hospitable . film looks more expensive than it . my favorite scenes actually opening scene very final scene . without these strong bookends , i'd easily knock off half-star . i personally detest harmony korine ( kid just pretentious skater prick thinks he tarantino 12th power ) , however i like this script ... because it ripped right out headlines . parents , this not every teenager . it really not . but it lot them . " ken park " not seek illuminate teenaged psyche en masse , but offer examples what we think tragic squalid ... rather mundane existence . rather few exceptions " shock shock sake " scenes , it deserves more credit than it given . clark best film still " bully " , but " ken park " its merits . only those less discriminating tastes , obviously . tread lightly , but if you like your cinema ignore boundaries ( la miike takashi ) this one'll send you past envelope . 3.5 stars , but i'll round up audacity	1
liza timeless . enjoyed updates this concert always her music	1
first off , i am fan original series - escaflowne . it far up there top 5 favorite anime . it lot memorable characters , good action pretty decent story . this not original escaflowne . it not take part before or after series . it doesn't take place somewhere middle . it takes most main characters series totally retells entire story fit into movie . result ? not fan . basically , because entire movie you see 30 second introduction old characters suped up animation no depth . example , twin cat girls so fond lord falcon , show up instead brief 30 seconds singers stage bar . ummm yuck . lots more memorable characters subjugated this . perhaps , if you seen this first it would decent watch . myself , i very disappointed . good points this movie animation upgraded soundtrack well . even standalone product , movie no flow or depth it . it basically just compressed retelling escaflowne . i'd rent this skip it purchase . if you want purchase something , get escaflowne series . you much happier	-1
whole piece highly artistic tasteful . extra bonus wilby , grant graves all very pretty boys back those years . initially , wilby not most attractive one . but after watching it over over again , his charm getting irresistible . i haven't seen any wilby late performance australia . anyone knows how he doing uk ? sure he great actor but luck plays main role acting career . it comfort see him interview this special collection ( maybe shot 2003 ? ) - he still quite charming even though aged little . ageless classic can't recommend enough .	1
stars amazingthe plot quite interestingthe ending amazingthe whole movie just shocking how great it what it gets presentsi'm quite happy i this dvdit seen played more times when i play it my dvd player . keanu reeves morgan freeman bright their roles . amazing movie . even title movie made me wonder what movie really when i first put it my player	1
" legal eagles " supposed comedy . we're supposed find characters played robert redford debra winger amusing , their acrimonious relationship hilarious , way they end up partners despite all gibes romantically satisfying . problem movie too dumb taken seriously , thus too dumb funny . briefly , story takes place new york . robert redford assistant district attorney promoted da . debra winger defense attorney , daryl hannah young woman emotional problems , debra winger client . plot involves fire 20 years ago , when daryl hannah eight , fire killed her artist father purportedly destroyed large number his paintings . this experience left daryl hannah traumatized , but all not it seems , now , 20 years later , daryl hannah first accused attempted theft later murder . unfortunately , plot involves many elements simply don't make sense . i won't go into detail , but roger ebert good job listing four different major things make plot completely unbelievable . well story dumb i found some scenes supposed funny anything but . example , robert redford weekend father teenage daughter . one point his ex-wife threatens go court prevent him seeing their daughter . robert redford makes telephone call his ex-wife home starts angry monologue threats how he'll take her apart court . then he realizes he actually talking his daughter ! this mistake apparently supposed hilarious . ha , ha . scene robert redford debra winger together see one bad guys . robert redford takes off foot try catch him . debra winger , who doesn't know how drive car , feels it necessary her jump into robert redford car try follow him . she makes wrong turn finds herself going wrong way into traffic wide heavily trafficked street . there follows one minute her frantically dodging cars last moment . very funny . ha , ha , ha . this movie could fairly good romantic thriller if they fixed plot not tried comedy . but dumb plot unfunny attempts comedy make it complete waste time . rennie peterse	-1
i watched troll 2 showtime beyond(showtime horror/sci-fi movie channel ) like movie itself so bad it laughable ! i mean part where joshua screams out " your genius big sister " nearly made me fall out my chair laughingthe movie takes place small town where everyone veganand like religous people there phobia towards those who eat meat they " unpure " if they eat it which ironically saves johusa movie eating double decker sandwich meatthe goblins this movie creepy esspeically one bolding eyes eek ! anyway thoughout flim joshua looking pictures creepy looking trolls which ironic considering it golibinsanyway movie only way golibins eat someone eat something so they could eat them!i'm not child but still scary thought ! after watching this movie i didn't look green red same way again nor could i eat muchonly watch this movie if you looking laugh	-1
this one movie aged , not well . it great when it came out ( i remember seeing it just after premiere ziegfield nyc ) , but looking it some 30 years later , it just doesn't stand up test time . october 74 run great , deadheads thought it last . film meant immortalize band , so . however , jerry editing , which puts too much focus scene detriment music , turns movie into documentary , rather than concert film . but , disc 2 real saver . 90 minutes great tunes - only music - including other one , dark star , china/rider , great sugaree , this may one best filmed records dead . get it disc 2	1
tom clancy movies some best ever adapted novels . though all books least twice good their movies , films still great action movies watch . quot ; hunt red octoberquot ; great movie , john mctiernen best right next quot ;d ie hard . quot ; connery baldwin both very good it , story russian nuclear sub defecting usa still enjoyable though different book . end movie very exciting . quot ; patriot gamesquot ; features harrison ford taking over role jack ryan after alec baldwin decided not it again . this one probably best three . story ryan his family london when he stops attempted assassination members royal family , he turn hunted ultra violent left-wing faction ira . this pic very exciting , also featuring great climax . last one series quot ; clear present danger . quot ; now , this one wasn't even close half good book , it almost completely different . this my least favorite because book so damn good , but it still enjoyable movie . it operation run against colombian drug cartel also kept secret president . however , when group american officials brutally killed colombians ( which spectacular scene ) , course harrison ford there , operation shut down , leaving behind american soldiers colombia . ryan ( ford ) mr. clark ( willem dafoe ) go get remaining soldiers , climax movie isn't quite intense climax book . overall , this very good collection buy , i definitely recommend it	1
john hughes strikes gold this hit classic . this film five kids who show their high school saturday detention . while there , they open up each other express their feelings , putting up each other evading their wily principal(paul gleason ) . high-strung humor laughs blend superb storytelling breakfast club(starring judd nelson bender , molly ringwald claire , ally sheedy allison , anthony michael hall brian , emilio estevenz andrew)are hillarious ! pleasant all-around film	1
this dvd first season now-classic simpsons animated series , collects show first thirteen episodes . not much really needs said simpsons , it one biggest pop culture icons ever . however , you really tell these episodes series rough around edges when it started . character designs unrefined , animation crude rubbery . stories feel like typical sitcom plots little simpsons edginess zany humour tossed , but not nearly enough it . voice-actors also still getting into character here , so their performances also different what they later matured into . luckily , fox loaded first season dvd goodies , including commentaries every episode some other fun retrospective material . presentation really nice too some original packaging disc artwork . i'd say episodes themselves three stars , but superb box set treatment bumps overall score up four . if you're casual simpsons fan , season 2 much better place start watching , thats when memorable episodes really start coming . but hardcores , this set great buy , nice start your collection .	1
denzel washington probably my favorite actor . even dog movie called manchurian candidate , he shone . tom hanks ? well , lemme quit hating guy . this well-intentioned movie , tom creditable job , we extreme close-ups funny colors camouflage spots where he overreached . i also pleasantly surprised see antonio banderas fly face his latino studliness playing gay guy . passionate one , though , since he still latino , after all . actually , this hollywood " message movie , " you know what means . it subtle michael moore . those who agree message flock beaten head it two hours . those who filmmakers would like see movie , those who don't agree message , stay far away it possible . there scene library where nobody wants sit table aids boy . way they stared him reminded me " lao wei china " experiences . denzel character reminded segregation , even though he too young remember it , started care tom hanks ' character . aids discrimination bad . actually , any discrimination all bad . that movie message . i agree message , but still . that all we've got . totally irrelevant non-sequiter , if name " sam francisco " means anything you , you've seen subtle commentary discrimination . i love great courtroom drama . this one merely good . so much agenda squeeze into two-hour film , they take few shortcuts here . sad , ain't it ? but even so , well-intentioned film i'm glad i saw . once . not twice . once enough , thank you .	-1
... which more than i say modern couple . if you expect see gwyneth paltrow take her clothes off , don't bother this movie . she plays frigid arrogant scholar , which not too much stretch her . my opinion , she not romantic damsel-in-distress material . she much more interesting when she plays cold cynical characters . jennifer ehle , other hand , shows quite bit skin . clandestine love scene two poets still stands before my eyes . i read book , so i could tell movie left too many loose ends untied . instance , it not clear movie why gwyneth paltrow character crying .	1

these types movies becoming quite trend hollywood . fight club started it ( which awesome movie ) . then sixth sense ( which also pretty good ) . after , it all went downhill . brown bunny , machinist , others , hide seek , etc . surprise endings twist , characters don't exist only main characters imagination , daed characters don't know they dead . these movies all surprising audience already overused plot twists . i predicted john torturro character figment depp imagination within first 20-25 mins film . why would actor depp status take part movie this substance	-1
this great one ! very interesting well presented , it definitely give you goosebumps toward end !!	1
this movie true garbage . it made no sense , no real plot , not offer any clever deaths or humor , or gratuitous skin . ending leaves you feeling stupid watched it all way end . i wake myself up 3 times during this movie , i wish i just stayed asleep . horror , horror . actually , sheriff kind wierd creepy because you knew he not acting ( there no acting ) you worry someone like walking around out there . i think people who liked this movie trying sell their used copies good landfill only . basically , plot make some headway end , but then they ran out money or maybe their 486 computer they using edit it died . or maybe they got bored walked off set . becuase their no explanation who killed everyone , everyone except innocent girl dead . it chainsaw killing lots scythe beheading , but i just could not care . if i could give this movie negative stars i would , but 1 star lowest .	-1
if you're craving soapy queer fix now queer folk no longer lathering it up , then queer-noir private eye thriller third man out sure soothe your ache . plot may bit serpentine dialogue stretched corners cover maximum political ground , but chad allen nuanced sexily hard-boiled performance easily compensates these shortcomings . private eye donald strachey , allen comes off spenser crossed columbo dash brian kinney tossed into this enticing mix . though ron oliver direction isn't flashy , it very appropriate noir flick set albany . like richard stevenson books -- pages which donald strachey conceived -- this film character concept tension these two dramatic elements . stevenson one first writers infuse pragmatic , ultra-masculine private eye genre unabashedly gay aesthetic . perfect synthesis these two influences , third man out gives us detective who shares waltzes moonlight martinis his hubby , drives banged up toyota tercel lay bad guys flat unsparing right hook . third man production values outstanding cable film . keeping richard stevenson albany setting smart move here ! network , so many well intentioned films go astray when they aim glitzy settings end up cheap canadian photocopies . only flaws worth citing : couple actor sebastian spence scenes ( during which he portrays donald strachey husband cross c3po uncle arthur bewitched ) heavy-handed score ( good feature songs sandbagged some very obtrusive " tension suspense " instrumentals ) . what most delighted me third man thrill watching genuine polished noir flick which , every respect , thoroughly but naturally queer . while third man isn't brokeback mountain , it milestone its own right . it well executed , enjoyable film hard-boiled detective who wears bad ties breaks out blushing grin when his boyfriend kisses him cheek .	1
honestly , this just good movie enjoyed rainy day or girlfriend/boyfriend . it not supposed great genre-defining movie , it just supposed fun . three leading ladies play their parts exactly way they meant played . cici ( sofia vergara ) bombshell , lorena ( roselyn sanchez ) strong intelligent woman , patricia ( jaci velasquez ) plays rich girl . they great chemistry on-screen their rivalry played very well . it accomplishes exactly what it sets out : fun , i can't believe people trashing it	1
i happened upon this film late one night , bravo or fx , some channel like . i wasn't planning staying up or watching it , but i found myself constantly pulled back this film i no idea what title . i just felt myself sucked into it . so i gave up watched rest it . i never so spellbound , not happy pastoral way , but nonetheless hypnotized , film i this . actresses perfect their roles . you get defeinite sense altered realities , claustraphobially close minds two teenage girls bit ' off ' put it mildly . graphic , horrifying its realities ... just amazing . once film over , i caught end where it said it true story names , i immediatly go computer read everything this case . i horrified trip i just ... peter jackson brilliant . there no other way around it . friend mine sat me down watch dead alive show me work ' guy who doing lotr . ' all honesty i little frightened lotr . but then when i saw this , my fears instantly calmed i knew he'd perfect ... this fantastic film . masterpiece certainly ...	1

david mamet shows extent his talent writer director ' spartan , ' superior thriller all right moves . mamet completely avoids cliches predictability keeping plot constantly moving challenging . bring your thinking caps this one . this story that mostly plot little else , but there nothing wrong long you rapid pacing . yes , things get complicated get there fast . i don't want go too much into plot fear giving away plot twists . basically , val kilmer plays tough-as-nails secret service agent who gets involved case kidnapping president daughter . that all i say . really experience this film , it best go cold , while plot twists flood script , they always seem logical things unfold . it also worth noting this isn't generic action film . fact there not much " action , " normal sense word . but something always happening , once mamet charges this ticking clock pulse-pounder , there no turning back . mamet also doesn't waste time trite character arcs back stories . he soley focuses plot suspense thrills . characters seem almost if they already know themselves know their role events unfold . but mamet keeps them interesting tossing small details them throughout film . all all , this great thriller deserves more accolades than it got . it highly intelligent , never boring , always challenging , super-efficient , simply superb . see it . * note * : not see trailer before movie !!! it horrible trailer gives away many films secrets	1

what disaster ! this movie complete waste time start finish . animation ugly , horrible , unrealistic three stories bland boring . what disney thinking ? oh , i know ! " let see if we eek little more cash out cinderella . who cares if we destroy beloved classic ? " several main characters completely different original movie it makes no sense . first story , king turned happy-go-lucky doting grandpa-wannabe into stuffy , sour old curmudgeon . suddenly there rule no commoners palace ? uh ... isn't there line original " every eligible maiden kingdom ? " palace full commoners night . story picks up prince cinderella return their honeymoon , so space few weeks , king completely changed . i guess they weren't creative enough come up anything would stay true characters . other two stories equally nauseating not worth my time review or your time read . avoid this mess movie . really sad thing " ugly , horrible , unrealistic animation bland boring stories " pretty much describes any disney sequel or direc t-t o-video slop market	-1

this delightful comedy spoofing spaghetti western genre . it saucy sense humor . story pair brothers . one outlaw posing sherrif hide law . other ne'er well brother who fast gun faster his dry wit . each brother his own reasons decides help group mormon farmers protect them guy who wants their valley . old brother so because he wants steal rich man horses . younger just wants steal mormon daughters . nothing taken too seriously this film including fancy production values . it comes across inexpensively made italian wester because what it . not prevent it entertaining . unfortunately , low production values seem carried over into dvd transfer . i don't know this due poor quality original film or if it just bad job . whatever case , it still very watchable enjoyable . this one not particularly edifying but it fun	1

independent film channel showing few classic horror films here lately . week or two ago , it first third " texas chainsaw massacre " films , now this 1983 classic sam raimi . i hope second film way !. this my first real viewing film i remember . i saw it bits pieces some years back , dug it , but didn't remember much film whole . boy , i've missing out !. movie unabashedly filled splattering guts grue , any horror fan relish film over top gore . this same guy " spider-man " ?. always great bruce campbell heads up small cast ash(ashley ) , who goes little outing woods three other friends . only one gets out alive . they come creepy old cabin , things pretty much go downhill there . they find odd things including book made human skin recording previous tenant . before you know it , our little group resurrected ancient evil , they won't getting out alive . soon , demonic forces start take over gang , until ash put bloody gory stop it . raimi sets right tone delivers his chills thrills nice , organic fashion . looking back these older films , one appreciates them more when comparing them modern ones fancy effects cgi . raimi doesn't skimp awesomeness idea , let it all rip bloody good fun . only thing skimpy film characters . exception ash , three other friends mainly decoration taken down most awful ways . setting itself wonderful , brilliantly shot raimi . let face it , woods scary . woods night downright terrifying . raimi uses wonderful skill make most wooded areas making them not only sinister , but making them feel if they really alive . some make-up gore effects get chintzy here there , but most time they gorehounds delight . what you expect here ?. impalements , dismemberment , chainsaws , shovels , so . it remains seen if raimi ever return his low budget horror film ways . it would too bad if he didn't because he one masters	1

there lot traffic rome . especially " raccordo annulare " , where accidents also frequen t.t he traffic noisy dirty , especially when it rains . romans swear when they drive also when they don't . there many american tourists rome , especially around fountains piazzas , where they cluster sing american songs . italian men hit women tourists , who resist their advances . " se vedi gente che lavora , allora non e` roma " . romans not work . no , some them , , fact , morning till night . but rome not what it used . everybody knew each other polite , while now everybody rushed rude . besides , free love today substituted brothels yesterday . yes , some brothels chic , while others less so . rome bombed second world war . fact , bombing would sometimes interrupt theatrical performance . public then proceeded shelter , where flirting lovemaking would ensue . roman aristocracy close papal court . they run parties together , even fashion shows . cardinals complain outsiders try teach pope how rule church . , yes ! motoryclists go around colosseum , providing tasteless final sequence . one leaves cinema heavy sense wasted time . fellini really nothing all say eternal city ? after all his years there ? nothing except standard collection stereotypes italians , stereotypes occur every scurrilous joke , met pages every trashy guide ? it true there few nice sequences , especially often mentioned one destruction frescoes . then , great anna magnani appears 10 seconds tell fellini she won't talk him . perhaps also scene worth watching . but rest commercial cinema .

constant gardener interesting case strong direction performances managing paper over plot holes some serious lapses credibility . it hard imagine two central characters ever finding themselves together anywhere but writer wishful thinking , investigation into drugs ' companies faking trials africa relies perhaps too heavily slips tongue or odd incriminating document or conversation , yet edgy but genuinely energetic direction , better performances subject matter , it surprisingly powerful involving definitely one best john le carre adaptations . perfectly cast , ralph fiennes rachel weisz limitations work roles once : his awkward , half-apologetic shtick her over-zealous head girl act right here they irritating too many other films . not all casting or performances good , however , bill nighy showing again why he better light comedy than straight drama . danny huston shows some awkward beginnings before overcoming them fully inhabiting his pathetic role spineless lovestruck embassy official - accent seems little too affected first before wearing . well worth investigating	1

1993 movie version secret garden captures magic inspiring story both children adults , while bbc television version not . it plodding style , avalanche dialogue , low production standards let inherent magic escape . no matter how hard they try , multiple repetitions word " magic " not make tv show magical . some portions tv dialogue lost thick yorkshire accents unintelligible dialect , interesting only language scholars . other extreme too many wordy explanations what we just saw happen plainly heard spoken . just because television script corresponds closely beloved book not necessarily mean it makes good television , or it captures spirit book . children capable understanding something special or wonderful happening simply watching event take place . 1993 movie clearly knows this wisely lets picture speak thousand words . movie version communicates vibrant love life . you get know unique , even eccentric , characters though they real people struggling hardships fears . without contrived manipulations , you drawn into depths heights their emotions through use stunning visuals , dramatic portrayals , pithy dialogue , moments quiet contemplation , serene musical soundtrack worth owning its own merits . tv episodes , other hand , lot effort expended but no real drama achieved . example , during what could quiet , thoughtful moments solitude , mood often spoiled voice-over or use grainy film outdoor scenes - distracting contrast clear videotape used indoor sets . i've never made so aware production methods camera angles . i'd rather just sit back enjoy . bbc actors good appear capable much better performances , but director content their shallow characterizations few instances mumbling , garbling , stumbling over their lines . several points i expected hear director yell , " cut . try it again . " unfortunately , it not up normally high bbc standards . it nice better choice	-1
i saw this movie first time , i found out it very very violent . i laughed some good parts , but scene where amy hits wildlife keeper head frying pan trying cut baby geese wing not what you want your kids see . i think this movie should taken off market , but this type film no place lives young children .	-1

season 1 " millennium " featured fantastic performances its cast dark atmosphere made " x-files " look sunny comparison . unfortunately much year ended up little more than " murder mystery week " fare . thankfully second season , supervised former " x-files " producers glen morgan james wong , changed all . second season began suspenseful ' beginning end ' , where frank black pursues mysterious polaroid man who kidnapped his wife . this episode also introduces comic relief season two , computer hacker brian roedecker . even though ' beginnning end ' would fit perfectly season 1 , subsequent episodes follow different path greatly improved series . starting second episode , ' beware dog ' , continuing episodes such ' hand st. sebastian ' , ' owls ' , ' roosters ' , haunting two-part season finale ' fourth horseman/the time now ' , we find out millennium group existed since beginnings christianity isn't nearly altruistic frank black ( viewers ) originally suspected . addition millennium group storyline , we also learn more frank childhood via two holiday episodes : ' curse frank black ' , halloween-themed tale where frank encounters ghost neighbor who committed suicide , ' midnight century ' , emotional story frank trying mend relationship him his father . latter we find out frank not only one strange gift , his mother blessed/cursed ability see angels . lastly second season even showcased two comedy episodes : ' jose chung doomsday defense ' ' somehow satan got behind me ' . these hours television completely different average " millennium " episode ( say least ) but they're still worth look nonetheless . i could continue rambling greatness season two , but you'll really buy dvd set form your own opinions . dvd set come some bonus features , but only one worth season two documentary " turning tide " . rest bonus materials second-rate best	1

culkin(henry ) good job portraying scary lunatic , because he gives off spooky air . his acting , however very dull , takes away movie . however , culkins dry ( but convinving ) performance completely compensated performance elijah wood ( mark ) . not only mark most adorable , loveable child , but his performance jaw-dropping . spotlight this movie really belongs wood . he acts every scene out utmost emotion , passion . he makes this movie one best . it battle good ( mark ) evil ( henry ) . henry plays lunatic son , who awful things his family others . mark comes live henry his family while after his mom dies . henry mark cousin ( too bad mark ) . mark see evil lurking within henry , but he prove it his aunt uncle(henry parents ) before it too late ?	1
this movie complex journey into minds wachowski brothers how they got knowhow put trilogy depth into one single movie . they this movie so multilayered , half movie , talking through other characters since whole movie one idea , it turns out possibly most wholesome movie i've ever seen ! beginning end , its poses many questions lets you create answers within your own mind . everytime i watch this movie , i find something new natalie portman plays part perfect ... puts me tears . it takes couple time watching it it really kick . very well made flick . amaaaaaazing !!!	1
this movie , based thomas harris book , remake movie ' manhunter . ' story leads up events popular silence lambs film . red dragon remade because studio wanted cash surprising popularity hanibal lecter . unfortunately supply thomas harris books exhausted . so they revisited retitled this prequel silence lambs . thomas harris book original manhunter dr. lecter intriguing support character only . but now hollywood discovered hannibal character brings moviergoers so they take every opportunity red dragon add or lenghten scenes dr. lecter put him center stage . original manhunter fine film directed michael mann . it featured brian cox ( bourne identity ) dr. lecter william peterson ( csi ) special agent graham . this movie lacking all aspects original ( book ) . while anthony hopkins portrayal good mr. cox edward norton clearly out his depth . he unable convey complex emotional trauma agent graham experiences when he assimilates mindset sadistic killer who wipes out entire families . performances harvey keitel ralph fiennes also wasted here . my advice-buy or rent original .	-1

after watching 1 ultimate avengers i expecting action packed romp through park , but i realized this truly anti-climatic . hulk make 1st movie extremely appealing his rip-roaring rampage while decimating everything . i expected see even more hulk this time pretty much got nothing . yuk sidekicks ( no offense all other hero just sidekicks hulk ) blah , blah . while black panther cooler than i thought he would , this boring . where hulk ???? marvel , you please american icon like hulk some love give him some air time ? hulk must smash i cheered when he ( finally ) show up but sorry this movie mostly lame . well , i bought it i am stuck it . i am feinding hulk take it somebody ( villan or hero ) open up o whup- @zzz . please marvel enough aliens , there some really cook villians marvel universe ( really cool ) i fan avengers decades but much i like indepence day movie , this avengers seemed more like knock off . yourself favor wait until it comes cartoon network or something , this truly mediocre . hulk smash !!!!	-1

i am fan several atom egoyan films , curious milieu this one . since seeing it , i find my mind drifting back it some consistency ; empirically speaking , i know it affected me some levels i'm only dimly aware . i thought kevin bacon take character meant remind us older jerry lewis rich daring ; colin firth made indelible impression his straight man , repressed but debonair brit standing dean martin suave italian-american . alison lohman seems not quite up her key role , i found myself wondering if egoyan might someone more cerebral like sarah polley ( he cast her so perfectly sweet hereafter ) mind instead . classic whodunit dressed up artsy chronology , you find yourself changing your mind few times what really happened before final scenes	1
print looks like you're watching it through muddy water ; this something unclear " public domain " status this other capra works ? doesn't he family could help out his dvds way chaplin family , or even , use opposite extreme , family edgar ulmer , who released superlative versions some pretty dicey movies ? point if people paying something they deserve get it served up nice , all various dvds meet john doe painful watch . we've heard years re-worked ending film , one exists ( or existed one time ) . bring it ! now pleasure nearly entirely watching gary cooper react barbara stanwyck pure life . it sort like ball fire but bit more subtle . moviemakers knew they agood thing teaming two , because cooper slow-moving , nearly snakelike screen presence got injection caffeine when placed next stanwyck vibrant beauty her gorgeous clear gaze complexion . she doesn't even speak , she emanates something very basic her bones her posture . okay , movie writes itself into corner , what else going happen except if gary cooper not going kill himself movie break trust it established viewers . this always doe problem , it cheat come out ahead itself , it didn't work 1943 it still isn't working now . it great up until hour fifteen minutes ; then you feel gears start whine complain " hollywood " tries solve basically philosophical dilemma	1
i've never particular urge see breakfast tiffany . i'll watch any movie , but there few i don't want spend money such . i found this movie library figured " why not ? " here my review ; movie based novel truman capote ( subject last year " capote " this year " injustice " ) stars audrey hepburn one her most famous roles . anyone who didn't know this , hepburn doesn't play character named tiffany ... tiffany name jewelry store . anyway , hepburn plays holly golightly , eccentric playgirl who lives barren apartment nameless cat uses men way make money . she not golddigger , but whatever she ... it pretty close . holly needs money she middle looking wealthy man marry when less-than-wealthy paul varjak ( george peppard ) , writer , moves next door . two exchange romance candor holly begins calling him fred ( after her brother , who army ) . romance doesn't seem like it going anywhere ; after all , holly looking mr. " rich " right paul ( fred ) poor writer who also seems kind male prostitute one woman who lives 2e . course , this romantic-comedy so you know they're going hook up ... but what happens actually pretty entertaining funny . i suppose most humor comes fact film directed blake edwards ( pink panther fame ) ... majority comedic relief comes mr. yunioshi ( mickey rooney ) , " japanese " manager holly building who frequently remind her keep noise down . mr. yunioshi , course , tanned mickey rooney fake teeth yelling fake accent . he hilarious though , truly great character . character i liked cat , cat . sure it simple character , but i don't know man ... cat cool . hepburn peppard chemistry great , this movie made 1961 but picture perfec t.t his truly gem 60s . if you liked movies like when harry met sally , then you should definitely like this . wonderful movie . grade :	1

this movie one those family charmers something everyone . there exciting animated portion children . there love story ladies . there battle world war ii germans guys all ages . tying all these different aspects together wonderful concept ; angela lansbury mail-order witch ! during world war ii , parents sent their children london country because london bombed continuously . three children , carrie , paul charlie rawlins ( performed cindy o'callaghan , roy snart ian weighill , respectively ) , placed eglantine price ( lansbury ) . we quickly learn miss price completely uninterested caring any children they may upset her mysterious plans . children , we , soon learn miss price witch training , training received mail ! because miss price actually very nice , if somewhat eccentric , lady , she works compromise children , allowing them live her her large home . we also quickly learn mail order school closing , miss price looking important lesson . children miss price off find headmaster school , mr. emelius browne ( played david tomlinson , who also performed " tom jones , " " mary poppins , " " love bug " ) . their mode travel bed miss price modified using spell . mr. browne astounded his spells actually worked . however , mr. browne also sorry but he unable provide important spell miss price seeking ; spell could save england hitler ! soon children , miss price disbelieving mr. browne off portobello road find book containing spell , instead running into bookman ( played sam jaffe , who gunga din 1939 movie " gunga din , " other great movies such " ben-hur " " day earth stood still " ) . after escaping bookman , children adults head off mystical island encounter group animated talking critters . returning island , three children two adults prepared rest searching important spell when they discover german submarine landed soldiers planning create mischief english countryside . ending this movie charmer intrigue even most jaded movie fans , provide laughs everyone . this movie pure escapist fantasy begins very real life event , much like other similar stories such " alice wonderland . " i think angela lansbury makes this movie believable . she slips into her role very comfortably , making you believe she somewhat bumbling witch who barely controls her own spells . she admittedly novice witch , but very believable novice . this movie centers her her acting ability . once you accept miss price apprentice witch , traveling bed , which accompanied dated special effects ) , animated talking animals , armor moving itself easy accept . even easier accept laughs go story . this movie era when disney studios fool-proof formula delivering good family movies . this family movie one best , treasure every family movie library .	1
" goonies " my favorite movie all time . i bite my tongue whenever i watch it anybody because i literally quote movie verbatim . i've considered doing one person stage screen play , but i just can't seem get truffel shuffel move down . hehe ever since i saw this movie kid , it taken ahold my imagination never let go . i lost count how many times i've seen goonies now , but somehow , i never get tired watching film . it still amazes me how this ' 80s movie stood test time ; albeit imagination sheer genius richard donner steven spielberg . you know there 20th anniversary celebration gathering fans all over world back 2005 ? they all met astoria , oregon ; where goonies filmed back 1985 . jeff cohen ( chunk ) sean astin ( mikey/frodo ) even showed up event . correy feldman showed up few days after official event over well . it long rumored sequal goonies works , but unfortunatly , it seems warner brothers killed all hopes not relinquish rights donner speilberg ! talk huge mistake- jerk alert ; seems wb ridden up troy bucket . i could go this movie , but instead i elaborate goonies film subject .. pop soundtrack film score ..... " goonies " pop soundtrack capures fun-loving decade ' 80s listening these songs makes various scenes movie come mind vivid detail . my favorite track off cd probably reo speedwagon " wherever you're goin ' ( it alright ) " . i also quite like philip bailey " love alive " because song played during part movie where troy catapults brand off side cliff little girl , pink , training bike . classic ! who could forget cyndi lauper " goonies ' good enough " track ; not me . i love this song well , it brings back some incredible memories ' 80s this movie specifically . now .. address film score controversy .. there some debate whether or not entire film score ever released united states . many say it simply bootleg got around small circles . ( go soundtrack.com learn more film score . ) said , i know , however , film score recorded ' world premier recording ' cd , " best adventure " . i this cd , goonies score it , quite simply , amazing ! i'm not kidding , when i played it first time , i actually teared up . so nostalgic beautiful . recording this cd almost 19 minutes long ; it recorded city prague philharmonic . this only legitimate cd entire goonies film score ever released ; booklet this cd , " best adventure " also confirms recording ' world premier ' dave grusin goonies film score . there bootlegs circulated goonies film score it ebay . some these pirated cd so called ' previously unreleased ' tracks film . these ebay sellers blatantly lie trick try pass these cd off original ' imports ' japan etc . some people believe anything , so i am here set record straight tell you truth . i even found one ebay seller california gone far changing his user id three times try get away selling slick looking bootleg . this particular pirated cd 2 ' gold ' cd goonies dave grusin film score also so called gold coin prop replica two bumper sticker decals pirated music . i am keeping record what he up . avid official goonies collector , ebay seller also professional graphic designer , i hate see people getting ripped off greedy liars who know photoshop too well who visit knikos too often . i could go exactly how these bootlegs constructed believe me i could whip up exact repliac within day .. yup , even down printed gold discs , ' high quality ' decals , ' unreleased tracks ' , photo booklet gold coin replica . anyways , consider this information buyer beware , word wise , warning . all cd other than best adventure goonies film score pirated . so there no confusion , there legitimate japanese pop soundtrack import , which you see amazon picture above , but there no such thing japanese film score cd or any other film score cd other than " best adventure " . who knows if entire score ever officially released usa well , but , my opinion , found " best adventure " cd even better than finding one eyed willie rich stuff . while i think it , who knows whether warner brothers finally let richard donner steven spielberg make amazing sequal goonies . all stars up it well , but nooo , warner brothers go screw it up ! ( okay , enough stealing mouth lines ) . haha . i really feel , order get film score released officially usa , also order get sequal made ( before everybody starts looking like one eyed willie ) people . people like us who love this movie who dream big . like mikey said , it our time down here ; so start writing , warner brothers , people ; let your voices heard . it our time .. never say die .	1

i seen this movie many times think it very entertaining . brigitte bardot absolutly beautiful , she free sprited bohemian style makes her unlike anyone movies , yet she vulnerable innocent marilyn monroe .. i see how this movie caused uproar 1956 , but it nothing compared movies today . opening scene bb nude sun bathing wouldn't cause any commotion today , fact , some parts really funny watch . plot loosely based marilyn monroe life orphan who forced marry so she doesn't go back orphanage . problem she love two brothers , when she married one . there also older rich man offering her life him . it all leads wild erotic dance bb sexy opened skirt , bare feet , hair flying .. " this woman needs tamed " lol ! i think juliette just misunderstood , lost , lonely , girl , who only power seemed her beauty attention she got her many male admirers .. i would love see restored copy film , but i don't think it any " english dub " i don't like reading sub titles . i hope they release dvd dub option it . this one great classics era . it easy see how bb inspired hippy generation her bare feet untamed hair . beatles said she their favorite pin up girl ! this movie made her internation star .	1

this one those films makes me think it must impossible anyone make truly great film . back cover makes it sound like must-see anyone going through tough time their lives wanting shoulder lean , it seems all critics concur that not inacurate description , yet when i tried watching this film , i couldn't stand it ! whole thing jumbled mess . it kept going back forth things i just didn't care , tedious , boring things , i think it focused too much criminals involved story , making them sound sympathetic or whatever , when film cop who overcome grief ( supposedly , or something like ) death his partner who viciously killed criminal . story like this shouldn't spend petty time detailing exploits , trials tribulations whatnot why vicious killer kills people whatever else all whatever ... when writer wasn't focusing goodfornothing criminals , it focused bunch pathetic backstory , kind makes teenagers cringe thought reading book ( too much " character development " ) . then i saw truly breathtaking film , titled batman returns ( 1992 ) blown away its depiction heartbreak combined stunning visuals , everyone else like " oh , who cares ? " i truly hate this film i hate society lets people make such mediocre crap then acts like its their civil duty put up it ( watch it ) then say they liked it . no , not all my favorite films action/pop-corn flix . i also liked 1999 bringing out dead , well 1976 taxi driver , i even enjoy occasional " little movie " ( there too many mention , but i'll start last one i saw i enjoyed : wild dogs , director hanging garden - film i hated ) . ok , that all i say this film	-1

memories both good bad light up what yet remains day . this story how man finds comfort remembering what he achieved , what he lost . remains day saw reuniting merchant/ivory/jhabvala/hopkins/thompson team made howards end two years before ( 1991 ) . it almost pinter/irons/streep team made french lieutenant woman 1981 , mike nichols directing this time , but other commitments forced nichols just co-producing role . it would interesting compare pinter jhabvala treatments kazuo ishiguro book . this merchant/ivory their prime , it sumptuous production creates period milieu ( 30s 50s stately english country house ) without falter , proceeds suitably stately pace . there two parallel developments throughout film : first we see lord darlington ( james fox ) use his wealth position try soften resentment germany feels over harsh treaty versailles , only him disillusioned end . second concerns romance two servants house ( hopkins stevens butler thompson kenton housekeeper ) . darlington convinced more damage since war than during it , situation inevitably give rise war unless something ameliorate germany position . his standards old fashioned ones english aristocracy : fair play , don't hit man when he down , always act honour . however he fails understand something already ameliorate situation , it german , adolf hitler . he believes hitler . fair darlington , most europe before wwii believed hitler ( even his staunch opponent winston churchill once fan ) . one point darlington , who very kindly man , dismisses two jewish refugees whom he employed , simply because they jews . but it bothers him , point film onwards , he begins realise his mistake . during after war darlington hated nazi sympathiser collaborator , it breaks him . darlington gone through same experience prince salina leopard . what we seeing here values one generation replacing those . darlington tragedy he outlived his time . his values sneered , his position no longer unquestioned . he doesn't know what when dealing those who don't share his standards culture . sense , worthy he , he dinosaur . it smaller age , when working men decide policy they know nothing voting general election , where very people he trying aid treat him contempt dupe ( " we call them concentration camps , you call them prisons , but it much same " ) . butler stevens staunch defender english class values period . he built his life ideal service , more democratic age dawns , he difficulty adapting it . stevens knows order dignity must prevail , he what amounts small army under his command , each whom must know his duty his place whole machine function . stevens ' ally this formidable task miss kenton housekeeper . this alliance two capable people flows love story which second plot strand film . slowly stevens loses faith darlington , pivot his order . several times he denies knowing him . he sees great house its army servants dismantled . new , more egalitarian times bring new owner new master ( film american millionaire lewis ) . yet throughout stevens keeps his feelings himself . he no more expressive . it kenton who makes all moves their romance . stevens remains passive subject her decisions . now here difficult matter . throughout film we see stevens tormented again again his inability express his emotions ( superb job acting hopkins ) . we never know why . there no indication film stevens considers his ideal service more important , or substitute , his emotional life ( we told his father worked butler , yet he married ) . there moments when frustrations both stevens kenton treated humorously film makers . motivation given both stevens darlington indicates structural flaw film , its one weakness . we given no clue stevens ' silence his feelings . we expected feel it weakness darlington attempt appease hitler . but it historically unlikely him not so . time darlington meetings hitler elected chancellor germany , not fuhrer . he hadn't put anyone concentration camp . he published mein kampf which he expressed incoherent theories race not many could understand ( even , it said , hitler himself ) . he made demands take over part czechoslovakia which germany plausible right . he shaping up strong man europe ; many politicians relieved see him successful . it time when ' totalitarian ' no pejorative meaning . ( there only two ways avoid hitler regime : more lenient treaty versailles which would strengthened democratic government germany ; or declaration war against germany america 1932 ) . film features some best acting any film , not just principals but part virtually every cast member . merchant/ivory strong casting . they say they build their films around it . here it works . you won't see kind ' expert ' acting draws attention itself ; rather , you unhesitatingly believe every person who they claim . hopkins thompson wonderful expressing what each feeling behind conventional exchanges they manage . set , great house ( houses , film makers say ) perfectly convincing . period detail expertly . one finds out more how great house run those days than you could ever expect know ( one painting girl pearl earring ) . structurally , however , parallel set up ishiguro concerning darlington stevens their inability change times not maintained there mystery stevens ' reticence his feelings which stop his story tragic one it might .	1

this dvd reveals marketing campaign bush administration goal go war iraq . they no reason until 9/11 . but first they convince american people . other words , they lie . first lie : iraq weapons mass destruction ( wmd ) . very broad sense wmd mean chemical nuclear weapons . but chemical weapons tactical or battlefied weapons kill hundreds or even thousands . they also degrade rapidly usually within matter months . then , you see clip g.w. telling his audience saddam several hundred tons chemical agents . there clip condi rice saying aluminum tubes could only beused fuel rockets even though our energy department , un , ambassador wilson claimed they could not . next , there cheney claiming iraq reconstituted nuclear weapons . repeatedly we shown clip after clip bush , cheney , rumsfeld , rice powell claiming iraq wmd capability , claiming they couldn't wait smoking gun come form mushroom cloud . this nuclear side dvd which strategic application , kill millions . when asked if rumsfeld knew definitely where iraq keeping their wmd , he replied , " tikrit baghdad . somewhere north , south , east or west there . " really narrows it down . second lie : there connection al quada saddam hussein . this administration wanted us believe saddam would give traceable nuclear material bin laden so he could use it against us . we supposed believe ultra-control freak , madman virtual pagan would ally himself religious fanatic whom he might share power popularity . sure ! saddam support terrorism , which amounted giving $ 25,000 families suicide bombers israel . there no terrorist training camps under his control . period . third lie : attempting paint anyone who disagreed administration policy traitor . [ ... ] it clear this superb dvd this administration " data mining " i.e. defining their theory then looking any evidence suppport it , rather than other way around . analysts cia who wanted get ahead began write their intelligence estimates suit what they knew administration wanted . analysts who said there no connection ignored . vice president cheney made unprecedented 29 visits cia 9/11 start hostilities . he ever ask , " you certain iraq not involved ? " what would analyst conclude ? why rumsfeld suggest hitting iraq one day after 9/11 ? there no aluminum tubes , yellow cake , wmd , nuclear or chemical . we went war lie alienating our allies , giving our enemies reason . some important questions emerge this dvd : weapons inspector hans blix stated : " how could anyone [ bush administration ] 100% sure existence wmd zero percent knowledge where they ? " now neocons claim these missiles moved syria , but they don't know exactly where . now , how you know sure something one place if you don't know where place ? if israelis knew iraq all these wmd chemical nuclear weapons , wouldn't they bombed them ? would they waited us ? mossad , perhaps finest intelligence service world , spies all over place . they guided israeli bombs iraqi reactor 1981 . anyone believe israelis would sat their hands ? finally , why president bush take us war when he knew :o aluminum tubes not missiles or fuel ? o scud rockets didn't even range get europe ? o ambassador wilson told him iraq not getting enriched uranimum niger ? o letter niger claimed uranium deal made , actually fake ? o weapons inspectors stated iraq no such wmd capability ? o if this president took us war knowing their evidence lie or even suspect , isn't impeachable offense ? richard nixon charged impeachment violating his constitutional oath , failing ensure our laws faithfully executed , making false misleading statements , misuse cia , withholding information congress , deceiving people united states false misleading statements . sound familiar	1

ever since i saw " fahrenheit 9/11 " ( which i thought ferociously hilarious ) , i trying check out michael moore earlier work ( both books films ) . i finally got around see " big one " this weekend . i felt like i could really relate michael disdain corporate america spent time working major corporation myself . i could relate employees various corporations who continually gotten screwed over corporate machine . i think it hilarious how random house tried reign michael shenanigans during his book tour their escorts . while there lots hilarious moments when michael tries confront various company ceos why they laying off their employees when they making good amount cash , there also good mix drama . one my favorite moments film when michael went capital wisconsin talk then governor tommy thompson his welfare reform policies two women who living below poverty level . apparently new welfare reform policy tommy signed when he governor doesn't work everyone . i love politician michael women confront state capital equivalent snake oil salesman , no one buying his schpiel because those women went through process new welfare reform they still living below poverty . one most personal touching moments when michael book signing borders ' bookstore one people line woman who recently laid off ford co .. i moved michael concern woman . i also liked his conversations other people like diners iowa ( i think ) just getting their overall opinions presidential election ' 92 . like his other films , " big one " mixes biting satirical humor real-life drama . michael moore movies me like mtv show " punk'd " socio-political message without talent-challenged ashton kutcher	1

there scene reversal fortune where claus von bulow , surrounded gaggle well-scrubbed harvard law students assisting case , starts reciting few claus von bulow jokes cropped up during trial . " what you call fear dying overdose insulin --- claus - trophobia . " his delivery refined , slow , absolutely flat , no affect . look bemused horror faces students summarizes all contradictions this movie - they simply not understand man they're defending . jeremy irons won oscar this role - he deserved two . his narration acting brideshead revisited almost made casting him claus von bulow inevitability , he seems born this role . he appears so natural screen extraordinary because von bulow such odd , complex , thoroughly detached man . his veneer like lobster shell , exoskeleton ; he smokes cigarette same precision care surgeon would reserve slicing brain tissue . it clear even trial not reveal what makes this man tick , end it doesn't matter , he just so much fun watch . film narrated sunny genius , glen close too seems inherited this part rather than auditioned it . her looks delivery right point ; one wonders how different life coma life inside depression fueled booze pills . alan dershowitz , played admirably ron silver , provides junkyard dog energy fuels picture - everything him stark contrast refined mansions rhode island where even attempted murder must civilized , polite , according form . flawless production values put viewers inside rarified atmosphere , not just wealth , but wealth time age grow soft decadence . few things please us more than when things go horribly wrong super-rich . this film satisfies so many levels .	1

i've seen mike stern group live many times , after first few songs , somehow you get bit bored . this concert kinda same . it got great musicians it , though . great thing mike you tell he plays heart lot intensity . he actually gives 100% when he plays . i've never seen him keyboardist , which probably what lacks . dennis chambers great musician , however , his performance not really audience much it himself drummers . there very little his solos even behind songs average listener appreciate enjoy their level . if you drummer you appreciate what his doing very complex , but get boring average listener . bob franciscini great sound , but his solos get little abstract times but then he stops here comes mike again . richard bona phenominal bass , although he doesn't overplay like other members group it fact makes him shine . he great job tipatina . overall it good performance . i preferred see dave weckl than chambers , myself , but now i just view dvd whenever i wish see mike that good thing	1
this excellent film . billy bob clean-vut barber who keeps himself . his wife married him because she liked he didn't talk very much . it tragedy epic proportions , great performances all involved . only thing me holds this back five star film fact every single scene someone lights up cigarette or taking deep drags one . alone justifies this film " " rating . when watching this film , it seems they encouraging people " cool " smoking pleasurable thing . most notorious moment me when frances mcdormand sitting bathtub asks her barber husband ( billy bob ) shave her legs . he walks somberly cigarette drooping his lips she tells him give her drag . this putrid moment just drove me crazy ! but then , just my opinion . overall , film could good greater if it not incessant smoking throughout . plot slow yet intensely emotional . if you don't mind smoking , then you probably enjoy this dramatic tragedy . if you strongly opposed smoking or children who interested seeing this , you should review film before letting them see it	1
i already fan welles " touch evil " when i came across this gem 3 am one night public tv . variety reasons , i keep volume off , but nonetheless i spellbound couldn't wait hear dialogue plot ! set little expensive casual viewer , but film so entertaining if you catch it sale or used i heartily recommend shelling out it . it fast moving , quirky little film noir some amusing dialogue ( my favorites include " criminals aren't worst people - they're just stupidest ! " " they're penitentes - it means they're sorry their sins " - " they must awful sorry ... " ) . whatever reasons history personality there , welles films simply over-critiqued . this enjoyable any 40 bogart caper flick accident history left it sadly ignored - so " thank you ! " criterion finally giving this marvelous film it day sun . i pleased opportunity see other ' versions ' film , but snappiest version still " confidential report " - warts , continuity gaffs all . it somehow comes across very humorous - something i felt new edit lacking . that odd because footage mainly same . perhaps it pace dolivet version maintains . one thing criterions bw transfers i bone pic though , shadows simply too dark . my home vision vhs copy seems easier eye little details within shadows apparent , where criterion transfer they solid black . i same trouble watching " seven samurai " i'll keeping my vhs , too . ah , well . overall i'm thrilled hope they release " trial " someday .	1
great plot ! crooked president who only thinks himself his needs ; good hearted man named dave who thinks others , only thing they common their outward appearance . dave called upon sit president his job while . two presidents regular staff try get dave things contrary dave character . so story goes there . who win battle crooked verses good white house . this dvd picture good clear , sound great , case excellent condition . if you like warm hearted type movies , then this one you . i know i enjoyed it over over . me , dave character , good or bad , choices we make life affect others around us .	1
this quite simply best book film adaption ever accomplished hollywood . ever . i am author myself , part what inspired me narnia . my heart always tied this land created cs lewis . it pure magic , this man phenomenal writer his story original fantasy . first , let me tell you my usual reviews book movie translations . i absolutely detested lord rings trilogy . i know it sounds harsh , but i hated those movies . peter jackson , though great director his own right , absolutely butchered tolkiens world . me , those movies if he took book , rammed it into shotgun , fired , picked up scattered remains , glued mismatched pieces together handed it actors . thats how bad i think they . if books never , those movies would great stand alone movies , but they aren't , because they removed many better sections tolkiens tale . harry potter . i loved first few books , i got really pissed off movie when it came out because once again , they cut out many better scenes book . i stopped watching movies after second one . so , you probably expect , when i walked into movie theater december , waiting see chronicles narnia : lion , witch , wardrobe , i very antsy , very skeptical . narinia closer me my heart than any other novels hollywood ruined , so i expecting worst , same time , dreadfully depressed what " worst " could mean . i walked , i took my seat , film started . beggining " blitz " scene began , i immediatly noticed how close reality planes bombing manuevers . ( historian heart , thats brownie point right there ) then i realised importance this first scene . director putting viewer into middle lewis time . showing you what surroundings he writing this . right then , i started hope . movie unfolded , children got train , first opening strain true " narnia " music began play , i began cry . no joke . i sat cried first few minutes i heard music . because i knew right then there , narnia stepped out cs lewis mind , out his book , onto this screen . this director managed bind very essence narnia into this movie . there differences . it true , changes made . but they small , they few , they far . whatever it director this movie , it bound spirit book into this film . i cannot tell you how happy i when i left movie theater . there no words describe it , coming writer , who describes things living , thats pretty damn hard come . this film magical . everything , all casting , all sets , all lines , if they personally overseen c.s. lewis himself . when you watch this film , you there . you stepped through walked into narnia . so , if there any doubt your mind buying or watching this movie i hope i cleared it up , because i tell you if you shell out whatever cash buy this , you very , very glad you . best thing movie like this , gather your family close you , sit catch lights off , christmas eve , watch this . welcome narnia folks , i never thought we'd make it , but guess what ? aslan worked miracle just you me	1
i not enjoy this movie very much . after reading what this movie , i really high hopes it . i expected it very interesting moving . but after watching it , i somewhat disappointed . one flaws this movie it focuses too heavily friendship main character little girl ( main child character ) . she becomes obsessed him develops crush him . she gets jealous possessive when he tries help or others , whether they children or adults . i certainly not like part where man innocent child take her place transport death camp . addition , i strongly suspect her voice dubbed woman voice . it not sound like little girl voice all . this movie flaws play end movie , where main character children try show red cross what really happening jews europe , , my opinion , not very well . children pushed into space supposed represent gas chamber , then they quickly pulled out . main character , knowing he children going killed anyway , should concluded play children lie down pretend quot ; sleep . quot ; this would sent less ambiguous message red cross . overall , despite these weaknesses ( several others ) , i found movie passable , am not discouraging anyone watching it . however , i certainly not add it my collection holocaust movies . some holocaust movies i feel much better , would strongly recommend , include schindler list , sophie choice , europa , europa , escape sobibor , good evening mr. wallenberg , life beautiful , triumph spirit ( latter two movies among best movies i ever seen )	-1
only problem this dvd there isn't enough info original investigation . this truly fascinating watch , very sad commentary state mind middle america even nowadays . these children screwed over so obviously our " justice " system sad really burns heart anyone who believes justice . most fascinating character still crazy step-father who totally " sketchy " really appears much more capable murder than docile children who convicted . i haven't seen first film would love know more just how these kids railroaded . they alibi , what argued motive etc ., etc . these details would nice addition this film just so everyone more familiar background , however , this still very interesting flick . very sad	1

i heard this movie years ago thought premise sounded funny , but never made any effort see it . i happened notice it video store other day when i saw sean hayes it , my memory it came back i thought , " okay , sure , sean , it least entertaining . " i really wasn't prepared how deeply funny , sad , brilliant this little film . let get past problems first : bad lighting , amateurish camera angles , okay , yes . but story wayward reject april ( katie holmes , who so brilliant perfect i can't understand what happened her career -- oh right ; tom ; oops ! ) her desperate attempt prepare thanksgiving dinner her estranged family , most hellish apartment building nyc , superb . some lines come out nowhere just force you laugh , they so funny true . patricia clarkson mother cancer oliver platt her loving , keep-positive-at-all-times husband , just simply outstanding . movie keeps moving all times its funny-tragic plot , its sad little subplot boyfriend bobby ( derek luke ) trying find nice suit impress april family , just takes hold you drags you this dysfunctional family world insists you go ride , whether you like it or not . sean hayes not big part i thought he , but indicated without shadow doubt his off-kilter comic timing cinched him part jack " grace . " only thing questionable why world would he living this delapidated hell-hole his purebreed dog his spanking new oven ? other residents , including nutcase vegan , staggeringly funny lillias white woman who first lets april into her apartment use her oven ( few hours ) , entire chinese family who patiently listen april valiant attempt explain history united states -- all it just outstanding . i loved it , loved it , loved it . ( i say i loved it ? )yes , you get over atrocious lighting ( hello people -- ever hear lights ? ) , if you claustrophobia you might freak out feeling tight , crammed little apartments , but if you get past those things you enjoy ou t-t here humor tinge tragedy , you're treat . thumbs up all way	1

frank mccourt best-selling book so good , this movie so true it , if you liked one , you'll like this because rarely film so close book . it amazing , given what normally case . even though film brought no surprises , i still thought it fascinating because fantastic cinematography here great job actors . muted colors this film beautiful lighting superb . then again , it hard go wrong nighttime streetlight-lit shot cobblestone streets . directing talents alan parker never more evident than here . he should more movies . book , " angela ashes , " biography mccourt his extremely poor irish family . all three boys who play mccourt various times his development excellent here . whole cast excellent , matter , led " angela " ( emily watson ) husband malachy ( robert caryle ) . two sadder-looking faces , you never see , more rainy , dreary town ( limerick ) you never see .... so if you're looking happy , uplifting story , pass this one . however , if you want film totally true great book , wonderfully photographed film one acted well .... some unique humor it , check this out . i don't want leave out humor , key ingredient mccourt otherwise- depressing days growing up . humor dire poverty never went together so well mccourt made it sound through his book filmmakers through this movie .	1
three problems this film : 1 . pacing - film pacing doesn't vary . it very boring . matter fact , this wouldn't problem if film much more tense ( e.g. , " speed " ) , however this film lacks high-action intensity pull off such slow expository speed . 2 . effects - too many sequences this film rely color light superimpositions , there overabundance high-speed imaging . scene changes employ erratic barrages images desensitize viewer thrilling " horror " scenes . furthermore , they fail make enough sequential sense film plot really mean much film greater whole . upshot : film relies too heavily art editing , point where plot twists no longer interesting . 3 . triviality - plot conclusion quails face " so what ? " question . viewer left sense , " i sat through film ? " light points ( 1 ) ( 2 ) , this obnoxious bit icing cake . don't waste your life . alon	-1
violent anyone ! this movie horrible . cast good , but plot stinks ! its just this family who super powers . then this kid wanted mr. incredibles side kick . ( way) mr. incredible says no so then he hates him . then kid turns evil kills people , wants every body like him . thats origanal . there barely any jokes you laugh once every 20 minutes , there way much violence . killing , guns , punching , bombs , they say stupid words sometimes . i not like person who directed this film because he should not like violence . so i not recommend this movie anyone . especially 2 disc special edition !	-1

i'm dance teacher , so occasionally i buy dvd get new ideas inspiration . this one total waste time . when i fast-forwarded through scenes dancers showing off there only 20 minutes actual instruction . it not hiphop ! dancers training , moves like pivot turns kick-ball-changes ( standard jazz dance fare ) , disguised called something else . there no pop or lock moves , dance ' routines ' monotonous . good real hiphop dancing dvd scenes ' instruction ' where dancers showcased their talents - but they never break these down or give any explanations them . dancers good , instruction isn't . it completing misleading call it hiphop . it jazz twist funky style .	-1

this dvd really good selection gang/ rascals comedies , among best bunch ! " free wheeling " ( 1932 ) much said supposed racism gang/rascals , but this possibly most anti-racist all gang films . dickie moore snooty mother overprotects her impaired son refuses let him play stymie , who she referrs " colored boy " " street urchin , " but guess who saves day ? strong stuff 1932 good stuff today . mike fright ( 1934 ) hoot gang " international silver string submarine band " running amuck radio station . love gag where tommy bond sucks lemon ( " they're good your freckles " ) while leonard tries play trumpet .

i really looking forward movie . my goal expand my understanding this historical period . many scenes looked like they used old sets 50 westerns lighting technique disappointing , these alone not turn me off watching . my real gripe movie dialogue acting . within first 10 minutes movie , stage coach robbed , my attention drawn portrayals actors . they not believable dialogue just sounded like something came out book young readers . later , when alerted posse nearly upon them , other rider responds such uncharacterist language male ruffian i laughed . movie plodded forward , scene after scene left me wondering , how quickly this thrown together how come they didn't rehearse more . i felt my patience endure several more hours unfair punishment . i generally try watch movie entirely but frankly , i think it embarrassment waste time . maybe it got better ( why i gave it two stars ) but i find doubtful . i am wondering if both tom berrenger other author missed many classes script writing 101 .	-1
this truly one finest films ever made exposing tyranny cuban communist state over one its weakest subjects . irony film , effeminate homosexual poet , actually bravest , strongest most heroic man film . only " real man " reinaldo arenas . while latin ' macho ' heterosexual males actually cowardly accomplices no honor , guts or bravery . reinaldo patriot , real man who not lack courage his conviction . this film make you rethink concept manhood , our homosexual hero stood firm against castro dictatorship , continued his conviction world literature which dominated pro castro left ... thus guaranteeing his works would never published . unashamed his sexuality , he faced death same conviction he faced injustice while living castro communist cuba . see this film . one caveat , i suggest you buy dvd see film english subtitles . poetry dialogue make experience something you'll never forget . imagery film , outstanding , musical score perfect . scene johnny depp both transvestite gestapo like communist interrogator my opinion one his finest performances . especially memorable , lezama lima explaining our hero since tyrant cannot govern beauty , he wants destroy it , allowing 400 years cuban culture go down drain while everyone applauds . there so many universal truths this film one simple review cannot possibly elaborate 1/10 them . however i guarantee you never forget this film . just remember use english subtitles it stay you rest your life	1

i all prepared rate " hard boiled " slightly above average hong kong shoot-em-up entertaining but nothing would distinguish it similar fare . then director john woo serves up inspired finale hospital rank one most ingenious action segments screen history . set-up some gangsters stashed arsenal hospital morgue . police uncovered operation which leads stand-off them hoods . caught hospital staff , patients , some oh-so-cute newborn babies . less said better . nevertheless , woo throws out rulebook what action film . woo essentially toying us first hour or so order throw us this delicious curveball . i imagine some people revulsed this segment . personally , i awestruck grateful artist like woo taking risk	1
i forever dark why anyone would dislike this piece theater . so many times you hear how " cerebral " " inaccesible " sondheim shows . it so hard people think feel same time ? beauty this piece it forces audience think their relationship art ( either artist or patron ) same time allows you care characters deeply . alright , so you listen it few times before you really begin " get it . " this work allows you witness artist ( considered genius many ) who devotes himself competely his work only realize he must it expense all his other relationships . " beautiful , " during which george tries but realizes it too late connect his aging mother , " we not belong together , " when love his life tells him she simply cannot #2 anymore , i am not sure how anyone watch these amazing moments not moved . score haunting acting ( except few moments don't quite work mr. patinkin ) astonishing . it very risky choice opening number during which soloist hardly moves , but bernadette peters draws you start ... brilliant acting . perhaps voices not " perfect " dvd they original soundtrack , but give me actors who willing sacrifice perfect vocal delivery emotional content any day . this production one my favorites essential anyone interested artistic process	1

okay , let get one thing straight , acting pretty good . all kids cute adorable pretty darn good job their parts . vin diesel good lovely watch , lauren graham movie ! ( think : lorelai gilmore ) . though , lauren looked different some reason , i couldn't quite place it ; added pounds ? new hair style ? i don't know ... anyway onto storyline , or lack there . put it simply , it appears object write movie vin diesel it , style kindergarten cop . however , someone failed hire good writer , or director ! they rushed through intro cut through blah-blah ( substance ) story just so they could arrive part where they could " showcase " vin diesel this role tough guy caring some adorable kids . it not convincing ; so many scenes just happen they leave you feeling like you whiplash . all all , it probably great movie kids 8 , 9 , 10 years old .	-1

" dream , silly dreamer " tells story walt disney company dismantling its historic animation department , very foundation which company built . it still seems incomprehensible . world loves classic disney animation . this great american art form speaks child within each us . behind each classic disney film artists who created them . this their poignant story . everyone who loves animated films must see this film , which documents destruction disney animation studio its legacy which spans seven decades . i'll admit it - i am far casual viewer . i am passionate student classic disney style animation . i am awe technique required real , full-blown animation . but much i respect technique , i am moved investment artists ' hearts medium . it power drawings come life , animation ability move us , i find so compelling . preface , let me tell you " dream , silly dreamer . " it wonderful film . everything i hoped it would ... even more . it contains wellspring sentiment . it captures passion animation artists their art form its heritage , their sense community . film strikes remarkably delicate balance . we witness shock , disbelief , numbness artists leaving disney . yet , film doesn't wallow sadness , self-pity or anger . focus film genuine respect artists classic style disney studio animation , their elation part it ... their simple joy moving pencil over piece paper - ultimately creating magic . opening title card ( visual parody old buena vista logo ) , there clever graphic references disney . opening page-flipping animator sketchbook recalls many animated feature opening ; this time around it tells fairy tale without " happily ever after " ending . particularly striking animation dark storm cloud overtaking animation building , marked scream !

this product limited no longer made universal studios . steven spielberg prefers you buy his new " enhanced " version e.t.i , like most reviewers here , prefer original version this movie . what spielberg 2002 this movie he computer-animated e.t. , enhanced few scenery shots , added two extra scenes , digitally removed all hand guns . now i don't mind him adding extra scenes , but all other things basically changed film . i liked e.t. puppet . he more real . speilberg basically just threw away all work puppeteers ( which made up little people , boy no legs , lady doing . . ' arms ) . yes spielberg , i understand this what you would if given technology back 1982 , but you don't change anything . digitally removing handguns replacing them walkie-talkies stupid too . government agents use guns stop anyone who tries stop them . spielberg philosophy behind doing this he regretted government agents using guns apprehend kids . but that what agents . how they going stop kids walkie-talkies , say , " hey , i walkie-talkie i'm not afraid use it . " spielberg also upset guns family film . well , he didn't really make this " family film " when he allowed cussing it , such " " word , " " word , somebody calling someone else " pen*s breath . " how come you didn't edit spielberg . so if you , try buy this product , because this only way find this film its original version ( unfortunately this product 2002 version but it all worth it ) . every director should freedom what they want films , but keep original versions fans please ! goes you too george lucas .	1
it amazing how hollywood publishing industry bent their knees secession mythology , birth nation present example melodramatic falsification . this very dull , shapeless , stilted movie . i wouldn't bother denounce it artistic grounds , but since it above all piece propaganda , i'm compelled condemn it history . what it presents " war states " version civil war , which gallant southerners defend their homes , their beloved hills dales , their cultured lives inexplicable invasion rude hordes north . there only two black characters , both sentimentally loyal their southernness their masters ; otherwise , slavery beside point . generalship lee jackson , course , idolized , while northern officers above rank colonel portrayed fools . battle scenes perfectly predictable ; guys charge foot , other guys shoot , fields littered bodies . wouldn't little exposition logistics those battle more interesting ? how real it show only one train , southern , war won more transportation than musketry ? if you believer myth lost cause justice secession , if you ever cottoned notion war wasn't really slavery , then i challenge you honor ! i defy you read just one heavy , scholarly book , arguing slavery william lee miller , professor university virginia . it retells debates occurred house representatives , over slavery , 1830s , twenty-five years before election lincoln . uncompromising sectional hatred expressed those debates surely convince you civil war deeper roots than you thought , slavery indeed central issue both sides , blue grey	-1

dead end classic , but one that pretty much forgotten these days rarely revived tv , let reissue circuit . it shame , because alongside crusading social drama it also one most strikingly designed magnificently shot films thirties thanks greg toland remarkable photography richard day marvellous set . almost every shot film extraordinarily imaginative - not just beautifully composed , but also absolutely right scene . william wyler hands , it still works pretty well drama despite plethora stereotypes . joel mcrea , most unjustly forgotten star 30s , makes best worst them idealistic but starving would-be architect , dead end kids when they still kids hadn't changed their screen names half dozen times display early signs all irritating shtick would turn them into one most painful ensembles 40s , but sylvia sidney striking worker , claire trevor hooker ( no typecasting there ) bogart disillusioned gangster make most their opportunities . but marjorie main bogie mom ? that hard sell best days ! bogart dead end kids would cross street warners lot co-star angels dirty faces couple years later , but this one beats even cagney classic . sadly no extras , but dvd transfer quite superb . highly recommended .	1

would " caligula " or " nero " shocked what their city , eternal city , become so many years into distant future ? or would they ( probably more likely ) find themselves fitting right somehow ? this one notions i found myself pondering i watched this movie . it really great movie , it certainly worth any true film fan time . i may even liked ( some it least ) better than ( again , some ) la dolce vita . grown up italian family - my father born " pagliarone " ( roughly , slang dialect term meaning " stone hut " ) ancient very rural village molise - i myself definitely right home , so speak , watching scenes like famous " dinner piazza " . ( personally i could watch scene again again not get tired it , but ... maybe it " italian thing " , so speak , others would not find it so amusing ) . however there certainly no dearth general humour found antics wild cast characters which fellini always brings into his films . roma course no exception this . example bedridden obese old woman hairnet , who owns building he stays rome when he first arrives rome , who tells him , " now let just live peace not bust each other balls " ! or bald old man who rather convincing mussolini impersonation . my personal favorite though would probably ultra-tanned " continental " type guy who approaches female american tourist second she gets off bus , telling her , " you very bella " offering take her picture her . or young man piazza scene ( which supposed taken place some thirty years prior ) who wearing gold medallion one those black nylon " do-rags " ( kind rap stars wear today ) , yelling up his dark beautiful brooding girlfriend get down piazza before he throws her off balcony . sure these walking stereotypes , these characters , negative ones . but , they say , there kernel truth ( least ) all stereotypes there not ? instance entire " dinner piazza " scene , any italian or italian-american must admit , definitely resemble some sort " prototypical " pre-emigration summer-night-in-bensonhurst or some place like , plenty gold chains , " dago-t " , " pane vino " go around . more serious note however most touching scene ( this point usually generally agreed upon i think most movie fans ) scene sudden ( apparently accidental ) destruction ancient roman frescoes modern work-crew . obviously this fellini artistic condemnation , if you , massive industrialization city modern times , ( clearly potentially disastrous ) effects what we may call " godless modern " encountering ancient sacred . cruel loud machinery encountering long-buried , " resting-in-peace " , " sacred " . such imagery , like fellini vision vanishing ancient frescoes , so evocative it truly make viewer want weep . athough rome improved much since fellini filmed it back 1972 , this film , during both time periods he shows it us , city appears delusional . vaguely delirious fever perhaps . or throes long restless night full tossings-and-turnings wild " half-waking " dreams . it these dreams fact constitute " images " " vignettes " fellini shows us throughout film .	1
[ ... ] this film deeply moving my perspective because it so well produced . subtleties nuances what truly distinguished film . thus , instance , very low current homosexuality which undergirds two main characters always present , always acting , but doing so behind scenes , way keeps viewer unsure exactly where deeper feelings stand two men . nuance love-hate relationship our two protagonists share one . they example classic case " can't live him--can't live without him " . [ ... ] essence , what i found so truly impressive film its realness , realness disguised under character persona . joe ratso not truly cared any other male until they met one rely one . ending film quite tender , depicting how caring gentle loving joe nurturing ratso during his debilitating illness their bus trip florida . film indicates transformation , expansion , growth both characters , they come realize their lives much more than parochial narrow self interests . this film won several academy awards ( 1969 ) , my opinion , deserves its classic moniker . both hoffman voight turned excellent dynamic exceptionally convincing performances , i would say this film showed them their best acting potential . i added this one my small collection expect enjoy it years .	1
last reviewer said it all . this great concert , great deep purple era . but they ruined this disc . transfer horribly poor , looks like it bad videotape transferred pal ntsc , not professionally , so it jumpy quality . i very excited get this new disc i one brazilian boots it years . while this disc some interesting extras , dual layered dvd-9 , missing song , it all wasted horrible video transfer job they . it looks like vcd it so bad . band should embarrassed unauthorized overseas versions this show look much better than this . i'll probably never watch this disc again brazilian version i bought ebay years ago looks much better . there got much better master this show than this . let hope they pull this coaster remaster it right way . i just don't understand it . my advice go ebay get one those overseas boots this disc because they much better quality than this piece junk	-1

first time i saw casablanca , i didn't understand why everyone loved it . i tend look relationship aspect films , my eyes , romance rick ( humphrey bogart ) ilsa ( ingrid bergman ) lacking . set , no one knew whether ilsa supposed truly love rick or not which caused bergman play part ambiguously . however , i finally realized relationship strong because rick love ilsa . it didn't depend mutual affection all . this revelation , i able see film what it : masterpiece . rick own rick cafe , seedy bar casablanca during wwii . casablanca still free nazi control , though nazi leaders swarm streets . this makes it place filled refugees hoping escape america . these refugees leader against nazi , victor laszlo ( paul henreid ) . he brings his wife rick , beautiful ilsa . it throws rick into tailspin ; two lot history he brooding over her since she left him . there , he begins act rather uncharacteristically . no one deny cleverness script ; afi recognized many lines it 100 years 100 quotes ... list . also recognized afi list theme song " time goes .

`brian song ' , true story brian piccolo his fight against cancer , one most critically acclaimed `made tv ' movies ever released . this due mostly heroic story acting chops mr. james caan . film , chronicling relationship two football players chicago bears , one white one black , showcases these two men they bond over course time . brian ( caan ) helps his teammate gale sayers ( billy dee williams ) when he injured during game need physical therapy heal his knee . likewise , when brian diagnosed malignant cancer gale there his bedside giving him emotional support , helping him put up his fight against his latest opponent . brian fight lost , but his story lives . film based novel `i am third ' taken fact brian always second ( or even third ) choice team , always one best , but never `the ' best due players like sayers . acting this film bit lacking , although caan giving yet terrific performance , shelly fabares fine job julie , brian loving wife , but williams performance shy reserved sayers bit forced , his breakdown locker upon hearing brian condition completely unbelievable . caan acting legend , releasing this just before his brilliant turn `the godfather ' sure get him noticed . this film remade before , story not changed , but it caan brian i'll always remember .	1

400 blows francois truffaut first feature film , 47 years later , it remains ( my opinion ) his best most famous film . it not hard understand why . movie not perfect , it doesn't visualistic stylishness jules jim . but every line , every shot , every moment movie seems come straight truffaut heart . film semi-autobiographical -- like antoine , truffaut lonely juvenile delinquent . truffaut would make series films chronicling anti-hero antoine donel ( jean-pierre laud ) , but none those films matches overwhelming impact 400 blows . story simple enough -- antoine , dreamy , sad boy , neglected his self-centered parents , gets trouble school , engages some petty theft ( typewriter , specific ) . his parents think him burdensome trouble , so he sent away juvenile deliquent school . not much storyline , it ? well , that genius 400 blows . i've yet see film recreates teenager life such keen eye sensitivity . truffaut uses deceptively simple devices " follow " antoine his sad journey . one such example antoine interview psychologist deliquent school . it filmed one long take , camera focuses squarely antoine . psychiatrist/counselor never seen , so antoine speaks straight camera , i felt like he speaking straight me . antoine answers questions mix insight , sensitivity , naivete , incoherence . antoine talks everything his sexual impulses his relationship his parents . one point , he says , " oh , i lie now then , i suppose . sometimes i'd tell them truth they still wouldn't believe me , so i prefer lie . " example day outing students antoine school . truffaut uses overhead shot follow students they skip prance their way around streets paris . beginning , children all one line . but slowly , kids begin diverge different directions . it could hokey , but scene unforgettably charming . , course , final " frozen shot " become one most famous film history . again , simple device , produces huge emotional impac t.t ruffaut responsible much film success , but huge part film performance jean-pierre laud . his dark , sad eyes , he reminded me little sal mineo rebel without cause . many children tend " overact " attempt appear serious , but laud performance so understated pitch perfect end movie i thought antoine friend , someone i wanted protect . antoine mother ( claude maurier ) also perfect . she not horrible , abusive mother , but her self-absorbed insensitivity becomes painful watch . i love way she rushes around crowded paris apartment , if she didn't patience sit down even second . when she coldly disowns antoine during visit juvenile deliquent school , it absolutely chilling . criterion collection dvd commentary track robert lechaney , who portrayed antoine friend rene film . there also interviews truffaut laud . highly recommended .	1

movie head takes look trappings closeted gay son ari ( alex dimitriades ) traditional greek orthodox upbringing . director ana kokkinos tries flush surface isolation alienation one man feels his family alternate lifestyle they would never apporve . within this script , ari enters into realms drugs unprotected sex then comes realization this how his life must end up . alex dimitriades his credit helps this movie tremendously , his dark good looks , brooding nature , tortured portrayal man torn secret life . however , this actor cannot carry movie alone other characters movie not come through vividly . director wants make point how various ethnic beliefs impacts hardships some who want come out but afriad too , yet avoiding confration must take place parent offspring viewer injustice because full message not delievered . director should concentrate more family life interactions giving greater sense anguish , instead ridiculous clubs parties . movie continues its downward spiral , it comes abrupt end no real realistic resolution comes head , thus viewer left seeing gay movie where it easier let audience draw conclusions than movie itself diving deeper than surface drugs , sex denial	-1

we purchased this visual gospel well over 10 years ago when there wasn't dvd available price $80-$100 . we've given copies this video many people gifts simply because we think it best depiction real , human jesus he would . bruce marchiano portrays character beautifully range emotions he shows he pulls viewer amazing . whenever i watch his portrayal jesus garden gethsemane rest events after , it drives home point this jesus who laughed totally human also felt all pain despair he endured . he it willingly ? i think there times doubt despair but character shows believable glimpses doubt supported incredible faith . i'm shocked some bad reviews listed . fact , i wish i could give this video 10 stars . without doubt this most inspiring video i ever seen my life . i hope pray it never goes out print i wish more people would open up their minds jesus who real , who smiles , who gets hungry dirty , person who feelings just like us . after all he fully god fully man . jesus this video not smokin ' anything one poor reviewer indicated . quite contrary . it sad know people close minded judgmental cannot open their minds viewing such believable human portrayal miracle man who walked earth . i'm completely amazed feel unbelievably blessed we watch video this interesting , mesmerizing , engrossing " word word " bible . i think directors producers this video inspired vision create artistic piece masterful showing time period , how word written passed down generation generation , gives viewer much more accurate realistic time-frame how jesus taught disciples everything he . this best money you'll ever spend .	1

i must begin saying i am not fan shirley maclaine early work . her speaking voice shrill , i think raves mainly her body . so it worth noting i love " what way go . " when actress big name longevity , there one movie you point say , " watch this movie , you know why she star . " i feel this movie movie miss maclaine . she sings , she dances - move move gene kelly - she carries this movie entirely her frequently bare back . she throws herself 100% into every ridiculous costume change situation , always self possessed , but not self concious . here , her body certainly made use , take-off french art films equally silly , sexy , laughable ... but her over top performance humor lifts it all above air-headed plot . film itself gets kudos me because , like miss maclaine , it knows exactly what it , comfortable , laugh itself . when she says , " it like one those big budget movies , all love what she wear next " we know there no pretentions here . what this movie . it quinessential movie celebrating girl . it also happens pinpoint rare moment movie history tough women , when boys took over . it deserves it very special pink dvd box . it unique . silly , slapstick , sometimes trying way too hard , but great kick off your shoes , pile up popcorn treat	1

' war peace ' book i my teen years loved read , sensing it gave picture life something ' large ' ' deep ' beyond anything i known my own experience . movie so oddly constructed , course so poor language feeling if not spoken same breath book , nonetheless its virtues . its picture opening ball , its world bright color costume enabled me ' image ' my own mind its world i not able reading book . one things which most struck me watching film my sense comparison images screen , images my mind characters i somehow ' thought them ' reading book . henry fonda certainly not ' pierre ' . he too thin not overall bearish strength , tolstoyan power book makes pierre . other hand , audrey hephburn natasha film replaced any picture i might my mind , became ' natasha ' . so this least film gave me . film too long , confuses times . but it i said , picturesque , colorful quality which makes it more enjoyable spectacle than anything else	1

i should bought this dvd before i . i never allow 3.5 star rating distract me again , particularly when some attacks against this dvd infused immature invective against finn personality . pacing , perhaps most important aspect any yoga set , nearly perfect , allowing one truly work body pose while meditating . it almost seems like i am swimming through this session . even though he places set backbends after his salutations before his triangle sequence , somehow everything works . also , this gem some most important poses yoga , whether one classic hatha or power yoga . two single leg standing poses ( warrior iii king dancer ) probably two most important balancing poses yoga . i enjoy how he ends his triangle warrior sequence each one repectively . eion seated pose sequence borrowed straight astanga minor modifications also quite impressive . furthermore , his dvd something every other power yoga set lacks -- complex inverted finishing pose sequence . when complete yoga set performed , it leads rejuvenation no other workout match . i only long version because i am doing this sequence strength yogic complexity completeness . anyone who takes yoga seriously truly wants increase body/mind connection needs this beautifully complete yogic experience	1

it ironic ( or perhaps not ) woody allen mia farrow midst terrible breakup when this film came out . i only saw it recently , it one those films technically would never fly , unless allen behind it . i enjoyed partial-documentary sequences where characters discuss their marriages , breakups , etc ., dark comedy surrounds it all . sydney pollack judy davis old married couple you think would stay together forever , but they're breaking up . woody finds himself strangely drawn one his writing students ( juliette lewis makes film ! ) , who seems get every man she meets string without even trying , mia hooks up liam neeson ... there certain shallowness protrayed when it comes people , really hit me . perhaps i going through my own marriage breakup time i saw this awhile back , it struck chords me i didn't think it would . any case , this not madcap woody film . it sometimes harsh examination how people deal each other , don't always realize what they've got . you need right mood this one , but it worth time	1

this difficult movie me review , because my attachment original book . adam wacky , fun-filled sci-fi romp novel so rich ideas movie can't really more than touch few more important themes . movie tries hard here but i say some best ideas left out , no doubt due time money contraints . but some adams best ideas characters made it into film , few notable omissions , which i mention below . even conceding those few omissions , movie visually appealling breathtaking special effects . however , i few problems flick , although i enjoyed it thought it good flick overall . main problem i movie i think casting could better . still , it good although not stellar . example , sometimes actors seemed less than absorbed involved movie , except brief scenes here there , i thought most convincing players stolid unprepossessing vogons who beaurocratic bad guys film , although john malkovich character good . but then one expects mr. malkovich perform his role his usual ability panache , even if film itself less than stellar . also alan rickman good voice depressed robot . also , i said , some best ideas left out , such restaurant end universe party there , bumbling but sensitive cops . i'm sure many adams fans wonder why those very funny entertaining scenes omitted , but no doubt practical considerations made their omission necessary . i still enjoyed movie despite these flaws , dazzling special effects probably worth paying freight see movie just themselves . but i suspect die-hard adams fans miss original inspiration adams goofy , fun-filled sense wonder made actual books such phenomenon . still , all all fun movie worth seeing despite few shortcomings	1

while i occasionally grew frustrated this film , i soon realized what director roeg trying . this should left up individual viewer figure out . what should particularly noted here not only gorgeous location photography , gorgeous indoor photography roeg use color , but also wonderful performance theresa russell milena wanton heroine . she simply beautiful . story two polar opposites ( art garfunkel russell ) meeting colliding psycho-sexual relationship told fragmented , flashback fashion get confusing . but if you stick it , it powerful charge . it no way pleasant or amusing . culmination their unhappy relationship disturbing even appalling . there other films similar themes ( " betty blue " " turkish delight " come mind ) but they were'nt quite this dark . recommended adults only	1
if seasons 1 2 this fantasticly written , orginal series good , season three ... well , think good word even better plug it . orginal first two seasons gags based mostly dialouge . while they still hysterical , season three bost more action-based even funnier gags , such killer-kebab . plus dialouge still up its old standards , anything but shoddy . only dissapointing thing this season actor who plays holly leaves ( i belive he quit because they weren't paying him much others)and replaced actress who played " hilly " plaralell universe . i'm sorry , but she just doesn't same comedic air " original holly " . other than , show only gets better . trend continues season four	1

shutter would probably rate one better asian ghost flicks come out over last couple years . i stated review movie red shoes this style movie getting too clich�d . after taking break few months i recently started watching asian ghost movies again . only major downfall shutter several movies came out after it released states first so takes away some impact . i seen shutter during its initial release i'm sure i would liked it more . now that not say i didn't enjoy shutter because i very much . but like i said several movies came out after shutter just happened released here first . despite clich�s shutter , proves asian filmmakers still capable making movie like this make it enjoyable . unlike some other ghost movies it takes while before haunting begins . normally few things start happen it foreshadowing things come . but shutter it starts happen rather early stays through movie , which what helped keep movie moving . let honest here though long haired asian girl doesn't exactly strike fear it once viewer . we seen it so many times now it lost its impact bit . but directors banjong pisanthanakun parkpoom wongpoom still able make best scenes they able make several scenes lot creepier than they really should . while i can't say i scared , but there several very suspenseful tense moments , which majority lacking recent movies like this . all asian ghost flicks i seen recent none badly made they just suffered too many clich�s , but this movie able make best them . mystery angle rather solid , but same time i felt more time needed would made movie even stronger . while script wasn't bad , shutter sometimes bit slow when there no ghostly haunting . characters ok ; while they weren't boring they weren't strong enough carry movie when there no ghost . but said there very interesting twist character tun . he not innocent most characters these movies excellent change pace . like i said there flaws ; again we seen this style movie played out , while characters good they just weren't interesting enough carry movie too long . besides clich�d only problem i shutter some scenes just fall bit flat . me it just seemed characters often repeating themselves scenes just different words . that not say shutter wasn't well-written ; it solid script most part . but there also several things shutter excellent . scene when ghost side car creepy scene provided great jolt when ghost chases tun around late movie one creepiest scenes i seen asian ghost flick quite sometime . those new this style movie i would say shutter should one first films you see so it doesn't lose impact scenes . those who well schooled these movies , shutter won't offer you anything you haven't seen before . but said it far one better asian ghost movies despite clich� it probably keep you entertained . i stated earlier review several movies made after shutter just happened released here states first , which shame because it hurt movie little bit . closing despite clich�s some flaws , shutter excellent movie shows there still some life left this sub-genre .	1
i bought this dvd because i ~ apparently unlike many other buyers ~ thought first season best ; especially first half first season . back when it addressed what it like move across country , or just out your own , after college professional , social , financial issues we faced doing so . after season one , melrose place went touching meaningful yet nighttime soap ( albeit fun one ) . if you want suds catfights , stick later seasons . if you want wonderful friendships some drama ~ reminder those wonderful terrifying times ~ definitely buy this dvd set	1

it great see something totally different come out asia . while their ghost stories aren't only ones produced they most popular over there states . it sort like american slasher movies if you look around 80s dominated them , but isn't all made american horror . after my last viewing ghost movie , which south korean movie red shoes i decided take break . while not bad it just suffered same basic formula past movies . bloody reunion there no asian ghost girl found , which nice change . i wanted see this movie quite some time , but what i got wasn't what i really wanted . i'll skip plot rehash since there already description here amazon . lot people compared this friday 13th due whole deformed kid . besides bloody reunion very little common friday 13th flicks . first half bloody reunion quite slow we meet characters , but around midway mark things start come out we learn past grudges . while , bloody reunion interesting set up my problem there no sense dread doom lingering . i never got feeling something bad gonna happen . john carpenter halloween it michael myers always lurking back round . dario argento it deep red despite killer only appearing when they killed . director lim dae-woong doesn't bad job , but he just doesn't create any mood first half . he try , but it just wasn't working . 2nd half when things pick up killer starts knocking off all characters one one . but problem killer shows up attacks . it not always kill scenes its more how it built up lot times . best parts movies like halloween , deep red original black christmas set ups not actual kill scenes . bloody reunion some graphic murders , which fine , but again there wasn't much set up . characters ok maybe if i cared more them approach would worked better . none characters really stood out honestly they all alike . i'll give credit makers going character development . we learn little them , maybe more so then your average run mill slasher flick , but when all said none stand out enough . asian horror isn't really known their gore these days , but i noticed they getting little bit more violent . bloody reunion some violent murder scenes while they cool looking i just wasn't all interested . one thing bothers me horror movies these days twist endings . it seems like every horror flick take some kind twist end . some work some don't some just seem they sake it . first twist bloody reunion might little confusing , but it all pretty much explained . but my problem twist without giving anything away it sort renders everything came before it rather pointless . i've seen other movies twist like this , but i don't know they seemed work where here it just didn't . i really wanted like movie while i didn't hate it i just walked away thinking how it really could so much more than it . it nice change pace though asian horror . ghost story really seems run its course . i like slasher movies , but not much i when i child . those into slashers asian horror you might like bloody reunion . again i didn't hate it , but i feel it could better . my opinion it more 2 half star movie , but since isn't option i decided go 2-star rating . bloody reunion doesn't come highly recommended , but it not bad boring night nothing .	-1

" those who tardy not get fruit cup ! " trying explain why you like one mel brooks film no particular feeling like trying explain why one guy slipping banana peel funny guy doing same medical emergency . all i know i think line , especially stated nurse diesel , uproarious high anxiety one my favorite mel brooks films . some say it take-off hitchcock , or even satire . far it , my view . i think it affectionate , good-natured hug brooks director he respects . so , one level , we sit back enjoy hitchcockian references , some which very clever . level , we still enjoy famous brooksian low comedy sends one gag after almost fast we blink . when two come together ... when birds splatter fleeing dr. thorndyke , instance ... it match made heaven . besides , anyone who turn man strangled telephone booth into coy phone sex scene my vote . sure , movie erratic , but that brooks . what makes so many gags work , i think , brooks , dignified , mystified dr. thorndyke , observer . brooks this movie reacts things far more often than he instigates . if you enjoy hitchcock films flash -- vertigo , north northwest , psycho , spellbound , under capricorn , notorious , birds such -- there built-in level affectionate amusement . high anxiety , all it imperfections , funny . this no criticism many brooks ' other films , but i also think high anxiety lot charm , more than any his except young frankenstein producers ( first version ) . brooks outstanding job playing thorndyke , new head psychoneurotic institute very , very nervous . he may center story , but it quiet center ; he surrounds himself memorable grotesques he not afraid let steal their own scenes . among others , there harvey korman ( " less bondage , more discipline !

i'd say i disappointed when i first saw first episodes unlimited . it named final fantasy , but very little linked it incredible video game series same name . story seemed immature generic not interwoven many character driven side stories ; only final fantasy mascots appeared ( chocobo , one ); music didn't reflect classical style went games . so , needless say , i didn't bother buying anymore dvds series . then box set came out , i admitted myself i least curious how this series would end , plus i learned gonzo made unlimited , gonzo yet fail me any my anime endeavors . i bought it , i watched first episodes again . i cringed , because suddenly i felt same way even found few more things i disliked it . but i didn't stop , continued watch , found , slowly , this series evolved . it became emotionally driven , lot elements made final fantasy great . there mascots galore ( stated chocobo , cactuar , moogles , summons , cid ) . some music heard heard previous games ( opening song -- not title song -- battle victory ) . still , it wasn't final fantasy its namesake , but i found watching anime entire way through okay . though it isn't good chapter final fantasy , it great stand-alone anime nonetheless . it great animation , strange style seems both classical cutting edge ( astroboy cg ) . story deepens two main characters search their parents , other story lines reveal themselves well , such kaze story , main character charge powerful gun capable summoning creatures into battle , lisa , martial artist power control elements . antagonists also turn into something more than they beginning . deeper , more sinister foe appears later , one adds sense dread story wasn't there previously . all all , it adds up one decent anime . value itself can't beaten . twenty-five episodes anime less than fifty-bucks . it difficult , however , recommend this anime . i'd only recommend this final fantasy fans who don't take game too serious . if you , you'll disappointed this anime . i'd also recommend it anyone who enjoys experimentation their animation . if you enjoyed kid story animatrix , you'll enjoy this	1

this set starts when richard bucket retires his work . just think , all day home his wife , hyacinth . if you've watched series , you imagine horror . this set , we see more haycinth sisters , father neighbors . they get more screen time this set than first four dvds . we also finally see hayacinth sister , violet , her husband , bruce . still no sign their son , sheraton , though . patricia routledge excellent job playing part stuck-up , snobby , british housewife high social ambitions . she plays character so well , she really makes you hate character hyacinth bucket make you feel great compassion everybody encounter her . psychological torture inflicted hyacinth her neighbors acquaintances becomes more developed more apparent set . one cannot help but feel great sympathy everyone she talks ( good laugh same time ) . extras so-so . they include some outtakes , interview patricia routledge clive swift british tv show , cast biographies , " memoirs hyancinth bucket " ( one hour flashback episode ) , some other stuff . if you plan buy series , i recommend you " keeping up appearances - full bouquet set " ( 8 dvds ) amazon.com, it much cheaper than buying this set first set individually . side note , there one episode where i think writers took hyacinth out character . she party which she invited some new neighbors , but she also invited her " socially unacceptable " family ( daisey , onslow , rose ) this party . normally , she would never this side her family mingle her parties .	1

reason your getting this obviously youve seen this show sci-fi found it entertaining ... now only difference i found this broadcast version sound par fuzzy ... sometimes you need turn tremble/bass down bit make sound little easier understand when fellas talking loudly ... but most part its not too terrible ... visually its pretty good but little pixelated during night/dark room scenes , but you take into consideration these sets giving you 4 dvds $20 dollars ... if you wanted remastered video/audio edition , youd probably paying price other seasons tv shows mid $50 dollar range ... so i just try not complantive things enjoy show its substance ... its worth price very entertaining ... so i highly suggest picking up copy so when season 3 finished we fans get next season dvd ... hope i helped you decide this ... ro	1
i first saw this video when my nephew ( now 17 ) little . i always remembered it when my son born i looked it everywhere dvd . i took it home happily surprised it good i'd remembered . my son loves every song we sing several them random times during day . although adults know it 80 ( thanks cameos met jets players well other stars era ) songs not dated one iota . fact , it more fun my husband i watch because we've made game out naming stars . i definitely recommend this dvd	1
i ordered this 2 dvd set , including both original " fly " " return fly " starring vincent price , " grand seigneur " ( master ) fantasy sci-fi genre . i am glad i . i could ordered remake its counterpart " fly ii " , but i preferred start beginning i righ t.t he classics may less sophisticated sfxs ( special effects ) , but acting far superior . ambience two , typically fifties , adds charm whole . music tense , but not overbearing eighties movies screaming girl there , where one wants her , right time too ... who forget finale original " fly " , almost work slapstick comedy , but so dramatically funny . second follow-up , " return fly " not so brilliant , lacking glamour color ( although cinemascope ) , its story comes goes , but still valid sequel those very campy " drive-in " movies . whilst first , vincent price just shoulder al hedison , second he truly becomes star action . everyone who loves particular feeling fifties widescreen movies , won't disappointed . both not considered horror movies , or just science fiction ones , although elements both genres present , no , more likely , i would call them twist " film noir " genre . fact , especially first one , entire plot told while police investigation conducted , clarify vicious murder case . second , we more crime movie , which mobster blackmailing hero , obvious tragic consequences . while watching these two installments , one keep mind fifties , science fiction horror movies considered minor secondary genre . taste time western spectaculars crime movies , such said , so-called " film noir " . combining both fantasy/sci-fi genre truly daring move , well touch pure genius . doing so , allowed producers take some liberties its contents , emphasizing some elements exagerating others , build necessary tension style reaching well constructed climax end . both movies more than worth money spent , even newcomers fifties movies . while ' 80s version its own appeal , more modern adding some truly scary effects story , it not make it more interesting or more appealing viewers . i like jeff goldblum actor , but i cannot see him stealing seat vincent price . granted , he not play his role . while fifties you happy canadian family , its head , hard-working scientist , we ' 80s , receive eccentric scientist who slowly goes mad moreover solitary guy lose tie female journalis t.t his " fly " part one . part two , we also differences . said , " return fly " ( 1959 ) more crime movie legendary rescue hero its final revenge scene . " fly ii " , 1988 , fumbled attempt create sequel . jeff goldblum geena davis gone altogether . they don't even get chance cameo roles . we totally unknown actors something meant new story altogether . " return fly " we vincent price reprising his original role stealing show . nevertheless , now both versions out , when doubt , buy them both . also 1980s " fly " series available compact collection also affordable price . my suggestion you , viewers , buy them both then compare them yourselves . but warned . if you faint heart , ' 80s collection rather gory could cause you some visual shocks , while ' 50s versions more stylized lot left your imaginations work out . it up you	1

how delightful learn this movie issued again dvd . i little more than echo praise other reviewers . it worth its weight gold . i first saw it soon after it came out , when i young teenager . i so impressed , many months afterwards , i wanted nothing more than become coronet player . i eventually settled piano lessons , somewhat later , guitar . there no question my mind " five pennies " seminal influence my decision learn music . result , playing music one those activities i still enjoy i meander through my sixties . this movie resides my deepest memories such classics " westside story " " breakfast tiffany . " its best virtue , my opinion , musical content . i still listen danny kaye rendition " five pennies , " there nothing compare kaye satchmo ( louis armstrong ) duet version " when saints come marching . " it goes without saying technology movie production come long way since 1959 . but technology alone not ensure excellence . it difficult imagine cinematography this movie could significantly improved modern techniques . i readily admit nostalgia colored my attitude toward this movie . but , what wrong ? i treasure those few things 40-50 years ago still vibrant my deepest memories . " five pennies " definitely one them . you won't disappointed this movie ; it one select few timeless . enjoy	1
this first box set released season one pokemon . this collector set indeed only 4kids american dub no second japanese version . it contains three discs ; each nice hard case slide into one cardboard sleeve . artwork box each individual case nicely . set contains first 26 episodes season one . note though , this not entire first season american version contains 78 episodes ( 80 japan ) . this means , according my calculations , two more box sets would need released ( each containing 26 more episodes ) complete season . also , aware episode , " beauty beach , " not its rightful slot not part this set . even though it first banned during season one , it later played " lost episode pokemon " during orange islands season ( though heavily edited ) . it not clear why episode not reinserted back into this season , would make logical sense . menus decent but nothing spectacular . when it comes scenes selection , each episode divided into only two parts . first , before commercial break , second , coming after break . video quality looks pretty good . after comparing color episode one this set version originally released dvd just three episodes , i found colors slightly brighter or vivid this version than other . overall , this best edition season one there date . it worth purchase if you not mind american version . hopefully , they release rest season one very shortly . i rate this product 4 out 5 stars because it not contain episode " beauty beach .	1

even it original 3 hour running time , film still felt bit too hefty . like lot cases extended editions ( opposed director cut ) , extended version simply alternate take ; kind optional version film should you feel compelled see it . i always liked dances wolves , directorial debut kevin costner multiple academy award winner , but i always felt like sum its parts won me over but maybe not unified whole . lt . john dunbar united states officer during civil war after unsuccessful suicide attempt him running bare into enemy fire but miraculously surviving , he option posted anywhere . he picks fort sedgewick , distant remote outpost where he'll live himself . hanging around camp wolf he names two-socks nearby sioux village over time , he becomes friends even becomes part their community . relationship one women develops but he still deal approaching officers who want conquer more land , effectively driving out sioux . extra scenes meant develop story offer more background taken their own , they actually work pretty fine . instead finding dunbar new post deserted , we actually see officers previously stationed just left . we get more screentime some minor characters which help flesh them out but takes away dunbar himself losing focus him . all scenes gives off feeling making movie more longer than it should ( costner says himself commentary when he says " it not secret i like long movies " ) but luckily there disc change so you don't watch all 4 hours one setting . far film concerned , it quite great film some gorgeous cinematography , excellent performances some pretty exciting action scenes . costner might not most immense range but there quite few films where he convincing this one them . i 2 complaints whole : narration read like kid who asked read book passages class kind uninvolving drone . when officers show up they almost this kind malevolent quality where they're portrayed hick morons guns . other than though i don't any issues film while it probably something i won't turn constantly , whenever i watch it i still like it . one concern i wish addressed where special features . it reminds me lord rings extended cuts where all main in-depth featurettes longer , expensive cut so while i no issues stuff we get here , 2 commentaries feature-length documentary broken halves , it would've worked bit if option all it theatrical edition would help people who want bonus parts but not it attached longer version film . it probably isn't going everyone cup tea there even times where i'm not big fan but there other times where i get quite involved it so give it shot see what you think . word caution : theatrical edition normally available full screen so it either 4 hour widescreen or 3 hour full . i can't stand full so buying this one inevitable	1

first off , i want preface this saying this movie not everyone . there those who like things spelled out them movie those who like challenge , this movie challenge watch , but well worth it . there not lot dialogue this movie i read somewhere director because he wanted capture scenes before after characters would spoken . heat moment , so speak . so what we see characters their most raw vulnerable , entirely naked some cases . without dialogue rely , actors forced use their facial expressions express their emotions which they superbly . i say i found everything this movie refreshing . i like cinematography use vibrant colors certains scenes well muted tones others . everyone movie just plain beautiful look first i felt movie seemed bit long , but then when it kept going there came point where i didn't want it end because i become so invested main characters who not seem superficial all . they very believable we all similar situations our youth . it seems there always something better other side , but there really ? i think fact storyline not totally linear might bother some , but i found it made story more interesting it seemed provide alternative versions or character perceptions what going . i so excited this movie i order director first film " thousand clouds peace " which filmed similar way ( little dialogue , much longing stares , etc ... ) but i found it not quite good . perhaps my expectations set so high this film . still , i think this director watch . next tsai ming liang , i think he my second favorite director now	1

if you interested knowing what challenges monarches other powerful people face , this movie great beginning . you may or may not interested russian history or even world history , but this particular story greatly encapsulates emotional , physical political issues faced two powerfully-born adults their children . other reviews this site terrific their critical perceptions this movie its strengths weaknesses , so i not go into too much detail " sell " anybody action or dialogue , or historical accuracy . suffice say this movie -- its unedited version ( crucial dvd ) fact tell it like it ( or ) . nicholas alexandra two human beings who happened born into western dynastic system still prevalent turn 20th century . they responsible , almost biblical sense , destiny humanity , only they opted out , then executed . this would considered " romantic " if humanity not such overwhelming need leadership designated heroes . dvd version critical see full relationship alexandria rasputin surrendering power , also see rasputin his full decadent expression ( which must positively repulsive russian history revisionists . ) it also necessary , emotional historic context , see " failure " nicholas -- he could no longer carry responsibility godhead . it also relevant see execution rasputin hands two hop-head fairies who also line inherit this godhead , they themselves dreams american incorporation . alexia ( nicholas alexandra only son , who also happened hemophiliac ) hates his persecutors very personal , adult hatred -- those who persecuted romanov dynasty people who hated themselves took hatred out leaders they loved despised . they loved their leaders , despised their need leaders . if you purchase this movie , whatever your reason or interest , please buy dvd so it unedited ( meaning uncensored ) so thatyou may judge yourself	1

due circumstances beyond my control , i watch this . , surprisingly , i enjoyed it am dive into written word . this milestone someone who embraced literature much his life , but avoided anything pre-1800s , especially shakespeare . anyway , aside , some impressions film : 1 . liked black white , set design , costumes , overall artistic design . 2 . thought there some really great artistic scenes , especially ophelia floating water . 3 . olivier hamlet : okay , but he seemed lack particular vitality perhaps better-suited younger less-mannered actor .	1

this third cheech chong film , coming after up smoke ( 1978 ) cheech chong next movie ( 1980 ) . films series traditional way -- characters continue , there something linear development per films ' chronologies characters , but plot this film isolation , threads holding it all together pretty thin . nice dreams , cheech chong selling dope barely disguised ice cream truck . they may struck it rich this point , or maybe cheech just doesn't know how read numbers very well . any rate , they not seem hurting money -- they bag it , after all , which they pursue later film -- somehow , they're living very expensive , big house beach outside los angeles , although it seems maybe they're just crashing friend friend place while he away ( he musician tour ) . lot it pretty unclear , because last thing cheech chong writers director ( only chong latter case ) concerned telling anything like traditional story . instead , it seems like maybe they high while they wrote filmed this . that usually meant negative -- idea denote how little sense work makes , or how little coherence it . i don't mean it way here . i don't mean it knock , necessarily . i mean it literally , consequently underscore kind stream-of-consciousness , absurdist surreal flow . those all very positive qualities , they occasionally here . but maybe cheech chong just looking easiest way string together number sketch ideas , not enough sketch ideas , because some them drawn out or reprised past their freshness date . probably goes whole premise cheech man ( chong ) selling dope getting into wacky situations while pursued sgt . stedanko ( stacy keach ) . nice dreams feels too much like cheech chong just coasting -- vamping while waiting next soloist start . although i love experimentation much anyone else , this film would benefited stronger focus telling story traditional way . i don't always think something different better just because it different . so this definitely step down first two films , although there more than enough funny moments keep fan first two films mildly entertained , most supporting actors , including returning ones , enjoyable even more potential . some skits ( word fits here better than " scenes " ) , like crazy house fiasco donna apartment , even " save whales " song , good most material first two films . but overall , it just seems like their hearts , maybe their heads , weren't much into making film time around	-1
unique screen chemistry john wayne katharine hepburn barely elevates western rehash " african queen .

this not your average crime story . clint eastwood plays man we first encounter preacher rural church . shortly into sermon , gunman comes starts shooting preacher . he takes off running eventually gets picked up young man played jeff bridges . two hit it off become buddies , even though eastwood character significantly older than bridges ' . over time , it learned eastwood bank robber . after big heist , money disappeared people who trying kill him think he stole it ( other crooks ) . eventually , they hit upon scheme rob same bank same manner before . idea nobody would expect them try things same way again . there trouble other robbers . one stupid other just plain mean . after successful heist , this leads problems which film must resolve . although action line movie story bank robbery , it really friendship two main characters . it touching watch sad unexpected end . it rather dated film but it still worth watching .	1
course this not best movie world , or even best french movie . but it entirely life-enhancing , shows truffaut humanity humane feeling . it certainly film watch if you're feeling low want cheered up . it so clever way truffaut deals himself : actor playing part director film , ferrand , director , , course , director actual film . he gets wonderful performances jean-pierre leaud ( his other self , here several previous films including les quatre cents coups ) , nathalie baye , most especially english actress jacqueline bissett ( whom he supposed affair during making film . truffaut one great letter-writers , up byron , joyce virginia woolf ( google book ) , both his letters this film show virtues catholic atheism : he not shred religious belief , but he extraordinarily kind understanding man who yet entirely obsessive film . watch this if you down , pick yourself up trufo after : master-work	1
worth seeing , no doubt . however , makes you wonder what true genius like akira kurosawa would such original premise . this director here misses masterpiece film his hands something like hair . three main characters better developed audiance would more reason togive damn what happens them . alas , it didn't happen , although script pretty damn decent works most part . i said following so often past : give audiance something/someone care -- because if they don't kow much people your film they not moved what happens them . just way it . said all , i still maintain it worth seeing . branko djuric very good here . check it out . i wish i could given it five stars	1

this one my favorite movies . it immaculate : it not single wasted second -- it tight spellbinding . filmmakers juxtaposed tale horrific spree killing young very likeable sociopath/psychopath/psychokiller , played brilliantly martin sheen . when we first meet him , he young , southern good ol ' boy ton grace equal measure charm , tough , seemingly extremely self-assured , macho , self-reliant . he just this odd little quirk blowing people away if they irritate him too much or if they get his way , then stepping over their bodies , proceeding next moment . he obviously ill educated , ignorant , yet some point we see he made decision carry himself great pride , self-assurance , masculinity , whatever his circumstances . my favorite exposition his personality when he finally arrested ; he chats policeman though they just bunch good ol ' boys sitting around bar he buying drinks ; just cool cucumber , friendly , totally disingenuous . kind " what you see what you get , " now let get it . not hair out place , not tremor or tic indicate rage , malice , or , dare i say it , evil . juxtaposed him sissy spacek character , who sweet , young , totally sheltered , dumb , naive , but who also seems no trouble stepping over bodies putting her energy into staying alive doing what she get through moment . juxtaposed wonderful music -- something like calliope music , sweet dreamy . juxtaposed wonderful cinematography -- shots midwestern prairie , often flat , sometimes golden , never bleak . it totally mesmerizing satisfying . i hope i'm not only one who could not horrified all terrible bloodshed murder--i'm passing buck this marvelous film , which gave us story mass murder balletic fanciful context	1

first time i saw it , i thought it too silly ever watch again . but friend made me watch it again , it grows you . shootouts especially brutal . not gory , just brutal how they all last 10 seconds , then there bunch people dead ground . dvd technology hugely helps this one , too : i got it down 25 minutes skipping opening titles , spy scene , outhouse , street shootout , ten even , last stand . 25 minutes . don't waste time extraneous things like character development or love interests . tag line " regulators ! let rack out !

okay , maybe last one isn't really european , but you get point . i watched this over weekend , rental everyone favorite blockbuster video ! i loved this movie ! it took us where roadtrip wishes it could taken us ! i really liked " scenery " way . i didn't rent this movie longest time , cover showed some goofball white dude pointing his fingers funny way this goofy smile ( he almost looked mentally handicapped ) it just looked so " dumb . " honestly . but cover unrated version , shows young female actress removing her bikini top , it looks damn hot ! also , unrated version ton more sexy scenes , including lots nudity . i also believe this first dvd i've rented gave index nude scenes , well index additional " unrated " scenes . now that' hot ! movie very funny , put together well . i felt like they actually europe , when you watch some special features , you learn they actually . i felt like hit every country they said they , but something tells me it only 1 or 2 , they used stage sets . but , scenes all realistic looking . i especially noticed this vatican . damn funny ! some other reviewers comparing this other american clowning movies , but i didn't see it way . i saw it us making fun their stereotypes . i mean how could you sex comedy europe , not berlin or netherlands comedy scene . scene where italian businessman keeps molesting tourists ? i roommate said italian man kept chasing her molesting her city bus , so yes , stereotypes based some aspects reality . get over your pc correctness ? okay ? it funny , because its partially true ! i stop short giving this five stars , but i give it this rating :d vd movie alone : 4 starsdvd movie special features : 5 starsmc white said : check it out !!	1

usual gene hackman perfectly cast this dark portrayal us international forces monitoring bosnian/serbian conflict . i caught end this film cable channel it forever imprinted my memory . after watching film again beginning end it become one my favorite " war " type films , realistic , dark gritty . if you like owen wilson prepared shock . many films he cast comedic roles jackie chan films , zoolander wedding crashers but this film shows true depth his abilities serious actor . this far my favorite owen wison film .	1
not your typical thriller ( where car chases .. ) . lord war constructed like documentary plot . cage excellent , so screenplay . movie not-so-subtly speaks against war , arm dealings , developed countries making quick buck misery genocide civil wars while same time hypocriticaly imposing embargos , sanctions , etc . prepared strong language , lot violence sexuality - all which give really gritty surface otherwise sleek story . many quotable one-liners fast pace make it solid entertainment , if you call it this thought-provoking drama .	1
sometimes sequels inferior original but not this case . this 4th inspector clouseau movie ( after pink panther , shot dark , pink panther returns ) they perfected it . combination action , clumsiness peter sellers character , music score henry mancini , fight scenes kato , crazy inspector dreyfuss course classic " your dog bite ? " all there right amount combination . also , movie set during time it filmed which 1976 . if you only own pink panther movie ever , this one . previous three movies funny but imo drag bit times . next one after this one ( revenge pink panther ) came close this one but never eclipsed it	1
this criterion edition includes interveiw forman sheds lot light how this film constructed . use long singles , especially when pianist mother father dialogue , undoubtedly influenced budget constraints , but forman makes aesthetic choice linger mother while she wears down all around her her world-weary nagging . effect you get share what husband , son protagonist going through ; " get me away this woman , please ! " expressions faces both professionals amateurs cast tell story not only drudgery under oppressive political regime , but hopes despairs people suffer kind fraught romantic episodes story woven around . andula story not quite compelling enough justify price tag this dvd - there whole episode involving missing ring enraged suitor pops up disappears without much relevance . modern cinema-goers expect more meat story , i think . however , budding filmmakers learn lot pacing , reaction actors , not moving camera , difference directing professional non-professional actors ( extras interview ) .	1
better move over angelina jolie , asia argento here !! this woman not only sexy , beautiful , vulnerable innocent all same time , but oh so talented . she seems just pour herself right into part . i seen some her other performances this definitely not one movie or one character wonder . if she get commercially viable project then oscar got new leading lady . aside asia , . monkey superb movie splendidly developed love story . it bloody wonderful watch characters change , become exposed draw close one . passion , sensitivity , discovery , growth , intensity , tragedy , love , what more one want ? oh yea , i mention asia	1
i've always big fan arnold , this movie really lets him shine . one highlight ( many film ) confusing/embarrassing scene where arnold misunderstands invited over professor his daughter " tea " ( beatnik-era term marijuana ) . then there sordid scene where booze-addled arnold confesses what he saw hotel room he shares hercules . this scene alone whisks movie out kiddie genre it seems lumped into takes it level completely . yes , pretzy , arnold stang delivers spades . then there arnold schwarzenegger . his english wasn't very good time this made , but this ain't shakespeare he reciting , either . even this early point his career , it obvious man makings actor or politician . fact this movie made 1970 , long after peplum craze over gives it added appeal me . also , character hercules this movie big , strong lummox instead noble hero truer greek mythology than most movies portray him makes it my favorite genre . scene where he mini-tantrum after losing weight lifting competition , stamping his feet giving good herman munster " darn , darn , darn ! " impersonation fine example . although you listen arnold original audio , i prefer dubbed dad-voiced audio option myself . other favorite scenes : hercules falling outside airplane window waving old lady passenger plane , scene times square where hercules takes off his shirt makes his pecs move up down professor daughter .	1

frequent visitor himalayas closely touch both tibetans ( ordinary folks , not tortured ones ) chinese , i find this documentary interesting but terribly one-sided . i not met single wealthy tibetan nepal or india , who swear me he return freed tibet , run their government exile . fair " experts " , lot evidence chinese violence against tibetans real . i sincerely feel sorry them wish they could somehow compensated . however , documentary gets emotive it seems bent presenting situation tibet entirely viewpoint activists other victims chinese aggression . while it true many tibetans suffered died during invasion subsequent crushing riots erupted time time , it unfair assume soldiers police only ones responsible deaths injuries . there no looters , vandals , infighting ? if you ever witnessed these riots , would you think more people might hurt or killed soldiers not opened fire ? it also incredibly naive assume all tibetans think same . even dharamsala , seat tibetan government exile not without opposition , violence even assasination . while i think most tibetans good buddhists nice people , documentary seems associate everything sinful chinese everything saintly tibetans . this something i find totally unacceptable . few snapshots tibetan mobs welcoming delegates exile tell us nothing . documentary seems only able find tibetans who against chinese rule . they paint picture nobody tibet happy . this patently untrue . but then , this sort thing sells america . you demon , you damsel distress you must hero ( america this case ) . otherwise , it just won't sell . it not compassion all . if you really want " illuminated " , visit tibet tibetan communities all over china see things yourself . would far more enlightening . sadly , many journalists prefer interview wrong ( right ? ) people order get sensational story pay rent	-1

i would gladly take my hour half back . i enjoyed humor st 1 , there only nod direction here - so lame , it only serves draw attention its absence . also , this turns into slasher flick - systematic knock-off each characters exploration how gruesome special effects . now , i'm not necessarily against this , though i don't really care slasher flicks , other than say it becomes super bo-ring ! i mean boringthere not even really " " movie quality here provides something memorable . nope - nothing redeeming here . don't bother	-1

rock who this movie looking malnourished rotted teeth sinister contact lenses make-up ? this movie horrible . but , it typical van damme flick . horrible acting , over-produced cheesy waxy feel it , non-existent storyline usual idiotic ending . i admit though , i most van damme movies . he decent martial artist . my opinion his best movies " kickboxer " " bloodsport " . these his only movies actually enjoyable watch somewhat inspiring . i few observations / comments / questions make should humorous seasoned van damme fan : isn't it funny all his millions dollars van damme can't find plastic surgeon who hide silly bump his forehead ... why must every character van damme plays speak french accent ? he tries play wide variety different action hero roles but always character must some way originate france . isn't this preposterous ? you'd think if van damme serious his " acting " career he would attempted remedy this flaw . i mean , it not like his acting roles all challenging but it would nice if he even partially believable his roles ... why van damme always show his bare rear-end so much ? he think women watching his silly movies ? you'd think someone would realize mostly men watch action films majority men no desire see his naked backside so why show it ? ... it me or van damme need good hair stylist ? his hair especially stupid cyborg . he looks like he should cast " revenge nerds " ... speaking style , it van damme himself who invented stupid tucked shirt pleated dockers pulled up way too high over waist snazzy belt 80 look ? if so , this deed alone he should reprimanded ... why van damme such huge action hero ? he so friggin ' short if you saw him line behind you convenience store i don't think he would look all intimidating . least steven seagal tall tough looking although van damme definitely better shape . you never see seagal showing his muscles .... lastly , even though i laugh van damme i am definitely fan . said , i wonder if any his other fans share my sentiments producers , directors just everyone else involved most his many films . i think they should ashamed way they their work . van damme alot heart , maybe not so much stallone , but more heart than most action heroes like shwarzenegger , etc . people involved most van damme films truly disservice him action film fans everywhere . they should taken pride their work . it not like they weren't paid handsomely their services	-1
big fan roeg , bowie , sci-fi general , i intrigued enough purchase new criterion edition blind buy ( also aided my decision some positive reviews friends whose opinion i trust ) . overall , i think it great decision , if bit pricey . david bowie stars thomas jerome newton , who we first see stumbling around disoriented earth . he technical genius privately arranges meet one oliver farnsworth - scientific breakthrough lofty business plan mind . farnsworth quickly becomes his company manager begins amassing wealth thomas , who wants become rich reasons known only him . scientist , nathan bryce , also commissioned part research development - this time space project . around same time thomas meets young naive girl , mary lou , who helps save his life cares him ( eventually becomes his lover , despite thomas wife ) . while all this going , rival corporation noticed newton success keen bring his empire technology down . course , film like this , none matters all . that because thomas [ i]presumably[/i ] alien who come earth order save his small desert planet his family , who appear only survivors after two successive nuclear wars wrecked havoc planet atmosphere . i say " presumably " because , despite obvious ( scene his eyes , i say no more ) subtle ( his constant need water , his reactions moving fast speed ) visual performance/dialogue clues , film ends rather ambiguously this crucial point . my mind , possible layer newton not alien all rather fascinating . however , if taken surface only , nicolas roeg concocted visually sonically impressive sci-fi classic , fine appropriate misanthropic moody performance david bowie . roeg takes his time develop story around loose framework novel but uses number interesting visuals abstract imagery/metaphor order convey his major themes - loneliness vices man , ruthlessness corporate commercial world , way we would potentially react such visitor ( malice ) . other major theme , course , sexuality power sex destroy ; bryce considered problem because his taste very young women , newton fateful encounter mary lou , however control he may appear first , ends up doing same she introduces him joys follies human sexuality also alcohol ( which screws his system causes hallucinations - much like real life us humans , eh ? ) . film not without flaws . there number bizarre dialogue exchanges , especially newton mary lou , nothing enhance plot or development either character . one particularly fascinating but pretentious sex scene , using gun lot firing blanks sexual allegory , goes forever utterly pointless without context stage film . strange disturbing visual cues abound some particularly effective , but frequent use naked bodies writhing around some kind oatmeal throughout film silly . not nearly enough time spent reasons motivations how exactly newton intends save his planet . still , straightforward linear film would far less compelling not what roeg intended make anyway . it said writer accompanying interview roeg let spirit book guide his choices , large extent true ; he remain faithful [ i]spirit[/i ] narrative not deviate central plot . his distinct visual sense astonishing behold those unfamiliar his work . however , grade film dips slightly because flaws outlined above regard pacing , structure , story . despite all , i'm glad i bought it look forward seeing it again commentary order absorb all details i missed first time . excellent but difficult challenging piece science fiction visionary director - it amazing think " star wars " only year away ....	1

i am young actor europe , sweden i got uta books , respect acting , challenge actor previously my purchase dvd , uta hagan acting class . so , i already read through her books when i got dvd which i felt when viewing dvd must understand dvd . dvd not technical help tool show you how warm up or prepare play role or audition i thought it would . instead it quite amazing thing because you very first minute dvd walk straight into hb studio classroom view everything if you doing sit course you might interested . one then watch her students first get some instructions each exercise she then they based chosen exercise go up stage play dialogues against each other . after some minutes she stop students instead telling them what they wrong ask them if there something they could criticize what they just , why they believe it so ? after students talked their understandings she fill her own give very honest answer everyone . it obvious she knows what she doing her feedback always based how students reached goal exercises or not . i would say it worth buying if one serious acting but if one live close ny i would say you better off saving those money instead go down her studio , hb studio use those money classes ! i don't know how other teachers school but her exercises , her technique i feel just so authentic great something every actor serious his or her acting should master ! only thing this dvd not so good it copy old video 1970 i understand so style sound recording not greatest or up date today fashion . however , real actor probably irrelevant . so , overall i feeel it great dvd i give it 4 5uta created amazing technique based internal acting i feel leads authentic truth like behavior stage . i most definitely go ny take her class ! good luck all actors actresses world ! maybe i'll see you ny !	1
not knowing what expect this movie i went open mind . i amazingly pleased everything this film . it exceeded my every expectation more . chain crimes begins when dishonorable man named mainardi ( george hilton ) blackmails serial killer ( michel antoine ) into murdering his wife . after young couple ( alessio orano cristina galb�) burglarize murderer car , newly deceased corpse its trunk , killer sets off maniacal crime spree . film moves steady clip , camera movements slick professional cinematography makes great use shadow create atmosphere heighten tension . film receives stunning 2.35.1 anamorphic widescreen transfer taken film original negative . aside some really minor print damage shows up form odd speck here there , very occasional scratch , this transfer looks amazing . acting good all around , however , antoine steals show magnificent cruel , conscienceless killer . cozzi direction also brilliant he pays homage great dario argento initials d.a killers lighter . " killer must kill again " ( otherwise known " il ragno " , or " spider " ) great 70 giallo classic fans genre certainly enjoy .	1
talk challenge ! make movie which , all purposes , really no beginning ( " fellowship ring " ) no end ( " " return king " ) hard enough . try living up bar set forth its prequel ! this movie spectactular , although it really should watched context least first movie . extra scenes ( 45 minutes worth ) spectacular , extras dvds masterful . i'm type likes know much i whatever i'm watching , i extremely satisfied this set .	1
ray bradbury never lucky movies . read his science fiction classic instead watching this dull adaptation	-1
i came across this movie all chance it certainly became one my all-time favorites . beyond everything else this movie soooo well-done . it truly satisfies every aspect . economy director used telling this story i think just perfect . it sad , it haunting , it gripping , thick magnificent ambient dread it features 2 mind-blowing performances leads . it really hard decide which actor better but i'd say you see kim stanley superb work believe it ! i blown away ! if you like off-beat , eerie movies solid stories tour de force acting you surely love this one ! not hesitate rent it	1
one first vampire series some interesting storylines ( few oddities here there ) since this season one you usually wouldnt expect much but since i seen own trilogy i tell you season 1 3 all thats really needed full story unless you die hard fan like me em all . some best features this set episodes nick attempting become human yet again finale nick bear decision whether or not turn his friend , his love , into vampire ! so sure buy this set if you buy season one . reason i say pt 3 needed because it end conclusion story even though it wasn't what i'd hoped it would it , always my favorite older vamp series didnt need big buget special effects win you over .	1

late 1960s academy award winner clint eastwood ( pale rider , unforgiven ) certainly established himself actor such features good , bad ugly ( 1966 ) , hang ' em high ( 1968 ) , where eagles dare ( 1968 ) before also taking role director his film play misty me ( 1971 ) . high plains drifter ( 1973 ) eastwood 2nd directing gig , written ernest tidyman ( shaft , french connection ) featuring eastwood himself . also appearing verna bloom ( animal house ) , geoffrey lewis ( every which way but loose ) , marianna hill ( schizoid ) , mitch ryan ( lethal weapon ) , jack ging ( sssssss ) , stefan gierasch ( silver streak ) , ted hartley ( ice station zebra ) , walter barnes ( every which way but loose ) , anthony james ( unforgiven ) , dan vadis ( bronco billy ) , billy curtis , one many little people featured film wizard oz ( 1939 ) . film , which takes place seaside mining town known lago , begins we see lone horseback rider ( eastwood ) traveling across shimmering desert landscape , making his way towards town . his arrival draws much attention , particularly three gun-toting yahoos who , after getting uppity stranger , soon find themselves dead . turns out trio weren't just you run mill riff raff , but gunmen hired town protection , specifically against three other men , soon released prison , who townsfolk believe return revenge ( seems three men currently prison once held position three now deceased men held , before particular incident occurred they railroaded into jail ) . anyway , town leaders , now without their hired guns , decide offer stranger position protectorate , given ease which he dispatched their previous choices , stranger accepts only after promised complete run town . deal seems like good one , until stranger starts taking liberties above beyond what they believe fair equitable , causing consternation among more than few residents ( result townspeople start turning each other ) . stranger begins making good his end bargain ( setting up drills such men town ) , three men , including stacey bridges ( lewis ) his cousins cole dan carlin ( james vadis , respectively ) released prison proceed make their way towards lago , their intent seek reparations against town them wrong . town prepares their arrival ( including spiffy , new paint job , stranger behest ) , we continue learn more more past incident within town , one gruesome secret shared all , rationalized away most . me this very straightforward tale what goes around , comes around , especially terms everyone lago getting exactly what they deserved based their level involvement past , unspeakable events . i've stuff my life come back bite me ash , but never extent depicted here ... then again i never found myself position either participating or witnessing brutal crime ( doing nothing help ) . various points film eastwood character identity questioned , which it never flat out specified but given key aspects film it seemed pretty obvious me . short dream sequence early one should provide good idea where his character coming if not , then final sequence should ( hint , there metaphysical element involved ) . while eastwood character here not name , aspect not meant reflect some his earlier italian made westerns where his character generally not identified characters there here not same . there plenty nastiness film including some whippings , cold-blooded murders , acts misogyny , so , but interestingly enough , they all seem their place within story , especially given what we learn terms despicable secret most all town share . that not say all actions stranger justified but given underlying circumstances they weren't entirely unexpected . overall i think i pretty good handle characters ( their motivations , where they coming , etc . ) , except one female character played marianna hill , who seemed real weirdo . her character would glom onto most dominant male figure present which she would then seem resent them , particularly so stranger , but perhaps this result eastwood character interest her superficial best , something which she felt wasn't accustomed . regardless , she one those women who should wear sign around her neck stating `look , but don't touch ' . far eastwood , well , he eastwood , presents himself much one would expect role like this ( cool , distant , enigmatic ) . i thought his direction wonderful his performance . far rest cast , primarily made up character actors , i thought they all very well , story provided just enough material attention each given their respective roles within film . my favorite part film , besides confrontation sequence end , comes near beginning eastwood character arrives into town , enters saloon , begins getting verbally hassled three roughnecks which he brushes them off heads off shave bath , three troublemakers not far behind . they continue verbal jabs , when they fail get rise out him , they turn violent , forcing stranger react , resulting lesson learned all not mess bull lest you get horns . all all i thought this great film , one better westerns come out 1970s . picture , presented widescreen ( 2.35 : 1 ) , looks pretty decent , but could used little cleaning up , my opinion , there slight flaws present throughout ( when i say `slight flaws ' , i mean minor dust flecks such , but nothing overly obvious ) . audio , presented dolby digital 2.0 mono , both english french , comes through very well . far extras there production notes , cast crew biographies , theatrical trailer , subtitles english spanish . cookieman108	1

when i review movie , i look issues family traditional values discuss picture . this rather obscure canadian movie so it pretty hard find - maybe looking amazon.ca would more productive - looks matter sickness death point view fifteen-year-old girl , tamara . her artist father moves them into house where teenage son owners died leukemia . shortly after moving , tamara mother diagnosed tuberculosis leave family sanitarium . so , tamara her younger brother sister face number issues this movie - moving new location , going new school , dealing serious illness , etc . it happens neighbors across road them ( supposedly ) baptists so tamara soon faced issue religion . [ her mother avowed atheist , but wise enough let tamara decide herself whether go church or not . ] evangelical christian families , this family presents some interesting issues . kids swear like military sailor . what kind christian testimony ? when tamara starts pick up some language , her father no uncertain terms let her know she not use kind language . it really their fruits one knows godly person , not their religious doctrines ? there one delightful scene where three girls two boys go skinny-dipping farm pond . ( my father grew up skinny-dipping , my wife i well , all our kids now my grandchildren continuing tradition , so , course , i could relate . ) this not erotic scene - tamara her siblings , it just way they swam . baptist brother sister , i think there bit rebellion involved . when baptist father discovered them , he " blew his stack . " i feeling if tamara father discovered them , he would joined kids cooling off ! after watching hundreds movies dealing children , it also refreshing see one where children both parents . not only , they both very loving parents . course , her age , tamara really angry her father - how well i know . ( when my oldest daughter fifteen , i worst dad any girl could gotten stuck ; when she her first baby go back work , i one she wanted care her precious bundle . ) still tamara dad patient understanding ; willing show his love giving her hug when she needed it . i understand it , director this movie ( real-life mother actress who plays tamara ) professional photographer . this movie little rough around edges , sometimes feeling disjointed , although framing scenes very good . yet , both my wife i could follow story . point movie question meaning illness untimely death . why some people pray get healed ; others pray still die ? why it , if god anything healing , religious person child dies while nonbeliever recovers ? this film never classic . nonetheless , it make you think . if you want fast-paced action , look elsewhere . if you like real human interest stories , this one film worth looking . issues dealing illness death , general family relations , this five-star movie . chopiness , due inexperience movie-maker , drops it four-star movie me .	1

" second chorus " not widely known film , but it probably enjoyable any fan fred astaire . if you're not particularly fond astaire , you might want pass this one since seeing astaire action unusual role main attraction . story danny o'neill ( fred astaire ) hank taylor ( burgess meredith ) leaders band . two intentionally failing college , because they like atmosphere , also because long they officially students they spend their time running band making pretty good living it . when ellen miller ( paulette goddard ) enters picture , they both get greedy want her attention themselves . thus they each double-cross other both wind up getting expelled university , thus ending their cozy arrangement their band . they spend most rest film continuing double-cross one , this time over trying get into artie shaw band well trying win over affections ellen , who now works shaw . end , danny hank patch things up decide work together , good results coming their teamwork . things not so great this film mainly quality video , less than great comic timing , tiresome scenes . lester chisholm , played charles butterworth . mr. butterworth no edward everett horton , less-than-adequate character actor you just want shoo guy off stage every time he turns up . also , if you're watching this film see lots astaire wonderful dancing , you'll likely somewhat disappointed . he some singing dancing , but this film mainly shows off his comic abilities , which mischievous astaire plenty . this part would better if comic timing script tighter , though . second feature , " that dancing " documentary made 1985 same lines " that entertainment " . however , my humble opinion " that entertainment " it before it better . actually , this documentary seems bit drawn out lacks excitement its predecessor . however , you get see some good shots astaire others doing some pretty impressive dancing . considering low cost this double feature , ardent astaire fan it probably worth it	1

teen comedies always turn up big business box office , this generally due fact creative forces behind these movies include plenty crude humor , sex , nudity allowed under mpaa ratings system . most time these teen comedies dime-a-dozen , opening big fading shortly thereafter , little lasting appeal audiences . however , there some successes genre more staying power than others , examples would " animal house " , `scary movie ' franchise , `american pie ' series . those examples successful teen comedies , they all some common traits which they share , basically they packed full sex , nudity , crude humor language . however , one thing these examples successful teen comedies , even unsuccessful ones lack any amount heart or soul story . 2004 , fox studios produced yet teen comedy appease masses short while , " girl next door " . starring elisha cuthbert ( tv " 24 " ) unknown lead actor named emile hirsch , " girl next door " would stand out other teen comedies come before it or even after it , this movie contained one thing i said lacking those others , heart soul . " girl next door " story 18-year-old matthew kidman ( emile hirsch ) , straight-laced , overachieving , good boy who never really lived life fullest . , until he spies his incredibly sexy neighbor ( elisha cuthbert ) changing window , finds through his desire her , he anything everything her . but , matthew gets thrown somewhat loop when he discovers his perfect `girl next door ' actually former porn star , who trying forget life she used lead . now , matthew sheltered life quickly begins spin out control he attempts help his new girlfriend leave life she knew embrace life she longs . reason i feel this movie far above those other teen comedies i listed , some which i enjoyed way , like i said earlier " girl next door " contains plenty heart soul its story . this movie isn't simply sex , yes there obligatory teen comedy element this movie , but this movie actually discovery sex isn't only thing look relationship someone . prove point main character story , matthew , who way played perfectly emile hirsch , forced learn true meaningful relationship woman , he must get past his lustful desire only want physical body , no regard emotional side woman . lesson he learn hard way , it forces his character mature throughout story , until finally he able committed relationship this `girl next door ' , he discovers she more than just beautiful woman , former porn star , fact she person real feelings . all she asks matthew he move past her former life see her who she truly . writing this story better than most contained this type movie , generally story fairly thin , pretty much there link each crude joke next or bridge gap sex scenes ; however , this movie story main focus , yes there crude jokes couple sex scenes , but story isn't simply minor plot device get audience these obligatory teen comedy sequences . actors all very good job bringing their characters life , appear enjoying themselves immensely roles they've given . elisha cuthbert emile hirsch share great chemistry helps elevate this movie almost romantic comedy level , instead just teen comedy . timothy olyphant ( " man apart " " scream 2 " ) makes several appearances throughout film shady porn producer , he manages steal almost every scene he , actually provides matthew some rather sage advice , though inadvertently i might add . if you fan teen comedies , but perhaps tired same old thing , then check out " girl next door " , i promise you it more than your average teen , gross-out sex comedy . " girl next door " available both rated unrated editions , both contain language sexuality/nudity	1

this got , without doubt , stupidest most boring piece trash ever make celluloid . what waste time ! it over 10 years since i walked out any movie , but i just couldn't take it any more ! garbage , garbage , garbage ! i read reviews call this movie masterpiece thriller ?? there nothing thrilling this movie all-except fact your just hoping it end some time real soon . talk movie drags !. why anybody would call this " film " anything other than crap completely beyond me . you can't even understand what these characters saying ! ralph fiennes just mumbles , mumbles , mumbles whole time . all he walk around city remember his stupid childhood . father making out prostitute some ramshackle cabin discovered mother , who just stands doorway watching . without word or so much argument or confrontation , father just picks up shovel whacks her head it . boom dead ! why ?? who knows ?? if he wanted her dead so bad he years it . father isn't even shown abusive before . prostitute ? she just starts laughing like it no big deal . then they walk down street his house , drunk laughing ! oh humanity ! dad takes hooker home tells his kid it his new " mommy " ? kid ( spider ) frieken 10 years old or so .... like he really gonna buy into ?? then hooker yells spider tells him daddy killed his mommy ? who would this ? all we get these looooong boring scenes adult spider ( ralph fiennes ) putting puzzles together , mumbling , wrapping himself up newspaper his dingy room . retarded-and very very boring !!!!!!! david cronenburg should not allowed ever direct movie his lifetime after making this heap dung . what he thinking ?? what they all thinking !! absolutely worst - most boring- uninspired movie i seen years . spider so bad it just made me furious ! i felt like i dying long , slow , torturous death !! spider should squashed like bug before production completed . nothing but junk !	-1
i disagree negative reviews this one big time . concert awesome ! picture sound great my tv/stereo system . although different than their concerts late ' 80 early ' 90 ( one should expect ) , jon , always , crowd singing , dancing , waving their arms unison ( not so unison times , lol ) even though it pouring rain fans ( some band ) getting soaked he exhibited his expertise front man he so well . if you looking origional ( cd ) versions not variations or " strays " their songs ( especially their infamous hits yester-year ) , this not cd provide ( though you shouldn't disappointed ) . just note variations mostly , rockers still rockers only 1 exception i think - i especially loved " runaway " rendition - it hauntingly beautiful ballad blew me away i'd buy this dvd again song alone . just their self stated anthem " just older " all i think bon jovi music reflects their maturity band it especially reflects their musical talent genius . fact they now playing 2 generations audiences , many which thought " crush " their first cd , fantastic says lot band their talent their ability appeal more than " just older " crowd ( just check out all young faces crowd absolutely thrilled there rain ) . i also thought it cool concert also broadcast over radio , i sure wish bands here . they played 19 songs total ( i rarely went concert where band played 19 songs - especially rain ! - i've quite few concerts past ) , 3 song encore ( " keep faith " rocked ! ) . awesome fire works show end concert band leaves while " thank you loving me " plays background ... nice touch ending . also interviews , pictures , more dvd . get it while you , it well worth it ! jon , richie , david , tico , hugh ... my hat off you all ! i wish i could there	1
it pretty cool . it way better then first one . i seen it before movie theater some my friends . i just blown away it .

after criticized producing mostly spoof movies , mel brooks departed genre returned semi-real world his early two films " producers " " twelve chairs .

this movie my favorite movie . ever . i feel terrible giving it two stars . but it gets 2 stars because i am comparing it rhino version , which i also own . i also own original vhs . i watched this movie least once year since i 8 except 6 years middle school/hs . i sit class watch it memory my head . buy rhino version . if you can't find rhino version , this isn't half bad . its just version much better , since i growing up older copies , new one flaws , minor newcomer , blinding me . i also am physically unable watch any " special edition " star wars because those changes , if gives clue my movie anality . buy rhino version if you find it . one complaint vhs this cool " glitter " effect couple scenes involving energon unicron internals . it present vhs , it came out wrong rhino version , totally gone 20th . thanks deleting part my childhood . comparison rhino version : remaster terrible . mine seems flicker strange artifacts . colors totally off . hot rod basically magenta/pink instead red his orange not orange like orange , it orange like cheaply made basketball . widescreen fake . it cut fullscreen . i wish you weren't such liar , sony . cover art : d- . no detail . looks like whoever new show drew it afternoon or two . matrix looks like honeydew . it would got but prime there . very few extras worth it . i bought this remaster , hoping some clean up restoration glitter effect , they weren't there	-1

so many folks already know plot resolution " tale two cities " , detailed review unnecessary . this may lessen suspense but should not diminish appreciation this fine movie . this well-done mgm classic old school . ttc set against french revolution 1789 , but absence french accents not detract . neither " paris " obviously shot hollywood back lot . ronald colman lead virtually carries picture . he plays slacker london lawyer who clears young frenchman , donald woods , trumped up charges . woods moved england escape treacherous atmosphere smoldering paris . woods ' uncle , played basil rathbone , planted fake charges . br over top effete , haughty , snobbish french aristocrat . colman woods love same young woman , elizabeth allen , crux ttc . woods wins her hand but makes mistake returning paris-and promptly thrown into cooler sentenced death . prove his amour allen , colman visits woods prison -and switches places waiting list guillotine ! subrogation completely believable , not maudlin least . ttc moves briskly ; most not notice two-hour run time . less time would inadequate involved plot . it , viewers should still watch ttc closely fullest appreciation . some key scenes brief ! ttc shot beautiful black white-perfect gloomy subject matter . why anyone would colorize-or remake ! - this classic mystery . original cannot improved upon . this reviewer so impressed film , he bought book , perfect compliment/complement any self-respecting movie	1

i watched " camille " " four horsemen apocolypse " only because i never seen rudolph valentino film curious see what all fuss . now i know . i purchased " son sheik " , after seeing it several times , am captivated his charisma just like thousands before me through years . course , it bit corny several parts such fast motion they comical ; but , if accepted fantasy it , it truly beautiful , sexy romance . i've seen many reviews which his facial expressions thought comical ; but , most part , i mesmerized sexual tension came across those georgeos eyes ! when he first brings his dancing girl his camp lights his cigarette slowly takes off his belt while watching her over his shoulder smoldering stare , i actually felt fluttery would loved girl ! i not , personally , seen any male hear t-t hrob since valentino , present day , come even close rivaling his natural ability project such sensuality screen . raised eyebrow ! whew ! i now purchased " sheik " see where story all began . can't wait get carried away again	1
i must say i am taken aback many negative comments thrown this film . what many reviewers miss fact , aside western , this also story which duke plays opposite strong woman . there constant trading off two who upper hand -- duke not realizing just when he thinks he put ann-margaret her place she deceiving him toward her own purposes all . compared quiet american , mclintock , donovan reef , hatari true grit , this one film where duke doesn't exactly carry day over his female interest . therefore , it quite refreshing its own way . unlike other reviewers , i remember this film more fondly i others 1970's--including shootest . terms movie cowboys whom times passing ( duke terms which hollywood leaving him behind ) , i prefer remember aging john wayne this way . even outwitted one hell woman , john wayne more dignity himself than pretenders who followed . ( yes , i mean you , kevin costner . )	1
i've wanting this since show canceled . its just too bad there isn't anything past season	1
this great , sexy , mystery thriller really keeps you your toes . there no pointless panning dialogue leading up excitement film opens intense car chase . james spader keeps your attention fullest introverted former cop john parker his cool demeanor rye wit , keeping you guessing what hell going through his mind . spader you engrossed role so much you find yourself shoes john parker- getting away small mountain town , clearing your head painful divorce tragic loss partner , getting wrapped up steamy romantic affair , suddenly running aftermath bank robbery whole town shaken up . if approached wrong way , some dialogue scenarios may come accross somewhat corny , but it really modern action-mystery movie style 1940 black white mystery movie . even soundtrack gives it vibe black white picture . good own because you'll probably want view it multiple times .	1
i hated this movie . not one character redeeming quality . mom aging hippie denial who smokes pot boffs rock stars half her age . rock star self-centered self-important no talent . son playing kissy face impossibly beautiful co-worker . daughter-in-law playing kissy face rock star mom ! dialogue sounds written original music atrocious . only good thing i got out this discovery t-rex song i previously unaware .	-1
forget multitude indiscretions jfk may committed his sadly short life watch this film . it tells story cuban missile crisis 1962 . it isn't 100% accurate . kevin costners character never existed , although it may mixture number actual real-life people . however what it shows , some great performances , how close nuclear catastrophy we came 1962 . i only one time , so no personal recollection events , but if this film 50% true then we should all grateful jfk power not bush . jfk mostly lone voice government full hawks who advising him go all out nuclear first strike . jfk went behind their backs deal russians . course if you believe all out nuclear war sensible option then you hate this film . rest us though , this very well made film shows how great politician kennedy really	1
if you fan temps this dvd must . great footage , otis fantastic giving us look inside motown .	1
this honestly one worst films i ever witnessed ... gay or straight . i am amazed it actually got made , let alone distributed ! i hate mean , but it hard watch ms. lesnick . her talents must lay elsewhere . she not act her way out box . oy !! she should stuck her rabbinical studies . seriously folks .... you should just rent it see how bad it ... you fascinated . i am sure helen lesnick lovely hard working woman , but what flat actress . her heavy black blue makeup made her look like drag queen fact she says she 34 film insane ! she clearly looked 45 + . i am all accepting yourself you age , but woman such deep lines her face , she looked like road map . if you force us stare your face 2 hrs ( tons annoying close ups !! oy again ! )please consider boxtex next time . well she got film made out there , starring herself lead . i am sure great accomplishment her ... but , painful us .	-1
i watched this show when it new loved it . now i am 25 i love it even more , subtleties humor great degree lost children , but adult i get jokes many more levels . i see why my parents laughing so hard	1
apart colin firth intense portrayal main character , this movie really lacking any substance . times it seems like it makes sense there thin plot grasp , but then too slips away . most psychological thrillers , things not what they seem . there several twists plot , but most them happen last 20 minutes movie , ultimately viewer left completely confused , rather than shocked intrigued . colin firth character wakes up week-long coma after car accident which he believes his girlfriend died . he meets mena suvari , who helps him cope his " trauma " , some reason attracted him despite his erratic mannerisms strange habits . filmmaking also little strange quite few slow-motion-esque shots . i wish i knew better way describe them . strange shots where maybe filmmaker only showing every 5th frame , but slow motion . it distracting not very aesthetically pleasing . there , however , very creepy dream sequence middle film defintiely pays off . dvd no extras all , unless you count previews subtitles	-1

ppm generously allowed some their concerts filmed so pbs could use them fund raising . where i first saw this program i dvd because it gets behind concerts show us how trio got together , how they work together , why they so unique , what they meant history united states ( lot other places , like el salvador ) . their music consistently called americans live into ideals stated founding documents our country compassionate all who not privileges white middle class americans enjoy . i not only agree them , i am energized them reach those good things . this dvd treasured retrospective their career crusades , i can't think any follower ppm all generations they touched who would not love it	1

" oh ohio " self-assured slice life touch viewers while disconcerting them all while . its comedic aspirations don't come full fruition its screenplay tad undercooked , but actors overcome this suave , easy charm . poking sly , understated fun overemphasis sex society , it neither prudish nor those who need slapstick find humor . sex may centrifugal force film , but this no " 40-year old virgin , " even though paul rudd plays similarly sympathetic characters each . priscilla chase , played parker posey , ambitious , ditzy woman fast track large-scale corporate success . however , dismay her schoolteacher husband jack , played rudd , she consummate cold fish . she may know exact number times they've sex , but she never single orgasm - ever - due " sexual dysfunction . " nor she seem interested doing so soon . things go up smoke . she may caused problem , but jack cannot get past fact one woman he not satisfied bed his wife ten years . after moving garage confiding his friend colleague popovitch , played cheeky delight keith david , he finally begins full-fledged separation priscilla when she becomes overly addicted vaginal vibrator . he moves manly arms apartment complex - " why settle mundane when you king your domain ? " - gives advances sophisticated 18-year old student kristen , played perfectly mischa barton , who lost her innocence long before he came . priscilla thus left find her sexual identity . she pursues sex random men , but she finds it unsatisfying . sex sex shop clerk justine , played heather graham , doesn't trick either . wayne pool guy , played zest warmth danny devito , however , puts entirely new spin things , awakening " parts cleveland " she never knew existed . wayne she finds liza minelli hoot her scene overzealous sex therapist , posey really brings it home when jack finally gives priscilla satisfaction missing their bedroom merely calling her cell phone during , all moments , important board meeting . it where phone specifically , course , matters . " oh ohio " equal parts raunchy touching it cloaks its characters genuine humanity . sex may come them , but it who they , not what they , matters end	1
i could not sit through this movie . acting screenplay terrible . this film could described bad made-for-tv movie best . i ended up fast-forwarding though entire movie after first 30 minutes turned player off before i reached end . i couldn't take it anymore . this movie one worst i've attempted watch long time . not recommended .	-1

room full . almost everybody filled their white styrofoam cups black coffee taken their seats . when i finally got nerve stand i felt so self-conscious i wanted crawl under my chair . " my name charley deriemer , " i finally said , " ... i ... uh ... i'm fan ... uh ... frighteners . " but i'm disappointed lot it , too . this horror-comedy too much humor wit not enough cheese qualify cult flick . all film computer generated flatulence , me , eventually loses impact . cgf so clutters up story-line , which already complicated , i think peter jackson , director , must fallen love his computer toys forgotten there story tell . it doesn't help while most movie over-the-top funny , last part sinks into old-fashioned scare-um gore-fest without cleverness , just jake busey grinning lot teeth people jumping out big knives their hands . so why this movie so likable ? first , most time script funny clever . second , several sequences manage create great blend humor , raunchiness , special effects drama ( funeral cemetery , museum party egyptian wing ) or real jolt dread foreboding ( lucy mansion patricia ann , beginning psychiatric hospital scene ) . third , movie some fine , grotesque acting weird unsettling ( jeffrey coombs , dee wallace , jake busey ) or weird funny ( john astin , chi mcbride , peter dobson ) . fourth , you can't beat love story reaches beyond death into eternal devotion . patricia ( dee wallace ) johnny ( jake busey ) , love forever means never say you're sorry . fifth , my mind most importantly , it michael . fox frank bannister . fox personality star firepower able turn typical nice-guy character into man we really like . fox master portraying flawed , vulnerable nice guys we almost instantly sympathize . it rare talent . me , he manages most time overcome continual show-off intrusion all computer generated overkill . exception when he involved massive tube heaven looks like slinky steroids . when he screen , even when he enmeshed silly blue-screen aerobics , he makes film human grounded . it shame jackson all money all those computers play . he didn't really need them . just watch how he builds dread when lucy arrives creepy old mansion whisk patricia away safety . it one best , most skillful scenes movie , there hardly computer effect seen until last it ... when dread suspense swept out " wow " stuff swept . there lot great stuff this comedy serial killers , demonic possession scamming psychic investigator who brings his own ghosts . there lot frustrated , too . most part , i just use my fast-forward button now them . i like movie even its faults . now if only someone would make , " johnny patricia versus mommy daddy , " featuring knife-wielding mommy leather-suited daddy people under stairs . would make tag-team match worth watching . original , basic dvd 110-minute theatrical release . there director cut 122-minutes which probably brainchild production company marketing department , division double-dips development . dvd transfer looks just fine	1
freddy one most three easily recognized horror movie characters world . most people don't know names movies , but they know glove . just like , they don't know friday 13th , but they know hockey mask . 1984 , horror world set fire nmoes original . how .... well i don't really know . i think this movie much better than original , my favorite out series here why . first , script much better . first movie ton holes it , dialogue characters seemed akwardly structured . it like akward group date person your friends want you meet , except your watching it . you know characters should saying something but they aren't . big problem time script . nancy tells her dad come over her house twenty mintues . during those 20 mintues she manages set up numerous booby traps catch freddy , heart heart conversation her mom , still 10 minutes fall asleep . second movie , script feels natural . there some pretty funny parts script , dialogue characters seems real . i understand these movies aren't oscar worthy but still . best example when girl asks male lead why he doesn't use key start his car . she says " well , someone could steal your car , couldn't they ? " then he says " deadly dinosaur ? " just way they talk sounds real , it not normal cheesy horror movie line . second thing this movie better acting . nancy first movie down right horrible . it not she bad actor . she great job chase sequences acting scared . where she faulters way she says lines . they just feel so forced , like your watching middle school play . when she yells " kruger !! kruger !! come get me you ..... b****d " it just feels akward . even when she says something simple like " sc**w sleep , or s***w your hall pass !!!

this movie made 1963 , if anyone tries judge movies 1963 todays standards they typically think movie boring slow moving . movie based true story , there book you read if you want more detail . you probably more great actors ( james garner , charles bronsan , mcqueen , attenborough , coburn , etc ) this one movie than you combined all hollywood today . today all special effects , blood guts more brutality better . imagine any movie today no cursing , would not get past screening room . listen richard attenborough classify all germans one enemy , not differentiate ss gestapo . we war all them , not just ss . teenagers drive todays movie market there few movies which keep their attention if there no special efects . this movie adult movie , plain simple . motorcycle scene awesome . i think steve mcqueen most it . richard attenborough one tough guy movie , you not steroid pumped up tough , you tough your mind . music score great , scenery great , actors great it entertaining movie . i really tried tell i enjoyed this movie it good movie . remember this movie made only 16 or so years after wwii	1

it important director immediately establish level trust his/her audience . we need believe we capable hands introduce us characters situations make perfect sense , events follow one unyielding logic . first , i felt decision made early film decision outside " trust " i described above . toward end film , i realized decision ok - even though i thought it bad idea filmmaker part make particular decision . i wish screenwriters worked harder come up different way get point point . problem " real " decision i lost faith director/story almost immediately because it appeared - time - utterly ridiculous . there scene where cat came jumping out closet shock value , my lord , i can't count number times where tired old trick used . whenever happens , i immediately think someone lazy can't come up better way give audience quick scare . besides - it quite awful leave cat locked up closet because they tend start using it their bathroom , you just can't get cat pee out * anything * . movie progressed , it began move fairly reasonable logic flow , i started gain trust director/story again , even though there some unnecessary characters scenes . dakota fanning ( emily ) , amazing actress whose ability portray wide range emotions many actors actresses years more training experience would give their left foot , perfect character part . we see her happy , we see her completely dead inside , we see her unbearably terrified . her tremors tears terrors ring true . she best actor film . ( which saying quite bit . ) movie man whose wife dies he moves country help his daughter cope . this didn't make sense me , because psychologist , father , david , ( deniro ) , should known just plain stupid . we don't see many emotions deniro after his wife dies , too disturbed me . again - i didn't feel capable hands , so i questioned everything looked wrong . while beautiful house country , emily what everyone calls imaginary friend - charlie . david frustrated this , few conversations former student his close emily . that where story starts pick up . charlie more more part emily life , david feels isolated . end , it seemed movie going " sixth sense " feel , it almost achieved it , but fell short . we're shown obligatory flashbacks , but they aren't convincing , shocking , or immediately understood those occurred shyamalan film . ( i saw " sixth sense " theater its opening weekend . i'm hard hearing , i wear headsets , thankfully , drown out idiots who like talk through films . however , those headsets couldn't keep me hearing shocked gasps audience . it shame shyamalan trying recreate same shock rest his films , because he failed miserably . ) if " hide seek " wasn't incorporating elemental template " sixth sense " , it would made more interesting film . or if " sixth sense " never made , it might more interesting . but i don't think it would much more interesting , because i said , flashbacks shocks those flashbacks supposed cause fell short . case point : " sixth sense " rating 8.2 imdb.pro, hide seek rating 5.5 . i tend trust those ratings , because members imdb.pro film aficionados , thousands people ( 129,000 ss 13,600 ) cast votes . it good sample .	-1

or not not one more well-known mel brooks films , but rip-roaring slightly naughty fun . it sets itself apart other mel brooks films superb , well- structured plot even some serious social commentary . mel plays lead role opposite stunning anne bancroft , his real-life wife . their personalities add real acting chemistry film . charles durning got academy award nomination best supporting actor his role gestapo commander . i really like " naughty nazis " number - hysterical	1
it worth attention ? definitely . it worth money ? absolutely . it worth effort ? certainly . it worth two years ? probably . it worth wait ? not really . it deserve last effort great late director ? unquestionably . plot eyes wide shut unfolds , tom cruise nicole kidman struggle attract audience attention . they attentively invite viewer into their fantasy world , which dreams might reality reality one single night becomes long unforgettable dream . good actor tom cruise this movie , nicole kidman manages steal show him . scene during which she reveals her husband how she would easily given up everything : him , her daughter , her life naval officer powerful combo her performances critically acclaimed die broadway play blue room . only flawed scene kidman alice , ex-gallery manager , who currently unemployed , sequence where she tells her husband she terrible nightmare . her sobs unemotional scene it not come out strong rest her performance . famously feared orgy scene indeed peculiar . it captures viewer attention , but it really needed ? scene serves little purpose conveying true message thin line imaginary real life . entire scenery inside rich mansion , where orgy scenes take place , where masked men pray hookers , fantastic regardless controversy its necessity . stanley kubrick , master filmmaking , gives imaginary twist marriage , dreams , reality life . but once viewer exits theater , he or she loss words thin line dream world reality disappears . such effect indeed kubrick last legacy .	1

good premise story line , most part decent dialog , outstanding acting ( except sleepwalking gyllenhaal ) , so what missing ? what missing plausibility . movie grief doesn't dwell it , but it must show early grief there . if this properly , viewer accept even most outlandish behavior character way dealing grief . kasdan it brilliantly ' big chill , ' mere thirty seconds glenn close sobbing shower . silbering failed anything like `moonlight mile , ' so eccentric parents goofy fiance seem uncaring preoccupied only themselves . i couldn't overcome it , even though i tried good while . time gyllenhaal bares his soul court it way too late ; what might otherwise quite affecting seems only outlandish .	-1

this televised ( pbs ) gala turned me casual , occasional opera listener into full-fledged fan . most specifically , it introduced me beauty splendor wagner . i recorded gala video , watched it time time over years . while pal version referred reviewer may contained entire performance , this dvd not . it comes awfully close , though . there missing arias which performed evening alfredo kraus ( werther aria ) , gwyneth jones ( " questa reggia " ) , vladimir chernov ( figaro aria barber seville ) , others -- most notably , wonderful " va pensiero " performed incomparable met chorus , cherubino aria wonderful fredrica von stade ( much better than selection included here her ) . but when you still close 5 hours glorious music like this , these complaints minor . this neophyte opera listener , i knew wagner composer rousing music used " apocalypse now " . i not prepared astonishing beauty prelude " rienzi " , which opens gala , nor could i believe intensity waltraud meier performance isolde " narrative curse " " tristan und isolde " . but it james morris ' performance " wotan farewell " which moved me near tears , which , noted earlier , turned me into devoted fan this music . there many other wonderful moments this dvd ( personal favorite : roberto alagna bryn terfel duet bizet " pearlfishers " ) . you probably won't watch this one sitting , but each performace , you thoroughly won over met orchestra . incredibly , unlike met centennial gala , which used many conductors , entire james levine 25th anniversary gala conducted maestro levine . may he grace pit metropolitan opera many years come . needless say , i couldn't recommend dvd release any more highly	1

i always under belief nascar racing most exciting sport world . nothing beats bunch guys hailing place like rock knob , nc driving circles four hours . i love it because i'm very simple . i used watch football , but game way too hard follow . they different things lot plays i don't get whole concept strong safety . why isn't other one called , weak or feeble safety ? you physically strongest safety ? anyway , that why i love nascar . you know what ? come here , i've got secret ya . tour de france even more exciting . this collection i got 12 hours guys riding bicycles , usually big pack . i don't get what they're doing because instead riders just riding really fast trying win themselves i gathered good riders teammates protect good rider . i personally would win all costs . i used murray bmx bike i won when i raced my friends even if it meant running their sorry butts into fence or parked car . like john creese says , " no mercy " . i'd sweep leg if needed . evidentally , there guy named lance armstrong wins this race every year he won it again this year . i didn't get why they knew he won week before race over . if he leading minute someone beat him more than minute , they should win . i don't get rules , but guys bikes hours upon hours sure fun watch	1

there comes time when you exposed film ... song ... photograph ... piece history sends you place where you either want ... or wish avoid . i saved film " aria " father day ... because when i began watch it six months ago i quickly enveloped aura nostalgia tugged my heart . i don't know how review such film " aria " . there never anything like it , nor there again . it cinematic brilliance ... cinematic brilliance ... cinematic brilliance . you get point ? it visual masterpiece ... musical masterpiece ... simply piece art ! i'd remiss if i told you it everyone . this one very much romantic ( sometimes erotic ) flick i would highly recommend hopeless romantics this planet . unfortunately , eliminates most men earth ... but not me . i don't remember last time i cried so much ... so hard ... so consistently ... than this operatic , eroti ,. connectic , endearing ... sometimes tragic epic . it filled love ... pain ... hope ... joy ... sprinkled passion ... eternal love ... lost dreams ... hopeful fantasies ... art ! many films left me speechless ... this one never find way keep my trap shut . maybe it romance me provoked tears ... but this film one goes straight heart ... soul ... ears tears . if you've ever love ... lost love ... yearned love ... or simply enjoyed thought love ... " aria " you . see it loving friend . i swear you'll swap tissues ... you'll hug ... you'll cry out loud ... that what makes this film such epic heart . what wrong tears ? what wrong wanting ... ... losing ... possessing strength eternal love passion ? isn't what life all ? all this captured without script . soul orchestrated operatic classics . it profound sound ... visual candy only cinematic artist could capture film . this one made pr ... me . it go down one finest films i ever seen . only one hint ... it series vignettes build intensity . star-studded cast includes many classic actors actresses ... but their challenge this ditty capture your heart without script . guess what ? they . here box . go out ... rent or buy this box ... some kleenex ... bottle chardonnay ... hold hand someone you love . i , regretably , home alone ... when i let stan ( my dog ) house after film ... he never received better back rub ( scratch behind ears ) . i'm still lost " aria " . tranquil mood ... imagery ... beautiful music live me forever . phew ! this one simply awesome !	1
i should known what expect " extreme " marketing phrases all over cover ... raw brutal , yeah right . i fully understand not wanting put out super produced dvd ( though i enjoy ones released their peers ) but these bootlegs horrible . sound too distorted ( not distorted guitars)in live footage ; even some music videos quality shotty best ( which inexcusable this era technology ) . if you want sound preserves more , pardon this word , " raw " feeling take cue bad religion " way " dvd . it soundboard , but that it . there lot comparisons " cliff ' em all " but come . tribute band member who passed away , bootlegs only choice . even so , it funny how bootlegs 1980 sound just good , sometimes better than , sound here . humor let down . all lyrics inner struggle self improvement one would expect something more than scenes puking someone window . , what , four minute clip other musicians saying shadows fall suck gay ? i teach 9th grade , i think even they would feel this humor too childish . i would only reccomend this dvd those who collect shadows fall . those us who like music would better off just listening albums . long live image attitude over substance	-1
without charm day , this film would fall flat , however it not case this musical . doris plays showgirl ethel ' dynamite ' jackson , who mistakenly offered chance appear cultural show paris .

i found this valuable collection my dance library . first segment teaches what many instructors fail teach- orientation smooth transitions early , this video guide you easily . transitions left right created teaching pivoting foot almost magically , creating smooth graceful dancing , no more boring dancer , learn dance all your audience , not just those facing you ! cross step use arms over head framing head , taxsim which much overlooked , hip pushes , beautiful traveling hip circles , undulations . second segment teaches funtastical drum solo , easy learn . it easy add this choreography make it more challenging . there so much this video , learn flow gracefully or bump beat drum , let beautiful neon guide you into spellbinding journey this mystical dance . overall , i totally enjoyed quality this video only improvements i would make would backdrop or setting which needed color . learning video easier my opinion if instructor faces mirror or works angle student follows . overall those minor compared all offered	1
ferrell crew really firing all cylinders here . anchorman funny bursts spurts , same old school , but this one keeps up fevered comedic pace up checkered flag . it makes fun french , jazz music , friends dorothy , but also makes fun nascar , rednecks , kfc , taco bell , applebee , but such way even people or things spoofed would enjoy this movie . dennis miller not funny long time , i remember he tried make joke dixie chicks , how their criticism war wouldn't go over nascar dads . but hey , dennis your agememnon references ruined monday night football those same nascar dads , you never go over them . ferrell go over them , even he parodies them , they love him , he slip some steve earle into soundtrack , it sound redneck but actually very subversive . ferrell totally get away all it . i watched this movie christmas my dad , he loved it , my nephew also received copy it christmas , he liked it too . there very touching father/son back story , it appeals all ages socio-economic backgrounds . i just realized french driver played guy who made borat . i hear he funny movie , too . let all get thrown out applebee's!!!	1
i've hoping release this series long time now , anxiously look forward other seasons , lot entertainment price	1
this pretty cute funny , really if i could i would given it 3.5 stars , but there not half star rating here . all all , it well put together .. vein fun old scooby doo cartoons i grew up . various worlds they visited during adventure added story kept you getting bored one scenario . i freely admit , i am more partial older ones .. they just seem little more solid me than current ones , but overall i think this good kids watch , they would fun it learn few things way .	1
this man far best guitar player i ever heard . more i hear better i like him . he makes one instrument sound like whole orchestra . he fun watch well . it very evident he enjoys what he doing i enjoy watching him perform	1

there much concern this series would never see light day . fox restored these films cable tv eye towards video release . however , when films first ran cable , there storm protest asian groups . they protested fact charlie chan not portrayed chinese actor ( although other chan family members played asians)and some his mannerisms might viewed stereotypical . defense these films , charlie chan always good guy he always outsmarted his opponents . films must viewed context era which they produced . they good clean fun . no bloody violence screen ! i am happy fox courage release these films dvd . interest them extraordinary . first two volumes moved top amazon sales charts within few days release . hopefully , all fox chans come dvd near future .	1
if you choosing which volumes keep , this one falls under must category , although second episode , " return babel " clearly stronger one . episode , we get return mark lenard spock father , reincarnation his previous role season one romulan commander who meets his doom pitting his wits against capt kirk . this time , lenard shows more staying power his new role ambassador sarek endure years come even through st : tos movies . what makes this episode very good also great acting newly departed jane wyatt who puts very heart-wrenching emotional performance her role spock human mother . plot also very good fast moving well making this overall one best episodes entire trekdom let alone second season must your collection . first episode isn't classic but it still some good points which includes surprise revelation end lt . uhura no less figuring something out combined grey matter kirk , spock bones failed which impressive . plot fast-moving premise interesting scottie gets hero change . overall , this solid volume 2 powerful episodes strength " return babel " must any tos collection . highly recommended	1
" professionals " last era westerns . it intelligent well written script , well directed richard brooks . what cast burt lancaster lee marvin both excellent aging mercenaries out one last mission . great supporting cast . my only regret i wish woody stode would little more role . unlike other films time genre characters honest heros , not antiheros . these honorable men doing tough dangerous job	1
ok , so i'll admit brad pitt accent not perfect there no way any ira man would pretty ( imagine if brad pitt looked like gerry adams - i doubt he would get many roles ) . but accent actually not bad , belfast people actually say " foks sake " quite frequently . i agree there some dubious moments plot action scenes little far fetched , but hey , this hollywood , there enough " gritty realism " feel imparted elsewhere distract viewer these minor inconsistencies . harrison ford plays same character he played patriot games / air force 1 / fugitive , which fine me since i enjoyed all those movies i am big harrison fan . i didn't find plot partucularly confusing ( it pretty straightforward really ) . although i certainly wouldn't venture say script delivers chapter verse hellishly complicated political situation . ireland , it least go some way explaining mechanisms ( personal revenge , indoctrination ) drive cycle violence there . bittersweet ending desired effect .	1
i loved this movie ! it wasn't scary i hoped but other than it fabulous ! lisa brenner gorgeous she shines ellen rimbaur ! it great prequel " rose red " , which also fantastic .	1

made pittance , initially released just two theaters , ultimately grossing over ten million dollars , " sweet sweetback baadasssss song " became progenitor " blaxploitation " film craze seventies . considered seminal film african-american cinema , director van peebles feels it influenced independent film movement whole . its jazzy editing strong hero set it miles apart standard fare - one see how african-american audiences could see this film long-overdue cinematic thunderbol t.t he plot simple . sweetback ( van peebles himself ) grown up bordello become one its central attractions . one night , he agrees accompany pair police officers downtown questioning . murder case lacks suspects , gesture appears compensation force lenience toward establishment . en route interrogation , however , police intercept youth street brutally beat him . using his handcuffs , sweetback kills both officers . rest protracted chase , sweetback using his fists ( among other body parts ) make his way border . police question his companions , hot his trail guns , bloodhounds ( one point ) helicopter . van peebles eye striking shot , there some vivid scenes police officers brutalizing sweetback friend beetle get their point across . while its historic contribution clear , " sweetback " little offer modern audiences beyond its kitsch value . van peebles strong presence laconic hero , but there not much way narrative or memorable characters savor . there plenty sex violence ( ' ' rating fully earned ) , but it episodic - much film seems enormous montage repeated street scenes dialogue clips , effect rapidly becomes tiresome . thirty years after its explosive release , " sweetback " remain compelling film historians students . its torch passed other filmmakers , but pioneering effort itself not dated well . ps - dvd release interview director . initially , it shares some formal similarities feature , but later it settles into some interesting ( amusing ) anecdotes . pps - i just saw " badasssss !

i am watching too many these italian movies . i am starting recognize people other movies familiar names actors/music/special effects other movies . i really should stop watching them because i really don't like them very much . i am more interested gore comedy these gore movies without humor " dead alive " or " terror firmer " tend bore me . this movie more straight gore fan . there someone stealing body parts hospital . there mad doctor taking off skull caps changing brains . there cannibalism . there machete stuck someone head self-defense . my favorite one main character using boat prop scramble zombie face . i wish there more things like this i might enjoyed it more . it poorly however . what i heard this popular cult favorite this type movie however makers seem made it without much inspiration besides making money . i really enjoy special features these types movies ( which i guess one big reason i continue watching these types italian gore movies i don't really like ) . i enjoy stories behind movies , etc . this one interview special effects person who i recognize zombi 2 bonus features ( i think it there ? ) . i am pretty sure interviews this zombi 2 same setting . it seemed me this probably right after interview zombi 2 . this one he seemed annoyed repeated questions zombi 2 interview . his attitude annoyed " i said before ...

not only diamonds forever worst connery bond film , it probably only surpassed moonraker worst all 007 movies made eon films . story far too complicated anyone keep track what going , relying too much return sean connery bond left producters director create parody their own films . after her majesty secret service not give good initial return their investment , evidently producers saltzman broccoli decided take step back direction you only live twice thunderball , but even further back than those 2 films ! result complete mess , bond movie would probably suited roger moore quite nicely , but shame see sean connery wasted such drivel . one saving grace this , 7th james bond movie , pre-credit sequence where bond hunting head spectre , blofeld , who responsible killing his wife tracy previous film . sum it all up : ernst stavro blofeld drag . need i say more	-1

this amazing quot ; behind musicquot ; dvd treasure chieftains fans , fans irish music , or fans great music general . their humor , candor willingness press limits their music not only makes this cd great viewing , but also helps explain their endless longevity . it lump-in-the-throat listen derek bell , recently departed , speculate he perhaps 20 more years live ( gone much too soon -- rest peace , dear friend ) . i can't recommend this wonderful dvd highly enough	1

this worst movie i've ever seen . i hardly ever write reviews , but i feel failing review this would like leaving spoiled milk refrigerator next poor fellow discover . that what this review , signpost warning my fellow man not see this movie . trust me . characters all horribly unlikeable , right get-go . here plot summary : because main character refuses open her mail , she evicted her house . she then , instead waiting our nation fine legal system fight through red tape get her house back , harasses house new owners , affair cop who no given motivation leaving his wife children . blah blah blah she gets drunk , takes owners hostage , befriends owners then takes bunch prescription meds . cop comes , blah blah blah family son gets shot , so parents kill themselves . lady who won't open her mail gets her house back . while i briefly considered getting drunk taking lots prescription meds after seeing this horribly depressing movie , i decided positively channel my negative energy into erecting this digital signpost , warning all mankind stay away this abomination film . zero star	-1
i love classic album series . they give you such great insight how band created their masterpieces . this time we given pleasure getting into queen classic album usual there some great interviews band members , producers , famous fans , record executives . i don't think this best classic album dvd but it still very good . you would expect , brian may gives most interesting information regarding making this album he also shows how he plays some sections . i little disappointed lack info given famed producer roy thomas baker . it would great hear freddie thoughts this album but hey , you can't everything . overall this definitely worth buying if you're into classic albums or queen . other great titles this series include deep purple machine head def leppard hysteria	1

" santa waiting , santa greeting , now you're nodding , now you're sleeping , you good mom dad , santa knows if you've bad ! " you won't able help but sing this fitting christmas song after watching this flick . dvd anchor bay put together pretty good . i'm only rating this first film mind . i haven't watched second one yet , but if i remember correctly what people said , half movie flashbacks . not good . avoid other 3 sequels well some not even related first . however , first film really creepy music , clear picture dvd transfer , several good moments enjoy . beginning where they visit grandfather creepy when he starts ranting how santa punishes bad children christmas eve . then billy parents killed robber santa suit same night . fast forward four years billy living orphanage strict , iron-handed mother superior who believes punishment necessary bad children ! fast forward ten years billy 18 working department store over christmas . after seeing fellow co-worker harrassed back room while flashbacks all horror he experienced when he younger , he finally snaps begins killing spree punish all bad ( including one antlers deer head hung wall ! ) holiday-themed film , i thought this pretty good . my favorite black christmas one much better far , but this one worth any true horror fans collection . even if it just all controversy it caused when it first released 1984 because they idea killer santa suit too much some people grasp . while i agree kids don't need see commerical advertisements posters suggest santa dangerous , this movie pure adult entertainment . kids go summer camp trick or treating , but i didn't see people complaining friday 13th or halloween films when those came out . silent night deadly night should not singled out because . parents simply don't need their kids watching this , end story . that why it rated . just reminder all parents santa not real ! we let kids believe he real mere fun it . isn't just bad ? check this one out horror fans	1

we should start making one thing clear : films zalman king no basis reality whatsoever ; they're erotic fantasies , pure simple . how else explain his casting choices leading roles his films : carrie otis , sherilyn fenn , david duchovony , richard tyson , bridgette bako , etc . people real life seldom sex appeal above-mentioned names . then there stories cloak these fine specimens , which almost always involve young innocent woman led down road sexual discovery , usually domineering though charming man , who she secretly lusted after sometime . what king films lack dramatic verve , they make up hitting their intended target : your libido . critics pounced like never before his feature film adaptation anais ninn erotic classic , ' delta venus . ' but they clearly missed point , ' delta venus ' isn't so much feature film , it most epic , most visually beautiful episode king 90s showtime series , ' red shoe diaries . ' context , it succeeds its fairly modest goals . set 1940s paris , ' venus ' introduces us aspiring writer named elena ( audie england ) . what appears morning ritual , she rushes banks sienne bitter january cold , muted urgency , one thing : watch handsome lawrence ( costas mandylor) -- man she yet meet --- row through foggy river . it isn't too long before she meets lawrence party thrown her agent , marcel ( eric da silva ) , discovers lawrence also writer , thriving , if controversial career . he , fact , leave france american tour support his latest effort --- but not before whirlwind affair elena , which far more profound effect her than she could ever imagined . lawrence gone , no money , no luck getting her stories published , elena crew friends --- artist , singer , their same-sex lovers --- suggest elena model nude cash . but marcel got more lucrative idea : she could write explict sex stories nameless collector erotica , who'll pay her handsomely it . ulitmately , elena accepts both offers , when collector , through marcel , insists graphic realism her stories , she ups ante her own sex life , fullfilling her desperate " desire plunge into living " " capable many loves . " audie england performance elena unfairly panned . she isn't great actress , but she just right mix doe-eyed innocence , restless intelligence , raw sensuality bubbling just beneath surface make her believeable . her initial scenes mandylor mildly touching , we see her teeter school-girl crush burning womanly desire . if nothing else , she least marked improvement over woozy carrie otis ' wild orchid . ' take how you may . costas mandylor really isn't this movie much , but he makes most what there . two chemistry , without which ' delta venus ' would really terrible critics said . granted , king doesn't always hit mark ' delta'--a sequence set party st. tropez particularly irritating his reach themes seem overextend his grasp . there definitely points which dialogue seem strain capture nin prose . critics also complained this film simply doesn't reflect reality life 1940s france . ( ugh . ) but counter , go back top this review read first sentence again . you really expecting zalman king give you blow-by-blow hitler invasion france ? if you're going this simply watch interesting love story -- turned beautiful cinematography , gorgeous actors , atmospheric lushness -- you not disappointed . fans tv show ' lost ' fans get kick out cameo made adewale akinnoyue-agbaje mysterious clairvoyant who gives ... special reading redheaded prostitute	1
don't get thrown first two reviews amazon posted this page . this dvd authorized release quality fantastic	1
kal penn cool i dig some his work , but this film very weak . i dig ta element , but storyline lack humor bored me . it only just ok best . i expected little something would crack me up . i knew it gonna just kinda there , but it didn't even really go anything but just ok	-1
those turning this film answer all questions last two episodes evangelion ( nge ) series didn't answer , i suggest you look elsewhere . if anything , this film provide you precious few answers but multitude new questions . those wanting highly provocative , thought-provoking , intelligent most poignant conclusion nge series , then no fear . i try explain some more perplexing elements this film , without giving too much away , well giving my thoughts opinions same time . film structured final two episodes series . so first half , ep . 25 " air/love destructive " concurrent series episode 25 " world ending/do you love me ? " . second half , ep . 26 . " my purest heart you/one more final : i need you " concurrent series episode 26 " beast shouted love heart world/take care yourself . " much like nge series , end evangelion ( eoe ) weaves complex story where images dialogue closely related philosophy symbolism . these themes played out through psychology each characters ' own mind . it essentially microcosm entire series . opening scenes before " air " title card ep . 25 shinji overlooking ruins city , then entering asuka hospital room , ( i'll leave it there ) set mood atmosphere . showing effectively very disturbingly this not going easy film . first half roars out gates breakneck speed , we see hostile takeover nerv seele organization each nerv member desperate attempt hold it bay . we also see mental states two main eva pilots - shinji asuka - reduced too . shinji severely depressed after killing last angel , kaworu , whom he formed close bond . asuka same mental boat shinji she sits bottom lake her eva , which she feels she can't pilot anymore . what interesting paths driven these two characters this point . ideas finding one self-worth ( examined perfectly final two series episodes ) , what happens person when taken away . same time seele trying initiate their plans third impact using unit-01 downright creepy looking mass-produced eva series , gendo his own plans involving rei lilith . asuka , ( little help inspiration her mama ) rages extremely violent battle evil evas , gendo takes rei down lilith . he this unite souls bodies adam lilith only find his scorned lover , ritsuko there . it interesting two most shocking violent scenes ( asuka/eva battle gendo/ritsuko confrontation ) played out bach beautiful " air " . infusion music this film truly brilliant major reason why many scenes so effective . however , this point film where most people start become completely lost . without really good understanding nge story ( perhaps even one ) , it hard not . it very difficult make extremely complex simple , however i'll try without many spoilers . suffice it say seele trying initiate third impact reduce humankind back its original form - primordial soup life where all souls beings one . gendo different plans just wanted see his ' dead ' wife , yui again . neither seele or gendo plans go exactly they meant . unit-01 , shinji , ends up becoming tree life , ark which all souls ushered through into lilith egg . understanding idea nge , humans - lilim , we're called - born lilith , rei essentially lilith helps make this clearer . what happening near this point 3rd impact occurring because unit-01 mass produced eva encounter . this returns geo-front ( sphere like cavern where nerv hq sits ) its original form , egg lilith ( we see this during " eye " -like explosion ) . after giant rei/lilith forms , shinji essentially given reign over future human race rei/lilith herself . this point , tempo film slows crawl most surreal images scenes begin creeping . even most seemingly simple scenes such young shinji playing sandbox swing , mountains , setting sun background just rife symbolism ( hint : try relate everything this scene something show , it scenes , characters , or themes ) . here , psychological interplay main characters crucial , shinji wishes played out real world . when he feels everyone deserted him essentially says ' everyone just die ' when instrumentality joining all souls through lilith really begins . what important note shinji thoughts after his ' choice ' made . place he escapes - world instrumentality where all souls one - his questioning this choice all his choices what we see here . more than just his questioning choice , we also hear him questioning meaning reality dreams . this not just random philosophical ramblings . it study character , well creator , thoughts feelings . shinji holds all humanity future his hands or , more accurately , his own mind . when you consider how psychologically scarred shinji , idea he completely shape future earth all humankind what makes this so interesting . once he allowed world he escapes , he faced choice whether stay or come back . he discusses these things rei kaworu ( lilith adam ) , we hear his final choice reasons why . ending eoe , titled " one more final : i need you " rightfully confusing almost everyone who sees it . however , it also perfect note end series . not only it leave us uncertain characters future , but it also expresses frustration realization shinji choice culmination all struggles lead them there . this film simply divine marvel . much like series it watched multiple times one uncover all its hidden layers meanings . but it doesn't lose its ability invoke emotions thoughts even after several viewings . there scenes immense power drama film - many match best most films i've seen . but i think it quiet moments make this film so moving memorable . sandbox scene one i've mentioned . live action shots monologue bach magnificent " jesus bleibet meine freude " ( jesus , joy man desiring ) playing piano it . even more subtle moments , such shinji sdat ( walkman type ) player out batteries ( more significant than many would think ) , gendo broken glasses rei place . vivid beginning instrumentality played out appropriate sad-song-with-a-pop-beat " komm susser tod " ( come sweet death ) , it these scenes never fail give me chills . there great quote goes something like " truly wise man always more questions than answers . " this series film asks more questions than it provides answers . what it tries make you think those questions , rather than provide easily digestible story . some may call story incoherent disjointed , but what many don't realize deep psychological philosophical leanings behind show inextricably linked storyline itself . so distinguish one other impossible without realizing how two intertwine effect other . if you merely try breakdown sci-fi storyline , then you confused much it . this because story so big so encompassing many finer details can't uncovered without diving deep into inner workings series . end , i only speak myself when i say nge superlative job doing everything great work art should . it made me laugh , it made me cry , it gave me chills more than one occasion .... but most all it made me think . anyone who wants enjoy this show just meaningless work science fiction so , but baffled they're crushed multiple layers extra contextual meanings . so , if you want understand nge , you not only pay close attention small details within show ( small scenes many episodes back play role film ) , you really open your mind up ideas presented , how they effect story . however , taken film , conclusion nge series , end evangelion staggering achievement powerful last testament what , my opinion , greatest visual series all time . * dvd notes : those considering whether buy just eoe or eoe/death rebirth 2-pack , i suggest you go eoe unless you don't own director cuts last several episodes ( available platinum collection ) . ' death ' mostly muddled re-crap entire series , while ' rebirth ' merely first 30 minutes eoe . death also doesn't contain remastered visuals or audio like platinum collection , so you'll getting low quality re-cap . death really doesn't even work introduction nge , because most everyone not aquainted previous episodes would confused structure recap . only thing worthwile ' death ' something called " magi archives " which provides great information key people , places , events , thing series . this very helpful those who feel completely lost all jargon series help clear some things up , even if it won't answer any bigger questions . so just stick eoe unless you feel need completeness get death rebirth well	1

first off , julia roberts me actress who become more beautiful age even this day . said , i anxious see this movie because her cameron diaz . i seen my best friend wedding three times i must admit i viewed it differently each time i've seen it . what i mean this i never really able decide which woman groom should end up ; his bride-to-be or his best friend . granted , julia every rotten thing she this film break up her best friend wedding so viewpoint i favored him ending up cameron . other hand one reviewer put it , julia her best friend more chemistry than groom his bride-to-be so viewpoint i also favored him ending up julia . during film , there times when i rooted julia get her man despite her despicable efforts win him over yet other times i wanted cameron end up groom . this movie still entertains me even after knowing outcome . aside simple plot breaking up wedding , this film good humor , good acting , decent soundtrack , overall believable chick flick most part . even guys like myself should find it entertaining i am normally picky when it comes chick flicks . special edition dvd worth picking up if you haven't seen features . one featurettes shows original alternative ending which much different how film originally ended . which two endings better ? only viewer decide . me , i'm not telling . anyway , bonus features overall good plentiful . only problem camera focus one featurettes somewhat off distorts picture bit . nothing too serious but very noticable . i suppose sequel this movie would interesting but then who knows how well it would turn out	1

this one my all time favourites ! paul verhoeven his best here ! this movie could easily turned out into smooth hollywood production , but verhoeven managed squeeze lot his dark sense humor somehow . this adding real extra dimension movie . movie situated possible future detroit where police privately owned (!) company called ocp . ocp now plan call halt crime : robocop project . all they now need " volunteer " . peter weller brilliantly cast robocop he basically talks like robot nature already . however kurtwood smith delivers best performance here . his role psychotic gangleader clarence boddicker really rocks ! go watch thisas this movie proves , action movies not necessarilyhave stupid .

i loved natural when it came out 1984 . mythical quality story , terrific acting perfect cast , great editing , great direction made this film one my all time favorite sports movies . so this year new dvd version released called director cut . apparently there 20 minutes new footage added , but editing results film only 6 minutes longer than original . chief difference two versions backstory relayed primarily through flashback " present " , roy hobbs returns his childhood home after 16 years away . he retrieves " wonder boy " , then goes new york start his career ny knights . new version works okay , but i frankly preferred original . i preferred its slightly more deliberate pacing , i don't think new scenes ( primarily extended versions already existing scenes ) added any real value or perspective . indeed , one scene which memo travels meet roy road actually detracted cohesion story . bottom line : if you loved original , you'll like this one . it still basically same film . i just don't think it needed any tinkering	1

wiktor grodecki brave filmmaker , one who unafraid address controversial subject , yet one who able make powerful sociologic statement creating metaphorical art film demands respect . grodecki interviews young boys ( ages 14 - 17 ) who male hustlers prague : he wisely removes ( most part ) interviewer questions allowing individual boys make spontaneous , searing comments . these young lads discuss why they became male prostitutes , how they deal selling their bodies , where they find their business ( train station , swimming pools , etc ) , how they feel johns their fellow hustlers , manner which they business including way which financial aspects come play - all way burns faces these young lads into our psyches . half way through this film grodecki introduces pavel rousek , man who day pathologist performing autopsies prague morgue his off hours ( using pseudonym hans miller ) creates , casts directs gay porno videos his home . rousek shown autopsy table gowning , gloving , grotesquely performing autopsy real cadaver while discussing both professions . there moments while he gloving he explains why he doesn't allow his boys wear condoms ( buyers his videos don't want see condoms ) , contrast his self protection vs enforcement prevention sexual protection his actors devastating . rousek miller then shown filming boys his home , explaining details achieving visual effects pornography : simultaneously we again hear boys views aspect their ' careers ' , creating pitiful tension . there almost no total nudity this film when it occur lighting so dark obscure it - making overall effect even more dense effectively tense . under all this lurid talk grodecki uses classical music - albinoni , mahler , mozart - which again provides contradiction makes topic digestible . final question grodecki poses his subjects involves boys perception ' soul ' while there variety responses , overall message these lads sell their bodies career , but soul ' what you think ' , something cannot taken you . several these boys screen presence faces , they noticed regular film makers , would probably give them legitimate careers . but power film comes words these boys , knowing completely their choice life , therein lies sorrow . this tough but very fine piece filmmaking . interestingly , grodecki absorbed this material used it create his subsequent feature film mandragora ( reviewed under title ) . this film more powerful two . not movie everyone , but certainly important document way life few know fewer understand . grady harp , september 05	1
umberto lenzis eaten alive my opinion way better than cannibal ferox . film so cheesy its hillarious . charectors , especially main male charector , funny watch . mane male charector slaps female role every 5 minutes so she calms down or so she dosnt give up their hiding place . worst thing film there 4 or 5 scenes different cannibal movies including lenzis man deep river . there also scenes lungle holocaust mountain cannibal god , i dont mean minor scenes , i mean big scenes , mostly gore scenes . scenes actually shot film some gory moments including decapitation , ear cut off cannibalization scene breast cut off . throw some brutal rape scenes topless me me lai you yourself pretty decent exploitation flick	1

all his other films , tarkovsky true author stalker . this film loosely based arkady boris strugatsky road side picnic , tarkovsky tried , he solaris ( 1972 ) , downplay science fiction aspect stalker . except brief explanation beginning film , tarkovsky chooses ignore speculations what could created zone , changes within it . he changed strugastsky brother characters events almost unrecognizably , he previously characters events lem solaris , he shifted philosophical implications story more pleasant direction . nevertheless , many original details novel remain . stalker definitely science fiction film , but its style unlike pulp high-tech films , such star wars trilogy ( 1977 - 1983 ) . it very demanding sometimes inaccessible viewing experience . this magnificent film almost not see light day . exteriors shot ( some three half months tallinn , estonia , beginning may 1977 , tarkovsky encountered number problems , starting some serious disagreements key members his crew , but mostly bad processing apparently out-of-date film stock . these events led serious financial problem , which somehow , almost miraculously , got resolved . eventually , june 1978 , second shooting tallinn took place , interiors shot moscow , premiere took place may , 1979 , total official disapproval . film met some recognition ussr , toward 1981 , following its success cannes festival 1980 , where it awarded prize ecumenical jury . stalker , tarkovsky marks shift toward his later style , long takes throughout film averaging one minute length , many which four minutes or longer . scene " telephone room " lasts almost seven minutes . these long scenes turn rely heavily talent actors sustain mood , like writer long monologue sand mogul room . even succession single shots , director wants give impression long take , such ride into zone flatbed car , which lasts three half minutes actually consists five shots . stalker , tarkovsky definitely more systematic his use black-and-white ( sepia ) color stocks than he his previous works . sickly black-and-sepia reserved polluted sterile reality world future , while color represents escape this world provided zone . swamp scene " stalker "' dream , tarkovsky reverts more usual convention , where dreams shown black-and-sepia-tones , reality color . however , last scene color , implying leakage powers zone into outside reality . always tarkovsky films , natural world present . water , which used source life , redemptive force center regeneration , now mostly symbol decay pollution . often , men wade through stagnant water , when clear water flows , it flows over rusting , decaying remnants props civilization : coins , weapons , religious images , hypodermic needles . only exception dream scene swamp , where water somewhat restored its positive , life-affirming symbols . last scene zone , men , resigned their limitations weakness , sit outside room rain falls inside , gently blocking them entering . wind , often associated spiritual aspects life , ominously rises when writer walks directly toward room , he told stop . earth positive force , upon arriving zone , " stalker "' first act lie down embrace it , swamp , all three men lie upon it . like miracle , there luxuriant , if dangerous , nature ever-present zone , contrast polluted outside world , where it totally absent . birds part this nature : call cuckoo bird heard numerous times zone . there also mysterious dog , which first appears swamp scene , when all three men lying down , becoming intimately close earth . up this point , men felt totally alienated their environment , outside inside zone , it very moment when they start meditate remember , dog appears : zone its territory . but end film , dog followed " stalker " outside zone , showing even there , hope men looking inside zone must somehow also exist here , outside , dog establishes its own space even though he becomes domesticated process . although tarkovsky usually favors classics such composers bach , pergolesi , or purcell , musical score stalker consists almost exclusively eduard artemiev electronic music mixed some folk melodies , contributing efficiently eerie atmosphere film . there also few distorted musical fragments wagner , ravel , beethoven . two tarkovsky favorite actors nikolia grinko anatoly solonitsyn . they appear five ( grinko ) four ( solonitsyn ) tarkovsky russian films , including stalker . their performances two lost souls search answer convincing . aleksandr kajdanovsky outstanding his role tormented somewhat pathetic " stalker " . although alisa frejndlikh appearance film restricted only few scenes , she powerful presence , especially her monologue end film . stalker , tarkovsky juxtaposes world decline , polluted sterile , verdant zone , which overtaken all human enterprises , shown remnants rusting cars tanks , dilapidated buildings , which taken over luxuriant vegetation . he portrays society which severed all links nature , its own past , , result , lost its spiritual moral bearings . stalker explores conflict science , rationalism , materialism , cynicism versus spirituality , faith , art , love . three men embody different philosophical principles . beginning film , professor justifies his going into zone pure scientific curiosity , probably also reassure himself room so-called " miracles " , if they ever happened , examined through scientific method explained logical , reasonable way . professor rational who tries understand world according law physics . however , when he arrives room , professor divulges his ulterior motive , which destroy it bomb he carrying all his knapsack . doing so , he would remove incentive people visit room irrational hopes , because " this place obviously won't bring anybody happiness . " blowing up room , professor stop gangsters , tyrants , megalomaniacs , all " self-appointed benefactors human race " misusing room power . but his main reason blow up room he not understand it . writer belongs those people who cannot accept world it . he well aware humanity decay his own well , but he abhors science , which he not understand , would rather look answers supernatural . writer believes redemptive power art , but he lost his inspiration . he would like believe potential room restore it , but because his cynicism self-loathing , he cannot sure . he lost faith himself his writing capacity help other people . besides , he hates writing , which him torture . " stalker " alone showing inclination toward faith , his comments regarding nature his prayer his companions " become helpless like children . " " stalker " knows zone , he total faith zone . he speaks it if it living . " stalker " simultaneously respects fears zone , he recognizes its potential provide comfort wretched ones who , like himself , lost all hope , but same time it punishes whoever transgresses its rules . this , course , how most religious people see their own gods . film contains many christian images biblical references , but it would mistake take them christian context : they stand general framework faith spirituality . redemptive power love personified " stalker "' wife . her love devotion final miracle which opposes cynicism emptiness modern world . all these ideas clearly expressed film end , she addresses audience her heartfelt monologue , while same time asking her husband remember love she feels him . three characters reach room , they ask their dearest wishes granted , but this would require painful searching self-examination , realization what they thought they wanted not exactly what they now really want . " you dream one thing but you get quite , " observes writer . film began question , " three men enter room ? " it ends , " why won't three men enter room ? " professor true aim destroy room , which beyond his scientific understanding . now he forced consider there may mystery his cartesian mind cannot account . he shows some humility acknowledges it not up him save humanity itself . writer said purpose his journey regain his genius , his inspiration . however , threshold room , he realizes he may not worthy accepting room gift . while he previously expressed his unworthiness , he now first time truly feels it . result their journey , both men changed -- some would say better -- although they not enter room , they nevertheless receive its gifts , something quite different than what they expected . " stalker " , however , asks nothing room because he stalker , stalkers not enter room . however , " stalker " faith zone , not need reassurances . he touch his " self , " aware his own wretchedness , his only purpose making trip guide faith hope those more wretched than he . musical fragments beethoven " ode joy , " last sequence , struggling heard over rumble passing train , imply society decay unsettled nature film resolution . this ending film typically tarkovskian , so far it open-ended , deliberately ambiguous , leaving viewer create his or her own meaning film .	1

this my first exposure penn teller wit , it wild - like sticking your head out car window into tornado . pennteller use humor , righteous outrage sarcasm attack some truly soft-headed people whose ideas continue pulsate national psyche . whether they 9/11 conspiracy nuts , people who see jesus their bathroom door or supposedly-scientific ghost trackers , pt go after them mercilessly called them out charlatans , frauds or fools . actually , they don't this exactly , since they'd trouble slander police . order demolish reputations those they dislike , they call them ( loudly ) * ssh*oles f*ck*rs . if this kind vituperative name-calling not your cup tea , least you warned . i like work pt . there far too many people making buck expense truth . whether you're peddling book claiming moon landing hoax , or selling tickets dallas , texas jfk conspiracy museum , or ( dalai lama ) trying get support re-establish priestly autocracy , you idiot or scammer deserve pt come after you hammer tong . some criticize pt using same techniques their targets use . i more bothered pt attacks humble people genuine faith . poor woman who sees jesus eyes her bathroom door may wrong , but least she doesn't appear profiting monetarily . that unlike woman who found image virgin mary her grilled cheese sandwich , who made few bucks when she sold sandwich casino . audrey santo family may faking " oils " drip statues their brain-damaged daughters ' room , but they living real family tragedy deserve some measure restraint . pt use these examples unfairly attack religion whole . they spout atheism if they want , but they could less abusive those genuine faith . who say god * doesn't * speak through sandwiches , bathroom doors tacos ? he limited whirlwinds burning bushes ? said , bs season 3 fun challenging . even when pt go over top , they provide plenty ponder	1

i can't add discussions repulsive evil represented this movie or its place american film history . but i two suggestions . first , buy longer version movie because these contain complete version . other versions shorter because they either contain much-edited version griffith re-released later years or artificially speeded up conform modern frame rates . second , read some background technical innovations film before watching it so you appreciate how this movie seminal movie american film history . you find some good background material online . you amazed griffith technical genius . but you also feel you need moral cleansing after watching his mocking , degrading , violent portrayal black human beings glorification kkk	1
why this movie so hard find dvd ? it one my absolute fav when i kid . i still find myself saying some cheeseball lines this flick . i love all different names coach gives henry , hey ravenbooser ! hey gardenhoser ! great stuff	1
i first saw this drive-in my family when it released ; it billed second double feature ( remember them ? ) tell you truth , my memory main attraction -- probably something disney , given my age -- escaped me years . i immediately loved this film , however , seen it many times since tv . i finally bit bullet bought it dvd when it turned up really cheap amazon . not unsurprisingly , technicolor print stunning ( it looks better than any print quiet man -- which won oscar its technicolor cinematography--i've ever seen ); surprisingly , so trailer , which comprises only extra . there french english mono tracks addition dolby digital track , optional english subtitles . cheesy menus only interactive menus few options , there no hard-copy insert ( immediate minus my book ) , hence my one-star demerit . it could worse -- least it anamorphic , its list price accurately reflects paramount budget treatmen t.t he film itself delightful ; it one john ford last , complete joy ( i especially got kick out his using dorothy lamour south seas role ... second time 26 years , first hurricane ) . i second previous reviewer , however , noting there seem some gaps continuity , especially end . jack warden elizabeth allen , least , still around time this released dvd -- might it not nice commentary ? this wasn't one ford major works , but i can't imagine most fans wouldn't like hear what it like work him , not mention lee marvin immortal duke . alas . romance male bonding island paradise--what not like ? " pappy " gave us helluva good romp days before political correctness ( i'm still wondering how " oriental " came pejorative ) that not without poignancy , if it doesn't make you want beg , borrow , or steal fare polynesia asap , i respectfully submit you're probably somehow deficient	1
this my favorite sam peckinpah film . i always loved it high schooler , i still . see dustin hoffman , calm , reserved intellecutal type turn into monster like he chilling enough . but you find you're actually cheering him end film . this film , clockwork orange ( released same year ! what year 1971 ! ) , really get into man darker nature , tell us some uncomfortable truths ourselves . we really root hoffman , even though he killing people , he enjoying it . even quiet , rural , " idyllic " english countryside , there still human garbage barbarism . you can't escape life , so speak . editing , direction , performances first rate , making this one peckinpah most daring films .	1

unlike probably most " john malkovich " fans , i actually saw later kaufman-jonze collaboration " adaptation " first . i thought , think , movie brilliant , but i little disappointed " john malkovich " first time i saw it . it very good , yes , but i hoping bit more , since most reviewers seem think it good or better than later film . well , yesterday i got through watching " john malkovich " third time , 2 years after i first saw it , it grown me quite bit . i still don't think it quite good " adaptation " , but it pretty close . " john malkovich " one those movies seems take place real world , except there bunch odd details aren't right . ex : puppeteering major artform ; everyone world total oddball ; there building 7 1/2 floor which contains portal into john malkovich brain . this movie so massively yet still so unobtrusively weird i'm sure it requires very specific taste fully get into it . you definitely need taste odd . story centers around craig schwartz , ( john cusack ) failed street-puppeteer who lives depression his strange but good-natured wife lotte ( cameron diaz ) their 100 or so pets . lotte suggests craig get job , real job , he so , becoming filing clerk small business 7 1/2 floor large office building . ( ceiling all 4 1/2 feet high , they emergency-stop elevator get floor . ) craig immediately smitten fellow 7 1/2 floor-dweller maxine ( catherine keener ) . maxine cruel cold-hearted individual , but craig can't help himself continues pursue her spite her utter contempt him . his efforts appear going nowhere until one day when he finds small door hidden behind filing cabinet . he crawls it discover this portal into john malkovich brain , where you watch what malkovich sees 15 minutes , after which you dumped ditch road then things really get weird , craig uses this portal way connect maxine , but lotte others get drawn malkovich finds out what going we learn real purpose portal . i don't want go , cause inexplicable , labyrinthine plot much appeal film . ( though it isn't just crazy crazy sake , actually comes together well . ) beyond this , kaufman tons clever , intelligent dialogue support wacky plo t.t his movie damn hard review , cause it so strange , yet much appeal humor character-driven . unbelievable , oddball characters all interesting , usually funny often endearing . cusack our main character sort straight man film . still , he not quite normal -- he , after all , want famous puppeteer . he typical " tortured artist " scruffy beard ponytail , but you can't help but like him . he just so hapless , john cusack always average man thing well . orson bean great dr. lester , craig boss 125 year old lech . ( craig says , " it pretty funny once you get past how disgusting it . ) catherine keener fantastic maxine , one most black-hearted characters i've ever seen . yeah , she doesn't physically hurt anyway , but her relentless verbal abuse unbelievable , she responds anything craig says her vicious , personal barb . finally , john malkovich wonderful himself ( sort ) , he hits great range notes isn't afraid make himself look bad . ( no one half brain would think this really anything who malkovich really , but lotsa people don't half brain ... ) though " john malkovich " comedy , it rather thoughtful ultimately very sad one . it touches themes isolation , desire someone else ultimate absurdity uncontrollability human life . this absurdity encapsulated central conflict , craig unrequited love maxine ; there no reason why he should love her , she , craig himself says , evil , but he can't help himself ; man capable reason , but emotion rules us emotion only sporadically makes sense . ( applying reason emotion never helps , not my experience , anyway . ) though i can't help but see kaufman primary author film , jonze deserves ton credit bringing vision fruition . making film this wacky seem real must damn near impossible , but jonze pulls it off aplomb spectacular technical proficiency . film moves near conventional scenes first-person perspective , dream sequences flat out surrealism . yet , all technique displayed film , it rarely seems extraneous . jonze doesn't seem showing off , flash all just necessary navigate inexplicable plot . score also fantastic , truly beautiful often-moving , it allows lot emotional impact film , particularly brilliantly conceived heartbreaking final scene . man , this review no good , but you can't justice movie this good this odd review . you'll just watch it . grade :	1
if you've never seen blob theatre , you're missing something ... color crisp photography great counterpoint steve mcqueen dedicated , earnest performance thankless role ,... remarkable effects . years , i mean years , no one knew how effects . it added charm film ... gelatinous mass creeps , rolls , wavers , oozes its way through effects scenes . well , numerous production photos included this criterion collection release finally explain technical innovation which brought blob life . photos alone worth half retail price . okay , okay , enough technical geek celebration . story unfolds pretty swiftly , landing meteorite , hapless old guy who pokes stick where it doesn't belong , doctor office ,.... despite campy subject , there some very serious scares this film , suspense hysteria grow thrilling climax . pop popcorn , dim lights , get ready opening featuring hilarious theme song , early work burt bacharach . what blob outer space ? who knows ... but b-l-o-b spells fun . enjoy	1

so it falls me review this first ? this june 1977 concert london rainbow theater captures recently reconfigured wailers ending european tour promote masterful ' exodus ' album . rare videotaped performances ' trenchtown rock ' ' rebel music ' , ' crazy baldhead ' , dating earlier wailers repertoire , performed wonderfully well here , treasures this collection , however . missed notes some songs , including beginning ' exodus ' , guitarist junior marvin failure notice his boss bob start singing ' lively up yourself ' , minor annoyances , loss aston barrett famous distinctive bass line ' no more trouble ' , jettisoned favor ' new ' , harder sound ( surely reaction exciting energy london ' new wave ' summer 1977 ) . way , it always annoyed me front cover picture vhs now dvd editions most definitely not this 1977 show , but rather same photo graces 1975 live lyceum album . i wish those responsible would show some responsibility well some historical accuracy . dvd sound picture good , considering age videotape source . now if they would only release 1980 dortmund , germany performance dvd . accompanying dvd ' carribbean nights ' informative enjoyable , provides good look marley life times . while it contains no full-length performances , it contain several exciting if brief film clips various performances such leeds , uk 1973 show peter tosh . hopefully these early performances someday make it onto dvd well .	1
una historia veridica llevada al cine magistralmente . todos los actores realizan unas actuaciones tan maravillosas que en realidad uno cree estar viviendo en el 1848 ... imanol arias ( ladislao gutierrez ) transmite tanta pasion , amor deseos prohibidos que es comprensible el por que camila , sacrifica todo por el . aparte de ser un actor increiblemente guapo , se adentra tanto en su personaje , que te hace llorar , amar , rezar sufrir con el . mi escena favorita es cuando camila le confiesa su amor le dice que se esta muriendo de amor , el le dice que eso es natural su edad , como queriendo ignorar que es de el que ella esta hablando . su amor ya en ese momento es mutuo el enferma de amor . lucha entre su amor por dios su amor por ella . definitivamente una pelicula que merece la pena ver , maravillosamente actuada , con unos efectos de luces tenuesque le dan un toque de romanticismo , una musica fabulosa , unos dialogos en susurros entre los enamorados llenos de pasion , la lucha carnal entre el amor humano el amor dios yun tragico final . mi pelicula favorita se la recomiendo todos ...	1
when i saw this dvd video store , i knew i would rent it , i thing mountains , despite feeling it would not very good movie . well , my expectations met . movie , although mildly enjoyable times its mountain views , pretty much stinker . it definitely not keeper . plot simple . scientific data indicates particular mountain urals eastern europe going undergo massive avalanche bring down half snow mountain onto ski resort . course , person who brings this information village mayor met derision . no one wants believe her . like john baptist , she voice crying alone wilderness . meanwhile , two mountain bad boys , brothers who run snowmobile tours mountains , their own troubles . younger one bad break-up resort owner daughter . other one his hands full keeping his wilder , younger brother check . resort owner daughter her own issues , her father his business partner . when inevitable happens disaster strikes , let games begin . over all , special effects repetitive , which expected , given fact this obviously low budget film . plot loosey-goosey , number silly sub-plots nowhere , script just plain bad . directing laughable ham-handed . acting , most part , dreadful , exception resort owner , who gives evidence some acting ability . no one this film should give up their day job just yet . bottom line viewers should take pass this film , unless , like me , you sucker mountains or disaster films . even then , viewers should proceed their own risk .	-1

starting 1960 success american international pictures release " fall house usher " , producer/director roger corman began highly successful collaboration legendary hollywood actor vincent price adapting number edgar allan poe short stories into very atmospheric horror films glowing rich technicolour . they really reached their creative peak their second teaming classic story " pit pendulum " , which my favourite all efforts they worked together . roger corman long known low budget " " , movies specialist here outdone himself incredibly lavish looking production while little relation original poe story manages weave fascinatingly eerie tale helped one vincent prices ' best performances this genre . " pit pendulum " , apart employing macabre torture device title its gripping conclusion also boasts magnificently eerie sets , great period detail beautiful tones colour sure warm heart any classic horror movie lover . story opens , ( unusually poe story ) , 16th century spain where we see young francis barnard ( john kerr ) , travelling up sinister seaside castle his brother-in-law don nicholas medina ( vincent price ) . coming all way england however this not just social call he seeking answers sudden death his sister elizabeth ( barbara steele ) , who nicholas ' wife . nicholas however most complex character himself attempts brush aside any discussion regarding elizabeth demise putting down simply some problem her blood . he secretly tormented memory his sadistic father sebastian medina ( also vincent price flashbacks ) , who member spanish inquisition set up his own private torture chamber basement castle . sebastian also responsible burying alive his unfaithful wife before his young son eyes . his tormented state nichiolas also fears he may responsible burying elizabeth alive well very soon strange noises heard castle including sound someone playing harpsichord only elizabeth could play . all these strange occurences seem indicate nicholas right guessing elizabeth come back dead torment him his crime . nicholas counselled supposedly sympathetic family doctor charles leon ( anthony carbone ) , elizabeth could not alive what he hearing his mind while francis who still trying uncover exactly what happened his sister begins suspect doctor gets impression he anxious him his way before anything discovered . however matters take turn worst when nicholas ' mind finally breaks when elizabeth previously locked room ransacked he takes persona his demented father believing he still back time inquisition . when elizabeth actually seems " rise dead " , however she her " accomplise " , plans goes badly wrong dealing sadistic " sebastian " , rather than mentally destroyed " nicholas " , planned both meet grisly ends deep pit cellar imprisonment deadly iron maiden torture devise . francis also runs into trouble reborn sebastian who now views him enemy removed francis finds himself thrilling climax strapped table below rapidly decending swinging pendulum sharp cutting blade . it only quick thinking nicholas ' sister catherine ( luana anders ) , he rescued tortured nicholas meets his own grisly end falling into castle pit . rarely any corman /vincent price collaborations lavish " pit pendulum " . wonderful visuals nicholas ' sinister castle literally howering mist shrouded cliff opening scenes tremendously atmospheric castle interiors thickly laden opulent furniture , mysterious sliding panels cobweb filled torture chamber all manner fiendish devices , this film special treat horror movie lover . vincent price course centre all attention here his colourful roles both tormented nicholas medina flashbacks , his evil father sebastian he brings his usual polished performing skills dual roles making " pit pendulum " , one his most memorable films 1960 . john kerr still best remembered his performance broadway film version " tea sympathy " , surprisingly makes fairly colourless young male lead here really doesn't appear much his character making it one weakness acting ensemble present . barbara steele , mysteriously dubbed here some reason , antony carbone villians piece wonderful their roles carbone especially really excels " caring " , doctor who not all he first seems . period film roger corman gone all out visuals " pit pendulum " , rich colour authentic 16th century costumes really capturing flavour time . creepy atmosphere further enhanced thunder storms lightening course almost essential element most horror tales but which here become almost character themselves raging storms seem build momentum ferosity nicholas ' state mind slowly crumbles . vincent price really complete rebirth demand actor horror films result his hugely popular efforts these roger corman horror films american international . he always brings integrity style his characters no matter how over top proceedings taking place stories . sight deranged vincent price gleefully hovering over john kerr tied down beneath swinging pendulum probably one most famous horror images 1960 this startling climax story helps make " pit pendulum " , essential part any horror lovers film library . highly recommended .	1
not just disaster : total turkey ages ! every misstep director make while tackling artist bio-pic made here holland .

what heck taking this series so damn long reach dvd nice box set , it one most treasured series among " gi joe/transformers/thundercats " generations , yet amazingly well , well written , well animated , it , there never toy line , or serious merchandising there could`ve ( even adult , i`d still love set dd action figures main characters ) ... but there dvds every other cartoon series this generation except this one ( well amazingly well " legend prince valiant " , which also deserves box set dvds ... easily ... ) simply inexcusable ...!!!! what shocks me actually , producer this series marvel entertainment , who well known whore-out just everything every little penny they get , so it actually comes quite bit shock indeed ... what they waiting ? haven`t they seen popularity every other dvd set so far best saturday morning shows sales no-brainer look sales " battle planets , land lost , gi joe , thundercats , transformers , etc etc etc ... ) . c`mon guys , wake up smell money .... i`ll first line ... i saw actual boxed set record store other day " complete series " , but it made " outside usa dvd players " ... it looked like professional release , not cheap bootleg , so i really pissed ... i want box set good `ol usa ... anybody else any thoughts	1

ah , those bygone days when british studios like ealing shepperton churned out little classics like this regular basis . stalwarts era all here , including wilfred hyde-white , bernard cribbins , course , sellers . those who know sellers his later , american period find this character little unusual ; he more sharp tough guy who runs operation than he bumbling fool he later perfected . plot simple ; sellers co . want break out prison , commit heist , then break back into prison so they perfect alibi . it all sounds quite masterful but , course , things go terribly awry . fans sellers and/or golden era british comedy , this definitely one check out	1
this excellent portrayal play . i can't think anyone who could've made better cyrano than jose ferrer . i haven't seen later version gerard depardieu , but heard it good . there just something old black white movies . perhaps best part movie swordplay actually authentic ! not lot crappy gratuitous blade-twirling like you see today movies . you'd hard-pressed see better rapier dagger any movie . all all , excellent show	1
like other reviewers , i think sequel better than original . one only hopes 3rd installment issued even better footage than first two , especially if more 35mm films found . color adds lot drama presentation , mixing horror war death camps pompous nazi celebrations . seeing these period films , it hard believe nazis members human race . nowadays , top college football players drafted national football league take test basic intelligence , wonderlic test . score 30 , out possible 50 , considered good score . hitler other top nazis would lucky score 10 this test , because they simply couldn't count . what else could possibly explain attacking russia declaring war america ? same time , leaving great britain unconquered , available later western front . nazis outnumbered no chance win , long run . all their self-proclaimed superiority , these guys simply not smart . thing strikes me , especially seeing atomic bombs exploding over japan , how incredibly lucky germans . hitler launched his last western counteroffensive december , 1944 . this " battle bulge , " american terms . if he succeeded , world war ii could stretched out 3 months or more . if happened , atomic bombs may probably would used nazi germany . thank heaven didn't happen but it could . excellent dvd like this one should make us all appreciate what we today , despite current happenings middle east elsewhere . there lot kindness decency seen around us , things short supply 60-70 years ago . 1940-45 , world stood brink total destruction we found way out . let hope believe good triumph over evil again	1
okay , i admit it ; linda abba schmuck . after 30 years , they still getting massive airplay all over world , lot people who would never admitted they into this group years ago now acknowledging what we collectively always knew : most everyone loves abba , except some us never admit it . that okay , though , because i went through my later teens up until my late 30 . all you closet fans out there , this dvd great purchase , because you finally realize it not these four incredibly talented people fault they chemistry public reacted . even their manager stig andersson , who propelled them fame , doesn't know why they took off way they . let me ask all you naysayers all-important question : if this group so disposable , how it their music still so popular after 3 decades , they not only enjoyed revival , but music made great stage production ? it true : benny andersson bjorn ulveus very good songwriters their sesibilities them all times . agnetha faltskog anni-frid lyngstad , their former wives partners , beautiful vocalists together , what they them something very special while it lasted . also , they never reunion since their breakup 1982 , they don't intend . heartless hit machine rep they've suffered not only joke , but this dvd show you just how human talented they really . one thing i struck this particular dvd how warm , intelligent , humble bjorn ulveus , how much more likable full life frida , rather than pretty blond pinup girl agnetha , actually . this dvd full lots surprises naysayers lots treats those us who knew these swedes talented , personable beings who simply disliked touring all reasons anyone who never toured could understand . interviews fun , footage priceless , music rich melodious . most all , you pull this dvd out your player smile your face realize you never dress like you any time group together again ! this 90 minutes pure , poppy fun .	1
what fast turning out one biggest years ever cinematic retreads ( doesn`t anybody out hollywood any new ideas anymore ? ) , " longest yard " second remake robert aldrich film hit theaters past six months . first , " flight phoenix , " released last december . now all we ask , " new improved " version " whatever happened baby jane ?, " starring jane fonda sissy spacek , far behind ?. this new edition `70`s hit , adam sandler plays paul crewe , ex-quarterback pittsburgh steelers who banished league six years earlier allegedly shaving points off game . when he arrested stealing his girlfriend car , crewe sent texas prison run diabolical warden his cadre sadistic guards . warden , football fan way back , enlists crewe expertise putting together team convicts take guards " friendly little game " intramural football . caveat this ragtag team must good enough make decent show things but not good enough beat their opponent or there hell pay . thus , game becomes inverted , high stakes encounter pitting forces good ( prisoners ) against forces evil ( penal authorities ) . thirty years elapsed since i saw original version this film , so i don't feel particularly qualified evaluate how this new one stacks up against old . i say , however , this " yard " faces some serious problems get-go casting sandler lead role . burt reynolds , who played protagonist original film who gets fairly good-sized role this one well , least credible man who might professional football player . but adam sandler !? come think it , sandler probably more believable nfl legend than he hot underwear spokes-model , absurdity we also asked swallow - but less said better . there isn't much recommend this latest edition " longest yard . " plotting predictable , characters mere two-dimensional stereotypes humor obvious lowbrow . final showdown - i.e. big game - goes so long most tension inherent material simply drains away long before closing credits . perhaps saddest aspect this movie watching cloris leachman making complete utter fool herself playing grotesque , beehive-coiffured sex maniac obsessed seducing young mr. crewe . some sights we should just not asked face this lifetime .	-1
let me start stating i read tab pretty well , i've studying excellent instructor year , i'm real bug getting stuff i play sound ' right ' . right , i mean it needs least same feel close phrasing - doesn't mechanically note note . but , sometimes , capture feel multitrack recording single guitar you make allowances exactness . still , it sound right , sound good . secondly , this deserves more than 5 stars . i've got several different tab sources hendrix , dvd ( excellent ) instructor , working couple jimi tunes . thought i least scaled-back versions down pretty good . i've watched most this set once-through now , it left my jaw floor . richness detail blew me a-way . time you're through 2nd or 3rd song set , you'll glad they chopped them up into measure gave you half-speed demos so you wouldn't miss any detail . even rhythm parts need slowed down so you see what going . not tab - heck , go get it . then you'll best both worlds ( but this world better , trust me ! ) . i grew up hendrix music ; i know stuff my head , almost heart . but theory explanations velvert turner combined dead-on normal half-speed split-screen demos andy goldmine what they reveal . how music phrased huge part sound , you're not going get just tab . seeing it performed here , close-up fretwork split inset screen picking strumming gives you . that hard find , heaven knows why anyone would knock i t.t he delivery set feels choppy times because breaking songs down few measures time . but sonic landscape jimi work so rich thick i don't see how else they could it still keep our heads exploding ! bear mind many tab sources you're going get essentially going " easy guitar " version these songs , not real deal details full half-speed demos digestible pieces . getting it concert - fuggedaboudit ! besides period quality problems most hendrix footage , you realize there problems directorial idea what makes good entertainment . usually conflicts what makes good instructional source . comparison , go rent srv live el macambo see how much you glean how play stevie , even though it capture much better technology much more recently . or , get " lightning bottle " see if you figure out much masterful acoustic version " can't satisfied " buddy guy plays . concert footage not shot teach you how play , there no freakin ' way this should dismissed favor old concert footage training aid . you'd need your head examined if you . i'd strongly recommend dvd version this set so you go directly your favorite section . also , some dvd players let you step through varying speeds loop given segment over over . trust me - some those jimi solos you're going want those extra tech tools handy ! i simply am amazed anyone panned this set . it gem source material anyone truly wants play hendrix so it should like it should . can't imagine what they expecting so dissappointed it . so far i know there isn't anything else out there like it . if there - axis or ladyland - i want it	1

kaufman adaptation michael crichton japan-bashing potboiler realtively light approach , simple buddy-cop movie featuring pair entertaining star performances . spite fact novel alarmism dangers dominant japan would soon undercovered mellow script confers much more importance opposite views eastern western worlds around lot issues , director muted xenophobic material made book so terrific brutal , transforming it into interesting film , whose plot nourished great visual effects stunning differences both cultures , sean connery working out common link two ways life great doses suggested violence alarming use technology create unexpeceted accusations . yet sean connery makes very credible performance , detective , script seems uncapable surmount anecdothic character good guys bad guys , ominous presence japanese mob pretensions noir film , picture leaves us bitter taste , because even if there good sequences , whole material promised best best major intentions .	1
not watch this garbage ! this worst movie i ever seen . i'm honestly upset other reviewers here misleading me so badly . this film so bad , so many problems i don't know where even begin . i only hope someone verge watching this changes their mind after reading this review . if i saved one person buying/watching this disaster , then i my job . very least buy it used bin , that where mine	-1
first , i not rate this poorly comparing it original . i looked this its own movie not think it remake . also , unlike many reviewers , i no problem fact humans talked yet still oppressed not fighting back . majority humans history our planet oppressed afraid fight back . american culture freedom not historical norm . said , i not thrilled overall plot movie , nor quality acting , though special effects pretty good , imho . theme , however , struck me most rememorable this movie , caused me drop otherwise 3 1 ( or less ) , one which deeply rooted beliefs apes held so easily stripped away . our " hero " encourages friendly girl ape come him see something amasing change her world ( forgive my not remembering their names ) , it portrayed manner what he doing good noble something we should all grateful , even though what he showing her intended bring all her previously held beliefs crashing down . then there second-in-command ape who very devoted their ape religion , yet moment he enters spaceship , he instantly comes believe everything he previously held sacred lie - just like . i couldn't help feel if movie trying say audience , " hey , haven't you heard guy darwin ? yeah ? then why you still believe silly god person yours ? " this movie , i believe try touch issue day , secularism verus religion . movie , it seems , coming down heavily side secularism	-1

i still don't understand love crash , recent film centering racism issue . it seemed like film couple good ideas but they featured bad movie which makes its win best picture all more confusing . film some reason reminded me traffic which centers important issue ; this one drug war its effects addicts non-addicts . while you obviously tell traffic important film it indeed good one , it also slightly marred erratic pacing bit uninteresting characters . film , unlike let say , magnolia or short cuts , 3 separate storylines one thing common : drug trade . one story set ohio , robert wakefield newly-appointed " drug czar " crusading against decreasing amount drugs country . however , he daughter that quickly starting get addicted . san diego , helena sees her husband arrested while she unaware he key player drug trade captured dea agents who going testify . finally mexico , highway patrol cop gets involved corruption drug cartels want control drugs going out mexico us . help audience differentiate different places , color code given each segment . wakefield story looks so unbelievably blue you wouldn't surprised if character blood looked blue too . san diego looks more traditional but bit overexposed making it more brighter while mexico looks like indie movie very gritty raw feel jittery looking camera . it helps keep track where you but like i said , you've never seen skin tones look so blue before ; they really overdid it some cases . best storyline most likely mexico since it anchored benicio del toro who certainly deserved his oscar . it also got more interesting story better look it despite its intentional amateurishness . one isn't great probably wakefield story since it never gripped me all much . san diego alright but nothing special . ultimately problem film film just felt slow . ever watch one those movies where it feels like you've watching longer than movie ? not mention sometimes one storyline starting get interesting then whoosh ! off somewhere else . similar problem plagued babel since chieko story ultimately more emotional gripping than others . some probably disagree say all stories traffic good but i always groaned slightly when we moved away mexico . it certainly ambitious film so not going argue there it great film times but i wouldn't say it my favorite film 2000	1
i've skiing now nearly 10 years during this time i've many ski instructors different styles teaching but nothing compares information prodived this dvd . lito goes straight point tells you exactly what you need know early weight shift correct body position various runs easy blues serious off piste . within day or two practicing his techniques i found myself carving more arcs more control my skis . which face it , real reason we all wanted ski first place . not only am i more control but once i feel like i am progressing out intermediate rut . this dvd gives lots freeze frames easy understand instruction which you practice minute you hit slopes . i found dvd so useful i ended up buying his book well which gives you even more insight into different techniques small radius arcs mogul runs . thus i go ski holiday which i've just returned boy this book complement dvd . i'm more visual learner myself reckoned book wouldn't add any more additional information but i safely say i wrong . total running time this dvd just under 60 mins he repeat himself alot but this just proves concrete how important some core aspects his ski technique . anyway i highly recommend this dvd believe me you won't dissappointed	1
this film unlike any documentary i've ever seen before . it combines various cinematic styles -- albert maysles ' uncut , " direct cinema " approach , michael moore " guerilla documentary " approach . characters all nuanced , complex personalities , filmmakers startingly good job not passing judgment allowing us see characters who they really . rather than simplistic anti-bush doc , film meditation how media , money , politics combine reak havoc life already troubled man . i highly , highly recommend this film , not only those who interested intersection media , money , politics , but those who interested experiencing great filmmaking	1

if you like comic antics ben stiller jack black , you'll find this winning combination . when friendship neighbors co-workers tested after one them becomes very wealthy , hilarity begins . invention leads black wealth bit silly , but inventive . my opinion , this very enjoyable comedy lots laughs . chrissy . mcvay - autho	1
some interesting dialogue sprinkled within mostly nonsensical , dull , slow plot . also , whole thing swedish hard read english subtitles . blah . film critics love this one because it gives them bizarre , convoluted material upon which ponder self-importantly . it really not worth pondering , though .	-1
it difficult review this film without including spoilers . best see it yourself . acting , one would expect , super . it " sleuth " " rope " school but better than either my opinion .	1
