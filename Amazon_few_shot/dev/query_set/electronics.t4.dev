i ordered this television high hopes , knowing despite reports firmware problems other defects i would luck out save bundle . but you get what you pay . every sharp aquos lcd tv manufactured before april 1 , 2006 shipped bad firmware . what this mean you ? me , it meant 15 minutes after unpacking tv turning it , it turned itself off never turned back again . resets , system resets , power cycling , unplugging components didn't help . my tv completely bricked . search turned up threads websites like avs forum other owners sharp tvs d4u d6u series all reporting similar power management problems almost immediately after purchase . them , fix visit sharp authorized service center either firmware replaced or physical replacement boards inside tv . i say " visit " because sharp not cover in-house technician visits tvs under 32 " , fact they could informed me before letting me wait 1 week tech visit would ultimately canceled . so here i am , 10 days later hundreds dollars poorer no tv show it . instead , it sits authorized service center ( because sharp obviously not vet its service centers make sure you get good service them either ) . i'm willing bet all inventory d6us tigerdirect selling fire sale prices produced before 4/1/2006 . check serial number your tv if you order one . if it begins 501-512 , 601 , 602 or 603 , immediately demand firmware upgrade sharp ( 1-800-be-sharp ) , regardless whether or not you're experiencing these issues ; you eventually , hopefully while sharp warranty still effect you .	-1

i bought this alarm clock today ( april 7 , 2007 ) bed , bath beyond $10 . i wish i seen reviews first . i bought it because product name , small size variety options . unfortunately , i realized it wasn't great buy when i brought it home ... spent few hours trying keep battery certain position so clock would stay . connections appear very sensitive battery doesn't stay place . clock light pointless . it supposed help you see time dark , but unless you clock certain angle everything appear blurry . actually , screen blurry most positions even light off . alarm , it pretty quiet . if you're sound sleeper or live noisy environment , this not clock you . you'll only hear alarm if you sleep it under your ear . final note this product : clock almost hour without any problems ... but only battery cover slightly open . if i close cover all way , clock shuts off . if you want alarm clock last awhile , i suggest buying something else . you get less than you pay this model .	-1

this keyboard folds out well i liked feel keys . however , ir connector needs direct connection ir port pda . ipaq , this port bottom handheld . 210 degree arm not rotate this area . order proper connectivity , you turn handheld its side . this then requires software program download ( not freeware i find ) rotate your screen landscape view , unless you read sideways without getting headache . before buying this product , check your handheld see if your ir port 4-8 o'clock - if so , this may difficult keyboard use	-1

if you want budget home theater system under $200 there probably not many systems better then sony ht-ddw700 . this system ideal small rooms such bed room or tiny living room . considering price , sound quality actually better then expected me . tiny cube speakers presents pretty good clarity . they may look like cheap computer speakers but they aren't bit heavier then they look . center channel may little underpowered since dialog during dvd movies sound tad soft little too low . surround effects during movies dolby digital dts very good though . if set up properly speakers handle surround effects very well . some minor complaints speaker wire attached speakers very thin . they fixed can't replaced . also , if you want heart stopping bass then this system might not you . 8 " subwoofer okay considering price system . it currently better then any other sub included home theater system under $200 . it isn't powered , very light ( only 9 lbs ) you pretty close actually feel bass . volume would cranked up extremely high sub actually rattle your walls . receiver comes 1 optical 1 coxial digital input 4 rca analog inputs . it should enough most cases . extra digtal input or two wouldn't hurt but again system under $200 . setup couldn't easier . you just hook up included microphone , place it your listening postion press button remote . system automatically sets up speaker distance , delay volume levels . receiver comes basic pro logic ii music move modes upmix your stereo sources . it also other sound fields effects enhace sound but they don't really seem enhance sound much if all . basically , if you want home theater system small room under $200 then there isn't much better then sony ht-ddw70	1

after doing fair amount internet research mp3 players their features i under impression i would go ipod . computer industry almost 15 years i never fond mac always little biased towards pc . this added my reticence own mac product growing complaints service ipod ' bit ' over priced i forged . i started reading through all reviews i could find internet always , found wealth them here amazon . my dismay all reviews i could find product names i knew absolutely trashed products they reviewing which scared me immensely . thats , until i got iaudio line . reviews almost all positive complaints present things i could easily overlook . i love control , i am big guy big hands i rarely , if ever , pushed control not result i intending . i my iaudio x5 over month i nothing bad say least . i am avid linux user it works flawlessly linux , sound quality phenomenal , except ear buds came mine lot static them so get rid those . fm tuner great ( you wont get ipod ) . i travel lot i pipe my x5 through my car stereo using cassette tape converter plugged into stereo out port . what else i say , this great product great features it looks good too ! i also bought case zcover which fits purpose but i think time goes some better more versatile cases come market . satisfied custome	1

i researched tvs long time before i ended up buying this set . it helped costco offered coupon $300 off price ($1000 final price ) . i thought i may not like tv , so i decided buy person opposed online help potential return . however , there no way i am returning this tv ; it awesome . picture great , just sd . strech feature makes regular 4:3 picture fit screen not look distored . i worried buying 37 " tv then watch black bars sides avoid distortion . but there no need this tv since sharp figured out how strech picture without distortion . dvds look incredible this tv well . what even better built-in hd tuner . i debating upgrading my cable hd package , but i decide spend $13 " rabbit ears " target . oh my , once i plugged indoor antenna let tv track digital stations i amazed . analog station popped up like fierce snowstorm winter , but when i went up hd digital companion station , i couldn't believe my eyes . incredible hd picture rabbit ears set my desk ... indoors no less ! why would i upgrade my cable tv hd package when they can't offer local stations hd ? especially when they free simple antenna ! i told this possible , but quite frankly i skeptical . not anymore , i am so glad i got sharp built-in tuner . i seriously considered just buying hd ready tv monitor upgrade through my cable provider . boy am i glad i didn't . if you market very nice tv easy use provides great picture , i would highly recommend this set .	1

edge 305 provides wealth knowledge , easy install , well use . i would love given it 5 stars ( it deserves them ) , but one thing not work correctly , really bugs me calories expended . it couldn't more inaccurate if they tried make it way . first day i installed it , i took it quick 1 mile test ride . it indicated mile i burned 100+ calories . wish it true , but it not . unfortunetly next day i going take it out 100 mile ride , but crashed i started out not riden since ( 3 days ) . i wore chest strap office today test calories burned further . after 2 hours it read 0 burned . i just took it car ride 7 miles . those 7 miles driven car , it indicates i burned nearly 600 calories , again i wish , but no way . other than flaw , whioh i hope they fix software update , i highly recommend this product , it all other ways it great	1

so this controller looked pretty sweet me so i bought it over rumble pad . i liked idea fans wicking away sweat , i tend get pretty white knuckled my controllers . i bought this controller specifically star wars battlefront 2 pc , it works like dream . i also like x-box controller layout ( offset anolog sticks more ergonomic ) than ps2 style controller logitech rumble pad . it also better grips than ps2 controller . only things i think bad it following : 1 . it not modeled large xbox controller , but rather regular one , which ok most people , but i big hands i get bit cramped up if i play way too long . 2 . i slightly dissapointed lack custimization software available this pad . i saitek cyborg evo joystick you create custom profiles every game you want use it then set profile before launching game . this isn't issue battlefront 2 since it very excellent game control configurator , but i could see where if game didn't good interface ( or maybe older games ) this pad could suffer this regard . 3 . this isn't so much issue me , but i would assume lot game play turning off fan , fan motor likely die sooner than pad wear out . i don't care too much , because fan more novelty me than anything . i still use it even if it die . overall , great controller , i actually would give it 4.5 rating , but isn't option here	1

when i first got wireless network home i purchased kensington wifi finder . it worked fine . but time went i saw these smaller versions come out chrysalis development . i heard they more powerful more versatile . so i bought one . i not disappointed . since it same size my keyless entry remote my car , it fit perfectly my keychain . also it much longer range than others . but best all , it directional . meaning i simply turn my body while holding down button leds change instantly signal strength increases or decreases . what great product . i love it !	1
i purchased this gps back april 2006 very happy it since . it not perfect , but you remember this not dedicated street navigator or hicker gps , it hybrid two there compromises . car : it accurate maps routes quickly 90% time . other 10% time it either looses signal , outdated maps ( my update ordered it way i type ) , or just slow processing some reason . this 10% time i'd say only 2% time this actual problem me . rest time i able simply guess what i needed next or it didn't matter all . i not found perfect way fixing slow route calcuations , but vast majority time this hasn't issue . foot : one features sold me this fact it long lasting battery it waterproof . both qualities needed used hiking . only catch you turn off lock roads , otherwise you get some really confusing directions ! also it difficult program destinations coordinates opposed addresses , but it ( put address then change everything including coordinates confirmation screen before hitting route ! ) . boat : haven't tested this i don't boat , haven't purchased water based maps . overall i'm very happy this looking forward map update . i wish it little faster route calculating map drawing , it easier imput exact coordinate points . it still better than buying/lugging around 2 seperate gps systems me	1

i've held off reviewing this item until i actually got some alerts - i got plenty them over weekend , so here it .... there seem lot complaints this hard set-up - so many , after no problems setting it up myself , i'd worried i'd something wrong . over weekend , number thunderstorms tornados rolled thorough my area - using s.a.m.e alert system my county - i received notification each warning . i purchased this radio specifically s.a.m.e alert system , living central mississippi , we get tornado warnings all spring - i didn't want 2am alarm tornado 3 counties north me . my one beef unit radio reception - even included external antenna , it spotty - especially weather radio reception . i'm not sure how far i am nearest weather radio transmitter , but living suburbs madison , i can't too far . if you're rural area , i'd definitely look into getting external antenna ( it port better external antenna than telescoping antenna included )	1

although i prefer akg k701 most my listening , this competing entry beyer so close it almost coin toss . ( one recent comparison headphone artcle came up dead heat . ) this surprising , considering dt880 one most reasonably priced major mid-priced headphones . bass full but nicely textured - not touch bass bloat found here . highs detaied never seemed sharp me , overall sound offers huge soundstage . instead music top your , these beyers lend perceived distance few feet ; ths makes classical music sound doubly elegant , surprisingly makes rock music grandiose appealing kind way . these headphones don't require headphone amp , but certainly profit one . 30 ohm version makes more volume , though 250 ohm version standard , best most daily listening . dt880 sounds great , but lacks tad k701 high-end sparkle . conversely , beyer value , comfort , workmanship can't help but impress . this phone labored under shadow akgs senn 650s , but listeners always impressed dt880s sound . it may your best value mid-priced , all-purpose headphone	1

when i started looking mp3 player my main concern ability play songs very high quality level . ipod consideration , top rated sony mp3 player . however , i didn't want get what everyone else after bad experience unnamed sony game console , i thought i would try something new . if you asked ten people who cowon , i would say probably nine ten couldn't tell you . it very sturdy same general shape/dimensions ipod . clearly designed compete apple , iaudio x5 some very valuable aspects : -superb sound quality , especially something weighs under 8 oz . ( i am currently using full size stereo headphones because they more comfortable)-rugged all metal construction overall great feel-simple design intuitive joystick/buttons ( i found joystick quite easy use after 10 minutes ; converts ipod may take some getting used to)-a plethera options : mach3 bass , surround sound , pan , wallpaper , 5 band equalizer , fm radio , voice recorder , surround sound mp enhance-the ability play video-a 14 hour battery 3 hour charge time-very powerful , i normally listen level 20 or less 40 volume levels it-priced same equal or lesser mp3 players-extremely easy program use transferring any type file iaudio . it drag drop system ; it took me seven minutes transfer all my 3.5 gigs music . -everything you need included box - earphones , usb 2.0 transfer cable , cable , 4 port attachment bottom player , charger jetshell software-great storage space ( 20 gb ) which used store much more than mp3s there some negative attributes iaudio x5 however : -the most glaring problem i in-ear headphones ; they not fit all way more than uncomfortable . they also assymetrical length cord . i consider myself average size ear canals so i imagine this major problem other users . i suggest cowon completely redesigns these . -because brand widely unknown , price may scare some away even all features reviews . -no place online buy mp3s particulary this player ( however i read somewhere there would soon one just like itunes . ) this my first mp3 player i am extremely happy purchase even price , because i would rather pay more quality . iaudio x5 all around outstanding media player i believe start make name itself once word gets out . if i rate everything came box i would give it 9.5 out 10 because earphones . other than this mp3 player close perfect .	1

well , i ended up buying mine closeout radio shack $149 .. i love mine ... sound really great , price awesome ! i use mine dvd , my tv regular sound all tv i watch , also tuner listen radio/ cd surround sound . some buyers talked whine speakers ... i don't know if this helps or not , but i share- i extra wire bundled up speakers i not put all wire anywhere near speakers or head unit . i thought bundle wire near speaker might cause interference , so if you whine , make sure extra wire not near equipment . mine not make any noise standby , or skip all either . i am very happy mine .	1

okay , this not review product itself . but , i stronglyencourage you consider not getting n.e.w warranty . they arereally not business fix things but make money not fixing things . if you anything device not working ( e.g. you dropped it , forget it they aint gonna fix/replace it whatever . ) they very sparce network repair companies so if there no one who fix it your area you ship it them virginia(of course you pay shipping ! )lastly , they tend screw over their repair companies so some cases they refuse repair items covered under n.e.w warranty or they take forever repair it since they know n.e.w take months pay them work they . if you want nightmare warranty then all means go it	-1

i real excited when saitek came out black eclipse . it matches my blue copperhead pretty well , but tarantula perfect . it built gaming . it like they looked standard keyboard said , let make it look cool - so they made it black , gave it nice design , added backlight . ok , where saitek ended . razer goes make removable keys , 10 extra gaming keys swap out ( fps ) , macro functionality built , hypersensitive buttons give faster response time , far better multimedia button set than saitek . additionally , completely backlit keys like saitek contributed glowable keys stripping their paint . razer longer lasting regard . tarantula cons , price . buy it if it must fit your beautiful computer . it tough , innovative , well designed . gj razer	1

minor problems , but very good so far . zire71 , moved up little . this one should shrine built if it ever dies . syncing , use avantgo free service all news , sports , magazines like cnet , pcworld , rollingstone , yahoo , bloomberg , seattle pi much more . syncs addresses calendar using outlook its main database . patience bonus ; when putting videos it , it take up 15 minutes or more . music bit faster , real takes care all . camera very low quality , washed out , poor resolution , poor definition edges , blurred . hard shoot good one , but sometimes ( rarely ) it okay . expect lot touch up when you download pics onto your pc . videos washed out , sound quality okay , distorts badly high volume , like idling hotrod 20 ' sounds like pure static . but camera very handy if you left your digital camera home . i.e. car accidents . voicenotes hangs computer when syncing , i don't use vn anymore . realplayer works great , sound quality excellent sony earbuds . 150+ songs , 60+ pics 30+ vids 1mb sd card w/360mb still free . mediaplayer works great , just drop videos onto desktop converter into palm they go . longest video i it 10 minutes . wifi would nice but that available different model . maybe card coming . software little disjointed , would like databases calendar tie together better . it could benefit lot more automation . calendar invaluable , haven't missed birthday , anniversary or important biz meeting yet . contacts uses outlook its server . windows apps documents-to-go makes it completely win compatible . freezes crashes probably 10x 2 years , up running seconds after reset . far fewer problems than my buddy $500 win handheld . he often must redock reload all his software contacts . huge problem when you're not near your pc , totally cut him off one time , no contact info . see quirks below . age battery may pushing 2 yrs old , battery life down 5 days off charger . durability no glass screen break like old series . bounced off cement floor shirtpocket more times than remember . screen covers must . keep forgetting remove pocket while sandblasting , powerwashing , walking work rainy days . sand once wedged sd card inside , pulled it out needle nose pliers , surprised it still works . power washed entire side building it pocket , set it sun dry it out , still works fine .

my wife came up idea placing all my dvds binders ... i rejected idea first , but then saw her point how our family room started look like video store . now our shelves more space doesn't look so awkwardly colorful -- binders actually match color scheme our house ! i know other review mentions binder doesn't stay closed , but that only if you fill each page two dvd discs -- meaning every dvd other reviewer two-disc set . if you fill binder up its capacity , i see happening -- but if you just your average stack dvds , this product you ! best thing these binders : it highly unlikely anyone ask borrow dvd -- especially those " never-bring-them-back " friends ! without covers , they can't!five star product ... all way	1
this product simply not work . i purchased this item month ago back up my software my old pc ( because i buy new pc ) . after backing up all my photos , music , files extra using trusted drag-n-drop method it seemed though files loaded successfully hard drive . i restarted my old computer verified files drive . everything seemed ok . i then went my new computer upload files but it said files didn't exist . it panic time ( because i already reformatted my old compuer ) so i just lost all my files . i went wd support i told only back my files up using their software called retrospect . if i used drag drop , then who knows what happen . i enraged . external hard drives supposed simple , like portable usb drives , but wd made simple process more difficult it needs . i never recommend or buy western digital product again	-1
it doesn't really work . i mean , unless you're call center lined side side . but if you're office setting , nope . doesn't work . i wanted use this so people passing wouldn't really see my screen . there screens this , but not this one ! while filter nice eyes , way it places screen beats those big clunky guys hang monitor ( plus it subtle ) , i'd trade all this it actually working	-1

i really enjoy idea this item it definitely save some careless people headaches . however , i two macbooks my home gone through six these adaptors eight months , which breaks down 1.33 month ! cords consistently separate connecter . i suppose if your laptop remained desk you didn't travel lot it'd last longer . they need reinforce wire where cord adaptor tip meet . i would not buy one these extra one , because it highly probable you'll issue if you buy them over counter you only get 14 day return policy . least macbook purchase it covers you one-three years depending if you bought applecare .	-1
i owned this tv few weeks very pleased it . only complaint i internal speakers not powerful . normal viewing it probably very good . groups or people watching sports , etc . or room higher noise levels .... you really need external amp speakers . output tv not volume controlled or amplified so external speakers aren't enough themselves . again , very happy picture , tuner , etc . actually , it auto-tuned/setup digital channels through my normal coax-cable without digital box my cable company . this pleasant surprise . i pay hd my cable company so signal sent my home but surprised i didn't need digital box them well .	1

this product works ok basic gigabit switch . it looks very nice home office , not get hot . however , i bought it not nice looks , but looking great functionality . unfortunately , it turned out nothing but trouble . gs608 advertised support jumbo frames ( packets size big 9kb - 6 times more than standard packet 1.5 kb ) . properly configured network clients jumbo network easily reach transfer speeds up 80mb/sec more . but standard packets network barely work up 20mb/sec . so , this switch certainly work faster than old 100mbit switch , but hardly 2 times fast , when jumbo frames it would 8-10 times faster . when i noticed gs608 supports jumbo , it huge factor me go ahead purchase it . i wish i knew it all marketing lie ! upon receiving product i so excited so i disposed packaging ( i know - stupid me ) , only find out day later jumbo not work ( i am senior network engineer , i use jumbo work great success more expensive switches ) . so i could not return or replace product , my multiple calls netgear support resolve this very frustrating led nowhere - they just could not ( or rather would not ) understand what i am talking . so i am stuck now basic gigabit switch , when similar model ( not even pretending support jumbo ) could bought much cheaper other vendor who not false advertising . you decide yourself	-1

i bought one these circuit city $99 . i live st. pete/tampa area . auto station find not very effective . i found clearer ones manually searching . when it connected your ipod , it definetly slows down menus . buttons icarplay 200 also very unresponsive . i would press change station button , nothing happened , then press it again , then it would jump twice . so my advice patience when navigating icarplay menus . sometimes i could get it work acceptable amount static , but then unit would randomly stop working , i get blasted noise my radio cranked up . you cannot adjust volume icarplay , only your radio . i returned unit , i am process getting pioneer head unit built auxillery input front panel . i cannot recommend this unit . it also looks cheap price point . it looks like it should cost $25 dollars . one postive note , it charge ipod fairly quickly . also my wifes car , where she factory stereo static wasn't quite annoying . i amplified tweeters which pick up everything , including static . i also thought putting unit closer stereo would improve sound , oddly it doesn't seem make difference . you could also look one wired ipod adapters such pioneer cd-ib100 ipod adapter .	-1

i waited until i finally received working model post my experience logitech . first , let me begin saying now i working audio station i really love it . product deserves excellent ilounge review it received . sound great . it audio port s-video out port back . i cannot life me understand why there $300 units made apple bose nothing more than some speakers . additionally , am/fm tuner works well . i really only use fm tuner but found it good - better than i expected but not perfect . however , once again , most units this price point not any sort am/fm tuner sacrifice i not willing make . all these reasons i really like audio station . however , if there even product market these characteristics ( am/fm , s-video out , audio ) i would taken my business elsewhere second . my experience logitech terrible . first , i brought home unit best buy early february found it one bad batch went out best buy stores ( see other reviews this page more details which units problem buttons not responding ) . after buttons front unit didn't respond i got online read reviews posted here amazon well logitech own website where they finally admitted this flawed product . i then contacted logitech see product sent me part warranty . representative logitech told me i would better off taking my unit back best buy . i realized i knew more problem audio station than customer service rep after only 20 minutes poking around online . i told him apparantly bad batch went out best buy stores last thing i going waste my time returning product best buy only bring faulty unit back home . i also told him i'd read audio stations coming directly factory reportedly working fine i wanted one those . after some time phone we arranged my unit picked up then i would receive new unit 10 days . 10 days later i called . this first time i found out unit out stock my order backorder . i furious i call find out item backorder . not only this first i heard problem but there nothing they could me . i told first week march they would recieve some warehouse . i waited . 8 days into march i called again . order hadn't made it warehouse . small order due arrive but it not guaranteed i would get one them . again , i very displeased but there nothing i could . this first time customer representative seemed know what he talking actually served advocate me . their credit , i recieve unit out first batch . it arrived relatively quickly works fine . however , it terrible , terrible experience way . if you buy one these , i guarantee buying directly factory . logitech not seem inclined recall their bad units appears content letting customers deal their problem . if you buy best buy or amazon , careful - you may receive one flawed units who knows how long it take replacement get you . it basically took logitech 7 weeks get me new model . i've never so much trouble giving company $300 my money . i plan never shop logitech again	-1

these speaker stands ok . they're solid seem well built . my only problem higher you extend them , more prone they leaning . not big deal , you just adjust center gravity your speaker . i would've given stands 3 stars but i gave them 4 because they're such good relative value . speaker stands so overpriced . that what i like these : you don't feel like you're getting ripped off . just don't expect super high quality .	1
i am very satisfied buy this calculator . his performance very satisfactory up today	1
got this christmas gift my wife . it worked like charm . she guitar tuned up 5 minutes flat . it shuts down automatically if silent 3 minutes - just pin drop silence . led glows green if tuning right or it glows red ... it also highlights letter chord indicate tuning so you know you tuned right one . requires 2 aaa batteries rush out get some this one doesnt come batteries	1

i've this player 6 months now it really fantastic job deinterlacing upconverting . i'd read potential " macro-blocking " issues but not experienced this . i use this conjunction hitachi 51f510 51 " hd monitor ( rear-projection crt ) it excellent job displaying black-level details . faroudja deinterlacer/processor produces extremely film-like image i'm very pleased it performance . there subtle but noticeable difference picture quality versus standard dvd players ... worth buy	1

we got these so we could remote control our tivo anywhere house . black leapfrogs pictured work so amazingly well !! i use them basement or 2nd floor they all talk each other . watch out , though , because when we ordered these , we got newer model/style ( different look , not called leapfrog , but same model number ) they not work all - not even each other - not even 2 inches or 3 feet away !! we returned them next day	1
i compare it other two products i experience . they unreliable , slow demanding . this one , bu-353 , picked up signal before i put it under clear sky other two required . it works even under seat my car ! great product , you not regret if you get one . thank you , globalsat	1
ok maybe it fine print or something but this alarm clock tiny ! i didn't realize it would so small . it pretty much fit te palm my hand	-1
these lables work great . i used several different brands my cd stomper pro program sometimes certain brands not stick or printing looks shoddy . these stick very well cd/dvd matte finish great . i especially like fact you print two different ways either close center hole or further away . i haven't used labeling program very much i am so used one i already . all all great product great price free shipping .	1

this earphone very comfortable . i get one because my cat chewed up my original earphone came my mp3 player . but i'm glad i bought it because it way comfortable than one i using before . it doesn't hurt your ears even after wearing long time , it stays put well too . sound quality okay ; it doesn't blow you away or anything , but you don't really notice it so bad either . most all it cheap . it good deal	1

i just got this , plugged it into my 07 honda fit , it perfect . my favorite feature pauses ipod when power adapter cut off , when i turn off my car ( although probably won't case most american cars ) . line out also adjustable , making it so i don't get static or too quiet signal . i've tried it aux-in ( honda ) tape adapter ( lexus ) , they both work perfectly without any engine noise , like my other car wired fm transmitter ( lexus ) . i got it used only paid $13 it , $18 shipped , so great deal	1
hi there , i am writing this review after used product almost 2 months now . moment i bought my macbook , i looking case would protect my macbook without sacrificing it look . very reason many people buy mac it beautiful design who world would want spoil look how would you actually without hurting it day day use ? voila ! i came across this product . case pretty hard plastic some nice cuts gives good grip while holding/carrying macbook . it covers macbook completely top bottom openings sides different ports . there fin like openings bottom case heat dissipate . way you wouldn't worry macbook overheating . only thing bothers me this product once you put it your mac , it difficult remove it . i sometimes feel i might damage egdes when trying open . this may also because i am not doing it right way ;-) but anyways , i would recommend this product any macbook lover wants protect it scratched or damaged . lok	1

i own sennheiser 500 series headphones compared them these lower cost more stylish skullcandy headphones . sound quality these passable casual listening but nowhere near 500 series quality . also , these not comfortable hours time -- ever 2 hours my ears needed break . otherwise , they alright 35 bucks ..	1
arrived promptly pristine condition . works well my zen vision : . came two adapters -- one car charger , one wall charger . adapters bit tight squeeze plug onto my zvm , but there no epic struggle . all all , decent quality performance	1
sound quality not great , knobs seem flimsy . however , reception fine , product works described . i am overall happy purchase	1
i not see any picture quality improvement using this high priced monster cable . i get same quality pictures my $ 8.00 cable bought biglots . so purchased hdmi cable . but believe me . picture quality my cheap component cable still good ( eventhough hdmi pictures little better ) when i compared pictures hdmi cable	-1
if you're looking something pretty basic , log your speed , distance time - get this . it perfect . i read tons reviews prior purchasing this . some people complained it didn't enough functionality , others complained it not hrm - but , when it all boils down it , this garmin all you really need it . log your speed , distance time . $100 - you can't go wrong . if my 201 ever breaks , i here ordering one right away , no questions asked . definitely worth every penny you spend this - if you're seriously into running , or training marathon . or , just need method keeping track your distance , without drive car around get mileage prior ! :)	1
this my first canon product . my previous printers where hp hp scanner . i feel this mp500 all one great step up perfomance cost per copy my previous printers . photo editing software ok , but if you want photo editing you should consider adobe photo editing software .

i bought this travel alarm target . it shoddy outset , but $10 i managed use it despite dim display tinny alarm one trip . then i realized battery only lasts few weeks . i would spent more batteries than clock itself first year . it also began literally pull apart seams . i mailed clock sharp corporate headquarters nj my complaint received letter back saying it wasn't one their products even though it clearly says " sharp " right front . so either they lying producing terrible products or they not protecting their trademark allowing other companies manufacture shoddy products market them sharp name . either way i could never buy product sharp name it again .... how could i ever sure if it would backed up sharp or not	-1
... system my computer pda ( dell ) because whenever i use " full base " preset mode my winamp listen pop songs ( just test bass ) such thongsong sisqo my hump black eyed pea bass became extremely gargled ruffled unclear . but when i sacrifice bass setting more flat setting it sounds great . my boyfriend computer , though , it worked fine ( gateway tablet pc ) so i am thinking it not headphone problem bass but rather , sound card my systems . nonetheless , after trying this one , shure e2c-g , etymotics er6i , i think sound system this set somewhere shure etymotics all levels ( lows , mid-range highs ) . shures , i found awesome bass , but lacking clarity mid higher notes ( i am no audio expert so please take this grain salt ) while etymotics almost no bass me ( i am not bass head either since i enjoy classical music , techno ( such taq ) video game/anime music ) when i tested bass thongsong sisqo my hump black eyed pea , but little too high pitched hurt my ears . this one seems smoother , in-between sound , but order give you guys better idea i'd probably need invest better sound system go it . i still wish it little more bass get " kick " my pop music when i listen hip hop rap . so far i think it keeper , though . i look forward wearing it airplane this summer way asia	1
it controls everything . it very easy program . it , though , takes while get used especially if you digital cable . up , down , left , right , ok buttons below number buttons instead top	1
it solid little radio held up well through no small amount abuse my part . it fairly user friendly , but could stand better , thus only 4 stars . but once you use it little bit you don't stumble around features .	1
improves reception florida stilletto 100 . significantly better cable . worth cost	1
only negative thing belt-like comes case , too short ring too big case fit , when opened . rest , look speed transfer wonderful	1
these speakers barely audible . so not worth money . they sound like you're listening speaker out soda . i would never but them again	-1
likely discontinued because i bought this sale frys only $4.99 . it worth price . like other reviewer said it dominates electrical receptacle . even four plugger becomes hard use . radio sounds very tinny , but works ok . it picks up local am stations . i it wall workshop where nicely lit digital clock comes handy . one problem i noticed there loud hum when i played radio while it plugged ( nothing else active line ) . i got around this clipping thin ground wire outside antenna . this seemed also boost am reception	-1
before i bought this product i found it difficult find reviews nat . geographic topo state software well maptech terrain navigator software , so i am giving this input future customers . maptech provides demo . i'd say i prefer maptech 3d nat . geographic 3d version . nat . geographic provides more features such greater grid spacing options . but don't expect either print resolution regular 1:24 , 000 usgs maps ; both software brands default larger scale get kind resolution clarity least ink jet printers . national geographic topo 50% default setting results approximate print scale 1:31 , 000 which results very good clarity . however even 1:24 , 000 they legible ( although bit fuzzy ) . they both save you money verses buying regular topo maps ( after 20 or so store-bought maps considering your ink paper costs ) plus they give you advantages if you use gps unit especially overlaying grids , trail markers , etc ., printed-out maps . but don't forget it takes more than ( 4 ) 8 1/2 " 11 " printouts match one regular store bought 1:24 , 000 topo map	1

i really like this cd player , even without remote . all i put it , hit random button , it party time . it plays my cd better than cd player built into my stereo . it mixes songs up just right , some rock , then rb , salsa , etc , etc . bottom line ... this perfect player those who enjoy different types music , like mix it up too . it great parties(i've hosted many , all my guests love music variety . ) price , what you get , added bonus . pioneer always put out great product , once again , they not dissapoin t.t his one best purchases i've ever made , i recommend this all	1

my epson printer finally broke down . physical damage not repairable . i wasn't particularly happy it nor price ink cartridges . i needed new printer fast . some searching internet came up canon ip4200 . i bought this printer amazon $62.00 including shipping . i thought it would cheap stop gap printer until i found good printer . well i don't continue looking . this printer it . it easy set up if you follow quick guide . i went ahead updated all drivers immediately , which simple easy canon web site . manual well written grammar correct , unlike many manuals printed overseas . first thing i print sample page . fast warm up , extremely quiet extremely fast printing . what beautiful copy . next i tried print couple photos using sample photo paper supplied printer . took minute print . prints look every bit good what i would get photo lab . very impressive . addition software very easy use . i not however install web print program , i felt i didn't need it . couple pluses- printer closes up when not use . this helps keep dust minimum . addition when printing it extremely quiet , particularly when compared my epson . big plus haveing paper cartridge which allows me keep letter size paper always ready use top auto feed open different size paper . ink comes 5 cartridges so you only replace one cartridge time . this may or may not cost savings . all all i am extremely impressed this printer . i owned computer printers since mid 1980 , everything dot matrix laser printers . i know technology changes but this printer far best i ever owned . i highly recommend this printer very small business , home based business or home use . you can't go wrong particularly inexpensive price . only fault , which i knew going into deal printer not come usb cable . i extras so it wasn't big deal me , hot swappable you probably one hanging around device . only other problem unlike my epson it not automatically tell me ink level . but minor nit pick . you tell i am highly impressed . lets just see how far ink goes . this printer a+ my book	1
previous model , 101 excellent pair headphones would only set you back ten dollars . sony replaced 101 110 . 110 same good quality sound previous model , but it smaller . even standing still , headphones slip off my ears causing me constantly adjust them . i don't know if it smaller size or angle headset , but fact it won't stay my head makes it totally worthless . i many other kinds headphones never run into this problem before , so it faulty design , not shape my head . i would stay away this model	-1
this seems great router ! it easy set up initially , enough bells whistles savvy people go ahead improve they're security later when they're ready . default setup quite secure , then , if you want poke hole through protection , you fine-tune it more , set it so someone could access specific port your system outside . speed-wise , it seems doing what it supposed , which arrange gaming packets pass through minimum time . vonage packets well routed , also . logs show how many attacks thwarted ... you won't believe how many " messenger " attacks there , plus attempts hacking into every port you imagine . this gives you good sense router doing its work admirably . add this pretty lights , you really great router ! ; -	1
i using canon i550 several years now printing calendars my family around xmas time . each calendar 13 pages i print 20 them ( 13 20 2 sides = 520 ) high resolution . i use lot ink canon cartridges easy refill . print head died i550 , so i searched new canon similar ink cartridges refill . several pixma series cartridges look same small difference they chip them . instead doing visual check cartridge determine if ink low , chip tells printer driver after so many prints . lame , but manageable ! i550 1200 nozzles ( if i remember correctly ) ip6210d 4800 ( again , if i remember correctly ) . anyway , i expecting prints much better than i550 . prints seemed same , so extra nozzles didn't seem make much difference . form factor same , but there lot more buttons features available . i don't ever print directly memory card , so lot features i don't use . i also hoping print speed borderless 8.5 11 prints i use calendar would faster . this printer doesn't seem print much faster than older canon . overall it good printer , but quality probably isn't much better than one lower end pixma printers	1
perennial favorite brother 1240hl works hard modest price fetches one these machines . one most important reasons i originally decided purchase this machine escape netherworld inkjet cartridges . rating 1.6 cents per sheet , not only you save money long run but you avoid scrubbing cleaning cursing every three months . some competitors cartridges fetch upwards 100$ this tidy component suits me fine often i get more than my 3000 sheet rating	1
i hung off this thing pulls ups it before putting my 50 " plasma it . it didn't even flinch . i'm convinced thousands years after i'm dead gone mount still there holding up tv without any problem . i no idea why anyone would pay more expensive mounts .	1
after using this set , i cannot believe how inexpensive they . microphone provides crystal clear recording headphones great . i even used headphones my ipod sound really impressive . if you even half-way thinking buying it , i strongly recommend it	1
i love these headphones ! i taken cache brand , seen it lot skier friends park city area - i ordered these use work , i spend most time computer surrounded others headphones - able comfort high sound quality must ! i wear this average 5 hrs day they awesome ! comfortable , super sound quality , great volume adjustment dial halfway down cord - makes it easy turn it up songs i really want rock out ! ps . my boyfriend dj thinks these headphones bomb well ! if you happened catch swollen members ' latest black magic tour , you might seen limited edition ones skull candy released conjunction band - hot ! get these	1

short : don't buy pair these expecting use them next five years , they simply aren't engineered well ( details follow ) . buy them if you want cheap pair headphones easy carry around , comfortable , block outside noise , sound grea t.t he long : i've owned two pairs these headphones over past few years . my use consists primarily listening music . i'm not throwing them book bag every day , they usually stay home computer , except occasional road trip . second pair recently broke ( point where it not worth repairing ) , so i decided take it apart see if i should purchase third pair . said , here how they fail : 1 . ) volume control cord breaks , result , one or both speakers cuts out intermittently . eventually , there no sound all . this happens consistently . first pair , i tried soldering wires back -- this lasted few hours , until it broke again . problem weight cord pulls directly fragile solder joints -- they inevitably break off , no matter how gentle your daily headphone use . only solution cut volume control out cord tape wires back together ( i've this once each pair ) . unlike volume control , cord properly connected , requires great deal force remove it ( accidentally or intentionally ) . 2 . ) wiring headset breaks , right speaker works intermittently , then fails . this not yet happened my first pair , which i am still using ( albeit , taped-together state ) until i purchase new set headphones . i stopped folding/collapsing it try prevent it failing before i buy new pair ( not same ones , i've decided ) . headband , curved piece springy metal stuck two pieces foam-like material . this metal piece four holes drilled it ( very poorly ) , wire right speaker woven through these holes . result whenever you fold/collapse headphones , wire rubs against sharp metal edges , insulation wears away . eventually it cuts through wire ( which actually * taught * headphone extended-most position ) , it not possible remove replace wire without cutting re-sewing headband . wire i removed broken pair worn down bare metal all four locations where it woven . despite these engineering oversights ( failures ? ) , headphones last year before modifications/repairs required , sound above average ( bass actually pretty decent ) . they easy carry don't require very much power get loud . just don't expect miracles lt ; $30	1
not only this mouse stylish cause , it very easy use high quality product ! i love usb connector resides inside mouse , so you can't lose it . this mouse extremely easy set up when you go need something mobile . it comfortable works extremely well . i use during all my meetings all my coworkers want one ! i highly recommend this product	1
this product replaces 5 gig creative micro which hard drive broke 1 year after minor drop . zen easier download . 2 gig space allows me hold up 5 audiobooks some music . battery lasting 10 hours . sound quality better than micro i appreciate former comments unit not lose its place if unit shut down while playing rather than hitting pause/stop button , which start beginning book or song . i few encounters unit freezing up . i control frequency freezes allowing unit " think " after i touched button or control . it little slow respond commands . if i'm pressing button more than once or hitting back button command get into system controls , i wait until unit gets window i want before telling unit what . no freezing	-1
our unit purchased replace 3+ year old garmin geko 201 geocaching . geko great , but tiny screen " shrinking " due my middle-aged eyesight . also , it getting very tiresome manually entering caches into unit . i considered cheaper garmin legend , but found display less readable than geko . also , it came serial cable , not usb , so i would buy adapter or expensive cable(s ) get it interfaced my notebook . word interfacing computer : prepared work bit accomplish this . usb cable came my sony digital camera worked fine . however , usb drivers garmin website not automatically install set things up . i run driver install executable , locate drivers , then manually run xp hardware install wizard point drivers . not too bad if you experienced , but might challenge if you aren't " techie . " i then setup configured " easygps " interface unit able load . loc files geocaching.com, we off races . this so much easier/faster than entering coords hand ! unit performed well our field tests . color screen bit harder read than geko bright sunlight . also , i found unit would " flip-flop " display when i standing still . no big deal , just start moving it settles down . many useful geocaching specific features . overall , i'm satisfied build quality features .	1

i bought this midi controller mainly playing virtual synthesizers , but uses it hardly limited . it works great so far , just plug it that pretty much it depending program . it very light slim , which makes it very portable . research i've , this seems new model replace oxygen8 , which very similar but lacks 8 programmable buttons slightly heavier . i would highly recommend this anyone who starting get into music production programs like reason , fruity loops , etc or anyone looking good little midi controller . this price you can't beat quality functionality	1
theory , you don't need this device . you've bought hdtv screen , it got input your existing dvd player , you'd think your swank screen electronics would good job dvd signal give you pretty good picture , but they don't . fact it looks worse than your old tv . ok , well , you've also got stylish new blu-ray or hd-dvd player . maybe problem interconnect your old dvd player . your new stylish hi-def dvd uses hdmi -- surely either screen itself or swank new dvd player make sure your dvd looks good your new screen -- but it doesn't , fact it still looks worse than your old tv . practice you really may not need this device . one scenarios painted above may true you . your display or your hi-def player good job taking dvd content upsampling it hi-def screen . perhaps there screens or hi-def players market today this , but i don't own one them . i state certainty base playstation 3 sony kdl46xbr2 not such products . play dvd straight xbr2 , or through playstation 3 xbr2 you want your old tv back . ( well , i . maybe anything looks better than your old tv . ) if , like me , you find your existing video library intolerable your new hi-def rig , then you should consider this player . like other reviewers , i am very pleased it . it makes content watchable . there two provisos . first , you read instructions . dv-981hd not automatically detect output your screen favorite format . read instructions , hit right buttons , or you not get any improvement because dv-981hd output 480p your screen it usual lousy job upconverting . second , no amount processing going take old 480p signal make it look good 1080p signal . you own casino royale dvd , you see it blu-ray store or buddy house , dv-981hd not going make up difference . reasonable expectations . this product good job making your existing dvds look pretty good your hd screen , but they still going look bad comparison right after you've finished watching some 1080p flick . that why you bought your swank new hi-def player first place . here net . if you existing dvd library you want view , not find your current gear produces good picture your dvds , you reasonable expectations what your dvds should look like -- then this player you	1

i work higher education within media services . i've contantly looking reasonable " clicker " control ppt . it easy find/replace aaa batteries first all . you use mouse function double click your file bring up powerpoint . once you're , you push side wheel start , flick it up or down navigate through your slides . then you just hold it down go back edit screen . i tested this laptops both xp 2000 , unit running under minute without me doing anything other than just plugging receiver . also , i wasn't sure when i purchased it but you reset ' id ' number avoid crosstalk units . i don't two yet , so i'm not sure if they retain their new ' id ' after unplugging ... most units i believe . only minor gripe you perform secret handshake activate laser pointer , but even pretty easy . great little device , nice carrying case , perfect price range	1
we spent 6 months trying decide if we would use portable player enough justify purchase , if so , which one buy . bittorrent user , i lot divx files already , so when i saw player capability this price , i pulled trigger . very good decision . we've using player heavily month now , we very satisfied , often wondering why we waited so long buy one . we got it before long roadtrip ( 7 hours each way ) , it made travel much more pleasant my 4-year-old . he actually looked forward getting back car so he could watch his shows ! i able fit 10 hours kids shows one dvd-r using free divx software player/burner windows . phillips portable played all dvds , dvd-rs , dvd-rws we've thrown it without slightest skip or freeze . i can't even say our full size home player . it feels very sturdy , held up perfectly so far even hands rather rugged 4-year-old . battery life very good , but i don't any specifics . longer than 5 hours , least , which seems good me . included adapters allow you use it plugged wall or cigarette lighter without battery attached if desired ( much lighter way ) . car adapter cord long enough reach dash back seat big vehicle , but probably not third row mini-van . screen not huge , especially when viewing 4:3 aspect content . 7 " diagonal measurement really only applies 16:9 ( widescreen ) content . built-in speakers ok sounding , suprizingly loud . there 2 headphone jacks , which outstanding feature so you don't use splitter . included av cable lets you hook it your composite inputs your tv or vcr , so you use this your home entertainment center . i considering buying both home divx player , car video system . this player satisfies both requirements much less than i planning spending either one . this qualifies best consumer electronics purchase i've made last 2 years -- very pleasant surprise	1

much like previous reviewer i urge you not spend lots money hdmi cables . hdmi specs state only one pixel out every billion lost , therefore there no reason , no matter what cable made , spend money hdmi cables . search internet , you find plenty good 10ft hdmi cables $10 or less . digital zeroes ones . hdmi case , either cable connected or it isn't	-1

omg , i got these headphones they suck !!! i am not even kidding , they probably worst headphones world worst headphones i've my life ... first all , when you listen music there loud hissssss noise backround , second , these don't even fit over your freakin ears ... haha , also , they tooo bulky , you can't anything them ... sound quality ok ... but if your looking noise cancelling headphones , i dont recommend these , i recommend sony fontopia headphones or 120 dollar sony noise cancelling headphones ear buds not too bulky ( availible brookstones ) ... now those what you call great , these panasonic earfones just horrible compared these , it only takes out like little noise , but sony 120 dollar ones brookstone takes out 70% noise ! that amazing , it probably why they so expensive ... well i leave but this my advice you don't ever ever buy these headphones your life !!! they horrible !!! hope this helped	-1
this 32 " lcd aquos quite possibly best size/quality/price combination market . picture clearer than i could ever hoped , better than much more expensive ( heavy ) plasma screens . sharp also managed get close true black possible lcd , colors vivid true . setup couldn't easier , there more inputs ( 6 ) than most people devices input . importantly , there two hdmi inputs so digital cable dvd no longer make analog losses previous gold standard component inputs . hdmi , everything that digital stays digital , all one cable . plus your video games hooked up two component ( or two composite ) inputs . screen size , those tempted go larger should remember two things : 1 ) resolution 37 " screen same 32 " , resulting larger picture but one which more pixelated ; 2 ) picture so clear , you view screen quite clearly much farther distance than you would imagine . combine all this sharp emmy-winning pixel technology refresh rate only 6ms , opposed 8ms most lcds this range -- meaning virtually no lag even fastest action pics or sports events -- you tv virtually no flaws . two 10w speakers more than adequate until you get your optical dolby surround system set up	1
they really suck . many portable speakers 20-40$ range sound pretty good these should fall five dollar range . dont bother	-1

first rule microphones , " no one microphone perfect every purpose . " rule two , " experiment different mics different applications find your signature sound . " i've used shure sm58 their ancestors relatives back 1968 . i primarily used them broadcasting recording spoken word content but i used ( still use ) them singing some back up vocals . sm58 one thing well vocal performance when used very close mouth public address use . some people , me included , actually sound better more comfortable live performance setting when using mic , shure sm-57 . sm-58 very good vocal mic some people probably best choice . example , anyone who not resist putting mic right up against their lips while singing probably want sm-58 . people softer or weaker voices want sm-58 . sm-58 highly directional noticable yet manageable proximity effect ( which means bass increases closer you get . ) this mic not pick up well much over 8 inches away . reason so many singers think you supposed shove microphones practically inside your mouth because ball type shure vocal mics require you get them very close or they don't sound right . other hand , sm-57 sounds best several inches away user mouth works fine up 12 inches away . while sm-58 certainly number one professional pa vocal mic , there precious few other uses it because it colored sound prominent frequency response boost upper midrange plus sound source very close before it picked up clearly . it works ok conga drums like , but sm-58 last thing you'd want use mic sax or guitar . personally these mics not best my mic technique or basic nature my voice , but some people they sound great . live vocal mic works best me shure sm-57 windscreen . however other people sm-58 works better . it depends your voice what you want mic . if you very deep voice , sm-58 might second best choice after sm-57 which better low frequency response . one certain advantage sm-58 excellent gain before feedback capability . this mic turned up louder than almost any other mic without annoying pa squeal . advantage sm-58 it still available ( slight extra cost ) built-in on/off switch . sm-58 ball shaped grills very sturdy even if you should dent one you get replacement which screws right ten dollars . i've seen sm-58 dented , rusty , dusty , smoked up , spit into , pieces missing slammed into hardwood stage full weight boom stand adding mass fall yet i've never seen but one stop working malfunction due on/off switch got dirt it . all pro-line shure mics top quality . pro line shures also hold their value well . if you buy one decide you don't like it , you get what you paid it ebay . i would compare many mics possible before buying one . senneheiser evolution mics sound really good too worth look . sm-58 number one on-stage vocal mic forseeable future because most people follow crowd instead actually trying out different mics picking one works best their particular voice . these things so durable even if they stopped making them today they'd still around 20 years least	1

first off , i need let everyone know i ended up buying this tv local store not amazon . i'm writing this review because i used reviews amamzon help me make my buying decision am appreciative reviews other buyers during my research . bottom line , one other reviewer stated , you get what you pay . i took my three small children into local electronics store , while standing front wall tvs ( both plasma lcd ) , asked them pick tv best picture . not surprisingly , they all picked pioneer . anyone who kids tell you they really say what they think . tv best picture far . there no comparison lcd tvs either . don't let anyone try tell you lcd longevity or picture quality . i easily see pixelation fast moving images when i checking out 1080p lcds . there also alot talk concerning plasma burn-in issues . this may issue past but i've no problems all . during first 100 200 hours viewing , just go user-defined settings dial down brightness contrast . also , go power set " save2 " avoid stationary logos much possible . after this break-in period , you put settings whatever you like . absolutely five stars	1

i originally purchased 56 " samsung 1080p dlp ( hl-s5687w ) amazon . unfortunately , i one few who could see rainbow effect single chip dlp color wheel . rainbows very distracting i couldn't live set . amazon couldn't anything me such exchanging set different model . fortunately , samsung willing work me gave me option exchange/upgrade different set . i chose go hp-s6373 couldn't happier . i am really into picture quality , this set best i've seen anywhere . i 65 " crt rptv three half years , although it isf calibrated , samsung plasma looks much nicer . when i decided get new hdtv five months ago , i went through two sony 1080p sxrds ( kds-60a2000 ) , both ended up green blob problems . then i tried samsung dlp , which rainbow effect i mentioned earlier . i spent so much time researching hdtvs , sony samsung models i tried arguable two best sets available time ( i spent way too much time avs forum ) . anyhow , i am very happy samsung hp-s6373 . it minimizes two big concerns people plasmas - glare burn - using filterbright plus automatic pixel shift technology . you still see some reflection brightly lit room , but there no silk screen effect ( sse ) , which very noticeable sxrd dlp . i'd rather little glare instead sse . both sony sxrd samsung dlp 1080p sets . i understand why higher resolution important , especially 1080i/1080p material but i honestly tell you my 1366 768 plasma looks much nicer than either 1080p set . granted this may due my 12 foot viewing distance , but ultimately best picture up viewer 1080p sticker doesn't necessarily mean picture quality one set better than . i constantly found myself tweaking sony sxrd samsung dlp sets get best picture . i used service user menu tweaks recommended settings cnet avs forum , but never completely satisfied . hp-s6373 plasma didn't look so hot out box either , but after setting it movie mode ( no other adjustments ) , it looks amazing . it probably not completely fair compare rptvs plasma , but i am just providing my opinion based sets i've . reviewer mentions build quality leaves much desired . i haven't owned any other plasmas , but compared rptvs i've owned , this set pretty solid . tv level stand , so perhaps reviewer bad stand . only annoyance i set i hear slight buzzing noise when volume muted bright image displayed . i can't hear it where i sit haven't noticed it during normal viewing . i just read complaints buzzing some samsung 50 " sets , so i listening it . i get within couple feet set hear it , like i mentioned , it only audible bright images . compared much more significant green blob rainbow problems i previous sets - this non issue . sorry write so much , i just figured i would share my experience incase anybody else much trouble i've finding hdtv they happy . most people ( including my wife ) would completely happy sony sxrd or samsung dlp	1

this affordable microphone perfect complement my olympus ws-300 digital audio recorder . i took it me overseas reporting trip , it functioned very well . i used it settings both crowded noisy , quiet solitary . mike handled everything well . clip sturdy never caused problems during my two-week journey , which i used device nearly every day several hours day . wind guard ( small round styrofoam-type covering ) worked well dampening extraneous noise . it picked up primary speaker voice easily . when i worked translator , i clipped mike his lapel it able clearly record his voice . interview subject more difficult hear , but that expected . extremely long cord positive people using video equipment who want stand long distance away subject . otherwise , i suggest you keep wire tied up rubber band or provided twisty-ties . i can't comment battery life small watch-type battery that included . i also purchased cheaper lavalier mike ( no wind protection , short wire ) but i recommend paying little extra this higher-quality gear . it well worth your money , sound quality very noticeable compared my built-in olympus mike . ( keep mind this monaural mike , so you don't get stereo sound .	1

lets face it , you're not buying nike + ipod its stopwatch feature , you're buying it all other wonderful calculations it . after couple weeks , system pretty much waste me . i wear sensor shoe pouch which designed sensor ( nike likely never make shoes fit my 10eeee feet ) . i read reviews shoe pouch system works fine . here some examples my results : 80 minute easy run , appx . 6 miles , system reported i run 1.26 miles . 25 minute easy run , appx . 2.5 miles , system reported i run . 21 miles . 2 times around same track , fast pace , system reported i run . 21 . 24 km ( same lane ) . nike admits system 10% off before calibration . i couldn't get it calibrate because it kept indicating i not gone far enough ( although i ) . nike + ipod forums , i've seen good deal complaining system often off 20 - 30% or more , even after calibration . my results seem much worse than average . i'm used good bit " odd behavior " electronics software , so i'm willing take good bit stride . nike + ipod , however , performed far worse than anticipated out box . me , nike + ipod essentially stopwatch linked my ipod nano ( which makes it good deal harder use than stopwatch my wrist ) , nice voice , give me feedback how much time i've running or how much time i left . since many nike + ipod website features distance sensor ( log your miles , challenge others , etc . ) those features worthless me . i'll still use it until battery runs out ; why not ? i'll glad update this review if it starts working better . but so far , i think two stars generous .	-1

these really quite surprising phones . i tried them excellent system they better than my five hundred dollar kosses . my ipod they far superior sound quality etymotics i using , though bit harder get stay my ears . even when playing tracks transferred lossy format they sound pretty good not tinny etymotics . but when i play cuts recorded apple lossless format they really shine . why ? well , bass response excellent , high end excellent , mid-range pretty good , better higher volume . these phones really make your ipod experience very rich one . i listen mostly classical music jazz . i am happy	1

excellent product , well worth money ! cons i've listed fact just minor irritations me , but certainly worth consideration anyone purchasing this product . pros : * faxing quality fast clear . * scanner quality very good . document scanning fast great clarity . * copy quality impressive . documents almost good original , document feeder you just walk away come back when job complete . cons : * i've hooked up my answering machine through mfc . due it answering every call check fax , it defeats caller-id function telephone which it connected . * power sucker ! this thing uses alot power it job . so whenever i send print-job mfc , lights dim momentarily . also , it draws too much power connected through my 1500-watt ups . * printed/copied documents come out recessed bay , which irritating trying fish out smaller paper sizes	1

i found really good deal [ ... ] this monitor , i say i no regrets buying this 22 " ' economical ' monitor ! i've looking large lcd screen while , but prices good 22 " monitors pretty steep , until i came across this one . monitor itself bright , crisp , clear option set it 1680 1050 ( looks ) fantastic ! i'm also gamer , so far games i played ( prey , rtcw , half life 2 , splinter cell ... etc . ) , all look great ! i notice " backlight bleeding " ( which everyone feels compelled mention ) , but that only when booting up or something requires dos mode , basically ... it really doesn't bother me all . bottom line , if you get this under $300 ( including taxes/shipping ) , then buy it !! it well worth it	1

i bought this cleaner replace old maxell manual cleaner served me very well . i doubtful it would work because price so reasonable . though it worked majority disks i've tried it , this cleaner lite users only . if you often encounter disks require more intensive cleaning , then skip this one . those lite users , i would recommend using spray glass cleaner rather than included spray . regular use this cleaner eventually required you purchase new cleaning pad . problem you'll buy entire accessory kit full things you most likely never need just get one little pad . i'm not fan hidden costs . honestly , i haven't found replacement pad pad yet i anticipate i'll eventually just throw whole thing away get cleaner . tadaaa ! now you're back where you started .	1

i purchased this clock replacement older timex travel alarm clock i lost . while this model functions basic level , it disappointing overall . reviewer mentioned , this clock gains time quickly . after just couple days it minutes ahead actual time . if you only use clock weekend trips this probably won't much inconvenience , but longer trips or regular use home , this bit nuisance . i honestly say my entire life i never any clock , watch , or other appliance so poor keeping correct time . i also disappointed quality indiglo backlight this clock . my last travel alarm , well my indiglo watch , indiglo backlight bright makes characters easy read dark . however , this clock indiglo backlight feeble comparison . it just bright enough qualify usable , but if your eyesight isn't great combination weak backlight fact you probably aren't wearing contacts or glasses middle night may make this clock difficult you read . far user interface concerned , time display very large , but other on-screen items , such " alarm " indicator , not necessarily obvious quick glance display . indiglo button , you see picture , middle face unit . my last travel alarm placed this button top unit . if you imagine trying illuminate your clock pitch dark room , you probably guess which location more convenient . fortunately , all buttons you need set clock easily located lower half face unit . setting time/alarm clock pair up/down buttons move time one ( if you press release ) or 15 ( if you hold ) minute increments . this particularly useful making small time adjustments backwards . overall i very disappointed this clock . it lacks some ease-of-use features i'm used , it suffers poor craftsmanship . it relatively inexpensive it hasn't technically broken , but if i could go back time i would most certainly purchase different travel alarm	-1
i just got cyberpad last week i used it few days . product just i expected , thin lightweight . software easy install although i agree earlier reviewer they could better job documentation ( fact they need correct major typos " manual " such change " lunch " " launch " ! ) . pen indeed bit bigger than what i'd like i hope they come up thinner replacement . notes captured very well eventhough my handwriting not very good ( specially fast paced meetings ) . me one biggest benefits evernotes software package which comes cyberpad . evernotes , i catalog organize all notes taken assign tags specific categories which makes it breeze find my notes later ( which problem i trying solve cyberpad ) . so , i would rank it 5-star except pen size	1

sonic impact t-amp amazing product , even more so considering selling price . it main selling point device enable portable music player play through small set speakers , but it also developed cult following among high-end audio crowd . more second . t-amp small , smaller than you would think looking photos , very lightweight even when loaded eight aa batteries it takes power it . two battery compartments actually take up most space inside t-amp case , amplifier itself so small if you placed it centered top standard business card you would still 3/8 inch border around all four edges ( yes , i this , measured ) . t-amp very simple operate . connect pair speakers terminals back , plug whichever music player you like into back using standard 1/8 inch stereo plug , turn it you listening music ! black circle front case t-amp only control , which both power switch volume " knob " . knob actually flush front case , which makes it easily operated your thumb , feel perfectly natural ipod owners . there also provision external power supply back used ac adapter . t-amp run long time battery power , most people skip ac adapter . couple potential drawbacks , which minor enough considered " nit-picky " , speaker terminals only accept bare wire , it needs fairly thin ( 18-gauge ' lamp cord ' would pushing it ) , people expecting t-amp very loud may disappointed . 15 watts rated maximum output , so expect it able deliver 8-10 watts real life . sound : better speakers you plug into it , within reason , more you expect blown away quality sound . if you efficient loudspeakers , 90db or higher , t-amp fill medium-sized room wonderfully clear , detailed , undistorted sound unless you try push it past it power limit . i said earlier , this little amp developed quite following audiophile crowd , group not impress easily , especially something sells this cheaply . understand , we talking people who won't bat eye spending hundreds dollars one set interconnect cables , not mention what kind money " good " ( their definition ) amplifier cost . yet , many these same people posted bulletin boards all over internet singing praises t-amp , comparing it favorably high-end amps selling over 100 times cost t-amp . yes , 100 times . i am musician training/trade , i also work repairing high-end audio equipment . i skeptical first all hype audio discussion boards , but i figured 30-or-so dollars wasn't too much spend satisfy my curiousity . i amazed what i heard first time i tried t-amp . it good enough people may want careful what signal they feed into it because , most part , what goes into this thing definitely going come out louder other end . if you never able tell difference sound high-bitrate mp3 low-bitrate mp3 same song before , you able t-amp . fact , you able tell difference high-quality cd player " normal " cd player playing same disc . it good . t-amp built tripath t-series amplifier chips , success t-amp caused higher-end audio equipment manufacturers take notice . it not uncommon now find higher powered versions t-amp chip selling stereo amplifiers costing well excess $4000.00 . if you decide try one , you won't disappointed , unless you wanting something insanely loud .	1

i've owned many supposed " universal " remotes over years - they all disappointed one way or several . my needs fairly simple ... device turn on/off amp , tv , cable , vcr , dvd cd players . also duplicate many their separate functions . this surprisingly inexpensive remote it all . functions it doesn't duplicate automatically , it learn other remotes . it also learn operate series commands push one button . instructions fairly easy understand , i am completely satisfied . i never would imagined such cheap device could operate so comprehensively . i'm very grateful other reviewers here rating this so highly . i probably never would considered this one my own , their recommendations saved me good bit money	1

first off let me tell you what equipment i'm running it . it basic set up :d lp tv , sony dvd player , directv dvr , pioneer receiver . hdmi only running dvd v.v ery basic . first all programming via web breeze really . no hangups so many mentioned . i 20 minutes . basically long you get names model numbers your equipment you ok . i called direct tv get exact model number my dvr . after programming , oh i dsl internet , so it wasn't slow , remote immediately took over my others . it worked right off . some mentioned syncing problems . if you don't leave remote facing devices long enough when you use activity selections(watch tv , watch dvd , listen radio etc . ) then sometimes it turn first couple components not other , but help function quickly takes care this . you also get it all back synch if you simply press device button turn off other equipment then start new activities button again . i haven't really problems reading screen many mentioned functions pretty easy come soon you get used layout remote . it turns itself off after two hours non use when you pick it up it turns itself back . reason behind this particular remote purchase me ease set up activities buttons layout . i wanted something would user friendly so when i someone watching my house they could easily perform basic functions system like watching dvd without hitting wrong buttons messing up presets such receiver or things like tha t.t he only reason i don't give this five stars remote feel bit fragile side if you kids i could see them dishes out some mean punishment this thing . instance if you press soft number buttons harshly they get stuck under casing . this happened once . not big deal but still . i would say this not child friendly remote let them use ones came devices instead . other than . great product so far so good	1

i tried this out slim out my collections which grown too unweildly , like many others here , i'm sure . :) what i really like these besides slimness how it locks . case lock really simple , two clicks corners slotted grooves edges . i'm fine this opposed those additional hinges which flip over edge . it not guvmint secrets locked away . i've dropped these accident , normal waist height , it didn't pop open . that all you really need . inside locking . i like this one very much well since it easy utilize . there ubiquitous circle middle , but right side , when you push down center , it like opening box center edge moved away , disc free removed . otherwise , it stays nicely . i've transfered my normal dvd sleeves into slim ones shaving off 1/4 off left right . full width 10.5 " , so you play around your own which side dvd sleeve content you want keep . bear mind though keep titles spine , you let spine b/w 5 " 5.25 " mark . if anyone wants get me some birthday gift , aug 13th , feel free click my wish list . :) clear ones though , i don't know why coloured or black ones more expensive . it doesn't matter , i've got sleeve artwork inserts them , ones i use my productions , clear ones allow additional space info artwork around disk edges	1

i use this xbox 360 gaming computer graphic work . first off , it 1 1 pixel mapping , which means , your picture complete down exact pixel . hardly any monitors this feature this screen size . ones nearly double price , even then there only 3 models i know , 2 them around $2000-$2500 , other around $1800 . back 12/06 . what this means under grand , i beautiful 37 lcd computer monitor , dwarfs my two samsung 20 inchers retail over $500 each ( because resolution ) . i deal colors fine image details , computer monitor , it unbelievably great . gaming ... i connect my 360 vga cable , set resolution tv 360 1080p voila . awesome . i just bought ghost recon 2 ( graw 2 ) , which supports 1080p . it beyond description . gears war beyond description even though it not 1080p game . if you wondering it affected my kills/death ratio graw ... they gone 10/10 15/5 . sometimes even 20/5 . you see enemies you would never able see regular screen . this only tv i know you get 1080p throug component cables . yes right . i've never tried it , but it supports it . ghosting ... i've yet notice it any game . speaking connections , this everything , vga , dvi , s-video , composite etc ., but only one hdmi . could problem when you get more than one hd device , but i wouldn't hold against this product . movies .. i not watched many it yet . not watched any hd movies it all . i can't comment , but i notice some motion blur close up man face when he interviewed during special feature " making star wars . " other words , it wasn't shot like normal moview would . i've never seen anything during normal scenes . picture quality nice , but i really can't compare it because i don't know what hd movies look like . put it this way , it plenty better than my previous tv movies . television ... it doesn't come tuner , but you get one your cable guy form cable box ( or satellite ) . i not watched any tv it . i can't give opinion . overall , this probably one best purchases i made long time . price , i don't think you go wrong . i am considering buying one so i dual 37 . screens , already would , but they jacked price up right after i bought it . bottom line if you looking gaming tv , this it hands down .	1

when you move significantly above $100 mark headphones , one naturally expects superior sound build quality - things found competing phones like grado sr125 , alessandro ms1 , or even sony mdr-v6 . one thing , body these headphones made relatively flimsy plastic , lends little way confidence product . sound - part matters - may impress neophyytes their strong bass , but balance richness tone sorely absent . perhaps that why may triport owners find themselves defecting other products . bose earned name through aggressive advertising name recognition , but if you're savvy shopper ( willing look some superb competing headphones ( sometimes half price ) , you your music better place	-1
listen up !!! these babies some best my experience , which rather limited . i say , though , i've heard some things songs i didn't realize there , instance : song , " downward spiral , bottom " , nine inch nails off , " further down spiral " amazing song anyway , when i heard it through these phones , i heard sounds coming , not only my right left , but underneath me , within my head , well undefined place away me . it weirdest thing . course those sounds came me right left , but headphones brought out those strange dimensions music . all frequencies superb , bass full . good metal , country , really anything not too soft , it open design , so real quiet music tends drowned out outside noise , like my vacuum . one caveat : cord substantial , 10 feet long . i would rather 4 foot cord or so , but that simply because i use it my portable , not my home stere o.o verall , very good comfortable headphones . get ' em !!!	1

sport bose bashing aside , keep mind these relatively small enclosures two 2.5 inch drivers crate rear sound stage much larger than their size might suggest , so without overly fussy placement . there always seems someone out there who sets their surround settings " large " , pumps up bass , then complains two 2.5 inch drivers small vented plastic enclosures " no lows " , sound distorted . neither vcs 10 center channel or 161s play ear-busting levels -- trade off small drivers small enclosures , theatre surround settings bass management must set accordingly . doing this , bose 161s ( especially when paired vcs 10 ) produce clear focused dialog convincing surround effects smaller rooms . you " better " ? sure , larger enclosures , bigger drivers play louder lower but doesn't mean bose don't deserve consideration basis good performance given their style size . if you throw little money issue want really exceptional performance relatively small speaker enclosures , consider legacy audio victoria speaker system very good multi channel theatre amp separate processor like those offered adcom or parasound .	1

last reviewer stated center channel speaker " barely audible " speakers " sounded horrible " . there nothing wrong these speakers . they made high-quality components probably your best bang your buck . first , first reviewer probably trying listen stereo sound through his surround sound system . reason there very little sound coming through center channel probably because receiver makes center channel phantom channel , where left right signals stereo sound combined put through center " filler " speaker . or ... if reviewer hooked up his dvd player receiver using just two rca inputs , he get stereo sound here well , even though dvd encoded dolby digital surround . receiver try make stereo sound into surround using dolby prologic surround when given stereo inputs , this less-than-digital performance , sometimes needing some extra tweaking receiver order get ample dialogue . bottom line : everything depends receiver connections you using your dvd player receiver . if receiver not quality , it may not put enough power into speakers , or it may put unclean power speakers causing them distort . if you not using digital coaxial cable or optical cable your dvd player your dolby digital receiver ( make sure it decoder ) , then sound most likely stereo sound synthesized into doly prologic surround , which simply mixes channels into center , where some dialogue could lost . if you right equipment you know how set it up correctly , you love these speakers	1
i bought 10-pack tdk tapes april , 2005 - boxes say : " tdk - superior quality - standard t-120 " - " vhs standard grade " - " videotape everyday repeated use recording " . tapes work so far , grainy blurry pictures colors not vivid sound quality horrible distorted . packaging not up amazon standards . video tapes not wrapped or protected inside box this probably why i least 1 broken tape ( plastic cassette broke off ) . they not protected box all . i'm very disappointed these video tapes . not sure if " tdk " going down hill or if all big name brand video suppliers lowering their standards . this first time few years i bought new vhs tapes they low quality i would expect generic no-name brand tape . since i need video tapes now , i forced order tapes other companies . i trying some other brands see if tdk standard tapes only brand name tapes lowering their standards . i'm going try some maxell rca standard tapes hope better luck	-1

truth , i'm cheapskate . this particular model happens cheapest they stock my local office depot , so i've kind loyal logitech customer years without particularly vested brand itself . first , good part : mouse very comfortable hand . while not ergonomic , it works perfectly if you mousepad built-in wrist support ( common freebie tech tradeshows -- testimony my cheapness ) . installation , there no installation -- plug it into usb port you're ! control good crisp . wheel gets job . it should also noted it doesn't come any bells whistles -- all . other mice multiple wheels , built-in scroll buttons special keys everything except fetch you coffee . this model only comes two buttons wheel , period , but if you're like me you'll just appreciate simplicity . bad news buttons wear out within 6-9 months . this especially notable left button , which gets most wear . 6 months , you start pushing only towards outer edge click register . 9 months , you press pretty hard . if you make it all way year , you're stuck hammering upper-left corner like madman every time you need click something . that only bad thing it though , price it easy enough up new one when old mouse starts showing signs wear	1

this tv incredible value ! i've owned it over 6 months never one problem . initially , i installed my subwoofer it , but sound speakers come set so good i rarely turn subwoofer . picture excellent all angles . people who see this always assume i paid much more it . yes , you'd probably get better paying 5 times this price ... but technology improves so quickly ( this one upgraded downloads ) , why pay more . i mine living room since i sit closer tv there . my bedroom , which larger i'm further tv , i'd probably go up next largest size . i love this one lightweight enough move ease ... myself . it world improvement if you still watching tv one those large square box , heavy weight tvs . price low enough when new technology requires me replace it , i'll feel if i've gotten great value money spent move next upgrade	1
we got this bedroom tv so we could watch dvds together after kids go sleep , it fantastic ! there essentially no setup , plugged it right directv receiver it looks great . we also got associated mounting arm easily mounted it wall giving us extra floor space . overall , this great deal -- this good size average bedroom . i think 37 " version this might overkill	1
i am using this my children cd-rom games . it also holds dvd cases nicely . my children 3 , 5 7 tend not put discs back when they them or can't find games they want play . this storage container makes discs easy find clean up . it also sturdy much nicer appearance than some other storage solutions . i leave them shelf it keeps things orderly while looking good	1

i like fact you could change fan speed . 2 available rpm choose , i use low browsing high gaming or when i'm defraging my hd . temp drop noticeable . some people mentioned fan noise bit loud . when you it high speed , fan noise noticeable but i don't think it bad . blue lights pretty nice too considering i white laptop it glows over my lid . definitely recommended people who would mind little fan noise not willing pay like $40+ cooler	1

i bought this memory my z610i sony-ericsson . when i first saw memory i could not believe how small it . it pretty small , less than finger nail it fast . i really like this memory it came all adaptors using it normal memory stick or sd . only thing not so cheap , i feel it could less expensive	1
i initially dismissed this product because it looked cheap , seemed priced accordingly . but after reading some reviews , i decided buy it risk whopping 24 bucks . it great buy . what it - it switches your vga monitor two computers , your usb keyboard usb mouse . it two buttons device control switching . it two usb ports go your keyboard your mouse . it three vga ports . one goes your monitor ( you use cable you already ) . two go your two computers . interestingly , kvm-to-computer cable , special cable included ( two them ) , also carries usb signal . cable splits computer end you connect vga connector usb connector their respective ports your computers . what it not - it not switch audio . it not designed switch additional usb devices , although it may work some devices not need high bus-power , if your keyboard acts unpowered hub . device itself powered computer usb bus it not separate power supply . this exactly what i needed . kvm stands keyboard , video , mouse . that all i wanted switch two computers ( mac linux pc laptop ) . i considered other kvm devices , they more features such audio switching special software , but they cost much more than this simple device . package comes software switching , but it windows only . docs say it hot key , scroll lock key hit twice succession , controls switch . however , it not work me , probably because my mac keyboard which not dedicated scroll lock key . however , device sitting next my keyboard , i just hit appropriate button ( 1 or 2 ) switch . it quite small . switching nearly instant . what could more simple than ? few things i tried ... it works fine 1600x1200 , 75 hz . my normally used mac resolution 1280x960 75 hz . my linux laptop old only externally output 1024x764 60 hz , which also works fine . i not see any degrading picture quality going through this kvm . my monitor 19-inch crt . summary , trendnet tk207k 2-port usb kvm switch works great great price . if simple two-way kvm vga/usb what you need , i recommend this one	1

i never give out 5 star reviews , because i never feel any product perfect , or complete . but i say , this definetely best ipod case out there . my first case agent 17 ( or it 18 ? ) ipod photo , which i " thought " i liked alot until i opened case found ipod screen all scratched . since i bought video ipod , i gone through least 3 cases , read extensive reviews least half dozen . what convinced me buy this these : ( 1 ) it currently top rated apple store , ( 2 ) myriad color options , ( 3 ) it belkin , which very respectable company , one first jump wagon ipod accessories since its revolution . i am glad i bought it , even though most reviews hint natural scratching outer case . well , i don't really care long ipod itself protected . that reason why i bought it first place . case comes ready both 30gb 80gb sizes ( they supply extra bigger back case 80gb , which what i ) . case fits perfectly , even protects wheel ( option not available most cases ) , there gaps every single outlet ( hold , earphones , dock ) so you needn't take ipod out unless necessary . color awesome , which tempting me go ahead buy case switch two . it sold via jr huge plus . their shipping time excellent . couple days latest . go get yours . you not disappointed .	1
i purchased my eton here amazon $99 received mine several weeks ago great anticipation . wait worth it , since digital tuning very good reception make radio well worth price paid . i own large collection shortwave radios feel this radio competes well some my classic 70s/80s era receivers which extremely selective cost more than eton/grundig hardware . only minor dig i cheap nature tuning knob desire venier tuning control . i fudge tuning bit fine touch , but it take some attention , especially some stations drift out . casual listening , this radio extremely stable very good field use trips . i fired mine up out box immediately impressed solid feel large high-quality antenna . leather grip heavy-duty feel more than compensate my tuning knob complaint i feel this unit competes well my smaller grundig radio sees active use when camping hiking . i am uncertain if am band tuned using ferrite internal antenna this model testing unit external antenna see if dxing am stations possible this model ... it probably standard ferrite antenna but it sure would nice find i extend function s350 this pleasant hobby dxing remote am stations . one other nice modification would eton evolve s350dl support simple circuit memory stations . it would logical thing would worth few extra dollars some more intelligence built into rig . overall , $99 i spent , very good deal radio i'll own very very long time . if this your first shortwave radio , it good purchase good introduction hobby	1

after jumping then off this system band wagon 40 times last month , my wife i finally decided get this system . when i decided i finally going break down get some speakers , cause ones my tv going out , i originally saw this system infomercial fell love it , just because it simplicity . after reading reviews online , i admit i leery it , since it didn't really shine some people . but after visiting factory store this last weekend las vegas getting hear this system , i realized what it , it outstanding . first all , if you wanting full 5.1 or 7.1 system , don't buy this . if you want run wires get true surround sound , this system isn't what you looking . know what you buying people . but if you looking adequate solution better sounding tv , games dvd , then this system you . these little speakers subwoofer able bounce sound off walls make you feel like you surrounded sound . we big living room this set up , it works great . 15 25 room vaulted ceilings , it still sounds great . we watch mission impossible ii our first full length movie it delivered like theater . we then put grand daddy tests me . jurassic park . t-rex scene clear loud scary ever . set up really easy too . took me 2 hours , but because i really careful keep my cords organized also really lazy not pulling tv out wall . dvd until runs well my direct tv xbox . i can't wait load up game see how sound . far regular tv viewing , we watched grammy last night , you could hear crowd noise like it around you , not just coming you . all all , this unit exceptional . what it , it great . true , it isn't same true surround sound system , but i don't think it claims . we bought this system starter , cause when we build new house we going run speaker wire true system them move this one our master bedroom future use . we used this 10 year old tv too , it like tv brand new . we plan adding 46 flat screen near future , so i only imagine experience get better . my recommendation , take these reviews ( even mine ) grain salt . try find factory store where you go hear them person , then come here buy if you want . they also great deals refurbished systems , which carry same warranty new systems . you save 300 bucks just buy one someone returned because they didn't like it get same warranty .	1

these great headphones . i am very picky sound but not want pay high prices . therefore there compromise , but not much . these sound great all types music go louder than many over head phones . i compared it 5 or 6 other headphones below $30 . i compared against jensen full size headphones i put aside comparing less than one minute . then i compared against phillips hsp2500 . [ phillips sounded louder but bass muddier . music vocal didn't separate clearly . ] again , i compared this sony mdr-xd200 . sony mdr-xd200 louder due its sensitivity but didn't give clear sound . only headphone i liked besides these koss ur21c but lacked loudness long cord . $7 above average sound quality , you never go wrong . oh yeah , it very comfortable . i wear these work long hours doesn't hurt even my glasses	1

i bought these speakers originally replacement pair weathered boston acoustics attached our overhead lattice back yard . these speakers very detailed i hear components music within tracks i would not expect able hear outdoors . said , bass extesion not great , but , given frequency range , i didn't expect it . i ended up reconditioning boston speakers also hooked these up . combination their bass extension ( must 40-50hz ) detailed polks extremely compelling , making outdoor listening surprisnigly good . even though one might pay more lower extension polks , it probably worth it if you like music . these good price , but limited . that not critisism , i knew this when i bought them ; i just hoping physics changed since last owner house bought bostons !	1

i've using this phone 2 years now ... fuming cheap nickel cadmium battery amount time well ! when i purchased it , this panasonic top-of-the-line phone . so naturally , i just assumed they used nickel hydride battery -like my last panasonic phone : kx-tg2550s . i didn't even notice battery right away . but when i finally got around opening up back handset , i * horrified * see nicd label ! since ' memory effect ' nickel cadmium batteries well known , using one something like cordless phone inexcusable ! this because it recharged frequently , usually never fully discharged -and unusable when it . [ ok , so you still use speakerphone base , gah ! might well just plug regular phone ! ] those haven't battery issues probably singing different tune after number months when nicd battery power output nosedives . since i've better battery performanace , there aint no going back ! there no other reason decision use such inferior technology , except save few bucks . or more likely , since panasonic replacement battery costs $20-25 , cash because they need replaced more often . [ absurd price because all battery consists -i took one apart- 3 aa size batteries ] fortunately , energizer now makes nickel hydride [ nimh ] replacement battery this phone , search amazon energizer er-p511	1

i bought tomtom go710 purely handsfree functionality ( which pretty bad ) ipod control . i viewed navigation part bonus . ipod control box pioneer bluetooth handsfree solution sony ericsson would cost me half not including installation . things looking good until i plugged ipod . it sounds like old turntable dusty record . i thought there something wrong so i contacted tomtom . they said it my windshield mount . they sent me new one . no help there . then they wanted it sent service . i . it took 5 weeks . no help there either . i am thinking it software fault operating system , or cpu unit just not up job . now second big let down . it doesn't charge ipod !!!!! so winter , if you forget bring your ipod car , it'll out juice very short time	-1

cd-rs much needed thing me . even if i still my music ipod , i still lot documents my computer . i definitely big enough hard drive store all my weird documents online-schooling such . but sometimes i go library or use different computer or so . i prefer using cd-rs rather than jumpdrive because they easy forget don't store very large amount -- which i believe it should price you paying those things . cd-rs less costly i don't need many , just few basically " just work " . these sony cd-rs just ! whenever i'm shopping cd-rs i look see what most inexpensive reliable brand . i most luck cd-rs sony , maxell , philips -- all three which decent manufacturers . tdk never seem burn speed they advertise . imation just seem coasters . memorex cd-rs paint always seem chip off just months after use . so i try searching those three brands . almost everytime sony always sale way below list price . i don't really need jewel cases either since i no desire keep my old documents -- least those date back months ago . jewel cases seem much more inexpensive when i don't buy them cd-rs . i suppose companies add them your cd-rs so you find them " value " . using sony cd-rs easy . i just like i any cd-r , burn my files through nero . i won't say these completely burn free , but even great maxell couple mess-ups every once awhile . but whether i'm burning music ( whatever reason since i now ipod ) or burning important documents , these cd-rs very trusty very little burn errors . maxell slightly more reliable than these , but price i can't see how you go wrong . these cd-rs also seem last fairly long me . i couple discs dating back early 2004 seeing some minor scratch top disc , but it certainly nothing unusable . some discs dating back then actually pretty good condition compared my tdk imaton discs . some reviewers complain data-loss after year or so after burning , but i yet notice this . all my cd-rs sony seem play fine any cd player i use my computer whatever age disc . bottom disc doesn't scratch easily other brands but collects fingerprints fairly well , which again why i like using jewel cases . also , cd-rs very clean-cut , meaning they lots room write . overall , these sony cd-rs work just fine me . they don't show many burn errors last good long time , plus sony name . they aren't quite good maxell cd-rs , but get job cheaper price . general , good " gets job without spending tons " cd-r . 4 stars	1

hdtv well packed worked just fine . picture fantastic over air hd stations , but not many true hd but merely digital low def ( most day ) . remote control very weak i rebuild it better performance . speakers put out such loud treble pops especially womens voices people cover their ears , so i reroute sound through headset jack my stereo . i could routed it differently through other rca jacks , but olevia their infinite wisdom made volume control not work such instance . i control ' headset ' volume remote however , though it dummied down nearly bass free sound . my last support letter olevia their abyssmal speakers received no reply . tv good value what it , but like any product , many shortcomings , tv stations even more it seems . they all abusing their hd bandwidth multiple copies 480i low def multicasting rarely use their bandwidth high definition . let hope us government demands they transmit least one hi def channel out their 5 or 6 broadcasting options . cable companies , beware , watch out missing dolby stereo jpg like image compression	1
great product , great price amazon ! i live malaysia , where local price 250% amazon list price . usd9$ ( shipment ) i it delivered singapore just few days , picked it up my friend place . first thing came out when i plugged it , my old monitor lived its useful life . althought colors still correct(able ) , overall luminosity so low i could only work dark room view full scale . i bought new lcd monitor , calibrated profiled it few minutes ( it wasn't quite right straight out box - too bright ) , now all my pictures come out beautifully ! i display 256 shades grey distinctively , which previously impossible . it not just photos , even dull windows interface suddenly comes life . highly recommended anyone dslr desire spend more than 5 minutes improving their pictures photoshop .	1

i've this lcd tv my house few weeks now i am very happy quality picture , size design . best way break this down into short review would list pros cons : pros : nice design ; wonderful picture hd signal dvds ; sturdy stand ; plenty inputscons : remote control terrible , shocks me panasonic would make such nice television then engineer remote just awful ; no pc inputbeing new new flat screen tvs i am little ignorant why/how analog signals fit this widescreen tv , but they picture doesn't seem stretched all . all all i am very happy this television don't miss my bulky cathode ray tube . this tv perfect bedroom , office or anywhere smaller tv used . only major downside atrocious remote control comes it , but that not enough take this down star . ***** highly recommende	1

i bought this keep up my college assignments work schedule . it isn't very useful because when you enter " " item day , it only show it you day . i either enter assignment every day which lot hassle or remember my 10 pg research paper due 12/5 ( isn't reason i bought it ? ) it could work people who tasks/appointments only require 1 day notice , but students who several long term projects , it waste money	-1
friend recently gave up his fathers old 78s which gems caruso spike jones . it quite find but who equipment play this stuff any more ?... who wants get up every 4 minutes turn it over ? well call me masochist but i decided give old treasures spin . i bought old thorens turntable ebay great sme tone arm . it plays all speeds including 16 rpm ... used sometimes braodcasters ... next thing i search cartridge . i surprised see good number available still made today . some quite expensive but i reasoned how much better could they justify price since old 78s rarely or never ! noise free . shure always made cartridges high quality good price range . so i chose m78s . it very compliant seems glide through grooves ease stability . it works very well my sme 3009 sii tonearm . results well worth modest cost cartridge . i would highly reccomend this cartridge anyone who wants give those oldies spin . you hear them better than ever !	1
this awesome scanner . compact , powerful , loaded features . easy use right out box . scans police frequencies , too ! crisp clear sound quality . this my 4th scanner i've ( i'm fire-medic)and it wonderful . but if you're so freaking inept you can't function without using computer find your front door or if you're so nieve you don't even know if your local pd scrambles their radio signals or if you think programming this unit more difficult than dialing cellphone or if you're so stuck yourself you can't miniature nascar logo your scanner ( which , way , every picture ever produce this unit ) , then this unit not one you ! ( i believe they still make play-doh . ) my guess your cousin your wife one same . but if you want quality product you'll happy you bought , this you . once you take it out box , just go [ ... ] click your state city you'll all frequencies you need . experiment different frequencies , well . enjoy	1
i love this mouse . small size makes it very easy pack into bag travel , also makes it easier me control . i've gone through many mice , this one my favorite so far . cord short , which good laptops , but would make it difficult use desktops	1

i looking small inexpensive pda ( windows pocket pc ) i would use reading books , playing few games , keep my contacts . there only few like available us . ipaq rx4200 just came out i decided give it try . my previous pda dell axim x3 . it smaller than most pdas , especially screen ( only 2.8 inches ) but it well build very comfortable hands . reading books rx4200 very comfortable ( i use haali reader - excellent free program reading books ) . screen bright - imho better quality then axim x3 - pda very comfortable hand , especially landscape mode . stylus good size , only issue it placed bottom left corner ( if you hold pda landscape mode ) it little difficult take out . overall i like it lot - due its size build quality . people who want play games it - there might issue - there no directional pad all this pda , so basically only games played it those stylus .	1

bought this device fell love it . screen great , audio excellent . it also bass boost which i think cool . only thing i found problem $40 extra software it need read mp4 . after putting my pictures it i noticed it kept freezing when i tried view them , but it because pictures too large . after changing size 1600x1200 it stopped gliching . far static i only notice it when i playback video i recorded , it so minute you won't really even notice it . i would probably change this 4 3/4 star	1
i picked up this guiatar because i interested playing electric well acoustic . first all guitar nice weight comes everything you need get started . if you don't know how tune guitar i suggest you buy electric tuner or search best method online tuning . guitar good sound it plays well right out box through amp . strings feel bit cheap , but if you get good cheap pair then would work well . overall money this good . especially if you buying it kid who wants it , but may out grow his desire play . guitars expensive long run good one set you back 500 - 1600 bucks . i'd get this see if you still interested it after set period time	1
so far no problems . western digital always one best hard disc manufacturers continues so . it working way it supposed . only reason i rate it 4 instead 5 ata drive always going better . otherwise , no complaints	1
while it appears i finally this switch mostly working , i say i'm very dissapointed it performance . iogear usb emulation keyboard mouse works very very poorly . keyboard mouse plugged into correct keyboard/mouse usb ports i would continually slow/stuck keyboard really poor mouse behaviour . i work around this plugging my keyboard/mouse into rear usb ports , thus bypassing keyboard emulation . this works although you wait all your usb devices re-enumerate every time you switch computers . while my mac powerbook works fine dvi switch , my pc quite often problems recognizing dvi monitor when switching back it . unplugging reconnecting lcd dvi connector into switch seems bring it back life . no idea where problem , but i dell 2001fp monitor , windows xp sp2 ati radeon 9800 ( everything running latest drivers/firmware ) . how iogear could shipped product this broken beyond me . unless they release firmware update fixes these problems i only recommend people stay well away this product	-1

nice solid construction . clever way folding up compactly so it same size my visor edge . i found two minor problems using it . until you get used it , attaching my pda keyboard tricky . this probably due way handspring designed connector not fault targus . other problem i most time when i connect keyboard my pda keyboard won't work unless i detach it , disable keyboard keyboard program , reattach keyboard , reattach keyboard , then reenable keyboard software . some experimentation i found if i just disable keyboard software before detaching keyboard , i didn't this problem . drawback remembering disable before detachment , enabling after attachment . aside these two minor problems , i still regard this excellent product	1

i bought different case first it wasn't what i wanted so instead i bought this one , contour design . i really like clear hard case large opening bottom where headphones go , i bought dlo one i open case recharge ipod which i find annoying . i also couldn't fit myh headphones because case too think , so this design works well me . i open close case number times before putting ipod still i can't get out ipod , i just stopped trying , im sure if i need ill able but design such it isn't really necessary . just sure you ready put it before you so . i think clip okay , it would nice if it could attached both ways , but im glad if it only one way they put it such you see screen . i like my case , i now slip nano my pocket not worry any scratches , etc	1

i only ever owned color ink jet printers such epson brother , but i must say , laser printing , hp takes cake . i own hp laserjet 4 plus ( monochrome b/w ) it worked great me 6 years plus . this new machine definitely major improvement . first off , it very easy set up you choose whether it run off usb port , or you network it through your system . i personally it connected my wireless d-link router i 2 windows pcs , 1 toshiba wireless laptop , 2 wireless macs networked all them able pick up hp provided hp software disk all able print it . it also prints so fast remarkably quiet . it monster machine size ( prepared nice big space it , both heighth , width length - it ( wxlxh ) 18.00 " 16.00 " 15.00 " but remember , you need room feed front it , you need room wires back ) . it takes 4 different cartridges ( cyan , magenta , yellow black - cmyk ) so this costly . cartridges run $80 each , so it costs $320 replace all them , however , they last whopping 2500 pages each color . it would take 5 ink cartridges each color last long . when toner low , you get warning . you even view printer network any connected computer see exactly how many pages left each cartridge ( based averages ) . bad : i'll try not leave bad comment this final thing say , however , it quite lousy paper feeder . i may doing something wrong , but i've found you only print one piece paper time . sometimes i print out lot stuff one-side paper , then , when i'm looking it , i turn paper over , place those manual feeder , then use paper again more printing other blank side . you can't really this . far printing business cards , or cardstock , it not best . you can't simply lay paper tray then printer print it . you insert paper special way , wait printer " suck " paper , then once it it , it able print . it print generic avery labels okay though . all all , it great . oh , there one astounding point i forgot make : it prints both sides without change paper around or anything , called duplexing ( sorry , i didn't know these terms before ) . example , i 14-page document print out , so i just went ' finishing ' tab selected ' print both sides ' wahlah , it printed 7 pieces paper , two-sided absolutely flawlessly , without touch or insert anything . i eventually printed 200 double-sided brochures shiny color magazine type paper , printing perfect . if you don't need this printer network , you don't need duplex ( double-sided ) printing , get much cheaper hp 1600 color laser . otherwise , color laser printer under $500 able networked duplex among other things , it really great deal all around , thus , it gets 4 stars . i deduct one star bad paper feeder , but aside , it superb . get yours now - cartridges already it full-sized ( not sample cartridges ) , so it ready go . you may need network cable , but it come usb 2.0 cable just case you don't one . enjoy thank you reading	1
i purchased this radio primarily shortwave use week ago radioshack $50 , it my first . other reviews consistent its performance am/fm bands - strong impressive . shortwave reception also good , but there limitations which may or may not reflect radio itself . it important read introduction shortwave featured instruction booklet , so you know where start . here some other lessons learned . i just returned business trip outside boston , where i unable tune any shortwave signals my hotel room second floor near window . i listening night tried all 7 bands . home , i only able tune two stations sw1 , also during night time period . this disappointing . however , last night i hit paydirt . i took radio bedroom , second floor our house , found many stations several bands . addition number us stations , i heard stations western europe , cuba , what i think korean station , also what sounded like russian or some eastern european language . since our neighborhood consists closely spaced houses , i guess i should not surprised poor first-floor performance . not sure what problem near boston . i like volume dial one side radio , tuning dial other . way , you scan different frequencies , you adjust volume background noise increases or fades . one thing i noticed digital display displays 0.5 incremental changes frequency , but i think it tunes more finely than this . i might hit . 5 mark , tune ever so slightly , hear something different even though digital readout not change . since it analog tuner , i suppose this makes sense . unfortunately , i already grown impatient radio before first positive experience described above . haste , i decided get different radio instead , just ordered kaito ka1103 . those considering several models , i digress share results search portable sw radio good sensitivity until $150 ( street prices ) . reviews radios found eham.net under " reviews " " receivers general " there select reviews other sites such radiointel.com . top contenders $80-$150 category ( street prices ) sony 7600 , sangean ats909 , grundig yb400 , kaito ka1103 . grundig s350 also popular , but i saw one radioshack it quite large . i read every review i could find , narrowed choices kaito sony based performance considerations . then i phoned universal-radio.com after talking sales person , settled kaito $90 ( they sell both finalist models ) . sony may slight edge holding signal , reportedly built like tank , but kaito significantly cheaper (...) . addition , kaito comes charger , rechargeable batteries , external antenna . sony features none these . univeral radio told me charge sony offer extra money junk , they sold there own custom built units . radio made shortlist kaito ka1101 . several reviewers commented they really liked model . (...) i also learned recently there book called passport world band radio considered indispensible learning what sw stations out there where when find them broadcasting . they also lots radio reviews . (...) . here some links you might want check out : reviews http://www.eham.net/reviews/products/8http://www.radiointel.com/reviews.htm (...) if you strapped cash , also consider grundig fr200 fr300 (...) . both offer am/fm . fr200 offers sw1 sw2 fr300 offers weather bands . tuners analog function well . these considered ' emergency radios ' such offer other things . addition radio functions , they charged using attached hand crank ( or run aa batteries ) . hand crank charge cells phones ( multiple adaptors included ) . fr200 white led flash light , red led flasher , siren , also weather alert . latter interesting . you radio silent , but set ' alert ' setting . if weather alert sent national weather service , radio beep . kind cool . however , we found they issue these alerts 1-2 times week , response what many people would not consider real emergency ( wind gusts up 25 mph emergency ? ) so , i turn off alert function unless i know there possibility serious weather conditions	1

i just received this tv today simply amazed . my opinion there four things make this excellent buy : 1 . easy setup . tv comes factory mounted stand . cable hook ups well located easy get . 2 . auto language channel set up . when you first turn tv , it prompts you your choice language . then it automatically selects all your cable channels . 3 . remote very high quality , not like other manufacterers who supply cheap remotes their sets . 4 . picture quality . right out box , picture amazing . bright colors , excellent blacks , very sharp picture ( this without using hd ) . almost unlimited viewing angles too ! i seen or bought several lcd tv , without question , this best bunch . i would definitely recommend this tv	1

i've my pepper pad 3 three weeks now am loving it ... i use it every morning read paper , fact i've cancelled my daily paper subscriptions because i prefer read news my pad ( change nearly covers cost pad ) . scroll wheel makes it super easy read even extended articles , i follow up any article . kitchen , it become my main recipe book . web hand 3 seconds , i'm never short ideas advice . splash-resistant design seems work well . i've not so careful keep it out harms way still . even after i've spilled water it , dropped it counter , bumped what not , pad still works great . my favorite use pad so far , though , play go ( game somewhat similar chess ) . i lay down couch tap screen play against players around world . it far best device playing on-line board games i've found . yes , there some bugs , but i've found software recovers gracefully what i'm doing , it not caused any real problems . i wouldn't use pad my work pc , but then again , i wouldn't use my work pc kitchen counter top . i'd highly recommend pepper pad 3 ( plus home wifi network ) anyone who wants web everywhere without computers all over house	1

all who interested mz-rh1 , i recently this item purchased japan silver . black model same , some ways better only due manual english . machine itself , there clear definition per sony maturity its years since inception minidisc . after purchasing 10th anniversary n10 model , then it stolen , i hesitant purchasing model fear there update better . mz-rh1 , i no fear this model define sound reputation minidisc rest its years . it clearly lit oled screen side player simply brilliant , conserving battery life while displaying necessary functions player . one downside lack group button . those familiar minidisc know sonicstage stores your music groups , pressing group button skip groups so you find album you looking . this missing player itself , but it handily found remote those who choose use it . those us who really take our sound quality seriously , this player/recorder most clear balanced sound i ever heard any minidisc , quite arguably any recorder . sony not hesitant create this model portable recording studio . i am impressed sound , which rivals compact disc quality , it levels line out never distort . not mention new version sonic stage much more user-friendly than before , compability apple's; finally ! i now record my brother dj mixes into my mz-rh1 , then copy into sonic stage , burn cd ( files recorded hi-md discs saved sonic stage wav . files ) , then share friends . it quite simply portable recording studio . thank you sony creating music recorder finally satisfy your demanding customers .	1

i thought lack querty keyboard would slow me down . it didn't . this excellent labeler only $20 . i figured out how make labels different fonts , boxes , 2 lines , etc ., 5 minutes , without reading manual . only small wish i might ask higher resolution print like brother labeler . my wife uses one . however , labels split backing really makes this labeler superior me . brother doesn't split backing i've spent two or three minutes per label trying peel back off brother labels . my son likes dymo alligator box outline . i like big fonts option . i'm off label some stuff probably doesn't need label , but i new toy	1
it work only until one year which there warranty after it all depends your luck . mine stopped working 14th month , took it local repair shop , low quality unavailable parts , so repair not possible except syntax . they ask arm leg fix it top shipping this heavy junk , you better off buying well known brand extended warranty	-1
this television hasn't worked right since i got it , support not so great . i simply cannot get it display full screen . comcast doesn't carry id# which makes setup complete guesswork . i really might well bought good 32 inch set . well , i get advantage taller screen 4:3 aspect , which nice . picture quality fine . i seen reviews clunky remote , but i don't any problems how it looks or feels . you aim it pretty close bottom set . right now i wish i spent $600	-1
this thing plays everything . it plays various formats mp3 , wma , wav , just name few . comes car kit so you play it through your car stereo tape player . doesn't sound right adapter came it though . ( sounds muffled through right speakers but good left speakers ) . if you record songs your computer use highest bitrate possible , it sound more clear when listening headphones . it comes other accessories like adapter plug cigarette lighter jack , ear-bud earphones , hardwire remote plugs into cd walkman play , pause , stop , rewind , fast forward through song tracks when using car adapter your car	1
i concerned keeping my new toy safe elements . this product fits performs perfectly . i am impressed fact it thin you really cant see it your mac book . i also like fact i put stickers other stuff my new laptop . reason i bought this product because i wanted some more structure my screen . i laptops before one screen break opening it up . i thought this product would give lcd more stiffness so far nothing broke . this product worth investment	1
this not range it states it . i even called their customer service person asked this agreed me . maybe useful people city near tower , other wise it pretty useless	-1
instructions vague hard understand because this machine china . after using machine few months , i got hang it use it little differently than instructions suggest . i get fantastic results using white pads 90% time . yellow pads only used if discs completely thrashed . liquid polish best stuff use . i also use creams white pads if disc very scratchy . i sell dvd/cd living this machine greatly improved my sales prices . must all sellers dvd/cd/games . it pay itself !	1

just recently purchased this amazon , few hiccups shipping but these things happen , since price online great shipping free it doesn't hurt bad overlook mishap . it hard begin praise quality sound picture your going get amount money you pay this htib ( home theater box ) system . i am far no expert but i worked car audio industry 5 years now few friends expensive surround systems so i know difference quality sound , decent sound bad sound . there noticable difference quality this high end stuff which expected , but price your paying this sony system can't beat . set up breeze connecting everything very easy . sound crisp clear . i got my 42 lcd tv few weeks before this while i watching movies off xbox360 . picture great but sound really didn't add up . this system provided sound level quality equal picture . there few times when i jumped up while loungin couch cause sound so real . also if your gamer pick up optical cable 360 run it through this system it broadcast games 5.1 digital which change your life . if your gamer digital cable , you'll need pick up digital coaxial cable well otherwise you'll switch optical 360 cable if you want watch cable 5.1 picture wise dvds look great , i tell noticable difference quality upscaling vs watching dvd reg . player . bear mind it not going look like hd dvd or blu ray movie but its pretty close should satisfy most people . now addressing some critics out there . it load really slow it hard keeping track discs . my point why would you 5 dvds loaded first place you only watch one movie time , unless your marathoning sopranos or sergio leone movie night there no need . i've keeping slots one two open dvd leaving other 3 music which seems divide things up makes it more easy keep track things . sub way loud . i'm amazed sony didn't put control knob sub box , my previous cheaper phillips system well my computer speakers . this reason why its not five star system . contrary other claims you adjust sub . you go setup menu customize setup ( this after you auto cal . ) sound quality music isn't greatest , cds sound pretty good but if you hook laptop up digital music volume pretty low . when its all said , quality you get this system well beyond price tag . it few kinks doesn't sound like ultra high end system , but you really don't need something like your house unless you huge home theater room anyway . styling this system retro pretty cool speakers look great , picture sound awesome	1
i use it computer monitor , playing xbox , watching digital cable . it well worth its price highly recommend it anyone . excellent picture quality . only one problem ; one four holes used mounting tv wall stripped out very easily . makes you weary just thinking putting it up . if you , buy original manufacturer mount instead aftermarket .	1
very effective , soothing helpful back ache sciatica . great value	1
this dock waste me . it came home av pack . i wanted durable zune case would look good protect screen same time . toughskin case all three exactly what i looking protection . only down side toughskin case zune not fit this docking station while it case . i believe engineering problem docking station . this not bulky case , it fits zune perfectly , however , even removing insert docking station , zune not fit dock while case . why they didn't make docking station would accommodate zune fitted case , makes no sense . no one going want take trouble removing case each time they dock their zune . they should take these docking stations back customers who feel i replace them their expense something works ! toughskin case , i highly recommend it ; other cases just didn't seem offer this quality protection while also nice professional appearance .	-1
i read many reviews many customers variety headphones . i leary hi low-end products . i sought mid-range . its kinda unknown territory this on-line purchasing unseen , untested merchandise . i read some pretty good reviews this v-moda line . when product finally arrived i listened , well say i amazed would understatement . i love sound these earbuds produce . they amazing . i am very pleased sound quality highs especially bass - wow !. audio cable little thin , so careful them . earbuds stay my ear very well . i use adapters earbuds out box . noise cancelling feature outstanding . i work industrial environment very loud machines i think these work better than my ear plugs . music makes work more tolerable . i would highly recommend this product anyone everyone . enjoy them i . thanks reading my review	1

microphone works great . sound produced noticeable difference compared internal mic ( course ) . it makes video sound so much more professional . ps : visualdude- sounds like you didn't research what you buying . all interference incorrect specifications .	1
works feels just like laptop keyboard touchpad mouse . while touchpad little imprecise and/or touchy , it no more so than what you would find laptop . i use it conjunction my home theater pc which displays big screen tv , it works great set up . i give it only four stars due its high cost given its lack advanced features or technology . i mention i somewhat concerned confused when i received product box stated " mini keyboard " . you read elsewhere , there " mini " model many people trouble . after contacting amazon what i thought shipping mistake ( receiving identical item when quickly re-shipped ) i determined comparing model numbers dimensions adesso site i received correct model spite confusing " mini " designation box . all all , quite satisfied product amazon customer service , what essentially non-issue .	1
gaming , steelsound 5h usb v2 best i used date . they comfortable , cover entire ear ( but don't give you headache like other full-ear headsets ) , sound great ... after adjusting equalizer bit . straight out box , games sounded extremely " tinny " , microphone had/has very annoying high pitched noise sounds like electronic interference . after checking friends who also use this headset , after bypassing usb dongle , you see microphones poor quality comes usb attachment . after teammates ventrilo complain annoying feedback noise , i spent hour adjusting microphones volume usb soundcard drivers , ventrilo . those you also this problem , raise your microphones volume soundcard control , lower your volume ventrilo / teamspeak / whatever you use . even after tweaking it , there still buzz , but i'm told it isn't annoying . if it weren't , this headset would get 5 stars , but poor quality microphone input usb device drags it down bit . aside , amazing sound after you go mess equalizer . music , games , sound great	1

recent review i read pc magazine where they felt atracformat noisy , not case . disk i started ( using atrac ) sounds roughly good some disks i dubbed using md deck some time earlier . hence my decision go this technology opposed flash ram or hard drive based devices since i already md library . it sounds pretty good , not great it portable device my ears pretty good such things . i hope it lasts while because looks like sony getting ready bail md format i don't want return make any more sony electronics ( non-media ) purchases . don't get me started rootkit nonsense because i believe music execs all deserve jail creating new conduit spyware	1
after purchasing several other cordless phones not able hear clearly any them i finally hit winner this one . sound quality superb . my only complaints 1 ) both extensions cannot used same time ( security feature ? ) , 2 ) no hold or mute buttons . given sound quality far most important virtue i place telephone i would purchase this telephone again or without hold/mute buttons . later note : thanks reviewer i now know phone permit two-handsets used same time , muting , putting call hold . although none these functions intuitive , they available . thanks very much setting me straight	1

i bought this scanner when my old faithful mustek gave up ghost . i like this one because it sleek turned it side if space problem . i also like it button functions , since it makes it very easy someone like my mother , who just basic computer user , scan . sometimes she make copy something instead getting her car going staples pay nickel copy , she now put it scanner glass push " copy " button . not speediest way make copy , but still faster than driving copy center . anyway , one reasons i bought this particular scanner negative/slide scanning . i pretty disappointed , like previous reviewer , find it not easily slide copies , yet functionality so . ( you scan positive transparancies ) . attachment filmstrips bulky , but easily attached , it wants you actual 35mm film strip . this problem if you only partial strips or non-35mm strips . however , i am happy say little manipulation , you actually all above plus slides . however , doing slides means you probably never again show them projector . you must remove slide it mat place it glass inside filmstrip attachment then scan positive . same goes partial strips non-35mm . scanning software actually each frame individually , so it doesnt matter if you only one shot or strip 6 . if you not intending sit down your whole slide or negative collection one sitting , you fine this . however , if your main intent slides easiest possible way , you should investigate other scanners	1
who doesn't love music their shower ? i originally purchased much pricier player sharper image , which stopped playing within first month . luckily , still under warranty , i got replacement . this one stopped after four months ... no longer under 90 day warranty . so then i research this one one . i love it . it much more compact than tsi model , significantly sturdier , hangs anywhere your shower well free stands unobtrusively anywhere else , less expensive , easy use program , latching door you know keeps water out . just all around nicely designed , user friendly cd player	1

sure protection your laptop . if you transport your laptop then you want protection this case provides . well worth investment	1
