this probably my favorite mug . it easily holds twice much regular coffee cup . it comes plastic splash guard locks into place down inside rim . best thing mug though wide grippy bottom enables me set it just anywhere my car without worrying it tip over . even hard corners don't seem phase it . it also only cup my house withstand my cat efforts tip it over . odd shape also downsides though . it won't fit any cup holder i've ever come across , but doesn't matter much since it won't tip over no matter where you set it . if you don't rinse it out immediately , it difficult clean later , due shape ; if you don't small hands , you may need bottle cleaning brush . also , i imagine if you more than one these mugs , they'd awkward store since this mug tends hog cabinet space . despite this , it still great mug . fact i'm going need since my husband now adopted it his favorite too	1

i'd looking good juicer number months , but shied away because they're expensive . i saw this deal , read analyzed reviews , rolled dice . it arrived yesterday , after easily disassembling it wash parts get know it initially , i ran half dozen carrots through it . omg !! fast delicious carrot juice my own kitchen ! clean-up easy ( well , i old pro now ) quick -- under five minutes . address some negatives you may read , first , size : course it big . they're all big bulky . it their nature . second , residue : my carrot pulp dry . i suppose if i'd put it floor stood it i might gotten maybe teaspoon carrot juice out it . third , it factory reconditioned : me , that plus . consider this : manufacturer rolls out tens thousands these off line , each one eye-balled polished qc before bagging boxing , assuming they all good go . but , factory re-con gone over top bottem , inside out before it released . no assumptions -- last thing manufacturer wants see thing back again , so you know they'll make sure they don't . if it'd returned little cosmetic blem , i certainly live considering discount i'm getting . i'm still not sure why they're virtually giving these away , but waring old trusted brand , juicer not cheaply made . i'll back year ( hopefully not sooner ) give some time perspective this review . soon i finish writing this , i'm ordering two more christmas gifts .	1
somewhat insomniac i read well into hours night book light essential me . i therefore purchased itty bitty booklight . if you use this light it essential purchase power supply two reasons . firstly , there no auto shut-off so if you fall asleep reading your batteries wear down very quickly . secondly , when using batteries , they start dimming rather quickly making it hard eyes difficult read resulting constant need new batteries . this light also extremely fragile . over couple years i went through 7 these ! i would not recommend this light - amount you spend never-ending purchasing batteries or expensive power supply , constant new purchases after it breaks , you might well splurge buy decent book light . i now tri lite capstone enterprises ( available barnes nobel - come get it stock amazon ! ) it terrific ! it clock alarm timer . you set it stay any period time once it reaches time light flashes . time you extend minutes . if you don't so , example you're sleeping , it automatically shut off . it also produces much more light much brighter than itty bitty book light	1
i love bought one my parents well my laws .... great my morning tea . favorite feature auto shut off , i flip switch , get ready work water ready pour . i don't worry running kettle once water boiled . i highly recommend this product	1
easy use , easy clean . two major requirements kitchen appliance me happy . this thing easier clean than my old george foreman grill ( me pain neck ) . only time it little messy when you change oil , which i every 2 3 weeks depending how much i've used it what i've cooked . if i'm doing just veggies , i keep oil . if i meat or seafood , i'll change oil right after . very pleased overall .	1

i'm absolutely thilled this waring ! it definitely changed my opinion juicers . i purchased reconditioned model . it arrived factory ( re ? )-packaged looked brand new . not single mark it , not even fingerprint ! it far easier clean , obviously superior design : parts clean up like new dishwasher . components fit perfectly , despite probably couple hundred uses . it exponentially faster , remainders noticeably dryer . ( reviewer mentioned , this refuse obviously indicates very efficient juicer ! ) looks , sounds functions like very upscale appliance . no spraying , no movement , no juicer " drama " ! :-) absolutely best one i've owned after lots uses , it still going strong it when it arrived .	1

my three year old med-length hair tortiseshell cat adores this brush . she gets persistent dandruff furballs but won't let me touch her any other brush . i tried every kind brush but she hates groomed ! so imagine my surprise when i pull this brush out package she actually lays down me groom her after few strokes ! only downsides this product : 1 . small size - it doesn't hold much fur so either all fur ends up floor or you emptying it every few strokes2 . " front " versus " back " positions - cats not generally stay one place , i three they roll walk around while i groom them . it bit unconvenient constantly switch brush my left right hand get proper angle de-shed my kitties . i don't know how this could improved but it downside product . overall it defineitely worth 10 bucks i spent , my boo-boo never lets me groom her anything else	1
i owned one these little wonders over five years . during time i replaced lightbulb one time , which extent maintenance or repairs light required . people who complaining light feels " flimsy " , you tried tightening series screws allow you adjust tension various parts light ? it designed allow this sort adjustment , but if you never tighten screws they eventually get loose . imagine ! it moving part ! seriously , maybe they've switched different supplier ( although i doubt it ) , but my light joy . it proven durable over countless trips , moves , drops . it provides excellent illumination yet allows your spouse sleep undisturbed beside you . plus , unlike so many designs market , it very lightweight . some designs inexplicably batteries housed unit , so batteries weigh down your book while you read . i just don't understand all negative reviews this product . only thing i suggest : try tightening those screws periodically . it make world difference	1
this kettle amazing . it simple -- you plug it flip switch ( light turns let you know it working ) . it heats very quickly , lt ; 5 minutes full kettle boiling water if you only want cup or two tea , it heats 3 . students dorms , you use it oatmeal , soup , tea . automatically cuts off after boiling minute , so no worries fire hazards . great product , i use it every day .	1

hb 31602 excellent raclette grill price well below most other raclettes market now . this my second grill ; first - swiss-made machine - died after 10 years use . i decided try hb because its features attractive price , well my previous favorable experience amazon event i wanted return item . short , unit functions perfectly . its variable temperature control ( must raclette cooking ) its job well . clean up - frequent gripe among raclette grill reviewers - breeze .... assuming you only use top grill cook normal raclette-type foods such small potatoes , sausages or canadian bacon , not frying eggs , you treat non-stick surface properly . although listing copy doesn't make this clear , unit comes both rectangular pans plastic scrapers . cord length ( often-heard complaint ) quite adequate . only potential shortcoming way item shipped -- its retail box only , way you would pick it up store . means only thing your grill rough world ups trip few pieces egg-carton packing flimsy , non-corrugated box .... recipe disaster . fortunately , my unit arrived ok though box pretty beat up . amazon should require its third party ' partners ' use shipping cartons , like amazon itself always . ( positive side , my one experience amazon re shipping-damaged item very satisfactory .	1
i've my h-b step savor skillet/griddle several months now , i am very happy it . griddle accomodates four medium-sized pancakes , small lip around edge keeps batter off my countertops . skillet gets hot enough brown hamburger meat enough capacity prepare substantial main dish family 4-6 . temperature control temperature markings both griddle skillet , since skillet temperature runs lower than griddle . clean-up easier than traditional electric skillets . you don't need worry immersing electrical components because skillet lifts off base ( which griddle ) washed like any non-stick cookware . griddle wipes clean paper towel or damp sponge . though i'm not much home entertaining , i imagine this electric skillet very handy -- you cook it , then turn temperature down keep food warm long you need . lid adjustable vent it control moisture level inside . i only wish non-stick coating bit tougher . i've careful avoid scratches so far , but i know it only matter time . i just hope h-b keeps making these clever kitchen tools , because when this one becomes unusable , i'll certainly buy one	1
i purchased this item based other reviews i am not sorry i made purchase several reasons . i love lodge cast iron , amazon best prices anywhere free shipping . however , i taken aback size this skillet . it huge ! i tried it my gas range it takes up front back burners but adjustments needed keep sides burning . if it used just front burner ( larger burner ) flame directed middle pan but there so much skillet left over outer edges never get really hot . i would think 13inch skillet ( which i just purchased also ) would make more reasonable purchase becuase it 12 which might too small 15 1/4 which toooooo big	1

we just purchased reconditioned dyson dc 14 so far it works pretty well : 1 . noise level solid " ok " . 2 . suction decent . 3 . it built-in rotating spiral brush automatically brushes rug when vacuum turned . you option turn it off when you clean hard wood floors . 4 . it no bag filter which plus . collected dirt easily removed container one press button . 5 . you option clean stairs very flexible attached cleaning hose extended . 6 . unfortunately reconditioned version comes only 6 month limited warranty . 7 . it bit bulky but forgiveable . 8 . weight vacuum could lighter . 9 . price reasonable i assume compared original retail price approx . $550 . overall out 5 star rating i would rate dc14 ( reconditioned ) towards 4 .	1

i work assisted living facility we use fiestaware alzheimer area . these dinner plates great because you room main dish two side dishes well dinner roll . used alzheimer area , these plates occassionally abused . i seen accidently dropped i seem purposely pushed off table . either case , plate didn't break . though they little pricey ( we even get deal because we buy large quantities ) , they worth it . ours seem last forever . they get used all 3 meals , plus snacks . , if we need it , these plates double mini serving platters	1

what i say ? it lives up its hype : it covers 1 stick butter fits into my decor .	1

this worst vacuum we ever . it doesn't pick up pet hair - what heck ? it doesn't bare floors , it sucks up chews up persian rugs , it self propelled ? you got kidding me ! i push this thing harder than any vacuum ever . i went wal mart lowes get new belt it , this 4th belt we gone through one year neither places it . now what ? it very heavy vacuum . bringing it upstairs nearly kills ya . it far loudest vacuum there , super loud droning sound sends animals wild each time you turn it . small room it absolutely deafening ! i hate it , i not recommend it . if someone here - they lying you ! this worst vacuum we owned . i visibly see dust dirt shoot out back when i vacuum ( even after cleaning it out ) so much hepa filter!!!don't buy this vacuum , you want throw it through window like i even my husband wants !!	-1
this probably sturdiest bottle opener i've ever used . it opens pretty much any bottle ease , leverage easy due its bulk size . you probably won't ever lose it , either , since it so big . it definitely not travel because its weight , so you'll want something else if you plan bring bottle opener picnics or camping trips	1
server italian restaurant , i open plethora wine bottles front customers . based experience many different corkscrews , this far easiest use . it one fastest smoothest any corkscrew i experienced . i , however , seen it other places much cheaper than here	1
my husband wanted something take his coffee work . after doing some research seeing ratings this item received amazon i gave it him christmas . he absolutely loves it . one morning he filled it up hot water so it could later ready coffee he forgot all it . when i getting ready dishes 6pm i poured out water it still steaming hot . i highly recommend this anyone . we not any leaking problems like some other reviewers .	1
i some research pans because i wanted some christmas replace old ones . i 10 inch skillet , 4.5 quart sauce 5 quart oval pans they best pans i've ever owned . what i love them ? 1 . mine not any sticking issues what so ever . 2 . they clean extremely easy fast via hand washing ( no hard scrubbing all ) . 3 . since it only takes seconds clean , i reuse cook something else without any flavor previous meal . 4 . handles not get hot they good non-slip grip ( i silicone rubber handles ) . 5 . they apparently put oven up 350 degrees but i not tried yet . 6 . they not heavy some professional ones . i would recommend buying this brand . conif i say anything bad them , only thing i think rivets inside pan attach handle pan get food stuck around them so you really clean around area good . i wish they would just attached handle outside pan	1
this not only peppermill i own , but it only one i'll use . i hate admit it , but i walked into dining room retrieve this baby even though perfectly usable mill right kitchen cupboad front me . i not intend become such peppermill snob but this such well designed tool i no longer settle using old ones . all previous mill suffered similar problems which oxo solved . maryland , humidity always problem peppermills . not this one . through dog days august , when other mills just mashing peppers into gummy paste clogging point where you gladly settle year old ground pepper , this mill produces talc fine powder . i've read other people trouble getting fine grind . you cannot just crank down adjustment nut get fine grind . your turn crank counter clockwise you tighten adjuster . this helps clear mechanism . if you don't this , larger peppercorns block mechanism closing down all way . once you get hang how adjust this mill , it provide copiuous quantities pepper extra cource super fine . easy grip handle eliminates all wasted motion associated tradional mill . i make my own barbeque rub always hated grinding enough pepper recipe . most mills only grind correctly one direction . so , you twist knob , release it reposition your grip twist again . half your motion wasted . now , thanks easy grip handle i crank out tablespoons pepper seconds . when i'm , i set mill back it clip-on base so there no pepper dust my spice cabinet . if you believe form follows function , this beautiful tool . if you need more status you peppermill get solid walnut mill or brushed aluminum mill manufacturer . just don't expect it out perform this classic .	1

this toaster definitely space saver . there few things you need know get great food out it though , toast i turn oven before i get bread out so it good temp when i put slices . if you want bake something or toast baguette sandwich just use bottom burner . i like how shelves come out when you open door , it makes retrieving your food so much easier . all all , it takes few tries adjust this toaster oven , but it makes up initial awkward period so cute small . i'm very happy my purchase .	1
if you're all clad chef , you know quality . accept no substitute splatter screen . i tired wiping up grease splatters all over my stovetop , around dials , floor , etc ... cheap flat screens just don't stay pan . edges all clad screen make it foolproof staying place . handle design saves space storage . one size fits everything up 13 inches . screen high quality design , not window screen gets punctured sooner or later . i tell this screen never bend out shape either . yes , it more expensive than cheap flat ones , but you'll appreciate performance durability advantages	1
it hard believe - but it not open cans . seriously . christmas morning food preps well underway we discovered our brand new opener would not open cans . unbeliveable !	-1
definitely focuses flavor aroma finest hermitage , shiraz , etc ...... but glasses not feel delicate , refined my other sommelier series . maybe because they hand made ? i compared ones i bought amazon set local store . glasses store felt lighter . otherwise , glasses excellent ! go figure ? oh , there small bubble one glasses . not distraction after filled wine , but .............. $60.00 glass !!	1

i purchased this diamond sharpening steel amazon used it couple days . it really works superb overall performance above all expectations . it not only realigns edge but sharpens it well . i.e. it removes material ( steel ) infinitesimal amount accumulates surface tool extremely fine dust . it takes only few effortless strokes simple edge realignment if knife sharp or few minutes work if knife dull . but any case , result amazing ! once while this diamond sharpening steel should put under running water only few seconds cleaning steel dust residue flushes water . maintenance simple easy . so , whether you cheap knives or expensive ones this tool worth money . only issue i leave open durability this diamond sharpening steel . theoretically it should last forever but reality it remains seen .	1

i bought this little thing 1 week ago , amazed . it works great , comes spare props , one slickest little toys i've ever seen . it lasts 5 minutes charge , takes 10 minutes charge . headlight flashes when batteries dying warn you , but sub floats automatically , it not really necessary . its two motors make it very maneuverable , although little tricky forward causes sub dive , reverse raises it . fish my pond aquarium mildly curious , mildly annoyed sub . so far , it fairly rugged , withstanding frequent use me my 10 year old sub . hard beat this price	1

perhaps like you , i love silicone . this large spatula quite nice . you anything silicone . you fry , poach , make soups , there never worry heat . le crueset makes fine quality silicone utensils , but their wood unfinished , so unless you keep them oiled , they age spilter . these you remove top if you like but wooden handles treated , water resistant . addition these made long hall , their shape unique . i like shape slightly angled , this makes it easier run edges bowl . i so happy my purchase these ! i can't say enough good things them . i would recommend these over other manufactors , they better made , improve others weaker areas . must your kitchen	1

poor folks who complaining " eee " display , i haven't same problems . customer support this really professional prompt 800 number . " eee " problem result people not reading instructions not immersing control panel water . don't it . panel electronic electronics don't work when they're filled water . this unit good , solid fryer which i've no problems . pros : easy use , easy clean up . nothing baked my frier or my friends friers ( death eee ) . even when frying " trouble " items like pastry or breaded items , basket comes clean easilly . controls positive engagement hard accidentally push . unit makes loud beeping when buttons pushed distinctive alarm . you shouldn't leave frier unattended , but you enough peace-of-mind you work other things kitchen while fryer working . bonus suggested cooking tempetures printed right unit so when manual gets lost , you some idea what what . window also lifesaver it lets you see what oil doing just case anything goes wrong . cons : power chord most annoying bit plugged upside down . don't it . it says " this side up " clearly chord , but if you absent minded or limited eyesight , this might issue . only other problem controls ( power button ) faces frying basket . this more pet-peeve then anything but if you need get control unit hurry , you not want reaching through hot oil splatter . my suggestion : keep it it own power strip so you yet button case emergency . sadly , this gripe applies almost all friers . i also wish lid bit better designed , lid drops inevitable condensation water into oil until you get used tipping it out ( towards basket handle ) . once you get hang it , condensation dropping into oil avoided . this frier , despite few minor shortcomings , excellent . one nice features it heats up quickly maintain heat even when adding pulling out food . caution when oil disagreeable , it heats up quickly . sure supervise frier . i managed boneheaded thing chopping up mushrooms , washing them , tossing them without thinking it managed cause quite show kitchen . i actually read manual , there blurb there make sure food completely thawed dried which i not heed . if you respect power here , it great unit	1

i bought this item through target via amazon . similar other recent purchasers , i problems motor/base not working all , notified target replacement . however , i same problem replacement unit , after some fiddling around , able get new unit working . trick seems " gears " connect bottom bowl top motor/base . they need " just so " motor turn . must some kind safety feature . since figuring this out , machine worked great . fairly quiet operation relatively simple clean up ( bowl attachments go directly dishwasher ) . i would give it 5 stars except frustrating front end work - it shouldn't complicated ! very least , directions should warn proper assembling needed machine turn	1

riedel o series wine tumblers great value more practical many occasions than traditional wine glasses because they lack potentially fragile stem . these pinot noir/nebbiolo glasses great not only those two varietals , but also beaujolais other wines made gamay grape . i also happen think these could work " general purpose " red wine glasses , if you should so choose use them such . these great all but most formal occasions , should really enhance your wine tasting experience , whether you wine novice or expert taster .	1

my wife i drink more coffee than we probably should . this cuisinart coffee maker brews full pot just few minutes . it taste great . i really like how easy it take everything apart place parts my dishwasher . coffee pot not spill water all over place when filling machine like so many other brands i've experienced past . although i rated this coffee maker 5-star , there one little thing i don't care much . machine stays 2-hours before auto shut-off shuts it off . whereas most others turn off one hour . but very minor . if you like perfect tasting coffee hurry , this machine you . if size scares you , just let you know , it fits perfectly under my upper cabinets when counter top . it little larger than standard 12-cup machine , but not much . it looks real nice also . when i finally wear this coffee maker out , i'll buy just like it . oh , it takes standard #4 cone shaped filters , or you use copper filter it comes . usual , amazon cheapest price i could find	1

heftier inner bowl this particular model people hunting all over place it when sizes smaller larger passed over . rice cooker fine job replaces our humongous panasonic 10 cupper . this one take forever cook . oh , yes : paddle bottom underneath packaging . i thought i missing it especially since i got ripped box ripped manual so i emailed got replacement paddle sanyo before i found original one during recycling . ooops ! unlike all previous panasonics , there not magnetic handle cup place rice paddle . pity . panasonic magnet won't stick this either so i always designated place rice paddle . we own rice cooker make our daily rice because designated machine less stressful . you need rice cooker ? no . steaming rice pyrex bowl certainly faster would require leaving burner low keep rice warm until you ready eat it . but there something compartmentalizing rice cooking part one day removes it constant consideration . p.s. we usually make two cups rice per meal there enough height remaining me place 4-cup round pyrex bowl some savory food warm . two months daily use later , i recommend this product because rice comes out fine but it take 35 (!!!) minutes . if you want faster rice , then steam rice rack pot . made chinai use this all time . this frugal ? no but it much less hassle than pressure cooker it made perfect long grain , short grain basmati rice first gowould i purchased this used cheaper price off craigslist ? nodid i shop around best total price including manufacturer website ? yes so should yo	1

cast iron usually isn't my first choice cookware several reasons : it isn't non-stick ; it heavy ( i tendonitis my hands ); it can't go dishwasher . thankfully , lodge new enamel-coated line takes care most these issues ! i recently got my hands one their two-quart enamel-coated casserole dishes review , apple green . i love wide , shallow design . after all , many casseroles wind up browned , crusty toppings -- which best part ! -- this allows more casserole come out way . i also find this little easier lift , particularly because wide handles , although you definitely need both hands i still let my husband move it out oven most par t.t wo quarts barely enough most casseroles , i find ; i usually prefer dishes two half quarts just because they allow little more room error help avoid spill-overs . however , i think most reasonably-sized casseroles fit this . quality enamel coating part what i love most lodge enamel-coated line . past i've used le creuset enamel-coated cast iron ( bought quite while ago , so if they've improved their coating recent years i can't address ) it definitely inferior . it wasn't slick , so it didn't clean easily nor release food easily . it also didn't stand up all well metal utensils . contrast , it hard imagine this coating wearing down any time soon . we made cornbread it it slid out pan without any help all . i love way this pan heats evenly , holds heat keeps casserole warm until you come back seconds , releases food ease , cleans like charm despite fact you should wash it hand . it elegant , wide shallow design perfect giving you more browned topping that so delicious most casseroles , it makes niftiest oval loaf cornbread . what more could you want ? well okay , i wish it could go dishwasher general principle , i wish they could come up way make cast iron lighter those us hand problems , i wish it held just little bit more . but good conscience i only take half point off those , so consider my rating 4.5	1

i bought this because i liked idea water filter inside . you can't find replacement filters . you can't measure water correctly . i tried just pouring water cup . didn't work because it goes right into water filter so it looks like it level 3 when it more . last straw other day water started brew through basket , basket sprang open . i water everywhere . it also seems take while brew small pot coffee . i usually made 3 or 4 cup pot it took 8 minutes . i never buy coffee pot this company again .	-1
i thought , 5 towels 10 bucks ? how nice could they ? well , surprisingly enough , quite nice . they high quality oversized . unlike many kitchen towels shrink down size postage stamp once washed , these not shrink much . sure take them out dryer immediately avoid excessive wrinkling , but would true any linen . i using them 3 months now colors holding up well i find myself reaching them first before my other towels , so i'm going buy set now .	1

i apologize reviewing product i don't own , never owned , won't ever own or need . general , i'm against doing this , but this case i feel really compelled comment what appears gimmick , hopefully dissuade some people wasting their money it . here my take this product -- it pizza stone thermometer backsplash . i can't imagine backsplash any practical use , thermometer , let put it this way : if your grill nice enough it capable generating or containing heat necessary emulate brick oven pizza , it probably one . even if it doesn't , you buy one separately under 10 bucks , free use it anywhere your kitchen or grill area . here what i recommend . go buy bona fide pizza stone , or better yet , few unglazed ceramic tiles home depot few bucks . way , you prepare more than one pizza simultaneously under $99 per pizza . my advice you , should , put rig like this together your own price large pepperoni domino . don't waste your money or your precious kitchen storage space this thing	1
i needed saucepan cook oatmeal would let go bits stick bottom . sounds silly , but i love oatmeal hate cleaning pan afterwards . this cleans up easily cooks evenly . i used it cooking rice , gravies other foods seem stick it always cleans up well . now , lid . there black band inside lid it scrubed off one night recently . i sat down , wrote email company next day , they new lid way . they asked only where send it , nothing else . i like companies stand product they sell . so , if you going buy this line , check black band , it should glass metal , not inside lid . if you problem product , always notify manufacturer , they almost always make it right , like calphalon me	1

i'm going against what many home chefs like all purpose knife . it not heavy , german , or made surgical stainless steel . these light knives , picking them up effortless . if you uses knives often , why get something heavy promotes carpal tunnel syndrome ? they not german . i think german knives overated overpriced . these knives great bargain . you get 2 whole sets cost one henckels or wusthoff knife . i admit cheaper steel they use these knives not hold their edge long nor you dishwash ( always handwash these ) . these knives rust if you throw them machine but they very easy sharpen get ridiculously sharp using those cheap 2 stage knife sharpeners . long you handwash sharpen periodically , you cut best them . secret caring your knife handwash , light oil cloth , sharpen your knives periodically .	1

mario batali lasagna pan best pan i've used . it extra deep so it holds really thick layers all good stuff i make my lasagnas . it weighs ton since it enameled cast iron , but why it cooks so evenly . i recommend adding 15+ minutes extra cooking time your recipes because oven heat heavy mass pan . cleaning easy . just soak it hot sudsy water while then all baked cheese sauce wipe off kitchen scrub pad . only surprises rim pan no enamel . it bare iron . but it cleaned without problem not rust when soaked overnight . this great pan , but it very heavy when empty even heavier when filled lasagna so make sure you've got some stong helpers around put it oven if necessary . :o	1

i used love this kettle . i've this kettle over four years now it developed same problem some people who gave it one-star reviews . electrical contacts degraded over past few months today i couldn't get it turn all no matter how many times i twisted it around its base . i've cleaned contacts twice past few months no avail . maybe improvement all day each time . looking inside base , i see why contacts die -- they don't grip metal ring spike all , but rather ring spike just rest loosely sprung metal . wish i'd thought inspect before buying i t.t here no excuse such bad design . they hoping repeat buy ? not going happen	-1
buying these types things problematical . one can't know how they work until they're tried out one own work space . things consider height width your open shelf areas . this wrap holder get way accessing things shelf below . addition hooks sit shelf above interfere what you put shelf . so keep this mind . holder works okay overall . i got two could only fit one into my main pantry . if i'd space , better solutions would : larger vertical unit installed inside cupboard or pantry door or full depth wire drawer screwed underneath shelf	1

i started out liking this machine , despite not so fond our former dirt devil " screamer " ridiculous belt changing routine . problems this machine : try cleaning pleated filter ( good luck ! ) exhaust blowing out sides then slightly downward blows around what you're trying vacuum up . i am really surprised no one else mentioned these two issues ( except one person who mentioned filter ) . after just one use , i knock pleated filter against trash loosen remove dirt -- no go . so what options ? leave dirt there continually clog it , then forced go buy new one $5.99 ? i honestly think this goal dirt devil , just make extra buck . if you're trying vacuum up pet hair , anything light weight , watch it blow around exhaust you go chasing it vacuum ( utterly futile ) . it loud side too . it powerful , but wrong way -- goal vacuum up debris , not blow it around your house	1
pepper casserole very cute , but i prefer wider , shallower shape pumpkin casserole which i also own . small , deep pepper tends cook some dishes unevenly due shape . instance , i used this casserole bake egg custard . end recommended cooking time middle remained liquid . time center firm , edges dry amp ; overcooked . this same dish cooks perfectly pumpkin . i find i use pumpkin far more frequently due superior baking results i've achieved it	1
i bought one these few months ago but unfortunately it spends lot more time my kitchen drawer than my regular garlic press . here what i like it : 1 . idea whacking unpeeled clove garlic order take skin off more easily great , but this any hard , flat object or even side chef knife blade . 2 . unlike garlic press , garlic twist gives you uniform pieces chopped garlic . while garlic press leaves you flattened skin you either discard or chop up hand , garlic twist gives you uniform pieces . unfortunately , this where garlic press wins out my standards , it difficult my lady-like hands " get garlic twist going . " after garlic gone through few destructive twists , it simple enough continue until you reach desired size chunks . however , first few twists quite difficult execute , you press two parts together quite hard , while simultaneously turning them , keep them popping apart jumping over garlic rather than punching through it . this problem occurs even just one clove . interesting idea , but classic garlic press still my favorite . sometimes i grate garlic ginger grater or microplane grater . larger quantities , zyliss chopper might job but i've never tried . garlic twist , however , drawbacks out-weigh advantages	1
this solid , basic stainless pressure cooker , quite bargain $41.45 price ( or $33 something after $25 off $125 kitchen purchases ) . advantages : * easy use flip pressure regulator quick release pressure * only 15 lbs pressure adequate normal pressure cooking * handles both sides makes cooker easy carry stable when full . * stainless won't interact food product such tomatoes . * 8 qt . capacity gives 4 qts capacity when cooking foaming products such beans or lentils . * easier clean than some pressure cookers i used . disadvantages : * only cooks 15 lbs pressure , where some recipes call only 10 lbs would adjusted . * most canning 10 lbs pressure sealevel up 1000 ft elevation * i respectfully disagree this cooker meant canning . it could process 3 or 4 pints pinch , but 23 qt pressure cooker canning workhorse hold 19 pts or 7 qts . manual suggests not canning it , it doesn't canning trivet included . * it much lighter weight than older presto models , so i don't know if it last long old ones . overall , it great pressure cooker most cooking , very good value	1

i bought this little wonder , one my niece one me . i lots tile my home . my niece hard wood floors tile kitchen bathrooms , carpet bedrooms . i bought dirt devil swifter rechargable vac , but it won't space rugs you hold down switch keep vacuum working . i bought it because it light . i got tired holding switch . i arthritis . new one swifter hadn't come out yet . so , desperation , i bought flair . it great ! change outlet because cord too short even my kitchen , it big , but that only draw back . i go tile space rugs tile infinitely . it electric not battery powered . i keep roller or turn it off switch right there top handle . i wash filter , don't buy new ones . cup small , but all i empty it . who wants keep cup dust dirt around , anyway--that just plain lazy . it such good strong vacuum , my niece even cleans carpet doorways . she says this little vacuum better than her bigger vacuum(not hoover ) , but i told her this little wonder lighter work areas than heavy carpet . happy cleaning	1
board right size carving up whole chicken " moat " , while modest width/depth , kept counters clean . plus it reasonably light its size . one small surprise me wood so very dry . it soaked up two very generous applications mineral oil very quickly . if it doesn't come oiling instructions , you'll still want oil it soon possible perhaps multiple applications each spaced out day . new comments : after seasoning board , hand washing , 6 months happy use , board split glued joint . this happened after it sitting counter week under weight homemade loaf bread medium-weight glass cake cover . my best guess board become just slightly ( most imperceptively ) warped constant distributed weight provided enough stress crack apart glue overnight -- 6+ " it ! i know nothing woodworking but i doubt seasoning alone strengthen joint or prevent minor warpage . so i'm lowering product 3 star rating	1

like several other reviews , i very dissapointed . we looked several machines francisfrancis !, gaggia ascaso . while these certainly more expensive machines , machine we replacing price parity breville . my observations : pros : solid well built constructionlong steamer wand . this allows you rest your carafe unit steam your milk while you put away dish or toast bagelsimple operate pleasant look atnice ergonomic features like storage compartment accessories under unit , removable foam wand , etc . consit fails horribly its core function , making good expresso steaming/foaming your milk . i use pods machine takes very long pull shot , it splattered all over ( due funky way they try " create " crema ) , ultimate product weak bitterthe steam very weak , took 30% longer warm up my machine than any machine we tested , it very inconsistent how much steam it injected . machine wastes lot water . they proud all priming purging features , but it steams belches it makes quite mess . i found myself reaching sponge towel several times during brewing process . net this great machine architecturally but horrid expresso maker . if this kind coffee acceptable you , there thousand less expensive brands trick . price , performance must better .	1

my husband thinks small appliances waste counterspace money . i don't always disagree , but we make press pot coffee twice day heating up water stove took 15+ minutes there always floating sediment bottom our kettle ... sounds appetizing ! i researched this kettle liked description water boiled quickly turned off automatically .... i also wanted it retain heat able taken off heating source serving . my husband ( i ) really like this pot . we use it not only coffee ( full pot boiling takes just under 5 minutes ) but boil water pasta other cooking . it saves me time i don't want kitchen all night .... this one small appliance we not want without . only change i would make handle seems bit large average hand so it not comfortable hold i still sediment ... which probably problem my water . least now i get into pot clean through large opening . no weird smells here we using daily 6 months	1

i bought this set my wife christmas , mainly because i stuck ideas what get her . she spends lot time kitchen she using old set chicago cutlery several unbranded cheap giveaway knives several years . none those knives great or sharp i hated trying put edge them even though i'm pretty good sharpening knives . essentially , knives just sharpened pieces steel appear pretty simple , straightforward instruments shouldn't difficult produce . but little experience some poor examples prove this not case . like most seemingly simple things , simplicity illusion . my experience not kitchen knives but it " working " knives . pocket knives fixed blade knives designed hard use nasty jobs i daily removing staples papers office chopping down woody weeds backyard cutting up boxes , rope , cording thin pieces aluminum . i know value blade take good edge hold it through lot abuse . i little research found several brands kitchen knives universal respect . wusthof always or near top everyone list . more often than not , it number one reviews surveys i came across . my wife little apprehensive sharpness knives out box . she quickly realized value really sharp kitchen knife , no time , she commenting how much easier it work wusthof than cheapo knives she using . she really making good use paring knife chef knife days since christmas . my own limited use chef knife this set confirms how well it handles cuts compared clunky chicago cutlery chef knife . after looking over more reviews , i've ordered wusthof 7 " hollow edge santoku go this set . designed thin cuts , it fit well other knives . i'll probably also get serrated edge bread knife no t-t oo-distant future round out wusthof set . this likely lifetime purchase our household makes high price more investment . i'm well pleased so my wife .	1
product stapled together . doesn't seem consistent quality other wusthof products	-1

product not without its flaws , but if your cat likes mindlessly chasing same thing over over this toy them . generally you need set it small shelf , table or desk aim it floor ( it only 2 settings where aim it ) . you're supposed able open it it start up , my unit little " funny " day 1 i open it , let it snap shut hard then it would turn then opening it second time it ready . once you start it up it runs 5-9 minutes . laser spins fast large circle ( depending how high up you place device ) couple seconds , then stops second , then repeats . every time it stops different place , typically few inches previous stopping point . it works out very well cats they try predict where it " land " . i would say this good toy turn right before you leave so cats play wear themselves out sleep while you're gone instead getting into trouble while you're away . it especially popular dumber cats group , because it repetitive . ( or maybe their hunting instinct easier trigger	1

we bought this stand mixer september 2006 , first time we used it we noticed silvery-gray deposit batter when it scraped bowl ( both bowls ) . thinking it some coating new bowls , we washed scrubbed them thoroughly -- still same thing . we thought it may some oil coming motor escaping where beaters mounted , but doesnt seem case . 4th time we used it center beater jammed cannot removed -- it abiut 1/3 " locked place wont budge . while struggling remove it , some grayish powder came falling out -- maybe that where deposits . anyway , i wish we hadnt bought this product would advise you find option	-1

i purchased this product @m retailer ( my first mistake ? ) . unit attractive . coffee function works advertised . upon setup , i discovered espresso function inoperative . i wait until weekday contact krups customer service . they not particularly responsive , but ultimately agreed pay shipment their center , , upon verification it inoperative , they would replace it . one month later i received replacement . upon setup , replacement make espresso . however , next day espresso function again failed , this time different " symptoms " ( initiation pump , then failure blinking liht display . i again contacted customer service , now they offer $10 refund shipping ( return label function " inoperative moment ) , shipment replacement item upon confirmation shipment . krups refused refund . retailer , course , not refund , since i now replacement . so i am now well into my second month ownership , no espresso !!

first let me say this product arrived my home faster then i expected , especially since it right before christmas . product itself great . i just purchased new , very expensive wooden cutting board i wanted sure protect it . someone store where i bought board suggested i get " food grade mineral oil " . i really no idea this type product but once i started searching web info , i found it best thing use keep your wooden boards like new years . i unable locate any this oil stores i go normally so i turned my tried true friend , amazon.com sure enough , they this product . once i began using it , i could tell right away what difference it made how my new cutting board looked . i typically use my board every day using oil once week . board stayed " fresh " looking no lasting cut marks no water damage after wash ups	1

we put these knives our wedding registry after reading cooks illustrated kitchen knife review . they most highly recommended these set high-end wustoff knives . we chose these because they're much better value ( when these go sale , you pick up whole victorinox set same price one good wustoff knife ) . we've very happy our choice ( our friends who bought them us -- gotta love registries ! ) . blades very sharp , knives very well-balanced comfortable hand , everything very easy clean . we've our set few months now blades still sharp day we got ' em . physical design knives very functional . they aren't quite sharp heavier forged metal blades some higher end knives like fancier wustoffs . these stamped sheet metal rather than individually forged . but they're still very good , much better value than their forged competitors . one note : we bit confused difference forschner victorinox versions this knife set . but it turns out they're exact same knives , just distributed under two different labels . forschner brand name they've used years sell professional chefs . they only recently started selling under victorinox name attempt reach home gourmets , under theory people already associate victorinox name quality . but we victorinox version , they're exactly same my friend forschners . so you buy either ( whichever cheaper )	1

this grill comes handy middle michigan winter when we can't fire up our outdoor bbq . it cooks quickly cleans fairly easily . i never dared place it dishwasher , although it sounds like lot people so i might try it . there few downfalls - you get grease splatters countertop no matter how careful you if you like your meat medium-well prepared crack window open because ' burnt ' smell linger days otherwise	1

i agree mr. vasicek review most part , other reviewer below who mentioned problems clock . i got this pot because it would more difficult break than ones glass carafes , lack burner meant no more burnt coffee . i problem filter flopping over getting grinds my coffee , may try permanent filter solution . i definitely recommend pre-heating carafe hot water , regardless time year . otherwise coffee gets tepid fast . coffee not hot it could , most time , but maybe that also amount ( also preheated ) milk i put my cup . i don't like delayed brew function , but only because it time-based , like alarm clock , i'd rather it straight delay , because i don't make coffee same time every morning -- i'd like able set it go off after set time , so i could go outside , or shower , or whatnot , return fresh coffee . but it doesn't really matter , because clock itself seems bit wonky now i've appliance few months . i can't say whether we've bumping it accidentally changing time , or whether there problem clock itself ; anyway , it seems weak point . i've cleaned it few times white vinegar ; i can't get all coffee stains out carafe but i don't really care . i don't drip problem pouring coffee , but i line lid arrow up carefully found it helps steady lid when you pour . if you try pour without lid , it often spill ! but compared pouring out little glass carafes " freebie " type coffee makers , this one great . forget pause function ... if you take carafe out during brew cycle you just asking trouble . all all , i'd say it not " perfect coffee maker " but it most suitable i encountered recent years -- speaking someone who recently ruined percolator running it without water . i would buy this one again	1

this heater works reasonably well , it not too noisy low setting , but it electronic control designed extremely bad . first all it three operational modes : low , high auto . low uses half its heating power runs fan slower quieter speed . high - uses full power noisiest . thermostat setting/operation not available nether under low nor under high mode . auto mode you set desired temperature heater reasonably good job maintaining set temperature , but - when it auto mode heater runs it full power becomes noisy . there no way make use thermostat low heating power . i think most people would actually want use auto mode low power , especially if they use heater bedroom , but some genius delonghi decided save few cents not providing this option . heater also ' forgets ' your last auto temperature setting after you switch it off defaults 75 , so every time you switch it again you adjust temperature - pretty annoying imo . spite fact i got it pretty cheap ( under 40 ) , it going back .	1

i wanted pressure cooker some time , recently received this one gift . i used it number times since getting it , it becoming my favorite cooking utensil . since getting it , i cooked : - beans ( less than 25 minutes perfect texture no presoaking)- chicken ( 25 minutes fall-of-the bone tenderness)- roast ( most tender , juicy best tasting my family eaten)a 10-quart cooker may somewhat larger than many people think they need . i love large size because i cook family or company don't worry not enough room . this simple use , easy clean way delicious food family hurry . taking chiken out refrigerator dinner table often less than 40 minutes . while this also true other pressure cookers , fagor splendid cooker easy use locking mechanisms , it simple design makes it reliable easy clean . couple suggestions : read instructions . while this cooker simple use clean , instructions contain number very useful hints . i read instructions beforehand , my first dish would less hassle than it . second , buy accessories . this pot just pot - no trivet , no basket , no spoons , nothing else . serious pressure cooking , you need some these other utensils . final comment : you won't get better this price . i recommend this any serious cook who limited time	1
this things * * work , although fan doesn't blow heated air very far away unit . it possible adjust thermostat knob so it keeps your room right temperature , but when it reaching temperature you've set , it switches off constantly . ( like 20 times 10 seconds -- seriously . ) i'm not sure this one isn't slightly defective , since most thermostat controls non-switching region where they don't change their state long temperature within certain range . instance , if you set your furnace thermostat 68 , it turns furnace 67 , not 67.992 turns it off 69 , not 68.002 . this apparently doesn't feature -- it literally runs less than 1/10th second regular basis . i wonder how long thermostat relay last constant cycling .	1

i just recently received this odor eliminator . it much bigger than i expected but very easy setup use . filters relatively cheap only need purchased every 2 months . whisper quiet mode well unit just whisper quiet . if you trying get rid particularly bad smell you turn it high speed which moderately noisy fan noise . living dorm sometimes things get bit smelly ( if you know what i mean ) . this device always your back whether it your garbage you don't want take out or your room mate pile smelly clothes . this modern age we don't always time take care these things most sprays simply mask odors . this great hamilton beach product eliminates odors sends them packing	1
i spent thousands dollar , meyers cookware everthing kitchenaid , anolon , prestige , faberware , amp ; circulan , just name few . though meyers manufacture very high quality pots amp ; pans i would recommend them anyone it just sad if you any problem them , under warranty , you go throught chain command , never gets you anywhere , even if you want speak upper management rudeness customer service department . their customer service department employees always very rude snotty they act like they doing you favor even talk you their products . don't get me wrong they make good cookware , probably best , but you consumer mercy their customer service their descision or your fait wheather your life time warranty honored or not	1

this little unit heats two our children rooms ( 10x8 12x14 ) perfectly ! their rooms normally around 63 degrees while house 66 , this unit elevate them 75-80 degrees very little effort . i know because i used electric thermometer measure temperature . don't expect this unit completely heat room without presence central home heating unit . meaning , this unit not heat small cabinet middle wood itself . but if you central heating ( baseboard or central-air ) keep temperature low save gas bills this perfect unit ! it made complement them . only thing i wish it digital thermometer so i set it exact temperature instead doing it feel . but then , it so inexpensive i can't really complain ..	1

first all , let me say i agree reviewer who deducted stars 9 " skillet due non-stick coating . since non-stick coatings chemicals , i refuse use any cooking utensil coating them . original , baked enamel finish this skillet works great . secret using moderate heat adding oil once pan warms up , then adding food items . if meat sticks , it unstick it carmelizes ( this also applies their grilling skillets ) . i find i just wipe mine out keep using it until i make chili or something messy like . then all i fill skillet water let it sit while , then it rinses clean . maximum , i've taken boar bristle brush couple spots once or twice , that all . i beseech this company leave non-stick coating off their skillets even though one reviewer below seems prefer it . or minimum give consumer choice but i'd bet most would prefer original , satin finish . fact , i bought this skillet because fired enamel finish i discovered my well-known name brand stainless steel skillet stew/pasta pot too much nickel them so i can't use them . anyway , i love this skillet . it makes good wok too burner under center pan . i fry up one veggie , push it off side where it stays warm while i fry next one , then push it over until i'm finished . i say i loved this skillet ? i wish they made lid this skillet i buy brand which doesn't match but it works . since most skillets come without lids , this silly , i agree . so then , i highly recommend this skillet both cooking easy clean-up	1

i nice set calphalon nonstick cookware . unfortunately , we bit high heat cooking brown meat , nonstick not good . plus saute pan we little small side . so i've keeping my eye open decent stainless pan . spotted this one costco endcap picked it up . tramontina pan nice heavy . it thick base , heats beautifully . wide enough put down 6 pork chops , deep enough soups such . handle stays cool , which nice . but what really impressed me when we moved cleanup . since we browned chops , there plenty stuck bits . i took pan off heat , rinsed it , covered stuck bits water , threw it back heat . let it steam little , then turned it off . first thing when i went back it , lid sealed tight . speaks good construction , since it actually managed vacuum seal . turned heat back lid immediately released . second thing it rinsed clean only light touch soft brush	1

this deepest lasagna pan i able find , why i bought it . i owned it several years , but i don't bake or roast often . it worked adequately . i gotten my money worth . because it stainless steel , it feels lightweight . it not made thick metal , therefore feels just little cheap . gourmet cooks might sneer it . stainless steel , it shows no signs rust , even handles , after soaking kitchen sink . exterior still looks nice . interior not any kind non-stick coating . spatula/turner/flipper utensil , which comes pan , very useful . it thin enough slide under food turned over skillet . it little flexible , but not extremely flexible like some wimpy spatulas . it won't flex , wiggle , collapse while carrying something heavy like say thick pork chop . i use spatula very frequently . it thin enough slide under fresh-baked soft cookies , remove them pan , without making mess cookies . rack put inside pan , fits nicely , use when roasting meat . rack not very high , so it would not adequate roasting something extremely high fat , such goose , would result deep layer melted fat bottom pan . rack also used cooling rack baked goods , although not intended such . wires not spaced close together ideal cooling rack , thus small cookies may fall through .	1

2006 year specialty roombas . their " high end upgrade " this year intellibin option their top line model , scheduler . we 2 schedulers love them , so i intrigued this intelli-bin . however , extra $20 , i actually consider this bad feature , not good feature . here why . essence you get exact same robot scheduler robot , which i love . however , they added one light , which tells you if bin full . theory here you'll clean it when you see light . however this awful theory ! roombas need kept clean run well . even if there only little dirt there , if it hair wrapped around something you leave it there , it going wrap more more tightly start damage parts . you need give it cleaning each day . not thorough , hefty cleaning , but shake dust bin quick glance brushes . if it becomes normal natural part your schedule , it really no big deal all . i definitely think you should not dust bin light - most definitely not use it know when clean your roomba . this would really lead more roomba issues ... which isn't good owners nor good irobot ! roombas run wonderfully when they're kept clean - they break down quickly if allowed fill crud . you might expect any appliance . so letting roombas fill up more crud than they should , irobot going get bad reputation . which shame . we end up getting intellibin when we issues one our regular roombas send it repairs . because roomba such hot item right now , our failure right before 2006 holiday season , it over 2 months we still hadn't gotten replacement roomba back . we called complained , they sent us off intellibin version free upgrade . it works exactly same scheduler , i kept waiting bin full light light up . bin * stuffed * full junk it kept going . eventually after few runs it light up , but i really question how well suction could working then . i really would much rather just empty it after each run - it 20 second job - vs waiting light light up roomba performance suffer result . my verdict - get regular scheduler which * awesome * keeps our home incredibly clean . ignore this improvement . it not worth $20 relying it could actually cause you more trouble . quick comment cost - people easily pay $500-$700 dishwasher , think it essential part life . i certainly know i love my dishwasher . dishwasher , you still certain things hand - fine crystal stemware , large pots . even so , dishwasher makes your daily life easier . i consider roomba far better than dishwasher , especially if you pets . every morning , all pet hair dander just gone . it makes my daily life - since i work home am breathing air every second day - infinitely better healthier . roombas cheaper , too	1

my fiance bought this coffee maker wal-mart sale . it worked flawlessly week or two . then i thought it would good idea put tea bag compartment where coffee goes . my fiance told me later instructions advised against it might damage unit . next day or two unit malfunctioned - it would buzz then two blue lights would blink . sometimes we could unplug it start over it would work but problem seemed become more frequent ( frustrating ) . i noticed lid locks place while unit brewing , so round top part inside apparently rotates locks into bottom part ( where pods go ) . it occurred me buzzing sound sound locking mechanism rotating into place that when problem occurs ( intermittently ) . so we started pressing down lid before clicking brew button it always works fine when we . ( apparently if lid doesn't close snuggly then locking mechanism jams you get blinking lights must then reset it unplugging it . ) i hope this review helps anyone else this problem . i've seen several comments others same issue . other than this one issue which turns out minor if you know workaround , we love this coffee maker ! we also use it just make quick hot water ramen noodles or tea ( but i don't put tea bags machine any more , just cup ! ) . we've it couple months now use it least once day , usually more	1

very practical inexpensive way carry your knives if you're " cook go . " 7 slots should more than enough carry your essential knives , sharpening steel maybe tongs , peeler and/or zester - it also slot accomodate cleaver . henckels roll generous 19 inches long , which could , conceivably , allow you carry even your woodman pal . remember , you'll still need keep your knives protected blade guards , otherwise you'll cut into roll - extra expense which you need take into account . finally , i feel , they included handle , it would made superior product .	1

it seems i've spent years trying find " perfect " teakettle . something would give good honest , audible whistle when boiling , then allow one pour steaming hot water without put hand anywhere near spou t.t hat didn't seem like much ask , but we heck time finding such thing . we found some close , but which you fill only through spout . it seems me one should lid pot like this , able get inside clean it , inspect damage or wear , or whatever . suddenly , we came across this one . amazon there 4-cup version , two 8-cup versions . there one copper bottom resemble traditional revereware look , but after looking pictures , we bought one pure stainless steel top bottom . entire top pot non-shiny plastic some kind -- one those new space-age materials not get hot metal or some other materials . designers revere should commended making total break tradition so they could create pot so practical . lid top not centered beneath handle , which means you reach inside , or fill it , more easily than typical pot where handle gets way . handle very well balanced " trigger " open spout well-positioned . you hold spout partly open , or pull it completely open , which point trigger " locks " it open position . this saves lot finger fatigue when pouring multiple cups tea , or whatever . close it , one simply pushes forward back trigger . you don't need instructions , although they included . when you pick this thing up pour it , it feels totally natural your hand , you figure it out instinctively . it grea t.t he spout slight diagonal " crease " its tip drip-free pouring , which just thoughtful feature overall thoughtful original design . we chose larger size mostly able serve more than couple people time if we should company . we're glad we made choice , because honestly 8-cup version looks small compared our old kettle . other one more rounded perhaps larger capacity . i haven't measured capacity revere model , i'm not obsessed it , i'm sure it suit our needs . i suspect compact appearance most likely function efficient design . this one those purchases , its own small way , makes every day better improving small task one frequently . course it far too early tell how it stand up long use , but we're quite satisfied ours expect it pleasure long time	1

i say , i think mr. walker review these glasses isn't taking into account these hand blown pieces . every piece hand blown glass i've ever owned small bubbles minor imperfections , which i personally think adds charm owning something made human hands rather than stamped out machine . far consistency , four these i own remarkably consistent taking all into account . yes , they not identical , but really , hand blown , you cannot expect . my spanish teacher high school told story shopping mexico one trip . she went glass blower picked out vase she loved . she thought it would fun buy several these her friends gifts when she returned . she asked craftsman make her 10 " just like this " . man balked , started shaking his head , begging , " por favor , poquito diferente " . he simply couldn't make each one identical . these lovely shotglasses , great price	1

my old " dirt devil " died old age i needed replacemen t.t his eureka product better job cleaning than my old one -- even carpet . i only one complaint ; one unexpected problem -- dust bags . they much larger than ones i've used before hold more dirt , i like . problem rubber flange around opening keeps it leaking dust . it works fine , but i am deathy allergic natural rubber even touching it could , other rubber products , send me emergency room -- or worse . like all other manufacturers this planet , other than those who make medical supplies , this information not disclosed product information . this failure annoys me very much , but hardly unique eureka company . thank goodness i not live alone , so i am able get my husband change vacuum bags , but latex allergic peson living alone this would very major drawback	1
i purchased this gift my son who loves anything dipped chocolate . he his eye much larger fountains . i wanted something smaller he could use without making big mess . i also not want 3 pounds chocolate melted once . this little pot perfect reason . you melt 1 1/2 cups chips or whatever type chocolate you want . this allow you dip over 2 pounds strawberries numerous pretzels one batch . because it size ease use it pulled out several times already . i highly reccomend this anyone who looking smaller chocolate fondue pot . think it mini crock pot that what it reminds me most .	1
i love this pan ! it perfect so many things , especially pan meals ! only problem , my opinion , black coating . i know they use this coating frying pans so you fry higher temp , but inside never looks nice . it not non-stick , but i definitely prefer light gray interior . overall , though , this one keeper	1
it soft medium-sized . didn't pay too much them so didn't feel too bad when friends would come over ask if they could take one . now i don't any left , but they're interseting little soft " stuffed animal " kind thing . no real practical purpose probably - i heard it horror if it ever opens/spills its contents . it kind funny - thing itself soft - but it comes huge box tons air pillows ( when you order it amazon least ) . so if you're moving need packing material , then here 2-for-1 special .	1

i got more than i expected . which good , because it seemed over priced when i bought it . but it only one i could find truly variable temp control . now , i think price fair . pro's- variable temprature : this why i picked this product . i wanted full control temp water . - filtered spout : i don't use it . could useful keeping tea or any other particles pot while pouring . - dock station : pot easily removed doc , so there no cord way when pouring . - hidden cord : cord winds up inside dock . makes it easy hide extra cord , if you luxury . see cons :( . - insulated : keeps water hot long time . - auto off : turns when it gets temperature . cons- 4ft cord : i could use 1 more foot :( . wish list : - stay option : keeping water temperature would nice option . rather than letting it slowly cool down . - thermometer : doesn't tell you actual temperature water . not even estimate temperature knob .	1

when i got my fagor pressure cooker i thought it going long relationship . but i learned over past few months it much more trouble than it worth . it may cut cooking time half , but it certainly doubles clean-up time . it hard regulate cooking food that locked inside cooker . regular cooking pot i look inside see how things going , add things right time , make any adjustments i need . i like ease just bringing regular pot boil , reducing simmer , coming back when timer goes off . i hate trying get pressure right , worrying it too much pressure , then waiting it depressurize or depressurizing it manually speed things up . food textures often all wrong . when it ? you can't just open it up , look inside say " ten more minutes " . same price you get some very nice copper-bottom pans last your whole lifetime no gaskets or valves need replacing	1

i use this vacuum supplement my dyson i 2 dogs , 2 cats , 2 children . it works well wood floors even my basement floors where i keep my cats ' litter boxes . however , cord short it not work very well carpet . sometimes i'll vacuum closet spaces or use it our stairs ; however , i would not recommend using this your main source sweeping up after your pets . my dyson miracle worker compared this , customer service department dyson much more efficient . when one my children broke my dyson hose , i called customer service department they sent me hose no charge . shark filter costs nearly $18 replace , because shark small vacuum , it not take long before filter needs replaced if you pets who shed lot . i even rinsed filter , but it still bears replacing . it great sweeping up small jobs , but if you looking something suction up large space or after pets children , keep looking	1

i actually preferred pfaltzgraff mystic pattern but my oldest dd her husband gave me set cappucino christmas . service 4 not enough which why i purchased set through amazon . price right - even shipping - this set cheaper than local department stores . first , i'd like say my order arrived quickly however 2 plates broken . rather than just send replacement plates , amazon sent entire set - which also came broken plate so i sent back set 3 broken plates . what they these ? why not keep unbroken items replacements ? it would definitely cheaper shipping out individual items than entire sets ! dishes - i haven't seen any signs discolorings reported other reviewers . i like set sturdy but after using corelle many years it taken some time get adjusted it . i love size shapes plates , mugs bowls . bowls deep - perfect ice cream or cereal so deep it eliminates spills . mugs easy handle even hottest beverages inside . course , all pieces easy clean . color neutral - goes perfect my kitchen . can't wait add other pieces it	1

i ton research air filters before i purchased this one . this product not reviewed anywhere but here - which strange . said , only review positive one , which other machines reviewed air raid sirens or too expensive keep stocked filters . so , i figured , how bad could this one ? i've it 2 days , so i cant really give long-term review . however , i am pleased already . whether its actually working , or i believe its working so therefore its working , i am already sleeping better . i suffering terrible hay fever waking up stuffy noses , headaches , nose dryness , etc . past two nights , i've slept lot better . noise : low setting sounds like white-noise machine you might put baby room . its low hum , no clicking , constant low noise . it doesnt bother me . higher speeds definitely loud - but not like siren , or anything obtrusive . highest speed sounds like loud air conditioner doesnt shut off --- you turn up your tv slightly . said , i dont find it soo loud i am annoyed . smell : i've read these machines bad rubbery smell . first , this one slight rubber scent . it went away after one day running it one low . i dont smell anything now . cost : pre-filter $7 amazon i've read you dont replace it lot . i not bought hepa replacement , so i wont comment . size : instructions say you need 3 feet around it , so you cant really put it under table . its width nightstand , so i think its perfect corner room , but you it away wall . honestly , i'm so desperate breath , i don't really care it sticks out like sore thumb . if you really into things tucked away , you might want look into " tower " air filter . this one sits corner my bedroom , slightly away wall	1

i several rooms including my kitchen white shiny ceramic tile floors white grout . no matter what i used clean floor i dry it i cleaned most often within day or two it looked hazy or smeary . since using this steam vac i go well over week cleanings floor never looked better . steamer removes surface dirt grout , so if you're buying it primarily clean grout expect still use elbow grease or chemicals . it too messy practical cleaning windows it didn't very well cleaning soap film off shower door . it , however , very well mold . i also love it cleaning my jewelry silk plants my freshwater aquarium ! no more brown spots silk plants . best part all things i've mentioned -- no chemicals inhale or contaminate environment . unit sturdy , heats up quickly includes lot handy attachments .	1

this kettle great ! i use it several times day ; it heats water quickly doesn't require lot maintenance . thus far it seems pretty durable- i just hope it stays way .	1
i've used this washer 50 loads since buying jr early october , 2006 . i live studio new york bought this one because ( 1 ) it sink adapter , which front-loading 14.3 -lb model didn't seem include ( 2 ) 17.5 inches wide/deep , it fit through my bathroom door , which front-loading 14.3 -lb model ( 20.5 inches wide ) wouldn't . out box , you install included metal pan bottom . install it so it convex : there reason legs so high . one problems i during installation one screws holding this metal pan body comes very close clamp holding gooseneck drain tube it exits body . clamp fallen out position , end screw close where clamp goes . i don't think i ever danger puncturing drainage tube , but it something watch out . you need place hang drainage tube , 31.5 40 inches high . machine cannot fill tub water height above maximum height drainage path . my first two loads , i made puddle water ground . there two reasons this : first time , water supply hose not tightened sufficiently machine end , water dribbled out behind machine until i figured out what going . tightened ( i used wrench ) , there no leak . my second load , i put too many clothes ( more later ) there water-resistant nylon jacket top . just before very first spin cycle , some water cupped jacket not drain out wash water . when tub started spin , water came out . i never loaded many clothes into washer again , haven't any spills since . during normal wash cycle , machine following steps three times : fill , agitate , agitate , drain , spin , drain , spin , drain , spin . second third iterations called " rinse " cycle . often , water out drain still bubbly after second spin , i suspect i'm using too much detergent . ( i'm using quarter capful or less all no-fragrance 3x liquid concentrate . ) so , i run rinse cycle . if machine detects unbalance condition during spin , it stop , fill tub water , agitate attempt redistribute clothes before draining spinning again . i think machine this two or three times before giving up beeping ten times alert user unbalance condition . during agitation process , this machine tends intertwine long or extended parts clothing into braid-like knots . this includes shirt sleeves socks . example , when i wash four or five long-sleeved shirts together , i always untie separate two or three shirts where sleeves twisted together . i think good washing where wash water touch every surface clothes , tied together prevents this . these problems probably would not happen front-loading washing machine . what capacity this washer ? well , i would say : 2 bath towels ; or2 pairs jeans or pants ; or2 sweatshirts 1 pair sweat pants ; or4-5 long-sleeved oxford shirts ; or6 small-size undershirts ; or8-12 medium-size boxer underwear . that " high " water level . you may able load more than , but i think clothes won't get clean . i once tried wash terrycloth robe . robe fit tub , but machine always got unbalance condition when it tried spin . i think it sort like trying run centrifuge only one tube . sometimes after spin cycle i find sock or shirt stretched across middle tub , instead thrown centrifugally against tub walls . using my dsc-p71 digital camera multi-burst 30 frames-per-second mode light dark shirt washer , i estimate initial spin 450 rpm ( light shirt passed once every 4 frames ) final spin 780 rpm ( light shirt passed 6.5 times 0.5 seconds - once every other frame ) . if i hang clothes my studio ( not bathroom ) , then they dry one day or less , depending humidity . it takes much longer if i hang them bathroom	1

i not good pillow long time . i wouldn't pay upwards fifty dollars pillow . but i gave after reading reviews got this one . it way overpriced my opinion but they onto very good idea . first , i it couple weeks it pretty flat now . coils only very center pillow , times you notice them there , but not bad way , just noticable . problem fluff they add pillow must cheapest possible nothing . i imagine i really strange looking square blob surrounded moat flat fabric pretty soon . first , it really comfy . i think if they either put high quality fluff around it , or better yet put coils through entire thing , higher ones center , this would outstanding , beyond all other pillows ! but it , it not worth price yet . if you tons money burn , go ahead try it . i wouldn't recommend anyone get two sleep once , they would awkward they would falling off sides eachother . you could use regular pillow below this one , but then you back into same pillow finding - switching game we all want avoid . i would given three stars if it lot cheaper , but after going flat after only few weeks , price , i give it two	1

i just replaced my gaggia titanium which after 3 months decided break down . i decided rather than replace same machine go much-praised jura machines . z5 particularly appealed it unique one-touch cappucino function , which avoids clumsy looking " automatic frothing attachments " found so many machines . machine easy set up , almost same footprint titanium , so doesn't take up too much space . it comes classy looking thermal milk container ( 1 litre ) which keeps milk ready chilled up 8 hours . front machine brushed aluminium ( not plastic many jura machines ) which far easier keep clean than titanium brushed stainless steel ( fingerprints ! ) . display prompts clear ( product names such " 1 espresso " changed should you so desire - i personally can't see point this , since name isn't displayed until you press key dispense drink . temperature ( also adjustable ) coffee , hot water also milk fantastic - i mine set " normal " setting it very hot - much more so than titanium many other machines which even set " highest " still could hotter . crema good , taste great . brew group non-removable self-cleaning ( you prompted when run rinse cycle or pop cleaning tablet ) . you program quantity , temperature strength all drinks , choose override these on-the-fly should you wish , which very handy . water container larger than titanium most other domestic machines you use claris water filter cartridges , or alternatively opt use descaling tablets every so often ( again , you prompted when this ) . dump box , drip tray suitably large so not emptied too frequently ( every 20 cups ) . i only 2 grumbles this machine . one central coffee spout ( which illuminates cups during dispensing coffee ) not adjust high enough large mugs . silly thing you also dispense coffee cappuccino spout which offers 2 interchangeable spouts - one small cups one tall mugs . why they couldn't make central coffee spout raise same height shame , but not end world . my second gripe consumables - ie . filters / descaling tablets / cappuccino cleaner / machine cleaning tablets way over-priced . since you use jura-brand ones keep within warranty conditions , you don't much option but pay these high prices . overall though , if you money , then go it - this machine fantastic , looks great , quietest fully automatic far - this doesn't wake up whole house when you make coffee	1
we apricot tree my parents ' house my dad used love make frozen apricots . problem drying them however , they stick dehydrator sugars concentrate fruit . if you dried fruits ( we apples , pears peaches ) you know they stick normal trays . berries fall through . if you into dehydrating your produce , these tray inserts come out so you scrape off dried product wash them easily . i wish these jerky-fruit-leather sheets came dehydrator but they don't . if you grow vegetables fruits , this very useful processing your crop .	1

save yourself lot trouble don't buy this one ! first time i bought it , it worked 2 weeks , then decreased output due black paint flaking off nebulizer ( part makes mist ) . so i returned it bought one ... this one worked off week then never worked right after , despite my careful cleaning disinfecting , just like owners manual instructs . i use it my baby room ( very small room ) , after first week , couldn't get humidity above 20% . it just not dependable , which pain when she wakes up constantly throughout night sniffing fussing due dry air ! i just ordered vornado 2.8 gal cool mist humidifier ... hopefully work much better !	-1

since reviews broken wires both written well over 1-2 years ago , i thought surely problem corrected . why would company continue sell broken product ? well , apparently this company perfectly fine doing just ! like previous posters , wire my board arrived broken . there no damage packing , so it not shipping issue . i ordered this product superbowl party few days . obviously i cannot use it . i haven't able find number , just address , so i can't even complain it today . not order this product !!!!!!!!! amazon ... wake up quit allowing your customers buy this item . it reflects poorly you	-1

great idea , just what i looking -- salt shaker lets you choose whether it fine shake , big shake , pouring ( recipes ) , or closed ( humid environments ) . great product	1
overall i dont any major complaints - seems great unit what i want it - humidify my house . i plan running it 24/7 during winter addition my furnace humidifier which isnt quite cutting it . this should help reduce filter problems since i wont standing water unit . assembled quickly - wheels not just gravity based like one review - they little rims make them stay bottom . i wouldn't recommend rolling it around like roller coaster but it gets job . based upon everything i read humidifiers some cleaning etc comes territory which i handle no problem . very simple filling water containers - you need deeper sink or tub fill them . i like fact it two so i run it low fan just fill one they easier(lighter ) carry . top removes easily replacement filters/cleaning unit which one nice selling points me(cheaper filters)i consider it run pretty quiet low medium fan settings - high noticable but if you want pump moisture into air over large area .. you it somehow . it blow cool air so keep mind . digital reading/setting humidity nice seems accurate long you dont crowd humidifier . not sure what i think ionizer feature - not like i measure air content see if it works but i it anyway . it make semi frequent gurgling noise it dispenses water into base it runs which one minor complaint it seems like unit could more " snug " when you put tanks but these very minor observations . i'm happy now - good luck	1

i love my dualit ! our old toaster died one sunday morning so monday i started searching new one . we cuisanart - i planned buying same brand toaster maybe just 4 slot version until i read reviews . one sale local department store ( $100)got miserable reviews amazon , so i searched searched searched only toaster got consistantly good reviews dualit . i ended up purchasing refurbished dualit website half price . i'm not one skimp kitchen appliances or gadgets , but spending over $200 toaster seemed bit extreme . now i've received it i've decided it worth every penny . if it breaks tomorrow , i'd definitely run right out spend pay full price replace it . i love fact operates completely different than any other toaster out there . it best preheat it - but once you you put pieces bread one right after consistant results . none problems you w/american toasters when they get heated where first piece perfect , next too light , next comes out more like piece bread so . other thing i love fact you raise lower bread when timer goes off , versus american toasters where you push toast down activate toaster . stupid push button/latch mechanism death every toaster i've ever owned . i playing couple cuisanarts department store both units it broken - just store use , let alone actual use ! now back price again . my sister who doesn't appreciate good kitchenware swears cheap toasters because she " replace them every couple years when something breaks " . i started think back my old cuisanart i loved . i received it shower gift when we married 8 years ago time it $60 . it great toaster if you averaged it out it cost $8 year own . so - given , if i replaced cheap toaster every other year , i doubt i could find $16 toaster even discount store would last more than year . hopefully i haven't cursed my dualit but if so , like i said earlier , i'd replace it full priced non-refurbished any day . buy one , you'll happy you .	1
when these mugs arrived , i surprised see how gorgeous they . color ( cobalt ) , glaze , shape , weight , generous handle - all perfect ! they even fit under spout my senseo coffeemaker . great mugs , i love them !	1
i surprised what poor reviews most crock pots received amazon.com, but i decided buy this little one when i saw it target $9.99 . figured even if it didn't work well , that not much money lose ! well , this my first crock pot i love it . i'm glad there one this small . i usually fill it only half way then leftovers , but it could probably feed family four without leftovers . lot reviews other crock pots said lids often fit poorly , but lid mine perfect . i've used it seven times so far everything wonderful ! i particularly like applesauce recipe comes crock pot , it makes best applesauce ever it nice just peel them night before wake up hot applesauce ( also good over ice cream ) . keep mind crock pot only low heat setting , but i haven't any trouble cooking recipes call high setting here . just takes bit longer . also , it not tough all convert recipes larger crocks fit this one . mine doesn't any problem cooking hot , maybe it just other reviewer crock pot . i would recommend this anyone , it well worth money	1

excellent machine but ware you must keep this machine clean steam/hot water nozzle . if it gets blocked first thing it ask ventilated .. then pressure cut off switch may ' pop ' machine may seem lock up - there no autoreset pressure switch must manually reset inside . it not worth �s sending repair - but not really user fix . so warned - keep your nozzles clean	1
