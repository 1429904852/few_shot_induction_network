sometimes it sprays when she barks , most time it doesn't . so i would say its effectiveness rather low . it not battery or fill level - maybe it just depends dog . i bark into it myself it sprays just fine . ( my children found this amusing .	-1
design using dc adapter led booklight extremely poor . it possible i missed warning tells you remove batteries before using dc adapter . but , it must not very big . i combined two ended up batteries leaked all over inside battery case . these brand new batteries . there not seem anything protecting batteries dc adapter so power goes right into them . this bad . modern devices expected work either battery or adapter without remove batteries . i assumed i could leave batteries so when i home i could use adapter , but traveling i would use batteries . don't make this mistake	-1
somewhat insomniac i read well into hours night book light essential me . i therefore purchased itty bitty booklight . if you use this light it essential purchase power supply two reasons . firstly , there no auto shut-off so if you fall asleep reading your batteries wear down very quickly . secondly , when using batteries , they start dimming rather quickly making it hard eyes difficult read resulting constant need new batteries . this light also extremely fragile . over couple years i went through 7 these ! i would not recommend this light - amount you spend never-ending purchasing batteries or expensive power supply , constant new purchases after it breaks , you might well splurge buy decent book light . i now tri lite capstone enterprises ( available barnes nobel - come get it stock amazon ! ) it terrific ! it clock alarm timer . you set it stay any period time once it reaches time light flashes . time you extend minutes . if you don't so , example you're sleeping , it automatically shut off . it also produces much more light much brighter than itty bitty book light	-1

i bought this hoping wow my family some 30 minute meals but this doesn't work great my electric stove . if you leave it up too high longer than minute grill side griddle coating burns off stinks up place . if you can't leave it up high you don't get good grill marks . i end up putting high few minutes then back down . doesn't cook thick meat chicken breast through well . you better off finishing them real pan oven . coating chips easily . i am thinking going cast iron it more work begining but i think it worth it long run	-1

if i could give this product 0 stars , i would . read negative reviews , folks , forewarned . i believed positive reviews ignored negative ones , much my exasperation . when i plugged my handsome new oven , little red digital display numbers came right away ... hmmm ... so far so good . but , according instructions , you supposed run oven door open 15 minutes get rid new oven smell . sooo ... owner manual says push " bake " button dashboard , which turn lights pilot lid light display , after which you set " time " " temp " . so i push " bake " button nothing happens , no lid light comes . nothing . zilch . zippo . so i then push " temp " " time " lights try get gerbils wake up . still nothing . i unplugged it plugged it again , thinking maybe somehow i screwed up , while listening " beep " owner manual said should happen whence unit plugged . zilch . zippo . nothing . no " beep " . no " bake " lid light . tried pusing " temp " " time " buttons again . nada . tried unpugging it again doing whole shebang all over again . still nothing . it just sat there grinned me . this time , i figured out my unit also " dead arrival " . least you get parcel paid bill lading printed off amazon website defective product return , saving yourself annoyance prepaying return dead product you already paid now must wait weeks get refund . amazon should take remainder their stock this awful product out back lot their warehouse run them over forklift	-1

hoover past , i excited find this one this price . i've it only year am now vacuum shopping once again - not looking hoovers . parts plastic cheap break easily . it advertised power hand tool . it not . it works air when you put it any material it stops spinning . upright power tool carpets also stopped working after six months . hard wood floor tool worked fine - suction strong enough - but again plastic pieces break attachments don't stay like they should , so i spend most my time vacuum re-attaching pieces . i would recommend looking elsewhere if you want vacuum last	-1
we owned this machine little over two years . first 6 months it worked expected clothes coming out slightly damp due condensation method drying . however , since then , it stopped drying , such 5 hours drying ( yes , 5 hours ) yields wet clothes . this persisted , despite 4 repairs , replacing almost every part machine except control board , which i assume next . prior this machine we owned equator brand washer/dryer combo which disaster : broke after 3 years . unfortunately , lg probably best bunch mediocre machines ( equator , asko , maber other brands ) available us .. all shortcomings dryers all use ventless-condensation method which take much longer dry almost all 115v . bosch combos available europe , but unfortunately not available us , 220v thus , dry more quickly . this not machine family , but rather ideal apartment or condo 1 or 2 people most . when it worked , it worked well . however , no one should invest $1300 it break such short time . no one should spend over 5 hours 1 load laundry . if you must purchase one these machines ( reasons space ) , buy extended warranty	-1

i ordered this machine my wife after reading dozens reviews positive feedback . we followed instructions explicitly created one cup coffee . after machine said " ventilate " . we followed proceedures ventilating machine it seemed correct itself . went make cup coffee it said " ventilate " . this time it would not fix itself . i tried perform ventilate process it would simply spray hot water out into tray . turn off knob " ventilate " comes back up screen . turn machine off turn it back , " ventilate " came up screen . we called amazon they sent us replacement few days later ( thank you amazon ) . unfortunately , this one i not get cup one out machine . it read " ventilate " soon i turned it . difference this one no water would come out all . gaggia provides no customer support so you your own this unit	-1
none other nonsticks hold candle this stuff ! i bought this 8 " fry pan 2 months ago , except bottoms , still looks brand new despite used nearly every day . i even used bacon press ( cast iron ) it every time i cooked bacon couple times i accidently scraped inside side pan no marks left . hubby stacked knives forks inside , then topped it off 6 dinner plates . i thought it -- scratches nicks everywhere , but no , not single mark . my calphalon commercial nonstick ( which hit trash already ) looked like it through war when my 18 yr . old . i must admit , though , i not use metal utensils it , nor i put dishwasher since i won't one til kitchen remodeled . overall , though , just what abuse it gotten , i'm very impressed buy more . my advice ? don't mess rest -- buy best this it . going try wok next . wish they sold electric griddle this stuff it	1

cuts like samurai blade quality , doesn't need steel frequent henckels/ wusthof knives . it excellent weight medium sized hand . however , handles get quite slippery when wet , so keep your hands clean dry while using this knife safety . also , if you plan saving money getting cheaper steel , don't , because this global blade much harder than henckels/wusthof blades ; qood quality diamond coated or ceramic steel must , or if you really like steel design , get global steel which cost quite bit . overall , this good quality knife proper care attention needed , just like samurai would get use his sword	-1

some reviews make it sounds like every ec701 defective out box . so far , i've made 40 shots espresso 10 steamed ciders , i've very pleased product . i've working improving my technique now i think espresso excellent . i prefer my homemade shots stuff i buy starbucks most other cafes , though this could due delusional pride my own amateur baristaship . also , i may over-excited because i'd wanted espresso machine so long . negatives ( so far ) it looks like there fair amount ongoing maintenance cleaning machine , though i doubt this unique this brand . also , others mentioned , espresso spout low , so i drink my coffee out ceramic ramikins ( although aren't low spouts authentic ? ) . also , i haven't gotten steamer working quite right i always end up cappuccinos ( all foam ) even if i'm trying make latte . hopefully i'll get better time . reliability , i've only made 40 shots , so i can't speak long-term quality , but so far , so good . heck , 40 espresso drinks starbucks would've cost me over $120 now , although making it home still isn't free -- if you use convenient pods , it still 50 cents shot , illy beans expensive ( right now , i'm using unground dark-roasted kona , which deep very smooth )	-1
person who loathes cheap , clutter , infomercial widgets i bought this out or sheer curiosity imagining it would returned same day . this opener large , requires electric plug takes up counter space . but my surprise it works amazingly well . there foil cutter stored base . screw enters cleanly seems eliminate broken shredded corks which frustrating . hold button again cork emerges device drops out . i always liked my sturdy simple stainless steel opener . but this turned out keeper . it design contemporary clean , although it looks like it should something more profound than just pull cork . it also conversation piece provoking smiles guests . pleasant surprise , highly recommended especially so person who lacks hand or wrist strength .	1

i baught my 8 " global chef knife 5 years ago . it great use kitchen remains one my favorite knives market . molybdenum/vanadium steel global knives holds edge far longer than its henkles/wustolf counterparts . my only complaint handle design which not suit my gripping style , nor my large hands . i don't mind steel handles , although they contribute slippage some loss grip . my main problem tapered bolster , which almost lack bolster altogether . coupled thin spine heal knife , extended use uncomfortable hand . i highly recommend globals , but i might suggest 8 1/4 " heavyweight model , which appears more standard handle design less tapering bolster . more info knife handling care you might check out cia book titled " professional chef knife kit " . one last comment . although all knife companies like claim their knives dishwasher safe , please , please , don't put your knives dishwasher .	-1

so , espresso machine great . it solidly built very simple design it . i recommend this machine anyone who wants make espresso home would like their machine last more than couple years . it moderately priced -- moderate i mean kind high home system , but definitely not 12 thousand dollars -- it also pretty cool looking . which always bonus . issues i've few number , but i'll give some hints getting your new machine work your liking -- your liking i mean my liking . first , make sure thing stays clean . this especially important when it comes steaming milk . wand needs cleaned quickly , thoroughly , often . try clean machine every 2-3 weeks ( heavy use ) 4-6 weeks ( light use ) espresso machine cleaner . this make steaming milk much easier faster , since you've removed obstacles steam . second , making espresso takes some tinkering . usually , espresso coffee shop run around 140 degrees ( ) . machine , espresso set run around 80-100 degrees , while steaming milk set 140 degrees . simply set machine steam milk , load your shot , steam your milk , run your shot 140 degrees . start counting when espresso starts dropping 17-22 seconds . if you're not content rate or quantity , adjust espresso grind -- more coarse or fine -- increase or decrease rate sho t.t hird , this all aesthetic , but i find i get best espresso vienna or french roast coffee . personally , i love sumatran coffee , but costa rica , papua new guinea , ethiopia , kona ( hawai'i ) close seconds . buy fair trade organic coffee . then enjoy some wicked good espresso . happy coffee drinking ! --	1

i agree daigo others brikka ( i only 2-cup model ) makes really nice caf� , while technically not espresso , very , very tasty . 2-cup model produce crema . david results , it puzzling . if coffee boiling upper chamber , i'd guess not enough pressure building . i would speculate seal chambers not complete . check see if there any grounds breaking seal before you screw them together . if there nothing blocking perfect seal , i'd suspect defect . even if 2-cup model superior 4-cup , i can't imagine functioning 4-cup produce results you're getting	1

okay , so it hard get excited things like hepa filters - or vacuum cleaners other devices they used . when my wife concluded her extensive search replacement our old canister vacuum anointed miele winner , i slightly less enthusiastic than she . it vacuum cleaner . it just tool keeping things trim . after very short while i began understand her admiration design build quality this particular tool . hepa filters bags used no less part this than vacuum itself . if you tire vacuums constantly gritty dust they stir-up but don't quite capture , get miele . if you distain smell emanating your vacuum exhaust , get miele . if you long simple , easy use maintain system even your husband use , get miele . use genuine miele bags , change your hepa filter recommended . difference cost minor , but you amazed difference results	1

i capresso just 2 years ( see my earlier rating . ) it worth it weight gold . coffee terrific .... i no desire stop starbucks way home work my usual evening caffiene fix . customer service terrific . last week steam knob stuck not turn open . since warranty period 1 year over , i concerned spend huge amount get it fixed . i tried cleaning knob(thinking maybe some milk splatters grunge crusted underneath ) , i also tried wd 40 ..... no avail . when i called customer service , i spoke ' gunther ' , who kindly walked me through prying off knob replacing it .... now it works perfectly ! machine operated my 10 12 year olds well my cleaning lady sitter ..... it never failed . reproducible cup coffee .... pretty much each time . rare occasion , coffee luke warm discarded . i learnt machines little nuances tweak settings make perfect cup . i always use whole beans . i found when i use ground coffee i put tremendous amount per cup brewed . i also only used non flavored coffee beans . frother get pretty crusted , so i usually take it apart soak it warm soapy water every other day . occasion , if it not reattached well it pop off while steaming make bit mess , possible scald you .... so careful . happened once or twice , probably why steam knob got stuck dried milk . any rate , jura capresso f7 gets 5 stars me 2 year mark	1
i what you're doing now , read these reviews . my perspective , this single greatest travel mug market . one reviewer mentioned it doesn't stay warm long enough , however my coffee/tea stays respectably warm least hour . usually more . there something truly satisfying tossing full travel mug coffee onto floor your car if you're hurry ... or placing it your backpack classes --- neeever worrying it spilling . pure genius ! my only complaint handle isn't conducive cupholder my mazda 6 . handle extends too far down which causes it get way my center console ... i only stabilize it cupholder if both cupholes empty . but since it leak proof , i no problem setting it seat next me	1

my entire kitchen kitchenaid . i bought this opener three years ago . it awful ... difficult use , shredded paper top can label , very difficult get started . because i love kitchenaid products so much , i assumed this just defective opener , threw it away , bought . second one even worse ! it worked okay first couple times , but now it barely cuts all . it grinds top , making dents , but won't actually make cut . once i get it started , i cannot finish it because it " messes up " pretty badly . this one going garbage well . :	-1
this product seemed like good idea . i mix my own cereal , add lots nuts seeds . so it lot heavier than fruit loops always shown pictures . way holder fits into base not all secure , when full heavy cereal , disaster assured . also , neither top or bottom cover really secure seal , so tipping holder caused top fly off me , some interesting times my dogs cleaning up floor . i hard time taking bottom seal off when my cereal bowl position . if you take it off first , then some cereal leaks out , causing problem i trying solve - namely no cereal laying around my counter inviting unwelcome guests . i tried this product awhile , but threw it trash pretty fast . went back big tupperware container not convenient this could , but no awful spills either	-1

let me describe my floors ... i turn 30 tomorrow . i'm bachelor dog cat . i'm also avid ( messy ) cook i bought hoover my kitchen . floor lightly textured vinyl . my main hobby brewing beer which tends leave lots sticky wort beer floor . side-effect lots drunken people parade through my kitchen which my bar bathroom . it also winter time i've putting sand salt mix walkways . summary , my floors disgusting !! i read instructions today work i couldn't wait get home try my floor mate . it assembled quickly easily . i used dry setting first it actually impressed me . i planning using my normal vacuum , but i too lazy get it out . it also lot quieter than my vacuum ( kenmore model)i set hoover up wet mode . it what it promised- it put down liquid , scrubbed , sucked it up . first , i didn't think it sucking up wetness much i would hoped ; but i rinsing out floor mate ( which quick easy ) , i turned around find 90% floor already bone dry . i cleaning out wet container- wow ! water jet black dirt . well , it taken me few minutes write this , so let me check results ... floor 99.99% dry immaculate ! it hasn't clean , since ... well , ever ! i one complaint- container you put solution could bigger . i ran out just before finishing kitchen ( it pretty small ) . luckily brushes wet enough finish job . i love my floor mate ! thank you hoover ! all writers bad reviews- i think you need read your manual .	1

buy something else . first all , it started out fine - good suction , etc . there only one flaw dusting wand didn't work . it supposed charge clean itself , but only happens if you keep thing together , i bet you can't . it doesn't take long power paw stop working . mine rotates so slowly if it touches anything it stops . cleaner itself loses suction over time . dust catcher easy empty , but don't forget buy all filters it needs . this poor choice	-1
i've wanted dyson long time , but me spending over $400 vacuum seemed little extreme . well , not anymore . i finally took plunge ordered dyson dc07 all floors last week ( . . penny ) . it arrived today it only took me ten minutes assemble it . i don't know what other posters referring when they say it complicated assemble . all i put hose together pull off few pieces tape . then i put dyson test . i 400 square foot apartment bathroom downstairs . most my apartment thick shag carpet except kitchen which tiled floor . bathroom floor cement thin pile carpet over top it . dyson handled it all without making sound . i've read reviews here say vacuum make terrible racket thick carpets it suck up lot carpet fiber . my dyson neither . i stairs leading down bathroom which also carpeted . i sat dyson downstairs bathroom ( per instructions which say put dyson lowest floor when vacuuming stairs ) i used floor/carpet attachment end wand stairs . not only i able vacuum entire stairs , but because length wand i able turn entire apparatus around vacuum risers well . this something i could never my former vacuum , least not very well . i bit worried using hose dyson quick pick ups dusting , because there other reviewers here who say suction diminishes when using hose and/or attachments . let me just say not case all . top my kitchen cabinets i old bottles , baskets , assorted antiques sitting up there since i moved four years ago . i only tried vacuuming up there couple occasions two vacuums i used failed miserably two regards - 1 ) their hoses could never reach , 2 ) they could not adequately remove dust ( which kind resembles grizzly bear fur ) . dyson excelled this task . i no problem reaching hose up there ( brush attachment ) one pass vacuum sucked up layers dust like finger scooping frosting off cake . length this hose stretch astounds me , i tell while using it it made extremely well last long time . gone days using cheap vacuums equally cheap hoses . hoo-rah ! now far emptying canister keeping it clean this not daunting task some claimed . i able remove canister dump dirt one simple move . also , if you gently tap side shroud while it over trash you dislodge lot dirt debris caught up inside it . i not taken dust bin assembly apart yet any thorough cleaning , but i reckon it no more difficult than cleaning out my sewing machine after every project . i found lot complaints here could rectified simply reading manual . it very detailed ( pictures even ) there even 800 number dyson support . all all i'm giving this vacuum five stars it stellar performance . it handled all cleaning tasks ease filters solid construction chassis hose i don't think i'll ever need buy vacuum again . my final word ; there should picture this vacuum next word phenomenal dictionary	1
my life , i used lot syrup dispensers , most which poorly designed leaked . this one neither . i really love way this dispenser works . top nicely designed executed out brushed stainless , gasket seals tightly . no-drip spout indeed no-drip us . even our 10 year old can't make it drip , that saying something . glass container larger than it looks since glass goes all way top handle , inside lid . my only wish they made one bit bigger could hold full bottle real maple syrup .	-1

just note , you get this book free when you sign up take wilton cake class course 1 ( least you michael arts crafts where i took mine ) book easy understand , pictures literally step step include instruction such " offhand , " meaning it tell you something should resemble ice cream cone or look like behive , swirl here , or lightly brush here , sweeping motion , etc . i found it very refreshing not all spoken terms only people who attended culinary school would understand . it also shows you pictures suggested supplies you need beginning book so your not running back store each time you start new segment . i would suggest just taking class because top getting book free , you get lot more tips advice instructor you jot down ample space imbetween pictures notes book . but if you too busy or there isn't class scheduled near you , this book would certainly suffice helping you get started	1
i gone through several deep fryers over past few years my quest find perfect deep fryer . t-fal fr7008002 ultimate ez clean hands down best i found date . pros : so easy clean ! most unit dishwasher safe , which great plus me . thing i hated deep fryers before cleaning oil system . either inner pot would not removable ( days when deep fryers first came out started become popular ) , or pot would full junk food it would hard pour out filter oil . also , where store oil ? this unit makes it so easy clean reuse oil . it great job filtering out junk floated into oil frying neatly storing it into storage container . it time someone came out product like this ! cons : it use lot oil , so you buy big gallons costco or warehouse type place . good thing , though , ease reusing oil , so it doesn't make it seem too bad use amount oil . also , i wish oil would heat higher than 378 degrees . i didn't get out cooking thermometer actually see if oil heated temp , but it would nice if oil got hotter . i understand it home use not professional , so there safety factor , but frying higher temperature fries ensures crispy-on-the-outside-and-tender-on-the-inside-not-oily fry . overall , i love this deep fryer , so i gave it five , even though it few things it could improve upon	1

we drinkwell fountain more than two years after recent birth our first child cross-country move , found we become overly lax giving it thorough cleaning . primary reason this cleaning very difficult -- it almost impossible get every little nook cranny . plus plastic drinkwell made out seemed get grungy very easily almost absorb minerals thanks hard water our new home . i little apprehensive catit fountain after reading few reviews , but thought we would give it try . first thing we noticed while assembling we really liked water filtered * before * it returns pump ( drinkwell , it filtered after going through pump , which leads gunkier pump ) . it also very quiet , so you don't get " running water " sound ( drinkwell ) occasionally led us search open tap before we realized it fountain . some people mentioned difficulty seating reservoir so water flows over dome properly . we experience this after cleaning fountain , but quickly discovered we just needed move pump bit one side allow secure fit . large reservoir , we also enjoy able go approximately week refills two thirsty cats , instead refilling daily ( we not purchase drinkwell optional reservoir ) . it also very easy see if water level getting low . one note : i haven't observed either cat actually licking water dome i sure our little female would love this since she drink faucet . overall , i like this fountain better . it looks kind cool , it takes up smaller footprint , quieter , easier fill easier clean than our old fountain . we not purchase mat , zero problems spilling or splashing . we give drinkwell fountain my sister-in-law since it still working order her kitty enjoying it thus far	1

i semi-skeptical this would work but i am sucker red kitchen items . i didn't actually buy this until i saw it person local kitchen store because i wasn't sure how it worked . you soften two sticks butter , put them into top part pot which like upside-down cup , then invert place bottom part . course you need little bit water bottom create seal keeps your butter fresh . then place anywhere unrefrigerated butter soft spreadable whenever you want it . no more hard butter toast ! realy important part change water every couple days -- i make it part my morning routine when i am kitchen making coffee -- takes only 5 seconds . your butter not stay fresh indefinetely , however . after month even fresh water i got some mold pot . pot nearly empty time what left fell out into water . not big deal since i typically go through all butter faster than month time , so i've only seen this happen once . after butter used up , i wash butter pot ( it dishwasher safe ) fill up again . wish i this years ago ! red great shade , it matches my cherry red le creuset poterie dishes nicely	1

starting positive : this thing well-made holds plenty whatever you intend put into it . very strong , it doesn't even begin show strain even while forcing through even toughest doughs . most my tubes fit fine , except smallest largest them . only real negative , outside fact it doesn't work all my tubes , fatty or oily things leak through canvas , i wind up hands covered grease can't grip anything properly . it would nice see plastic lining inside bag , which would prevented this problem . so , really , good product , but not good enough 5 stars	-1

i used amazon.com search feature night light uses led instead conventional incandescent bulb because like all incandescents , they prone burning out relatively short time . i also liked idea leds generate far less heat consume less power than incandescent bulb.amazon.com search results listed maxxima mln-10 i ordered four them . i'm very satisfied appearance , quality , features , light output . i like adjustability able rotate two lenses light output also reversing base when night light plugged orient daylight sensor either up or down socket sensitivity . nice ! only advertised feature i think differs slightly product description light output only slightest bluish tint mostly white light . it still subdued enough so not too bright so this fine me	1

i bought this item when i replace my microwave i hoping reduce ' microwave smell ' - funky tomato sauce smell blows out microwaves after too many spatters . you clean out microwave , but you can't clean behind vent grids , where splatters go live forever , pungent biomass . so i figured food would blow out vent hole cover splat roof my oven , but reduce problem . we use oven mostly reheating melting . this cover exceeded my expectations . 1 . it fits my tiny sharp r-209kk 800 watt oven - bit overhang but it never fallen off platter . 2 . no discernable splatters even roof my oven , which i wipe out every day ! steam vent ( not finger hole ) top releases pressure top where steam rises . even pyrex casseroles glass lids not good because pressure builds , lid lifts steam , they shoot hot liquid all directions . 3 . food cooks better . we used use paper towel , or dish cover food . here food cooks moist environment doesn't ' explode ' much because steam regulation clever top vent . paper towel would always slide off or sink into food cook into food let food blast out edges . 4 . cover doesn't get very dirty . i guess because food explodes less it easy clean dunking my dishpan rinsing . nothing baked onto this lid . 5 . food keeps better . if it cooking , i leave food microwave because lid keeps it drying out . 6 . it works great taller containers still fit under circle . i rubbermaid microwave containers 5 inchers tall 5x5 inches base . i set this lid top container . vent hole keeps contents blowing protects oven . hole top not finger hole . use pot holders remove anything microwave . defensive . it only takes one mishap land surprise burn . never assume spot safe touch . i note comments breakage . i wonder if dishwasher heat ? i find rigid plastic dishes cannot take hot water treatment without becoming brittle , often become opaque crack , so i am hand washing which easy because it hardly gets dirty . dunk , swipe , rinse . i saw cheap chinese imitations . i stick american made plastics food prep save job too . nordic ware great innovative companyand hey , if your food piled higher than cover you need something else .	1

this must rank one greatest kitchen " appliances " ever invented . idea so simple , it wonder it not used more . essentially , this crock-pot cooks food it own . you boil stuff stove 10 minutes , then you remove pot flame set it insulated sleeve ; when you get back office , voila , dinner ready . we've cooked ratatouille , lentil soup , curry , vegetable stew , many other items . fact , many ways , this pot produces better food than if you left it stove few hours : 1 : - potatoes other vegetables don't disintegrate even after hours sitting , because there no constant boiling 2 : - vitamins not boiled out food ( apparently ) , certainly flavor better preserved 3 : - color retained 4 : - time you're ready eat , temperature just right , not scalding . top this , it much safer : you " cook " leave house . we also use thermal sleeve ice bucket wine cooler . whole unit perfect " pot luck " dinners ; we brought over thanksgiving veggies this way last year . finally , course , this product wonder saving energy ! inner pot deep , thick bottom , holds lot ; it not flimsy so not scald places directly under flame . it seems made special stainless steel retains heat much more than average . this product deserves 10 stars -	1

this coffee maker just what i looking , but considerably more money i wanted spend coffee pot , after reading all reviews here amazon , i convienced go ahead pull trigger . all i really say $300 i really expected more . if i paid $30 walmart it , it would trash now , but after blowing half truck payment it i am stuck least trying make it work . first , grinder seems keep getting plugged up . while grinder runs alloted amount time , beans not fall hopper into grinder so less than enough beans end up ground into basket , you get watered down coffee . second , basket supposed swing over grinding station brewing station after grinding complete . it just doesn't enough spring power make trip stops just short which means hot brewed coffee split pot , counter . i am what i consider good consumer . i compare prices extent , but quality what i am after if i find good product , i spend $$ get best . i say i caught off gaurd this time . if i hadn't already discarded box packing i would sending it back . after rereading above reviews i must really doing something wrong . good luck	-1

i purchased this espresso maker 2-1/2 months ago . i used it 2-3 times per week . my first disappoinment frothing wand . not only it placed place which it difficult get mug milk or water cleaning without first sloshing some counter . second , shape style wand all frothing itself . if i wanted automatic frother i'd bought something cheaper . this allows no proper room style . someone who not operated professional barista this may fine , but i prefer more control over how much what type foam i create , thus i purchased " nicer machine " or so i thought . most part i am pleased espresso itself . i most often get healthy creme , when i don't i'm sure it operator error ( improper tamping or whatever ) . one week ago i made latte left run some errands . i returned find all my incoming outgoing mail sopping wet . perplexed i took good look around counter , noticed water carafe my espresso maker empty . i always fill it after making last latte remembered doing so before i left . i absolutely no idea how this managed get cracked . i called customer service delonghi requested replacement . i not asked many questions item shipped no charge , however - they tell me it won't arrive 5-8 weeks . meantime , i am only able put enough water tank make one latte . i thought this machine last me years , but now i am wondering how long it really hold out .	-1
preliminary review : i just used aeropress second time am very happy it . i've read reviews here [ ... ] effusive they , i one over-riding concern : would coffee too bland not strong enough ( slight bitter kick ) my taste ? i like coffee black strong ; always always . , good espresso heavenly . therefore all reviews how " smooth " aeropress coffee made me wary . i like touch bitterness distrusted . 170 degree recommended water temperature . anyways , espresso came out nice thick , very full-bodied rich . there also very nice combination enough acid heavy , rich taste experience . complexity some good beans came through , perhaps even enhanced over my good french press . i'm delighted . i'll come back expand when i've used this bit more , but now i highly recommend aeropress assure those who may similar concern hand-press won't deliver " real espresso " : it . one more word : there real crema if one firmly pumps down inch or two air top grounds . quality crema just so-so , ( light , no distinction ) but it there . professional espresso machine works 130psi ( 9-10 bars/atmospheres ) get crema everyone loves ; one thing , far i tell , only thing , out reach aeropress .	1
i purchased this specifically because i looking small spoon rest reviewer commented this could only hold tablespoon . i slightly dissapointed find this standard sized spoon holder easily holds mixing spoons , wisks , etc . only reason someone would difficulty using this intended if they weren't watching what they doing . large spatula only utensil may not rest snuggly holder ... though it could easily rest top you would most spoon holders . anyone looking holder accomidates any size or shape utensil should search using key word ' spoon rest ' - traditional spoon shaped holders , this also returns holders/rests tend wide flat so utensils placed anywhere it without much thought . this product also quite attractive looks much nicer than run-of-the-mill white ceramic , stainless steel , or country themed holders found most department stores .	-1
i've my electric skillet approximately 2 years . i love way it cooks easy cleanup . i only used it maximum 7 times when i noticed there spot seemed stuck surface pan . i looked more closely discovered there 2 " square area where nonstick coating just rubbed off . i always very careful way i handle this skillet ( no metal utensils , hand wash , no excessive heat . ) i bought it really good sale price , but i think i should able get more than 7 uses before it destroyed cooking surface	-1
this one my best christmas memories , making krumkake my mom . it take while since each cookie made individually . however , it totally worth wait . cookies crisp sweet . i would much rather make them using stove top method not new electric krumkake makers . i remember concentrating getting them just right amount ... my mom watching . we would listen christmas music talk we worked . i guess some memories should not messed	1
i really like this design . it slight raised lip running around outside edge which contains any batters , grease , or other liquids which might run over edge create mess ; grease drain only front edge treated same sturdy non-stick coating rest surface , making easy clean up . indeed , lack plastic attachments make cleanup easy , i really like simple design , very large cooking surface , two plastic handles removable plastic grease catch . only thing keeping me rating it five out five i would liked see thicker aluminum used , base only 2mm thick , though i've unable find anything thicke	-1

so others not make mistake i , i am writing this review . this cookware performed well two years . however , we large family put it dishwasher regularly . it 5 years this cookware not stood up regular use . not mistake kitchen essentials professional cookware . now when we cook mashed potatoes , we not know if potatoes peppered or just flaking teflon . all pieces used daily now un-coated aluminum . outside cookware chalky appearance . i am sure this dishwasher . we used plastic utensils most time , but you know how it when you hurry feed kids . my recommendation spend money high quality stainless steel cookware . we recently purchased calphalon tri-ply so far we really pleased . stainless steel cleans up easily , or least easy kitchen essentials . money , go stainless you never purchase cookware again .	-1

i bought this amazon.com right after holidays . i must say i leary after reading negative reviews . however , it one few push-down button toaster like our old black decker . when i received toaster i carefully thoroughly read through instructions . we burned toast first couple slices , but after we adjusted it good setting good results since then . i also baked some homemade fries it they came out fine . after looking stores numerous models , we turn black decker aside due very loud timer their models . too bad , because we liked their other features , but couldn't stand loud " neverland " ticking timer . we settled oster 6235 because smaller footprint , sleek style , i said before , separate toaster button . yes , it get hot top it should given space around it - any toaster oven should . if you read directions thoroughly before operating , remembering turn rack over toast ( it raises it slightly higher bottom burner element ) turn it back over other cooking you shouldn't any problems . like all toaster ovens , they aren't best toast . if you want great piece toast , buy toaster specific job . however , all-around type 2nd oven , this good job . just make sure you watch it carefully first few times use so you learn adjust its cooking habits . it not toy small children should not able reach it during operation .	-1

while not first come market powered scrubber[as seen tv]this scrubber much more solid feel than its competition without * too * hefty . it geared so there sufficient torque allow some serious scrubbing ability remove any remaining teflon your non-stick pot or pan . if you know difference pot or pan * , this gadget made just you . i would strongly suggest using rechargeable batteries rather then start cycle use refuse ameliorating long term impact environment your wallet[or purse ] . so why not five stars ? two reasons .... first , tired hospital color scheme just attractive today it 50 years ago . yech ! course , if you still any appliances bygone era , you remain completely coordinated satisfying even most severe case ocd . second , only two scrubbing pads ???? yes , they different grades " scratchless ? " , but including least one replacement set wouldn't send bd stock into downward spiral , would it ? i would strongly suggest ordering extra set pads [ no , unlike bd other scrubbers , these pads exclusive this model only ] your purchase . this product even remotely neccesary ? no ! but you know what they say woman her toys . . . er . . . d'oh!i've got this sinking feeling couple months i'll writing review new porter-cable " power sponge " , men finally begin experiencing joy receiving something clean next christmas ! apparently revenge dish best served cleaned . ax ~ *hint : you * handle * it ?	-1

i started out magnalite aluminum pans bride too many years ago . 20 years later those pitted relics went goodwill replaced calphalon anodized aluminum non-stick interiors . they lasted perhaps 10 years before non-stick started flake off . i wanted stainless steel : dishwasher safe , virtually non-destructable , etc . so , search began . revereware , like my mother still uses after almost 60 years , much more flimsy than it used . farberware ? non-stick or not ? one could practically buy house price high end stainless , though it certainly built last long . i would occasionally check houseware stores , amazon other websites looking good , reasonably priced stainless cookware . imagine my extreme good luck when this cookware came sale , there no shipping deal $25 off purchase boot ! i should bought lottery ticket day ! cuisinart chef classic set showed up less than week . i unpacked all pans lids , washed them up put them cupboard . all other pans went way magnalite . although manufacturer says handwashing best , they go into dishwasher come out bright shiny . creature habit , i still use sos scouring pads remove stains polish metal bit . manufacturer not recommend this , nor they recommend use metal utensils . saucepans starting show wisk marks , but shows these pans used loved . lids fit well saucepans i don't boil-overs like i used . plan following instructions relating low heat start-ups ; these pans get hot quickly hold heat very well . i still use my old , reliable cast iron frying pans frying foods , but frying pans saute pan good items pantry . all lids interchangeable according size . i am very pleased . cookware set superior what i before deal through amazon incredible .	1
i'm not fan how enormous wine glasses restaurants these days but these glasses seem like perfect size ( although still larger than glasses we upgrading ! ) . i like they modern shape feel high-quality . although intended white wine , inward curve lid subtle enough i feel comfortable serving red wine them well . major downside they large enough they don't fit upright top rack non-adjustable dishwasher . we quickly broke one trying wash them precarious angle learned our lesson	-1

i'm fan spanish-made henckel int'l classic lines . i bread knife utility knife well . i think major budget concessions ( these not high-end german-made line ) comes size . classic blades , though full-tang thrice-riveted , less steel than comparable brands . this makes them slender light hand . however , less steel not lower-quality steel , these blades incredibly hard reliable . this santoku still large enough use spatula when cutting , delivering onions , mushrooms or other slices or mince pan while cooking speedily . it sharpens easily ( i use small stone under running water ) , responds well steel every few uses . it sharpest blade my collection , easily slicing up my sponges when i clean it . care , it won't same your skin , mostly because sturdiness construction breeds confident handling . it won't slide off most vegetables before slicing , even cleave small poultry bones slow steady pressure downward ( i wouldn't use it hack real cleavers ) . this precision instrument , not blunt tool	-1

i looking crockpot wasn't too large wasn't too expensive . this product fit bill . lid treated glass so , you see food cooking without lifting lid . lid handle stays cool during cooking , so you won't burn your fingers if you touch it . ceramic cooker sturdy alittle heavy . it become slippery when wet , so careful while washing it sink . also careful because handles cooker metal base become very hot during cooking . so keep potholders nearby . cooker accomodate 3.5 -4 pound whole chicken 4 pound roasts . it oval shape enables these foods fit well . it comes small instruction manual includes some recipes . so far , i've cooked whole grain cereal ( barley cracked wheat ) , stews , whole chickens , corned-beef , turkey legs . they've turned out good . however , since i'm new slow-cooking , first attempts abit off because i cooked food too long . but now , i'm better timing so food better . just side note , if you like eating whole grain cereals , slow cooker terrific . you don't need stand over stove stirring pot worrying it boil over . this cooking method allows grains fully absorb water , which makes creamier end result . plus , you toss grains water into cooker bedtime it time your breakfast . i two very minor complaints : 1 . packaging . cooker packaged way you slide it out box . if you aren't careful , you could drop ceramic cooker or glass lid . 2 . handle lid alittle loose , could made tighter 1 turn . but might not design flaw , but way compensate expansion glass during cooking process . so , don't mess it , im o.o therwise this great product	1

i never owned nice pepper mill . i've always used red box , recently plastic low-quality mill constant battle use properly . i enough wanted nice mill . but shopping amazon.com pepper mills difficult task since there literally hundreds choose . after shopping pepper mill month i decided this mill because beautiful wood , competitive pricing . alternatively , i consider few battery-operated mills . but end i preferred warm inviting look natural wood instead cold metallic looking mills . i choose cherry wood over maple thinking cherry more durable would resist dings scratches heavy use . perhaps better point cherry grain ever so slightly darker than maple pictures . i preferred darker grain . after my order , i didn't receive any order tracking information amazon.com . i wrote email brentwood mills , they responded very quickly . my pepper mill arrived week good packaging . let me say short after it few weeks i absolutely love this pepper mill . brentwood mills a+ company . but let me give you details . when mill arrived , i opened inspected it like anyone would . unfortunately , there very small factory defect - chip near bottom inside where ground pepper exists . it not visible exterior very , very small . my best guess boring bit into solid piece wood caused it . i wrote brentwood mills back asking them if this normal or truly defect . they responded quickly indicating it very rare mill leaves their factory less than perfect shape . they mentioned 3 quality checkpoints ensure high quality control . but course , they offered exchange it me their cost if it bothered me . i decided live it week see . wood beautiful even imperfections . integrity , beauty , effectiveness mill a+ despite minor chip . after week though , i decided go ahead exchange because ultimately brentwood qc should caught this unit . i didn't think it unreasonable considering price range . i wrote brentwood back let them know i returning exchange , they very invitingly assured me they would take care me . they then emailed me few days later when they received sent out new mill . replacement mill arrived within week again well packed . inspecting mill showed absolutely no visible defects all . it beautiful example cherry wood . i filled mill peppercorns proceeded use it . it amazing how high quality mill churn out pepper . i tried coarse , finely ground both worked extremely well . grind setting small knob top you manually adjust your liking . crank feels very good my hand , just outstanding . each half-crank mill puts out little less than eighth teaspoon pepper my very unscientific measurement . once you finish mill set it down , no left over ground pepper leaks out . this seems indicate very high quality mill . certainly bonus not pepper crumbs making mess . i absolutely love this mill . fact , my only complaint my wife who says i'm putting too much pepper everything . very minor annoyance filling peppermill peppercorns . because metal spine middle mill must remain centered it somewhat difficult put corns around it . i couple kitchen funnels which made job little easier . but it might nice if brentwood made custom funnel help hold metal spine place during refill . but i think this limitation this type mill you would find anywhere . end i'm extremely satisfied my purchase . wood very lovely my kitchen my table . brentwood mills great company a+ customer service . highly recommend .	1

le creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels well other products . le creuset casts these cooking vessels molten iron poured sand moulds used only once . this reason , one pot may look like , but each unique its own way . cast iron highly efficient material which absorbs distributes heat efficiently . it recommended cooking cast iron low medium heat . there exceptions like boiling water where cooking high heat appropriate okay . remove cast iron heat it not cool off quickly . this helps your food stay warm while serving . beware ; iron tends heavy so these cooking vessels tend heavy well . cast iron effective material cooking so why cover it enamel ? iron tends rust ; iron oxide ( rust ) doesn't add any complimentary flavors your food . if your cast iron cooking vessel not enameled , you would season maintain your cooking vessel . adding porcelain enamel not only looks good , but multiple benefits . enamel , solid coating , one most hygienic surfaces cook , not stain , absorb odors , retain flavors , easy clean . enamel damaged , so limit cooking tools plastic or wood . benefits cooking le creuset cast iron many , but lets get down buffet casserole specifically . 2 1/4 quarts not lot space when it comes casseroles , so consider your recipes when determining size you need . buffet casserole tend best if least 3/4 full . any less you may overwhelm your food heat evenly dispersed pot . large flat bottom curves up this pan resembles curved sided saute pan only thing missing would long handle . tight fitting lid mostly flat curved sides . this lid seals heat , moisture , flavors used hold your meat while you making sauce drippings . its shape design makes this extremely versatile pan . i tend cook large amounts so this pan usually used side dishes desserts . but once you get past basic functionality lends itself recipes such paella , cous cous , basic casseroles , you really open up possibilities . keep mind this 2 1/4 quart pan , 8 inch diameter . this may pan families 2-4 . some possibilities this pan besides casseroles include frittatas , dinner rolls , pepsi chicken wings , mac-n-cheese , baked squash , shrimp scampi , cobblers , pies , pineapple upside down cake , or bread pudding . possibilities almost seem endless . one feature people tend complain cost . cost seem steep compared other pans made other materials . heck , cast iron doesn't seem like it should expensive when comparing old cast iron pan past generations used cornbread camping . however manufacturing process requires making mould each every pan produced . they then go through enameling process before shipping these heavy pans . if you take what goes into making distributing these high quality cast iron products , cost tends make sense . then consider this pan easily last lifetime when taken care . pros : extremely versatileefficient absorption distribution heathygienic enamel cooking surfacedoes not stain , absorb odors , or retain flavorseasy clean when not abused or misusedcan transferred stove top oven tablecan easily last lifetimecons : its heavy , cast iron tends weighing 6 pounds	1

i purchased turquoise sunflower while back just recently ordered cobalt cinnabar . i loved this carafe especially when serving weekend brunches -- even just my family four . we feel fancy using different fiestawares -- really special my 5-year old . i use this water , orange juice , or whatever kind juice you want . it just makes table little more festive . only thing i surprised when i got this i thought it would little bigger . other than , it absolutely beautiful i don't mind it more colors than i already	1

picked this up few weeks ago when it first showed up because my old space heater very noisy fan , no thermostat auto-shutoff . it saw its first use over last few days when i intentionally kept thermostat home heating bit low , turned this specific room occupied . not bad - warms up quickly , oscillates smoothly , accurate sensor ( double checked against oregon sci . homewide system ) changes temperature medium-sized room reasonably quickly . also very quick turn off when it reaches right temperature ( its proximity least , doesn't guarantee it heated entire room set temp , course - compensate setting it degree or two higher ) . forcing it make up around 2-3 degree delta below my comfort zone ( homewide setting kept 2-3 lower than i'd like ) , this stayed barely 20-25% time kept me comfortable 12x18ish room medium-high ( 10 foot ) ceilings . fan noise somewhat noticeable ... since this room my ( above ground ) basement level serves my home theatre/office ... but it isn't too loud me fall asleep . ymmv ! price i got it ( under 40 ) , not bad ! current price , it wash , noise sensitive folks may want consider oil-filled radiator style heaters instead	-1

i put this horrific task -- eliminate stench seven dead mice who suicided themselves en masse full tub stored bath water small bathroom . it worked after day or two ; or their odor dissipated over time , or because i opened window ? i'm not sure which but suspect latter there room fragrance sticks eminated ( until i removed them ) noticeable scent previously pleasing , now forever associated dead mice . just me , but i wouldn't buy , because it really ugly , not unless until someone explain physics it my satisfaction . plus , i don't think it works all odors , dead mice one worst imaginable . burn some incense , or spray water infused fragrance , or open ( but not necessarily light ) some scented candles , or stud orange cloves then sprinkle cinnamon hang , instead . it possible textures area you trying rid odor may affect viability any particular product , well general ventilation . my case , it could inadequately sealed wood walls , lots cloth , minimal cross ventilation . not mention mice ! my hunch this product limited use best -- i am open proven wrong always willing learn . if it works cat boxes , good , but so other things less expensive , candles much prettier	-1

i'm big target shopper , but i've never very impressed their furniture . i couple night stands guest bedroom i regret buying now ( but $60 each i don't know what i expected ) . but lately it seems target starting add more quality furniture their selection . we bought two bookshelves this dresser their shabby chic line i am very impressed detail workmanship . most part , it sturdy beautiful . exception dresser hardware ( drawer pulls ) . mentioned several times other reviews , they break easily . particulary when used rambuctious six-year-old bedroom . also , when my husband first took all pieces out box start putting it together , he realized there two left sides instead one left one right . he'd already put some it together so we didn't want take it back target exchange it , so he called manufacturer . they wouldn't anything it unless he receipt . well , one things i love shopping target whenever i return or exchange , i just give them credit card i used pay it they scan find proof purchase . this way i don't hang bunch receipts . other words , i already thrown away receipt this dresser . my husband called them again few days later explained situation they finally agreed send right side panel . other than this little set back , i guess it came together ok . my husband always puts furniture together i didn't hear lot cuss words or yelling coming my daughter room while he working it . but then , he very patient guy actually enjoys putting stuff together . when all said , after shopping around comparing other pieces other stores their prices similar dressers , this one still worth what we paid it . i eventually replace broken knob ( course , i'll replace them all so they'll match ) - but that no-brainer . i don't even need my hubby .	-1

this little heater works well ! snap-down wheels made it very easy install ( no assembly required ) . thermostatic variable control works well ( unlike some others i tried ) . some reviewers reported smelling oil or paint smell when they first turned it , however , i not issue all . since i only obtained my heater end this years heating season , i haven't yet fully tested high heat setting , but low setting , it kept my 20 14 foot room quite comfortable this spring . it makes no noise i able tell , except very slight click when heater turns thermostat setting	-1
i this almost month now i am very impressed extra comfort cushion this added bed . i little concerned it might flatten out lose its padding but so far it feels same it new . very happy this purchase i ordered second one	1
i bought fiestaware cobalt butter dish while living arizona . butter sold there packaged shorter , wider , higher sized sticks . so , it didn't fit into butter dish unless i trimmed it !! couldn't figure it out , why would they make butter dish stick butter won't fit into ??!! so .... just moved houston area , guess what , butter here sized just right dish . maybe they need make two different sizes west east coast butter ?? crazy ! nice butter dish , though	-1
what say ? this cheap carpet sweeper , it works great ! main sweeper unit well constructed metal it very sturdy indeed . however , handle 4-piece tubular thingee marginal best . handle 4 sections so it shipped smaller box . sweeper works perfectly my office carpet , i stow it away small file cabinet . i recommend this sweeper occasional use , but i would suggest fabricating solid piece tubing better handle if you intend use this more frequent sweeping . otherwise , 4-piece handle keep falling apart your hands .	-1
although it doesn't mention it , these hepa filters also fit hamilton beach air cleaner model 04152 . i email hamilton beach find out , but they very helpful responded right away . when filters arrived amazon , i saw box it says " fits models 04162 , 04163 04152 . " our cat houseful antiques , we always seem dust bunnies floating around . i run this model our office , under table which holds computer . since placing it there i noticed buildup dust around modem almost entirely eliminated . i placed larger model our living room it certainly doing its job . regular settings louder than expected , but i leave them " whisper quiet " setting when we're room i don't even notice them . i would definitely recommend hamilton beach air cleaners	1
absolutely lovely country charming added wonderful factor quot ; oven/microwave table ! quot ; very pleasing	1
i ordered this product amazon last year . so far i am happy this product no problem . its my daily usage baking stuff . i like feature switch broil/oven without flip baking item . love temp control when broil . i gave it 4 star because i hate control knob . they should make it more visible so i know where knob . i consider it good product	-1

i've my popper 10 years rightn now , this thing still works great . pops most kernals , bit sensative first . once you get know your microwave this , works well everytime . i this my dorm room it saved me bundle not buy bags popcorn . highly recommended .	1
i waffling 2 stars 3 stars because this isn't horrible product ... but it could alot better minor modifications . positive side : unit arrived time . it heats up quickly . it produces lots steam . mop window attachments worked particularly well . negative side : i supposed able download product manual but file defunc t.t he soap dispensor attachment not work inititially . ( i disassembled it fixed problem 5 minutes .. but it still pain . product overview included " internal cord storage " it not this feature . ( i assume they refer manually spooling cord around casters caddy storage " internal cord storage " but it misleading best . product overview reported " easy use rotary dial " i still no i dea what refers . there no water level gauge help you know how much water left machine/ or when it close " full " when filling i t.t he shoulder strap system awkward . product lightweight , however carrying product over your shoulder so it constantly hits you thigh annoying ( it would much more convenient able carry it like backpack . this would deman dramatically different design . there no pressure guage or way knowing when unit " safe enough open up ... " ( there just sticker reminds user wait 15 minutes after unplussing machine before opening it refill it .... oh yes ... make sure user " depress hold steam release trigger " make sure tank isnt pressurized before opening tank . -- course unit not steam release trigger ... it electronic switch which only works if unit plugged . this creates saftey hazzard because if you unplug unit wall wait 15 minutes .... there still alot hotwater/steam/ pressure tank . if you click electronic switch open ( nothing happens because unit unplugged ) you may assume unit safe open thus release all pent up steam which puts you risk nasty hand burn . i agree previous reviewers ordering extra supplies mop heads soap inconvenien t.t he machine perform it primary function ( cleaning ) well ... but deficiencies product design , misleading advertising , plus poor documentation/ difficulty reodering supplies all compel me recommend looking other steam cleaning option	-1
love this flannel construction . i concerned since it priced so low , but they wonderful . i love quality construction upon washing there no shift or shrink . buy many , this price you not able replace it ! you also see my review cleopatra this same collection . we ordered both figuring this price , it would worth gamble ! it !!!! there no gamble all .	1

first , i totally agree other reviewers ' raves . i kind spooked so many negative reviews similar products , so i am very happy i bought this brand model . it washable too ! lowest setting perfect overnight after warming bed up higher setting . now i use just light comforter over me instead heavy , constricting blankets . i often overnight hot flashes so periodically throw off covers . this nice warm pad underneath , my bed remains cozy when flash ends i'm cold again . bravo - highly recommended only $60 too . winner !	1
biggest damn spice rack i've ever seen ! no kidding , this thing huge	1

i wasn't certain if she would like this toy or not , but she absolutely loves it . she chases it all over house up walls ( or tries anyway ) . one small problem it , which isn't much problem all , my dogs don't care it all . advertising said dogs like it , but mine couldn't care any less . which actually good thing since cat dogs would fighting over it if they all liked it . short , perfect getting your cat some much needed excercise	1

after reading some reviews here , i concerned buying this cleaner , even though it seemed exactly what i looking replace my expired 1974 model eureka electric broom ( brand loyalty lead me look eureka , but unfortunately , company bought sold several times , they no longer make quality product they when i purchased my electric broom . ) i visited my local independent vacuum dealer i used past keeping my eureka going all these years ; when he informed me he couldn't get parts rebuild motor ; i asked his recommendation , he endorsed hoover flair . when i voiced my concern breaking housing , he showed me how problem area reinforced - i mean plastic tapers 1 " thick this point . hoover now owned maytag , they concerned making quality product . based upon , strength evidenced thickness plastic this area , i laid my fears rest bought machine . vacuum performs excellently both carpet bare floors - i like fact there no metal nozzle scratch my hardwood floors ; it also handles cat hair cat litter ease . summary , i recommend this cleaner wholeheartedly !!	1
problem bachelor if you standard coffee maker own typical 12-cup coffee pot , you make least four cups coffee make decent tasting pot coffee . which means you consume two cups throw out other two . i didn't like idea wasting coffee . while i stopping dunkin cup but i realized approach wasn't frugal solution problem . i've looking ideal single-cup coffee maker solution few years . i decided try this one out after review well-known consumer magazine . most part , it works well . it doesn't take up huge amount counter space . it intitally brewed weak cup coffee . i experiemented amounts coffee discovered if you doubled up amount coffee , it brew flavorful cup coffee . also ( despite what instructions say ) use very warm or hot water tap . contact time heating element not sufficient get water hot enough extract all flavor components your coffee . thus you get weak tasting cup coffee this unit . also if you grind your own coffee , i recommend finer grind this machine it brews too quickly can't extract enough flavor standard drip grind . i'm mostly pleased this coffee maker after some experimentation adjustments water temperature , grind coffee , amount coffee .	-1
i wasn't sure what expect this pan , but it outshined everything i'd anticipated , based price . i got it less than ten bucks friday sale , i've already used it least ten times . it great frying ( i made fried chicken couple times , it came out perfectly , no hot spots . ) i've used it make spaghetti sauce , french toast , taco meat , chili mexican shredded chicken chicken nachos . it heavy enough feel sturdy your hand , they're snap clean , even mexican chicken ( you cook down couple hours . ) i haven't any problems sticking or scratching , it actually inspires me cook . you won't disappointed purchasing this pan ! it great cook uses lot different techniques or methods cooking ( soups , frying , steaming ) .	1

main thing this product it good value dollar . item inexpensive gets job large cooking area adequate features . there couple features could better , but course you going pay more get them . such less hot touch exterior , already mentioned , timer cannot turned stop , but temperature turned off , so not big issue	-1
we pleased purchase this heater . it works well smaller areas ( 10 15 ) but we also using it larger area ( 20 20 ) help small fan circulate heated air around room .	-1
this pillow looks simple enough , but there must lot research put into inventing it ! dogbone ( medium size , 16 " -- i don't remember specific dimensions ) instantly relieved many aches i my neck without forcing me lie down flat position ( which often gives me headache makes it impossible read while lying down ) . i'd doc quite few times back/neck problems i've lately , but no rx worked quite well this delightful cushion . my only issues it cleaning ( stuffing packed very tight , so i'd rather not try it out washer fear mold/mildew ; i spray it disinfectant every once while instead ) outer material ( optional moisture-wicking or allergen-reducing pillowcase would nice ) . however , i bought it based earlier reviews , i don't regret it	-1

i 2 honeywell 50100 air purifiers bought 2 these replacement hepa filter originals . hrf-11 new " permanent " replacement filter good choice . however , i rated this 4-star only despite fitting nicely 50100 . product statement " permanent " misleading , though you clean filter twice year vacum cleaner , manual still recommends you replace filter every 3 5 years under normal usage . i think kaz ( who licenses honeywell brand honeywell ) simply asking sued labeling product like this . i'll use words " extended life " if i them avoid law suits . other than , its great product cheaper than those throw-away type filters	-1

this review intended 4700 series pictured here see-through dustcontainer ! it joy use simplicity every way . engineers used sheer genius its plain simple design . my hard use might tend make automatic shut-off come into play , when years cat hair or whatever clogged filter first use , but i not expect happen again , i no cat . it previous owner years no vacuuming which caused it . if you motor turn off , wait half hour recommended , hey take break read good book amazon , then start her up again . but sure before you rest on/off pedal off position or motor might not realize it recovering not start up again . also unplug then certain plug it back ! notice no-clog hose . i finally give up my beloved eureka hepa filtered after yeaers very hard usage finally made right angle turn where hose hits floor forward brushes constantly blocked . i got tired dismantling tiny hard reach screws prying out collected dirt dust hair such . i must confess : i used abused my former eureka , including potting soil corner , paid price . now i discover very inexpensively elegant simplicity this wonderfully engineered marvel . notice again no-clog hose . rather than hidden right angle turn bottom , hose comes straight out , easily detached bottom clearing , which unnecessary any case . rather than multitude filters replaced great cost every few months , there one , which rinses off water . instead whole bunch attachments falling off main stand , there basics , no more , no less , including generously long wands attach generously long hose . most powerful engine available , full bore , blasting up floor , under this light weight yet poweful tool . check out interesting engineering floor clearance . rather than estimating carpet shag , or whether you pass mainly over bare floor low carpet , thus struggling turn hard reach clearance dial stiff fingers , you just hit engagement foot pedal clearance automatically adjusts present floor conditions , continues so fly you pass condition condition , rug linoleum . when machine ready rest , however unwillingly like young colt ready run some more but put away early stable , restoring it upright condition raises it clearance high enough roll into storage . handle easily effectively lowered reaching under tables even beds , powerful headlight really makes visuals ineluctably bright . engineers eureka really designed effective useful tool this one , elegant simplicity use maintenance . assembly also breeze joy one screwdriver . this one get . never mind those cheapo shop vacs lousy plastic attachments ; never mind those much more expensive rigs seductively bizarrely promising continuous suction . this one . take my advice , freely given . you may even thank me it . or let me come over dump dirt your carpet show you how great machine this . joy use . i can't wait carpet fill up dust again ! makes vacuuming contemplative prayer spiritual cleansing . further strong points this vac , those who not yet believe it , please notice handy handle near base which makes vacuuming up stairs easier , especially considering sturdy yet lightweight this vacuum . also notice ease removing emptying dirtbag ( i know it more canister but dirtbag great word ) rinsing out filter . i few moments puzzle putting dirtbag back but soon become second nature . i also must admit not used staircleaning feature i no stairs here desert .	1

i bought this pressure cooker set month ago i love it . i never used pressure cooker before i bought this set , but i find it easy use very safe . set comes nice instruction book ( cooking times lots different food ) small book recipes . i like i cook brown rice less time than it takes me make white rice without pressure cooker ( 20 minutes ) . i successfully adapted recipe slow-roasted pulled pork prepare it sauce scratch less than hour . long you're not looking crusty exterior , i think you make food comperable quality oven or slow-cooker much shorter amount time . i find two pots very convenient making different quantities food . glass lid , they work very well other tasks such steaming veggies briefly . my only complaint set insides pots hard get clean . here directions cleaning fagor website : " sometimes stains may build up inside your pressure cooker normal everyday use . good way remove stains add equal parts lemon juice water your cooker heat this liquid until hot . you then use nonabrasive sponge remove stains . not clean cooker any abrasive materials this may damage finish your pressure cooker .	1
