epson r2400 purely photo printer . sure understand this before you buy . so if you planning one printer think this it . . . think again . k3 inks not compatible plain paper any documents you print plain paper horribly color shifted distorted . it took three calls epson replacing icc profile before they would finally admit problem k3 ink compatibility plain paper . all magazines raved black white printing quality . not . least not premium quality photo paper . perhaps some more expensive matt papers . i saw very little improvement over my epson r320 . now if you going use it strictly photo printer then this very nice printer . biggest drawback you not find ink cartridges any major store such staples . stock ink guarantee there not apply items not carried strore . this hint #1 . hint #2 if you run out ink weekend need something monday you sol . only option you order ink online . trust amazon they find deliver . however if some reason your lucky enough large pro photo store near bye they may cartridges . cartridges certainly dont last very long $12-$15 each eight them your burning $100-$125 set . bulk ink tanks coming out but i doubt k3 inks imitated . if you stand ordering everything online only looking great photo printer than this may just ticket you . however $850 i fully expected able print documents pictures plain paper . i haven't happy this printer i plan replace it soon . amazon able locate ship ink only reason its still here .	1

i really tried like via michelin , bought it every intention loving it march 2007 . but i feel compelled tell most you " keep shopping . " i bought it due excellent price , small thin size(compared garmin ) . i thought " how bad it ? " i ordered it it shipped my door , then took off 3400 mile trip it . this because my other gps units other cars , other family members already other trips . i bought this one budget gps , optimistic it new sirf-iii chip . but before long , i hated this unit , all criticms other reviews came back haunt me , i tell you it below . first , please note there few positive reviews this unit .... but you noticed they mostly all people who no experience " other " gps units ? or they didn't spend much time it before they reviewed it ? or they haven't experience gps 4 years .. which like century terms how fast this technology changing ? positive reviewers , if this their first " newer " gps if they comparing it car navigational gps 4 years ago , then yes , it quite bit better . but compared new units like mio 310x or tom tom one ( both which i own ) then viamichelin " horrible " user interface , horrible use roads . tomtom mio , often finish what you typing you , they intuitive programmers polished them . but viamichelin very non intuitive , absolutely dangerous try use fly . sure , we not supposed use them while we drive , this one it truly dangerous even when you learn complicated system . so most time , you pull over work it . but it no fun , even you program it , if you go screen it " loses " it you program history all over . you soon frustrated how many steps this unit takes anything , how " lost " it often gets . i try give you pros : pros : small form factor , decent screen , sirf 3 chip . navteq maps . four hour battery life . good price sirf-3 chip unit . cons : horrible non intuitive software program , clunky , multi step interface make your life horrible if you rush or emergency ... or even if you not hurry . horrible speaker .. volume so poor speaker so poor , you can't hear it any road noise present ... seriously ... turn speaker up all way while driving .. it crackle illegible . i read this review , but honestly didn't believe it until i owned it . third , unlike any gps i've , this one literally tells you " start driving " before it tell you which way go , when you've routed it nearest store , etc . think ! it means sometimes you 50% chance making right choice which way go ... then if you guess wrong , it tells you turn around go other way ! seriously ... one feature should enough make you say " no " most gps least tell you " turn right " where you parked or " turn left " but this one say " start driving " without any direction .... because it can't seem route until you drive onto road . it can't it parking lot ! it already satellite location ... that not it .. it software bugaboo i think built into programming . it makes you " start driving " because it can't find your location or know which way you going .. until you start it routes direction you traveling . bad software design sure . when you go canada , you installed ( sd card ) canadian map .... very inconvenient when you cross border . navteq maps could not find many locations coastal maine . literally , we driving coastal roads it said not exist . i found it very slow recalculating trips when you missed turn ( much slower than my mio 310 which purchasd last year , or tom tom one which purchased this year ) this recalculation problem busy city traffic , caused us miss several critical exits . want find poi run ? forget it . too many steps illogical organization compared other major brands . it often could not find even local walmarts ... one there 20 years . i'm serious . i parked front walmarts it could not find ... very old walmarts . sure , garmin , tomtom mio not list all walmarts , but least they get 4 or 5 out 7 my home town . not so via . several towns maine connecticut , i parked front rows old stores there years . punch local stores difficult use poi list , it can't find any them . also , punch or look stores like nearest walmart .... mio tom tom no problems finding several .. or nearest ones it knew your location . but via , it within certain distance you .. or it not show up existing . so .... you then figure out next town search location , try find store . very , very clunky .... can't tell you how much trouble . it so simple other units , you get spoiled garmin or tomtoms . this one makes it so hard still can't find poi . no gps finds all stores .... there limit poi , course . but it seems via programmers spent their time gathering addresses bank atm not restaurants , shopping , etc . believe me , once you've used it trip , it organized make you believe programmers never actually used gps themselves before . i can't say enough how " difficult " interface .... when you go " back " or " forward " screen , it often loses where it ... you start all over again programming where you going , going through multiple difficult steps . when you lose power , again , you start all over . when i bought it , i read some negative positive reviews thought .... how bad it ? i thought complaining people probably not techie complaining no reason . wrong ! experienced gps users ones know just how clunky bad this software interface compared sleek garmin or tom tom interfaces . example : one trip , my daughter began throw up , we find emergency medical treatment facility .... this clunky interface made it very difficult locate one . when you panicked , you want quickly find nearest hospital . this unit makes you put town , etc . if you further than miles or so ... like when you interstate .... so you literally guessing which town search find hospital . which horrible . i this happen before mio , 3 clicks bam you searched found nearest hospital ... one more click you routed nearest hospital . truly , i am sad not recommend viamichelin . i really recommend you " pass " like some other reviewers suggested . i recommend you buy more rapid , easy use mio great screen , blazing fast sirf 3 calculating chip , loud-clear-speaker . if you tech challenged , buy garmin or tomtom their awesome easy use software interface . but don't buy this bad speakered , horrible interfaced , poorly designed , buggy unit . paper , it looks like killer unit . but reality , it unpolished clunky paper tiger horrible use . finally , there " fun " factor . tomtom one fun . mio fast fun , pleasure use ! even newer garmin fun their simplicity ( i hated screen some old garmins . ) but viamichelin x-930 no fun programmed .... it not pleasure use , although it take you across country . believe me , pleasure low price quickly fade once you start working unhearable speaker , unpolished , unfun , clunky , interface poorly organized features disorganized poi menus . polished quick intuitive menu where garmin tomtom shine . only thing better viamichellin screen sirf-chip ... some older garmin use older satellite gps chip than viamichellin , but new tomtom via use same gps satellite chip , but faster software routines cpu chips . but even use sirf-3 chip via michelin , cannot make up poor software menu design . theoretically , this thing should blazing fast , but it much slower than my tomtom or mio . only thing better this unit than mio , via smaller thinner . maybe navteq maps might slightly better some locals . but other than , mio wins hands down , far faster , better easier use gps my opinion . if you looking software ease , go garmin first , then tom-tom , then mio , via last . if you looking value great unit then go mio 310x , it killer unit it hackable . but if you looking simplicity i programming where you going , go garmin first , then tom-tom . i tried you mr. viamichelin , but you need go " finishing school " like other gps students . you just too unfinished rough	1

my opinion : i own ton panasonic equipment , most recently dvd recorder . i using sony dvd-rs no problems , but , panasonic person , i figured panasonic must better . order save few bucks , i joined panasonic club panasonic website , ordered spindle these same type dvd-rs . i this 9/20/06 . i made several phone calls emails find out where my discs , , believe it or not , nobody panasonic could tell me why they hadn't shipped . then , i promised they ship , but i never got them . after talked into placing duplicate order panasonic rep , i didn't get order either . i finally received one order 10/16/06 . they so poorly packaged holder broken . now , i finally my discs . guess what ? they only 1-8x speed ( sony discs 1-16x speed ) , my thermal label printer wouldn't print them because finish . i assured i could print them thermal printer . i burn couple movies , they worked , but i saw nothing special i report . it gets worse : i logged into my panasonic club account , saw two charges i hadn't made : one $ 10,017 one $915 . i fell off back my chair . this day nobody called me , but i managed get some email responses , i told i would watch my credit card - that just what i need ! you know , sometimes you buy brand think great things how wonderful company it , then one day you some dealings realize how wrong you . i'm going back sony , let me tell you , amazon customer service blows away just every company i've dealt ( sorry preposition ) . i should bought amazon .	1

amazon great shipping this product , but i eventually returned it due several problems . they also great return -- they paid return shipping i got full refund . i never tried any recordings this card using media center software part windows mce . i using it snapstream beyondtv 4.1 . if you record using anything but best ( dvd 720x480 ) quality level it would crop out part picture . this known issue apparently driver issue . latest hauppauge driver not solve problem . other problem i several times when i recording two programs same time , one recordings nothing but static audio portion it . i don't know if this problem card or beyondtv , but i think it probably due card . i don't know if i defective card or if this just problem all these cards . i also not impressed overall quality video this card captured . i hauppauge 250 350 cards couple other pcs , video quality they capture noticeably better than captured 500 card . after reading some reviews , it sounds like this case 150 card also ( 500 card basically just two 150s placed one card ) . beyondtv works great 250 350 cards none issues noted above ; but i also only one tuner card pcs i use these cards , so i can't comment how well they would work dual tuner setup using beyondtv . i returned 500 card , i instead purchased two visiontek xtasy theater 550 pro cards . thus far i'm not any issues them beyondtv i hauppauge 500 card -- i record lower quality level no cropping , i've no audio issues so far . quality video also far superior captured 500 card ( although maybe not good captured hauppauge 250 350 cards ) .	1

not buy this system . money there much better systems out there . i bought this my family room mainy small size cube speakers . main problem system ( which bose corrected way ) " acoustimass " component ( bose fancy name subwoofer ) not active ( or powered ) which means base totally inadequate overun cubes which no mid or bass ranges . result you get very " tinny " sound out most applications including dvd . i ended up getting sony active subwoofer it sounds much better . hindsight i would bought different brand than bose , but already much invested bose scrap system completely , size cubes nice . still pissed i spent much money substandard system , but hey , got sucked into bose marketing machine	-1
claiming this fan " 3-speed switch lets you balance quiet performance maximum cooling " , very misleading . low , fan barely moves any air . high , it still doesn't move much air , incredibly quiet , nearing silent my opinion . if you looking high performance fan turned down while not under heavy loads , this not fan you . 3-speed switch useless , there no reason run it anything other than high	1
i purchased md781 + md71 expansion phone after briefly its predecessor md681 . i really like md681 but i could never locate one its expansion handsets ( everyone online/offline constantly out stock ) . overall i'm disappointed this new model after two weeks use i am already looking phone . handheld phones : i like them more than any other phone i've tried . unlike most phones these days they're big very solid feel them ... it just easier hold onto phone like this longer conversation . buttons nice size easy use . hands free/speak phone handheld works well . one person handheld line sound pretty good , but two people handsets you get significant background noise so bad it hurts your ear it hard hear person other end conversation . shared phonebook terrific idea but it could better . it few clicks slow access ... almost quick old rolodex hand ... or copy number local units phonebook ... which defeats purpose . answer machine : once you play messages you no longer visible indicator how many messages , if any , system ( it just me or poor design ) , so if you listen messages when you partner isn't around you need leave note them check messages . quality voice messages bit grainy . i also like how handset docked older m681 ; it laid base so you option wall mounting base ... md781 sits up base like some sort obelisk .	1

i bought this backup drive several months ago my home business after iomega backup drive i using crashed took my backup it . maxtor software installs automatically when you plug drive so part really easy it took just few minutes . initial backup really easy went pretty fast too . so far , so good . problem once initial backup takes place backup function doesn't backup new or updated files ! scheduled backup doesn't work all . light flashes so you think it working but it doesn't backup any new or updated files . synch useless too . it like backup function . it synch your files one time but then after it doesn't synch any your new or updated files like it supposed . it like it takes snapshot your computer specific time that it . get around fact it won't automatically back up my files i manually transfer my files every few days or so which real pain i remember what files updated and/or new . i would not buy this product again . it not automatic backup drive , it just external drive back up one time but then isn't reliable all . if you need backup drive look elsewhere . sorry say , this one complete waste money .	-1

this perfect little tv/dvd little girl room ! picture great hello kitty pops screen certain commands ( volume , channel change .. ) . my daughter age 4 loves it . i would given this product 5 stars but there couple drawbacks ... remote control so many buttons they very tiny , very close together . i barely read what each button because labels/print also very tiny . this annoying when my daughter darkened room i turn bright light just find pause button ... other thing i point out bugs me you can't eject/or open dvd player unless tv dvd mode . other words when i go put dvd , i can't just push " open " . nothing happen . you find right button , choose " dvd " choice 3-4 things , only then tray slide open . all all , these things would not prevent me buying this tv again ... although it would nice if they come out w/ more kid friendly remote bigger buttons/symbols small child recognize ... one great thing i want point ou t--t here fast forward scan you watch it fast forwards ( something not all dvd players offer ) this great when you putting dvd your child they want skip all those pre-movie ads .... you ff right beginning movie !!!	1

this particular cam some issues but long you understand how configure it , it blow you away . i've heard people complain dlink they get ball tech support , autually their tech support sucks but i don't need them . this not plug play device so study online manual carefully . when you actually learn how use it , you won't buy anything else price . if you tech savey , you really enjoy product . i nine cams installed three locations . using their ip software you view upto 16 once . reason i'm back , this site , because i need order two more . i return my first one but it pre-production unit somebody forgot timing gear . dlink sent my replacement direct . oldest cam worked flawlessly year now . one last comment , next closent cam panasonic but equal quality you pay 50% more less features	1

i dvd scratched during shipping . one repair kit nothing help it . i considered using skip dr. , but i never cared what it disks . my church media center uses optifix system , so i decided try it , too . scratch gone , dvd plays no problem whatsoever . i'll admit not all scratches repaired this way ; some scratches cannot repaired all . i just know it worked great me	1
i impressed this controller first , found it feel comfortable , work well . it played once while month ( total 10 hours max ) . some time after , next time i went use it , it would only go left game used left joystick . i could not get it center ( or even stay still ) , it would just keep either steering car ( like burnout3 ) or whatever left joystick would game no matter what . i tried it several times , it never worked since . i fire it up once while see if it still doing it , it . i am very dissapointed this , i pretty careful getting this newer version logitech controller . i think i paid $45 locally it , i just bought pelican extreme edge radio shack clearance $19.99 works feels good , but less than half cost . i don't really feel like going thru warranty claim , if it even covered , but it still annoys me every time i look it my xbox ' drawer ' extra stuff . i going go totally wireless ( 4 units ) luckily didn't run out buy 3 more these logitech controllers . i instead bought some extra microsoft controllers , they still one best feeling controllers out there . if pelican holds up , ( model pl-2050 version 2.0 ) i might go get some more if i find them locally .	-1

brilliant images . highest quality . you simply cannot beat this system price . also , this particular projection tv handles non-hdtv channels very well - not all hdtv models this . fact most channels not available hdtv yet , so it nice high quality tv deliver non-hdtv channels you high quality rendering . this tv very well . yes it nothing like hdtv , but all same they fine job this model	1
this system quite sleek , easy fit cluttered living room . assembly takes two minutes . instructions very clear . sound amazing , especially when you put your favorite loud , bass-heavy film . why then i give it one star ? it skips . like nobody business . first , my wife i thought it disks we putting many them scratched . but then we put new disks . no difference . when exactly it skip ? impossible tell . sometimes little . sometimes every frame ! sometimes it'll tell us disks bad . then next time we put them they magically work -- until they skip . so i called philips they said not only would we pay shipping , but they could not guarantee they would fix it , it would take up month before they'd ship it back . save your money ! buy someone else	-1

i used half these batterys . mostly clocks different items around house , but also i used them flash my camera they held up real good . i lot rechargeable batterys , but these better because they last lot longer . often rechargeable batterys only last few months if long . alkaline batteries me last up year longer . if amazon went back free shipping these then i would buy them up give them friends gift or prize . i not know what shipping , but it may still worthwhile . i just know so far these batteries held up real good i would highly recommend them .	1

i've got lite-on dvdrw sohw-1673s burner ( revision js02 ) my fast g4 mac running os tiger burning toast titanium 7 . although my burner nominally 16x-capable , it only burns 6x my setup , probably due slow ( ata 33 ) bus it . i've used number different brands 8x 16x disks , both +r -r , verification failure rate less than 2% -- so few , fact , i often don't bother verifying video dvd anymore when burning tdk or maxell discs . ( i always verify data dvd , since errors those not ignorable . ) but memorex , i've gotten 20% failures , including couple aborted burns ! one case , disc blank band two burned ones ! memorex discs i'm referring manufacturer id " cmc mag , am3 " . according videohelp.com, these sold under least 7 different brand names . reviews there rather mixed , which not imho good enough ! i not , btw , any problems memorex dvd+r discs i've tried . but i stopped using them because one my players won't recognize +r format	1

first all , let my point out mine came demos crimson skies mech assault full version xbox classic arcade . mine new certified microsoft box , etc . maybe they just updated games . anyways , it my opinion better deal buy 12-month pack , but i decided 3-month just because i've got 2-month trial already didn't want 14 months built up . box : there communicator headset , 3-month subscription card , game discs , several manuals connecting xbox live . communicator : purely awesome . i read many people comments saying it breaks little clip . i grant it clip thin could potentially break easily , but it not uber fragile . don't afraid put it . headset weighs next nothing really comfortable . it great outgoing voice quality great sound quality through speaker . xbox live itself : you broadband ? you router switch or hub if needed ? if answers both yes , you need xbox live . it incredible . buy this or 12-month kit if you just starting ( but don't forget start your account first free 2 months . after you live already , renew subscription card	1
i bought blue logger both street atlas 2005 sa2005 hh my dell x50v . no problem blue logger gps but my complaints follows : 1 . delorme not include blue logger manager software hh . now they want sell it separately additional $39 . very weird marketing strategy indeed . 2 . software pocket pc very difficult use , not very intuitive . it seems hand held software developed afterthought software pc . it poorly designed , appeared not fully tested normal users prior releasing market . 3 . it very cumbersome slow determine route . even 620 mhz axim , it slow . worse yet , route often wrong . example , this afternoon i use sa2005 determine route friend house . i followed route , i would come dead end street back track 10 miles get correct route my destination . luckily , i decided use my paper map . later , i tried microsoft mapping internet it actually gave me correct routing . last week location , sa2005 found wrong location given address which would take me 4 miles off . luckily , i knew where it ignored routing sa2005 hh . 4 . many other mapping softwares hh allow one use it 1 hand often finger . but not sa2005 hh . after 2 weeks using it , i found myself going back my old paper map . example , if i not calculated route just simply use gps map travel , software only show street i but no name given no street name shown upcoming cross streets . it not help when you lost . 5 . sa2005 maps seems several years old not very up date . i guess that why delorme not want clearly advertise this issue . i am seriously considering giving up sa2005 consider this my $50 learning mistake , looking microsoft street trip 2005 or later 1q 2005 , iguidance who supposed latest map . i am not alone this several other users also complained delorme user forum . i wish i read forum before buying delorme software . well , live learn .	1

i read all 181 reviews decided half reviewers not get model i . or else they wrote their review too soon . i bought mine june 2006 . it failed before store warranty ran out . one down . replacement lasted month or two before it hung wouldn't boot . two down . sandisk honored their 1 year warranty prompt free rma . one also failed . three down . they replaced it both m230 2gb c150 . c150 hung after 2 weeks . four down . i using m230 two weeks now hope it lasts until c150 replacement arrives . i gotten quite good rma game intend keep playing it either until my warranty runs out or i get one those other people rave . i don't think i'll buy sandisk - unless it free lifetime warranty . i suggest everyone failed m230 exercise thier warranty rights . sandisk needs know true reliability their products .	-1
i purchased one these when new back 2004 . unit worked ok me , main quirk once every hour or two , i go through 3 - 5 minute period bad reception , presumably it shifts one satelite . i unable utilize fm modulator it weak , but went hard wired connection my radio using cable purchased crutchfield . my main issue this unit there newer units available same or slightly more money , which replay options better displays . i would consider those options before purchasing this unit	1
i bought this same brand discs sometime last year this very site . i very pleased purchase then . i didn't one problem discs . i bought pack recently i've using pack i just bought . all discs messing up me . i understand few problematic discs but this insane whole pack discs every single one them messes up you . i wish i could send these discs back get refund . this purchase scared me away anything else related memorex . i thought memorex very reliable brand they would make sure they sending out top notch items consumers . i guess i wrong . apparently you get what you pay . don't fooled good price . you'll just out your money stuck discs wouldn't even worth using frisbee . find brand use avoid this brand	-1

ok - here what you get : 1 power supply brick1 ipod dock1 3-foot cable connect power supply brick dock1 3-foot cable connect dock stereothis version kit compatible 3rd 4th generation ipods ( those dock connector bottom ) ipod mini . although dock connector electronically same all these ipods , dimensions ipod itself differ model . thus , dock comes different plastic tops different sizes ipods you snap right-sized top your ipod ( check size carefully before snapping cover - it goes easily , but it doesn't come off easily ) . cable connects power supply brick dock special apple firewire-to-ipod-dock cable , but cable connects ipod stereo system nothing special , just standard stereo minijack plug one end two rca phono plugs other . you get compatible cable many different vendors many different lengths ; which my case good thing because 3-foot length kit too short . kit good buy ? well , it depends . if you price all components kit separately , you find kit cheaper than individual parts , even if you replace stereo cable i . but , question , you need buy all parts . let assume moment you fact want attach your ipod your stereo consider what you might able without :( 1 ) power supply brick . your ipod dock fact work fine without plugged into power supply . trade-off without it you drain battery ipod while it plugged into your stereo . you get dock stereo cable substantially less than this kit , so if you're ok battery issue , you save money not getting kit . ( 2 ) ipod dock . you plug ipod into stereo without dock . same stereo cable connects dock stero also connect ipod stereo . there two disadvantages this : first , dock gives true line-out , meaning volume control ipod doesn't affect volume coming out dock , so you just use stereo volume control control playback volume . audi o-o ut jack ipod , however , affected ipod volume control , so if you connect it stereo , you careful fact there two volume controls system , which annoying best , there might some risk your stereo if ipod volume too high . it also worth noting if you power supply brick , you not need dock recharge your ipod - brick plug into ipod directly . if you ok audi o-o ut thing ( whether how keep your ipod upright without it ) you save money not getting kit doing without dock . ( 3 ) power-supply brick dock cable . if you don't brick , you don't need cable ; if you brick , you need cable or brick isn't going you any good . if you decided you without recharging ipod while it connected your stereo , you skip brick this cable both . ( 4 ) dock-to-stereo cable . this thing you can't without if you want connect your ipod your stereo , but you lot choices vendors if this all you're getting . even if you aren't getting dock , cable would connect dock stereo same one would connect ipod stereo directly . one more thing consider your ipod might already come one or more these pieces , if you aren't using them elsewhere , you could use them part your stereo set-up just buy any other pieces you need not get whole kit . me , i didn't any extra pieces i wanted works - recharge ipod not worry double volume control , so i got kit . i also got navipod ir remote ( which you get right here amazon ) so i could control it remotely like rest my stereo gear . make your decision , just figure out what you want , what pieces you already , what you might willing live without then make your decision . hope this helpful	1
i record dvd movies hobby am always looking better media , software etc . - i'd using ridata some time w/ next no coasters but figured i'd upgrade go memorex this time around . big mistake . they skip , pixelate freeze up . i recopy least 5 out last dozen or so movies i've . it compatibility issue i could understand , but it appears strictly problem quality media . i'm going back using my cheap disks ! lesson here : " if it works , dont fix it !	-1

this card 2 gb ultimate 120x it tested write speed 120 times 150kb/sec which exceeds 18 mb per second . frequently card manufacturers advertise their read speed , which always much faster . analyze your file size pictures you take speed mb/sec tell you how many those pictures you store one second . impacts time pictures . cameras , write speed most important , but speed rating card doesn't necessarily tell you its write speed . music players other devices , read speed may more important . so you might choose different card depending whether you intend use it play music or take pictures . i'm currently shopping sd cards camera capability shoot 3 pictures per second large file sizes . order not slow camera down , i need fast card . i some research realized reviews here aren't necessarily even related this particular card , but all different sizes speeds kingston cards . kingston memory business long time they conservative their ratings . this card #1 my list right now because its tested write speed	1
i bought this memory card my camera sd500 . first , i very dispointed when i only see 1gb my laptop . after googled around , i realized i need update my laptop sd reader driver recognized sd card over 1gb . i'm able see full 2gb after driver update . just make sure you update your device/laptop firmware/driver first	1
i use this conjunction sandisk ultra ii 2.0 gb compact flash card . i like it , but flash card doesn't slide easily . sometimes it get stuck halfway , if unit not designed properly sliders card offer enough give slide card left or right pins . add insult injury , both reader flash card manufactured sandisk . therefore , they should work seamlessly together , but pathetically , they don't . i'd much rather pay more reader worked great , rather than save few dollars reader makes you work every time you use thing . comparison , my camera accepts card perfectly . there no give all , but instead effortless process . not quality reader . other than , it works expected . surprisingly , reader doesn't topple over easily i thought it would . it stands vertically looks like it might fall over when trying slide card . sliding card 2 handed process , so one hand holds unit while other slides it . removing card extremely easy . that one-handed process . " eject " card pc drive then remove it . data transfer card pc very quick . overall , i'm glad it , but it annoyance use it . i hate card getting stuck halfway reader	1
card works great my camera . what more there say	1
i little tentative order itrip lcd because some bad reviews i read . it seems like there very few people sitting fence this item . buyers either love it or hate it . i leaving trip hoped itrip would arrive so i could use it my drive . luck would it , it my mailbox day before i left . i unwrapped it went out vehicle test it . i plugged it into my 20gb ipod photo right off bat thought i trouble . it wouldn't power up , i tried plugging unplugging , cleaning contacts finally last resort , read instructions . after plugging it you play song before it power . this immediately explains why so many poeple complain doas right out box . i set frequency lowest available fm band presto !!! instant music . i don't live extremely populated area so i can't really comment other stations bleeding through but loud passages loud quiet passages quiet . many reviewers complained bad sound quality but you must remember this . it doesn't matter how great quality song your ipod , you playing it over fm radio so it never sound better than fm radio . i inherited my father ' 91 accord work car when he retired it bare bones am/fm radio tone control(bass treble all rolled into one handy knob !!! ) cheap 6 1/2 inch speakers front doors . when i drive i like listen talk radio podcasts occasionally music . sound quality exactly what i expected , no better no worse . i also tested it my wife ' 01 focus . it nice factory 6 speaker cd system sound ipod just fine . bass still thumped highs seemed just tiny bit off but still not bad all . i am completely satisfied product . one strange thing i noticed may explain why some people complain bad sound quality if you tap itrip , sound comes through your speakers much like tapping microphone . if you lay it hard surface your vehicle you could probably hear it through your speakers when encountering rough road . unless there defective batch sent out , i don't know where all complaints come . i got mine $15 private seller amazon consider it great purchase especially amount money . don't hesitate buy one , it works advertised sound quality what it . if you keep these things mind , you won't disappointed	1

best ever , i tell ... my choice 9x12 format decision taken based my traditional arts background , since i make oil paintings traditional lineart drawing concept arts , i use very much wide strokes combination " wrist arm wide motion " . so this tablet well suited this task not too much exagerated size not too small wide movements . 6x8 wacom tablet would more restricted me , but those who like small area usage drawing painting this 9x12 digital adjust so you work it 6x8 , but remember space your desk , it not ' mouse pad ' definitively , get 19 " monitor screen - flat it down table , that almost same space you gonna need . way ... those thinking something different wacom tablets ... don't think ! wacom only one you trust 100% , no doubts , i've tried many ... if you don't know wich wacom suits best you , i suggest you go www.wacom.com , they questionaire there help you out , but it simple : if you pro ... get this intuos3 or better intuos available , that hardcore professional choice , if don't need much pressure sensitivity , make ' lighter ' work , go graphire , if you pro want something work milimetrical accuracy like architecture or technical design get cintiq ( this one top expesive one ) . other application work perfect it too , like 3d software , i use xsi , max , maya , zbrush(this one only wacom please ! ) , modo many other applications composing editing like combustion premiere , it changes way you work better productivity , believe-me . pen tilt great " painter " software , what you maybe would take day finish you seconds literally , wrist sweep tilting pen you create amazing effects one second . also reduce stress your hand arm caused mouse , it improve your life quality not harming you like mouse when you get many our computer . besides it programmable buttons it smart scroll , so you may use you mouse only games after . important point - usb cable huge enough so you work confortably away your monitor screen tablet your lap if wish so . finish : i love my 9x12 wacom , if you buy it you love it too , give it accessories so this babe get happier * lol*a travel bag , replacement tips ( nibs ) kit , sure if you or need ... buy other pen like 6d art pen airbrush so you make extraordinary artworks . hope this helps your choice . best regards ! eduardo . janiszewskicg artist animato	1

most anyone tell you , these speakers excellent sound if you're just going set them up your desktop , then i'd give them 5 stars . however , design wall mounting these horrible you can't ceiling-mount them . logitech not make separate mounts these no " universal speaker mounts " work them . if you want see how they mount , go logitech website , go product support enter wall mounting . some might argue they're computer speakers , not home entertainment center speakers , but $300 , i expect little bit better design	1

this little reader fast easy use usb flash drive . pop your card , plug it , wahlah , all your files shown . transfers very fast easy . it uses standard usb cable , so it likely you could use same cable variety devices ( mp3 player , camera , cell phone)the device somewhat flimsy , however front always snaps off when you try open unit rather than working like hinge , it should . this somewhat annoying reattach hinge everytime , so it gets 4 stars . still very good buy , especially price	1

this product stinks . typically , documentation not written standard english , but some cyber-patois no civilized person understands . their support material exhaustive exhausting solves no user problem . i bought it primarily book reading , so far , not able access single one . quot ; desktop managerquot ; tells me quot ; synchronizationquot ; went ok , but proves false . stories i downloaded nowhere found . i look under franklin reader find nothing . i look under mobi reader find same . i don't need calculator , or memo book , or solitaire game , or voice recorder , or mp3 player , or phone book . i wanted portable library fiction , nonfiction , whatever , this gadget not give it me . if you remember seinfeld episode which foreign professor threw electronic organizer out window , you idea what i feel like doing this thing . i bought it clearance company ebay 50 bucks , so it not huge loss . but i want ebook reader . apparently , there lot ebooks online taking ( or buying ) , but i'll never see them , not franklin ebookman anyway . i'm certainly not going search device . once burned , twice shy	-1

all right , i've wanting share my experience while , so here my story : i interested buying 50-55 inch flat panel tv my living room - nothing smaller . viewing distance tv 10-13 feet . it either going lcd or plasma . i researched market several months , reading reviews , comparing tvs store , etc . i finally took plunge decided this panasonic beauty . i love it don't regret it one bit . if picture quality your top priority , then this tv meet your expectations if not exceed them . colors very natural - it not too bright artificial-looking like some other tvs i saw . i think this advantage plasma over lcds general , i noticed lcd artificial colors effect during my comparisons store . contrast excellent . this actually charasteristic i didn't consider too much , but realized during comparisons how important it . some other plasma lcd tvs poor blacks you could obviously see when you compared panasonic them . i tried tweaking settings other tvs it didn't get any better . you actually see details dark areas panasonic which very important movie watching . watching non-hd programs also quite good . i say quite good because none tvs out there display non-hd content 100% perfectly . but panasonic it better than most . hd programs - incredible ! you actually feel you there . dvds crystal clear well . sports fantastic - no blurring . tv extremely wide viewing angles . trust me , you so much fun watching tv this ! tv speakers more than adequate . i bought surround sound system , but i only turn those when i watch movie or big sporting event . regular watching shows , news , sports , speakers great . finally , i'd like address issue " burn-in . " lot people get scared buying plasma because they're afraid ghost images appearing after static images display screen while . well , i've using this tv four months now - it everyday . i watch shows , sports , movies ( black bars ) , even play video games it . i don't any trace burn-in . course , sensible , don't pause image 24 hours . i read panasonic handles image-burn very well , so this reason buy this tv - especially if you're considering plasma .	1

i purchased hp 8450 year half ago . i see complaints other reviews speed cost ink , but if you send photos off photo lab , not only would it take more time money but quality would not any better . i find print quality good professional lab i used , if not better . i print around 30 50 photos month , mainly sell customers this lot more economical than lab . if you looking wal-mart quality go wal-mart . but if you looking professional quality i not say enough hp 8450 .	1

this set impressive . my husband i somewhat limited size/brands lcd units would fit our family room entertainment center . we like our tv hidden when not use our entertainment center won't accept tv wider than 39 " . last year , perhaps 18 months ago ? we purchased 32 " lcd fit , but we couldn't use our tivo it some reason . we also thought picture looked too small compared our tube flat screen sony . we quickly returned i t.t his month costco coupon book offers this set $300 off savings , so it $999 out door us here oregon . sharp apparently changed exterior dimensions aquos line since we last shopped low behold , we able purchase 37 " instead 32 " . we've ditched our tivo our local cable company dvr w/hd we happy campers . very easy set up two hdmi outlets , one our dvr/cable box one our dvd player . like computer lcd monitors , you tweak your monitor settings , so take time this you won't disappointed . true diehards paying professional calibration but we're happy both digital hd picture quality simple tweaks . sound impressive well . i truly feel like we've got surround sound , without actually home theater set-up . we're very satisfied picture quality , sound quality sharp interface . fact , we returned our local costco warehouse picked up set bedroom .	1

this mouse incredibly difficult use . there actually only one button : whole carapace mouse . so your hand can't really relaxed when you're using it , you continually concentrate order get true right-clicks . order get true right-click , you want grip mouse -- but only place it affords gripping without tending cause false-clicks two little pads right left side . alas , if you grip those ( default mode ) , you get expose , which interrupts your attempt right-click ; if you reflexively follow through click , most time you'll get switched application ( because hey , you just clicked app window expose screen ) . scroll ball nice idea , but it half size it needs order afford decent amount control . without , you get all kinds false directionals ( scrolling right/left when you're trying scroll up/down ) using scroll-ball center-click tricky : often not , even after you configure scroll-ball click " button 3 " , you often not get funky " mouse scrolling " action ( icon appears screen you scroll currently focused document moving mouse pointer -- not crazy idea , but totally counter-productive when what i wanted open clicked link new tab ) . basically , this fussy , fussy device difficult most people use . but since looks so beautiful , they'll blame problems themselves give it high rating anyway .	-1

part my review based fact parts missing when i opened box , manual ( antenna , video cable who knows what else ) , but i able download pdf version manual survived install process . surround sound good compared panasonic sc-ht940 . but when i saw heard onkyo 5.1 hdmi htib w/ single disc dvd hts894 few days after getting samsung , onkyo won hands down . samsung suffers poor manual if these things ( htibs ) intuitive not many connections . i am technical person nothing manual intuitive other than page numbers . i liked tower speakers , but aesthetics aside , sound more important than looks . speaker wire very cheap , but sound still good despite . lack connections hurts samsung well hdmi pass-through . bass good surround sound excellent . but reviewer mentioned out box config bad . cnet tips helped setup . i loved fact it comes changer opposed single disc player . question if you're going spend thousands dollars hdtv , why skimp sound system . overall samsung sound system very good , but i chose upgrade . sound like beauty ear beholder , my ears onkyo system delivers higher highs deeper lows yes it cost more .	1

i case logic cd wallets 7+ years ago still good shape ... despite abuse i put them through . i bought this one only because cd collection expansion . i find simply wiping off outside cover wet sponge keeps it clean . nylon covers really hold up over time . remember- " 128 cd capacity " refers cds without their accompaning booklets . it really 64 cds booklets .	1

i ordered one these because my receiver only 1 optical input i needed second input my x-box 360 . i also ordered 2 relatively cheap optical cables parts express seller well . this splitter no optical connector end so short optical cable + longer one run one inputs 360 also necessary . other input used oppo 970hd dvd player i already cable use one . it pretty straight forward how use splitter . time spent hooking this up maybe 10 minutes max would've probably even less i quick access back my receiver . originally i no idea something like this existed i stumbled upon this product accident . price more than reasonable save you buying new receiver if you need second optical input . i've mine week not noticed distortion or changes sound quality . highly recommended	1
little dipole antenna comes most stereo tuners barely adequate fm reception . big outdoor fm antenna pain put up aim best reception . terk tried step into breach fm 50 amplified antenna . this amplifed folded dipole fully enclosed weather-resistant . it also mounted indoors , but length nearly 5 feet , it doesn't exactly blend drapes . but you're interested performance , or you wouldn't considering spending nearly 70 bucks this thing , would you ? well , amplifier low-noise type , filters out-of-band interference . gain somewhat variable . said , let talk briefly afc most radios . most tuners built lock onto strongest signal , if two adjacent frequencies . likewise , if filters used most stereos nowdays bit wider than absolutely necessary , order provide higher fidelity . if you trying pull weaker station adjacent stronger one , afc fight your efforts . amplifying signals only makes things worse . amplifiers more beneficial picking up weak stations not stations adjacen t.t he amplifier terk fm 50 turned off . folded dipole element itself , my opinion , excellent fm antenna . it pull weak stations right out noise . amplifier less effective , my opinion . if terk offered just antenna , sans amplifier , good price , i'd give it 5 stars . it good . but 70 bucks whole shebang bit steep , i think , what you get . if you're near city , you probably going leave amplifier turned off most time . you only get full benefit your 70 bucks if you live fringe reception area . one final minor gripe : your purchase doesn't even include coaxial lead-in cable . you'll go your neighborhood electronics store buy . quality , 5 stars . overall value , 3 stars	1

i using this over month now . got it lt ; $300 , which less than most standalone auto gps systems several pdas . pros : -excellent value money . -performs all basic functions good auto gps system , some added ones . warm start times good . -everything you would expect windows mobile pda there . application performance fairly good . cons : -not fast many dedicated gps systems . there times when issue , especially when initially calculating route or recalculting you go off track need know which turn take quickly , traffic . -software interface much room improvement . e.g. not allow you move map see whats around when showing route map . you flip through some screens access . when addresses added contacts contact list , not attempt locate address . it manually located map . -cold start sat acquisition take while times . receiver not so good . -no built connectivity ( modem , wi-fi , bluetooth)bottomline : highly affordable gps pda functionality , one best values money , but not excel either	1

i bought $170 belkin bluetooth gps last year . bundled software quite useful but map display not detailed ( doesn't include rivers , water bodies parks ) enough compare ms pocket streets . it forced me put both programs my pda . one day i cut into website iguidance found its user interface almost same belkin . so i learned belkin software oem iguidance ( rev 1.1 ? )the best iguidance : very clear voice guidance . it advises you next turn many times -- few miles away , 2000 feet , 200 feet ( when you must turn right away ) . i once tried delorme , it told me only once -- many miles away that it ! i only need my ears when driving iguidance . it good safety everybody . if i miss turn , it re-calculate new route tell me what immediately . no panic . improvement iguidance 2.1.2 over 1.1 map details now rival ms pocket streets but w/o railroads . i think railroad useful landmark location reference . connection bluetooth gps receiver also improved . it takes much less " clicks " hook up bluetooth gps now . map data updated . i see newly built highway exit added . map details ms pocket streets still best . but ms two fatal shortcomings . 1 . no voice guidance . you keep staring pda display while driving ? 2 . it locks up time time . ms program freeze pda you must reset pda get it back . i've never experienced similar problem iguidance . " points interest search according your current location " feature iguidance also better than ms . what bad iguidance ? lack routing options . doesn't support voice commands . short , iguidance no-frill but useful tool	1
driving my car , working out gym , walking my dog doing chores around house , i spend least 10 hours week listening audio-books [ ... ] lectures teaching company . over years i've tried tapes , cds variety book readers including ipod zen . no book reader i've found works well this model c140 sandisk . it small , light , inexpensive , easy control , makes bookmarks reliably , makes it easy load unload audible books , makes it easy manage mp3 files using windows explorer . this player takes ordinary aaa batteries you get anywhere . my gym displays several tv screens " hamster room " uses short-range fm transmissions so members pick up station they want watch . so when i see tv program i want i switch over , it lets me quickly easily switch sansa fm tuner keep running . when sansa battery goes dead -- once every 12 hours -- i it takes seconds put aaa battery . they're cheap when i've forgotten put one my pocket , i've gotten replacements road-side convenience stores little convenience rack gym , but i've always able keep listening . audible recommends you download audio-books sansa level 4 format . level , sound quality excellent although , admittedly , player cannot turned up loud enough pound your eardrums unless you plug it into external amplifier play it through good set speakers . i got model c140 replace older sansa e140 i used two years . older one never gave me any trouble but this one said improved operating system making it easier control . i debated getting c150 twice memory only $[ ... ] higher price , but largest books i own ( biography harry truman fantasy book storm swords ) each over 40 hours long , either one fit c140 enough room left two ordinary length audio-books . c140 delivered all i hoped then some	1

first , clarification one listed features . it noted unit stop recording after 5 seconds silence -- this digital only feature not apply analog recording . i'd thought this great feature case i walked away while recording lp , but that just not case . second , it consistantly detect insert track while recording lp or tape ? no , though i it work perfectly few occassions . what frustrating there no rhyme or reason it . it hasn't always dependent sensitivity level set detecting tracks , or condition lp any scratches it may or may not . nothing obvious . positive , i haven't it set erroneous track marks during quit passages , i personally haven't any issues adding tracks manually . quick-start recording guide they provide -- oversized sheet connections 5-step recording process -- once patronizing confusing . i'm all simplifying while still covering bases , but i need line drawing shows finger pressing power button help me turn it ? doesn't " press power switch " cover it ? i mention this because instruction manually adding tracks that same guide far self-evident . their instruction " press track increment button " manually add tracks , but there no drawing finger button . there also no track increment button , no it not skip button . it record button , logic escapes me . you find this out owner manual , which really should read before recording anyway . it short uncomplicated illustrate handy features it . ( mentioned review , you choose analog or digital source you're recording ; default unexplicably set digital ) . quality recordings analog digital quite good . i'd planned getting new equalizer adjusting bootleg tapes upgrading my turntable etc ., but i've become more procastinator than technophile , decided bite bullet this teac . aside missing little high-end , it doing great job converting my records tapes so far . sure it'd great if track detector worked better , but i went into this not really expecting it perform too well , so i'm not disappointed . i wanted uncomplicated machine would solid job converting my records tapes , that what i feel i've got . yes i babysit recording if i want guarantee proper track markings , but that not completely unexpected . , they say , your results may vary .	1

i bought pair january loved them . sound lovely everyone describes . however , there something seriously lacking build quality . soft wires felt flimsy me when i first opened it , but i thought i'd just take extra care . 1 month careful usage , plastic-covered wires earbuds downwards became so weather-hardened i could almost use them chopsticks , makes it so earbuds popped out slightest motion . 2 months careful usage , wires half-ripped plug -- which i repaired best i could unsightly electrical tape . however , 3rd month , left bud fell completely off . i am very disappointed -- it one best-sounding phones i've ever ( i've owned both grado s60 s90 , sennheisers ) , but man , they need something making this baby last	1

overall , helix lives up new generation xm recievers . i especially like option able store my own mp3s unit well recording xm content either time frame or song song basis . only problem here sometimes fades cut off when recording song . those us familiar xm know units not work well indoors unless connected antenna home kit . car antenna seems work fine , par my delphi myfi unit . built antenna helix marginal . i able get decent signal positioning unit , however , when walking or moving reception definitely intermittent . this where my pre recorded mp3 xm content comes handy . i would rated unit higher if helix not falsely advertised able transmit fm receiver both home car docks . prior purchase , i even went far downloading manual which specifically states unit this feature . this simply not true unit transmits fm car dock only . i am enjoying helix , but object purchase fm transmitter home use .	1

i read reviews belkin n-1 networking family scared leave my pre-n system behind . however , my pre-n router died true their word belkin promptly replaced it . this point i willing invest belkin n-1 laptop card just see how it performed . fact i bought 2 . i installed one card couple year old dell which upstairs location while router downstairs . laptop reports very good excellent signal amd " 300 mbps " - it noticable faster pulling files other network devices . other laptop bit older gateway . it too upstairs , directly overhead router . it not report strong signal but seems get job reports faster than " 108 mbps " sometimes " 300 mbps " . while i not experimented placing stronger signaled dell location gateway see how it performs , i suspect difference attributable gateway older technology . greatest challenge i setting up network security . i succeeded security mode wpa/wpa-2 personal ( psk ); authentication wpa/psk ; encryption technique aes ( i could not establish connection my computers using tkp encryption technique ) . summary , setting up network took some effort familiarity networks - how set change properties network connection both laptops browser interface router . once network established its performance reliable faster . all-in-all i would not make investment surf-the-net but if you access larger files , like photographs , computer or network drive , you notice difference - if bandwidth hardware you using par n-1 capabilities . make this come true me i upgraded nic my computers which hardwired router 1gb technology . upgrade worthwhile given my network drive , where photographs stored capable transfer rate 250 mbps my zip drive usb 2.0 . other words , all my hardware capable faster transfer rates .	1
after breaking my cx-300 due it thin cord i decided try out er-6i . those clearest treble i've heard , but lacking seriously mids bass regarding music my ipod . putting it into sound source back home them sounding better , but they weren't good what i would using them , on-the-go listening . so i decided take look these . bass these equivalent cx-300 or slightly better . mids treble where these headphones head up cx-300's; much crisper , clearer , sound more " alive " . thicker cord step up cx-300 , where you could hear everytime cord rubbed against your shirt . noise-cancelling same cx-300 , maybe few decebels more if any . case 3 more pairs buds nice addition compared cx-300 which only come different fitting buds . i own pair quietcomfort 3 home , i'd say these perfect compliment on-the-go listening . my only hesitation giving these 5 stars treble isn't great er-6i ( but er-6i don't overall quality , least my ipod ) . definately use smallest buds work your ear . i've used small buds both cx-300 metro.fi 2 , great results both . it allows monitors sit inside canal , getting better overall sound . i'd recommend these slightly above cx-300 , but both pretty good deals give you great mobility while maintining audio quality . i'm still trying break-in these headphones , but right now , they're sounding great .	1

car charger works just fine . good price . haven't tried ac adaptor yet	1
let me start saying i love these speakers almost more than ipod itself ! i searched every store could not find product all these features ipod shuffle ( 1st generation ) . price also very reasonable product built this well . i've used these speakers indoors outdoors least year now always get compliments friends , family , strangers how good sound coming these speakers . i use speakers outside our deck all summer long enjoy able listen my ipod without headphones . i get much more use my ipod this way . i've taken speakers beach everywhere you could imagine . included carrying case power cord great i use those all time . it definitely important me able use batteries or power cord , this product delivers ! normal aa batteries last very long . it also terrific when plugged into ac ( wall outlet ) it charges shuffle while you listen music . there many other products like this stores , but they sound horrible fall apar t.t his may best product i've purchased last 5years !! i can't recommend it enough ! it also works anything mini headphone jack too ( like any mp3 player or portable cd players )	1
i used these headphones consistently past four years - they far most comfortable headphones i ever worn . aside unique tactile feedback they give , one principle reasons i like them they no block ear canal result you wear them still hear clearly anyone insists talking you while you wearing them	1
ever wonder how many amazon product reviews submitted corporate shills ? case dgl-4100 , i'm ready guess it 85% . okay , i'm not totally serious serious estimate . i'm just disappointed product . i'm not gamer , perhaps that why dgl-4100 didn't work me . i like download tv programs via bittorrent . i download whole seasons time , which runs into multiple gigabytes . you other bittorrent enthusiasts may know , average home network router tendency freeze when bt pulls too many connections through it . i find it very depressing get up morning ( or come home work ) find my downloads stopped short many hours ago . some months now i've search affordable router avoid this problem . considering what i've spent so far , perhaps i would've better off buy something expensive capacious start . any case , it difficult derive any sort consensus router efficacy web . there probably more than few lying corporate shills floating around cyberspace , but mostly there well-meaning people who report good or bad results without taking into account operating system , exact router model , broadband type , bittorrent client , or size torrents they download . i mildly excited find so many positive amazon reviews dgl-4100 . perhaps , i thought , router built high-performance gaming would account connection issues similar bittorrent . right now , cognescenti reading this little tale woe probably laughing their butts off . let me cut chase here . after i hooked up dgl-4100 started two bt downloads ( one mere 1.5 , other 22 ) , everything looked fine ... three hours . then silly thing froze me , happened linksys netgear routers ( wired wireless ) i've tried . i obtained latest firmware it ( january 11 , 2006 ) , installed this , tried again . results similar , except now i noticed router freezing me even during bt-free web-surfing . regardless my bittorrent client ( azureus , utorrent , bitcomet)or its settings , results didn't improve . if you're gamer , maybe you'll roll dice dgl-4100 . if you're bittorrent enthusiastic such myself , you should probably keep looking	-1

hi , i'm vince radioman i've large collection radios i love compares share my thoughts . eton 10 ( e1 e100 ) vast improvement over old grundig line radios . you immediatly see feel difference quality how radio made . it robust memory ( 500 presets ) complete functionality including wide/narrow band selection interference filter which seems work well . tuner sensativity dynamic range very good considering price . it antenna trim feature which pleasure not usually available radio this price range . i enjoy am dxing good results , not quite good sony 7600 or sangean ats909 . sangean priced way above 10 but sony 7600 just bit more but ssb which 10 not . 10s cosmetic design /sleekness wonderful i've said earlier ... well made radio !! control buttons bit small cause issues those us large hands , but not show stopper . my actual rating here 4 half stars , i really like this radio but its not sony , it some hiss selectivity issues , but none less very good buy money .	1

echo most recent review here , i'm something audiophile myself , also sold high-end audio products years ago , buti getting annoyed my new compaq pcwith basic realtek97 onboard audio wasn't even close quality i hearing my newsony dvd player matched set good thx/dolby alteclansing surround speakers , just no comparison . but spend $200 sound card pc that'snot high end anyway absurd , yet i wanted make pc 5.1 digital out capable , boost general stereo audio , when i found out aurilium i jumped it . i got mine two weeks ago i think moneyit really great device , couldn't easier set up , looks fabulous sleek , it even reminds you if speakers aren't configured right , or if you need enable ac3/dolby digital pass-through external dolby decoder or receiver , which really useful touch . software simple , intuitive , helpful easy navigate use . i don't know how philips makes this usb-bus powered , but it works damned well sound card doesn'trequire its own ac power source , although most internal cardsdon't anyhow . test playing new copy dvdof 2001 : space odyssey remastered 5.1 sound , which sounded devastating my main sony surround system , it sounds just good now pc dvd player throughthe aurilium , digital out or not , both methods sounded great . i can't recommend this more highly , wise purchasefor those who want good audio 5.1 digital surroundsound music , movies gaming , budget . plus you don't open up your pc or laptop install it , something i found just icing cake . if you want audiophile high quality go buy yourselfan onkyo or harmon kardon surround system $1000 klipsch 5.1 speakers , but if you , why bother pc audio anyway ? quality pc sound aurilium aces . i also impressed thorough , easy understandnature instructions software help menus , they really cover almost everything you would need know operate card set it up optimal performance	1
i purchased this radio use my garage/workshop . reception good , sound quality very good small portable radio .	1
player perfect money : small , light , good sound quality , only needs replace headphones ... radio ok , but there no memories available store my favorites ... overall very good player . software ( sonicstage-connect ) much more solid than previous version , works fine , it cannot compared itunes ( like many itunes fans like do)does its job pretty well ..	1
i've seen number negative reviews this product , however i think their problem their particular player not model itself . i've my creative zen month now i take it everywhere i go . it works beautifully ! sound quality amazing it so easy use ! my only wish price gone down before i got it it now $20 cheaper . when i first got it it took me bit figure out how manage playlists such but all worked out . i one scare when it froze second day use . reviewer sited same problem , frozen no sound . i don't know what they're talking " waiting 3 days battery die " though . player stuck it only took number hours it die . once i recharged it it worked perfectly i haven't problem since . i use it every day walking classes ( i'm college student ) . my final comment this : price it currently ( $79.99 ) it steal . it works like dream , sound quality beautiful it simple operate . i certainly recommend this product anyone . i went ipod ( which never worked ) creative zen it like breath fresh air	1
i case garmin gps it just belt clip you slide off your belt , unfortunately , it come off your belt ( which it often ) you lose your gps unit good . this explorist case comes real nice strong wide secure strip you undo your belt loop your belt through , so when you out hiking , you don't keep checking afraid it fell off your belt , because there no way this case come off without you taking your belt off ! nice ! it not just loop string or rope either , it better described belt or strip tough material attached real secure case . true , you can't quickly slide case off your belt clip , but why would you need take case off , you take gps out when you need it case stays belt where it safe can't get dropped or lost . $7 this great case . i get gps out quickly easily . i like secure , yet easy open zipper opposed velcro flap my garmin case . only negative i would i would liked padding bit thicker , but i suppose i always slide strong piece leather or something into it inside better protect gps impact case . there enough room this still able get gps unit out without problem . what else you buy only $7 today ?	1
i purchased these set together 6 additional expandable phones . they work great . we large house 6 bedrooms range very good . these phones come great features . i am using voip service these units so far i no complaints . one features we really like intercom . i dont go upsairs get my daughter out bed morning . i just call her	1

it so hard find decent sounding clock radio . this one fits bill ! full rich sound built rear firing subwoofer port . easy controls set two alarm functions . you crank it up any bedroom activities . much better sound than tinny sounding tivoli . much cheaper than bose competitive quality . you can't go wrong here	1
these best headphones under $5 i ever bought , only thing wrong them cord little short , but they fit nice tight around ears so they sound great	1
not buy this your xbox . it sucks . unit functional ( well , not defective ) ' dialing ' unit it able communicate ( w/o wires ) my computer . first red flag when xbox not recognize dwl-g820 wireless adapter . this normal . it configured ip address , which ridiculous because wired router connection normally plug play . however , no amount configuration xbox dashboard would allow xbox connect wirelessly . this even assistance tech support , which spotty best . folks nice enough , but getting through take very long time . i'm okay networks - all my other stuff works great - but definitely not expert , i could go changes i made . i won't , though . if you prefer painless set-up it probably best match brands when designing wireless network . i'll give d-link benefit doubt admit i using router different brand , but all configuration options both ends , this should not matter . oh , i read some earlier reviews i agree this thing runs real hot . who knows what that'll product longevity because i don't plan keep it . if i ever got it function properly i small children , then i'd probably mount it out their reach	-1

when i first got this device it okay it i liked it record xm which i find really awesome . but if you subscription music fan ( napster , yahoo places like ) then here down side this product . if this product supported subscription based music it would gotten all 5 stars but it got 4 but overall sound quality great menues great battery life awesome memory awesome but mp3 subscription music * point fingers down * not good . hopes samsung release firmware update support subscription music cause i don't wanna wait song i want listen play xm so i record it so 4 stars	1

i bought m-audio 49e usb controller keyboard my mac month ago . i'm adult returning piano after many , many years since those dull piano lessons kid . i bought piano few years ago it sits our living room . i'm graphic designer/photographer spend most my waking hours front my mac . i played around garageband thought usb keyboard would allow me sit here my comfy office chair practice while my husband watches tv living room . i miss rich sound real piano , but this keyboard great casual re-beginner practice . nothing fancy , no myriad buttons displays distract lot fun change combine instruments garageband , which excellent software . natch . what else would you expect apple ? m-audio keyboard light , durable , simple sits neatly above my keyboard drawer front cinema display ( which also acts handy music stand ) . only negative i possibly come up springyness keys curve get used . not ever played expensive keyboard , it easy get used this one . practicing simple songs , i no problem missing octaves , dedicated buttons make them easily accessible . my purpose , this keyboard perfect price doesn't break budget	1

fine product what it says . only way i know using one my brother got months ago . he ordered his cc i ordered mine amazon , he using his months while i sit wait amazon . funny thing it states it stock but mine still not shipped . amazon change " stock " " preorder this item " then back " stock " . my order before it went preorder so if it stock now why hasn't it shipped ? according other reviews i am not alone . anyway , samsung decent unit considering there really isn't much competition . however , amazon gets -1 star this one . circuit city , here i come . i may pay little more but least i'll get it	1
after using this product 3 months i am yet find something wrong it . we using it ms streets trips . it works flawlessly . it gets fix ( cold start ) any setting - urban canyon settings , high speeds freeway , wooded areas , inside my apartment . it even works if you keep it glove box your car . we driven through tunnels . it loses signal few meters into tunnel ( not surprising ) gets fix flawlessly couple seconds leaving tunnel . software no trouble communicating reciever . we tried it 2 different versions ms streets trips three different laptops . basic knowledge bluetooth pairing set up breeze . battery life exceptional . it comes complete kit ac charger , dc charger leather pouch . you can't ask more . it really compact ( smaller than most cell phones ) not too heavy either . other gps reciever i tried delorme eartmate . delorme would never fixate signal when driving ( cold start ) . we always pull over get fix then start driving . delorme always lost signal if you drove 3 or 4 storey buildings . hardly described urban canyon ! it horrible !	1

i primarily run outside this great product . it stays my arm i no problem accessing wheel . there 2 flaws , it weather resistant but not waterproof . i never use it anything harder than light rain case very snug so stitching gets stressed . i've mine 4 months i use it 4-5x/week stitching started give one spot . i restitched it , but i would've expected it last longer .	1
i bought this product gift some friends - following directions carefully , they only able get one speakers work intermittantly - after i got speaker system back them , i gave it try - bad results , worse this time - only static one speaker - i double checked make sure i installed everything correctly including making sure correct power adapters attached speakers - no go - , then , when i went return it company whom i bought it canada , i got royal run around - finally after lots phone calls mail issues ( don't get me started " customs " issues ) i returned product got price speakers back - however , no refund shipping either way which amounted $89 total - so ... two things : [ 1 ] product shabby not worth price ( go sharper image buy theirs - better product , cheaper price ) [ 2 ] never buy anything amazon.com not american supplier	-1

i purchased these speakers amazon thinking hmm ... buying speakers online without even hearing them first . needless say , i more than pleased . replacing my now retired polk audio front channels , these jbl e10 just what i needed -- provide good quality sound enough bass balance other speakers . also my setup pair bose 210 rears which work amazingly good , polk audio center channel . others complained high upper range these speakers not great , but if you adjust treble settings your receiver bass ones , you really get it just right any type music . fabulous speakers , even better price ! would definentaly reccomend even purchase set formal livingroom	1

these rca headphones ? what happened quality products they used put out ? i tell you right now , these aren't it . many letdowns very few if any advantages these earphones . spend your money get something else . first problem these earphone how they fit feel your head . since phones not feature swiveling feature like seen most other headphone sets , you put them your head they feel like they're going fall off . you constantly adjust tuning dials achieve constant clear signal . signal becomes distorted or can't recieved all if you go far upstairs bedroom which directly above transmitter or anywhere range . other problems reception include popping noises static within very short distance transmitter . automatic turn off feature which makes this model poor choice . if sound source too low , such certain scene movie or something , headphones shut off within 30-60 seconds . this usually come big surprise you when volume level changes you hear loud static coming speakers which cause most people jump fall out their chair surprise . last problem these headphones battery cover very hard get off back again after replacing batteries . due way headphones attached so tightly band . you fight cover get it up through band . save your money go something else	-1

gps works great ! said , i'm disappointed 5919 overall . i could not get free map updates tomtom because hp not include navigator 6 product code 5915 . hp support promised they'd get maps post them 5915 users , but hasn't happened after several months promises . wireless worked only non-encrypted networks , even then , only 1 day . i perform soft-reset least three times day because system hangs . mp3s play fine . it play video , albeit they very choppy . usb connections computer seem work only after loading very latest ms activesync , only after soft-reset . even then , computer recognize device very " iffy " . unit great idea if you travel -- maps , email , internet , music , contacts , appointments , etc ., but if it doesn't work , it becomes paperweight . i've read dozens forums others complaining same issues . hp support so far nothing but lip service . my recommendation--don't fall marketing hype , this unit still lot bugs worked out	1

this kit absolutely horrible . first off , scratch-free cloths it comes aren't scratch-free all . they totally scratch cd . " step 1 : scratch removal " not scratch removal all . it supposed sit 5 minutes , then you wipe it . i let it sit overnite once scratch still there . after you apply junk , instructions say apply " step 2 : cleaner , polisher , sealer " . this stuff practically water . it doesn't work all . after you cd should like new . i don't think so ! holder you put cd while you're cleaning it too flimsy . only good thing i use " scratch remover " small scratches my digital camera , cell phone , psp , other electronics . not buy this unless you like ruining cd . last word : i hate maxell .	-1

i agree previous reviewer - there lot static interference these things . we actually hardly ever use them reason - our house small enough we hear music other room through walls doorways , least it doesn't sound like am radio stormy day . also , they huge " wall warts " - big converters (?) cords . finding inconspicuous place plug them impossible , since all inconspicuous places behind furniture , which can't put close wall anymore size things plugs . i guess you get what you pay - i would paid more if i known how bad these would	1

i would give this 5 stars but few things : - included earbuds uncomfortable fall out my ears during exercise- syncing sometimes buggy- you load all podcasts manually- podcasts seem ordered date player , no matter how you arrange them itunesrecent releases itunes solved some , but not all , sync issues . also , i read some workarounds podcast ordering problem , but they involve rebuilding your library , furthermore what i've read they're just temporary fixes . apple needs fix this . still , small form factor , cool design , easy-to-use controls make this great product . i sold my 4g 40gb ipod right after i got this , i no regrets .	1
i love it two different modes- you shuffle your playlist or just listen it order you put play list your computer . i also like fact you don't fuss batteries , charge lasts really long time . it very compact , clip holds well . it doesn't take long synch my computer i thought it would , it doesn't take very long charge ( couple hours ) especially compared how long charge lasts ( my sister-in-law using hers least hour every day over month still hasn't recharge it ) . this product gets two thumbs up me . only downside you may want consider ipod nano instead if you want more than 250 songs there	1
this all-in-one printer revolutionized my home office . only $100 , i high quality printed documents , copies , scans photos home exceed capabilities many small businesses . pros : print quality excellent fast . black text works well , several people commented high quality color photos printed just plain white paper . scan quality quite good , easy use . photocopy functions easy use , color copy surprising bonus . many offices very expensive professional printers don't copy color , yet this little $100 machine copies color so well it nearly impossible tell original copy . other nice features include very helpful utilities software included , particularly arcsoft photo studio . i like fact it only needs two ink cartridges instead five so it easy maintain . nice touch handy little slider props unit open during maintenance . cons : my largest complaint this unit high cost replacement ink cartridges , which cost $25-30 each high quality retail replacements . only few months i've spent more than twice cost whole printer just ink . it seems it requires ink changes more quickly too than other canon hp printers i used . other issues , size little wide awkward it feels slightly off-balance weight . print tray should longer support paper -- instead , paper bends backwards awkwardly slide out place . i also wish it could hold more paper . overall : aside cost ink frequency cartridge replacements , i am very happy this printer . previously , i thought home photocopy machine unnecessary ( somewhat decadent ) luxury , but i've surprised many times how very useful it . technology amazing ! printing , scanning copying everything advertised high quality speed . i really like this machine	1

radio arrived right beginning i could tell sound far superior realistic table radio i using . old radio very muddy sounding while tivoli very clear . instruments background when listening realistic now front center . improvement dramatic i'm glad i spent money . added bonus , it 1/8 input jack so i use my ipod it . here few misc nuggets info . amazon comments said am radio reception bad , well you add fm reception if you rely internal antenna . one area realistic beats tivoli hands down . good news tivoli comes external antenna you plug made huge improvement . it comes unusually long extension cord . wrapped up it almost 1/2 size radio itself ! fairly inconvenient when trying keep it tucked behind radio table top . i also read base emphasized too much but so far i it seems fine me . perhaps because i listen jazz which not boom boom some music . one last interesting item , radio very small but also very heavy side speaker . apparently there quite magnet there ! if i critisize it any way i would mention again huge power cord i would also like some type tone control . so , conclude i would say it one darned expensive table top radio $120 ( now sale $100 course ) but it sounds very very good such small box . fact , my wife commented it didn't sound like sound coming little radio all . i don't know i would go far but it fairly open given such small source . dav	1

i received this speaker gift xmas . when i first plugged it , i experienced same problem other people complained ... voices seemed weak difficult understand . i turned db level all way up it became tolerable , but still not very good . i then happened across website discussed speaker placement . it suggested placing center speaker directly above or below tv ( duh ) , but also said make sure it reasonably level tweeters side speakers ( within foot ) . i made this adjustment wow ! it like night day . sound incredible ! those you who problems might want try something these lines , those you checking this speaker out stores should make sure everything aligned properly when you listen . hope helps	1
before buying this product you absolutely go web site try find out if they support your printer . their web site absolutely atrocious . it so slow constantly refreshes so it almost useless . they link back box list compatible printers so go directly it . i hp g85 officejet multi-function printer setup not work all . tech support useless . they kept trying ask me what brand computers i network what my isp . none this mattered except marketing department . it drove me nuts . after 5 phone calls i finally got hold technical support person confirmed my printer not compatible . separately , even if you compatible printer you should aware serious bug software if you use 128 bit wep security your wireless network like we . unless your network uses key 1 ( 4 ) you cannot hook print server into your wireless network . there radio buttons support other keys but they not work . tech support acknowledged issue . all all horrible experience . it shame because their wireless routers almost decent	-1

mousepad side things , this double-sided mat high quality all way around . it aluminum surfaces attached each side thin , but sturdy aluminum plate . i use speed side since it smoother , razer deathadder i also recently purchased . amazon sold out these -- razer store them . wrist rest also just high quality . it actually uses memory foam cushion which much more comfortable than cheap gel material typically found mouse wrist rests . it also dip middle making it very comfortable long gaming sessions . keep this mind if you're considering gaming mousepad . wrist rest optional , but it adds stability ( it large rubber mat + rest , mousepad sits top mat part )	1
unit satisfying advirtised all ways . i thought max volume limitation peak not close what unit could produce , ( maybe least 20% more without distortion ) volume control not go farther than allowed uni t.t he clock dark useless , it not bright enough see any distance . lastly , their no audio out port allow any singals 3 audio sourses play well through excelent speakers shelf size transmited source , it computer or sound sytem . headphone output could used computer input use , but this signal amplified . strange how this missing audio out port some lesser systems , not this one . ( there audio port , but isn'nt sort useless , if this unit 3 good audio sources ? )the unit size fine office , liv room or den not sound sytem giant party , only background music . treble control would also useful , additon bass boost least 10 % , but i suppose bass background more pleasant than treble boosted signals . overall , unit job my studio , price far above others qualtiy , size performance . i assume equalizer would driven price up , well higher max volume level . ( i would paid extra $20 . ) you get what you paid , this system fully advirtised corrrectly	1

we're small graphics agency generic 600x2400 scanner multifunction doesn't come close cutting it our needs film or artwork . this great , inexpensive addition 2400x9600 resolution . would bought brother if they'd similar standalone product , but canon decent alternative twain ocr . software install little quirky if you're experienced user don't want install entire package . it shut down ( winxp ) , so you're left no choice but install it all . we're adobe shop , frankly , don't need everything included ... so , uninstall some software . just annoyance , not big deal . more inconvenient , we use surge protector/power strips , canon still uses big 1990s wallwort covers perfectly good outlet . i'd like see them upgrade bit standalone transformer like pixma ip90 or brother machines	1

cowon iaudio x5 heir iriver player - high-end , get-out-and-push type player people who fussy their music , who don't mind managing it closely . sound excellent , this main selling point . many players referred " portable stereos " . this machine truly . where sound ipod extremely good , iaudio clarity lively presence sets it apart . iaudio boasts some sophisticated audio enhancement technology , but honest , plain sound so good you really won't need fiddle it all . good headphones you hear cough violin bow , or pick out each instruments brass section . it worth ripping your music higher bit rate enjoy improvement , or use uncompressed flac instead mp3 or ogg . luckily , there 60 gb drive your large , high-quality music files sit . controls easy enough manage , though it take little while get used them . all content organized file structure , just like folders computer . when connected computer x5 shows up extra drive , so you copy back forth easily . you transfer any type file you like using file manager , if you don't mind using expensive player storage device , you carry your work files back forth well . music , user interface also file-based , x5 not keep internal database like ipod or iriver . it read id3 tags tell you what file , though it also appears ignore unicode tags . this means you're confined albums ( or folders ) , possibly file names . so , if you want follow particular thread or particular genre , this means extra work . best way listen non-album-based way compile playlists , either creating them computer programs such winamp , or through mastering somewhat quirky dynamic playlists . ( dynamic playlist function doesn't recurse correctly , so you add one album time . ) terms amenities , cowon provides set software tools you use rip transfer content , though you'll probably your own favorites , which you continue use . unlike ipod , you're not constrained your choice software . most useful cowon utility would video converter . device itself attractive , light sturdy . external connections handled proprietary ( easy-to-lose ) detachable connector block . you might want order extra put it away , case these things ever turn out hard find . alternatively , cowon makes dock , which most convenient way set things up . it inexpensive , though it optional ordered separately . screen small , but very colorful pleasing , you choice what information appears during playback . my personal opinion movies belong big screen , so perhaps someone else comment video capabilities . demo looks convincing enough , but again , my interest iaudio ... well ... audio . i bought x5 after many ( happy ) years ipods , no other reason than see what else out there . it always good try something new , sometimes you're pleasantly surprised when you depart norm . iaudio takes some getting used , but overall , it impressive enjoyable machine . i like fact it different , wow - it really sound good !	1

when my toshiba vcr remote starting giving me problems , i decided look into universal replacement . i don't care their usual bulkiness , so this one stood out because its slim-line design . reviews positive price unbelievably low , so i took chance . it even nicer than i'd hoped . it slim , so it handles easily ; it light , buttons well placed . its programmability learning capability allow it anything your other remotes capable , you pretty much place these functions whatever keys you wish ( read instructions first--it easy . i believe reviewer who complained unit only controlling limited number functions not fully read instructions utilized programming/learning capability . i'm impressed what it , which includes everything my vcr remote ) . keys reusable devices ; , key that set up particular function one device totally free new setting when you switch device mode . it isn't backlit , which not particular problem me , but might feature someone else needs . i bought second one . i purchased " 6 device " , then bought " 8 " second , i tell you only difference them two additional device controls --- there no other added functions " 8 " --- but , it didn't need any ( well , maybe backlighting thing ) . i haven't it long , so i can't speak durability , although i dropped it couple occasions it unfazed . it actually seems very sturdy . i guess i'm trying figure out why such low-priced remote so nice . i can't . if you're looking simple , but effective , universal remote , or just replacement or extra one , you won't disappointed this purchase .	1

i'll never buy branded power adapter laptop original manufacturer anymore . i like extra plug - one keep home one keep my laptop bag so i don't constantly grab cord . since price less than buying real sony , hp , or whatever ac adapter , multiple plugs it more flexible , this great choice . when you outgrow your laptop , you still use it . note : don't buy car/airplane adapter only . their little bit cheaper , but most time you'll still want carry ac adapter so you'd end up stuffing both regular power adapter car/airline adapter into your bag . better just buy one " all-in-one " like this keep your original power cord home extra . i haven't used in-line splitter charge cellphone or pda . i'm not sure i find useful since i carry my actual cellphone charger cable anyway - i wouldn't trust not it	1

i got this special amazon ($99 +free shipping ) , which only reason i purchased it . klipsch , i think , little crazy their expectation this system worth $299 . why i think this ? well , terms bang buck , this system falls short - especially when you consider unless you digital source this essentially 2.1 system . 2.1 realm , you find many systems higher per channel wattage than this far less cost . if cost okay , you certainly find more feature packed systems price . any number well-equipped bookshelf systems come mind , including some excellent offerings onkyo denon . i can't comment 5.1 capabilities . if you don't need features , prefer quality volume , then read . audio performance redeeming factor , there gmx d- 5.1 holds its own against traditional audio systems , trounces most other computer audio products . 3 " main driver satellite , this system reasonable chance midrange performance . midrange , while admirable , still sounds anemic comparison my reference speakers due falloff mid-bass frequencies . satellites rely sub help here , which course leads muddy imaging particularly noticeable male vocals . tweeter blends well midrange gives good high frequency definition without too directional , though it might too prominent frequencies above 8khz some listeners . sub gives exceptional performance audiophile , provided you aren't kind person who accepts nothing less than pair 12 your car . notes distinct completely lack rumbling or booming quality ubiquitous low priced . 1 components . extension admirable 6.5 " driver , though output limited south 40hz . system claims 108db spl , while i'm sure possible , anything above 102db it starts losing its charm . this undoubtedly due 1% thd found 10 wpc rated output . 2%thd sub much less noticeable . fit finish exceptional , particularly subwoofer . satellites distinct " ikea-new-age-lamp " feel them , but sub very traditional matte black solid construction . i don't any problems overgrown hockey puck control panel . it fits nicely my desk , though it isn't ideal small workspace . it fit atop sub , should you choose place accessible area . $100 , this system performs exceptionally , overall sound quality far better than most comparably featured systems . advantage diminishes regular price , gmx d- 5.1 melds into pack .	1

when you look picture sony mdr-j10 headphones , you probably think " great idea ! " i certainly , i thought they'd answer my annoyances earbuds falling out while i run . well , that partly true . over-ear design ingenious , there no slippage whatsoever , which refreshing . but design also its most major flaw : most headphone speakers which project directly into your inner ear , but placement speakers this set such they face forward into tragus ( projection cartilage sticks out your ear ) , which means sound inherently distorted . you adjust placement somewhat but , me , it feels like i'm simply choosing less annoying variation distorted sound . what more , overall sound bit tinny weak my tastes . i realize these very inexpensive headphones , but even running , i can't cope such thin-sounding music . after trying these , i switched back earbuds i already owned found it less annoying they fell out occasionally -- after all , they sound great when they stay , which more than i say sony mdr-j10 headphones .	-1

i'm not sure why other reviewers such trouble bass response . i placed both speakers six feet apart foot wall behind them overwhelming bass preponderance . fact , when i equalized sound using pink noise generator , it required significant bass cuts achieve balanced sound still floors vibrate every drumbeat . perhaps it reflects difference taste other reviewers . regardless , these speakers sound excellent my house ( old house , hardwood floors , large rooms ) generate plenty volume while maintaining clarity . price , including shipping , i would recommend them anyone space need speakers this size	1

i purchased this westinghouse 37 " 1080p monitor ( lvm-37w3 ) because i very impressed its ability used both high-res monitor work but also hdtv play ( xbox 360 ) . product itself pretty good -- picture great , colors wonderful . but if you any kind problem this product , it game over . westinghouse digital no online support speak . i've sent numerous emails through their site received no responses over month . i finally got contact customer service agent through my extended warranty service it turns out westinghouse no local technicians even examine your machine . you ship it them ( your cost ) them examine , they said it take 6-8 weeks or more before they get back you . this policy completely egregious -- 2 months time fix quickly depreciating machine it costs customer shipping ?? little research you see all customer service horror stories this product after people it while . go real manufacturer local repair technicians	-1

this cable isn't cheap . so why pay so much it ? why not just buy cheap s-video cable ? because quality suffers . they don't just jack up price no reason . gold tipped connecters , more shielding interference , thicker wire , better quality materials used provides better picture . colors more vibrant , whole picture more defined . you get what you pay , this monster cable definitly proof . i this cable it worth it . monster all way	1

i mixed feelings this product . idea behind it fine -- keep all your cds/dvds one place , away too much handling . problem sony implementation mediocre best . user interface * terrible * ; so bad you almost can't believe they'd release product like this . you need keyboard anything reasonable , " load info dvd " feature barely works . when it , it wrong uneditable . remote control so poorly laid out it almost comical . most important button , get list your dvds , labeled " folders " tiny bad location . plus once all your dvds loaded , then what ? you only support one tv ... i other tvs dvd player car , so i either unload them ( device forgets everything ) , or copy all dvds i need use multiple machines . if you not sure whether get this , i'd consider buying your movies itunes using appletv , or some other similar model . you might also consider any fair use provisions let you keep copy dvds you rightfully own permanent insertion into this device ( although interface still absolutely horrible ) . if remote user interface actually functional elegant , i'd probably feel differently this product	1

purchasing this cable set , you limiting your options . you now must use your a/v receiver sound whenever you play game because you loose analog sound connection you 400 ( analog sound comes out same port video ) . spend 10 dollars you save inexpensive optical cable you now best both worlds , you option using tv sound or a/v receiver same quality video . i say video quality my 62 " hdtv improved dramatically addition component ( red , green , blue ) video gamelink 400 over composite ( one video cable ) connection comes ps2 . however if you're kind person who thinks 450 must better because it bigger number than 400 , it probably won't matter you anyway ..	-1

i bit apprehensive after reading all these negative reviews , but i thought i'd give it try myself , return it if it didn't work ou t.t urns out i am pleased . main thing i bought it watch downloaded avi movie files my tv over my wireless network , it job perfectly . i surprised quality picture . no video pauses or skipping issues . i haven't it lose network once . it simple set up . while it wasn't detecting my wireless network , but then i realized it wasn't units fault , it my wireless network . i just needed reboot router . after it effortless . if main thing you purchasing this video playback , then buy it . it works great . but if your main objective music or photos , it somewhat sub-par . its not unusable , it just could use some improvement those areas i'm sure there better units out there music player . i think lot negative reviews result people setup problems giving up , or people who wanted use it mainly photos or music .	1
usual , sandisk give us great memory card , used all memorystick pro compatible products , like my sony cli� peg-nz90 my sony cybershot dscs60 .	1
after reading other reviews , i decided go ahead get these . especially what they cost , they get job . like reviewer stated , make sure hammer carpet spikes into base before doing anything else . take your time assembling them . drive screws just enough stick out top bottom pieces then line them up holes supports before driving them rest way . otherwise , you risk splitting wood ( or whatever you call what they made out ) . after assembly , careful when moving them carpet or you easily snap spikes off ( it happened me ) . my stands partially hidden behind some furniture so they not noticable . if yours going out open , you may want spring higher end model	1
garmin , edge 305 heart rate/cadence , set standard literally eliminated competition . only thing others this point copy attempt duplicate . we ( 2 ) hr cad . both used flats los angeles county hills orange/san diego county . gps never failed work . actually nothing edge 305 failed work 1000 miles each . you program screen display multiple items glance see all your desired information . i monitor speed , distance , elapsed ride time , time day , hr , cad calories . heck , edge 305 better than bike ! training software also outstanding . only negatives nothing actual computer performance my opinion include : * price-this toy aint cheap . * size-relatively big bike computer , but very light . * battery-our units both safe four ( 4 ) six ( 6 ) hours .	1

i really trying hard love this headset because sound awesome . but ( this big but ) - i couldn't get satisfactory response microphone . problem seemed it never close enough your mouth due it completely separate unit . you supposed clip it your shirt or mount it your monitor enclosed clip device . mic separate it so far away i either set my sensitivity up so high it picked up everything room , or else i yell get it hear me ( then it still picked up lot background noise ) . i take set back get one attached microphone since i mainly play online games my brother-in-law he simply couldn't hear me all this microphone . ( i tried every combination settings various control panels , both game within windows creative control panels . ) pros : - awesome sound- very comfortable- three piece unit ( so you use headphones your mp3 player)cons : - separate microphone poor qualityhighly recommended if you don't rely voice chat gaming ( unless you play your closet )	1
this adaptor fantastic . we actually get better speed -- 115 mbps -- than what we get ethernet adaptor directly , which limited 100 mbps . it pick up signals least six houses away don't even show up my laptop , which intel 2200bg card . easy install even when switching new computer . our nine months old we're still very pleased . definitely good bang buck	1
i decided dust off my old technics direct drive turntable play some records family room kids . i connected it my system , rather high-end naim audio preamp amp kef speakers , it sounded just like you'd expect typical turntable would sound when mated high end audiophile type stereo system . i some research found shure cartridge ( m94 type purchased several years ago ) really didn't get very good reviews , so before buying new turntable i figured i'd try just upgrading cartridge . i chose this one because all rave reviews because reviewers went out their way say how bright " cd like " this cartridge made their records sound . this exactly what i wanted because my system already excels base midrange , i didn't need cartridge emphasizes what my system already good , but rather what it not so good . so i bought this cartridge carefully set it up according instructions . careful get overhang close you specs your turntable ! i washed off played old andrews sisters greatest hits record 70 . horns jumped out me old swing music just rocked my world ! difference this cartridge made like night day . now i've got cheap old turntable wired snooty high-end british system it actually sounding pretty good .	1
i wanted like this product . i really wanted like this product . but i am severely disappointed . when i purchased iaudio this past summer , i quickly learned my unit problems . when i moved mp3 file onto player , 85% time there would these weird skips electronic noise associated it . sometimes deleting reinstalling file helped . often it didn't . so i contacted their customer service , updated firmware instructed . problem still there . so i returned it cowon , they insisted player fine . i sincerely doubt random electronic noise feature , but once they say there isn't problem i don't know what else . so they sent it back me . i've tried it out again , problems remain . lark tonight , i looked them up better business bureau website . their rating . go figure . i would not recommend this product	1

this one great radio . this my 2nd one . i've my 1st one five years purchased my office . great sound , reception great outdoors	1
this unit works great . good buy money . i gave it 4 stars because my situation i use static ip addresses rather than dhcp dynamic addresses . unit intended users dhcp where your system obtains ip addresses auttomatically . there no written warning or instructions it won't work static ip addresses . i called linksys tech support tech very helpful . even though they no written documentation static ip , he knew how it he worked me through it ( which i wrote down all steps ) . most regular home computers use dhcp would no problems this	1

i picked up this receiver $200 plus $40 shipping . price it hard go wrong unless receiver just doesn't work . good thing receiver work works well . auto calibrate function excellent it kept me go through menu enter distances other characteristics speakers . just start calibration , walk out room come back few minutes . component video switching work well although consumer electronics companies ( sony particular ) made huge mess connectivity standards . there so many issues what works what anymore . too many connection types , drm , etc . i would really like plug any device into receiver send all video out tv . truth i can't plug s-video my dvd player composite my tivo into receiver it shown s-video my tv . everything input must s-video or composite but not combination two . but back receiver . it good number audio modes movies , music games . music doesn't sound very good me but could something my speakers . i set my small speakers " large " receiver so they would output more bass surrounds . i 250w sub but getting more low frequency sounds satellite speakers helps fill out midrange . this more issue small speakers than it receiver . i couldn't comment correctly audio performance unless i large set stereo speakers . i couldn't get any output pre-out jacks receiver . this disappointing because i specific use them mind . i also couldn't program remote my tv or dvd player . i fine this issue because i bought universal remote my entire system . one other issue i receiver i didn't like am/fm/xm all selected input same button . makes use universal remote much harder . i would rather button select fm input select xm . , i never know whether i'll getting am/fm or xm when i hit tuner button . i also remove analog audio inputs my dvd player order receiver use digital coax connection instead . i didn't expect receiver default worst audio connection available . overall , i'd recommend this receiver someone who looking buy one this price range . it good selection inputs , good sound performs expected	1

patrick miller " sauropod " already said it better but here take : . if you going buy receiver always go manufacturer web site , click support download owners manual . it tell you far more than amazon or any web site . i this jvc , sony , yamaha onkyo . . also decide if your real priority sound or if you really care video upconversion .. video upconversion really provinceof dvd player or tv . i not think it important receiver . . anyway my priority sound quality . tv boring me . manuals i downloaded all different receivers showed onkyo much more thorough technical specifications . others not , though they hiding something . also very noteworthy , if you take close look , this bottom line onkyo very similar amplifier specs top line model . it also vast majority sound processing modes . so this choice .. i tempted buy jvc because it only one five band eq unlike all others which only bass treble . jvc also more attractive functional remote control sound level each speaker without using onscreen menu . jvc also nice feature allowed usb connections computer . jvc would won if they better amp better speaker connectors back - they only ones used cheap push clamp connectors .. yamaha also good deal around $300 because it preamp out connections but it too seemed lacking .. i figured $200 today delivered this good deal money i saved i could use buy one new receivers hdmi 1.3 year when they relatively debugged ..	1
if your looking small necklace style mp3 player you cant go wrong iaudio t2 . i use it everyday work most time i dont even know i'm wearing it . it size makes it very unabtrusive no cables get tangled up . battery life decent 10-12 hours per charge . it its minor problems though . it sounds very good , but supplied headphones could better . thats also problem , if you use pair headphones you lose its necklace ability . navigating takes some getting used well . dont let negatives turn you off however . it very good product	1

i read some reviews this reason i'm writing this . i purchased two these units almost 3 years ago they operated flawlessly me . i them connect together no-delay feature there no gap music . soon song ends one cd deck song starts other . i 390 cd each unit . during christmas holidays they full , 400 each . reason i take christmas cd out sometimes i like play both units full random , all disc , shuffle . who wants christmas music all year long . both units operate advertised . so if you like me couldn't decide which cd put smaller cd changer ( i 5 disc changer ) , or though cd you wanted hear . now problem solved , i access 800 cd .	1

i would very wary positive reviews this product . i find it hard believe such piece garbage could thought so highly . first off , you must hold top down get item laminated through machine . this would minor inconvenience if this only problem . really bad news laminate bubbles horribly , it hazy rather than clear . how anyone would use this photos beyond me . next , magnetic backing doesn't stick all whatever your laminating . it just falls right off . there absolutely nothing worthwhile this piece junk . i bought this based reviews others here . shame them misleading people this way . if you want use this arts crafts type toy pre-kindergarteners , maybe . serious use , never . spend extra money get quality heat laminating machine	-1
i wanted keyboard use w/ my media center pc , which hooked up my tv my living room . like others mentioned , mouse pointer device not work well . but if you change mouse setting control panel slowest or second slowest setting you find it easier navigate . just sitting your couch mostly using media center or doing light computing this fine . mce remote functions keyboard very handy , keyboard works great , mouse pasable . but if you trying any kind activity requires extensive use mouse then this definitely drive you crazy	1

i purchased this cable so i could watch satellite tv my portable dvd player my computer . you probably need adapter convert rca-style connectors mini connectors most players . there doesn't appear any loss signal quality , even though cable very long . video wire pretty thick , so probably helps . nice cable good price	1
these speakers rate 5 stars ! very clear midrange treble . tight relatively deep bass . these speakers very good imaging sound ' dynamic ' . efficient so not lot volume needed make them play loud . speakers sound best ' loudness ' but require no other treble or bass adjustments . they listened least 1 hour per day . i am average hearing . speakers mounted stands which 4 feet off floor . these speakers receive my full endorsement great sound . bic dv62cls ( center speaker ) reported leading consumer magazine others whose opinion respected sound even better deeper bass but twice price	1
note : this copy review i posted red model this radio . old ( silver ) grundig/eton s-350 phased out . ( see my review s350 ) . eton s350dl series replacment ... more this , visit website " passport world band radio " ( passband.com ) under " receiver news : update edition 2006 " ( near bottom page ) . s350dl ( headphones eliminated package , see s350dlr , s350dlb s350dls ) then drop same price old s350 . right now , some older stock s350dl ( headphones still included ) sold off cheaper than normal price ... shop around . i not own s350dl , but it reported this model reduces " drift " problem observed s350 , provides stereo reception through headphone jack . perhaps eton now offer this radio more colors , since it dropping silver model ... nice " electric blue " or " emergency yellow " like they use some other models ( crank-power pocket ) would go well blue display illumination	1

i've using this mic couple years record round-table conferences , hearing room situations phone depositions - sometimes distances 15-20 feet or more ! only wear tear i've noticed sticky underside mic , which helps keep it place surface , partly torn off . not really problem . sound quality equal , if not better than , more expensive mics i , some costing over $a200 . added bonus labtec 333 no battery required , which means : ) you don't remember turn mic or off ; ) no fretting replacing batteries or not sure if they running low ; ) no unwanted feedback into some equipment , sometimes caused powered mics . pricewise , i personally don't think there better mic market .	1

i like look my macbook pro , so i keep it ( fairly ) clean am very careful it . however , keyboard one those problem areas hard clean , particularly notebook computer . i looked several more intrusive ( adhesive ) scratch-resistant solutions , but i found protouch best option me . because my main focus keeping system clean , i wanted able remove it , clean it off , put it back , while knowing whatever dust , gunk , etc ., it collecting wasn't getting into my keys . protouch works fabulously this purpose . silicone not quite transparent , but pretty good job letting macbook pro color shine through . some reviewers complained mbp keyboard difficult see cover some conditions . i no such problems , least far protouch concerned . mbp keyboard , because its keys designed allow light through , hard see low-light conditions -- this unavoidable , not really fault cover . remember clean it regularly , though , or oils such protouch transfer screen . it reversible good cleaning monitor , but still disappointing	1
i submitted review earlier ( follows ) . however , i've become very disappointed operation this unit . specifically , it stops showing remote temperature frequently . nothing wrong remote . i remedy problem removing one battery main unit , then replace it wait it correct itself . ** end edit ** original review follows still applies . rri installed unit just after denver christmas 2006 blizzard . i used standard batteries remote but still able read -11 deg . later , unit stopped transmitting ( see other person review ) . i replaced remote batteries it worked fine since then . i might go lithium batteries next time . real drawback , my view , smooth , curved display cover . it reflects light all directions makes it difficult read unless you move around or move very close . product would better flat display cover and/or etched cover ( reduce reflection )	1
i using this mouse work since it came out . after many miles use , scroll wheel finally started fail . i now spin wheel several times before screen actually scrolls . best feature this mouse battery life . coworker who swears his logitech mouse would change his batteries every couple months , but i usually got least ten months out mine . i even took dating batteries when i installed them , just rub it . this mouse bit heavy not slide well some , but overall i would recommend it . going try rechargable logitech next time around	1

i've 2820 month now taken several trips , some where i've known route few where we charting new ground . most part street pilot performed well we got destination . however , when i used it guide me locations i'd previously it didn't always take me way i thought it should . eventually street pilot recaluated route would catch up way i going which during past travels i determined fastest way . regardless it performed very well . one case we tried program garmin location it didn't recognize , even though when we got there it all streets etc . provided acurate directions other locations spot . i e-mailed cartography department advised them what i saw they prompt responding solution when i programmed it , it got me location i looking . i noticed if your programming alternate route use cities data points route garmin wants take you center city you use data point . i'm sure there way program garmin so it doesn't , but i haven't time figure out exactly how level trip programming . if fact there isn't way you'll just get used hearing speaker continually say " recalculating route " . thats just minor annoyance benefit street pilot . sometime you may need search cities near where you want go get directions . i looking tierre verde florida , but needed type st. petersburg . regardless it worked cartography department quick respond . overall i'm impressed garmin my next purchase xm receiver manuver me around traffic tie ups . this product gets my recommendation .	1
i am returning it . bluetooth signal keeps fading out every 45 seconds or so . when it worked , it great , but not single song went without dead air problem 3-4 seconds then it would reconnect start playing again . i contacted logitech customer support they sent me email 3 days later suggetions completely different product . then i called long distance them stayed hold 14 minutes only told it sounded like it defective i should return it . not very satisfying customer service experience ; i high hopes this product ; i may order one later see if my luck any better then .	-1

this warranty purchased through amazon , but it actually distributed company . when you search tv warranties amazon , you see 4 warranties appear same , but different prices . i called company sells these warranties asked what difference . they told me there no difference $119 warranty $499 warranty ; they cover exact same thing . girl i spoke even asked her manager he said there no difference . warranties tricky item review , because it all looks good until you actually need it . so , this one , i suppose only time tell . one difference amazon warranty electronic store warranty amazon one not replace first bulb tv ; but i figure if i need replace bulb within those four years i still saving $100 because i get new bulb around $200 .	-1

my home theatre reasonable system any measure better than most . however , my wife re-arranged living room furniture one stroke my cherished system made redundant . my two rear wall mounted speakers now my left no possibility mounted somewhere else . it time look polk yamaha products . unable audition polk surroundbar yamaha ysp-1000 a/b comparison , i consequently decided purchase both , idea i would eventually keep one sell other . i now both units 10 weeks when doing my a/b comparisons , both systems set up so one speaker sitting just above other , playing same material instant a/b switching via remote control . note - it takes quite few readings instruction manuals eventually understand how set them both up properly . after comparing lord rings , pirates caribbean , pink floyd pulse variety cds music videos , my assessment : 1/ . both products produce satisfying sound field effective watching movies ( albeit very different ways ) . 2/ . my living room ( which pretty " live " ) my equipment polk , they both sound remarkably similar . this big surprise me . cds some music videos , most noticeable differences sound mostly due subwoofer performance . 3/ . either system produce effects equal 5 channel system discrete rear speakers ? course answer " no " . neither these systems produce rear surround effects distinct those generated rear surround speakers . but so many ways this question misses real point issues these products successfully address : 4/ . let me rephrase question : both systems produce big sound field envelopes you , similar what one might experience real cinema ? answer " yes " you hear convincing surround sound effects intended movie producers , immerse you into movie thus enhance your enjoyment ? once again answer " yes " . 5/ . if you want decent home theatre sound but cannot install multi-speaker surround system or you simply don't want , then these products solution work . 6/ . after reading forums net , i idea polk going sound better than ysp when it came music . actually cds etc , they both sound same , similar tone , both produce big sound , go loud each other ( very loud indeed ) . nothing distinguish one really better than other , assuming polk coupled quality surround amp sub . surprise here yamaha it myriad " tiny " 2 watt amplifiers comfortable really loud sound levels . 7/ . which better ? both plus minus points so it isn't clear cut . yamaha ysp-1000 matching yst-sw225b 150w subwoofer : -plus points : -+ guaranteed great sounding home theatre system . yamaha engineers made sure . + in-built power amplification ( this termed ' active ' speaker generally desirable configuration)+ decent pre-amplifier functionality eg volume control ( db level displayed ) , bass treble control , audio video input selection ( selectable 4 sources ) , auto-room equalisation , plenty surround sound modes , ir signal pass-through , remote control capable macros etc . fact ysp-1000 remarkable amount technology literally stuffed into it . + more effective producing distinct surround sound effects than polk , especially when set up it " ideal " configuration . ie centred against wall square room . + ysp effectively compensate corner position ( contrary notion ysp works well only when ideal environment)+ remote control other manufacturers products . + all you need extra dvd player tv . minus points : - requires side rear walls . - looks bulky industrial , my opinion not attractive addition any living room . - titanium colour ( more like dark grey ) not good match most silver big screen tvs . - remote bit frustrating times , too easy wrong control mode , eg you find yourself changing tv channels when you may intended change surround mode . - no hdmi input/output- cannot transcode composite component video signals . you committed all composite or all component input / output video signal pathway . ( not really problem if every device you connect ysp video inputs composite video out . )- on-screen menues only available composite video . so if you decide go all component video pathway best picture quality , you then lose your ysp on-screen menues . - no s-video inputs - probably impossible owner tell if any 40 speakers/amplifiers inside cabinet failed need replacing . - should dvd player built . polk surroundbar : -plus points : + looks great , visually complementing most big screen tv sets very nicely . + not require side rear walls your listening room . + similar yamaha respect it capability produce big , convincing sound field . + would make excellent choice " all-in-one " right/centre/left front speaker conventional surround system . minus points : -- requires investment 5 channel home theatre amplifier plus subwoofer- not guaranteed great sounding home theatre system . polk full potential could easily compromised `weak link " resulting poor choice ancillary equipment . - surround effects never really localised , rather you hear them originating hazy , general area , comapared yamaha which creates more convincing localisation effect . 8/ . conclusion : good looks - polk surroudbarfor rooms without side or rear walls - polk surroundbarfor square or rectangular rooms , even ysp corner - yamaha yspfor " most bang your dollar " - yamaha . ysp both sound good ( remarkably similar ) probably end up costing same set up once you add necessary ancilliary equipment polk . my particular situation i am trying rid my living room many boxes possible . consequently , if polk managed squeeze pre-amp power amp into their surroundbar charged accordingly , then polk would my first choice . it just looks much better than ysp unit . unfortunately they haven't , so yamaha stays i'm now selling off polk my existing denon amp , bw sub anthony gallo speakers	1
if you've seen this piece local stores you've probably heard they come assembled . well , amazon version requires assembly . while it wasn't too difficult or time consuming ( maybe two hours including disposal/organization packing materials ) , it would nice know it . aside assembly , quality look cabinet great . definitely worth sales tax savings get it through amazon - plus you get feeling accomplishment once you've put thing together	1

this single device could potentially everything i want .... if it all worked . ( rev ) . specs great which what made me buy it , but like most d-link hardware , it very poorly executed rushed market . major issues : 1 ) occasional ' freezing ' random disconnects several moments while browsing folders2 ) no option automatically boot back up after power failure3 ) upnp-av not sort alphabetically . this makes playing entire folder alphabetical ( or chronological ) order impossible . 4 ) tech support seems focused turning around emails ( albeit slowly ) , not doing any actual tech support . 5 ) extremely noisy fan ... i mean ridiculously noisy ! 6 ) no option edit email server port number email alerts7 ) overall poor quality , should lot more testing before released public . not bad price , but if you don't need all these features one device , look elsewhere	1

this television outstanding picture quality considering it price . you can't find better value than this tv this price range . my xbox 360 looks fantastic over vga . some older lcds you worry ghosting lag , but i not encountered any problems it . now complaints ... ready realize how bad standard def looks ! once you've seen things hd , you won't able look your grainy sd signals same again . also , channel changing bit laggy ( minor annoyance . ) menu also bit wonky difficulty navigate , but it it job fine . i would like few more controls over picture . i like you update bios via usb	1

i am not technophile , but after 8 weeks looking all options pricepoints , i knew much more than people retail stores . i first bought 46 " sony aquos it terrible variety reasons , most notably it really bad vertical horizontal banding , extent i started noticing flaw tvs wall retail stores - there simply no excuse kind thing leave factory . there other user-unfriendly issues too so aquos went back . i've this 6 weeks it great . swivel plus , though i disregarded my purchase . on-screen navigation friendly logical , puts controls your hands , versus some dynamic brightness default parameters aquos which bothersome . i haven't time figure everything out it yet , but it hooked up my 10 year old onkyo stereo , it all great ! amazon service delivery went fine . buddy mine analyst major bank followed amazon years , pushed me go ahead take leap big ticket item purchase . i am amazon fan until they cause me otherwise	1

first all , thanks amazon not listing dimensions this ... it 38mm deep , not 25mm like other 120mm antec fan my case . only reason i bought it cause i gift cards needed one , so i thought why not put antec fan my antec case . wrong , it waste my gift cards . it just too loud . i sonata case this loudest thing there ... it even hooked up psu fan controller power cords , which supplys minimal power . it just too expensive noise . dont even think connecting it regular 4-pin connector , i tried this it sounded like jet engine my room ! it probably woke up my neighbors	1
i bought this magellan 3000t took it still box vacation melbourne fl . i read directions plane it seened very easy set up . so i go set it up my rental car . i take out power cord it doesn't look right . side plug goes into magellan isn't round shape like it should . it shaped like trapezoid like end cable goes usb computer magellan . i accidently plugged it into usb port magellan . i'm lucky i didn't fry thing . well i called magellan customer service i spoke someone country ( outsourcing ) accent hard understand . i explained box came wrong charger . representitive hard time believing me . i read serial number charger cord her she placed me hold . she confirmed i received wrong cord . she said she would ups it me i would receive it 5-7 business days . i explained her i vacation needed use it now wanted it overnighted me . she refused . after getting rather firm her ( put it nicely ) , she put me hold again . she returned after 3 minutes said she would send it ups 2 day my hotel . i agreed would ok . well tuesday friday it still not there . i checked out hotel monday called customer service soon i got home . she gave me tracking number which indicated it delivered friday . i told her hotel sais they never received it . i called hotel again they checked again said they don't it . well magellan customer service tells me i sould track it down ups . i told her go track it down herself it would easier me return magellan place i bought it . just purely bad customer service . i lug this thing back forth couldn't even use it . i also got lost driving disney drove 40 minutes out my way . i am completely fed up magellan . i only gave it 2 stars instead 1 because maybe it would worked well if i could turned it , but i'll never know . well i ordered tip my igo charge magellan it works fine . price i paid ($250 ) i'll overlook my frustation say pretty nifty , if you don't mind paying extra few bucks charger . first time i tried update software program locked up . second time charm . i see others complain it not able play music function gps same time , who cares . i bought this so i won't get lost . i ipod listen music . why people so hung up electronics multi functional .	1

this 3rd gps unit i owned i am bit disappointed . first off , " intergrated traffic monitoring " means unit shipped garmins add-on gtm12 device . this device not integrated needs attached 370 operation . bluetooth integration useful , but volume quality built-in speaker not great , making it difficult hear callers . units detour feature also more limited than other units i owned . instance it not allow user view chosen route exclude road . you only able exclude road you currently driving . other than , maps fairly up date , poi database lot information screen pretty decent most light . finally , like most other units i used , it tendancy pick routes not optimal . example it may route you through middle city because it shortest distance ( mileage wise)to destination . this fails take into account multiple traffic lights inherent congestion add huge amount time trip could much quicker if route chosen . if you must nuvi , save your money buy 350 ... added features 370 not worth added cost	1

this product would answer all my problems if it weren't few fatal flaws ; 1 ) it not support ' multifunction ' keyboards ... their technical support informed me this includes any keyboards include volume control , internet buttons , etc . you know , kind come most modern pcs sold today . i don't use those buttons keyboards cheap - i'd willing just buy new one except : 2 ) mice wheel buttons not supported ( according their tech support , this also constitutes ' multifunction ' device ) ... so if you gamer ( or just like wheel button ) , prepare replace your gaming mouse plain vanilla 2-button mouse . 3 ) their tech support pretty awful ; they seem checklist devices unsupported ( despite pretty standard most pcs market today ) , seem more interested finding reason why your configuration unsupported ( thus ending call ) than actually working you . my mouse working both pcs but just little choppy one , but once support person latched onto fact it wheel , they unwilling waste second talking what might causing problem if anything all could fix it . it too bad , it even slick looking little device . i give it two stars because it indeed switch back forth two monitors	1

first , i purchased my 276c september 04 which means i've using 3 months . it purchased replace my garmin gpsiii i used around 6 years . gpsiii still works great but no detail maps available no turn turn directions , but basic lat/long it still works perfect . i compared 276c garmin quest , magellan roadmate 700 , garmin street pilot series . i wanted it portable . meaning i could use it car , boat , or walking/hiking . basically i wanted able use it just anywhere , just like i used my gpsiii . this quickly narrowed my search down 276c quest . others mentioned above strictly automotive gps units . besides size , i couldn't find anything quest over 276c . 276c certainly bigger but i liked additional screen real-estate . 276c purchased automotive adapter everything i want it it well . however , i 3 complaints keep it getting perfect score my book . these not really any particular order importance . #1 proprietary memory stick only go up 256mbthis memory stick holds all map data helps you find addresses specific sites . one comes automotive kit only 128mb . you can't just go get one these anywhere because it proprietary design . 128mb one i enough storage download all map data austin , texas las vegas , nevada . we drove vegas austin november 276c worked great . i wish it wasn't proprietary design or i wish they least offered larger model would hold entire us . #2 cheap , cheap , cheap car adapter . i read this review site before i bought mine . they right . threading holds fuse place plastic . pulling unit out car power plug puts stress threads . mine broke last week but quickly replaced authorized garmin dealer . this item you can't just buy anywhere because car adapter built speaker . i don't expect new adapter last long either . i move mine cars several times week . #3 file this one under very picky . if address your destination one way street 276c try route you around block so you come back down one way street . this fine except when location really corner one way street entrance side street . unit literally route you right past side entrance next street allow you go up few blocks so you come right back down location one way street . i don't know if automotive only gps units would handle this situation any better . that it . we drove over 3000 miles our trip november used 276c extensively whole way . regards , alan	1

note : this copy review i posted wr-100b , which appears nearly same ( check both listings best price ) . i live oregon , which not noted severe storms , but i really caught " off guard " last week when severe thunderstorm large amount hail blew through . severe weather occur almost anywhere ! shortly after storm , i ordered one these weather alert radios keep me more aware any local hazard could pose threat . radio itself quite sensitive , provides reception several more distant weather stations not picked up less sensitive receivers such general purpose ( am/fm/tv/wx ) sony 410 ( see my review sony ) . big deal here weather alert function ... radio set silent until it receives specially coded message noaa weather station . radio programmed respond " codes " one area or several , so you adjust your " zone protection " suit your needs . when warning affects area you programmed ( setting specific same codes ) detected , loud alarm or flashing light or voice alert sound ( your choice ) . if it desired hear weather report , just push " weather " button unit listen ... very much like those old radio shack " weather cubes " very popular 20 years ago , but better reception . everyone should one ( or more ) these	1

i find it strange memorex dvd-rw reviews here favorable , while same time memorex dvd+rw reviews complain bad media . last year i bought memorex ram disk well memorex dvd-rw disks use my toshiba d-kr2 . i believe i only one bad disk out 10 or so i used . they lasted over full year through dozens dozens recordings eventually degraded , no complaints here time i probably would given them 4 stars . however i recently bought pack 5 memorex dvd-rw only 1 5 formated ( hence rating here ) . i also recently bought pack fuji ram disk first two i tried not work failed several tries formating . unfortunately , i bought these best buy which notarious their lack customer service they refused accept returns these . so , what going here ? why we letting these manufacturers get away selling products sometimes work some machines fail most time others ? where six sigma attitude when you need it ?	-1

grundig g1000a good beginner sw radio . it relatively cheaper than other grundig models , such e5 , e10 , e100 intended demographic lightweight , travel , light usage , and/or beginner sw radio . grundig g1000a wonderful overall simple figure out . you just chuck guide away , except shortwave section , you figure out all dials within 10 minutes , alarm time switches just like any standard alarm clock , use dial right frequency , one left volume . there connections left off switch ( which very tiny ) right . dials well placed good grip , making them easy turn . off switch easily accessible . it may little hard adapt if you've used previous radio different positions dials , but it isn't hard adjust . helpful alarm clock sleep option built . sleep option makes it possible so radio automatically turn off within set amount time 1 1:59 minutes . alarm turns radio , so you listen whatever . important : you must first disable alarm pressing alarm on/off switch then if you want turn off radio , then you . this neccesary because radio not turn off because alarm still " going off . " people just getting hang sw radio , there guide helpful sw frequencies per band it . audiolistic point view , speaker this radio not so great . if you really wanted get great sound , you would just get some good headphones or better speakers . but remember , you listening radio , which specially fit programs such bbc npr , which don't lot music or anything requires high quality speaker . i give it 4/5 because it not over top radio . it works just fine meets all my expectations , but personally , i use 5/5 something totally blew me away .	1

i bought this mount fairly heavy ( @100lbs . ) mitsubishi 46231 lcd screen - this mount could easily take twice weight . mount well engineered plenty adjustment wall stud spacing . i left plenty cable length so we could just pick up screen , hang set , tuck excess cable wall . worked like charm due simple design mount . two different depth mounting bars included - if using smaller bars keep set closest wall ( 1 inch ) , your outlet directly behind panel , you need wall hugger plug adapter . i would buy this product again	1

after thoroughly researching , i walked into circuit city expecting buy sony 26 " model kdl-26s2010 . however , after comparing 26 " kdl-26s2010 32 " kdl-32s2010 , 32 " model better value . consideration feature called wcg-ccfl described spec section . after side side comparison 32 " kdl-32s2010 ( no wcg-ccfl ) 32 " kdlv32xbr2 ( wcg-ccfl ) , wcg-ccfl produced noticeably superior picture , mainly due higher contrast ratio deeper blacks . i didn't mind paying slightly higher price improved picture . also , salesman suggested i compare sony comparable samsung several hundred dollars less expensive . samsung picture appear slightly better me , but sound little thin compared sony i also liked sony aesthetics much better . one other point others might find helpful ... i get cable service but they only offer 2 4 major networks hd . so , i purchased philips hd antenna(model phdtv3 ) apx $50 ab switch alternate cable air sources . after autoprogramming two sources separately , i now receive 17 hd stations over air ... free . switching cable air 3 step process involves selecting input or ab switch , selecting cable or air menu settings then selecting digital/analog remote control . this sounds little confusing , but it actually easy . worth effort i now view hd programming all 4 networks , 2 cable 2 over air ( not mention other 15 " air " hd channels ) . finally , i strongly suggest hooking up surround sound system so your ears just entertained your eyes .	1
got one jan . 2007 . overclock it 3.4 default voltage daily use . it screaming fast rock stable . compared e6300 , multiplier e6400 8 , so e6400 much easier overclock . 400mhz 8 = 3.2 . this means pair normal ddr2 800mhz memory overclock this baby 3.2 . my experience , e6400 also overclock better than e6600 , although it $100 cheaper	1

system where i store backups archives failed . i needed some way access data 300gb drive there . not time or inclination troubleshoot system , so elected try nexstar lx external enclosure . use week now . installation - could not easier . manual comprehensive includes photos could better , but adequate . includes screenshots software setup explanation each screen . step-by-step good complete . nothing missed , nothing left question . space inside enclosure tight . but , there enough room install drive route cables . one photo illustrates exactly how fold data ribbon so it fits snugly neatly . functionality - good thing : includes usb 2.0 port so you use it like normal usb external drive . plugged it , powered it up ( ext power supply ) using ( good thing ) power switch . stood right up under winxp pro sp2 ntfs formatting . so i able grab critical backups data temporarily move them drive my system . beyond compare ( http://www.scootersoftware.com/)was great here . when complete , used tray icon remove drive power down . removed usb cable installed network cable . note : while powered down , i made point entering nexstar lx mac address my router mac address filter table . this not covered docs . so if you any peculiar network settings , like this , docs not address them . when i turned drive , i followed instructions open web browser page enter \\storage url address line . opened up login dialog box configuration pages . not really much here . i try exiting after i completed see if it would recognize ntfs formatting . it would not . so i re-enter nexstar config utility format drive . took couple seconds 300gb drive so guessing it " quick " reformat . i used included smb server screen create folders . again , could not easier . just experiment , i password protected one . still very easy . use - folders created i ready start using network copy/move files nexstar lx drive . i set up shares systems my network use folders nexstar . easy , worked very well . i used beyond compare copy files folders my internal drive over nexstar check everything " same " . i'm pretty much ready settle down normal use . fact i manually weekly backups work notebook last night it like using shared drive my desktop backups . folders recognized , backups moved swiftly everything worked advertised . notes - when i using usb connection , fan so loud , i sure i would need hearing protection same rooom it . i'd read this other reviews . i removed cover see if would help . it not . course , i move case around change usb network cables connection . after i , it whisper quiet . case plastic . i little leary this . but it sturdy not really " chintsy " . very nice finish ( i black case ) . i wonder if i not shift something around when i moved case unplug usb connect catv may rubbing fan . now it no louder than simpletech usb drive next it . if it continues perform it now , i'll very happy solution . addendum : 03 nov 06 - i originally wrote this 26 aug 06 . since then , nexstar lx performed flawlessly . , it very quiet . i left default setting let drive sleep when not use . so when i first access drive there momentary delay while it spins up . once it , it runs just fine . i am backing up several different categories files ( my shareware library , mp3s , images , etc ) almost every night week cobian . this combination i dreamt . i could not more pleased . i could not recommend it higher .	1

i'm not big writing reviews , but i certainly enjoy appreciate reading them , so i figure it only fair i give back bit . let me preface this review , saying i'm hardly videophile . i lot research before making this purchase spent lot time lurking avs forums , but before , no idea what black crush , mura , handshaking , clouding , stuck pixels , banding , etc . etc . let alone how identify them . personally , i happen think lot folks over avs perhaps too critical . my amateur eyes i , however , very satisfied set recommend it anyone looking high-quality , reasonably priced lcd ( kudos amazon once again offering great service basement prices ) . proscons excellent picture audio quality - rich , vibrant colors , good contrast sharpness . i used sound video disk callibration tool tv really seems nice job little tweaking factory settings . standard definition broadcasts , while they can't touch their hd brethren , more than adequate my purposes . we farily inexpensive polk surround sound system set up , but speakers tv sound pretty good themselves ! stylish looks - tv looks great living room comes useful stand those who arent interested wall mounting . intuitive onscreen menu remote interface - tweaking factory picture settings must , tv makes it pretty easy task so . i also bought logitech harmony 880 universal remote use most time now ( which i also recommend ) but included remote solid . i wish it buttons go directly source you want use ( hdmi1 , hdmi2 , etc . ) . only thing i don't like set - it more my setup than flaw tv - there glare fish tank our living room . lcds usually better than plasmas glare department but this one specific panel which gives screen pretty ' pop ' but also heightens reflections . it only noticeable me during dark scenes , but when i notice it , sometimes i trouble refocusing picture . also , set seem some trouble details dark images ( black crush i referenced earlier ) . over avs forums , there lot complaints hdmi handshaking problems where screen flicker or drop out every so often , but i haven't any issues . i've connected time warner hd-dvr box sa oppo upconverting dvd player ( recent amazon purchase which im satisfied ) using cheap hdmi cables ( yes , also purchased amazon - no wonder they just reported great quarter ! ) . i not however yet ps3 ( its wish list ! ) which seems where most handshaking problems coming . anyway , wrap up , i'm very pleased purchase . it great option those who looking lcd set around this size that future-proofed hdmi 1.3 1080p	1

( i packed it great lots padding ups wouldn't picked it up if it thought it wasn't ) . now i am out $235 extra costs although ups gave me $100 back my damage claim without checking it out . they then sent me supposed " new " replacement only worked black white-no color picture . they offered 3rd tv but after first 2 , i screamed hollered , no success niko , but tiger direct people nice enough return my money after hearing my problems manufacturer . ps their remote sucks you find no code works your cable/satillite remotes so you use both-if you get tv works great , but if it breaks down---don't expect help	-1

this tv lot going it . nice looks , good picture . if you want replace 27 " tube tv , this set you , 4:3 image 27 " this set ( unstretched ) , you won't damage it watching black bars . course filling screen movies hdtv gorgeous . here some many positives : +strong digital tuner ( brings every digital channel la radioshack table top antenna pointed through multiple walls ! )+amazing hdtv picture digital tuner+many inputs means plenty options ( i mine hooked up my laptop via vga , my satellite via rca , hdtv antenna via coax)+satellite hooked up over 50 ' rca ( composite ) cable looks clean progressive dvd . means very good color decoder scaler . +good dvd upscaling , though i notice slight jaggies when compared hooking up computer set native resolution display letting computer scaling . considering how much more processing power computer , you can't fault tv . but if you htpc , dvds look their best played through . but there minuses : -red bias color decoder means you turn color setting down below optimal compensate . looks good , but could better . i may go into service menu see if this fixed manually . -horrible analog tuner . satellite sent over channel 3 , which looks great other tv sets , looks bad this set , but same picture sent via composite rca looks amazing . -fussy menus , could more logical , functional . -no direct input addressing . -no direct digital tv addressing . you must use auto setup , which time consuming , add channels it missed if you didn't your antenna pointed well . then you go back delete channels you don't want second time . -can't get black blacks without compressing darks . this typical lcd problem , though all companies claim fixed it . none seem yet . -smart stretch pretty " dumb " it noticeable spot where picture stretches . not fluid like panasonic smart stretch , course , some brands don't it all , but still could improved . after owning panasonic plasma setting up my sister panny plasma panny lcd projector , i know how smart stretch supposed look ... ;) -why remote so huge !!! why it so limited what it operate ? you program satellite tuners , example , but not directv or dishnetwork , two largest us providers . why some important buttons , like sleep , hidden behind door unlit ? light button doesn't glow dark , sleep button unlit . it if sharp doesn't understand why remote lit begin . -buttons top set means if you set top dresser or other tall piece furniture , you can't see buttons all . would better side set . but none those minuses worth looking elsewhere , sharp outclasses all others , especially this price . so buy this tv what it best , don't expect black blacks or good analog tuner , you'll happy	1

lc37d43u my second sharp aquos this year i say i cannot think any reason purchase any other brand lcd television . when i purchased other one ( 26 " )8 months ago i not hd yet only bought tv because physically it fit my needs so when i got hd boxes comcast last month it sort gradual transition . 37d purchased replace 32 " crt my basement . i prepared hd box getting rid damn coax cable plugging hdmi cable when tv arrived set it discovery hd channel . plugged tv into power strip , hit power button almost fell over how gorgeous picture . almost every other person reviewing lcd hd , i say sd tough look when switching hd channel , but 5 minutes after channel change picture standard channel still looks substantially better than crt ! i also want mention 6ms refresh rate . i know lot people don't put any credence this , but i see lot complaints ghosting reviews i read other ( mostly 8ms)lcd . i watched 20 minutes hockey game last night which substantially more fast paced than any football game you could watch it clear , vivid completely lacking any ghosting or weird imagery ! 6ms refresh rate ?? i'm no expert , but it seems like valid feature me ! pros : -2 hdmi inputs ( finally i take advantage this my dvd player)-easy use remote-default settings options any configurable criteria . mess around picture , volume or input settings make mistake ? hit reset button start over ... beautiful !! -sturdy constructioncons : -switching hd sd sd hd channels takes little longer than i would like image needs resize , but switching hd hd sd sd fast you would normally expect . this may normal , but i not see it 26 " . -the remote not any codes i could find control motorola cable box comcast hands out hd . ( if anyone out there knows fix this i would appreciate it)again , this my second sharp lcd 9 months i would recommend this brand this model anyone wanting solid , quality lcd tv !	1
i way too many tvs my home ( including two other samsungs ) but i needed small tv guest bedroom . our cable provider provides all local tv channels ( including all hdtv channels ) basic cable , clear -- without se t-t op box . catch , course , you need tv built-in atsc tuner recieve those channels . this one few small tvs i've seen atsc , although most it end year . setup incredibly easy - plug power , connect antenna ( or cable ) let tv its thing . my samsung found all available channels added them its memory 10 minutes . i am also impressed this tv flexibility -- it accept just any type input signal , including hdmi ( 3 ! inputs ) , component , good old composite video . picture quality very good , built-in speakers surprisingly good . i also like samsung new all-white case design . i older 23 " samsung ( also white ) my office , this set much nicer looking .	1

many radio fans familiar legendary grundig satellit line shortwave radios , dating early sixties ... e1 satellit 900 , even it advertised magazines 10 prototypes ... eton took over finally released it early august 2005 ... after satellit 800 mess , i wasn't expecting much , but after couple days ... its winner , just ordered second one sharper image they seem only one them ... here few observations ... e1 arrived almost hour ago , playing it ever since ... if you radio enthusiast , stop whatever you doing , order one before stores run out ... this one very special radio ... i now understand why pc two already ... whatever shortcomings eton marketing dept certainly made up engineering production depts ... most you already know " features " , so i'll comment my impressions things i've noticed ... - fit finish ... beautifully detailed , operating radio ... i see no fit finish issues all ! - sound ... full treble bass not distort sound normal listening levels ... would describe it " crisp punch " . - display ... awesome ! ( sorry jay , nothing compare this one ! ) . very clear bold dark readable digits evenly backlit light gray background , dark gray digits -- unlike tiny scrawny faded v21 digits . when off , there clock well over 1.5 " tall digits ... turning it puts tiny clock upper right corner , station number shrinks 3/4 " . i should mention there continuously variable contrast knob located under battery door ... station visible across room ! - tuning ... smooooooth tuning ( no notches ! :) depending band , 3 different " speeds " -- slower speeds add digits after decimal point , greater accuracy . - dx switch boosts 10db -- enough bring one my favorite low power big band fm stations ... really makes noticeable difference ! - all jacks left side except xm antenna jack which all itself right side ... interestingly , xm jack located what appears removable section radio two visible screws backside -- maybe future upgrades ??? - almost every feature some type adjustment via screens ... example , you adjust amount time snooze/sleep switch , well so many more features . i'm sure i discover much more tonite when i get more time play ... who knows what i find owner manual ( very clearly laid out i might add ) or dvd ... hardly wait xm antenna see what other tricks this radio up its sleeve ! ray	1

i've using this player nearly month now truly love this unit . it physically very small ( many ways it smaller than ipod nano ! ) sound quality quite good even headphones creative provides unit . inclusion built-in display very useful , especially when you configure internal features unit . because it device works under microsoft " play sure " specifications , you also play back drm-protected . wma files downloaded many commercial music web sites such ones offered wal-mart yahoo ! music . i would recommend couple things though -- consider getting rechargeable aaa batteries since unit use up aaa batteries fairly quickly also maximum sound quality , get good " ear " earbud headphone such panasonic rp-hje50 available amazon	1
yes , you use ordinary mini-dv tapes this camcorder but there two good reasons paying more : 1 . video encoding format hdv cameras ( mpeg2-hd ) problems recording fast motion . this leads " drop-outs " but you reduce these using better tapes . 2 . different tapes different lubricants . if you use different tapes your camcorder , you end up jamming your tape transport . decide one product best suits your needs stick it . this tape special lubricant so it probably not good idea mix ' match it even other sony tapes	1
