eugene o'neill play " long day journey into night " pulitzer award winning , autobiographical play his family . i must admit though eugene o'neill considered some father american theater , i not enjoy reading this play . tyrone family insane dysfunction their constant bickering apologizing very annoying frustrating read . i also disliked fact after four acts continuous yelling tension o'neill offered no conclusion . day life tyrone family gets progressively worse until it finally peaks play just ends . no happy ending , no hope future , just despair . " long day journey into night " wholly depressing read i really could without . however , after learning more eugene o'neill background , extent which play based his life , i began greater appreciation this play . o'neill lead very hard life , therefore frustration despair i felt while reading this play demonstrates o'neill talent engage his audience convey emotions characters very real manner . while o'neill depressing end not satisfy my craving happy ending , it appropriate play eugene own family never got happy ending . i like clever way o'neill showed tyrone family desire but inability forget their troubles through dialogue . beginning play audience presented normal , loving family . audience soon however , gets suspicion something isn't quite right , family tense . slowly family skeletons exposed through arguments family members , but characters always feel regretful bringing subject up . thus showing no matter how hard tyrone family tries pretend all well , their skeletons always them resurface continually remind them truth . although i still believe " long day journey into night " thoroughly disheartening read , reader emotional response this play leaves no doubt o'neill exceptional writing .	-1

i clearly not share enthusiasm some reviewers here , who all forgive me thinking susan cooper " dark rising " plain awful . this book recommended harry potter fans who run out hp books read . i must say it waste my time read " dark . " never i read book which no physical description given hero . this case , we told his 11th birthday , english boy named stanton discovers he last " old ones . " unlike jk rowling who , first pages harry potter philosopher ( or sorcerer ) stone , provides reader vivid description harry skinny , unruly mop black hair , startlingly green eyes , , course , lightning-bolt scar his forehead , cooper not describe stanton all . result reader , after read 244 pages , still cannot visualize what looks like !! i also find quite annoying cooper approach this good vs . evil tale . she vague abstract till end who exactly old ones , who or what exactly dark . dark evil , all reader succeeds gleaning dark means cold , snow , -- course -- darkness . excuse me : but this best cooper ? this what this book ? -- druid pagan worldview light vs . dark , summer vs . winter , warmth vs . cold ? what happened conception evil moral evil ?	-1
i agree reviewer who said this work boring . it seems roth trying glorify philip roth not characters . he goes describing overwhelming feelings zuckermann " swede " , without letting us know who swede really . roth should let characters tell story or try use less erudition his narration . it gets point where reader loses interest finishing book . i loved plot against american because it more character based than philosophizing historical context times	-1
expose power hungry woman not give hoot civility compassion . riveting its revelation anna wintour icy personality even sun cannot melt ! though it not official autobiography , it well researched consistent views given most 200+ interviewees who worked or contacts anna directly good enough sound judgement anna character report card minus 100 anna personality traits !! those who think official autobiography would it more justice , i would say anna wintour would probably give very skewed account her favor would make it more " unofficial " than this unauthorised one . it makes you more determined than ever never work these abnormal people who show such traits . if earth needs sacrifice some human beings aliens invading solar system , anna wintour would surely make it top hit list people get rid !!! :)))))) i find it incredible there willing sacrificial lambs willing work this woman hell ! i just think those who work , constant contact or live her their morals twisted beyond belief , they no longer differentiate what right or wrong ! good example this would bee shaffer , daughter anna wintour , who recently remarked british newspaper , daily telegraph , which bee monthly contributor , her mother nickname " nuclear wintour " just myth ???!! excuse me ??, bee this sayquote bee daily telegraph , uk dated 5 oct 05 : " but it such myth me . she just comes into office she goal : she wants produce great magazine , which i think she . you work very hard she very direct what she wants . i don't think makes her ' nuclear wintour ' or whatever they call her .	1
i very much looking forward recieving this title amazon.com after reading first few pages online . , admittedly , i like first few chapters ; however , tone style presentation changed very quickly , became almost smug self-aggrandizing . authors seemed far too pleased themselves , , approximately halfway point i felt if i reading some kind bizzare conservationist manifesto . i like think - self-appointed conservationist vegan - i try mind mother nature all living creatures , but after i finished reading this repetitive , pedantic bore , i lost care . maybe i am too harsh , but this book seemed peak first chapter ; then , it became exasperatingly preachy redundant . others liked book , that fine ; but i disappointed	-1

this book excellent explaining labyrinth arabic grammar . it wisely introduces verb forms groups consistent vowelling participle formation which easiest format i've seen so far . it explanations remarkably clear . i think advantage since one authors not native speaker they able explain clearly other non-natives what native speakers probably take granted . it also consistently scrupulously vowelled ( essential grammar text book . ) other users remarked however , book not without flaws . conjugation charts wretched . everytime i look them , i get confused forget how conjugate verbs . print quality , others said , not greatest . vocabulary end each chapter bizarrely not alphabetical order ( english or arabic ) order seems quite random so looking up words pain ( there decent root-based dictionary back however . ) indeed sentences exercises quite stilted . check out this gem : " we described all these events you so you may know piety preferable despair , we put our ideas our many letters you during period two years . " come again ?? ( this before translation . ) still , they designed illustrate reinforce grammatical concepts they quite well . interestingly my teacher , who native speaker , hates book because stilted wording bad examples- e.g. illustrate 10 verb forms , they use some verbal variants don't actually exist . finally , it really bugs me they use egyptian style printing final " ya " which means they don't put dots underneath . thus , it looks identical character alif maqsura . there whole chapter defective verbs ( those end wow , ya or alif ) authors actually say " look how ya changes alif maqsura some these examples . " well , actually i can't tell guys because you didn't dot your letters . absolutely unacceptable grammar book designed non-natives would make this omission . despite this book flaws , this excellent guide arabic grammar especially considering other options amazon price you'd hard pressed find better deal . if you studying your own , there also teacher manual available	-1

although anne made some excellent points , it still one-sided . she still speaks republicans general better which wrong because many them just hypocritical democrats ( some worse because they know what god commands but don't actually care ) , although she gives some explanations why republicans better party , they deceptive wrong . example republicans better because they promote chrisitianity specific their arguments : yes , true some ways , however many promote false christianity make it look bad because many them not truly christians but putting up show . needs said otherwise people get impression often all christians hypocrites it all financial gain or vain glory . merely specific argument doesn't make argument better . example i say , " democrats out get your kids poor because they want raise taxes poor give tax cuts rich want force children learn white wash " but so called republicans like george bush want too . i would like say this good book give young girl , because it shows you still fememine , wise , christian , yet not fool or knowledgeable emotionally immature ( other words nerd ) , but it too many big errors . it helpful howewver everyone general who wants know what wrong some type arguing how argue constructively . although she doesn't give thorough explanation subject , it very good concise . i just happened comforted her words because day before attacked vagueries pastor aog church	-1

all-time favorite mine , capitalism freedom creates framework classic liberalism argues forcefully favor free-markets decentralization over expansion government involvement economic social affairs . friedman builds his argument ground up identifying coercion state distinguishing feature over all other societal organizations .

it mark twain who popularized aphorism benjamin disraeli there three kinds lies : lies , damned lies , statistics . i kept hearing all these marvelous things freakonomics , book steven levitt stephen dubner , so when i ran across it 25% off , i stupid freakin ' thing bought it . i thought , what freak , i've got pretty inquisitive mind i'm open seeing things differently , discovering new viewpoints . doubt started early when i got book home i first noticed glowing comments dust jacket likes time , new york times , washington post , los angeles times . when all liberal news agencies lining up tell me how wondrous certain publication , i'm immediately going freakin ' suspicious . author malcolm gladwell tells us cover , " prepare dazzled . " well , evidently ol ' malcolm dazzled whole lot easier than i am . ( i won't even mention smug mug stephen dubner taunted me book dust jacket because i don't want you get idea i judge book its cover . or this case , writer his physiognomy . so i won't mention . ) if you're kind person who amazed learn 70% auto accidents occur within 10 miles driver home , then you just might dazzled freakonomics . if i tell you company issues its 5-day-a-week employees only 3 uniform shirts , thinking it cutting costs , probably increasing its overhead , this fact astounds you - if you must ask " but how ? " - then yes , buy freakonomics dazzled . mostly what freakonomics offers ( when its conclusions trusted ) just what we used call " common sense . " but since america reduced bunch corpulent , brain-dead zombies staring vacuously box survivors , american idols , lost knuckleheads , good old-fashioned common sense now appears dazzle dead ( when you sever them box put real book their hands , ) . i dove into freakonomics hoping find my purchase worthwhile . i got no further than page 13 when my fears realized : everything would require second-guessing verifying . page , smug mug tells us ( based single report institute medicine ) " drinking eight glasses water day never actually shown thing your health . " fortunately , i read your body many cries water doctor . batmanghelidj over decade ago so i already knew what bunch bunk . chapter 4 , smug mug " proves " legalizing abortion 1973 roe . wade decision responsible national drop crime rate . this represents centerpiece his book , both literally ideologically . first thing reader must accept there really significant drop crime since early 1990s . page 92 , author acknowledges police atlanta discovered underreporting crime early `90s hopes landing 1996 olympics . well , would police forces nationally incentive underreport crime generally if it actually dramatically increased since `90s predicted ? true , honest might means increased budget , but it sure would make your department appear inept unable maintain control . surely chamber commerce big business interests would frown public perception . let me ask , you actually feel you're less likely victim crime now than you early 1990s ? that funny , me neither . there so much crime now some what once reported police agencies goes unreported , recently , ex-police officer friend told me cops no longer engage some micro-policing they able `80s `90s because crime so out-of-control now . dismissing other possible factors responsible huge drop crime ( if this claim verity ) , dubner states increased police personnel accounts only 10% drop . bit more insight into nature police work than average civilian , it funny i find myself even contending stats smug mug uses actually work against his theory : i believe wide-scale hiring police officers since early `90s could impacted crime rate only minimally - less than 10% - while actually increasing municipal coffers via traffic citations significantly . dubner concludes righ t-t o-carry firearm laws " simply don't bring down crime . " ( sure read utterly fascinating book , gunfighters , highwaymen vigilantes roger . mcgrath , decidedly different scholarly viewpoint ! )in dismissing all explanations unexpected drop crime except legalized abortion , i didn't notice any mention tremendous increase homeschooling proliferation private schools since early `90s , i wonder if might some statistical bearing . ya think ? yes , i think smug mug selective . he calls some abortions " crude drastic sort insurance policy . " not " immoral . " not " sinful . " but then i didn't expect smug mug call sin sin . even if levitt dubner hypothesis correct , abortions lowered crime , fact remains not every aborted child would eventually murdered innocent person , but every aborted child innocent person murdered . so why we even discussing this ? i'll tell you why : because pro-choice folks feel slightly shifting consensus , now they're pulling out all stops , trying " statistically " convince masses they're safer all those unborn potential criminals missing . i find this repulsive ! ( there studies indicating those missing people , continue , negative economic impact society . ) i won't even go into chapter 5 , what makes perfect parent ? suffice say usual ( surprise ! surprise ! ) all statistics dubner employs nearly always seem confirm rightness liberal dogma each issue . funny how those crunched numbers always crunch conservative beliefs . just know if you're working mother , you haven't cheated your child least , but if you're dad who thinks occasional spanking order , you " unenlightened . " if your kid watching lots tv , it isn't turning " child brain mush . " ( no word whether or not it turning his/her morals mush though . ) studies ( we called pay attention ) show " child character wasn't much affected whether or not he sent day care , whether he one parent or two , whether his mother worked or didn't , whether he two mommies or two daddies or one each . " ( i've often wondered what might happened me if my mom , who home most time , hadn't there hammer dangers drugs into my head day after day , year after year , while i growing up `60s `70s . ) i've given freakonomics two stars because i find section naming children very interesting , well story stetson kennedy fight against " three ks . " but if you're smarter than i am , you'll borrow this book your library rather than paying money it . economically speaking , that just " common cents . "	-1

far shakesepare comedies go , " comedy errors " always my favorite . while this " you like it " never quite obtained popularity " midsummer night dream " or " taming shrew , " one probably could argue " you like it " best shakespeare comedies . this play contains several plots shakespeare cleverly intertwines it offers happy ending love triumphant . but more important than triumph love , theme reconciliation carries through virtually everyone story . story begins sibling rivalry orlando his older brother oliver who hoarded family inheritence . after brief fight , oliver hopes orlando may accidentally die wrestling match against charles . this where 2nd plot comes . duke frederick ( who daughter celia ) banished his older brother ( true duke who daughter rosalind ) . but now , rosalind allowed stay she made good friends celia . orlando meets these 2 girls falls into favor rosalind . after wrestling match , things start go bad . orlando learns his brother oliver planning kill him , rosalind banished . but all not lost . orlando takes his loyal servant adam flees while rosalind ( male disguise ganymede ) , celia , comical touchstone flee look rosalind father . here where play becomes mostly comical . ( good comedies often sad start . " comedy errors " shows this well . ) moving , we meet rosalind father his crew who made exile into paradise . duke sr party , we meet melancholy jaques . but he arguably most interesting character story . ( fact , most famous passage this play belongs jaques . 7 stages man which end nothing . perhaps macbeth took lessons jaques : ' tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow . ' ) duke sr welcomes orlando adam , it isn't long before orlando rosalind run into each other . shakespeare maintains comedy when rosalinde keeps her male disguise tells orlando he must practice wooing him/her . touchstone some comical romantic moments audrey . there interesting triangle where shepherd silvius loves phebe , but phebe loves rosalinde ( seeing only ganymede) ! we may recall this " 12th night " when olivia loved viola her male disguise . but after this comical moment , all begins resolve . oliver comes scene he celia fall love . ( so much so oliver willing reconcile orlando grant him all . ) play ends not only reunion rosalind her father , but joyous weddings rosalind / orlando , celia /oliver , audrey /touchstone , phebe / silvius , but more good news comes . celia father mends his ways returns all rosalind father . jaques offers crowning touch . despite his cynical nature , he not villain . ironically , this hermit type man converses more characters than anyone story , while he not take part play final happiness , he wish everyone well . i said , my favorite comedy always " comedy errors . " but don't make mistake overlooking this comedy	-1

if i didn't know any better , i'd swear this book written satanist . author seems rejoicing prospect armageddon , including mountains blown up destruction all world cities . i bought tatty copy one penny i somewhat surprised see 1973 it its 27th printing . it seems reasonable then assume mr lindsey views fairly representative mainstream america . if that case then suggests plenty americans keen armageddon erupt middle east so " good christians " may whisked off private audience . christ while rest population burns . i would recommend this book all israelis . his book last days israel , zionist author barry chamish declared israel main enemies european socialists . well , i reckon hal lindsey his fans present greater threat . it seems likely if supposed temple solomon not rebuilt israel isn't annihilated then lot committed christians going most upset . bit " good news " lindsey book surviving israelis convert christianity such passion they like " 144,000 billy grahames " . it seems committed christians charge both uk us governments us government could described theocracy . i wonder if theocrats share views mr lindsey , who states this book each arab generation hates israel more than one before , which would good news it would mean they would more likely attack initiate armageddon cause return jesus christ . russia portrayed villain book , but " red china " " red chinese " get look-in chapter entitled " yellow peril " . book however contain one true statement , page 120 : " religion great blinder minds men . " frankly , i hope " rapture " happen soon . sooner people like hal lindsey whisked off face earth , greater likelihood peace world	-1

i've software industry quite awhile , i've watched personal computer industry evolved one where there dozens machines sold consumers down two primary platforms windows macintosh . while there no doubt macintosh minority platform , there also no doubt its continued survival engendered unexplained amount hate those who not fans machine . this book , summary , longwinded rant one such user . someone who knows first hand number situations covered book , who generally solid understanding situations not covered book , i believe author this book sat down wrote it out himself without any fact checking , without any real interviews ( or he ignored or misunderstood people he interviewed ) . there so many factual errrors this book , its not funny- -from little things like years events happened or locations companies or person who held particular role particular time , grossly innacurate assumptions things author could not possibly know -- such minutes boardroom discussions . this smear job , thru thru , like most smear jobs its repetitive , self-contradictory , downright dishonest . i think only reason author not sued doing so would give this book far more attention than it deserves . windows fans like kick apple mac , even when they down . windows seems engender some sociopathic sadism people . if you want learn more apple , find book ... this book just windows fan bashing steve jobs taste	-1

okay , this book out long enough there more than one review , so show my support , i add one here since i missed his book tour sf mere two days . i can't believe it . i just don't read newspapers all anymore . didn't book come out august ? but they wouldn't tour him august . it like december : business shuts down like jewish girl after her wedding night . just well . what would i , anyway ? lurk ? smile ? try say something unusual charming ? not gonna happen . book tours exhausting so speed-dating author series blurts too much . best read his blog his site his own name . i'll remove this review later because i like private ( i remove all my reviews ) , but this cockfight book , quick stabs , perfectly designed actual writers attention spans too short actually read real paragraphs anymore . it got so much teeth-baring energy irreverence someone who handle running into anyone street . we're talking courage , baby . no cowering here . [ way , writer/artist friends , read rollo may courage create see this all diagrammed out . ] eszterhas ' last book , hollywood animal , started out fine me , but end i wash my face afterwards . there just too much anger testosterone before he wrenched himself his previous hollywood life . he escaped hand-in-hand naomi his kids safety ohio like von trapps " sound music . " but perhaps bad-writing stories too close home , i felt same way nyc publishing world i sprayed my vitriol into many folks ' eyes , too . it burns like mace . but you can't imagine how it feels us inside . times like those , we one shrill ladies jerry springer . one . you hear me ? that very bad , bad place . splotchy skin , fishbelly texture all . ( don't you get springer pin up calendars ? )so i read around reviews before buying this hardcover . i'm cheap my own library readers who wonder why i quit writing books . too many books my excruciatingly tiny apartment it . so i also read joe queenan ny times interview , but i smile condescendlingly all through it , because writer , it really just smacks jealously bitter sibling sarcastic riff . ( when someone sees peer excel breaking very rules they've so assiduously following , it blows their cotton-picking minds they might've cheating themselves all these years . ) it cute little review , but i think critics just snide wannabes who should forced write each review gynecological chair , showing little pink room full people eating cheese talking cell phones . artists forced take take take again every word like sweet young thing our first night clink . but i like idea queenan fine . i miss philadelphia terribly , think everything everyone there great . except main line . it hard funny or cool main line . geez , thread count cityline avenue alone rivals finest egyptian cotton sheets . but he lived city once , right ? worked there ? bought four pretzels dollar once his car ? anyhow , i don't know where he lives but his writing smacks main line : well-to-do middle-aged guys trying just little too hip , surly , smug when there absolutely no longer any reason angry " young " man . if you afford frog , i don't wanna hear any bellyaching . our personal thread counts tell no lies ... besides , whole philadelphia area , anyone who knew john debella since ' 80s , when he wmmr head-to-head howard stern , knows he only one who gets play card all happened his wife all . talk your life publicly dragged behind old pickup truck fun . old " louie louie " parade yore should just parading him around everyone shoulders once year . but what i know ? queenan funny when he writing impossibility doing his own thing like trying make original $7500 movie under guise trying take down yet artist , robert rodriguez ( tsk tsk , looks like somebody needs hug , queenan ) . but queenan mere boy . it eszterhas who dirty dozens -- verbally disembowel best ' em any street corner -- still parts intact saunter off any actress who happens passing . so too bad he got sit there take ny times article like someone who his home number written truck stop bathrooms all over world . i feel him . there no back alleys critics . rest us ? -- yes . / critics ? -- no . they jam their thumbs their ears wiggle their skinny little weak fingers air skip off into night . ( ... where special chair ? )so i'm glad see readers stepping up giving eszterhas last word . it beautiful thing see artist triumph over ubiquitous critics his audience . i think posters aztec warriors around here ... eszterhas standing mountain top ... loin cloth pinned together regulation no . 5 brass fasteners . only two . formerly long malibu-blond hair blowing mountain wind , scantily-clad screenwriters napping his feet . anyhow , i surprised how much i like this book . it what it . i cringe while hearing creepiest side hollywood where scientologists ( religion cyborgs cash registers ) thrive next blockbuster producers , women seem plastic straight-faced janet jackson treat themselves like blow up dolls . it horror movie we're eating what they're farming ; i get so tired all those boys down there literally metaphorically poking all our faces , collecting our heads like shish kabob . but when i read it life advice writer , i'm ecstatic don't want it end . i'm always struggling where put tantrums my life like punctuation . if that what you want need , then don't listen any critics or people taking eszterhas down peg or star . it deserves all five stars just its relentless audacity . but hey , it pert ' darn near un-american not want bash anyone who much anything --- heck , it even hard me not joe queenan bash any baby boomer who ever more than one house when most us barely come up insane down payment one . ( i so don't wanna hear or see any more documentaries or books your " good ol ' days " ' sixties ' seventies , when rent bottle beer free-love hug . you all free time world stare ceiling , lovin ' , make " ground-breaking " art .... blibbedy blabbedy blue ... ) . but my pale , quivering writer friends , take him down ( new snide way we've all perfected ) your own peril ! reading this book like knocking back whiskey smoking too much our sailor suits , back bar eszterhas before he says : " okay , kid , i warmed holly ' up ya . go there show ' er how it !... oh , uh ... way , quit smoking . " --- then sends us off hollywood pick up where he left off , our shaky knees -- but blustery hearts . who cares whether you like his movie work or not ? that absolutely irrelevant most people know . we're all puerto rican here , whether you speak spanish or eat smoked herring also irrelevant . we writers spend too much time hunched over , writing others getting proverbial girl -- even if we girl . but we rarely swagger real life get our own girls . but he . smarmy or not , you've gotta hand it guy holding his own . this book doesn't need cover , it needs cod piece . all that relevant . we need this call war . because technology boredom what out there , things ' changing tectonic shifts taking place we've got psych ourselves up writer power like any self-respecting black panther would've ( back day before their name became used hip hop clothing line ) . there special way dial perfect combination so you " make money without losing your soul " he writes . but i'm almost forty , don't clue what it . i shake my shoes ask " what ? what exactly would jesus if he wrote his own book tried sell it ? " even though i haven't foggiest idea , i go make muffins because i figure jesus would make muffins because they hard make ( read : " sacrifice " ) , they make people so happy muffin kinda ' way ( read : " giving " ) . few weeks ' time , i'll back my old self , but here california , you've got least pretend you're outwardly " nice " every once awhile , some widely-accepted faux-spiritual zen-buddhist bowing way or they chase you up hill eat you like guy liz taylor/kate hepburn movie , " suddenly last summer . " ( yeah , yeah , hipocrisy abounds here . but you put up lot sunshine . ) anyhow , that what this book joe like : hungarian muffins . sure , there occasional shard glass , but it makes your teeth sharper . makes me happy . i'm terrified go back out there business because i don't care how spiritual you fancy you , when you're finally busy you've living ramen noodles so long your kitten danger around thanksgiving time , holly got you her electrically-heated embrace --- oh my oh my oh my -- it so hard think straight . vonnegut once wrote something nature surviving often creepy because survivors usually questionable things order survive . true . history full prematurely dead people who right thing . how you balance keep your ear against wall hear click right combination ? i don't know , but i'm gonna sleep this book under my pillow so i benefit somebody else hindsight 20/20 all " if i knew then what i know now " cliches . writers gods . i still can't believe movies " " director . it silly . but that what one last writers ' strikes , yeah ? they blinked . then they caved . eszterhas doesn't cave . i don't even think he blink .... because screenwriters gods .... not gazelles disemboweled serengeti . same bravado , i've writing my own first novel into my own screenplay myself , am calling my production company " monster girl movies . " i need all whiskey memorable eszterhas lines my head i cram there . so , you what you want . i'm running out energy time so i'm joining eszterhas union . not blinking caving union . everyone needs " i am god !

string theory formidable subject learn , both physical mathematical standpoint . but it even harder subject teach audience non-experts , not because its ideas hard express verbally front this audience , but because its practitioners sometimes feel it beneath them so . those who not familiar string theory but curious its conceptual foundations might therefore left themselves pursue understanding these foundations . however such understanding obtained , there late few books written experts string theory targeted readership strong desire learn subject . author this book recognizes paucity expository material string theory , particularly dealing mathematical formalism , although this book polemic against string theory its status physical scientific theory , author introduces ( perhaps purpose ) reader theory way understandable without sacrificing scientific accuracy . but book could also interest more advanced readers , i.e. those ( such this reviewer ) who thorough understanding physics mathematics behind string theory but who not conducting research it . author demands rightfully scientific theory must testable or least must some amount empirical predictions . he pulls no punches his critique string theory , very open what he thinks motivations behind those who actively involved it . researcher motivations course not germane validity theory he or she proposes , but they relevant understanding why particular theory entrenched scientific community , even though there no experimental evidence it . this reviewer disagrees author his claim string theory not " beautiful " theory . it mathematical formalism used string theory gives it its beauty . indeed , just algebraic geometry alone employed string theory example this . combined differential geometry , complex manifolds , algebraic topology makes string theory beautiful multi-faceted mathematical gem . said , there many ideas string theory deserve classified " speculative " mathematics , author this book . this classification arises because presence ubiquitous path integral , object resisted rigorous mathematical formulation . so yes , mathematical formalism behind string theory beautiful , intoxicates those who contemplate it . but physical theory must more than just " mental masturbation " ( characterization imputed physicist murray gell-mann book ) . it must also make predictions measured laboratory , these measurements must reproducible above all understandable interested parties . author not find any these predictions string theory it exists present time , he correct his claims . those who worked academic setting understand fully negative reaction author received when manuscript circulated review , which he describes some detail book . this criticism course anonymous , following usual practice research community , such anonymity temptation recklessness vituperation , author gives examples this . so book not only describe some ideas string theory , it also goes into social interactions attitudes among string theorists . it would unfair say all string theorists arrogant protective their status academicians . but those meet this characterization position cannot morally justified . discovery scientific truth demands transparency not only because complications theory , but also because those who not directly participating it responsible it financing ( taxpayer ) . string theorists , all scientific mathematical researchers morally obligated report their discoveries those who not their field manner makes it crystal clear what they all . string theory should not collection documents protected interpreted small body privileged priests knowledge .	1
philosophy , international labor , high tech , economics , globalization , internet virtual universes all neatly wrapped together this book . it very successful telling mr. dibbell what going right now ... not just mmo world but many aspects society . it so fascinating me read . he not hype up metaverse phenomenon . but , he make it bit less complicated . you really get message what currently undergoing not trivial serious implications how we all live our lives . play versus work , lines getting more blurry . but , it might not necessarily bad thing . if " liar poker " must read financial markets , " play money " should definitely counterpart virtual economies .	1
i thoroughly disappointed this book . it seemed so much promise ! main character completely unlikable- she made me never want get married ! she epitome woman who willing settle simply married . she seems view her fianc decent catch , but not something she madly love . addition , i strongly disliked author writing style . i can't put my finger it , but it just felt rough forced , like nothing flowed smoothly . choppy i suppose . perhaps this appeals some , but i found it hard read . someone stated earlier review , i also can't stop reading middle book or i would stopped . it bad . read your own risk .	-1
this book excellent introduction " big " history modern-day afghanistan , providing overview empire building collapsing ( either afghans pushing outward or others pushing inwards ) , succeeding waves tribes armies moving through region , etc . anyone interested understanding afghanistan some historical depth it , this book one i would , consequently , recommend . where author falls flat , my opinion , when he begins pontificate how united states should pursued its intervention nation . this instance he betrays minimal level understanding ( " where light parts 1st infantry division ? " question he asks , apparently unaware current answer such don't exist , instance ) . book redeem itself bit looking future afghanistan , author proposing rather novel notion modelling afghan government switzerland . author makes decent case idea , even if it might sound bit odd .	-1

i very much looked forward receiving this book through mail , due tons praise which people expressed it . i am however very disappointed . i only read first few pages ( including first one which quotes multitude praise ) emphasis summary/chronology south african history . i am south african , i find it littered inaccuracies which should not present history book . it painfully obvious book written foreigner . examples : boer war becomes " war whites " . i would liked see rand revolt mentioned name . botha becomes prime minister . botha who ? pik ? pw ? newcomer sa history should not guess such things . 1981-1988 south african forces invade angola . uh .... no . sa started incursions into angola 1976 . since this history sa , i point out quick scan book reveals no more detail around these events , yet he takes cheap shot afrikaner government making it sound though they willy-nilly went into angola sake oppressing people . it seems author opted avoid explaining historical facts behind these very important events . what reader not know , fidel castro through this period time circulated 350 000 ( if i remember correctly ) cuban soldiers through angola infiltrate southern africa communism , through war sponsored soviet money state-of-the-art military equipment training . south africans responding this threat avoid spread communism into region ( it rumored cia condoned this until withdrawal vietnam ) . simultaneously civil wars other southern african countries tied this , well soviet military training anc members such thabo mbeki others . events surrounding incursions into angola tremendous complexities tied into it direct cause effect role interaction government , apartheid era crackdowns , african political organizations . author not discuss these influential details modern history book scandal . he chooses refer province we officially call kwazulu-natal , kwazulu . overall first few pages not bode well rest book , but i report back when i'm reading i t.t his report-back : after reading book i realized my initial harsh criticism borne expectation purchased detailed history book . after realizing it not , i eased my expectations somewhat despite errors . overall book readable but superficial summary south african history , anyone who wants claim they balanced understanding south africa history cannot so without read further than this source . book clearly written audience ( perhaps freshman university level ) who need first-order introduction sa history . this sense book fairly well written but omissions essential events several factual errors prompt me rate it 3.5 stars . i rate it 2 stars however , because this book marketed authoritative book sa history , praise desmond tutu title book misleadingly suggests . it nothing kind ( least i hope it not best there !!!!! ) . i think praise this book received outdated inappropriate today day age title should read " summary sa history " . since author seems update book time goes , adding chapters , he cannot excused not filling gaps , correcting errors previous chapters , adding details . book therefore seems propagate gaps recorded sa history instead aspiring become accurate detailed authoritative reference time goes . it pity . one more comment : least one reviewer advised take last chapter grain salt since it appears too pessimistic him . i couldn't disagree more ! last chapter - apart few opinionated ( would subtle foreigners)statements author terms seemingly continuing make africans underdogs caucasians antagonists - factual , accurate ( perhaps even understated ) recording dismal deterioration sa society incompetence government played out 94-2000 . continuing trend these events clearly seen everyday south african news up this day .	-1

i not think subtitle " complete guide most popular cisco firewall security features " goes level credit this book truly goes too . david hucaby not only write guide , he wrote book clearly sit my quick grab shelf right next my desk years come ( or until next version ) . introduction states " book meant used tool every day activities .

first time i became acquainted wally lamb , i read " she come undone " english lit course . like many other i adored book , but hesitant when i picked up " i know this much true " two reasons . first , it seems like nowadays truly incredible books hard find . so what chances finding two same writer ? secondly , sheer length book ( just under 1000 pages ) little intimidating first glance . given my previous experiences lengthy modern novels , i ready big let down once again . yet , i pleasantly surprised find one best books i've read , ever . wally lamb such great job when tackling seemingly controversial topics most writers wouldn't dream touching . worked kids suffering behavioral/mental disorders i impressed his potrayal not only effect schizophrenia individual , but also effect people surrounded individual . granted he adds your occasional plot twist add " story " ( twins , flashbacks , ex-wives ) he still manages hit nail head . both dominick thomas so well rounded you feel angst pain every treacherous turn battle both fight against thomas disease . novel evokes every human emotion possible end you may find yourself smiling ( or frowning ) through tears . i know i love book make this happen i recommend it anyone who looking something absolutely incredible . even better yet , despite length book i couldn't put it down . far it one easiest 900 page reads i've ever picked up . my only complaint , book come end .	1
arguably robert heinlein best work , starship troopers classic piece science fiction displaying earth future galactic war against sentinel race giant bugs set destroying humankind . story told through eyes juan rico , member mobile infantry . rico explains how he joined mi , some his adventures , how he rose through ranks . starship troopers actually more book philosophy military thought set against backdrop society which only people who vote those who served military ( makes one think term " citizen soldiers " completely different ) . far action story , starship troopers doesn't much offer . much book given dialogues explaining philosophy book promotes . also , many action scenes more concerned military strategy than describing action . however , i found most meaningful works sci fi those deal deep philosophical issues or social ills . starship troopers isn't everyone . however , it piece classic sci-fi worth reading if you don't mind not read lot action sequences	1

there irrestible desire compare this 800 plus page novel russia stalingrad leo tolstoy much longer novel russia napoleon moscow 1811 , some respects they alike . both superb . both express russian love homeland . both extol russian defeat invader . both bring russia past up close . but there dirrerences - substantial diffeences . tolstoy portrait painter words writing two generations after fact . grossman there time he damn good - photographer words . tolstoy romantic ; grossman unblinking realist there nothing " sweet " what he tells you , upside down orwellian morality stalinist state , where evil good , where good rewarded evil , where bad things happen again again good people no reason other than fact they somehow innocently run afoul some small deail machinery party . example there colonel pyotr novitov who exemplary officer commanding tank corps stalingrad encirclement . he through retreat across russia 1941 now , staffed again fine division , he move regain caucasus ; he love yvengenia shapsonikov who formerly married nikolay krymov commissarin red army . she given him every reason believe she loves him too come him field . but krymov , who served party faithfully without stint over years , set up , horribly beaten nkvd lubyanka pison moscow , forced confess politcal crime sentemced labor camp . yvengenia stands novikov up goes back krymov . then novikov suspended his command instance commissar his division ( politican named getmanov ) because he paused rest his men ten hours after advancing battle without pause everal days ( getmanov wanted division first into caucasus ) recalled moscow political punishment krymov type . i cite this example - one many similiar stories - typify tone this book - unremitting , steady black gloom . nothing good happens anybody - ever . sons killed , mothers sent gas chamber , families riven distance over whole deadful scene , hovering like deadly miasma death , stalinist state , cruel , dishonest , cynical fundamentally personification evil , just bad nazis - maybe worse because it purported represent common man . so should you read this book ? absolutely . while it would help understand how spelling russian names apparently changes gender while you ned chart characters better than one back book ( i finally made one my use ) while you really need some knowledge russian history post 1916 - revolution , collectivization , famine , purge 1937 etc . - you go it alone see how morally obscene communism really - particularly under stalin . you need . this angry book written without sunlight angry man writing death evil stalinist state cold gray dead winter 1943 stalingrad . tolstoy leaves you thinking mozrt , grossman writes dirge - but he good . very very good . read it compare	1

this fascinating , original take what lies ahead . rather than project single future , authors joel . barker scott . erickson examine existing trends group them into five regions technology . they explain each technology , extrapolate future it might create if it alone shaped world , then discuss how these different technological currents might intersect . barker erickson paint their five futures broad swaths . this allows them cover lot ground sketch many potential markets challenges , but it also means they cover their ground shallowly . five technologies they examine , they far more solidly grounded " super tech , " " limits tech " " nature tech " than " local tech " or " human tech . " they sometimes treat individual place them categories their fans might dispute . example , science fiction author isaac asimov long-time supporter population control limiting power machines , but he found here super tech rather than limits tech . these small nuances should not take away your enjoyment this book , which we recommend managers who want plan flexible , productive future , those who enjoy mental experiments challenges , since , times , it simply fun read	1

political memoirs usually disappointing . they're self-serving , self-aggrandizing ( i met blah , then i met blah2 , my wife loved his wife , blah blah blah ) , humorless pretentious . most all , they're boring . after all , constant name-dropping , self-justification glossing over any failures gets dull after , say , 20 pages . senator ( possible vice president ) john edwards ' book refreshing oasis among political memoir desert . one , it more focused than usual political memoir . sen. edwards before he senator already renowned fearsome trial lawyer . this book focuses mainly four trials sen. edwards won his 20-year career . john edwards likes consider himself warrior " little guy . " his first trial he highlights his book settlement he won alcoholic who given huge dose antabuse left completely debilitated neurotoxic drug . i couldn't help but admire edwards , who when he took this case rather inexperienced . many trial lawyers not take cases former alcoholics , they don't exactly make most sympathetic plaintiffs . but fact edwards refused settle fought this crippled alcoholic imo shows compassion . johh edwards this book comes across quite differently his television persona , which unfailingly sunny , even sweet . here he sounds fiercely determined . i thought if i corporate lawyer i wouldnt want mess edwards . particular he describes outsmarting " other side " courtroom -- he seems particularly fond letting unsympathetic witnesses dig their own graves . he describes personal tragedies ( like death his son wade ) there palpable anger towards irresponsible doctors companies . his book occasionally maudlin -- his descriptions his wife kids , example . book written mostly flat , inoffensive prose so prevalent these kinds memoirs . john edwards too young war hero ( la john mccain ) , but despite lack overt heroics i came away sense admiration john edwards , his fairness determination	1

this book certainly moments great insight . emerson passion quite clear often well-articulated . but this very lengthy book , many essays no longer much offer they perhaps once . there several invaluable , course , but many them simply become too obtuse arcane really relevant anymore . i read book all way through , but my recommendation would people purchase it simply reference , maybe read more famous essays now again . end , many essays disturbing undercurrents racism or anti-democratic sentiment emerson inability see nature dark force , it sometimes , sinks large portions book . we must bear mind emerson writing different time his comments now unacceptable not always way . clearly this book historically important , it obviously worthwhile one sitting shelf quote or occasionally reference , but it certainly not bulletproof guide living many made it out	-1
let freedom ring , sean hannity sends out subliminal message he his writing truth , justice , american way . just title represents everything true good him america . his five-star reviewers his message reinforces their pre-conceived beliefs hannity words validation those beliefs . if this written ghost writer , he should withheld payment . if it wasn't written ghostwriter , hannity should one his next attempt literary hyperbole . first chapter written maudlin , " those-were-the-good-old-days " wistfulness his immigrant grandfather who he describes honest man integrity , believer american dream . but before you say " erin go braugh " he talking courage george . bush standing up terrorism . exactly how g.w. , he doesn't elaborate . how he goes grandfather dubbya bit magic . hannity next trick impugn clinton gore soft terrorism . his source this , all people , dick morris who knew clintons now works fox republican advocacy network . he quotes morris who makes such vague statements " it seemed they afraid talking terrorism , " or " they seemed indifferent terrorism . " these " morris mind-reads " conjectural , but hannity uses them , which he impunity . let take closer look hannity unimpeachable source moment . it dick morris who quit clintons shortly after second election . it morris who penchant streetwalkers , some jail time , entered alcohol rehab . you'd think sh could find better source if he expects freedom ring ! but , hannity doesn't skip beat . he points out how democrats such senators kerry daschle voted against certain defense-spending bills . what he neglects inform his readers reasons they because riders attached bills , or number republicans who also voted against same bills , or many defense bills kerry daschle vote . he never once advises his reader defense spending programs killed dick cheney when he secretary defense . such deception called propaganda . propaganda something hannity no compunction using here . this he continuing tell tale long since debunked . namely , it story president clinton offered osama bin laden sudanese government . again , it what he doesn't say misdirects reader . sudan made offer hope economic sanctions against them slave-trading , lifted . however , fbi determined sudanese playing us because they neither ability nor intent handing over bin laden . sudanese also made offer saudi arabia , but saudis revoked bin laden citizenship , refused take him . benjamin franklin said " statistics liar . " hannity uses charts same purpose . he shows how under reagan , army bought over 500 tanks . under clinton , army bought none . this leads one assumption clinton nothing services . he doesn't mention army buys tanks , not presidents . he doesn't mention army all tanks they needed armored warfare against soviet union never came . he doesn't mention army began changing its warfare strategies which would include more transportable fighting vehicles . grateful hannity cannot rewrite famous works literature he attempts history . if he could , instead seeing dead captain ahab killed whale " moby dick , " we might just see grinning captain standing next tethered whale caption : " i caught fish this big ! " there something very fishy his facts , his historical parallels which aren't parallel , what he chooses tell you , what he chooses leave out . this book , he tells whale-sized whoppers !	-1

good dream interpreter offer multiple possibilities which you might pick . one make sense you surpass " reasonable " or " plausible " attain " feeling right . " similar sense , i enjoy franzen essays most when they elicit instant affirmation . those moments , you nod , say he hit upon something , notice what nifty way he found express what you should known before . surprisingly , he seldom achieves exalted state when he speaking personally , himself . he seems more effective when he triangulates his own views contributions other smart people . reading this collection essays , you occasionally detect prickliness makes him -- rightly or wrongly -- literary bad boy . his indignation veer into stridency . however , you also see sort warmth , me , corrections sometimes lacked . franzen suggests his essay " why bother ?, " i read confirmation life complicated . its best , how alone so way suggests not just solidarity franzen -- those he quotes -- but what franzen observes	-1

i over 30 years experience strategic thinking consultant planner . i constantly find people totally different concepts what strategy all . each tends either too focused one area , or incomplete some aspects . result , people logically arrive some pretty bad strategic conclusions . typically , this involves strategy organization cannot execute well or which competitors quickly negate . what i like this simple book it nicely summarizes case balanced perspective customer , competitor your own company . although most american companies believe they this , american approach much more superficial incomplete than japanese one . example , if japanese company wants add new product , evaluation looks heavily how well customer able use product how effectively company able provide it context probable competitive offerings . american analysis feature financial analysis forecast often based little more than spreadsheet doodling . weakness japanese model they typically look too little business environment ( notice how often they buy american businesses properties top market inflated prices ) , relatively insensitive financial implications . fast moving technology markets , japanese consensus-building process also tends slow down time market . clearly , there no perfect model strategic thinking fits all situations . major weakness many efforts assume future precisely forecast . patently wrong . typically , relative importance elements considered needs adjusted fit circumstnace . seems art rather than science this point . although this book its limitations ( suggested above ) , it valuable perspective strategy thinking helpful most american business people if they think concepts more thorough way . balance perspective here , i suggest you also read profit patterns get sense how circumstances play role profitability . good thinking ! may this book help you overcome any stalled thinking you not doing your home work thinking outperforming competitors provide benefits matter lot customers .	1

i just wanted add my own $0.02 already great reviews this book gotten . if you're like me , you'll hard time learning other methods primarily use sound/sight recognition memorization ( like rosetta stone ) . this book , however , takes very common sense ( logical , my opinion ) approach learning russian . example , it not show you verb conjugation just expect you memorize it ( like most russian books/materials seem ) - its approach , instead , first show you how conjugate variety verbs . armed this knowledge , you then step into useful examples . others recommended here , i also recommend finding course or tutor attend addition learning this book . i took cheap ($100 ) non-credit class semester local university ... it wonders - minimum - native speaker communicate . book great job sounding out difficult pronounciations , but it only go so far while native speaker could correct you spot minimal effort . sure , this book available online here $12 , but don't underestimate value learning language interactive environment ( don't even begin think such minimal investment all you need )	1

mcknight concerns communities ' dependency professional assistance legitimate , but disturbingly overstated this book . end i felt mcknight trashing already well-trodden government provision social services may not altogether helpful distressed communities . he sidesteps concerns capital mobility exploitation pernicious effects wrought years discrimination . any debate over when where how social programs effective cast aside well , since mcknight picture , social programs professional service providers , fact , vilains culprits most what ails society . one damaging fallacies seems perpetuated this book service professionals not able both professional caring - two deemed mutually incompatible . mcknights views resonate employers ' caring rhetoric - conveniently invoked every time healthcare worker tries claim she care patients but still entitled living wage or , perhaps , health insurance . what further implied communities readily ably take up reign providing themselves their members when denied more institutionalized professional services . it seems implied communities no problems before social programs solve them came into . this , i think i see mcknight invokeing idealized notion society earlier time ; maybe his argument would seemed more reasoble time when families less geographically mobile may constituted economic unit , when elderly lived shorter lives less numerous themselves more children care them , local economic activities more functionally interdependent . but mcknight model today cure doesn't seem fit today conditions . other hand , mcknights solutions may only ones available society where budget cuts elimination social services seem prevailing trend .	-1

before i even opened book start reading it , i already coming it filled particular expectations . i actually think we often/always approach books , among other things , this manner . this case , though , i fortunate enough aware what those expectations beginning . particular , given valerio past associations this bridge called my back this bridge we call home , i looking forward race feminism figured more centrally testosterone files than other ftm texts ( memoir otherwise ) . while no means i exhausted entire genre , i'd say my readings thus far , i've hard-pressed find ftm text leaves me feeling satisfied its treatment race . so , admittedly , testosterone files lot live up ... perhaps too much . frankly , i'm torn ... i'm definitely glad read book , well own it . i proudly display it my bookshelf ( where self space high premium ) . trans text , i think its focus testosterone ( opposed surgery ) helps stretch boundaries genre , how we think trans itself . like other ftm texts , there much focus body its physical transformations , but because emphasis isn't surgery it offers something those readers who either want transition without surgery , or simply transition live without surgery due other constraints ( e.g. , affordability , or lack thereof ) . even though valerio makes clear text he experienced discomfort his breasts , it because lack able afford top surgery he hadn't surgery ( well , until he wrote this book ! ) , need surgery becomes undertone text -- ever present but not overwhelmingly so . instead , what dominates talk testosterone . " hormones really work . " it realization valerio seems taken aback . he writes , " hormones ... i'd read testosterone its dramatic effects his [ lou sullivan ] booklet , but i never my wildest dreams imagined it could this good . this transformation miracle " ( 103 ) . like other similar texts , valerio describes changes his physical body undergoes he begins inject testosterone -- disappearance his extra fat , coarsening texture his hair , changes his skin . interestingly , valerio also describes changes his bodily emotions undergo effects testosterone . i say bodily emotions here because valerio makes clear it not just emotions disconnected his body , but precisely way which his body , because its changing chemistry , processes emotions differently than it once , ultimately resulting different physical manifestations those emotions . specifically , he finds testosterone limited his ability physically cry he once , instead increased his aggressiveness . when i first encountered these testimonials his how women biologically predisposed cry men fight , something me tightened . my initial reaction get defensive wonder how text i thought would so feminist could so blatantly reinforce traditional gender stereotypes . then i remembered there grains truth most stereotypes , what important not overcompensate trying make argument not all women cry drop hat , or men cry , but rather respect honor valerio experiences . this way , testosterone files , invaluable me challenging my understanding myself feminist , gently helping me grow further into kind feminism inspired me beginning -- one not only prized difference , but saw our power coming those very differences ( thanks audre lorde ! ) . i said earlier , however , despite ways which testosterone files added my knowledge understanding man transformation , i disappointed race wasn't more central issue throughout text . there moments when valerio writes his native heritage , his mother reserve , passing white some times , latino others , but these but moments , conversations race don't seem sustained throughout . end , i feel like book valerio wanted write testosterone above all else . respects , he succeeded . book i wanted valerio written negotiating racial feminist consciousness politics context ftm transition . i recognize my disappointments testosterone files not valerio failings , but rather signs my own longings .	-1

dr. thomas sowell book , " conflict visions " attempt explore primary , if unarticulated , philosophy historical conservatism liberalism . his thesis conservatism tradition operating vision humans sees them ' constrained . ' some characteristics this view :( 1 ) humans generally selfish natures . ( 2 ) human reason , while valuable , quite limited . ( 3 ) because this , society grows evolution , not central deliberate planning . ( 4 ) social decisions generally involve not ' solutions ' but ' trade-offs ' ( how much good how much downside ? )(5 ) procedural fairness , rather than results-based fairness , key just society . conversely , sowell writes liberal tradition operates vision humankind ' unconstrained . ' features include : ( 1)human selfishness quality overcome reason education . ( 2 ) human reason , when used properly , trump human impulses , emotions , feelings . ( 3)the planned society best . non-planned societies = chaos . ( 4 ) while policy trade-offs might good short term solution , reason discover true solutions equitable all . ( 5)procedural fairness not fair so long disperate outcomes result . sowell backs up his thesis impressive research , citations , quotes . this refreshing becuase it makes sure he not simply creating strawmen . conservative side , his quites tend come edmunde burke , adam smith , freidrich hayek , oliver wendell holmes . liberal side , his quotes tend come william godwin , marquis de condorcet , jean jacques rousseau , ronald dworkin . ( one who read all these authors , i assure readers there no strawmen here . ) only murky part book sowell makes this vision sound too simplistic . while he acknowledges not all thinkers fall into either one or other category ( even chapter marx mill - two thinkers borrow both sides ) , some his choices people quotes exempify each ' side ' less clean-cut than one might like . libertarian , it strange me see edmunde burke ( who valued tradition more than most anything ) friedrich hayek ( who valued innovation capitalism more than anything ) same group . ( holmes not necessarily best jurist exemplify ' strict construction ' contitution ) . [ it would interesting see , then , appendix ideological divorce libertarianism conservatism . ] other ' side , ' i kept thinking , although william godwin might good example someone who believed reason virtually omnipotent , he also liability sowell case , godwin not believe planned society whatever fact , anarchist who against planning any form ! while examples aren't perfect , sowell didn't intend them . all all , it good book i think sowell argument good one , most part , true . some other books similar vain - exploring ideological divide sides - try george lakoff " moral politics " e.j. dionne " why americans hate politics .

davidson trying solve age-old problem " unity proposition " . proposition socrates hits plato different heap socrates , relation hitting , plato . this corresponds semantic fact " socrates hits plato " sentence , whereas " socrates , relation hitting , plato " not . frege ineffectively tried solve this saying verb ( " socrates hits plato " ) denotes something which " unsaturated " , i.e. holes it , thereby enabling thing link up , proposition-forming way , items flanking it . frege theory radically confused , davidson noted many times . ( one thing , it absurd result thing corresponding verb " hits " hole it , whereas thing corresonding noun " relation hitting " not . but how this , given both expressions presumably pick out same relation ? frege gave absurd answer we cannot speak properties way we speak individuals -- this embodied frege dictum " property horse not property " . ) rightly rejecting frege view , davidson produces one his own , which -- like much his previous work -- involves dubious reliance tarski work relating definability truth-predicates formal languages . throughout his career , davidson often tried turn tarski technical points logic deep semantic metaphysical account . davidson also seems found support tarski work some extremely strange , i believe , false doctrines . tarski disquotationalism -- " snow white " true iff snow white -- apparently inspired davidson think ( ) there no propositions ( sentences enough ) , ( ) there no facts , ( ) predicate " true " corresponding property innocuous somehow vacant ( this supposedly evidenced apparent equivalence " snow white " " it true snow white " ) ( ) there no difference meanings truth-conditions ( tarski talks truth-conditions , not meanings ) . none these doctrines any real support tarski work ; davidson attempt give them support - particular , his use spurious " slingshot " argument prove there no facts , consequently , sentences not made true anything -- involved rather glaring fallacies . davidson views truth based complete failure see past phonetic surface structure indicative sentences . purely orthographic point view , " snow white " less complex than corresponding nominal : " snow white " . but semantically story very different . both encode proposition snow white . but " snow white " something additional : it manages ascribe truth proposition . ( how this delicate matter . ) once semantic anatomy " snow white " laid bare , it becomes impossible sustain idea truth-predicate innocuous or concomitant idea nothing makes sentence true . davidson views these matters projections folk-syntax , source annoyance anyone who ( unlike davidson ) gives any credence work chomsky other depth-grammarians . identity predication , unique blend obscurity , indirectness , flabby logic vitiated much davidson earlier work full bloom . further , he doesn't really add anything wasn't already found his earlier papers . philosopher , davidson some fine moments . his work scepticism original ( though unsuccessful ) . some aspects his work semantics -- especially his excavation logical form action sentences his scathing criticisms ( " theories learnable languages " ) frege bizarre views indirect discourse -- philosophical classics . but this work , davidson not his best , this exposes certain lack focus pervaded his career . scale 1 10 , i give it 2	-1

firstly , yes , if you're bound determined ride republican train into ground , or if you're afraid potty words , don't read this book . it could say stuff you don't like . most folks i know real tired sort holier-than-thou posturing . other hand , i felt like i reading book one my friends written . narcissism gets little grating , but that what we're like . that nature 30s 40s crowd . swearing ... well , again , i don't know too many people who don't talk way . but general sense loss purpose , grandiose plans gone hell , plain old existential angst far too familiar . one day we all realize if you look like marketing guy , work marketing guy , aren't actively writing , painting , acting , inventing , crafting , whatever -- guess what ? you're marketing guy . more practical level , it one those books , julie herself describes , demonstrates all possibilities out there see world larger than one you'd settled into . it kind book makes you think ' huh , wonder what i could dive into ?

like many groundbreaking works , this one must seen important when it written what it said then , important now what it led . inspired , without doubt , monumental drucker study ibm , it took case analysis step further . its seminal ideas found many contemporary studies schools or management thinking which taken these principles yet further . doesn't mean it should no longer read . but , after reading it , get most reading it , other contemporary works should included your reading list . example , jim collins ' " built last " " good great " , john roberts ' " modern firm " take peters watermans ' original insights many steps further .

what more said which already hasn't this extraordinary book written extraordinary man courage ? 900+ reviews , i not make this overly elaborate review , book simply not require it . elie wiesel story one one man courage , fortitude push when all around him lost ; friends , family , belongings , even basic human dignity . what struck me more than anything else his personal story retelling hanging three men ( well , two men one boy ) while he one concentration camps . millions perished , but way boy who suffered during hanging stayed me . his story story millions who perished who never got tell their tale , one few books i would call must read . different instances book i am quite sure strike readers differently . one things which struck me stayed me how he kept looking god , even amidst enormity man sometimes carry out his fellow man . what also struck me woman train who saw flames camps even before they arrived . times he scolded questioned himself his ethics even thinking selfish thoughts even though he dying . i still think would i ( could i ? ) same if i his terrible position ? this book shows worst mankind , sadly this terrible event known holocaust not entirely unique man history since freeing elie wiesel . we witnessed rwanda firsthand 1990 , told world authorities " this never happen again . " yet modern day sudan(and north korea , tibet ..... ) , we see much same ..... world turning its back millions people . there may not furnaces involved , but crime complicity through inaction little different than world which allowed human beings fed into furnaces . i guess final question i come away asking his book " mankind ever learn ?

i loved anthony swofford gulf war memoir , jarhead , but no disrespect its author or kirkus reviews which calls it " israeli jarhead " , company offers far richer reading experience . american-born watzman served almost 20 years israeli military , starting regular army 1982 , moving reserves ' 84 . this period covers broad swath modern israeli history , watzman brilliantly demnstrates how he able ( overcoming personal conflicts ) mix his political views -- anti-settlements -- his soldierly duties , which often required defending settlers unapologetically executing missions which he opposed principle . his company contained people across full spectrum israeli politics ( die-hard expansionists socialistic peaceniks religious zealots ) . watzman showed exceptional dedication doggedly reporting duty year after year into middle age , leaving his work wife 4 kids every year report front-line duty , when so many his peers easily managing escape reservist service . even after illness left him permanently disabled almost crippled he'd passed his 40th birthday ( ancient footsoldier ) , watzman insisted doing battle his adopted country . he true hero patriot wonderfully entertaining writer .	1

we know some things saul tarsus ( later named apostle paul ) but complete biography always lacking because sketchy incomplete information . most everything we know paul dr. luke book acts or paul epistles themselves . ii peter chapter 3 makes some very intriguing statements . peter , some his last earthly words before martyrdom , validates paul apostleship states some his writings teachings difficult but we should follow them . pollock book presented documentary-style reading since paul complete biography not entirely clear . there much author states inference or speculation . if you respect not build doctrine facts where evidence fuzzy , i think this excellent book . one example " fuzzy " facts pollock considers age-old controversy over authorship book hebrews . author hebrews not identify himself scholars argue who wrote it . pollock speculates paul , while imprisioned acts ch . 24 two years may time motivation write book people he so desparately wanted reach . his imprisonment his controversial style among jews , he may left his identity anonymous so he himself would not stumbling block reach his jewish brothers . eternity reveal who wrote book hebrews but it certainly plausible theory . overall , greatest benefit reading this book provide better framework understanding paul he travels among early churches wrote letters them correcting various false teachings problems developed .	1

this deeply flawed book . it purports description characteristics attitudes make wealthy people wealthy , but it based mostly their self-assessments without comparison control group . i suspect this heavily underplays role random chance success , attributes causation where there only correlation . further , author displays clear biases number topics , which leads him engage ad hoc interpretation his data , sometimes argue conclusions contrary clear implications data -- such his arguments importance religion lives millionaires . pp . 33-35 , author looks success factors , compares role luck pp . 82-85 , which he downplays favor discipline . while he touches importance right connections ( genetic contributions intelligence ) , . 85 he asks " what luck graduating medical school ? what luck successfully running medical practice ? very little , according these physicians . " but what luck born into family country where one chance reach adulthood , let alone able attend medical school ? quite bit . unlike its predecessor , which looked prodigious accumulators wealth ( paws ) vs . under-accumulators wealth ( uaws ) , this book focuses millionaires ( paws ) decamillionaires ( tiny subset paws , those net worth $10m or greater ) . lack comparison general public serves limit book value . misleading comparison businessmen stockbrokers pp . 76ff makes point . stanley states former occupation more likely higher net worth . but this comparison misleading because he only looking millionaire-plus sample ; he excluding more total business owner population his sample than stockbrokers . average median income net worth business owners likely lower than stockbrokers . if he made same comparison actors or musicians stockbrokers , example , problem more obvious -- excluding all those who aren't worth $1m or more up front , you exclude vast majority , pull up average . stockbrokers , other hand , higher percentage them top income earners wealthy . . 110 , after pages importance ethics advising " never lie . never tell one lie . " ( . 55 ) , he passes right over his example , mr. warren , lying college graduate order get job , without comment , without noticing hypocrisy . pp . 173-174 , author wants make point prayer important millionaires dealing stress , despite fact majority his surveyed population not regularly pray . ( he repeats this again . 370 , saying " nearly one-half millionaires ( 47 percent ) engaged prayer . ... significant percentage millionaires , their religious faith major force their lives . " ) trying emphasize point ( . 174 ) , he splits his sample into " religious millionaires " ( rm ) " other millionaires " ( om ) , observes 75% rm engage prayer while only 8% om , points out this " ratio more than nine one . " this meaningless comparison , however -- rm make up only 37% his total population millionaires , so his " more than nine one " ratio really nothing more than saying , those millionaires who religious , three-fourths hold religious practices which involve regular prayer ( 8% those who not consider themselves religious pray anyway ) . since om population much larger than rm population , absolute numbers that not nine-t o-o ne ratio -- his numbers show 28% his total sample rm who pray , while 5% his total sample om who pray -- closer six-t o-o ne ratio . but more importantly , author glosses over fact not only majority millionaires not religious , even quarter those who don't engage regular prayer ! given u.s. one most religious countries world , fact such low percentage millionaires religious quite interesting worthy further exploration cause , but stanley , religion prayer important foundation " millionaire mind , " he completely misses opportunity find explanation why millionaires so much less religious than general population . later table book . 366 , he shows activities engaged sample 733 millionaires during preceding 30 days . table includes 52% attending religious services , 47% praying , 37% attending religious events , 22% bible/devotional reading . these numbers don't quite match up rm/om data pp . 173-174 , which seem show even lower levels religious activity , but these still lower than they nonmillionaire population -- weekly church attendance notoriously over-reported surveys . work mark chaves , . kirk hardaway , p.l. marler 1990s found actual percentage attendance half what surveys show . this actually could mean millionaires attend more often , if stanley survey results don't similar over-reporting . author religious bias further leads him recommend student going through divorce she , despite not church attendee , search mate joining church group ( . 268 ) because she " believed marriage traditional family concept . " he writes " i believe one likely find better prospects church setting than singles bars . course , there no guarantees , but people religious orientation more prone respect principles espoused good book . " but why he just guessing this ? hasn't he asked his population millionaires -- ones who 63% non-religious -- how they met their mates ? he this , very usefully , regarding how millionaires purchase their homes ( pp . 315-326) -- yet isn't picking partner even more important ? this book some interesting data , its best when giving comparative results populations ( e.g. , house-purchasing characteristics economically productive millionaires vs . non-economically productive millionaires chapter 7 ) . but it doesn't stand up well comparison millionaire next door , which much better book	-1

i loved earlier nevada barr mysteries , their depiction national parks natural dangers . i wasn't happy some her latest efforts , but still hadn't given up her . now i'm not so sure . this latest novel started off well enough although idea two severely traumatized girls should clue what would follow . idea they polygamous mormon sect red herring . perhaps it barr attempt show us how these girls abused even before they met evil incarnate . scenes where anna realizes who real villian her interaction him poor tortured third traumatized girl went over 60 pages . each scene more disturbing one before it . i found myself skimming pages still am not sure how she resolved all loose ends . but i absolutely no desire re-read end book find out . i wish i could say i would read nevada barr novel because i so thoroughly enjoyed first ones . but after reading this disturbing , somewhat convoluted story , i would think twice . if i pick up anna pigeon novel , i'd make sure i something else read if story took dark turn . i would certainly not stick it end .	-1

i wary buying tarot book online , though i finally make decision buy this book based reviews here compared reviews other tarot books . i've rather impressed this book . author chose , wisely , use gold-standard tarot , rider-waite deck her demonstrations detailed study tarot symbolism . rider-waite widely available both original well other variations ( i personally love universal waite deck ... same deck prettier colors ) . i've waited some time review , but decided now would good time any since i see this book i working through some time . i've given it once-through , using it reference since i bought it . this book emphasises learning study ( which takes years ) over quick-fix guides tarot which suggest one could effectively read tarot only minutes . it long process , one i've working over decade casually , one which i continue work years come , aided this very good reference . seventy-eight degrees wisdom also presents use tarot without excess new-age trappings , focusing cards their symbols themselves , not extraneous things , particular religious views , or other things which i've read scanning other tarot books . i think this book excellent intermediate students tarot , gives wonderful sense complexities tarot , while keeping it basics , focusing foundations learning rather than host many spreads use . may your journey learning fruitful .	1
i don't usually read christian fiction . not because i'm atheist or agnostic or any other " " word would make my southern baptist parents turn over their graves , but because i like my fiction quite bit more true-to-life than usually allowed unrealistic restrictions most christian publishers place upon their authors . so i thrilled find joe box -- john robinson rough-edged detective until last dog dies -- real ... well , joe himself might say , real slap upside head your mama when you're not paying attention . joe multi-dimensional character who takes you him just deftly when he revisits 30-year-old memories vietnam when you follow him breathlessly through investigation into who killing all his former platoon buddies . all joe lingering hard-nosed habits , ever-present steadily growing inner peace unmistakable contentment come joe still-new relationship god allows him face madman who wants destroy all joe loves . imperfect christians much better examples non-believers than any holier-than-thou pontificator nary flaw , bad habit , or tarnished spot his halo . joe box real christian who learning live his faith -- warts all . readers all kinds both like him identify him , i can't wait join him his next adventure	1

first farseer book impressed me its great writing interesting characters . second book , though not great , still solid sequel . this third farseer book mess ( see kaymin comments ) . 757 page book ( paperback version ) should edited fewer than 500 pages . few ill-considered , disjointed plot lines also should encountered delete key . what could not repaired some idiotic key elements such fact no one remembered ancient race who helped citizens buck actually dragons exist stone statues until imbued memories , souls , lives multiple humans . what heck ? somehow , protagonist , fitzchivalry , continues make same stupid mistakes he teenager still manages survive . main characters , only his wit-bonded wolf made reliably sensible decisions . given flaws described above , i am astonished many five star reviews this book . i believe fans first two books overly generous this one	-1

what would you if you could drink elixir removes all guilt your mind few hours allows you partake things you normally would never dream ? robert louis stevenson gives us glimpse what could happen " dr. jekyll mr. hyde . " it wonderful classic originally published 1886 . it , well-worn battle good evil played out not forms hero villain , but inside mind soul one man who toys idea acting out his most carnal ( least that what reader assumes ) longings . this isn't your cookie-cutter hollywood version " jekyll hyde . " it much deeper study human soul it longing bit " naughty " suffer none consequences . time again , jekyll drinks his " liquid courage " unleashes evil lies within . days , weeks months pass , jekyll finds it harder control beast within , his unholy friend makes more longer appearances . eventually , mr. hyde goes too far one his escapades , it drives jekyll brink sanity . way , we introduced characters such utterson his friend enfield . we also meet poole , dr. lanyon , brief appearance , maid servant who witnesses actions against one mr. carew . although jekyll hyde title characters , most book focus placed utterson . jekyll gets one chapter ( final one ) which give his account what happens him he undergoes his changes . most films plays based this book portray doctor good , wholesome man . however , while reading this book , i found he perhaps more evil than hyde . he capable controlling his desires . hyde not . instead prohibiting himself taking more elixir , jekyll openly enjoys it . he begins lose more more control his situation , he attempts correct his own wrongdoing . when this occurs , we find one thing hyde fears . this particular edition " jekyll hyde " features rather humdrum introductory essay vladimir nabokov . my opinion , he goes depths stevenson probably never meant uncovered his morality tale . skip introduction if you unfamiliar story . it nothing more than spoil your read . i recommend afterword dan chaon . it much more interesting , less depth look this brief , wonderful story . i highly recommend tale . it gets five stars , but introductory essay drags story down makes it almost boring . therefore , i give this version " dr. jekyll mr. hyde " four stars	-1

i always thought boundaries way keeping others safe distance out my personal business . instead , after reading this book , i learned boundaries also way connect others , allow greater closeness intimacy people our lives . order this , we need cultivate something author calls " boundary intelligence , " which intentional management three aspects boundaries : their permeability , flexibility , complexity . four elements boundary intelligence : awareness , insight , intention action . it makes sense -- if someone stepping all over us , or if we trespassing their boundaries , we need first all aware transgression , then insight realize we need adjust our boundary permeability . then we form intention change formulate plan action address boundary transgression . all us different boundary styles , interesting quiz chapter 3 helps us understand our inner boundaries ; those we others our lives ; how their complexity , flexibility , permeability all impact our dealings others . i found this very interesting helpful . book several other quizzes , but they lacked enough explanation me make real sense them . throughout book , numerous anecdotes examples tell boundaries trampled ignored , all which further illustrated necessity understanding learning how successfully negotiate boundaries people our lives . one area dealt something author termed " emotional trespass . " this when " we may not know exactly where our boundaries , but we know when they've violated . " i think innumerable examples this my own life , but i never way describe it before . armchair interviews says : boundary intelligence help you navigate your way through all relationships your life .	-1

" tone -- usually it " shucks , it seemed like great idea time " grin instead . that really what makes book -- lighthearted , if not always lightweight , look her travels through music biz . trynin knack description , giving you just enough place you right there setting without overdoing it or stalling narrative . her recounting particularly awful radio interview highlight book , just flat-out funny ; conversely , section describing life home during respite touring , noting how difficult it her reconnect people her life , particularly enlightening thought-provoking . my only suggestion potential reader , then , if you've never heard her music before , finish book before you go hunting her cds . i picked one up ( " cockamamie , " main one written book ) , it bloody agony listen . i wouldn't enjoyed book nearly much i heard her music beforehand ; i mean , it almost wretched pixies , but i digress . so , sum up : fun book , so-so musician , i hope she book ( but no more songs ) her . like many reviewers here , i also read " so you want rock roll star , " while i agree it more dramatic tale , i'd say they're both rather well written would easily recommend either one	-1

lo que en el lejano 1997 comenz� siendo un entretenimiento , un osado intento de que los ni�os adolescentes espa�oles se aficionaran la lectura conocieran un poco de esa historia que hab�a desaparecido de los libros de texto , se ha convertido , al cabo del tiempo , en la mejor serie de novela hist�rica en castellano desde los episodios nacionales de galdos , en el plano internacional , el mas vivido �pico retrato de una �poca desde la trilog�a de los mosqueteros de alexandre dumas . igual que , despu�s de dumas , ya no fuimos capaces de ver al cardenal richelieu sino como al maquiav�lico villano en la sombra , tras p�rez reverte al gran quevedo no lo podremos imaginar sin la espada desenvainada el " no queda sino batirse " . en eso consiste el genio de la novela hist�rica : en ser veraz , ser puntilloso en descripciones lenguaje adem�s dar vida esos datos fr�os que llenan las biograf�as en las enciclopedias . dar vida los personajes hist�ricos no consiste en coger un fara�n , un emperador romano o lo que sea ponerlo descifrar enigmas polic�acos . consiste en tomar personajes reales , con sus virtudes defectos , hacerlos actuar seg�n las propias reglas de su tiempo su car�cter . el gran arturo , tras mostrarnos en las otras novelas de la saga las mazmorras de la inquisici�n , las trincheras de flandes el puerto de sevilla , nos lleva esta vez al teatro . teatro con may�sculas porque nunca antes desde luego nunca despu�s , conocer�a la historia tal concentraci�n de genios dedicados escribir para un publico que convert�a cada estreno en un acontecimiento social . ah� estaba el capit�n alatriste , code�ndose con los poetas , encam�ndose con las actrices como no , salvando el pescuezo al mism�simo rey de las espa�as . vuelven el cruel villano malatesta angelica de alquezar , ese bollicao mezcla de lolita femme fatale . como no , all� esta tambi�n i�igo de balboa para contarnos como ocurri� todo . finalmente , como es habitual en perez reverte no faltan los " cameos " de algunos personajes actuales que el lector espa�ol ( no as� los ajenos la realidad espa�ola ) no tardara en reconocer . en cuanto al titulo , aquellos que no sigan la trayectoria de p-r posiblemente no adviertan el gui�o sentimental que esconde . " el caballero del jub�n amarillo " es , seg�n dice p-r en el prologo de su primera novela " el husar " , el titulo de un follet�n que el propio padre de arturo perez reverte escribi� hace tiempo , cuando el folletin era ya un genero muerto muchos cre�an que enterrado . posiblemente el padre de p-r nunca imagino que su propio hijo desenterrar�a el genero lo elevar�a cumbres no antes holladas . en resumen : un nuevo acierto del mejor escritor espa�ol vivo .	1

this book ecumenical sermon global implications hyper-consumerism . it contains little information specific ways reduce consumption , leaving it open readers discover techniques work them . instead , it focuses ethical philosophy consuming only what you need . but foundations this philosophy firm ? author seems use guilt motivating factor getting westerners cut their consumption . he repeatedly states individuals west should reduce their consumption habits , suggesting implicitly high consumption west depriving developing world money or other resources . paradoxically , reducing consumption west would deny wages third world workers who produce consumer products western markets . so reducing western consumption means make world better place implies very simplistic view economics . besides , western hyper-consumerism pales face displayed affluent easterners or south asians . more defensible reason reducing consumption would because it simply makes you feel better personal level . also , it beneficial family budgets when money isn't spent before it earned . leads healthier family relationships . book focused its arguments such issues would far more convincing than this one .	-1

good part this book deals experiments conducted old school hypnosis . remember nancy school dr. liebeault your studies history hypnosis ? well , ormond mcgill brought them back life , so you'll get little bit more insight interesting experiments they used while hypnosis still used techniques mesmerism . i'm really glad all effort mcgill invested bringing back some valuable information enrich " modern " hypnotists - bringing life energy world hypnosis , because some intellectually oriented minds completely dropped energy out equasion due their own lack understanding . now , awareness using one mind work energy happily emerging west one may even thank proliferation eastern techniques methods ( india china - mainly area healing - sure , you've heard " chi kung " ) . west , these techings mainly wrapped mysteries reserved only those who inclination esoteric studies different occult practices . there two other books i recommend supplementary reading workbooks together this one - they ormond mcgill " hypnotism mysticism india " franz bardon " initiation into hermetics " . they help you better develop skills use techniques this book . after describing different experiments performed century or two ago ( matter , you find many other more modern books numerous other mind-over-matter experiments ) , ormond guides you through some practical techniques so you conduct your own experiments these techniques . book directed those who interest using them stage shows perspective , stage mentalists who only learn how use " tricks " make audience believe they something they not doing , benefit learning how able genuine mentalism instead faking using art deception . this account there some authors who entirely focused area deception because all they know all they aware , they live convinced everything comes even close it must some kind deception . but where here smoke , you rest assured there fire , too . even though they ignorant fire way how produce real effects , it doesn't mean real thing cannot . respect , i recommend this book all those " stage mentalists " who so far acquainted themselves only techniques producing different mind effects through trickery . they may surprise themselves what they able accomplish . this book also benefit regular hypnotherapist who no intention get involved any stage performance . they learn how add more power their hypnotic techniques , using power their minds , working energy direct thought transference , instead just using words . they may also become aware fact their own beliefs expectations , even though unvoiced affect outcomes they get their clients because there always silent communication going mental level it goes beyond subtle cues body language ( minimal cues , they called nlp ) . book called mindreading , but techniques covered also used what we call " remote hypnosis " or " remote influence " . it doesn't matter whether person sitting next you , or room , or even country - when you work mind energy . distinction made book contact non-contact mind-reading . contact mind-reading also used dr. milton erickson . here practice some essential nlp skills may helpful order good this , you'll aware subtle ( minimal cues ) given off person . it somewhat like " lie detector " , except instead machine , you using your own observational ( calibration ) skills notice subtle physiological differences person - this case through touch . non-contact mind-reading involves clearing your mind receiving mental impressions - something alike doing remote viewing , though there remote viewing techniques may go little bit further than this . those interested incorporating mindreading techniques this book their stage show , ormond mcgill provides several different routines spice up show .	1

this very important book , seeing it gives us access lives ideas normal americans , how racial dimension affects them . book includes 17 interviews various persons , including families couples . author edited himself out it , so it more like 17 monographs than 17 interviews . although not much new under sun me , book should read every fully european descended person america , show them they not alone their thoughts . recent poll i read time magazine ( all things ) , showed 70 % european americans found it important keep their race alive , so fact there no major racial awareness two big parties us , should point fact something not right american politics . there should large basis identity politics even among european americans , i'm confident such party become large quite soon . people book various experiences , vary their age sex . author very objective unbiased , which rare books this touchy subject . people interviewed sometimes bit gloomy outlook , but seeing world europeans today , who blame them . i highly recommend book both already " converted " , those think racialists insane . both something gain reading this very interesting book	-1

if schizophrnic person killed someone blamed it angelic voices , would we then take position also blame angels , or would we just realize it person who crazy ? similarly , just because crazy people say islam(or christian inquisitions , or communism , or building colonial america ) their motivation violence , why look islam(or others ) when we should looking their craziness( i.e. unstated ulterior motivations ) instead ? so many large groups people tend oppress , kill , or enslave either other populations or those within their own borders . why believe their stated reasons it , rather than look more common thread : human population dynamics . sorry , he just who , instead sociologically looking violent tendencies almost all large groups people general throughout history across cultures , he simply wants attack islam . he may right what he says islam , unfortunately it doesn't really matter because it really just " red herring , " where he blames surface rather than cause : humans . religion so often abused " reason " crime , but haven't we realized we shouldn't believe what crazy people name their religion their religion ?	-1
called ' war peace ' version financial planners , i found this book surprisingly readable , its conclusions ( while obviously controversial ) least thought-provoking . there four large concepts beginning : increasing liquidity , safety , rate return , tax deductibility , considering ' big picture ' financial planning . it eye-opener read through his analysis how quickly taxes eat up any tax-deferred gain 401(k ) or ira , well how few options there saving both tax-deferred tax-free withdrawals . roth ira great but so limited , thus when you get main section book ( investing equity indexed universal life insurance contracts ) author delves into great detail how they work how they benefit you . many articles newspapers not look eiuls , they comparing book approach other universal life products ( such fixed-interest product - which reviewer below apparently , or variable universal life product , which isn't same , or whole-life product ) . i also found 7.5% return bit high , but after looking eiul more closely ( reading up sp500 returns historically ) 7.5% number used conservative one . douglas andrew gets into technical detail how properly setup eiul yield ' floor ' 1% ' cap ' 15 or 17% ; i.e. when sp goes down -5% , you still get 1% return , when it goes up 5% you get 5% , when it goes up 20% you capped 17% . although i found out these eiul around only last five years or so , back-testing this approach 50 years yields some 9.4% , it makes sense you getting upside sp investment without downside risk , thus it bit lower than historical 50-year sp return . this reviewer thinks ' hidden costs ' properly constructed eiul , 1% ( average over 20-year span ) very reasonable , pay both administration well insurance component , but it tax implications ( grow tax-deferred withdrawn tax-free ) seems too good true . i haven't started eiul policy yet , but am seriously considering it , everything i've able find not able refuted many confuse equity indexed universal life properly constructed implemented ( following tax rules/laws ) other vehicles similar but not offer kinds growth advantage nor cost advantage this . while it may seem extreme no longer fund 401(k ) its maximum limit purchase universal life insurance contract instead , tax perspective there seems compelling case here . least i convinced ( after paying mortgage off early age 39 my case ) money could put better use elsewhere	1

ira levin , hands down , best suspense thriller author out there . his novels quick affairs fun read but leave you thinking once it all over . like no other , levin make impossible situation seem entirely within realm possibility . robot housewives ? satanic babies ? hitler clones ? his career covers it all , circumstances just real enough make you wonder if it could happen you . " stepford wives " came out decade when feminism taking hold nation making future gender roles uncertain . would women leave home forever -- taking jobs away men who feel entitled them forcing them cook wash their own laundry ? not if men stepford , connecticut help it . through desperate , brutal actions stepford men association levin makes bold statements how women chained their home lives made sacrifice their own desires their very humanity sake their family . true success levin chilling parable how timeless it proven . sure , specific details become dated since 1972 publication date , but message still target -- just look tabloid-infused botox-ification society occurs today proof . " stepford wives " great summer read beach , vacations , or rainy days when you're stuck indoors . like " davinci code , " it intelligence woven into its pot-boiler outline -- but fortunately it better writing back it up . it guilty pleasure isn't so guilty after all . aside : " rosemary baby " " stepford wives " ( levin most famous works ) suffer some fact now most people know what happens end , but don't let deter you . joy getting there still carry you through nicely ; fun no longer surprise twist but picking up clues get you there ( think it seeing " sixth sense " knowing bruce willis dead still appreciating movie craftmanship hid it original audiences ) .	-1

if familiarity indeed breed contempt , then perhaps explains why my opinion cooper most famous novel weakened over time . i recently reread book after interval many years ; not only i disappointed ( somewhat bored ) , but i realized it become my least favorite five leatherstocking novels . " last mohicans , " cooper aimed brazenly melodramatic adventure story romantic tradition novels walter scott . reading it adult , farcical caricatures delighted me boy made me cringe times , almost embarrassment . ( particular , psalmist named david gamut cooper jar jar binks . ) overwrought dialogue cumbersome even unintentionally comical ; only natty ( " hawk-eye " ) bumppo would deliver 300-word speech hush his compatriots order avoid imminent risk possible ambush . several things save novel its maudlin prose , they alone justify its status " classic . " first unexpected depth portrayal cora . modern standards , her character stereotypically feminine , but she pioneering heroine whose depiction violates nearly every preconception era . second aspect unhesitant ( its time ) graphic horror which cooper depicts hand-to-hand combat ; shocking episode opens massacre garrison still ability give me nightmares . , finally , there cooper decidedly " unromantic " willingness surprise reader killing off major characters startling ( believable ) twists plot . set aside cartoonish characters , overstylized prose , speechifying dialogue -- story alone worth read . so it not bad book any means , opinions depend taste . i prefer character-driven narratives almost pastoral mood " pioneers " or " prairie , " which times seem anticipate survivalist novels willa cather . those who prefer swashbuckling action " ivanhoe , " however , this book	-1

this extremely well written summary first 35 years patrick o'brian/richard patrick russ/richard ross life . nikolai tolstoy superb job mapping parallels unattested portions his step-father life through detailed analysis o'brian 3rd autobiographical novel , richard temple . tolstoy interpretations measured credible . while critical certain points dean king portrait , he avoids getting excessively embroiled their differences . what i still am loss understand exactly what prompted o'brian name change end wwii , particularly given richard russ operated richard ross while working what appears one propaganda branches british intelligence during wwii . tolstoy teasingly describes how richard russ a.k.a. richard ross assumed identity academic phd italian university . richard/patrick escaping these lies ? other area remains unexplored patrick o'brian craftsmanship . tolstoy certainly makes clear russ/ross/o'brian leveraged many his life experiences when writing his short stories ( many themes reappear aubrey/maturin series ) . but how largely uneducated writer evolve such potent writing style . tolstoy himself no mere scribbler . writing very clear moves reader effortlessly . but what his subject beautiful style ? tolstoy apparently access manuscripts this earlier period . they tell us anything ? finally , i believe this book help readers look characters aubrey/maturin series , especially female characters , new richer ligh t.t olstoy currently working part ii his o'brian biography	1

read several different translations lysistrata , i report one you select may make all difference your opinion this early comedy . roche translation very vulgar but good footnotes : get ready cockney spartans , however . jack lindsay translation , 1925 ( included bantam edition aristophanes ) seems overly literary comparison original but lacks notes . it reads well , though sounds little old-fashioned . bawdry present but made less direct ; this one spartan dialect scottish . i found parker translation least satisfactory . " hillbilly " dialect he gives spartans painfully overdone , not mention inaccurate , speeches awkward pedestrian . excellent edition overall alan . sommerstein penguin classic " aristophanes : lysistrata other plays . " introduction notes extremely informative , translation itself strikes right note represent aristophanes ' style english . ( once again , though , spartans scots . ) but perhaps best choice sarah ruden 2003 edition . her dialogue unusually funny without straying too far original . added value comes her four very readable essays greek democracy , warfare , women , comedy . it also printed quality paper comes great cover	-1

this one first rendell books i read , it absolutely knocked me out . i recovering cold , lying bed enjoying it nicely , when it took turn made me sit up straight go , quot ; say what ? quot ; i forgot cold , forgot everything but following this hypnotic tale its strange end . i've now read it three times , each time it got more impressive . present standards sex violence , it may seem understated . somehow , these days excess , just makes it more powerful . rendell empress accidental , queen chaos theory . something tiny happens , something else tiny happens , somehow , inevitably , chance becomes destiny or whatever passes it . oh , her books lovely , dark , deep . open this one up , you'll miles go before you sleep	1
dashiel hammett , author such classics maltese falcon thin man , certainly deserves credit one originators noir genre . unfortunately red harvest doesn't live up this reputation . red harvest starts continental op arriving mining town personville ( sometimes called poisonville ) . he hired editor local paper , who turns up dead . this editor also son mining magnate elihu willsson , who called collection hooligans break strike . what he not foreseen inevitability criminals would take over town . originally i idea " red " title something socialist workers movement or wobblies , logical assumption since hammett communist , but hammett settles obvious , red meaning murder after murder continental op turns criminals against each other . blurb back book lauds hammett " sharply economically defined " characters . they're sharply defined all right , so sharply defined they all run together . pete finn , lew yard , max thaler noonan , chief police , could same character . beginning novel , continental op learns history conflict bill quint , i.w.w. organizer chicago , but that pretty much last we hear him . only interesting character whole book femme fatale , dinah brand , but her sole motivation seems money . hammett also problems resolution conflict . when painted into corner , he simply kills off character . even continental op pretty much cipher . he doesn't seem much background , other than he somewhat afraid old man , who runs continental detective agency . we know he smokes drinks too much even takes cocaine , but other than he doesn't live up his cool name . unfortunately all this reads like bad comic book . even hammett would good laugh what new york times said red harvest , i would assume 1929 when it published : " red harvest more than superb crime novel : it classic exploration corruption violence american grain . " i'll give him two stars noir dialogue , but rest it pretty much dreck .	-1

luigi pirandello 1921 play " six characters search author " ( " sei personaggi cerca d'autore " ) deserved reputation first existentialist drama profound effect later playwrights , especially those practitioners theater absurd such samuel beckett ( " waiting godot " ) , eugene ionesco ( " rhinoceros " ) , jean genet ( " maids " ) . pirandello writing often focuses elements madness , illusion isolation , all which inspired tragic aspects his personal life which his wife went insane his daugther tried commit suicide . 1921 during five week period pirandello wrote his two acknowledged masterpieces , " six characters search author " " henry iv . " while " six characters " successful when it opened rome it also considered scandalous . however , it soon performed milan , london , new york , germany . because his great influence modern theater , pirandello awareded noble prize literature 1934 . two years later , while negotiations appear film version " six characters , " he died . setting " six characters search author " rehearsal play ( pirandello ) interrupted arrival six characters . their leader , father , tells manager they looking author . it seems author who created them never finished their story they unrealized characters who not yet fully brought life . father insists they not real people but characters , manager his cast only laugh idea . but then they become intrigued bits pieces story six characters tell . father intellectual who married mother , peasant woman . however , she fell love his male secretary father , bored his wife , encouraged her leave . she , leaving behind eldest son who embittered abandonment . mother three children this other man but then father starts miss her watches other children grow up . this new family moves away , but after other man dies mother her children return city . mother gets job madame pace dress shop , but it turns out brothel where step-daughter ends up employed . one day father shows up set up step-daughter . however , mother stops them reaching obvious conclusion entire family moves father resentful son . manager agrees produce their story become author whom they searching . he tries stage scene where father meets step-daughter dress shop but both characters insist what actors doing not realistic . manager allows them finish out scene instead . this sets up basic juxtaposition " drama " " reality " rest play , key scenes lives these characters providing more questions than they answer what happened what it means . point when manager no longer tell difference acting reality he becomes fed up entire thing ends rehearsal , providing audience already challenged these changing notions reality abrupt ending drama . almost all characters play known their roles rather than their names , such leading man second female lead . one few characters drama who name madame pace , who charge dress shop also serves brothel where step-daughter works . it perhaps this formality serves distance us production more than strangeness action or aged words , even though they adapted modern ear . there may or may not real story here , but ultimate point this play tradition reality theater no longer holds true . radical idea here there immutability reality these six characters . because they forms , forced into performing actions which they imagined , there inherent conflict life . this why son wants escape but cannot leave studio must play his role , must mother rest characters . this just true all other characters besides six , although others less inclined see truth , or least reality , their own situation until end , when final scene drama seeks dissolve " stage " reality completely . where pirandello succeeds end it both ways , we interpret what we seen reality or acting . either way , you left same conclusion .	1

bringing their only child into world , making lifetime commitment each other , changed everything chris sue rouse when they faced her unplanned pregnancy . chris 18 years old , still high school , when chris jr. - known throughout his life " chrissy " - arrived . sue gave up her dreams college , career , world travel so young couple could build business family instead . eventually they succeeded so well financially chris could afford such hobbies owning his own small airplane . then he discovered scuba diving , sport which he promptly introduced both sue chrissy ; rouse family lives changed again . never inclined toward doing anything halves , they soon moved recreational diving - relatively safe pursuit - adrenaline rush cave diving . rouses earned respect remarkably short time among their fellow cave divers , they made hundreds dives thoroughly mastered incredibly dangerous sport . next chris chrissy turned their attention open ocean wreck diving , which they applied their cave diving knowledge . into this new least equally perilous ( possibly more so ) universe , sue followed her men less eagerly . chris chrissy found kindred spirit bernie chowdhury , fellow cave diver also intrigued transferring sport principles diving inside shipwrecks . when chowdhury survived agonizing , temporarily crippling potentially fatal case bends , after pushing his body his skills too far during wreck dive forced choose drowning surfacing without hours life-saving decompression , rouses listened his story hoped learn it . yet they found themselves facing same decision during dive wreck mysterious german u-boat nicknamed u-who , after business reverses forced them cut corners supporting their expensive hobby . it alone , trying get compressed air dive so deep rouses would safer breathing more expensive " trimix " avoid nitrogen narcosis ? or there other factors , less obvious ones , leading up father son team fatal last dive ? author chowdhury book only partly loving memorial his two friends ' memory . it also analysis what motivates , often obsesses , not just cave wreck divers ; but everyone who pursues extreme sports require constant ( often escalating ) risk one life . his fascination rooted his own terrifyingly close brush not only death , but permanent physical disability . he not only interested why divers , mountain climbers , etc . pursue such sports ; he also wants understand why such men women rarely deterred hearing , or even witnessing , others ' fatal or crippling mishaps . while i notice some other reviewers not pleased chowdury personal narratives included this book , i found those narratives completely necessary achieving author purpose . i thought same details rouse family life , which illuminated chris chrissy behavior they made series decisions what turned out their final morning alive . no , this isn't shadow divers . if you've read both books , you must noticed puzzled - i - total disconnect john chatterton behavior during coast guard evacuation rouses dive boat seeker , chowdury described it here it described ( entirely different terms ) shadow divers . chowdury isn't accomplished author whom writing career . he simply man important story tell , who my opinion fine job doing exactly . nothing more ; but nothing less , either .	-1

i agree . seifert review . this book might thought provoking , eye opening , or supposedly mind-blowing some teenager who never considered technology might not meaning life , but any adult who already thought way beyond coupland very obvious comments modern society , book nothing new or interesting say wasn't all entertaining way . middle book , i actually enjoying plot wanted read more see how things turned out self-obsessed whiners ( " oh , i'm so lonely .

peter singer long since proven himself one most important influential ethical utilitarian philosophers 20th century . however , when singer steps into realm politics things get little murky ; this book , " one world " analysis globalization its effects , it less than perfect work . instance , singer provides thorough background information harmful effects industry environment form greenhouse gas emissions , then moves into section politics international law . now problem his research majority sources he cites footnotes outdated web pages no longer accessed , hardly something you want ground your beliefs globalization . exception this source footnote 33 page 45 " one atmosphere " chapter , which links excellent website detailing u . . ' steadily increasing rate carbon dioxide emissions which confirm his claims . unfortunately , number these online resources singer cites cannot reached , i'm referring now footnotes 5 6 chapter 1 which details u.n. reports , footnotes 2 4 chapter 2 also not available , footnotes 10 , 11 , 20 , 35 , 37 , 59 chapter 3 , " one economy , " these just sampling sources i checked . majority this highly unreliable data , it not just websites , singer relies very heavily thomas friedman biased book " lexus olive tree , " see footnotes 15 , 16 , 17 chapter 1 . clearly there dilemma people who serious this topic after reading through singer notes . hell , maybe every single source cited this book correct , but i couldn't verify great deal it . but that just one complaint i book ; addition , singer indicates me he just isn't expert politics any sense word . instance , when discussing international law humanitarian intervention initiatives , singer simply confuses political " authority " political " legitimacy " outright . not only , but he proceeds discuss genocide crimes against humanity regard democratic political systems without offering any kind working definition democracy . i wonder if he realizes so-called democracy u.s. contributed genocide east timor . anyway , i've said before singer excellent ethical philosopher , but his politics pretty amateurish . perhaps my biggest complaint book singer failure analyze connection rise globalization rise poverty , pollution , war , etc . he simply describes globalization phenomenon , detailing facets wto so , without offering much thoughtful connection phenomenon other ethical concerns book . put it simply , singer ultimately cops out offering normative judgment globalization whole , preferring instead move other issues like international law nationalism , issues me least intimately related globalization . book some good insights offer ; final section where singer analyzes u . . ' frugal contributions third world countries particularly striking , he offers some insightful solutions solving problems global poverty suffering . additionally , he offers some interesting criticisms john rawls ' work political justice his failure address issues justice differing societies . yet , i'm afraid this book too many problems recommend or rely , but i'm sure there many superior books globalization readers who willing look .	-1

when i bought this book , intially i open mind toilet training methods , but after reading this book i am sceptical child centred technique . reasons outlined book circular logic which makes no sense me . also , some suggestions seemed just silly me - instance , advice change active baby dirty nappy bath while she pulls herself up down ! dr brazelton outlines reasons changing child centred technique 60 - prevent high occurrence failure rigid early training schedules which involved punishment shame . much more rigorous study than one which dr brazelton describes would looked age training use punishment independently , then drawn conclusions what causing high failure rate . study conducted it impossible conclude which two factors - early age or punishment- more harmful . dr brazelton gives list signs readiness then assumes no child these signs before age 2 . i feel this greatly underestimating our children , also patronising other cultures around world ( who don't live " our mainstream hygienic culture " ) who train their children much younger age . i feel this book could very confusing parents they endlessly wait their child exhibit all signs readiness none signs not ready . but some signs child not ready could due waiting too long ; example , 1 . child sits toilet then pees soon after standing up : this could also due child made longstanding habit peeing standing up which possible diaper ; 2 . child not uncomfortable dirty diaper : this could also because child diapers so long , he conditioned accept walking around faeces smeared his bottom ! dr brazelton strongly emphasizes toilet training should up child it his achievement . course ! no one else control his muscles ! why then this only possible after certain age ? book , he desribes how he pre-empts toilet training questions 12 18 month checkups strongly advises parents not start until after age 2 . this me smacks interference well beyond what appropriate patient doctor . no wonder parents confused - they told ignore knowledge their own child . final note , i'm bit tired hackneyed advice " don't worry , your child won't diapers college " seems so prevalent toilet training experts . more point , " your child still diapers when he goes school ? " , which seems like possibility if you endlessly wait all signs readiness . perhaps then your child could attend dr brazelton toilet school untrained 4-6 year olds .	-1

several reviewers submitted highest life aristotle proposes consists " hard work " or " most difficult life . " i am afraid this language not accurately present aristotle description . aristotle writes these lecture notes contemplative life " superior human level " ( 1177b27 ) . yet , he distinguishes it secondary lives saying these secondary lives " require trouble " ( 1177b18 ) . aristotle calls contemplative life most pleasant life ( 1177a25ff ) . certainly , study hard work ; but this not hard work sense toil . work towards truth contemplate it once attained requires little strain . it virtuous agent right action any given circumstance : ease . through influence kant ( possibly stoics ) , we often associate virtue denying passions overcoming greatest obstacles ; likewise , we associate vice passions overcoming reason . this sense , most virtuous person would no passions all . however , aristotle suggests passions only conflict reason lower moral character . when reason prevails one right action against passion urges , he calls this ' enkrasia ' ; when passions overcome , he calls this ' akrasia ' . however , internal discord present these characters not present virtuous ( vicious ) . virtuous character most reliable participates definition virtue itself because agent habituated passions follow reason . his or her passions actually encourage agent what right .

orville schell works always exquisite . written crisp style , penetrating analysis , his books never failed breathe life into their subjects leave reader more informed than before . expecting same tour de force found mandate heaven discos democracy , i not disappointed virtual tibet : searching shangri-la himalayas hollywood . schell tackles topic receives plenty discussion fanfare , but experienced precious little objective study recent years . tibet labored under political cultural repression people republic china since 1951 . many believe china slowly committing cultural genocide through its repression tibetan religious cultural customs encouraging vast numbers han chinese settle tibet . help charismatic dalai lama throngs hollywood stars , tibetan issue received disproportionate amount attention relative its importance world events . whereas one struggles find quot ; free east timorquot ; bumper stickers cars , quot ; free tibetquot ; stickers far more ubiquitous . strong point schell work his analysis hollywood fascination tibet . he interviews many most visible promoters tibetan cause also provides fly-on- the-wall accounts numerous quot ; free tibetquot ; hollywood functions making movies kundun seven years tibet . through his interviews observations , schell largely confirms what i suspected years . hollywood promotion tibetan cause less its relative merits than it fact it become fashionable issue which associated . tibetan cause become virtual rohrsach test which hollywood supporters use feel better what ails them spiritually politically . schell works demonstrate uncanny ability meeting all right people convincing them reveal their true feelings . instead communist party officials or chinese gangsters his previous works , schell somehow able elicit revealing quotes otherwise elusive individuals such steven seagal brad pitt . although nobody complained misquoted my knowledge , i hope this reflects schell skill interviewer . it would shame if writer journalist schell quality needed embellish his subject words better copy . schell succeeds making subject tibetan history more entertaining general reader without sacrificing content . schell virtual tibet informative well-rounded work , lifting much mystique esoteric , yet prominent subject . while schell sympathizes their cause , he able remove veil motivation hollywood tibetan supporters . many readers may expected schell delve deeper into issues surrounding china tibet , but this would required schell tread over already well- traveled terrain . deciding leave debate over relative merits chinese policies toward tibet aside , schell produced original thoughtful work journalism . schell portrayal main protagonists tibetan cause unflattering bound upset many people . this hallmark fine journalist	-1

" star wars : empire strikes back , " written donald . glut , recounts epic tale 1980 " star wars : episode v-the empire strikes back , " sequel " star wars : new hope . " i found some things different movie rather interesting , first which yoda color blue instead pale green , second he gnaws his gimer stick , unseen me movie . this added story me terms who he how he acted . other things , though , seemed take away story . there wasn't great deal detail . this true previous novel , but this time fact everything little vague didn't always help fuel imagination . i liked author often used word " sword " instead " lightsaber , " but he never told reader color luke sword vader sword ( or if they both colorless ); i already knew colors just because i seen movie , but book seemed written someone who already seen movie ( fact very little americans not seen movie beside point ) when it supposed written anyone his target audience . he one point said battle taking place going back-and-forth red green laser blasts , but who green who red ? leaving some things imagination ( like how people look , their facial expressions ) okay , but if author going describe how something looks , he should finish job , not leave it halfway . this would still yet okay certain authors ' styles , but this author style doesn't seem tell it righ t.t here certain moments book should given more weight . they certainly depth , i could still vividly imagine what happening how it happening such rich atmosphere , but everything seems weighed evenly . when luke finds out yoda jedi master whom he searching , it just happens . author comes point where luke makes discovery then author just moves . book never sits down reader thinks , feels , wonderful moments . moment movie , well soundtrack , given great weight , but this book just tells tale too quickly without delight . same true when luke discovers darth vader his father . it just happens . author then , omniscient third-person view , describes luke thoughts , yet somehow author dries everything up reader . author gives fair weight what happening-yoda standing corner luke discovers jedi master ; luke fighting vader cloud city-when weight should given words they speak . book spendid just any moment yoda luke . luke well described too much pride his successes , yoda character comes alive . he described exactly how he should , which say he seems goofy first , yet you discover it not goofiness ; it yoda incredible jedi teacher . he may not even great teacher author describes it , but it described such delight . magic tree particularly enchanting ; luke goes off search cave because he feels dark side , he finds darth vader , or just mystical trick . i actually liked it better here book than movie . luke bewildered , chapter ends yoda gnawing his gimer stick . way author presents it so mystical , so enchanting , my eyes wide open even though i reading it very late night ( morning ) . chapter ended , i fell back my seat just wondering what happened me . i laughed . i really laughed this time . watching " star wars " movies over over again seems make it all dry sand me unless i consciously make sure i enjoy it , but reading this book really made me laugh ; han solo leia organa really some verbally delightful moments showing their affection or lack thereof ; this book got much wit movie . i'm sure i remember laughing whenever yoda nonchalanty went gnawing his gimer stick while luke struggled complete his daunting , seemingly impossible jedi training tasks . this book really makes characters spring life . " star wars : empire strikes back " tells epic tale told book format , highly recommended all " star wars " fans ; it little more classic science-fictionndash ; oriented , so i would recommend it any sci-fi reader well . some parts fans hold such high esteem movies told without any delight or without any weight , but depth still there , other scenes certainly delightful enough worth read . overall , it good book , emotional , powerful , enchanting ; everything here	-1
