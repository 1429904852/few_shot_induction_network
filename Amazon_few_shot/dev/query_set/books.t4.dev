carr provides stirring indictment belief it brings it promise competitive advantage . instead , he posits it merely cost doing business , cut same cloth other innovations once held lot promise like electricity railway system . though no company ever hope operate much less compete without above , its homogeneity prevalence somehow blunted its value . search elusive silver bullet found ceo bequeathing so much power it good number expected it rescue bad business plans . carr mentions specific examples it inability mask business problems but rather makes them more apparent earlier . one major point i find hard believe window innovation it closed . though lot strides made , lot work yet . however , i fear carr would proven prescient even seminal this particular point short term . though it people continue churn out next line killer applications , there danger customers may simply refuse upgrade or purchase thereby sealing it fate commodity . interesting thought gleaned book it ( automation ) frees people far more important tasks . however , what those important tasks not clearly defined . granting most tasks automated , it lead more unemployment , surplus products ( assuming productivity rises because it ) , low prices profits until next new thing discovered disrupt balance once again . but this hasn't happened ye t.t hough i don't agree some carr ideas , i believe it good read dissenting opinions future it .	1

tropic cancer henry miller . not recommended . his 1960 introduction tropic cancer , karl shapiro said , " i call henry miller greatest living author because i think he , " " . . . spiritual example he stands among great men our age , " " . . . he [ orwell ] predicts miller set pace attitude novelist future . this not happened yet , but i agree it must . " shapiro not support any these points his essay , nothing tropic cancer supports them , either . tropic cancer consists 318 pages recounting miller experience american expatriate paris expounding his personal philosophy , often ways rambling painfully nonsensical . miller stories his friends tedious , pointless , catty ; like miller , they seem talentless hacks whose belief their own artistic abilities makes them artists writers , though believing . miller writes , " year ago , six months ago , i thought i artist . i no longer think it , i am " -- which type arrogant pretentiousness he mocks virtually all his acquaintances . when they not creating , or talking philosophy or creating , miller his circle seem spend nearly every moment picking up women ( disease ) . they rarely use neutral term such " woman " when there so many obscene , demeaning words which objectify gender . women miller friends find invariably portrayed stupid , drunken , irrational , loose , sly , deceptive , good primarily one function , which miller turns into squalid , cold , joyless act . spite all vice " living , " no one seems fun , some characters , notably fillmore , find themselves nearly trapped into bourgeoisie life . miller expresses contempt machine , industrial age , money -- although he schemes keep 2,800 francs fillmore mistress revels so much his pocket . often hungry , miller obsesses food relies his friends support him . when he describes his indian friend kepi " . . . scrounger , sort human tick who fastens himself hide even poorest compatriot , " he could talking himself he bitterly complains those his friends who stingy money , accommodations , food , wine . miller logic working world facile ; he writes , " if you want bread , you've got get harness , get lockstep . " surface , this true , but it never seems occur him , if you want bread , someone must cultivate , raise , harvest wheat produce other components ; someone must transform these components into bread ; someone must deliver it shops cafes . other words , if most people weren't " lock step , " miller could choose starve or set himself produce bread , joining world harness . he makes his choice clear , then whines it . he may despise those who support him , whether they friends or workers , but perhaps because he , misanthrope who finds fault everyone but himself , needs very people he denigrates ( including " grocer , baker , shoemaker , butcher , etc . -- all imbecilic-looking clodhoppers " ) , reliance which he resents . he hates machine machine mind , but offers no alternatives . seemingly incapable sincere feeling , miller finds human emotion amusing . when friend says , " boy break your heart . . . he so damned beautiful ! so cruel ! " miller writes , " we laugh this . it sounded preposterous . but collins earnest . " when acquaintance whom he owes money dies , he writes , " any rate , he killed automobile accident shortly after my arrival , circumstance which left me twenty-three francs good . " shapiro claims miller poet , but his attempts poetic philosophic ramblings often make little if any sense . speaking buildings statues , miller says , " . . . they must saturated my anguish , " kind bad metaphor which he frequently indulges . he describes artists such himself " inhuman ones . " " i am inhuman ! i say it mad , hallucinated grin , i keep saying it though it rain crocodiles . behind my words all those grinning , leering , skulking skulls , some dead grinning long time , some grinning if they lockjaw , some grinning grimace grin , foretaste aftermath what always going . " whenever these attempts poetic philosophy appeared , rambling pages , i found myself yearning return his insipid stories prostitutes , disease , friends , hunger . tropic cancer perhaps worst book i ever read ( i promise myself i would read tropic capricorn ) . shapiro says , " there not many these emancipated beings left our world [ emancipated what ? -- dls ] , these clowns clairvoyants , celebrants soul flesh still-remaining promise america . " if miller , his whining , his criticism , his holier-than-everyone attitude , his " art , " his two-dimensional view people , his obsession excrement , " greatest " these souls , may i never meet least . note : if there 0 stars option , tropic cancer would earned it	-1
it through alistair cockburn earlier writings i ' got it ' good people , not methodologies tools , deliver successful projects . although crystal clear meant only small teams ( there crystal color every size team ) , properties , practices , principles , examples techniques this book would benefit any software development team . subtitle begins " human-powered methodology ...

unlike most science-related books , there only few pages within this biography dealt diagrams equations . majority novel consisted stunning information regarding life mind james clerk maxwell , who often forgotten general public favor more prolific figures such joule farraday . although i'll go far admit high schooler , this type literature not my favorite , i surprised find this book captivated imagination allowed insight not just into work but into mind maxwell . research purposes , this book contains very useful index efficient easy fact-finding . furthermore , technical diagrams equations explained very well , sufficient time patience could understood . most amazing maxwell life career . his early entry into science math ( age 16 ) both awesome inspiring . basil mahon brings maxwell achievement into plain view ease language interesting style writing so rarely found science books today	1
all poems smooth clever slightly ( or more than slightly ) ironic . they sometimes make me smile , but they seldom make me feel much . i recently poetry reading collins gave , where he greatly applauded . he mentioned sentimentality cardinal sin poetry . that true . but i couldn't emotionally connect self-consciously witty voices speaking out his poems , end this collection i didn't really want . when i first read collins , i hoping find accessible poet illuminating everyday world i promised . instead , i found extremely polished poet whose engaging tone almost makes up his persistent lack emotional depth . sentimentality may poetic sin , but sincerity isn't . even funny poems should display little emotional risk . but collins never seems risk anything . because he takes small risks , we get small rewards . go ahead get this book . read it . smile bit . appreciate cleverness talent collins displays . these poems likeable , i wouldn't surprised if you liked them . but if you looking poetry feed you , go somewhere else	-1

i love victor conte . you know , way you love bad guy great movie ? you don't actually love him , but you love character , kind " best actor nominee " thing . two san francisco chronicle reporters lay out their case against conte his giant client , barry bonds , bonds passes babe ruth eyes hank aaron all-time home run record ( josh gibson sadaharu oh ? ) . conte himself alleged source much material . investigations continue : spring 2006 , bonds ' ex-girlfriend , kim bell , allegedly asked fbi not cooperate investigation major league baseball doing ; greg anderson , bonds ' trainer , jailed july 2006 refusing testify grand jury . authors present extensive evidence use steroids track field , provided olympic athletes conte under cover his nutritional supplements company , increasingly sophisticated efforts mask such use . but it barry bonds allegations ( accompanying details other major leaguers , efforts explain mark mcgwire glory bonds ' motivation ) sell book . this book makes bonds look much worse than i thought it would , i no fan already . reader learns , example , his " control freak " his teammates , women , staff " friends . " my own judgment authors easily surpass " preponderance evidence " probably " beyond reasonable doubt " , even if they don't video bonds syringe labeled " clear .

king certainly lends high-profile this collection latter-day noir writing tough-guy procedurals , but i believe he created something little too far outside readership expected genre this series . setting characters recognizable ( now trite ? ) staples his beloved maine coast , he works bringing their " down east " mannerisms life language rings " bert i " lobstermen . i wasn't particularly caught up aged newspapermen tale their quest identify mysterious dead man found local beach . ending ... well , um ... ending definitely open-ender . king cleverly covers himself adding disclaimer sorts story won't appeal many readers . yep . you got right , stephen . no gunplay , no boozers , no saucy dames , no double-crosses , no slangy patter , no real satisfaction me . i suggest hard crime afficionados skip this entry look some heavy-hitters past	-1

this sermon all grace -- inconceivable grace holy patient god . we live " god love " age , where loving father grace would never ever put someone hell because their " weakness " . that what jehovah witnesses believe , that what modern christians come believe too . we adopted this ultragracious innocuous image god , i believe , two principle reasons : 1 ) we like selectively read scriptures . negating hell judgment passages more tolerable " god graceful loving " ones , we reconstruct our own likeness into god who now become eternal " good god " no emotions but love giving helping blessing -- god who advocates our carnal lifestyles , only worthy notice during christmas easter holidays , when devastation hits our lives . 2 ) we rationalize his character our own human standards . we ascribe certain attributes god logical us , what we deem fair . after all , isn't god all justice ? mercy ? no earthly judge would ever consign man fiery torture lifetime -- nevermind eternity ! this , we therefore decide , no way accurate image god . we'll often recite scriptures where jesus forgave woman caught adultery , or compassion multitudes , or ate dinner sinners , or preached sermon mount loving your enemies not repaying evil evil . yes , he all -- jesus christ , prince peace . many say here , " yep . jesus ' sermon mountain didn't scare people , it all love grace good things , blessings givings so forth ... " just like moon " dark " side , there also side god . jesus talked , warned , pleaded , wept it . awful justice holy eternal god . jesus talked more his father justice punishment wicked than his love righteous . god doesn't fool around sin . if he annihilated sodom gomorrah fire because their sexual immorality , his own son nailed cross , you really believe he'll spare any man or women who stands before him " awful day " unrepentant sin ? all throughout old new testaments , his prophets warned impending day fire wrath . joel called it " terrible day lord " , paul called it " judgment seat christ " , john called it " lake fire " , jesus called it " place eternal torment " , john baptist called it " day wrath " . david spoke it pslams ! every one " love scripture " you throw me , i give you three which warn god reserved wrath wicked . you tell me god loves sinner , but hates sin . but bible says god hates sinner well ( see psalm 5:4 ) . bible also says god angry wicked every day ( see psalm 7:11 ) . if you've read my review thus far , you're probably angry . this may indication you either : 1 ) don't know full character god , or 2 ) sin doesn't grieve your heart like it grieves holy spirit , or 3 ) you've never born again spirit desire holiness purity which , according bible , only acceptable lifestyle before god . jonathan edwards puritan preacher . these guys after purity ( hence , puritan ) holiness lord . today , 250 years later , we lost sight this . today , gospel jesus christ politically-correct , inoffensive , recreational powerless motivational philosophy success gain . gospel no power change lives because we refuse live holiness reverential fear awesome terrible god . we've instead created our own god our own ideals contructed his character out our own acceptable worldly attributes centered around our own standards success , comfort , tolerance . we need truth come back pulpits . away all unctionless motivational speaking passes gospel preaching today . when jonathan edwards preached his sermon 1741 , people fell out their chairs cried out , " what must we saved !

i love clif bars , especially " carrot cake " flavor ! when i saw this book ceo founder company , i picked it up right away . it always insightful read people who founded or run companies get inside look how they built organization what they value . where most business books focus financials , strategy how successful their market , it rarer find company very successful financially while still placing their values higher priority than profit-at-all-costs culture plagues many organizations . book describes detail founding company , almost storybook beginnings his moms kitchen . what started desire create " sports bar " didn't taste like dirt , turned into quality well known brand . while these types rags riches stories may sounding familiar , this path actually quite different . gary describes his passions biking , travel climbing , how he learned value environment focus his company sustainable growth . when his competitors becoming part large conglomerates resources outspend out market his brand , he resisted lure millions sell company chose remain private . i found myself marking pages , pondering quotes , admiring spirit values gary brought organization . he describes difference " red path " " white path " . developed through analogy taking roads less traveled , traveling light his numerous bike trips europe , he discovers real joy journey not destination . those who take " white path " play it safe , make kinds business decisions accountants love . those who take " red path " stay true their values , must sometimes take risks others would fear order ensure vision upheld . those who enjoy business strategy , book contains plenty . steps business sustainability values hiring right people creating right culture employees outlined described . also , like howard shultz few others , gary chooses honest his doubts , his mistakes , his fears . this way , book more inspiring than typical academic controlled business planning tools most consultants business leaders use replace passion leadership . i recommend this book highly . if you feel there something missing your company , workplace become unending unsatisfying grind , then prepare inspired encouraged . it refreshing know there still business leaders who understand life more than their balance sheet . great example company willing give back community try make world better place . company leader who not only believe their employees inherent value human beings , but treat them such .	1

despite president bush declaration he wanted bin laden " dead or alive , " hunted world mightiest military last five years , osama remains large shrouded mystery . nor osama become " " - 2003 saw more significant terror attacks than any year within past 20 , while 2004 brought doubling again . thus , bush 3/02 claim bin laden marginalized no basis fact . nor osama accomplishments limited 9/11 . within four years osama cnn declaration war against u.s. his organization bombed two u.s. embassies africa , attacked u.s.s. cole yemen , helped drive u.s. out somalia , course , wtc attack - more damage u.s. than soviet union during nearly five decades cold war . every day osama remains large propaganda victory al qaeda . we need understand bin laden , not confused our own propaganda - eg . he never expressed interest attacking west because our " freedoms . " ( fact , bergen book includes direct osama quote refuting point - suggesting if so , one should wonder why he hadn't attacked sweden . ) peter bergen draws interviews over 50 individuals who known bin laden personally , plus his own interview . number written video materials , including ten years jihad magazine , also utilized . material presented objective manner , invaluable one wanting better understand bin laden his motives - both prior 9/11 , through iraq war . " oral history " begins osama early days . his father very , very anti-israel . he educated good school , very polite ( attribute maintained into adulthood ) , but not stand-out student . osama also quite religious , even his youth . rather than inheriting $200-$300 million fortune , bergen believes more credible figure around $20 million ( there 53 siblings which share ) . 1979 soviet invasion afghanistan shocked bin laden , thousands other devout young muslims - it first time since wwii non-muslim power invaded muslim country . bin laden involvement began donor , then holy warrior . most who knew his military involvement scornful , seeing he no military skills probably simply creating martyrs . further , bergen concludes osama impact very limited - number afghans fighting soviets varied 175-250 , 000 , while number arabs involved any point no more than few hundred , split several groups . thus , " real " outcome determined afghans themselves , together aid provided $3 billion u.s. aid ( no evidence any it went afghan arabs ) , additional support saudi arabia . bin laden victory vs . russians jaji ' 87 only p.r. accomplishment involving 50-60 arabs ( including bin laden ) over 22 day period . osama also spent six months building road through tora bora mountains ' 87 ( jaji jalalabad ) , gaining familiarity undoubtedly benefited when u.s. invaded 2001 . ayman al zawahiri , bin laden chief deputy , radicalized three years ' imprisonment torture egypt , part reaction sadat assassination ( not involved ) . he got osama focus not only afghan jihad , but also regime change arab world ( ousting repressive secular regimes , which also supported u . . ) . after soviets left afghanistan ' 89 country slipped into civil war - first drive out communist regime left behind , then various afghan factions . osama washed his hands area moved sudan . while there osama journeyed back saudi arabia made speeches against both u.s. ( its support moving one million russian jews israel ) saddam hussein . he even volunteered services his afghan arab veterans , plus new recruits , repel hussein kuwait - turned down preference more americans " last straw " osama - he turned against saudi royal family , ultimately his citizenship revoked . drug monies offered support osama efforts - he declined , not wanting " profit " blood innocent people . this point osama four wives - three university lecturers spinsters whom he married support islamic principles . osama opposed ' 92 landing 28,000 americans somalia food relief , seeing it part larger american strategy take over islamic world . same time , ramzi yousef masterminded ' 93 wtc bombing - he trained al qaeda camp . bomb itself cost $ 20,000 ; rationale u.s. support israel . osama repeatedly challenged actions killed children other innocents . his response reference u.s. atomic bombing nagasaki hiroshima , well purported loss one million iraqi children due u . . -supported sanctions . bergen also reports prior 9/11 afghan used gofer both osama british cameraman wanted help tell u.s. al qaeda planning hijack jets u.s. secure release " blind sheikh " held wtc bombing . fbi ended up both delaying his movement thailand meeting him - until after 9/11 . bergen states bin laden not involved 9/11 details ( nor those cole , etc . bombings ) . nonetheless , he ultimate commander , knew plans , supported effort . bergen also believes bin laden made serious error projecting u.s. reaction - he hoped , based prior u.s. actions eg . lebanon , u.s. would withdraw middle east , or invade afghanistan become bogged down protracted guerrilla war . instead , u.s. used 300 special forces troops ground , massive airpower , northern alliance forces quickly defeat al qaeda . " osama ... i know " also presents credible information knowledgeable sources refute rumor osama suffers form acute kidney disease - just low blood pressure foot wound incurred fighting soviets . bergen rather critical u.s. vs . osama escape afghanistan . sources clearly place bin laden there ( including bin laden himself ) only 300 others - yet he got away . bergen claims there more american journalists scene than u.s. soldiers . " acquiring nuclear chemical weapons religious duty " - osama , ' 99 . bergen sources , however , doubtful than osama any success acquiring nuclear capability , though he apparently scammed effort . osama opposed efforts foment civil war shia sunni , reports bergen ; meanwhile , zarqawi not join al qaeda until ' 04 - two years after sec . powell claimed iraq harboring zarqawi major al qaeda figure his effort justify invading iraq . bergen sees greater danger future iraq " foreign fighters " after iraq struggle than their afghan counterparts . rationale - their experience fighting stronger u.s. army focus urban strategies ( ieds suicide bombers ) . bergen also makes strong criticism u.s. intelligence efforts . he notes there over 30 audio videotapes bin laden his chief deputy post 9/11 , one guaranteed method finding them tracing back their chain custody . even knowing tape would likely delivered al jazeera pakistan bureau prior 2004 election u.s. failed stake out scene . thus , our $30+ billion proven totally inadequate . finally , bergen also quite critical bin laden strategies-to-date , noting his efforts remake muslim world not succeeded - u.s. more involved than ever . further , taliban ahs destroyed . bergen believes without u.s. invasion iraq fragmented islam militant movement would imploded year or so post 9/11 . bottom line : al qaeda no attractive vision world it seeks create - best it associated creating taliban-like control over other muslims	1
i admire ishiguro writing risk-taking book , most unlike any i read befire . unfortunately , this novel fails its objectives , except itself unique piece fiction . protagonist english detective , who appears completely delusional his current circumstances , who willing take these delusions great lengths . because this , plot eventually becomes irrelevant reality . this when book shows its signs brilliance , when plot recognized meaningless major themes take over chinese battle . unfortunately this brilliant culmination hardly makes up rest novel . besides poor/meaningless plot , novel not single character reader cares . thematic sequence , during which book finally seems something , all too fleeting . soon after plot returns even more absurd than before . it truly frustrating experience	-1

coming panzer leader , i didn't know much eastern front . after reading it , i great grip what happened why . guderian writes short , succinct , declarative prose , which makes reading breeze . readers not interested fine details may put off sheer depth guderian account , but those passages dense only because sheer volume information guderian relays , not his writing style . german high command gets once over , particularly interesting guderian character sketches hitler goering . i not know enough guderian judge his flat denial any knowledge pertaining final solution or einsatztruppe , but sheer military point view you can't any better than panzer leader . guderian walks reader through conquests poland france , through army group center involvement operation barbarossa . he never hesitates point out where he disagreed general staff , describes detail his frustration okh okw . especially interesting early parts book where guderian describes his efforts get tanks accepted german command viable force battlefield , subsequent formation panzer divisions . this easily one best books i ever read , definitely one most informative . i learned ton reading this , loved every page it . those not interested military history probably find it dense hard get through , though . i'm giving it 5 stars despite drawback - this book simply indispensable military history enthusiasts wwii buffs	1

i hate alex portnoy , protragonist novel , yet i couldn't stop reading this book . me , that sign talented writer . main character few , if any , redeeming characteristics . he egomaniac . he inconsiderate . he obsessed sex . he nasty human almost every way , yet ( long you're not easily offended ) you can't stop reading him . " portnoy complaint " written if it words patient confessing his shrink . portnoy wants know what wrong himself , but before he find out he shares his life story childhood his mid-thirties , vast majority his story revolves around his relationship his parents , jewish , his obsession sex . i think what makes portnoy fascinating there probably little bit him every man , though few us may comfortable admitting it . so it interesting read him male perspective . female perspective i'd imagine he would interesting character if only because he shows just how depraved man . i guarantee after reading book you'll able identify least one portnoy your life -- someone who wasted their talents selfish pursuits , yet they so egotistical they blame their shortcomings everyone else , including their parents . this book ridiculously funny because no matter how absurd it gets , you can't help but realize it all too close truth	1
here it , final book creator/writer grant morrison invisibles series . books 1-3 collected volume 1 , books 4-6 collected volume 2 , book 7 collects volume 3 its entirety . previous two volumes over twenty issues each , but volume 3 only 12 issues , something which seems spark much debate , these days . i seen many claims volume 3 only 12 issues due low sales , dc/vertigo requested morrison wrap up his series half time , cut costs . this simply not true . volume 3 morrison full vision ; nothing cut out due editorial constraints . here morrison exact words , shortly before beginning volume 3 : " volume 3 appear three four-part arcs-`satanstorm ' ; `karmageddon ' `the invisible kingdom'- 1999 . then it all i go off my mid-life crisis tibet . there some fears this may not work `sales ' dealt permanent blow , but i prefer faith all you wunnerful people out there who've stayed bus so far , i'd like think you'd rather see invisibles completed intended than me hack it out meet monthly deadline . " it final book series , you might expect invisible kingdom answer questions end long journey . unfortunately , you would mistaken . fact , most volume 3 doesn't even feel like invisibles we know love . where volume 1 slow-paced focused characterization , volume 2 focused action metaphysics , volume 3 seems like totally different series . main cause this invisibles themselves relegated supporting-character status ; mr. six his division pals archvillain sir miles delacourt instead get most " screen time , " king mob , jack , fanny reduced small parts . make things worse , when morrison feature invisibles , instead using characters we already know , he instead tortures us new invisible named helga , who probably most annoying character series . morrison obviously doesn't think so , however , he gives helga just every " cool " line " outrageous " action he think , attempt make her cutting edge . instead , she comes off annoyingly pretentious bore , it doesn't help morrison fails give her any sort background or emotional makeup . what makes this all more frustrating he uses this character so much , totally ignores more interesting female invisibles ragged robin boy . it like morrison ran out ideas main characters , come up someone new carry plot ; problem , he couldn't chosen worse lead character . said , book 7 picks up mr. six division , last seen book 3 : " entropy uk . " they're still hot trail miles delacourt monstrous " future king " england . meanwhile , mr. six strives help his teammates remember they're actually undercover invisibles agents . addition this , six helga attempt deprogram sir miles . while this going , jack frost africa jolly roger , where he comes closer realizing his buddhahood . king mob mostly out picture , off meditating india , trying rid himself need kill . after laying rest 99 year-old invisible edith , king mob et al reunite final showdown miles delacourt demonic archons he serves . this culminates satanic crowning monstrous king august 11 , 1999 , horrific ceremony which entails butchering children homeless victims . instead action scene volume 2 , events play out more lines mystical denouement volume 1 , jack frost once again proving he most powerful human alive . above two paragraphs make events volume 3 sound rather simplistic . this not case . i mentioned , since this final volume series , one might expect morrison answer questions . instead , he chooses make volume 3 opaque difficult possible . even dialog doesn't help sort things out ; characters don't talk each other , they trade " i'm too cool " banter . what makes this all more grating morrison so obviously taken his themes plots works robert anton wilson terrence mckenna ; but unlike those authors , who always guide reader through their labyrinthine visions , morrison instead tosses everything into blender hopes it all comes out " cool . " therefore , chance any emotional impact pretty much lost . volume 3 saved final story series , " glitterdammerung . " fully illustrated frank quitely , this possibly single best issue invisibles . previous 11 issues volume 3 wrapped up series storyline , but it up " glitterdammerung " explain what series itself all . set 2012 , story operates more metaphysical look back series than linear tale . it tie up several subplots , also ends series defiantly anarchic note , jack frost frees himself confines comic itself . this story alone gives book 7 4-star rating . secret revealed book 7 this ( avoid this paragraph if you hate spoilers , though if you know this , it probably wouldn't " spoil " anything , anyway ! ) : invisibles game , one played someone ( john a'dreams ? jack frost ? you ? ) . toward very end series , several characters begin figure this out , most notably john a'dreams , white-suited former invisible who disappeared before events book 1 : " say you want revolution . " idea invisibles reality-model experienced those who wish gain gnosis ; hence many , many times phrase " remember . it just game " stated throughout books 1-6 . this entails characters realizing they not only works fiction , but each them might even same person , only playing different characters , or " suits , " one enlightened character calls them . i've always felt this morrison skewed way interpreting gnostic " all one " belief , all humans share one collective , unconscious soul - aka " god . " art volume 3 mess . volume 1 invisibles plagued succession artists , some good , some terrible . volume 2 corrected this big way . unfortunately volume 3 goes back volume 1 territory , only it worse . instead different artists handling different story arcs , multiple artists work same story . this terrible idea morrison part , i think it backfired him , art so underwhelming some places dc/vertigo certain pages re-illustrated this collection . book 7 starts off promising enough , philip bond warren pleece cartoonish art , but then it quickly falls pieces when " multiple artist " scenario rears its head . quitely saves day end however , his art " glitterdammerung " just phenomenal his work morrison " flex mentallo . " special mention must also made brian bolland cover art this trade paperback . he " remixed " 12 original covers he volume 3 ; one particular , " sgt pepper " send-up , would make perfect poster . even though this review mostly negative , book 7 still required reading all those who made it this far . morrison finishes series fashion he intended start , character arcs unique inspiring . example , what other work fiction would feature character like king mob , who realizes over course series he degenerating into killer ? bruce willis kill umpteen terrorists " die hard " films not once question if he himself becoming murderous his enemies ; king mob instead gains enlightenment , realizes all life precious . course , if something like this happened mainstream action film , audiences would write it off tree-hugging schlock . but here it works , mostly because morrison aimed something higher invisibles . most time , he succeeded	1

teacher perspective , it hard find " perfect " italian book or audio cd recommend students , because i often run into these two situations : 1 ) book too in-depth too focused grammar ; 2 ) book too superficial more phrase-book travelers , therefore not sufficient . so , what i usually use combination books , including audio cds , this one them . it some useful information culture , well practical expressions brave traveler . however , my recommendation take basic course before traveling italy , because even knowing few simple sentences get you long way . also , group setting you'll able ask specific questions practice others . i'm sure if you check your local community college , there some short continuing education courses foreign languages . non dimenticare ! don't forget : trick learning language repetition , so any audio cd gets you repeat words over over again , great practice . more you repeat , more you'll remember ! it like learning song : you can't sing song you've heard only 1 time , but if you hear it over over , you'll able sing all lyrics !! so , keep up good work ! if you need information traveling italy books learn italian , you also contact me : nada@nadasitaly.co	1

" one thing follows when economists go : occam razor wielded ruthlessly . occam razor principle associated medieval franciscan monk , william ockham , which extols simplicity over complexity : his words , " plurality should not posited without necessity . " this , over time , become important principle distinguishing good less-good science , useful less-useful descriptions reality . acemoglu robinson take this cu t-t he-chaff exhortation heart . few simple sharp answers provided even complex difficult questions heart book : why how democracy arise ? why how democracy take root some places some times , while making only cameo appearances others ? acemoglu robinson daringly reduce determinants democratization three or perhaps four : level inequality society ; structure economy ( i.e. whether it predominantly agrarian or otherwise ); kind assets owned elites ; extent globalization . it remarkable how many historical experiences-in latin america , europe , africa -- explained simple theory put forward authors . example , argentina frequent lurching various forms democracy autocracy follow neatly high levels inequality , which made elites very resistant democratization consequent redistribution wealth away them political change would entail . sure , fit theory historical experience not perfect , authors candid this . some cases book not discuss-india ability maintain democracy face overwhelming odds , example -- traditionally defied easy explanation , even political scientists . there surely cases where non-economic factors such ideology , individuals ( leaders ) , randomness , unintended consequence , significant role determining path political development . example , if sir sewoosagur ramgoolam , mauritius ' first prime minister , responded referendum before independence entrenching majority hindus rather than assuaging minority guaranteeing minimal political participation latter , mauritius might well like archetypal , strife-ridden , ethnically divided african country rather than durable democracy . quibble book structure . while there considerable rewards reading book , patience deft maneuvering through thicket mathematics , required reap them . authors could demarcated more clearly greek english allow mathematically challenged obtain benefits one continuous flow . way , book could more accessible curious generalist addition required reference specialist . but these minor shortcomings ultimately swamped , perhaps even unavoidable consequence , sheer ambitiousness effort : nothing less than provide simple unified explanation democracy . here additional bonus , theory taken data , even falsified . so , skeptics naysayers their go , refute or validate . either way , inquiry furthered stock knowledge enriched . most memorable rendition occam razor due einstein : " everything should made simple possible , but not simpler . " book certainly meets standard .	1

you might define field scientific investigation amount material very smart person process working around 20 hours per week . " process " i mean reading literature doing new experiments , i say 20 hours per week because most scientists spend more than half their time administrative junk . course , days when scientists like . copernicus i . newton their prime , there much less administration much less knowledge , so one scientist could meaningfully contribute multiple fields still time hobbies ( like practicing medicine ) . nowadays scientist might spend his entire career working one small part one small problem , progress so incremental it only noticed his immediate peers . that sign real progress , because it means many big problems long ago solved . but it also means very few scientists luxury looking big picture . so what happens if big picture where all answers ? what if there few laws stretch across disciplines , our modern-day isaac newtons spend all their time working details ? it possible , if it true we would need approach spans fragmented fields science , that what e.o. wilson calls consilience . book very well-written , it provides interesting survey many different aspects science humanities . idea certainly makes sense abstract , although i'm not really sure what author calling practice . i agree it would great if scientists educated more broadly outside their immediate disciplines , but i'm not sure how this without sacrificing some rigor drives science forward . maybe i missed something . wilson often criticized his suggestion methods science used study humanities . some reason this really bothers people , i don't understand why . all he saying scientific method great way understand how things work , there no good reason think music or poetry exceptions . last week there article journal science describing mathematical structure musical chords . author found chord sequences people find attractive occupy clusters non-euclidean geometric space . math allowed him detect patterns music certain composers , even certain styles music . all accounts very exciting discovery , one deepens my appreciation both music mathematics . why anyone would feel threatened this mystery should studied state-of-the-art neuroimaging methods	1

kapuscinski born poland 1930s lived through world war ii . he would go write poland national news service ( their version ap ) foreign correspondent . he covered " little wars , " insurgencies , revolutions , coups barely reported western media . his point view fascinating : man living behind iron curtain serves his country reporting terrifying conflicts most inhospitable parts world . when you read kapuscinski work you may first feel like something missing , then you realize what missing western perspective presumption detachment comes it . kapuscinski , like no other writer i've read , able delve into psyche his subjects produce remarkable insights their nature nature their oppression . which isn't say his writing dry . more often than not , episodes he relates quite harrowing . shah shahs no exception . quite unexpectedly , i found this book shah his overthrow ayatollah khomenei very relevant today conflicts , specifically , difficulties inherent replacing brutal oppressive regime without falling prey extremism . his discussion horrors shah secret police , savak , astonishing , his insight into vulnerability iranians they attempted move decades oppression fascinating . assessing difficulties undoing damage regime like shah , parallels today struggles iraq hard ignore , , such , book especially interesting read this moment history . i one book kapuscinski left read , after , i only hope some benevolent publisher decides put out more his work	1

this fascinating buying guide classical music recordings many positive attributes . it full interesting historical context composers their works fascinating performer trivia , making it quite entertaining educational addition comparing many recording choices . compared penguin or gramophone , it gives much more in-depth backgroung each work history significance . also , there lack any " british bias " ( since published usa ) some cite gramophone or penguin ( both uk published ) . case point : american pianist , garrick ohlsson superb eight volumes chopin arabesque label . third ear only guide extensively review each ohlsson arabesque cd while there not one mention 2003 penguin or gramophone . bias ? perhaps more likely brits just not familiar all musicians " across pond . " its really impossible any one guide " end-all " guide . notable unique feature third ear guide many pages great biographies famous musicians instrument back ( pianists , violinists , violists , cellists , wind players , percussionists , vocalists etc ) . so , here you find legends rubinstein , horowitz , pires , perahia , grumiaux , oistrakh , casels , starker , bain , holliger , graham , pavoratti many other admired musicians/vocalists thoughout past century . addition some curious history career milestones these well-loved performers , third ear guide also cites some their better recordings - real valuable feature i found . however , this guide waxes hot cold depending composer/genre . example , listings available performances huge category like beethoven 32 piano sonatas , there several entire pages covering nearly two dozen musicians who recorded those works compelling insights into their styles , historic performances careers . really great stuff conoisseur ! but , other categories it different story . most frustrating some many cases , obvious top recordings major performers not mentioned , leaving reader incomplete information . but , bottom line no one guide end-all resource , serious collectors this guide gramophone penguin guides each really something valuable often unique contribute study finest recordings . style side , commentary not dry academic but full human interest spicy opinions - revealing " nuggets " fascinating information music you most love . additionally , editors not always prim-and-proper , saying only positive things ( like penguin guide ) but actually give critical insightful comments which truly helps one sort out pack . this respect , third ear guide probably most interesting read compared others . so , this guide much more than just guide look up ratings - it fascinating journey into classical music , its vast repertoire its performers . if you serious collector , multiple guides area always best way go get wide variety opinion . if you really only pick one guide , most people would go legendary penguin guide . but , my second guide would definately third ear ( over gramophone ) it often lists recordings suprisingly not listed penguin . also , it just plain fun fascinating read random	1
admittedly , my education area american history somewhat lacking -- so my review going bit less critical than others , simply lack much compare it . however , i say schlesinger writing style witty , academic yet unprententious , almost lyrical flow it--it not dry reading though subject matter . if you don't know much american history beyond major events or what occurred over past 60 years , you learn things american politics you won't hear discussed any talk show , news program or editorial section newspaper . example , schlesinger points out " unilateralism " favored bush administration nothing new american history -- fact , more internationally involved stance maintained during cold war anomaly . this crucial point almost never brought up debates current events ; most people argue administration standpoint egregious break " american " foreign policy . author personal political viewpoint , i think schlesinger quite honest where he stands ( liberal ) , but i don't think this problem . he frank reader his own beliefs ; i think it better he this than pretend none all , which virtually impossible any historian ( though , obviously , there more or less blatant ways doing so ) . all historical accounts or analyses filtered through author individual lens . i don't think book suffers all because this . there few times focus book seemed bit all over place , but generally i feel i learned lot reading it . i would definitely recommend this anyone who doesn't read lot history normally but who curious nonetheless . schlesinger great writer easy get into -- additionally , text quite short history book , so this also makes it ideal beginner .	1

saying goes : " if you give man fish , you feed him one day . if you teach man fish , you feed him life .

i recently thumbing through overview book philosophy , writers made passing mention how theism viable intellectual option , simply virtue defense theism mounted great christian thinkers . author three examples descartes , reid , plantinga . alvin plantinga philosophical work spanned half century influenced whole philosophical world , among theistic non-theistic thinkers alike . books like god other minds , nature necessity , god , freedom , evil not only stood test time , but their influence continues felt across variety disciplines . analytic theist ( hereafter tat ) , editor james sennett collected most forceful significant his writings . one benefits such anthology it shows development philopher thought over time . here roots movement now known reformed epistemology , plantinga argument belief god no more unjustified than belief other minds his monumental essay , " reason belief god , " where he begins laying groundwork his later work why theistic belief legitimate epistemic warrant . but there more plantinga than epistemology . sennett includes his " free defense " problem evil , his modal version ontological argument god existence , few chapters philosophical theology , even review book new testament criticism . all these selections plantinga trademarks evident : his sharp wit , his use humor , his lucid writing style , most importantly , weighty clear-headedness mark any good analytic philosopher . those unfamiliar analytic philosophy or type meticulous logical argumentation plantinga utilizes , there some chapters seem difficult , if not downright opaque . case any highly specialized academic field , this expected , but general reader - especially general christian reader - should not turned off plantinga rigor . there other selections tat much easier going casual reader but equally important some more technical chapters . only potential complaint i tat it contains no chapters plantinga work area epistemic warrant , either warrant : current debate or warrant proper function , both which published five years prior tat . no study plantinga complete if it ignores his notion warrant , but minor quibble . tat essential reading any christian who endeavors intellectual faith . there something here not only christians academia but every believer . most christian scholars writers - if they worth their weight paper - already familiar plantinga , but it shame many christian leaders teachers seem not discovered his inestimable value . pastors , knuckle down pick up anything alvin plantinga . begin either analytic theist or warranted christian belief . it time move into big leagues .	1

review under mine ridiculous . this person obviously knows nothing tennessee williams . incidentally , i no interest his email address which he egomaniacally implies one should look . characters this play not hysterical ( except shannon once when he goes off deep end , that not hysteria come think it ) . this beautiful , moving , perceptive exceptional play . i won't give away plot case anyone wants read it . williams wrote lots good some great plays . this great one . i came upon this review ( one under it which just inaccurate , reviewer apparently hard time grasping what he reads , if he read it ) because i just saw movie this play want reread it again . i've read it many times , i love it . i think ( though i'm not sure ) bette davis played maxine original production , unlike ava gardner ( who perfect part ) , her " ha ! " ( described stage directions ) explosion , occurred frequently . one scene i give away . shannon tells hannah place where animals go deficate . place so poor people so hungry , people go through dung looking eating bits undigested food . hannah goes behind tree throws up . left out movie . this very kind gentle play . emotionally ( all williams ' plays i've read , he used hero mine , i've outgrown him , except this gem ) intellectually ( not so customary ) deep .

james robert parish " fiasco " interesting read anyone penchant hollywood film history . but it review some worst pictures ever made , he seems repeating himself - pictures fail only when they don't bring requisite amount dollars . everything else secondary whether or not film makes money - not just ( relatively ) small profit . movies make many , many times their cost not failure . pretty high hurdle . ultimately , causes all same : lack studio or producer oversight ; inflated star egos ; unplanned ( costly ) over-time ; bad press reviews . some hollywood truly awful films not reviewed here ( " heaven gate " primary example ) some arguably fair movies ( just not big money makers ) . example , " cleopatra " opening chapter sets stage all follows . you'll get no argument me " cleopatra " trial make . however ( my humble opinion ) final result lush tale fails only last third picture . given , i laugh one contemporary reviewer comment " [ elizabeth taylor ] screeches like ward heeler wife block party " last half film . so true ! mr. parish also refers number vanity films made promote liberal political views actors involved ( " chase " , " wild party " " reds " example ) but never explores possibility audiences go movies entertained - not lectured . i know it currently popular criticize entertainers using their platforms promote their personal political views i'm not trying join band wagon . but it fair suggest movie made primarily criticize traditional american mores ' not going big hit vast majority traditional americans . each chapter begins brief overview state theater going , i.e. , attendance numbers , ticket price , etc . this interesting itself . it also contains some few surprises . example , who knew song dance numbers " ishtar " intentionally bad ?! i just thought natural product fact beatty hoffman , while talented actors , neither singers nor dancers . all-in-all , mr. parish book entertaining read fair accounting some worst films ever made , though he offers little hope studios , talent or corporate owners learned anything way lessons their checkered past . book certainly breath fresh air traditional tinsel town history trumpets silver-screen successes bypasses its flops	1

proust great novel not need read all one time . i read it one volume time usually took six months year off volumes . i always able pick up right where i left off nothing lost , like visiting old friends . i think it ok think remembrance things past series novels . i know proust would disagree this . it very important him his readers consider carefully unifying theme symmetry which he aspired novel , but i think aspect became less less tangible his manuscript grew 1000 pages originally 2000 , then 2000 4000 odd pages it ended up ( he continued expand manuscript right up until time his death ) . any event , grand theme he designed not lost you if you stay novel until end it wonderful when you consider it , but it not reason i love novel so well . swann way , within budding grove , guermantes way decisively best volumes , fortunately , they first three order . if you like swann way but intimidated gargantuan size entire series , then plan read least first three volumes . this way you experienced proust best material . entire novel essentially fictional autobiography or memoir . it narrated man whose name we never given , although he hypothetically suggest name " marcel " himself one occasion three-fourths way through . story inspired events people proust life , but it strictly fiction . swann way only volume which narrator not central figure story . it , ultimately , conventional story several fascinating characters humorous , razor sharp dialogue . there several recurring , ingeniously depicted themes novel , not least which involuntary memory , it often reads like deeply philosophical essay , proust wandering off one his famous digressions . philosophical digressions best part me , but i could see why they could distracting or tedious some . proust sentences quite frequently stretch 10 , 20 , or even 30 lines , multiple subordinating clauses . it dizzying . some claimed this makes him stream-of-consciousness writer . i flat out reject this notion . it never , ever pretentious or unnecessarily wordy . literary historians love bracket proust same category joyce ( like art historians like couple , example , van gough gauguin ) , but two writers different night day . every sentence worth time proust , there no word games , there no obscurity , it all essential rewarding . only complaint i he spends too much time theme jealousy later volumes , theme he covered quite well swann way . those volumes worth reading too , but they tendency drag out way first three volumes don't . things pick up bit final volume , time regained , where everything comes full circle	1

" meat " preparation ( test strategies section ) only 62 pages long , easy enough read . although , there probably too few drills practice , you need take practice test get real sense what questions like . i noticed quite few typos thoughout book , which seems ironic book focused engligh literature . i took practice test #2 , scored 580 ( which isn't great ) , looking over answer explainations , it seemed me like lot questions two or more very legitimate , equally arguable answers . other words , topics questioned too subjective , open interpretation , more so than actual , official , sat subject test , which i just took found easier than practice test this book . but i not recieved my score back yet- so we see . also , book talks tests lot what it calls " roman numeral questions " , question format where you given three choices must choose combination roman numerals answer . it heavily stressed these confusing prevalent ... don't worry , i only encountered one these actual test . overall , i satisfied preparation this book provided , although i think it little too subjective questions it asked , which may frustrate you when taking practice tests . recommended someone who fairly good interpreting literature anyway ( " enlgish " person ) , who wants know what they going tested , especially people who not any specific preparation panicking wednesday before test ( me . ) not recommended someone who not " enlgish " person , or no familiarity literary terms/devices ( case , you probably shouldn't trying this subject test ) , or anyone who wants lot preparation becuase they feel really uneasy taking sat literature subject test .	1

i am actually reviewing both parts one two this since they should read together . reason why i enjoyed these plays so much because we see falstaff both them . he my favourite shakespearean character - big , bawdy , rough , liar cheat , but again we know what he right beginning , shakespeare keeps him so true character . these plays bit different some other histories . there more comedic parts them one thing . plays certainly used medium introducing young hal ( who become king henry ) . we see him young man , watch him grow see influences his society people it his development . he doesn't appear growing up well according his father because he so irresponsible . king henry iv not england strongest ruler . he haunted his guilt over death his predecessor , king richard ii . part two , comedy still plays big role , we still see falstaff influence young hal until shocking moment falstaff death . best part part two though deathbed scene old king henry iv his son prince henry . play leads us " king henry " . prince hal finally grow up he becomes very strong leader . actually king henry iv , parts one two should read before king henry . it correct sequence we see prince hal grow mature .	1

this wonderful recreation shakespeare time place . evocation england , it much superior ackroyd overly diffuse _albion : origins english imagination_ . ackroyd shakespeare actor poet first storyteller second , if all . ackroyd cautions us view theater elizabethans , highly-stylized rhetoric-festooned spectacle , not we now , attempt create naturalistic world miniature . ackroyd also great job portraying shakespeare he must seemed his contemporaries . he all rage while , undeniably talented , fast worker , but also frequent borrower other writers , even using verbatim passages sources his history plays . this he not unique his contemporaries , just moreso . magnitude his achievement would not become fully apparent three-quarters century . shakespeare here very much unseen seer , able take all guises never disclose his own true self . since all we really plays few legal documents , temptation infer shakespeare personality out his writings strong . ackroyd handles this pitfall-dotted terrain masterfully , reader never feels author climbing rainbows . neat surprise oft-parsed biographical material ackroyd assembles record lawsuit which shakespeare called witness . ackroyd points out this only surviving transcript shakespeare actual spoken words . perhaps typically , he noncomittal his testimony . latter fourth book only slightly less fascinating , plays finished biographical trail winds through miscellaneous legal materials contemporary allusions . but whole work great . ackroyd makes great tie-in end shakespeare life lines his last play : let us thankfulfor which , you leave disputethat above our question . let go offand bear us like time	1

poor , poor pere goriot ! this story tragic tale pathetic , old , doting father his martyrdom . goriot spoils his awful , frivilous , vain , ungrateful daughters throughout this book while they ignore manipulate him . daughters so terrible you can't help laughing little goriot pitiful way fawning over them putting them above even his most basic needs . they demand all best life while allowing their father live poverty need . they ask him luxuries when he barely enough survive . his concept paternal duty nothing less than inspirational , even though he pitiful , we can't help loving him admiring him despite his irritating messanic complex . balzac just such fun , rich , witty writer his characters so engrossing . he so adept pointing out self-absorption frivolity so many figures his time , making you feel bad their victims . i think any modern reader would enjoy him much they would-really more-than most contemporary writers . i think there should revival popularity books like these because they're just so much more intriguing than so many present day stories	1

problem pop-tune anthologies song lyrics heard , not read , only their music . especially so irving berlin , who nearly all his work theater films , whom presentation important song . ( picture " pretty girl like melody " without ziegfeld beauties -- impossible . ) fact berlin lines could flat-out flat-footedly corny . " melody mellow/played cello " only provoke giggles those unfamiliar songs , which i fear norm these days ; his worst he downright clueless . ( his proposed jingle unproduced nbc spectacular : " everybody step , /have drink coca-cola -- /it finest pepperola .... " pepsi-cola ? ) but this problem comprehensiveness . there too many " rag " songs " coon " songs " step-step-step " songs , too many singing musical notes dancing edibles , too much high-flown love treacle , too little poetry wit marked golden-age pop songwriting its finest . even most interesting ones like " sadie salome ( go home ) " , fresh their impudent suggestiveness , only hint their marvels . chronological layout inevitably sets up drab finish decades verbal noodling , reclusion despair . yes he wrote catchy tunes early days , but berlin didn't really come into his own until late , his thirties revues , fred-and-ginger scores , " holiday inn " , " this army " , " easter parade " , his one true masterpiece , " annie get your gun .

" mort " fourth book terry pratchett hugely popular discworld series . he gone win carnegie medal " amazing maurice his educated rodents " awarded obe 1998 . death - tall guy , somewhat underfed , big grin , carries scythe - appears more discworld books than any other character . however , " mort " first where his appearance anything other than very brief cameo - though , admittedly , he remains one book support characters . book hero mort , youngest son farming family living ramtops . he doesn't quite look typical hero : although tall overly-helpful , he also red-haired , freckled largely built knees . his family specialises distilling wine reannual grapes - you plant seed this year harvest grape last year . ( wine , you tend get hangover morning before need drink quite lot get over it ) . mort lack talent agricultural field ( boom boom ! ) , however , causing some concern his father . hoping someone hire him apprentice , lezek takes his son hiring fair sheepridge hogswatch night . although mort last one hired , he probably most aptly named apprentice - given his new boss death himself . despite mort initial discomfort position - he doesn't dead himself bones look entirely optional - he decides accept position . death also makes it clear he doesn't killing himself - that up assassins soldiers , example - he just takes over when people die . ( he , however , known murder curry ) . life ( if that what you call it ) death very strange . his home designed , unsurprisingly , varying shades dark much bigger inside than outside . he also daughter called ysabell butler called albert - both human not just skeletons - horse called binky . all also very much alive . problems start when mort starts shadowing his new boss work - specifically , when they due escort king olerv sto-lat into afterlife . king just assassinated his ambitious cousin duke sto-helit . unfortunately , princess keli next duke hitlist mort youthful hormones aren't too happy this . soon mort starts interfering , other questions start coming mind - like where death get daughter why he need apprentice ? despite his profession , death one funniest characters discworld . although it first book give him starring role , it may prove slight advantage read one or two other books .

admirer noel kingsbury prolific work , i initially put off this book . some passages , it reads like manifesto new approach gardening . futher reading , however , i found it stimulating , valuable , full hard-to-find information cutting edge work ornamental gardening , particularly europe . its emphasis design plantings reduced maintenance parks public areas not all off point home gardener - certainly this home gardener . i am 61 , only weekends gardening , weekends often interrupted other life demands , i garden difficult site heavy wet clay lots deer . so any gardening approach holds out way beautiful , sustainable garden , using plants suited existing conditions , i create maintain minimal effort time certainly value . moreover , kingsbury introduces me some exciting names gardening exciting gardens i've not known : work cassian schmidt hermanshoff germany only one example . this book window into world planting design gardening most us no access ( much published literature german ) kingsbury brings it light . i heartily recommend this book . it serious book , gives more more successive readings . if your time limited , you reread sections interest you find more value each time . i'm not sure what part piet oudolf actually played this book , but he certainly preeminent practitioner this style , his apparently loose association kingsbury should continue . they doing exciting work , this book puts their work into larger context gives it theoretical framework	1

let me start saying i thoroughly enjoyed this work . if you haven't read michener before , this great place start . typical michener , he tells story region over course centuries this book . michener selected particular river feeds chesapeake , choptank , his primary locale , but populated it geotypical persons , plantations , towns , rather than any specific actual persons or towns eastern shore chesapeake . grown up maryland , i experienced great deal nostalgia areas he describes . characters he creates believable complex . stories he tells across centuries compelling . i three concerns . first minor -- green-covered paperback word " scow " ( flat-bottomed boat ) replaced word " snow " every instance save one . this makes some odd reading , especially early chapters . second seems petty -- i actually believe there not quite enough information nearly 1000-page novel . he mentions guano trade , which significantly affected eastern shore , only one sentence end book . he doesn't explain some early economies very clearly . ( what salt purchased tortuga ? there no cash available , credit fithian seems unlikely extended there . ) islands other than fictional devon island ( e.g. tighlman island ) suddenly become important end book , referenced " old rivals patamoke . " if they old rivals , why didn't they appear before ? this get cut out book ? my third concern very strange charge levy against michener . anyone who seen musical " south pacific " knows , michener strongly opposed racism . certainly this book there whites , blacks , indians full range character talent . however , book still seems strange racist undertone i can't shake my mind . it comes how michener ties his story together across centuries . every janney feckless ( except one who becomes steed ) . every steed enterprising , although not necessarily industrious . every turlock craven . every cater proud , even if this expressed differently across generations . every paxmore upstanding , even sad-sack pusey paxmore believes he acting upstanding manor until he looks back what he . one steed even refuses acknowledge her own grandchildren because they turlock blood them , praised author doing so . i realize michener using shorthand help reader keep characters straight across centuries , but result rather too " geneticist , " arguing genes determine destiny	1

try imagine you write sketch comedy lines " saturday night live . " you trying come up skit parodying snooty intellectuals . no matter how talented you , you would unable create fictional satire effective real live harold bloom . bloom certainly pretty proud himself here . he gives us his insight into what makes these geniuses so brilliant . it gets laughable times . example , bloom argues dostoyevsky genius typified his tedious portrayal fyodor pavlovitchkaramazov , while he lacks any notable religious or philosophical genius because he anti-semite . yes bloom , anti-semitic really bad , but believe it or not , person some extremely warped ( or even evil ) views still make outstanding contributions our religious philosophical make up . abraham lincoln said some nasty racist stuff during his lifetime , but still laid out idea american civil religion beautifully gettysburg adress . i certainly find way socrates comported himself young boys more than bit disturbing works such plato " charmides , " but hardly detracts his apology . likewise , dostoyevsky fact religious philosophical genius , despite anti-semite . you'd think ivy league professor would demonstrate some understanding fact people need not morally one dimensional . then there bloom treatment " yawhist . " i think there few areas literary criticism better reveal one character than forays into biblical analysis . you're self described radical who loves foist your utopian political opinions everyone you meet . you decide study bible what you know , you discover jesus st. paul really radicals who really wanted stick it roman empire . you're rigid , uptight moralist . you read bible wow ! you find god really all rules regulations , people you resent aren't living up . your primary interest buisness , you read bible you discover jesus best salesman ever lived , really encourages capitalism ( investing talents all ) . you're harold bloom you read torah discover ... surprise ! yawhist pretentious , snooty intellectual who loved irony . even more sexy intriguing , she sophisticated lady royal court . no doubt one who would charmed harold bloom brilliant conversation , sharp insights into her writing . this book wavers bloom painfully self-satisfied , bloom so self-satisfied he hilarious . thankfully , there more latter . i understand some people might want give this book higher marks , because regardless what it says these geniuses , he good taste . really though , stop think arguement . how hard it compile list geniuses would pretty acceptable anyone know ? i'm pretty sure anyone literature classics course catalogs few universities could patch together something comparable simply cutting pasting . all said , bloom writing good , even if ludicrously pretentious . i can't really knock him stating his opinions . ater all , i zero credentials , write reviews amazon .	-1

let face it ... much we'd like linux oft-chosen alternative microsoft windows outside it environments , fact remains you still need geek get everything work " just right " . michael jang written very nice book help both you users you support overcome linux annoyances his book linux annoyances geeks . contents : configuring desktop environment ; configuring user workstations ; optimizing internet applications ; setting up local applications ; installation annoyances ; basic start configuration ; kernel itches other configuration annoyances ; system maintenance ; servicing servers ; user management ; administration tips ; indexin some ways , this feels bit like one o'reilly recipe books . each chapter series " problems " ( this case , annoyances ) dissected resolved based author knowledge advice . writing very person-to-person , problems like " my cd/dvd locked " , my hard drive too slow " , " i can't boot because kernel panic " . you get feeling author talking * * you , not * * you . result , some problems could very intimidating ( like kernel panics ) treated calm rational manner . information also not restricted single distribution . he covers solutions major distros , like debian , suse , fedora , red hat enterprise linux . solutions desktop issues most cases cover both kde gnome . you should able find * something * here relates your particular setup ... like many books try cover range issues or scenarios , your impression book going dictated whether he covered annoyance(s ) bother you most . but even just getting two or three really good answers make book extremely valuable you . overall , i thought this one best troubleshooting linux books i've seen , one should given serious consideration if you regularly work linux	1

master terror , science fiction mystery genre , richard matheson work inspired many classic ( not so classic films ) . why ? because he one best writers working genre never quite good respect it deserved . his best work inspired people like dean koontz , stephen king , dan simmons other current masters terror . matheson shrinking man ( original title way -- incredible part novel what i recall added after movie made)begins simply enough ; scott carey out boat his brother when ship enveloped fine mist gently stings his skin . he wipes it off , goes down below tell his brother marty it thinks nothing it again . until he begins grow smaller each day . this simple beginning we immediately jump carey fighting spider basement his house ( although both novel film begin same way , after introduction matheson novel veers slightly different direction telling us most story flashback . smart choice novel it would bold choice film but universal-international veoted idea ) . marvelous novel deals themes sense self , loss control , ultimately , loss identity carey shrinks smaller smaller , it also marvelous story terror ( elements science fiction thrown well ) . finally back print after long slumber , incredible shrinking man fleshed out number stories ( novel only 200 pages)including " duel " ( basis steven spielberg film same name ) , " nightmare 20,000 feet " (the basis classic " twilight zone " episode featuring william shatner remade director george miller " twilight zone movie " ) , seven other short stories . warning readers order . " duel " " test " both appear 2 other matheson anthlogies published tor books but there also lot other gems books duel nightmare 20,000 feet well . if you enjoyed this book , i'd suggest matheson marvelous novel i am legend ( which , again , fleshed out 10 matheson short stories novel fairly short . novel made into two films neither one which captures novel very well . " last man earth " horrendous " omega man " . it also provided uncredited inspiration george romero " night living dead " trilogy ) . matheson hommage shirley jackson haunting hill house , hell house also good read ( made into movie " legend hell house " featuring roddy mcdowall ) .	1

if you system or network administrator , then you're concerned security . if you're concerned security , then you want copy " linux firewalls " handy . spite its title , " linux firewalls " more than just firewalling . after introductory material firewalls , how packet-filtering firewalls work , suehring ziegler dive into creating firewalls iptables : enabling services , blocking attacks , optimizing firewall rules , etc . they spend decent amount time looking forwarding nat . they demonstrate some possible network setups varying complexity , show how write iptables rules those environments . remaining third book explores other security tools , such tcpdump , snort , aide . kernel " enhancements " selinux grsecurity discussed briefly . if sounds like lot material cover , it . book weighs over 500 pages , but it laid out such it pretty easy get information you need quickly . authors good job presenting such large amount material clear , easy-to-grasp fashion . also , book includes links further resources highlighted boxes text , collected appendix , if you need go into greater depth particular topic . book full useful tips . example , discussion log target , they explain technique extracting iptables messages noise /var/log/messages directing them their own log . this question comes up repeatedly iptables mailing list . trick use " -- log-level " switch configure syslog write items come through specified log-level seperate log . you still get occasional false positive this way , but it sure beats slogging through all noise /var/log/messages . i couple criticisms make book . example , start firewall boot time , authors recommend ieither using " iptables save " function ( red hat ) , or adding line rc . local . problem former " iptables save " , authors point out , not terribly reliable . furthermore , if you're using script generate your firewall rules , then your rules already saved . problem rc . local then firewall start after network up services listening . i prefer write init script use chkconfig utility ( red hat/suse ) bring up firewall rules before network . biggest omission book any information bridge firewalls . bridge very useful putting transparent firewall onto your network . i am surprised there not even mention bridging , or ebtables ( userspace bridge tools ) , since bridging now part standard kernel . iptables also made work bridge module . pointing out this omission may not completely fair criticism : i yet see firewall book covers bridging linux ebtables ( or iptables ) . nonetheless , " linux firewalls " very nice addition my library . this book live either my desk , or any easily-accessed shelf nearby . disclosure : publisher sent me copy this book review .	1

employed where many maps kept , i always make sure i one these around . i picked rand mcnally atlas upon consideration these important features : 1 ) state maps must enough color contrast able make instant distinctions different roads highways , well municipal boundaries ; 2 ) inset maps cities should depict major attractions , buildings monuments , indicate one-way streets downtown area ; 3 ) driving distances , scale miles , clear legend should appear alongside each state map ; 4 ) index counties , cities towns should located separately maps , so give more room state/city maps main pages ; 5 ) inset maps national parks should also included . rand mcnally atlas all these features , plus other bonuses i like : state-by-state auto rules , important phone numbers ; good overall maps u.s. canada , time zones ; even map telephone area codes . my only criticism map mexico should cover two pages instead one , but this not enough reduce top rating	1

this book revealing typical young earth creationism ( yec ) . these people good great zeal defend christian faith . i commend them . but i must say loving way their method unscientific . it misleading untruthful . we cannot defend truth using par t-t ruth . either way , this still lying ! how anyone defend good cause bad tools ? this destroy christian witness gospel . theologian scientist i must refute young earth creationist movement . many christian leaders theologians opposing young earth creationism because their lies . scientist community ( including christian scientists ) rejects kind pseudoscience promoted distributed yec . today , evidence against young earth creationism ( yec ) continues accumulate . this leads inevitably general conclusion against all christianity . i am so grieved when i see atheists laughing kind science propagated yec . christ name hurt . why young earth creationists twist facts lie so much ? well answer simple . they not any evidence science whatsoever ! then , they invent it somehow . this how they it . they say god created universe ( this right ) . using usher genealogy they believe bible says earth young . ( bible not say ) then they say : " we prove what we believe means science ( after all god created science ) " . but science not helping them . then they forced dig around find any flaws science they use abuse . they continue accumulating anything they find make case ( bits pieces unresolved issues , like little discrepancies scientific data so ) . using scientific language ( their degrees science ) they go out their fields expertise continue their propaganda misinterpreting manipulating scientific data , twisting ignoring facts , misquoting various writers , using wrong tools different kinds measurements , etc . this lying . if they find one discrepancy out , lets say one hundred , they choose ignore 99 order stress one fits their theory . this not integrity . you call this science ? doing sound apologetics we need bring unbelieving scientists faith christ . unfortunately this kind yec propaganda doing exactly opposite . one day they held responsible before god . zeal not enough ; you need wisdom too . yec not any ! this sad .	-1

i agree other reviewers this title this re-hash her previously released books . they all pretty much same , quotes famous not so famous thrown around if she some kind scholar . anyone really care quotes her husband , peter ? " ms witherspoon " review , believe me when i say i am one person who doesn't resent ms. stoddard lifestyle all , frankly i could care less what she or not . i just find her somewhat pretentious . you think she would schedule one her " happiness weekends " harlem preach her message " joy " " love " ? i doubt it very seriously because she would never associate " those kinds people " . ms. stoddard sprinkles " higher power " theology through her book but never she once mention god . who her " higher power " anyway ? who she thank many blessings she , believe me she quick tell you them , i.e. - her two homes , her collection paintings , trips abroad , etc . i borrow this library so i am thankful i didn't spend my money it . if you want alot fluff no real substance then this book you . ms. stoddard living glass bubble ( waterford , no doubt ! ) due serious reality check ! hopefully this last book she publishes long , long time .	-1

seeing some these reviews confirms my notion how general public praise crap like " da vinci code " or brain dead housewives weep over terrible " lovely bones " or think pretentious , cliched narratives like " time traveler wife " worth exploring . this 1st cj book i ever read , there i read every one since . his best book oxherding tale , but this comes close second . 1st all , i must respond rather biased nagative reviews claiming " how would ex-slave speak so intellegently kant , etc ... " well , point here " i " used book isn't necessarily rutheford point time , but perhaps years later , or even after his death . " lovely bones " awful book attempts narrator who dull s**t speak after she murdered . one reviewer commenting how certain railroads didn't exist until after civil war probably closest hint yr gonna get show this story told after his death , or much , much later . it while since i read this book , but descriptions poetic rich , it just sad how yet again cliche confirmed : take great book like middle passage , reviews middling good . but take yr average sappy , bathetic oprah pick , housewives rolling floor . if you like real literature , this you . but if what you want crap , then you won't get it	1
