my wife bought this one best buy without me reviewing it 1st . amazingly , i would bought it after reading reviews here . i'm starting wonder who writes these things ... lg employees ? microwave fine - no complaints . toaster , however , unmitigated disaster . i am opinion you should rarely combine appliances - this appliance poster child this thought . toaster browns extremely unevenly inconsistently ( sometimes you should toast same piece bread 5 sometimes high 10 ! ) . more importantly , toaster broke after 31 days ( coincidently best buy return policy ends same time - best buy unacceptable return policy but guy named " ricky " managing store what you expect ? ) . lg picks up phone quickly they honor warranty . problem they can't think outside box . they me get it repaired but i inconveniently drive it out there pick it up - ok ... no problem . one day later ? it breaks again . it extremely poorly built appliance repair people thought they fixed it not . that how bad it . lg not budge - it repaired again ( great option - costs lg money , me more travel time , it won't job ) or rebate . rebate requires me buy lg or goldstar product . huh ? so you create shoddy product rush it marketplace ( they admitted they don't detailed enough repair history because it too new ) then don't stand behind your product . you backend me into lg or goldstar product i would not otherwise bought . how our government allow these atrocious foreign companies business here ? our we so bad manufacturer we can't top this ? their supervisors very hardlined there no getting around this . " you cal korea but they won't change their policy " they said . i never willingly buy lg or goldstar product i highly recommend you same . shame you lg - you could me appliance buyer next 50 years now your name mud me	-1

i bought this make meaty stews rice my dogs . it works while then stops working , or just goes warm . they replaced it three times -- everytime it went out . this seems common cheap rice cookers -- see reviews rival rcs 200 , they all go out within days or weeks ! i guess black decker rival used same chinaman design these useless things . i can't understand why amazon et al still selling these when obviously they not work . companies replace them but all replacements go out immediately . frustration i bought aroma 60-cupper $125 -- after two months also went out . any suggestions 20-cup rice cooker longevity would appreciated	-1

well after reading reviews this vacuum , i decided give it try . i it month now i say i am sorry i bought this behemoth . right out box trying it first time i noticed things i didn't like . i thought i ' give it some time though hoped i could adjust . here what i found : 1 . vacuum very heavy other reviewers stated . 2 . worse than vacuum heavy , darn thing really hard push . even hard smooth surfaces it hard push . i not figured out yet what heck would cause it so much drag . it drag hard surfaces , it must design flaw . 3 . on/off power switch foot operated . not terrible thing but dirt devil decided put darn thing out view hidden accessory carriage . my first time vacuuming i accidentally ran over sock it got caught floor brush . while brush belt smoking i fumbled around damn power switch . i finally reach down press switch hand because i couldn't find it looking down . it must taking me eight ten seconds finally turn thing off . unfortunately , damage . belt snapped . how nice . i really liked . first time out belt snapped . note switch ; there times i repeatedly press switch because it would not lock off . it takes firm steady pressure turn it off . fun part this annoyance you think you it turned off because motor starts winding down soon you let up it motor powers up . couple not able really see darn thing it real challenge . maybe dirt devil thinks we eyes our toes . hey dirt devil here idea . how putting on/off switch push handle . what novel idea . doh ! 4 . vacuum hose detaches really unwieldy . it long plastic handle you hold onto makes it really difficult manipulate hose . main reason hose it too short . it like you fighting hose all time . it gets tiring . 5 . detachable hose really hard re-install it port . you wedge it there really hard get thing seat . 6 . vacuum terrible rugs , any floor height settings . it bunches up rugs starts smoking baby . my old vac not much better but least old one i could lift vac kind drag it over rug it wouldn't get all caught up . i tried same thing dirt devil forget it . it jammed up every time . 7 . vacuum poor getting dirt off hard surface floors . it just moves dirt around or spits it out back . i use hose attachment . 8 . vacuum horrible steps . my old vac i could drag vac across each step whilst vacuum locked upright position . easy deal . dirt devil not work way . when vacuum upright position brush too high off carpet any good . only option disengage lock vacuum back slanted . one little problem . weight vac cause seal base dirt canister open air begins leaking . you don't get good positive suction . so , you play position tilt get proper seal . problem proper position you need so close where vacuum locks into upright position . it often locks so then you try un-lock it while balancing this heavy behemoth . it joke . only half easy way steps if use detachable hose attach power brush . only problem you fighting ill designed hose heavy vacuum , not mention brush attachment only really get surface dirt . if you try putting pressure some deep cleaning brush stops . now pros : 1 . vacuum seem get carpets pretty clean . it good suction it raises carpet fibers right up . it almost makes my carpet look like new , i not see excessive amount carpet fibers dirt canister . some vacuums like just tear up carpets . 2 . rotating brush attachment works pretty good removing cat hair off couches bedding . all all this vacuum very very poorly designed . i may just donate this thing buy something else . i can't imagine fighting this thing every week years come or until motor dies . maybe i'll lucky motor die soon . then i'll just throw darn thing out buy something other than dirt devil . steve	-1

apparently 3rd hierarchy 4 models new s5 series miele vacuum cleaners , features , price , accessories not exactly linear transition lower higher models , nor even across series . many older series models more features higher price than newer ones . they fancy names like capricorn , red velvet , champagne , leading much confusion forcing you compare each one similar buying car . if your browser tabbed browsing ( e.g. , firefox ) , best way figure out which model best you go miele website open tab each model you're interested . flip back forth see what text changes . callisto cheapest no frills model newest series ( newest technology motor ? ) still comes electronically powered brush ( 4th pisces model turbo ) . after 3 months extensive use : pros : agility - 10 � " wide seb217-3 electric powerbrush comes standard , one reasons i chose this model . me , smaller better . while other vacuums advertise large 13 " power brushes cover more area single swipe , i don't much open carpet space . coffee tables , chairs , weight benches , computers , all need vacuuming around under . powerbrush swivels well get around corners . brush duster - most commonly used attachment ( me ) , brush duster also small ( slightly larger diameter than hose ) bristles durable . it angled default , but even this plastic piece swivels straighten out . this not mentioned anywhere ; you just figure this out yourself . low power , i able vacuum places never got vacuumed before , like over spider web computer cables telephone wires . i even vacuumed telephone itself other dust collecting objects my desk . parquet floor brush - initially , i wondered why miele would include this accessory when powerbrush included , but this " wider brush duster " actually better job hard tiled floors than powerbrush . powerbrush seems more designed churn up stuff carpets , but paraquet brush gathers collects dust stuck hard surfaces better . negative side , you might vacuum brush itself unstuck dust , i wondered why they inconvenience horse " genuine horse bristles " . there no permanent storage vacuum cleaner parquet brush , so you figure out how ensure parts don't get separated life ( powerbrush takes precedence ) . cord rewind - mechanical rewind sucked entire length cord every single time , something like 15 15 times ! ( manual says pull out entire length cord before use help dissipate heat . ) cons : price - after all , it just vacuum cleaner . there also seems price fixing newer s5 series , least when i bought this . everywhere i checked ( maybe 10 websites ) , price exactly $799 or $799.95 , only difference no tax and/or free shipping . one website even advertised " lowest price allowed ! " what diamond dealer ? this amway ? release buttons - release buttons attachments hose counterintuitive , part " comes off " rather than part " stays behind " . therefore , you must squeeze button same hand you pulling away . hose extension button particularly confusing . it oval shaped rocker button " rocks " very little . extend stainless steel hose , you remember which side button ( top or bottom ) press . there no distinction which side press , it always matter trial error i yank tug hose while pressing top bottom extension button . stiff no swivel hose - hose rotates top ( handle area ) , but not swivel base where it connects machine . instead disconnecting reconnecting get rid twists , i'd rather pick up powerhead spin it around get out twists . flex hose diameter larger than i'm used , making hose stiffer difficult store same closet where i used store my old vacuum cleaner . considering price , electrical slip ring would nice . bag full indicator - mechanical bag full indicator actually indicator how much vacuum cleaner straining suck . put your hand over end block suction it indicate bag full . right out box short carpet , it indicated bag full high power . i turned power down , it indicated less full sequentially . you read instructions using floor tool tool slightly off floor get accurate reading indicator . even , there caveats fine dust or pet hair fool indicator . extra stuff ? - parquet brush comes attached short plastic extension difficult plug directly into stainless steel hose ( button doesn't easily click into place ) . extension isn't needed connect parquet brush , so you remove it keep track where you put it . this day , i still haven't figured out what extension , other than connect other attachments i might buy future . this yet piece no place store vacuum cleaner i must ensure not get separated life ( parquet brush , " normal " filter cage , replacement bags ) . symbol marking - power symbol markings not obvious all , contrary claims . other than symbols labels " min " " max " , you read instructions figure out what other power symbols mean . least power seems increase sequentially you turn dial clockwise . quite mode #4 6 settings ( 6 highest ) , therefore not actually quietest but intended " normal " operating mode . i think most people consider " max " default mode . optional filter frame - this model comes hepa filter , so you don't need filter frame unless you're going switch " normal " filters , but brand-new right out box frame normal filters came broken cheap plastic handle , apparently due way it shipped handle protruding out cardboard wrapping . you don't even need handle frame function properly , but kind money i paid , nothing should broken out box . vendor i bought it ( best vacuum ) replaced it free . so it worth $800 ? it good job , but only time tell ..	1
what people don't think how hot chocolate works just well coffee coffee mug . i'm not coffee drinker but if this mug brings you great coffee joy you should also pour hot chocolate it . i take point off because after you pour coffee this mug enough times permanent smell left there , which means using this cup anything other than coffee or hot chocolate gross . especially water . who wants take sip water only smell coffee every time you put mug your face ? not me . not smell coffee horrible or anything . it smells good i can't imagine not smelling it every morning when other people my home making some . great mug you should buy .	1

i old beagle who decided her dotage she would bark when ever she didn't get her way , she becoming intolerable , barking all hours night , disturbing everyone around . she extremely fragile , heart condition , i felt shock collar could kill her . i admit i very skeptical this spray collar but i desperate , anyone who owned beagle know they difficult best train . so i tried collar , i am very happy report it works , tallys barking returned its normal level , which infrequent , it happened quickly , within few days , we followed directions box , which very important , good results . i can't promise this work every dog , but it worked well ours , without resorting shocks . i don't think you just hang this collar your dog expect it work , although i ocassionaly tally refresh her training , i feel it very important training outlined instructions , you get results fairly quickly . i am quite satisfied this product	1

i bought bark stop 2 weeks ago . i read several reviews either really good or really bad so i quite skeptical , but my dog ( jack russell terrier ) would bark rays sunlight coming into house , so i desperate . most important thing remember when buying product like this there aren't many things both great easy . when you buy treats dog train him , you simply leave treats out all time . no . because he would never figure out treats reward doing what you wanted him . it same thing bark stop . first thing you should this device put it audible setting then test see what makes bark stop actually go off . i found doors shutting hard , clanging dishes , etc all set it off . so , if device goes off every 5 seconds , dog isn't going think second it going off because he barking . he going assume it uncontrollable sound he live . so after putting device back into ultrasonic sound setting , i decided i would only plug device when dog barking or when he his cage . also , i never leave device plugged when i'm doing dishes slamming doors , or doing loud things . so dog only hears device when he barks . i realize this might slight annoyance walk egg shells order make sure device works , but i would rather than barking dog . way i look it , i wouldn't just randoming throw my dog treats middle his training , so why leave it plugged all time . end , first time i plugged bark stop , i let dog bark it out . he barked 5 minutes ( normally 10-15 ) then stopped . second time i plugged it , he didn't bark more than twice . bark stop puts out ultrasonic beep when you plug it , so i think now he knows when he going hear more than he wants . i think dog now gotten more used it , try out bark it , but most part , he doesn't bark much all while it , if he barks all . one thing manual say if dog trying protect house , usually this device won't help , which i think good thing . cons : when i testing microphone ( used taking bark loudness ) device , it didn't seem matter if microphone high or low . also , this device would so much more useful if it came remote turn or off , not manage each bark , but simply able sit couch click it , or click it off	1

i originally bought this knife because one chefs restaurant i work one . i picked it up one day lightness balance blew my mind . couple weeks later i bought my own well ceramic water sharpener . i no idea what other guy must doing his knife but my blade sharpens very easily stays sharp months long you don't abuse it . far my favorite knife i used . one warning though : if you going large amount chopping ( like say you're prep cook or you make thanksgiving-like dinners twice month ) then angled shape back blade may rub side your knife-hand index finger wrong way . i cook fairly elaborate meals almost everyday only irritated shape few times under heavy chopping regimes but it something consider . overall i couldn't love this knife more . it most important kitchen tool i ever owned	1

i entire set swiss diamond addition this pan . i bought swiss diamond because , due weak wrists , i needed sturdy cookware not heavy stainless steel . because aluminum primary , affordable , lighter-weight alternative , one not want food coming contact aluminum because possible leaching it into food , i sought non-stick pans coating would not flake or scratch off end up my food . after much research , i discovered swiss diamond . i not disappointed . pans great weight -- hefty without too heavy , after several months use , coating holding up beautifully . i confess i not primarily use metal utensils it , however , so i can't testify how they hold up against metal . these pans caramelize food beautifully , evenness heat distribution them pure joy . they take few extra seconds heat up , but hold heat very well . i really love how flat pan bottom , imagine if you flush electric cooktop , these would especially appreciated . though i gas range , i trouble past pots pans slipping sliding enameled grates , but these pans not slide . i delighted discover , after realizing i accidentally left this pan low heat hour no food it , it not warp all still perfect condition . this cookware cleans up easily perfectly , too . i love they coated outside walls pans so any dried or cooked food comes off outside easily inside . one thing note if you looking pan cook eggs without oil , this may not your best choice . texture diamond coating seems grab more than slick teflon pan would , first time i tried flip my fried eggs without spatula , i less than stellar results . but sufficient oil , i flip eggs without spatula or problem ( i need make my daily quota coconut oil anyway health reasons , so i'm fine putting oil pan ) . if you use spatula , you should easily able flip eggs without oil . i hope these pans turn out durable over years . so far , after few months , they aces ! fact , my husband may growing weary my exclaiming , " i love this cookware ! " over over again .	1

there aren't any wine glasses out there i prefer over riedel vinum series ( except sommelier course ) . i one observation though , this why i didn't give this glass 5 star rating : vinums i've purchased past 5 months don't seem up same quality standards vinums i purchased year ago . quot ; olderquot ; vinum , which logo etched base , better/cleaner cut rim bowl seems thinner - making entire glass look , feel sound more elegant . quot ; newquot ; vinum , which logo quot ; riedelquot ; name etched base , lip which looks slightly rounded side-by-side comparison quot ; olderquot ; glass bowl/glass itself seems thicker . maybe riedel made some changes improve durability , but i like my old riedels better . all all , i said beginning this review , there nothing better out there than riedel vinum series ( long you don't pay full retail ) ...	1

" statement not make any sense . i am going attempt get this matter resolved through amazon . if they can't help i out one hundred dollars . their product overpriced but i thought if it worked , it would worth money . what wrong this world . most people just care all mightly dollar . i make sure when i order kitchenware or appliance again it not kitchen kraft doing business bethany housewares again !!!!!! boiling arizona !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
i decided " upgrade " spend more toaster , too . first one not work properly - one wires holds toast didn't move lever toast tilted one side burned . my second one - wires work but it not toast evenly all ! half time portions burned , even lower setting 3-4 . i don't see it whole lot faster , either . i've gone through half/loaf bread testing it i am not happy . i appreciate reviews amazon checked here see comments this product . it looks like two good reviews year ago , so perhaps manufacturing gotten sloppy . but my old , cheap , unattractive toaster better job than this ! i exchange it again or forget it ?	-1

when i remember use it , this splatter screen makes light work cleaning off stove . it great . screen very fine larger size one covers our farberware skillet perfectly . you also use it smaller things . it lets air out keeps grease . it washes quickly easily . grease doesn't cling it all . only drawback : handle seems flimsy . but people rave lodge products so i guess it'll fine . i just won't abuse it any way . we found good storage place it . buy it not only because its basic design quality , but also because it least expensive all ones i looked	1

i agree previous reviewer : this sharpest , most well made chinese chef knife out there . however , i guarantee you won't find this knife any authentic chinese kitchen because this knife just too expensive . if you want get good chinese chef knife , you should buy high-carbon stainless dexter-russell cleaver ( costs around $40 ) . it only slighly less sharp but difference not noticeable , especially if you chopping rather than slicing . there nothing wrong shun knife ; it just way too overpriced . it just knife , no mass-produced kitchen knife worth $170 , no matter how sharp it	1

after shopping carefully online off , i bought this item jc penney march 25 , 2006 . penney stated regular price $69.99 , sale price $49.99 , same price amazon currently charging . it replaces 10-year old black decker , primarily because i read several reviews suggesting dramatic drop quality bd small kitchen appliances hamilton beach performing well . i also several other hamilton beach small appliances all them function well what they designed . this seemed my best choice reasonably priced toaster oven , since i am not looking cheap convection oven , just acceptable toaster large enough baking potato now then or some other small item too large or wrong shape slot-style toaster . shopping i found no current toaster ovens lever press toasting - all now some variation twist dial this purpose . it ( so far ) performing acceptably oven , though top gets very hot . however , only first few uses produced acceptable toast even darkest toast setting . toast set dark got lighter lighter now , only three weeks after purchase , it no longer toasts all . it not darken beyond palest coloring toasting second time leaves bread only drier , not all darker . top elements not seem heat properly not reach red color needed toast bread ... or presumably broil anything , though i haven't ( won't ) use it broiler . hot top gets regular oven use , i am not confident it would safe broiler , even if upper heating elements working . three weeks post-purchase i no toasting capability all . i fully expect rest oven cease functioning soon , regardless , it no practical use me toaster , which small appliance i want need . i am returning it store starting search toaster oven over again scratch .	-1

this solid coffee machine . it makes great froth . unlike previous reviwer , i no problems froth attachment . trick make sure it assembled correctly froth correctly . make froth , keep turbo frother up close surface . you actually see frother suck milk hear hissing . heat up milk without making much froth , make sure frother below surface so you no longer making froth but heating milk instead . machine quality parts , big water tank , powerful pump , separate controls steaming making coffee , cup warmer ( which you probably don't need because there more efficient ways hear cups ) . it easy clean . i would only recommend getting decent coffee grinder , obviosuly one allows you adjust how fine you grind beans	1
these essentially bowls professional quality riedel vinum glasses produced without stems . doing without stems you get glass neatly fits dishwasher , save $10 per glass compared stemmed riedel . i using reidel o series several years they fabulous . since they genuine crystal opposed glass , they develop bouquet much better ( due microscopic " pores " regular glass lacks ) . they really gleam , right out dishwasher . best all , rims thin smooth , which luxury feel premium glassware all . if you wondering which buy " all purpose " red glass , i prefer syrah/shiraz glass over cabernet/merlot or pinot noir/nebbiolo , even though i drink mostly cabernet . syrah glass just bit taller more graceful than cabernet or pinot noir glasses brings out flavors aromas all red varietals quite well . but honestly , since all glasses well made , differences pretty minor if you like one shape more than , it fine . i wine " nut " over 20 years , these glasses teriffic . buy them , feel safe using them daily . they improve enjoyment every wine you drink , gallo lafite	1

i my rocky doserless grinder nearly nine months i never regretted purchase . this one premier prosumer grade coffee grinders delivers consistent quality espresso through drip ( almost ) up press pot . it solid , relatively quiet - i use mine my office small university close my door muffle noise little more - great option grinding each individual shot espresso . plus , its compact form factor mechanical-cool look mean rocky sit corner my desk , next gaggia factory lever machine it serves . highlights rocky its solidity quality , its ease adjustment , case this doserless model , its ability grind each dose espresso or brew minimal holdover grounds . because path burrs chute so short unobstructed , i rap side when i am dislodge any leftover grounds , or simply remove two screws holding chute use brush clear it . metal hoop below perfect holding gaggia or pavoni portafilter when grinding , removed one quick tug allow you grind into filter , press pot , or bag . rocky weight keeps it steady - it no flimsy lightweight - i personally like power switch grind switch separated doserless model . grind switch front convenien t.t he only things keeping rocky getting five stars grind settings . coarse end adjustment , rocky just doesn't quite make it real french press grind . this issue noted coffeegeek reviews which i didn't care when i bought machine , but which i now wish i considered . also , this niggling point , grind adjustments stepped , not stepless . perfect world , i like think all grinders should stepless like mazzer mini i occasionally get play . said , steps close enough i not found problem getting grind i desire , system release button collar adjusts burrs slick simple . if you market top end consumer coffee grinder , take good long look doserless rocky . when mazzer mini would overkill ( overpriced ) , but you want something closer commercial grade than solis maestro , rocky hits sweet spot	1

bonjour coffee press mentioned magazine ( maybe esquire ? ) top pick after little more research , we purchased 8-cup version . we ( our dinner guests ) loved it so much , we decided get 12-cup version . here why we like it : 1 ) container looks really nice table . we get lots compliments it . 2 ) we've it over 3 years now , use it daily , haven't single problem . i've read glass shattering or burning yourself w/other models , but we've fine . we often put it top rack our dishwasher normal dishwashing cycle , too . 3 ) it fairly easy clean , all parts unscrew if you want give it thorough washing . 4 ) probably all french presses , we feel like we get more flavor per scoop coffee . delicious coffee !! here some tips : 1 ) we grind our coffee store " french press " setting so it coarser . we measure coffee scoops , but not really water anymore since you get used just looking color mixture or how far you normally fill it . we use wooden spoon ( wooden chopsticks bbq skewers also work well ) stir grinds/water mixture - this helps prevent glass breaking if you accidentally hit glass . 2 ) i'd recommend getting this larger 12-cup version . mentioned product description it comes out 4-5 mugs coffee - this because " cups " they refer really teacup sized . this true all brands when they say " 12-cup , " not just bonjour . larger size gives you flexibility make little or lot depending your needs . 3 ) you also use this steeping tea . handy loose leaf teas aren't bags since you just press it down end	1

" i . i bought one amazon it here two days . we couldn't happier . ------------------------------------------------------------ some hints keep coffee hottest : fill airpot water just under boiling temp preheat while you brewing . get pyrex microwaveable 2 qt . measuring cup . microwave your coffee just under boiling pour into pre-heated airpot . this keep your coffee steaming all night . not heat your coffee pan stove . you'll get bitter burnt taste . microwaving glass doesn't disadvantage . --------------------------------------------------------- we use airpot because hot plates coffee brewers not allowed our workspaces . airpot perfect solution . don't buy inferior airpot company . most only rated 4 hours . this lasts all nigh t.t he 2 litre container holds 18 cups coffee . i may get bigger airpot because good coffee goes fast . ---------------------------------------------------------- coffee : picky your coffee . longer coffee sits any container gives it time get bitter . avoid any coffee hint bitterness . it only tend get more bitter . i've tried several brands discarded many bitterness . don francisco columbian good medium price . stater brothers columbian pretty popular , many specialty arabicas taste pretty clean . listen your co-workers comments thecoffee you brewed particular day . make note . ------------------------------------------------------------ warning : airpot leak if tipped . it not leakproof . whentransporting car , make sure airpot well blocked-in prevent tipping . keep it upright	1
no stars what this should . where i start ??? machine brews coffee everywhere but into caraffe . you coffee grinds water all over your counter if you don't position caraffe exact spot it needs ( so forget setting timer a.m. or you needing your mop ) . so called thermal caraffe junk . plan refill 15 minutes after your first cup ? you'll nuke it thermal caraffe not keep coffee warm all . you know those little holes coffee pours into during brewing ... i think it lets heat out well . this worst coffee machine i ever owned it most expensive one i ever owned . i'm going back nine ninety nine specials . least they work	-1

this slicer seems easy enough easy clean . hard part you press blade over food sliced . potatoes most foods used this tool oval shaped not stand up end without slicing them . once you gotten slicer over food , you press it through slicer sections manually . it better idea get box style cutter same cost which easier use , shaped press push food through blades dishwasher safe too ! i wish i not found this item first	-1
i've mine two years now absolutely love it . i primarily use it my protein drinks morning , it traveled all over u.s. canada me . only drawbacks beginning ( 1 ) others mentioned , it large took some getting used compared my old corded hand blender , ( 2 ) instructions side (' press button attach/detach ' ) misleading ; it not necessary press button connect pieces , first one i felt like connections got stripped when i tried so . fortunately , retailer permitted exchange replacement . attach segments , simply push them together it work fine . you need press button separate segments , it tricky pop out plug recharge it without breaking nail first , but once you get hang it this wonderful appliance	1

when i received this item i immediatley knew something would wrong . box it packaged delivered open torn up . not open like someone opened it i mean it sent box no bottom no side , just taped together styrofoam . i opened it thought well it maybe ok , this big item send . right front wheel off balance rest so whole machine wobbles , back panel puncture marks it off level rest machine . i thought jeez what i bought . so i thought well i hook it up use it , see how it . it ran beautifully cleaned my dishes cleaner than i ever seen them . point i thought well damage back wheel doesn not cause it wobble while it running so i just grateful i finally dishwasher . i unhooking it sink ball bearings hold connector piece place fell out down my sink . so i spent 2 days trying call company get replacement piece or something . nothing no answer all .... even during times they say they office there still no answer . so i searched online stores this piece . nowhere !!! danby not even registered sears or maytag ar any big dishwasher supplier matter . hell all actual plumbing repair stores not piece i needed . i told over over again , no one really uses hook up anymore ma'am , or " wow what ancient piece " . so i went online order $90.00 hose hook up ge . once it came i realized it not compatble this danby dishwasher . so i spent week trying call danby still no answer . finally my husband cut tubes dishwasher used hose clamps metal nipples piece dishwasher hoses new ge hookup together . i go out buy new adapter my sink danby one not work ge . but now dishwasher works it still cleans beautifully . ge hookup made little plastic nudules cannot fall out instead ball bearings which if you not careful fall down your sink . so i would liked give this product 1 or even 0 based customer service ( none ) way item packaged way it arrived so damaged , but dishwasher slean so very well . you dont even rinse plates before you put them they still come out sparkly . so all all i would never ever buy them again . if you add up cost dishwasher shipping , plus all money it took repair it , i could gotten much higher quality dishwasher no problems all less than what this dishwasher cost me end .	-1

i little sceptical buying non-stick , i am previous stainless steel user , but i really like hard anodized non-stick surface . it so much better than other non-stick cookware i've used/seen . it durable very easy clean . i cook electric stove , this set heats up so well evenly , i don't really miss gas stove , use lower temperature because way they transfer heat . i also love i need little no butter or oil cook , usually just use them flavor now . i wish lids saucepans fit omlette/frying pans . i've only set little over month , not used them oven , but so far i am very satisfied product	1
cookset wonderful . i've seen cooksets like this more money . calphalon set makes cooking much more fun . working quality cookware makes great tasting food .	1

wish i heeded advice most reviewers before i purchased this . i went ahead purchased this because it replacing braun coffee maker we 10 - 15 years . after it got new plastic taste out it , it made good coffee . even without brita filter . just like all reviewers indicated , carafe leaked spilled badly unless you poured very slowly carefully . unfortunately , it quit working after only 2 1/2 months . seller , etronics , declining anything it saying it now outside their 30 return period . last thing i buy through them . like uhh , since they sell braun , one would think they would some recourse through braun try help their customers . so , here i am proverbial rock hard place , try find braun warranty center wait it get repaired or replaced , or just bite bullet go buy . ( want bet it won't braun ? ) additionally , what we coffee mean time ? such hazards purchasing electric appliance internet	-1

i wanted more comfortable bed so i purchased this comforter . i've found i sleep alot longer than before . getting out bed difficult . if you're looking moderately affordable down comforter high quality , this item suit you just fine . i met girl really comfortable bed . it made my own bed really unimpressive so i bought this comforter . made huge difference . i notice edges comforter more down fill than center . it seemed little odd but while sleeping its hard notice . i think how these made . you price other comforters , some cost $500-$4000 . less than $200 this comforter terrific value . high quality , 15 year warranty . recommendable . sure get duvet cover . my pit bull now sleeps floor ! i used coupon code hohosave it covered shipping tax .	1
this peeler very heavy duty , extremely sharp . i've used it almost daily 4 months now , put it dishwasher every day . it stays sharp peels quickly . i never used straight style peeler ; i like curved one horizontal blade , so i skeptical this one , but hooked first time i tried it . kitchenaid variety colors added bonus . i highly recommend this peeler	1

i bought this item based various reviews here other sites . usually , when majority reviews lean one way , i find they tend correct . this time ? wrong wrong wrong !!! this veggie cutter cheap piece cr*p ! it may ok if all you want cut soft veggies , but if you want cut potatoes french fries , dont bother unless you want blow $20 plus shipping . mine lasted less than 2 months before it fell apart . complete waste my money . i high hopes based upon reviews i read this product , but i lead down ( potato ) garden path . cutting potatoes ( main reason i bought this ) quite chore . i place it floor towel get really good leverage enable me cut my potatoes . main product plastic working parts less than sturdy steel rods . i am really disappointed this product . if you planning cutting potatoes or other hard veggies , then please not waste your money . many people rated this item very high their reviews . i really cant believe these people cut potatoes this . this product just not sturdy enough job !! i write this review hopes i save others throwing their money away searching good french fry cutter . if you choose ignore my warning it breaks you ( which it ... sooner or later ... probably sooner ) , yes , me you hear saying " i told you so " . caveat emptor !	-1

like previous reviewer , we've also gone through several rake-type automatic cat litter boxes ( all litter maid brand ; 2 lm700 , 1 lme9000 ) two which failed after one year , third simply worked so poorly we couldn't wait get rid it . we'd spent enough those three buy litter robot some change left over . spending so much automatic litter box may seem silly some folks , but my wife i travel lot work can't half-dozen litter boxes laying our two cats , nor we wish spend time cleaning all them after we get home . so anyway , machine ... litter robot big ! i'd read measurements , but when i pulled it out box i still surprised ! make sure you've got room it . my first impression it after size it heft . this thing sturdy , nothing cheap it . all interior parts heavy well assembled rivets or screws , well shell . next thing i noticed simplicity . no complicated moving parts like some boxes rakes , lids , etc ... ; motor turns ball , that all you see , drive gear hidden below ball . item assembled flash : put ball base , line up gear , plug power , turn . that it . i filled it standard scoopable/clumping kitty litter . only error i made i overfilled it little it dumped some litter floor when i test cycled it . no problem , clean up mess take few scoops litter out . overall impression device it good quality should provide good service years . my only faint potential misgivings motor , circuitry rubber liner . if any these fail , i hope company still around get replacement parts . i also note no large benefit litter catcher step other than catching some my overfill . when our cats finished box they launched out door land floor , they still scatter litter . oh well , nothing new there compared regular box . cats . we switched boxes them cold turkey . our cats aren't very skittish but they don't take quickly new large devices smell funny make odd noises . they spent lot time sniffing it checking it out , but they refused use it . they held out 24 hours they couldn't stand it any more ; we observed cat equivalent crossed legs jumping up down few hours before they hopped ( meowing , walking up box looking inside , walking away , pacing , repeat ... ) , but soon one hopped used it , other couldn't wait stood door jumped soon other left . problem solved , they now litter robot converts . overall , so far we very happy it . we got over " sticker shock " size , cats got used it less than day . litter robot works exactly it supposed , we hope years serivce it . much better quality device than any rake-type litter boxes we . it leaves no bits floating litter after cycle , needs no hand cleaning after few days like rake-type boxes . we'd recommend this box . now i just resist painting it look like eva vehicles " 2001 : space odyssey " ; " open pod bay doors , please , hal ... open pod bay doors , please , hal ...	1

i bought this popular online auction $25 , but i didn't know what i getting into . buy this only if you accept following : good : other writer reported , suction unit superior , esp compared uprights hose attachments . cord pullout retract again , superior . better than my electrolux ... bad : hose extension wands proprietory , , don't expect use your old crevise brush attachments all superior suction . you can't attach crevice tool end one wands . you need attach crevice tool order put brush . gimicky . furthermore , wands fly apart unless you jam them hard . unit lacks beater-bar . don't expect this any value carpeting . on/off switch small could positioned better . no turning this guy on/off your foo t.t he bagless design old-school . it uses same permanent coffee filter design that around years years , you see it clog up no time . superior suction compensate , but you'd think after dyson solved problem one way , others would soon follow . not case here . but real bug release dirt compartment part handle . real careful picking this guy up or dirt go flying all over ( down stairs ! ) . who would think someone would pick thing up handle ? however , i should say suction very good if you don't need carpet cleaning , never want use your own cleaning attachments use it under limited circumstances , it not bad deal price . i use it cleaning out computers . all all , however , except those limited circumstances , very soon after buying this you'd realize you should paid little more gotten something you use long term .	-1

i bought this ( black ) williams sonoma over $100 - thought i'd spend extra $ thinking i getting quality item would last . . . boy i wrong , wrong , wrong ! my cheap mr. coffee lasted longer than this thing ! day 1 - plastic smelled sooo bad it turned taste my coffee into cupful plastic , chemical waste - after cleaning/ running vinegar through last 4 - 5xthroughout - it nothing but leak , flooding my kitchen counter every time i wanted cup coffee - less then six months later leaking got so bad it ready garbage . one last attempt before deep sixin ' it - figured maybe seal water measure just need jiggle . . . w/ hardly any pressure - thing jiggled right off coffee maker into my hand b/c plastic so brittle . coffee also doesn't get all hot cools very quickly - even ' thermal carafe ' which perfect if you like lukewarm coffee turns ice cold after adding cream2 stars looks alonemay better off/cheaper buying couple disposable $40 coffee makers , replacing them every 6 mo	-1
i wanted love this toaster , i really , i read all reviews convinced this would great working , long lasting toaster . i bit bullet , spent way more money than i wanted , ordered this toaster . i like way it looks i like it doesn't ' pop-up ' , you check toast anytime you want return it toasting cool lever . however , i wish i returned it . it slow , it pain plug before each use ( must unplugged when not used ) , worse all : it not toast evenly ! top burnt , bottom not even toasted all , or one slice perfect other slice like it never put into toaster . this toaster would waste money $9.99 , it should illegal charge $200 . it . said , amazon price 200 . better deal than william sanoma 299 ., but i am still sooooo disappointed this purchase . upon re-reading other reviews i find people purchased ' refurbished ' models seem more pleased their purchase . leads me wonder if upon ' refurbishing ' they making them better somehow	-1
this pot easy use , convenient , compact , good looking great investment	1
braun aroma deluxe kf550 very good small appliance company generally associated better than average quality . not all braun products exemplary , but majority them easily better than competition price reflects higher level quality . this coffee maker braun looks nice stylish ; offers some extra bells whistles my most coffee maker don't ; carries braun name- brand name i grown know trust . i like added features braun aroma deluxe kf550 offers , like permanent filter , pause serve feature , brita water filter . each these items helps make process simpler smoother than before added feature brita filter not only helps brew better tasting coffee , it also helps keep coffee maker clean . purified water means less calcification means less cleaning vinegar or other decalcifying agents . i really like permanent coffee filter but there one drawback i noticed : tendency coffee granules get into pot brewed coffee . permanent filter nice but depending how finely ground coffee , it cause problems . example , if coffee ground very fine , like powder , it may end up seeping through permanent filter dripping into coffee pot , leaving murky mess bottom each cup coffee . other potential problem overflow . depending size grinds , they clog permanent filter cause basket overflow , transferring grounds coffee into your cup making small mess kitchen counter . one thing braun aroma deluxe kf550 doesn't offer ability program . this could deal breaker many consumers it little surprising braun doesn't include this its list features . it offers just everything else you could want coffee maker but there no ability program no clock . personally , i no use feature like this why i decided exclude it my list requirements when i went shopping coffee maker . its price , this coffee maker more expensive than most but i think price fair , even if it doesn't include programming . overall , i am happy my braun aroma deluxe kf550 . it brews tasty cup coffee without any fuss it offers ability stop brewing cycle order pour quick cup well security knowing coffee maker automatically shut off two hours . i few question marks this device- durability questions only answered due time . but i like what i seen thus far i recommend this appliance anyone who wants better cup coffee .	1

i bought this knife january 2005 , after lusting one beautiful shun knives long time . i little concerned d-shaped profile handle , because i'm left-handed , but not any problem it . edges rounded difference flat side rounded one not intrusive sensation . said , i'm not convinced there any significant advantage this shape , either . i selected tomato knife because it seemed like it would fill unoccupied niche our rather large collection kitchen knives . this versatile knife shouldn't limited its name - not only it handle ripest tomatoes well , but it handy cutting other soft , juicy fruits vegetables or any other use which serrated blade needed , size blade makes it excellent utility knife . my husband i use it regularly , we both love it .	1

i reviewed most juicers ... many other major sites decided kitchenaid best product market . after receiving it , i changed my mind . although it promises easy cleanup " special tool " , it way too hard clean up . pulp basket contains ridge makes it next impossible get out all little strains pulp . special tool great getting out big stuff , but not little stuff . also , there ton juice left over pulp gets thrown away . this result poor design , which filters juice through pulp before exiting . product nice design looked good my counter-top , but it not deliver . i would recommend buying jack lalanne power juicer available other sites	-1
i've gone through three cutters borrowed one try out last few months . zyliss palm-held model ingeniously designed so-so use , but not really intuitive enough use readily or well ( i've professional hand tool user variety trades past 40 years ) . i tried out kitchenaid model smaller blade it nice heavy but unimpressive use . i suppose kitchenaid 4 " model might worked well , but it some negative features i discovered during my research . hanging hole set perpendicular blade - not good idea hanging against wall . handle metal plastic smooth ( not conducive maximum grip friction ) not shaped well good torque control . pistol grip nice , but doesn't really add control operator . lastly , axle bolt nut apparently isn't completely stainless eventually needs tightening because locknut nylon affected machine-washing temps . i'm not surprised mario batali stainless 4 " pizza cutter put out copco - i've coated , cast iron frying pan copco since early 1970 it exactly same condition when purchased - solid , beautiful , functional joy use own . this pizza cutter same attributes . it really well designed ergonomically , esthetically functionally . axle permanently riveted ( no bolt nut eventually go loose or rust after machine washing ) what appears single-piece axle/rivet , surrounded either side what appears neoprene washers . wheel riveted precisely enough there no slop whatsoever , yet wheel rotates perfectly during use no discernable friction . oval handle , covered typical soft grip we see nowadays contemporary tools , gives great amount control through grip friction torque . fit finish this tool beautiful , no discernable manufacturing flaws . use , it cuts like gangbusters - one quick slice through you're . no need back-and-forth get job ( i bake thick-style pizza ) . this thing really heavy substantial hand . much , * much * better than anything i've used before . obviously designed someone who knows what they're doing . price ($15 when i bought it ) ridiculously low , considering workmanship quality . i'd recommend this pizza cutter anyone serious their pizza . thank you , mario batali ( one my favorite food network chefs )	1

i really like look these square dishes . switching stoneware corelle good decision . they take up much less space my kitchen it easier carry whole stack them my arthritic hands . because their smaller size , we use lunch plates more often than dinner plates . but we miss smaller bread butter plates , so i ordered some plain white round 6 3/4 inch plates . disappointed we couldn't get small square plates , but round ones ok . 22 oz . bowls larger than most . slight lip rim helps remove them microwave without getting burned . corelle doesn't heat up like stoneware . also disappointed mugs not corelle glass , but porcelain . they feel nice your hand but could tip easier than most mugs . overall i really like these dishes would buy them again	1

my 30 year old ge blender/food processor combo broke blade blender part i could not get part so i toss blender container , leaving it stand-alone food processor . after debating buying countertop appliance , which probably would not durable something made 30 years ago , i decided give this blender try . i've always liked kitchenaid products , this one no acception . i surprised power this blender ! best part me it easy clean takes up so little kitchen real estate . making soups hummus breeze . whisking up egg whites so much less painful than dragging out mixmaster ... just give yourself big enough bowl or they all over kitchen . small food processing container just right size 1 or 2 people . variable speed lets me control how coarse my chopping too . i find turning entire apparatus upside down sideways or shaking it helped chopping everything uniformly ... but it only took couple seconds . i would given this blender solid 5 stars , but making smoothies ice not perfect , although once i got technique down ( moving blender up down around lot " attack " ice ) it ok . it took more than few seconds . if you drink lot ice blended drinks or smoothies , this job more efficiently good conventional blender . if you only use it occasionally this purpose , kitchenaid fine . maybe kitchenaid could come up special blade or container/blade combo ice blending , i'm sure lot people would buy it , i know i would . all all , i don't regret my purchase all . it versatile compact appliance me years come	1

i knew upfront other reviews when you first start delonghi radiator they bit oil smell . so when my radiators ( i bought two ) arrived , i put them open place , turned them max , let them burn off factory oil smell . smell gone two hours i brought them inside . they work great best all , they quiet , quiet , quiet ( only small click when thermostat turns off ) . i use them two rooms . one room 10x10 8 foot ceiling which i use home office . it heats room very quickly . other delonghi room 10x12 very tall gable ceiling ( 12 foot peak ) . initially i thought all heat would just accumulate peak , but it didn't . delonghi radiator fins moved enough warm keep whole place warm . these radiators small easy move around . i don't use thermostat because they heat sufficiently fast i don't need bother program mode . one thing i like these radiators they don't dry air way electric heaters ( i one it always smell burned dust air very dry afterwards ) . any radiator , please make sure you fresh ventilation room .	1
i just bought this model it far away best value i seen . i using juiceman 410 6 months , centrifugal model , i wanted try one masticating/auger types . z-star manual juicer single auger juicer without motor , cranking handle breeze . i performed test it my juiceman , where i juiced apple , lemon , kiwi , 4 strawberries , 1/8 honeydew , all unpeeled , each machine , z-star produced more juice . juiceman juice smoother whipped texture , but z-star made more all pulp bone dry . my opinion , there no reason buy motorized single auger juicer long they make this one .	1

my sister previous model didn't work well . her all stainless salt not mill , it shaker . she hates it because salt saker filled bottom flimsy plastic cap that not good anymore . i like this one much more because it actual mill . careful which one these models you buy . there three kinds ; one adjusts grind twisting knob top , which isn't very good because it loosens shifts grinds ; other adjusts two settings only fine corse , which doesn't work well me either ; then there maybe five or six adjustable settings i think really best one bunch . i really like way salt comes out fine snow-like flakes rather then chunks i love results produced crushing peppers instead grinding them , process produces much more fragrant pepper smell taste dishes . product fairly new my kitchen so i can't tell you how it perform future . i am trusting it now	1

i disappointed this toothbrush holder after putting it use just one day - any drops water run down side holder or end up around bottom edge due splashing/runoff bathroom sink immediately seem trigger bottom holder rust ! i tried keep splashing minimum but this thing started leaving rust-ring my bathroom counter within couple days . i still use it since it nice-looking easily cleaned toothbrush holder but i keep coaster under it protect sink/counter . i wish i could give it more stars since i love look functionality it but i give it only 2 stars since i think making it rust-proof only common sense something sits next your sink . i wonder if all steeltek " stainless-steel " products rust so easily ??	-1

this wonderful utility wood cutting board . when shopping cutting board , there several factors you want consider : material , size , shape , upkeep . material : there several choose , but wood best if you care your knives your chopping arm . wood easiest your knives because blade sink into wood instead dulling it ( if you granite/glass ) . it absorbs shock impact , unlike granite/glass , which quite jarring cut . wood also natural antibacterial properties . there rumors going awhile dangers wood harboring bacteria , but after extensive research , they found out wood actually seems kill bacteria naturally . scientists not able recover bacteria wood board after hour , yet they could recover bacteria plastic after days ... there extensive material this , so i'll let you research more it your own i continue review this board . advantages plastic cutting board over wood board ( it easy clean , dishwasher safe , light , easy store ) goes downhill over time - whereas advantages wood board deteriorates very little over time . biggest reason this plastic cutting board only " cleaner " than wood board when it brand new . soon it gets knife scored , those little crevices harbors bacteria . people say taken care scrubbing soap - but think it , you can't fully clean your teeth just brushing ! why ? because brushing not get into crevices your teeth , that why it crucial floss . now think how much smaller knife cut plastic than crevices your teeth . microscopically smaller , yet large enough lots microscopic bacteria live . then some people say soak plastic board bleach water . this doesn't work either because vacuum effect water surface tension . you'd need able force bleach water into each knife score rinse out bacteria there . water not force it way into vacuum like it own ( what you're doing when you simply dunk it into container bleach water ) . bottom line when it comes plastic vs wood - wood natural anti-bacteria properties not diminish over time , knife scored plastic board not . even all studies people recommending plastic over wood tell you toss plastic board when it becomes badly scored . size shape : i think this 20 15 2.25 size excellent - although , it " heavy duty " size - it also comes thinner model , 1.5 " thick . i like board large enough chop , then move items over little piles off side while i chop something else . rectangle shape allows me this better than square or circle . oval shape might work , but it would harder store since you can't stand it it side . there larger smaller these john boos boards but i think larger one would too bulky heavy ( this board just topmost limit my kitchen countertop handle , my sink wash board ) . this board also 17.33 lbs , which makes it quite bulky heavy . these boards also comes 2 thicknesses : 1.5 " 2.25 " thick . i think if you buy wood board you want it least inch thick . thinner boards warp/break easier . you need it hefty . 1.5 " thick this board perfect regular home chef . 2.25 " thick one good heavy chopping - bones , more line " butcher block " . upkeep : glass/granite break/chip , but otherwise last forever . it easy clean , very pretty , dishwasher safe . it just jarring cut dull your blades . plastic superior everything easy . dishwasher safe . light , easy store , cheap , comes different colors ... but prepared replace it soon it badly knife scored . wood . all materials , wood needs most upkeep . you buy john boos mystery oil which mixture mineral oil , linseed oil tung oil . you can't just use any oil because it needs safe eat case any oil transfer , you don't want oil go rancid . you just oil wood every 4-6 weeks . wood not dishwasher safe . you want avoid ever soaking wood water , although quick scrub rinse through sink , quick thorough drying towel trick just fine . yes , it more work than others , but it not much work , i think it defnitely worth it . one more note wood boards . maple best material becaues it small pore size ratio hardness wood . you might think oak very hard wood , but it bigger pores , so stick maple . john boos cutting board conclusion : i think this perfect cutting board . material , size , shape , weight , all right . john boo also doing this since 1887 , so it good american company that around long enough know little something wood . customer service great well . my only complaint it not very pretty . it quite plain looking . wood boards gorgeous addition my kitchen , warming it up giving it very earthy real feel - but girl , cherry top would if it just " prettier " . one last thing , this board reversible . i don't like when they put little feet one side board prevents you using both sides . this extends use life board i think it shame take away . you always just place removeable , nonslip surface under your wood board keep it place - like silicone pad or sheet non-slip drawer liner stuff .	1
this product god send those people who dog pulls leash thereby making walking dog struggle ! dogs naturally tug against restraint . former methods using choke collar or even worse harsh coller cut into dogs neck if it pulls cruel my opinion method jerking dog back if it pulls . dogs not like thier heads turned if they pull . they immediately stop pulling ! i admit initially my dogs didn't like collar over nose , but passes quickly . this not muzzle any way . it gently humanely stops tugging you happy walks ! this product blessing ! you love it	1

i originally looking bosch turbo jet vac but found out bosch no longer making turbo jet under their name but they now making turbo jet vax . i purchased mine best buy . i really like looks features however this vacuum extremely horrible job carpets . brush roll assembly unit automatically adjusts height carpet however this one if major flaws i noticed hurts it . when you push forward vacuum , brush assembly tilts up toward air preventing brush rollers making contact carpet . there no way you manually adjust height rollers so it make contact carpet . you also cannot tell carpet vacuumed after numerous runs over same area due tilt angle rollers . emissions also bad . vacuum not emit " fresh " air smell but instead emits smell plastic carpet . filter horrilble job emitting clean air . last item i think hurts this model hose unit . it akward design hard use because hose length short hard pull which makes vacuum fall forward times . i returned vacuum different best buy than one i originally purchased . rep returns counter informed me they only carrying vax only few months but they extremely high return rate vax compared their other brands . i walked over vacuum section after i return replace it eureka 4870 which one consumer report top three vacs beats heck out dyson . there must least 7 used vax floor sold returns . eureka amazing blows away vax one hundred dollars less .	-1

now , they even them south ! gentle leader should not confused other head collars like halti . it far superior any dog breed or temperament . i've trained both my golden retrievers well dogs several relatives many friends over past six years using gentle leader . possible exception toy breeds , this god-send any dog owner rambunctious , head-strong or hard handle canine or if you just wants more control without extra work even trauma associated neck collars general . i my first gentle leader dog then my second , walking staying heel , sitting automatically upon stopping , turning both left right no longer lunging , pulling , jumping or straying ... all within less than 15 minutes each dog ! golden retrievers , course , wonderfully easy willing train anyway , but this so incredibly fast , it almost like watching some magic trick performed . it my vet fort lewis , wa who first taught me how fit collar use it . application simple once you see it first time . just place nose strap short flesh nose ( allowing dog breathe , eat , drink even carry items ) tightten head strap one finger tight behind ears ( base head , really ) . this gives you control ( nose strap ) dog sense well-being ( head strap ) . nothing all dogs neck or throat . i strongly encourage you someone experienced gentle leader use show you hot fit it properly first time . all dogs i've since trained or assisted their training there short-lived " leader dance " . this where , after placing leader first time , dog hops air then bows ground all while both front paws over it nose while trying remove collar . you continue give short firm tugs collar while continuing walk dog , dance quickly disappears within just few yards . i amazed how consistant this behaviour its let up always . leader basically uses same physical restraint mother dog or pack alpha male uses control puppy or young dog . grip over nose pressure back neck . it purely coincidental it looks like horse halter . control comes strap over nose . leash clips bottom this strap ( under lower jaw ) . short , quick ( but not violent ) tug leash leash brings entire head under control . head follows nose where head goes , body must follow . there never any need jerking , pulling or strangling dog . there never leash rope burns dog take control lunging away you . your arms stay their sockets , palm blisters thing past ( especially if you use cotton leash , or least leather one ... never use chain or poly-fiber leashes ) . some breeds huge necks high pain tolerance , such rottweilers , easily gently brought into line . my brother 2 years old completely out control . he heel , sitting turning within 5 minutes or so after i turned dog over my brother 15 minutes i took dog back let his 6 year old daughter lead him around . my cute tiny niece less control than dog , yet they both performed team ease . coolest thing head collar how dogs get really excited when they see it , knowing it going walk , training or just out public . they love gentle leader . gentle leader only used training or control . dog still wears its own neck collar , but only keep his tags , since dogs don't normally come pockets . gentle leader also huge facilitator " off-leash " training . dog so comfortable taking properly given commands leash , doing so " off-leash " seems take only one half one third normal time i once involved . , my friends , super endorsement , alone ! one last caution ... i pray you no way person who " stakes " out dog any reason . regardless , gentle leader should never ever used keep dog attached stake or wire run . running out end line coming up short neck/shoulders one thing neck collar . staking dog knowing head collar actually jerk twist head snap neck nothing less than cruelty , if not out out murder . use gentle leader only leash you one end dog other , please . i hope you found this useful , i know you find gentle leader . take care pass good time your canine friend	1

i assembled it all myself while my husband work boy i pleased myself ! chest took me 2 1/2 hours , which i think pretty good since i doing it alone , plus my 4 year old daughter kept distracting me few times ! only real problem came when i started assembling drawers , you could not put guides holes they drilled you because it wouldn't line up right , you move them all way side . bottom drawer sticks more than others . but i deal , maybe one these days i get around trying fix . i noticed drawers open better when you squat down level drawer pull it open . i no problems knobs falling off other people stated , though box end table knobs broken package . i called manufacturer they sending me two new knobs , don't know when they'll arrive though . there also one part assembling chest i skip because screws it called use too small too short where they supposed go .... they go under bottom decorative molding front screw through top chest , but screw way small , would not even go through wood . top screwed tightly down location so i skipped step you could not tell it functions just fine . very sturdy i highly recommend it if you wanting something not too expensive .	1

this pressure cooker bees knees ! i used fagor splendid duo while ( which two slightly smaller sized pots one set also share one pressure lid ) . i recently decided upgrade amazon this newer fagor duo combi 8qt/4qt terrific price two rebates ( one cookbook , other additional fagor " everyday pan " ) so i splurged ... also got free shipping . i'm still waiting rebate items arrive , but amazon i've never problem don't expect one . after this arrived , i promptly showed it off . my folks live next town they so impressed it mom one too . so dad got her this same set christmas replace ancient presto aluminum pressure cooker she used decades ( it its last legs , cooked hundreds upon hundreds great meals) ! old aluminum pressure cookers notorious problems . i've known people who scars pressure cooker accidents . admittedly , i bit leery first . but these newer next-generation pressure cookers very well constructed stainless steel using newer designs locking additionally incorporating several new different safety features design . my fagor splendid , soon i saw how well this new 8qt/4qt elite duo combi made , i felt very comfortable using it ! i must confess , i little skeptical first because fagor recently switched manufacturing spain " designing spain , manufacturing china " , but any concerns i quality quickly assuaged when i got set took it its first " test drive " stove , then cooked few meals . i'm happy report , no problems quality i tell . cooker : lid goes pretty easily . i'd give it 8.5 or 9 out possible 10 this area ... because there slight learning curve getting lid on/off , but nothing really worry . it well engineered lid fits both pots very well . both pots heat evenly come up temperature pressure very quickly . dual-pressure valve snap use ! just turn dial full pressure ( 15 psi ) or half pressure ( 8 psi ) . when it time release pressure , there third setting which opens valve let steam escape rapidly ... this great feature!i'd like add something which i found important . diameter . this set full 10 " diameter which makes browning either pot breeze . ( splendid set pots only 9 " diameter ) . so finding one 10 " near top my list ... this one didn't disappoint ! before upgrading pressure cookers , i researched several makes/models it looks like all them exception kuhn-rikon now made china . i like kr but it expensive largest pot 7 litres , whereas this model fagor 8 quart little roomier . using included glass lid , large pot doubles stock pot , pasta cooker , or steamer using included basket . you also pressure cook whole chicken ( or large roast ) still room vegetables . smaller sized pot doubles skillet ( also using included glass lid ) or it works great smaller pressure cooker smaller items or things you would cook flat such chicken breasts , etc . one final thing , handle design newer fagor pots great , helper handle front well loop design main handle allows you get your hand around handle grip it well when you need move it while it full ( or hot ) . overall , this great product i highly recommend it !	1
