i picked up dozen home depot less than $5 . same concept , just lot cheaper ! two them holding huge heavy shelf my kitchen . hole they make depends upon weight what they're holding . i'm sure it pinhole sized if you're hanging something weighs few ounces ( which case , you don't need this - use pushpin ! )the holes shelf bigger than pin-sized , but it heavy shelf . hole still way smaller than hole i'd make using any kind hook would hold such heavy shelf . it also takes little practice figure out where hang hooks ( drop hook below where you might want thing actually hang . ) this small detail , but if you need two these things you don't it right , your object gonna crooked . but bright side , you won't huge hole patch when you redo it ! recommended product ( but look around knockoffs .	1
kitchenaid kfpw760 exactly advertised . it three nested work bowls . inner , smallest one takes special blade ( smaller version standard processor blade ) . it perfect pulverizing/mixing small quantities things . pulling used bowl out leaves next one ready use without stop clean something . same true next one until you reach largest , 12 cup bowl . number blades come well designed transparent strong storage box ( finally , way keep everything together ) . unit even fruit juicer accessory replaces bowl . it kind rotating hub ( two hub sizes included , one lemons larger one oranges , etc ) . while it seems work , it not convenient low cost dedicated version such black decker , but what heck , it worth trying . motor quiet you get real feeling professionalism when using it . first i disappointed there weren't any fancy front panel switch options , but after thinking it , you only need provided , off pulse . would i buy it again ? absolutely . would i buy it again amazon ? again , absolutely . transaction without difficulty shipment actually came earlier than promised	1

after reading every review deep fryers i could find , i finally decided this one . it great i couldn't ask anything better or more easy use . i put it my cooktop let my big hood suck away any odors . it heats up quickly food always come out great . we made donuts after cooking shrimp halibut no cross-odors or tastes ! my family only tolerates fish , so this greatly appreciated . cleanup easy also . after waiting oil cool , pan , lid rack go into dishwasher . only heating element cleaned hand it quite easy . oil used many times without problems so it more economical use than i originally thought it would . i would recommend this no caveats	1

i've through four these expensive units . they work great my great pyrenees dog . least they work awhile . then i end up trying figure out if batteries dead , then if new batteries i put dead begin , then i send it back repair . once i got back unit worked again - awhile . then i got back unit never worked again . i stopped sending my broken units after . so - desperation , impending poverty , i switched shock collar ; it either or what my breeder calls " blue juice special " . it also worked - yes , i tried it myself decided it wasn't cruel all . but punchline this : shock collars broke same rate citronella collar . least they cheaper , so i didn't lose much money	-1
i set it up my dogs because they bark whenever they hear noise or if someone rings bell , i 3 dogs , i put it they went beserk , they started going after each other , i didn't hear anything myself , but i am quite sure dogs , like i said they acted very badly towards each other , tone must made them lash out like . i cannot use it anymore .	-1
it appears viatek product ( bark stop pro ) related lentek design ( pc16 ; asin : b0002q89o6 ) - they based common design lentek engineer . i used ( tried ) viatek bark stop pro it definitely not work . my experience same reviewer lentek pc16 who noted unit only works " audible " setting - dogs least perk up their ears high pitch tone ; they completely ignore whatever emitted " ultrasonic " setting . furthermore , it often activated extraneous noises like birds , banging doors , wind noise , etc . this really poor functionality due either poor design or poor construction / quality . i've tried two different units they both not work . negative reenforcement concept could work if only these devices tuned noise environment could filter out all except actual barks .	-1

i baked six loaves this machine . i using various bread machines past 12 years feel comfortable making adjustments when things don't turn out just right . my big complaint this machine low baking temperatures . even darkest crust setting longest baking time ( 70 minutes ) , my loaves only marginally acceptable - they not sufficiently baked . i using nearly-whole wheat recipe . machine quiet , strong , lot bells whistles , but only partially baked bread , i return it amazon . amazon shipped it me very poorly packed box which gaping open when it arrived , but they included return labels which made it cinch send back , quick enough refund	-1
