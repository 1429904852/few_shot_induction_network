" balls " squeezed into box flattened . taste not very " peanutty " . i'm disappointed	-1
this salmon jerky so unbelievably tough , it pretty much inedible . when you painstakingly gnaw it , it doesn't release much flavor , but instead just turns into sharpish little sticks your mouth . i misfortune ordering this , 7 8 bags still untouched , i'm not sure what them . i even tried soaking jerky , tried boiling it some macaroni , nothing seems soften this stuff up ! what waste money . go some beef jerky instead , if you need salmon , eat it fresh or canned . this product joke	-1
we've enjoyed these cookies months they available purchase our local costco warehouse . just purchased them bulk here amazon terribly disappointed find they arrived hard rocks stuck together . they don't expire until july , 2007 , so we're guessing something happened them storage ? we opened several packages they're all same . reason i am even taking time write this review say amazon online policy states grocery gourmet foods not returnable . you kidding ? i case $30 cookies simply not fit prime time snacking . i've e-mailed customer service regarding my delivery . it doubtful i'll order grocery items again i assumed return policy defective goods would same . just not worth hassle . update : amazon shipped us replacement order . unfortunately , again , all twelve packages hard . each package three rows cookies , each row stuck together each cookie must pried next . actually , it mute point doing this cookies simply inedible they hard , hard , hard . date package : 11 jul 07 , i suggest problem exists this batch , either storage or manufacturer .	-1
although this good coffee , i expecting something tasted like cappuccino . this coffee tastes nothing like it , it doesn't even hint cinnimon flavor package suggests . if you want regular coffee , then this coffee buy , but if you're looking cappuccino , save your money	-1

these cookies ok , just ok . i may inclined give them three stars they arrived whole cookies , every last cookies broken . i understand this probably due poor packaging . consistency bit grainy dry though . milk not help . next time i'll purchase chewy brand or mrs. fields	-1
this very weak coffee . not buy unless you like it way	-1
great idea poorly executed extremely unappetizing presentation . this someone who makes flavored rice few times week . said , this worst review i ever given anywhere , so bear me . you know how sometimes rice sticks bottom pan if you overcook you boil it out it turns oddly clear but covered carbon water ? yeah . like . rice came out sticky ( not it palatable uniform japanese steamed rice way ) almost alien kind translucent brown nothing like picture . nothing . if you look closely , you might able tell it once rice . yes , i followed instructions . my husband , who wanted try fresh rice work , described it abomination , which relief me because when it cooking it stenched up house horrifying yet familiar odor when i put my finger it smelled exactly , exactly , like onondaga lake syracuse ny summer back when it most polluted lake world people warned never eat fish they caught ( assuming there any alive there ) kids weren't allowed wade it . it smells like raw sewage , dead fish , rotting feathers chicken soup . it 45f out i opened window . sometimes you buy case something it turns out something you don't care , maybe it too much onion or whatever , but you know someone else like it . normally i donate these things needy family . i think this case it would cruel . i can't imagine anyone who made rice their own mistaking this rice . yourself favor just drop boullion cube pot your stovetop rice . that what they're trying here failing miserably . i can't sell rest auction site because i'm afraid even if i am completely honest smell i get bad rating . only thing i think use them smoke out people breakroom odor next april fool day	-1

when i think " dark roast " i think full bodied dark . melitta pods worst i've tried . i've tried senseo pods too which only mediocre . i find target brand " archer farms " pods best . french roast really rival starbucks home brewed . its cheap too ... 3.99 18 pods . if you like full bodied , rich , dark strong cup cofee , don't melitta . i found senseo archer farms pods fit my melitta pod brewer just fine	-1
mushroom soup one my favorites , so i very disappointed this version . i agree totally first reviewer - this one bland tasteless soup . i'm only giving it any stars all because it organic attempt appreciated .	-1
i bought case these amazon because someone some candy forum claimed these " excellent " quality they comparable premium brands like haribro . don't believe it . these cheapo gummi bears , no better than whatever cheapo junk your local drugstore/supermarket/bigbox sells . pretty squishy ( not very chewy ) , variety bland flavors all taste mostly like sweet . there no point buying these	-1
stay away ! amazon sent me 1 bag coffee pods . 18 pods total , not pack 12 like advertised . unless you want pay $30+ 18 generic coffee pods , stay away . i returning my product asap	-1

i really excited ordering this set thrilled when it came . i noticed something unexpected teas , however . teas i tried this set i noticed unpleasant dry aftertaste . taster noticed same thing without my mentioning it . i really like glass tea pot . it very nice watch tea fill glass orb color flavor . whether flowers beautiful or look more like sea urchins matter personal taste . i high hopes starlight rose tea ( white tea leaves rosebud ) found it far inferior rose petal black blended tea republic tea , which excellent . other hand , numi moroccan mint one finest teas i ever tasted , superior old favorite mine- stash tea moroccan mint . after tasting this tea i am surprised number reviews rating tea comes set quite good . maybe i got bad batch or strange taste buds- but there it . bamboo box quite charming	-1
i bought whole box these , they tasted really rancid . they several months their expiration date , so wasn't problem . maybe i just got bad batch , but i'd unlikely ever try them again	-1
when you dirt your food you wonder what you really eating . otherwise flavor wasn't bad . i just can't eat dirt . it bad teeth	-1
i love flavor this sauce but it rarely arrives undamaged . packaging needs contain little tlc , then it would 5 stars . don't order if you need this certain dinner , it may not arrive usable	-1
but i may never know . i ordered this item october 27 . when shipment finally arrived , there only one container this inside ! i ordered four pack i'm sure . so amazon offered try again sending item , but it now november 30th . item stock whole time so i'm not sure what caused delay . i'm just thankful i ordered it just try it out , i didn't actually need it any certain date .	-1

home beyond true value offers this 12 pack coffee filters 40 each pack . i ordered two 12 packs 40 coffee filters each home beyond only sent two packs 40 . not 24 packs i ordered paid . my advice not business home beyond or true value when buying these coffee filters because they not ship what listing says . until amazon starts enforcing home beyond true value honor what they list their offerings , imho then buyers need go somewhere else . weight says 4.20 pounds . they trying say one tiny pack 40 paper coffee filters weighs 4.20 pounds ??	-1
these horrible . i thought i'd try raw foods i amde big mistake	-1
i've found timothy k-cups consistently good , better than green mountain varieties i tried ( i haven't found green mountain i like yet ! ) but parisian night first timothy offering didn't impress me . i bought two boxes it amazon tried using different brew strengths , but it always tastes bland . it bold strong advertised , but plebeian . someone who just bought keurig this blend their first cup , it might taste pretty good ; but compared all other , better k-cup varieties available , this one better off skipped . i think it just fancy name boring blend nothing distinctive it all . their " midnight " dark roast definitely more tasty , even better than their columbian italian k-cups , which very smooth . i think timothy best columbian k-cups market . but parisian night , well ... let just say everybody makes mistakes	-1
i bit disappointed these . they crumble very easily unusual texture . my son ( 6 ) not like them	-1
skippy pulls worst kind nonsense this product - claiming it all natural , which technically true , but also implying since it natural , it healthy , which false this product sice they ruined it . real peanut butter contains one ingredient : peanuts , maybe dash salt . nothing else . real peanut butter very good you . skippy adds palm oil , tropical oil which , while it slightlybetter than soem other tropical oils , still contains saturated fats completely unnecessary , this " spread " . why ? so poor widdle you doesn't spend whole four seconds stirring it . course , this would all lot more clear if amazon actually nutrtion labels available , but they don't - nor they carry any kind actual all-natural peanut butter . skip this , skip all so-called " peanut butters " carreied here , go yoru local store get soem real natural peanut butter . look label - if it any other ingredient than peanuts salt , put it back shelf . nothing else necessary	-1
i drink all types teas , but this one worst tasting teas , my opinion	-1
i wanted like this bar because it high protein fiber , but it also unfortunately high added sugars ( 31g ! ) . it much too sweet . if they took away some sugar , it might edible .	-1
quality this tea not very good , especially compared other superb teas two leaves bud . mostly powder inside bag , very strong " grassy " smell somewhat bitter aftertaste . top it took 2 weeks amazon deliver it .	-1
donot buy it . i got stuff even past expiration day	-1

i wouldn't describe this jerky shredded but instead powdered . it not something you tap into your hand eat like snack . best use we found pour one little tubes onto salad added protein . still , it fairly short shelf life jerky ; unopened tubes gone bad ( mold ? or something ? ick ) within 3 months	-1
it not regular , strong earl grey twinings i come love . this version lacks strength flavor - two teabags needed regular strength tea . it even states box - light flavour strenght ( 2 leaves out five ) . beware !	-1
newly re-packaged twinings earl grey tea ( word " classics " package ) much , much weaker than previous twinings earl grey tea . if you used like old teas , then you won't like new version . i wonder if they weakened britsh version twinings earl grey tea	-1

5 stars stevia product ... natural , delicious ! 0 stars amazon inability correctly store this item their warehouses . i experienced same trouble other reviewers , packets showing up hard useless . when purchased store , i never one hard or brittle packet . don't bother purchasing amazon , instead head your local trader joe where you purchase 100 packets $5.99 . not fiber supplement type , but doesn't clump more per packet . amazon really shouldn't even bother selling this product if stevia shows up ruined	-1
i should known there something fishy when product details said product dimensions 13 10.5 2.5 inches 3.8 pounds when shipping weight said 2.15 pounds . actuality it 12 10 2.5 comes cheap ( not even know if it wood ) box it weighs 1.14 pounds my postal scale . however , fair , i not taken plastic wrapper off because it gift so it could very , very thin wood . addition , container opens like box rather than chest . there no hinges back . i am very disappointed this tea " chest " it price	-1

this purchase my husband . ( need i say more , ladies ? ) this soup(if you even call it ) waste money . there hardly any seafood it all , what little there , it small pieces . it more like ' cream ' . my son husband both big soup eaters , love chowder . let just say he bought case stuff 10 cans still sitting pantry awaiting next garbage day ! i admit i didn't try it ... it didn't smell or look appealing . but if my husband ( human garbage ) says it awful stuff , i take his word it .... so should you !	-1
edited review : my first order came leaking jars . amazon replaced second order arrived good condition . one star , which i can't seem change , reflected fact . my updated review three stars . i mildy disappointed this topping . out jar , black olives artichokes provide flavor definate sour notes . texture ingrediants pasty ( opposed chunky ) . i would given this only two stars if this supposed pasta sauce . however , i followed directions jar create their version bruschetta . it acceptable . since this billed " topping " i am willing give it three stars since capacity performs pleasurable level . vodka sauce much more my liking .	-1
if you really like chinese food , you might like this chicken stew . however , it much too sweet tasting my tastes . main reason i give it 2 stars it contains artificial sweetner splenda ( see " sucralose " ingredients ) , but not advertised anywhere package besides small print ingredient list . i personally don't eat or drink products contain artificial sweetners various reasons , i known product contained splenda , i wouldn't purchased it honestly . it typical splenda " after taste .	-1
it not quite bad i expected , but strawberry delight flavor frosted mini-wheats suffer most how it looks , unnatural pink color dyed into wheat biscuits such way make them wholly unappetizing . otherwise , it offers sweetened taste barely reminds me real strawberries , least point where you wonder what point this variation kellogg . one 42-gram serving , mini-box , equals higher-than-average 140 calories but only five fat . other good news there no measurable sodium cholesterol cereal . i would think adding real strawberries or even dried berry variations would preferable this cereal , so i think i'll leave this pass	-1
i bought two flavors gloria jeans k-cups . i loved price . coffee wonderful (!) , but i hate getting grounds my coffee ! i've 1 5 cups coffee grounds * under * filter , so when coffee brews they end up my cup -- 1/2 teaspoon per cup . lower price = poorer manufacturing standards .	-1
says it all . this cereal just too sweet . their flax cereal better	-1

although i like consider myself open ' cultural cuisine ' , i found myself spitting this stuff out - after paying $6 it international marketplace . my significant other same . i like salty stuff , i love licorice , but this just plain nasty . not only it too salty , but it terrible rubbing-alcohol-type flavor went up my nose made me wonder if perhaps candy tampered or manufactured incorrectly . i went online read some other reviews ... other people similar experiences . i guess it one those acquired tastes developed early . oh , those dutch !! i love ' em ( but hate this " candy " )	-1
i ordered both this honey nut version . i wish i paid more attention low fat part this version . this version hard too cinnamon/sugary which seems happen w/ some low-fat cereals . they compensate low fat sugaring it up end up w/ hard less tasty less filling product . however , honey nut version very good . it good crunch , but not too hard tasty almond slivers it . it sweet , but not overly granola , no cinnamon taste all . i understand many products w/ raisins add cinnamon i typically like cinnamon , but this version too much raisins too dried out hard . package very convenient though . i now mix regular version w/ this product help me get rid low fat stuff . some label info : low fat w/ raisin ( lf ) 180 calories per 1/2 cup while honey nut ( hn ) only 20 more 200 . there 12 1/2 cup servings hn while lf only 10 . product weight hn 24 oz lf 20.5 oz . finally sugars hn 11g while lf 15g	-1

i purchased diamond pecans their shells december ' 06 ( note , not these , already shelled ones ) discovered after kids eating them they all rancid . sure check dates ( if you , there weren't any in-shell nuts ) because there not much worse than ruining whatever you're trying make rancid nuts . i learned only purchase pecans places dates package or where i smell taste them	-1
i agree quality nothing sneeze . these fill me up , i know they're pretty good you , i like nutty essence too . i guess i really disappointed taste , though . chocolate slightly bitter-tasting , took me surprise . i love other flavors , but this one my leat favorite . i would recommend almond butter balls before this one , they're soft little more sweet side	-1
i bought these because they described : " 100% all-natural dry roasted almonds " . now i read label states these contain : maltodextrin , modified potato starch , sugar , msg , autolyzed yeast extract , modified corn syrup solids , modified corn starch , salt ...	-1
this terrible tasting bar . i tried many raw bars this one far worst i've ever tasted . it leaves after taste .	-1
this type machine just cannot make good espresso . espresso must made fine grind beans , correct temperature water , high water pressure extract right amount flavor beans right amount time . quick/no-fuss machine like tassimo , some these ingredients missing this machine process , so espresso turns out rather sour . adding latte milk covers up worst it , but it not great latte either . stick regular coffee tassimo , although it not wonderful either , it might get you through morning	-1
not fooled this sugar coated seemingly delectable pastry ! i long time fan original pop-tart go-tart just seemed like natural progression things , so i went newest technology mass produced baked goods . go-tart offers you pop-tart go , because everyone knows this 21st century we move . i'm venturing guess go-gurt success so why not make go-tart ? well , there number reasons . actually just one . you already eat pop tart go . it too bad go-tart ruined everything i loved pop-tart . greatest hope i this flop product frosting ( or what you'd like call sugary stuff top ) would reach corners tart , unlike original pop-tart . though sugar covers corners , there barely any frosting all this tart ! it but thin line sugary goodness we would all expect normal pop-tart . filling gooey consistency , worst all , breading part crumbled my hand . i eat my go-tart pieces . this clearly not go . this worse than pop-tart , probably more fattening than one . save your money , boycott go-tart	-1
i excited get these but not read ingrediants before purchasing . big mistake . me they far too sweet almost sappy tasting . i dont feel like im eating something healthy rather some those chewy snakcs they make kids . high fructose insane really i feel they would better off fraction what they add .	-1

not great coffee . rocamojo puravida , which amazon also sells so much better -- those aren't great just good . this cheap coffee tastes like it . i can't complain much $3 pound but it just ok , drinkable , but wouldn't buy again .	-1
i'm sorry , but these just weren't me , they somewhat stale taste . i recommend buying single bag before buying case if you all hesitant	-1
too salty me , there better brand out there	-1
they sounded good , but aren't tart enough my taste prepared too much sugar	-1
i thought this product reasonably good taste , but i two major issues it . first , they describe this kettle corn . it not kettle corn - not even close . this caramel corn thick sweet coating . real kettle corn slightly sweet , slightly salty popcorn . second , each very small bag 1.5 servings it . when last time you opened small bag snack food only ate 2/3 it ? they purposely made serving size unrealistic make it look healthier . whole point paying individual size bags it limits you set portion . remember when coke 1.5 servings it ? fda made them change label . if you eat whole bag , you eating 200 calories popcorn . no better bag potato chips or few cookies , so this not lesser evil - it just same old junk food new name . i won't buy this product again . it same stuff you get anywhere	-1
i bought two flavors gloria jeans k-cups . i loved price . coffee good , but i hate getting grounds my coffee ! i've 1 5 cups coffee grounds * under * filter , so when coffee brews they end up my cup -- 1/2 teaspoon per cup . lower price = poorer manufacturing standards	-1

espresso beans roasted different ways . lavazza illy represent best two different approaches roasting beans italian espresso . illy roasts their beans longer time , but lower temperature , than lavazza . result its higher roasting temperature lavazza darker , according some people more robust , than illy . its best , when properly ground , tamped , brewed , lavazza espresso bit stronger tasting also little bit more bitter than illy . lavazza espresso also very pure black color once brewed when it properly it hint licorice aftertaste . personally , though , i prefer illy approach which why i am giving this coffee four rather than five stars . but , even so , i certainly recognize high quality lavazza . my opinion lavazza represents very best widely available dark ( opposed medium like illy ) italian espresso roasts	1

now , one reviewers this product complained sugar content this cereal only looking ingredients list , which not how determine nutritional value any product ( especially when reviewer cannot distinguish nutritive non-nutritive ingredients ) . this cereal just many simple sugars frosted flakes , but cereal not claim low sugar . what important this cereal it offers quite bit fiber vitamins/minerals ( not much some cereals , but since i no deficiencies this area , i didn't mind ) . also , it only 3 times salt half cup milk which not loaded . healthy choice soup , now loaded salt . now , i chose this cereal replacement frosted flakes/honey nut cheerios , which against my better judgment i continued every morning . i should point out i don't drink coffee mornings i don't drink soda ( less than 1 week average ) . i also eat no sweets . simple sugars ( listed just " sugars " nutrition label ) seem treated like carcinogens , while most people don't realize aspartame ( artificial sweetener most diet sodas ) really one . if your diet already low sugar you feel confident you burn through those sugars pretty quick ( since i don't drink caffeinated drinks , i need jolt morning ) , then this good choice . if your diet already quite bit sugar or your doctor tells you cut down simple sugars ( or you also couple cups caffeinated coffee sugar every morning ) , then go bran cereal without oat clusters syrups ( which i really not like much ) . also , if you concerned total carbs , please note normal 2000 calories diet would include 300g carbohydrates ( so yes , high protein diets contradict this ) . since taste completely subjective , i won't put much emphasis it . my opinion , it tastes pretty good ( but i don't consume many sweets during day ) .	1
these cookies nice break run-of-the-mill granola bar . based oatmeal , not too sweet , filling . great value . i would purchase again	1

i use this mostly my coffee tea find it adds kind sweetness i enjoy . i've others try it some liked it much i , others said it wasn't them . i remember reading years ago stevia slight licorice taste it , but i don't detect any sort taste all . my online research leads me believe might something inulin fiber ( fos ) thats also part this sweetener . i tried splenda didn't like it . everyone tastes body chemistry different , but if you're looking reduce amount sugar your diet without feeling like you suffering it , then give this try	1

this best tasting shredded (= dessicated ) coconut i found anywhere usa . it organic sulfite free . this unsweetened , finely shredded , very small pieces dessicated coconut which used south east asia , australia etc . this not same product american style coconut , which most common type baker sweetened angel flake coconut . i like buy finely shredded/dessicated coconut because i often bake australian , british european style cakes cookies , which not work well when made flake coconut . i also discovered finely shredded coconut used make your own coconut milk or coconut cream home . flake coconut dessicated coconut different taste texture . cup sweetened angel flake coconut 2 tablespoons sugar added it , so it very sweet compared shredded/dessicated coconut , which no added sugar all . shredded/dessicated coconut drier pieces very small compared flakes , so it more surface area . because these two things , 8oz dessicated coconut absorb more liquid than 8oz flake coconut . some recipes work quite well either kind coconut , but others not , even if you compensate sugar liquid . its better , especially baking , use whatever recipe originally calls . coconut i received amazon tasted very fresh good use date . if you want increase shelf life coconut , throw bags into freezer or refrigerator . they keep there year . once bag opened , i always keep it refrigerator . i don't like buying this kind coconut health food stores , it often comes bulk bins exposed air . unsweetened organic coconut get stale or even develop rancid taste if it stored open air . sweetened flake coconut much more stable because it contains preservatives sugar . if you australian wanting make things like lamingtons or coconut ice , you need use dessicated/finely shredded cooconut . flake coconut not give right results . dessicated/finely shredded coconut also excellent replicating those little coconut macaroon cookies you find many chinese buffet restaurants . shredded/dessicated coconut mixed water make your own coconut milk or coconut cream . i find this useful because i rarely use more than 1/2 when i cook coconut milk ( curries , soups , laksa etc ) . sometimes i only want spoonful or two , add little flavor smoothie or banana cake . i tried making coconut milk flake coconut , but my taste , it way too sweet not good texture . make coconut milk dessicated coconut : method 1 . put equal parts coconut hot water weight into blender ( eg 8oz coconut 1 cup hot water ) . whizz blender minute or two . if desired , you strain press it through cloth or fine sieve when it cooled down . this not necessary most recipes , unless you require silky smooth texture end product . lighter coconut milk , use 8oz coconut one half cups water , or you use " lite " shredded coconut start . method 2 . simmer equal parts weight coconut hot water until froth appears . not boil . remove heat let it sit until it cools down . if desired , you strain it through cloth bag or very fine sieve , pressing out much liquid possible . make thick coconut cream dessicated coconut : use either method above , but use 4 parts coconut one part water . i thought price amazon excellent , especially organic product . time purchase , it worked out one dollar forty two cents per 8oz bag my case , shipping free . i can't find organic dessicated coconut anywhere else this price . overall i very pleased taste , freshness , price quality this coconut . i don't think i any problems using up 12 packets one year , especially i won't buying any cans coconut milk .	1
i used these add christmas gift basket , filled special cocoa mix , spiced tea mix , fancy jam spread , three or four scones , family friends .... unexpected company . everyone loved them , i apackage or tow left myself .... they delicious . they such good value money , exdciting addition these gift boxes	1
taste ok , but not great . one thing this somewhat annoying it two serving packet which means it makes 16 ounces liquid . i really only want eat up 8 ounces time . means i guess how much half then roll up bag save remaining portion . even if i want eat entire packet , i don't bowl 16 ounces ( all my bowls perfectly normal sized ) . bottom line here there nothing wrong taste soup ( still , i'm not love it ) . i just wish there better way packaging . i'm only one eating it , maybe affects my opinion . if you more than one person your family then it won't problem all , you ignore everything i've said .	1
i love this tea ! it very refreshing , wonderful aroma . it doesn't get bitter like other green teas . once i tried this green tea , this only one me .	1
i recieved variety pack today tried this flavor first . i buy natural snacks my kids ( freeze dried fruit etc no added sugar ) , but i find them bland . so i ordered these i love them . fact my 4 year old wanted try she liked it - it wasn't too spicy her . you tell they used " hot " spices , but they very well so not too much . nuts big crunchy fruit small chewy . there equal both nuts fruit . they use evaporated cane juice organic tapioca syrup , but these healthier than alternatives there still only 5 grams sugar per 1/4 cup serving	1
i love soups stews i am love this seafood chowder . it absolute best flavor chock full variety seafood . taste great !! i've tried many many chowders this ranks highest any i ever eaten .... even legal seafood or wolfgang puck or several local massachsetts seaside restaurants . it all natural no artificial ingredients . i recommend this everyone who loves seafood chowders . all baxter soups chowders , this really only one i recommend everyone try . i repeat ... it great !! it bit high salt though ..... ~ 1,400 mg/can but if this only salty food eaten all day ... it ok . try it .... it heavenly !	1

when mini-wheats first came out grocery store , i tried them . however , i found they bland . it like trying eat sticks milk . then came " frosted " mini-wheats . okay , i decided give it go . now i sticks sugar milk . however , i find out if you forego milk just eat them straight box , like potato chips , they excellent ! now kellogg added fruity flavors mini-wheat . these i eat milk ! yippee ! finally ! i picked up " strawberry delight " bite size . even though i eat them milk , i find i still prefer just eat them straight box , like potato chips , type chex-mix , or square wheat thin snack . each serving 140 calories . compare other cereals you'll see it 60 - 100 calories less . no saturated fat . no trans fat . no cholesterol . no sodium . total fat only 0.5 according box . i don't see how , since zero zero , well , zero . but i live 0.5 . here bad news , carbohydrates . there 35g carbs here . but same all other brands . diabetics may want pass this due 10g sugar per serving . remember , single serving size half base ball . not much . so if you just pouring cereal into " cereal bowl " without measuring , you probably getting 2 or 3 servings one bowl . all-in-all , unless you diabetic , this mini-wheat terrific ! reviewed detra fitch huntress reviews	1

i love granola cereal general , but i say this very best granola i ever . people bear naked philosophy i love , which back every bag : " we believe food should hand-made wholesome natural ingredients you actually pronounce . " although i eat processed food , i appreciate appeal more traditionally prepared foods , this granola tops list nutrition taste . like most granola , it high calories fat , but take note fat comes largely nuts contained ( it also contains expeller pressed canola oil ) , it no trans fat , only 1.5 saturated fat per serving . this cereal softer than most granola , though not soft enough me consider it chewy . it large chunks nuts also contains cranberries flax seed , optimal nutritional digestive health . six-pack sold amazon makes price per package reasonable ( ingredients quite expensive ) , so value proposition , i think this not only great product , but great buy . delicious nutritious : great combination i recommend highly	1

this one those items i buy regularly grocery store i got less amazo	1
never heard it . some research decided try it . extremely satisfied my choice ! i went " light " version since my research mentioned it one no strong after-taste . much better , natural choice than artificial sweeteners . calories , but glycemic index response very good ; translation : it doesn't give you " sugar rush " . i like things fairly sweet , so i use 2-3 teaspoons per cup coffee . you may need less . definitely get 12 pack !!! best value you'll amazed how much you start using it !	1
you ever described food tasting " healthy " when you mean it tastes so bad it must good you ? fear not ! it pleasantly adaptable use any fruit hand . i honestly say , though , it earthy quality . it may take uninitiated some getting acquainted -- just little ! if trying first time , i heartily recommend trying hemp goddess supreme recipe jar label . surprisingly palatable ! you'll proud something nourishing healthy yourself . easy digest . powder indeed rather coarse . when you find it'll tide you over very well until your next meal , you won't mind . including this one eating habits only addition positive	1
this one great products we love envirokidz ! gorilla munch panda puffs both favorites our house although we eat all their gluten-free cereals . i highly recommend their products those needing gluten-free products especialy when making transition kids	1
this my favorite gluten free cereal hands down . let face it- it isn't nutritious . this not health cereal . but thank goodness ! it also won't send you absolute sugar shock , either- i love peanut butter flavor . it good light snack breakfast- i bet it would good recipes too .	1
i love this cereal ! some unknown reason , most grocery stores not carry it i lot difficulty finding it anywhere . i'm glad find it online , but see it currently unavailable amazon	1
i just love this cereal - it sooo crunchy tasty - i eat them right out box don't feel guilty ! they aren't sold here anymore so i'm glad i get them here	1

please realize these not cookies much crackers . they sweet taste , but don't expect oreo taste hazelnut much more subtle than other tastes . overall , excellent - i very much enjoyed them	1
amazon delivered exactly what i ordered time . me , nutiva vco great alternative unhealthy cooking oils . if we compare short-chain fatty acids ( such lauric chains coconut oil ) which metabolized within mitochondria cells , versus longer chain-bearing oils which require conjugation transport liver , i think vco must healthier me overall . nutiva also tastes good frankly people , it great lotion . yes , it takes few minutes sink , but once it , you soft skin .	1
reviewer called this " genetically engineered horror " ( same review gave high ratings poptarts ! - not they taste bad , but they pretty high sugar artificial stuff ) . i believe name company " just tomatoes " name product " just rasberries " . freeze dried fruit hardly genetically engineered horror . it just rasberries-nothing else added very good taste very healthy . i like rasberries strawberries best . i used them my cereal , snack out box , yougurt smoothies . if you like certain fruits when they not season don't care frozen , these fit bill	1
this very tasty bar ! i tried almost every raw food bar market this definitly one best ! it not too heavy tastes soooooooo good ... i mentioned it yummy ? lol .	1

ah , it definite american story - 1969 friends mo siegel wyck hay colorado began selling herbal teas they previously only made themselves . such small beginnings came famous tea company - celestial seasonings . among celestial seasonings ' many products sleepytime , herbal infusion such wonderfully different taste i able win my wife over it , she not consider herself tea drinker . many evenings when i brew up some sleepytime go my famous spiced bread ! anyway , sleepytime largely mixture chamomile spearmint , which produces healthy drink wonderful aroma taste . i'm sure i cannot adequately describe taste - it doesn't taste like anything you've ever tried before , but its seductive flavors win you over . if i could make one suggestion celestial seasonings , it would change name something else . i've friends refuse try it , afraid tea make them feel drowsy . you buy sleepytime valerian root , which definitely promotes sleepiness , but regular product just pleasant herbal drink . i suppose it called sleepytime because its fresh spearmint tastes very good late evening , its natural lack caffeine means it won't keep you awake . but , this wonderful product tastes great any time day ! way , it also makes unique , zingy iced tea	1
we glad see amazon started carrying this kenya blend . after discovering it europe bringing several pacakges over , we later some shipped us family belgium . this nice subtle yet defined taste i particularly like it afternoon cookie ( covered belgian chocolate ! ) or biscotti . recommended any senseo lover tired regular blends found retails stores	1
i actually drink this cold . i brew entire pitcher it ( hot ) then put it fridge enjoy cold beverage . this tea nice mango ( not overpowering ) flavor both refreshing crisp . i yet try bentley tea i haven't enjoyed , so i wouldn't hesitate recommend this flavor , or bentley general ! good stuff	1

i've miso soups various restaurants this actually really good . i love fact they environmentally concerned their products . i'll buy their products just knowing they care so much how much we throw away , so it biodegradable . only thing i'm not crazy noodles , i would preferred thinner noodle , only because it so bulky , not really typical asian dish	1
finally there quick way make great udon soup home ! any udon fan , this must try product . noodles good udon noodles get , soup mix great base start your udon . here way we make udon using this product base : we take noodles soup mix two packages ( bowls ) , add some additional soy sauce spices we like , boil it all pan ( you don't need screw around all noodle rinsing , just throw them pot ) . when soup noodles warm , we add chopped romaine . this super good , costs less than $[ ... ] two large servings udon - deal any standard !! when we really want full-on udon , we add some sliced pressed fish like restaurants use traditional udon ( half moon pressed fish , white orange/red coating ) shrimp . this heavenly !!	1
picked them up local whole foods we love them -lots crunch - my lasy loves seedlander i love muesli - i highly recommend these	1

very high quality meat just enough spice , processed just enough make it slightly soft . if it wasn't so addictively good , i'd order bag right now !	1
yes , this beef jerky hot . that why it " hot spicy . " if you always order your mexican or chinese food mild , i'd say get different flavor . spice blend ( which mostly hot pepper ) pretty good . quality beef good or better than any mass-market beef jerky you pick up your local store . big difference ? this stuff 1/4 price . if you like beef jerky , buy this brand . there no better value out there unless you're making it yourself . i'll probably order some every time i order books	1

annie chun rice express sushi wraps rice bowl wonderful product , tastes great , most all , kids love it !	1
i ordered this when it gold box deal i would order again even higher price . reading reviews just reaffirms old adage you can't please everyone . i'm happy there no added flavor rice . rice quite tasty it . we gone culture modify everything ? today world we don't taste what we prepared eat . we only taste condiments we pour onto or into it . i thought wraps where big enough . how hard it roll sushi goodness sakes . i thought salt taste wraps added little rush flavor when i bit into sushi . all all i think this great option lunch good value . roll your own helps you slow down your eating allows feel full just time you munch last bite . tomorrow , i think i'll add some tuna ! yummy	1
this great buy i recommended it everyone . i would use amazone again all my needs	1
product very good delivered promptly . i am curious know why it hard find local store shelves	1
not instant , package says . fair , package also , somewhat smaller less prominent print , detailed statement telling buyer microwaving/cooking necessary . but if you just look package front , you'll get impression you make this like you make instant oatmeal . not so . i hate using microwaves , so big turn-off me . all said , stuff delicious definitely warms me up fills my tummy , keeping me getting hungry better than most oatmeals . texture thicker heartier than regular instant oatmeals , kind cross light muesli oatmeal . i make mine , add 2 ounces organic skim milk , i'm good go . sweetness light wonderful , no overly-sugary yuckiness .	1
both my mom sister gluten intolerant , so i used many gluten free products make cakes or other recipes family get togethers . this best cake mix far .... this cake mix just good wheat-based mixes . i modify it make various kinds cakes : coconut cake , red velvet cake , etc . it always gets rave reviews , even those used eating wheat-based cakes . ( my mom sister tolerate vanilla pudding , so i add one third half box instant vanilla pudding - regular , not sugar free - per bag cake mix make it extra moist . ) i also use gluten free pantry chocolate truffle brownie mix ; it better me than any wheat based brownie mix	1

kellogg fruit harvest strawberry blueberry packs huge punch great taste it contains no fat , no trans fats no cholesterol . it relatively low sugar carbohydrates , too . despite fact this one best tasting breakfast cereals out there i am disappointed its vitamin content . artwork box leads you believe this cereal just very healthy you . yes , it 25 % your recommended daily intake iron , niacin , vitamin b12 , vitamin b6 , riboflavin , thiamin folic acid ; but i expected this product healthier still . i take off one star make this four star review . it low sugar just they say it . however , if you aren't getting proper amount exercise you need , then extra sugar strawberries , blueberries corn syrup could turn into sugar inside your body . always , when planning diet , it helps consult your physician before starting new diet . nevertheless , strawberries blueberries taste delicious -- even when you eat this dry drink milk it . kellogg fruit harvest cereal offers whole grain which important part any healthy diet . overall , kellogg fruit harvest strawberry blueberry breakfast cereal great choice start your day . sure , it may not absolute healthiest cereal your grocer shelf but this cereal beats junk food mile . buy some enjoy today ! smile	1

price this product ( many others ) via amazon excellent compared " whole paycheck " types " healthy " supermarkets . i'm totally pleased this cereal . it tastes great , but surely sugar content boosts its taste appeal . organic or not , sugar sugar , many advised keep their distance it . nature path should consider using alternate sweeteners , such , organic course , brown rice syrup or raw blue agave syrup . macrobiologists would jazzed	1

i long time lover black licorice dark chocolate . but since recently discovering rjs , i would say , if given choice piece best dark chocolate piece this licorice , hands down i'd going latter . i astonishly surprised my first bite - wonderfully soft intensely flavorful . i enjoyed fact it didn't stick me teeth or make me feel i give my mouth workout enjoy it . amazon offers this great price too . i've paid considerably more	1
i purchased this candy my father my father-in-law . they both thought it some best licorice they ever tasted . they liked fact it soft easy chew but outstanding characteristic flavor . both them could not stop talking natural , " old time " flavor candy . i think they disappointed if i don't buy it again	1
i old , rather beat-up percolator i bought $1 neighbor lady during garage sale . it terrific . easy make coffee , coffee tastes great it takes up little counter space . but i would get these grounds my coffee cup , i didn't like it . enter percolator filter ! these great , because grounds really no where go . my grocery store used carry ( but stopped , which isn't good ) disc filters , which just sit under grounds , but don't wrap around them any way . so grounds still sneak into my cup ( though it better than nothing ) . also these make disposal easy . just tip your percolator basket thingie ( i percolator but am clearly not expert them ) upside down , filter falls out you ready pot joe . thank you , melitta	1

though i'm not into so called " guilt-free " foods eat mainly fruits , vegetables , whole grains , beans low-fat dairy , i days when i need make sure i get enough protein pinch . these soy chips often fill gap , new baby house ( who cared full time his mom lieu various mechanical other devices such swings , bouncers , teddy-bears womb sounds , etc ) i'm not cooking quite so much . plus , i don't much taste meat , though i'm not vegetarian . i don't eat many processed foods , these soy chips lower end processed side things , my opinion , they don't bunch dyes , perservatives , etc , just soy flour , rice , oil , salt , spices ... one could much worse . particular , i found them helpful road trips when you don't know when you'll encounter something decent eat ( don't room cooler ) plane trips . few pieces fruit , i've carried through many dicey food situation these non-perishable soy chips . 2 hour ride airport , 2+ hour flight average 2 hour luggage retrieval dash hotel or other lodgings long time go without something eat these days superb airline service . besides , who ever really liked , or much less could argue sound nutrition airplane food anyway ? chips pack lot heart healthy soy protein ( 24 grams per 385 calorie bag ) , low fat sugar . also , bag compressed much smaller size carry-on economy if you don't mind some crushed chips . they may not salad healthy entree cover page meal , but they giant leap up vast majority vending machine , convenience store , grocery snack aisle trash . downside them they relatively high sodium , but if rest your diet pretty low salt you aren't trouble blood pressure , you're probably ok there . i really love new amazon.com grocery venture because one , i get these soy chips 12 packs . price works out just over 50% cost per bag i'd pay any grocery store where i live . when i two cases time get over $25 barrier , i get free shipping which really seals deal . my dad kids me i'm amazon.com junkie whenever he sees package amazon.com his box , he knows who sent it . this not prompted plug amazon , i just really like their service , grocery especially	1
