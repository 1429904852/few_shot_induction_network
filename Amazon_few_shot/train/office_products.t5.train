i bought small one these blank , unlined pages pocket sketchbook . pocket sketchbooks commonly sold art supply stores one two varieties , either wire-bound or stitched . thing , wire-bound notebooks uncomfortable back pocket ( i just don't like feel , bumping up against ridges wires edge ) , most stitched bindings don't fold well moleskine ( folding nice wide so there plenty blank page use ) . honest , i may've fallen just little pompous tripe sketchbook great artists . thing , paper terrible . all ' bloggers geeks i've heard raving these notebooks use them their laundry lists or their ideas write or god knows what . while i'm not best artist around , i minor fine arts school , so i'm not completely clueless . so take my word ( or don't; it your loss ); paper just plain bad . most drawing paper some degree " tooth " -- roughness paper , which rubs off your graphite or charcoal smoothly onto page . tooth these sketchbooks nonexistent . rather than describe more detail paper , however , i believe i give apt description two words . manila folder . that what paper these books like , so nearly indistinguishable ( slightly smoother , fact , than manila folders -- even less tooth ) . while paper quality something personal preference , i've never seen anyone use any paper remotely similar this drawing , so i question claim these pads identical those used picasso et al . positive note , binding great , covers great , elastic strap , bookmark ribbon , back pocket all great features . but when it comes down it , i care most paper quality . if you want just write , get one these . if you intend any serious drawing , don't bother .	-1
this great address book , but you should know price coming out factory $9.95 , not higher prices cited this listing	-1
poor communication . i notified printer not coming when they said it would , but never given date . after waiting some time i cancelled order said i ordered one someone else . i guess they don't read their email either . next day they shipped item . now i two , but am not going spend $20 ship it back them . believe me i would never buy this company again	-1

throughout years i used owned many different versions brita pitcher water dispenser . all these filtered water containers great . only complaint i ever these filters size . brita ultramax water filter dispenser supposed answer this problem . unfortunately due bad design , it introduced multitude problems never existed past brita products . pro : size : this water dispenser definitely hold lot water . ( ironically , this really disadvantage ; you find below . ) con(s ): mold : if you not let this filter dry within maximum two days , you get mold . this mold probably make you ill ( sore throat ) ( conversely if you look it point view - it strengthen your immune system ) . avoid this problem , water dispenser should washed every week very least ( safe you should wash it more often ) . i never this problem brita other products ( i friends who never washed their brita pitchers months , there not even slightest sign mold when they wash it ) . left over water : due faulty design product , there left over water both above filter below it . besides turning product upside down , you cannot dispense all water . this just stupid hints lack quality assurance testing this product . not surprisingly , this helps further contribute mold growth . conclusion : save your money buy brita other well designed pitchers or even pure pitchers . ( key word pitcher . ) you only waste time possibly your health this poorly designed product	-1
planner nice , but i charged $6.25 shipping ! rip off !!	-1

this got most poorly manufactured item i bought long time . six plastic deviders either cut too short so they wont fit into both groves spanning opening , or bowed arc shape . so my 31 day monthly organizer now 16 or 17 day organizer . you would think someone would check quality something they going attach their name too sell	-1

i purchased this mount hang 15 " lcd tv , weighing less than 9 pounds ( specifications rate it up 33 lbs ) . i carefully measured used level mount swing arm wall , but when i hung tv , position arms small amount " give " arm segments caused tv hang slight , but noticable , angle . you tighten arm segment joints , which helps problem somewhat , but you won't able swing arm around once tightened . swivel adjustments only allow you change side-to-side angle vertical tilt , there no way fix rotation set .	-1

i'm very disappointed this shredder . i got it back october 2006 , i only used it 3 or 4 times . first all , although product supposed shred up 5 sheets time - it not . it get jammed , so i only shred 1 or 2 sheets time . tonight i used it again , it became completely jammed few sheets . i cannot get it work again . it very loud bit slow , but i live , i just don't like fact it jams after only using it few times . i recommend others spend few extra dollars get reliable shredder , unlike royal " 5-sheet " crosscut shredder ht500x	-1
we royal 8 months , used it sparingly made sure not overload it it stopped working . we read reviews prior purchase it recommended then find other reviews now support our experience . stay away this shredder .	-1

i beat hell out everything i own . my pda which this partially replaced aluminum hardshell case metal body . i broken just every watch i ever owned ( i have/had few excellent watches ) . i am naturally hard things due my focus life not my gear . this little notebook kept itself together so far , while looking very hip . i am software engineer/project manager am cognisant my technological options , this just faster , lighter thinner than my pda scribbling notes . i am never without it office . back folio pocket elastic strap looked dumb when i first bought it . however , i use folio pocket receipts reimmbursed ( better than leaving them pocket washed or thrown out)and elastic strap serves double duty second bookmark keep notebook together ( keeping it closed helps it survive ) . i like construction archival quality book . my notes look more like those disorganized madman than manager ( i am starting wonder if they synonomous ) but if i ever refer back them i assured they there long time . it only received 4 stars because they [ ... ] piece my current scrawling rate , i probably need 4 or 5 year . just get your company pay it if you , because they notebooks you rely there long while . lastly : person who likes their montblanc notebook tear out pages , they partially missing point . these books archiving keeping records ( questionable usefulness my case ) not making quick throw away notes . i also highly doubt their notebook thin one these either . each their own place	-1
this book many others attempt duplicate but simply cannot . addition cool little features like elastic band ( keeps book closed when stuffed full other found items papers ) , pocket back durable cover this very well made book . student book making , this classic piece . most books nowadays form " perfect binding " where pages just glued spine . needless say this non-archival non-durable it gets . moleskine they classic way : pages folded sewn together signatures then sewn binding . they last forever , which why we still sketchbooks around likes van gogh , etc . overall great choice , i recommend it constantly	1

i write noodler black ( brand " standard " black ink ) almost every day because i can't always choose paper write . noodler black used two-sided writing bad paper , even newsprint , which rare among all fountain pen inks world . i also write noodler black because it waterproof , forgery-proof , good-looking , pleasantly smooth during writing . i confidently write checks noodler black , it safe signing valuable or important documents too ( when black acceptable color ; ask your lawyer ) . please keep mind noodler company carefully says which brand colors waterproof which not . my experience noodler black far best noodler color writing both sides bad paper . one behavior you might notice , if your pen nib exposed metal surface ( not covered colored enamel ) , noodler ( standard ) black spreads itself over exposed metal surfaces . this " nib creep " harmless behavior because ink doesn't run down onto grip area . wiping ink off nib only temporary ; more ink soon spread replace what you wiped off . again , this harmless behavior very small price pay security your marks , signatures important handwritten texts	1

( whole sheet transfer , i first iron around transfer set it down ; then i press increments three inches five long seconds , all way across , making four or five rows presses get top bottom , then start all over again going up down , making four or five rows presses get one side other . i press lift , rather than pushing . when i'm pressing , i move iron kind circular pattern all around transfer again , pressing firmly . then i lift up one edge peel it back ways check tranfser . if it looks good , i warm it up again where i'm going peel , then start peeling , let iron follow me so transfer doesn't cool down i'm peeling so i don't get shiny edges . phew what pain ***.) anyways , just when i really got hang it , my supplier let me down i couldn't get my professional paper time weekend . so i went back hp , using same technique . it burned first time , so i set iron half number under what i it set before , didn't iron it quite long . it looked really good , but i wanted see if transfer strong enough , so instead waiting , i threw it right washer ( inside out , cold water , no bleach ; knits-delicates setting dryer ) . i surprised how soft it ! i couldn't even tell it transfer , color good ! so it wasn't hp problem initially , it me . if you're gonna use this stuff ( or any iron-on transfer ) , best thing i tell you experiment old shirt . try hottest setting first , turn it down if it burns . ( you'll know you've burned when you see something like tea stain your shirt , it feels bit fuzzy , you'll see part your graphic left behind transfer paper when you peel it off - i think that because instead ink going into shirt , it burns back into paper . ) sure count seconds make sure every inch transfer gets even , hard press . i found cracking mainly due iron not hot enough , not pressing down hard enough . polymers gotta sqooshed into fabric . also , i iron onto nice smooth piece wood , i don't use pillow case or anything shirt wood , i stretch shirt very slightly tuck it so it doesn't move when i iron . then i let shirt cool down slowly , before i take it off wood ( thinking if it cools down too fast , might make it crack more ) . before i got new iron , i ironing piece sheet metal top wood conduct heat . better , but new iron , getting temperature right , ironing hard evenly , trick me .	-1

what it : this " charmin ultra bathroom tissue " very soft , absorbent , long lasting , terrific value . shortcomings scott standard mainstay , roughness , not concern here . " charmin ultra " nearly perfect every way . new " gold standard " bathroom , arguably become " charmin ultra " especially if your needs require softer tissue than scott . scott standard bathroom tissue stronger than charmin ultra , but " charmin ultra " strength ample intended use product . 2-ply construction makes 200 sheet rolls go much farther than one might expect add body mass product . add this extra absorbency " charmin ultra " over scott , i would say " charmin ultra " clear edge . bottom line : basically , these two products compare much like " bounty " versus " viva " paper towels . while both products score high marks every area there significant differences . bounty stonger viva softer , making both choices excellent but dependent needs individual consumer . results our in-house trial this charmin " scott extra soft " : we compared " charmin ultra " " scott super-soft " what turned out no-contest event . " charmin ultra " much softer than " scott extra-soft " , though " scott extra-soft " improvement over their standard product , but still quite rough .

i've recently swapped sitting desk ( which i nearly 20 years ) working " stand-up " desk . i found standing office carpets , even while wearing comfortable shoes , tough - i would barely last 5 10 minutes . accumulative effects enough i doubted i would get acclimatized anytime soon . tried this mat week now , i found i stand it 20 minutes or more time straight away . even end 20 minutes my feet don't feel bad - i am just sitting point because i am sick standing , not because i sit . rather than move mat out way , i am allowing my chair roll over it . it not conducive rolling ( high chair i don't leverage move it much even normal carpet - mat i no hope ) . when i move chair away , i see definite indents mat where wheels , however these spring back within 5 minutes or so . this excellent purchase far i am concerned	1
well , it sounds funny , but it sure pretty . i wanted make my own beads because some i purchased making jewelry lost their outer coating turned white ! these glass beads .... i found sculpey ordered 10 pack see how it would work . colors beautiful clay holds its shape , mixes well marbling blends form additional colors . make your creations permanent , just bake them your oven low temperatures . easy this , sculpey baking instructions ( use glass , 15 minutes per 1/4 inch , etc ., ) little too specific my taste . beginner , i find it troublesome some things i am baking may thicker than others therefore undercooked , or thinner ones may burn if i try compensate , so i bake them separately ? @ ! * ! or what ? i notice old handers just seem lower temperature cook everything 30 minutes . i'm not brave yet . but so far , nothing burned nothing turned back raw clay so i must doing something right . or sculpey more cooperative than its makers know .... i'm actually quite proud some my beads now , i've if less than month . sculpey get you off good start too	1

former kgb agent formerly stationed former czechoslovakia , i can't tell you how useful moleskine city notebook : prague would me back when i junior agent just beginning my career former prague bureau . i remember one time i supposed tail dissident his way meet his cia contact . i followed guy over charles bridge towards old town , but then lost him crowd near town square . i went back bureau shame-faced , but my understanding superior told me write up detailed report what i saw where . i sat down write report , i realized without accurate map or detailed notes , i could not reconstruct what i witnessed , so i made something up . i ended up making up many my reports , mostly due my poor organizational skills . if i my maps notes one , compact convenient notebook , i might saved myself lot trouble . my understanding superior became much less understanding when he found out i writing fiction , soon i found myself noril'sk , siberia , north arctic circle , where i seen people eyeballs freeze their heads . after soviet union collapsed , i packed my things left kgb , but idea revisiting prague never left my thoughts . this time , however , i plan my moleskine city notebook : prague me , you sure whatever notes i write nothing dissidents or defectors , everything best restaurants , oldest architecture , warmest hotels prague offer	1
