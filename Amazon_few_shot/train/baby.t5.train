i'm not certain why there so many glowing reviews this product . my wife registered this item because 4 stage tub looked good theory . unfortunately , because collapsible design this " bath " tub not hold water , it just runs out seam where two sides come together . there foam gasket around seam intended hold water , but it useless . sling useful bathing infant , removable ring it job keeping infant upright while learning sit . unfortunately , time our infant ready sit we already replaced this piece junk . i guess they call it safety 1st your kid can't drown dry bath tub	-1
this high chair great start , but after while tray table would come loose one side during meals . i thought it me , first , not latching it correctly but we soon realized it my 9 month old releasing clasp . reluctant change chairs we persevered now , 3 months later , she remove both sides entirely send tray its contents crashing floor . i am worried she either trap her fingers tray comes loose or bruise her legs tray falls ground . if you looking chair last you into toddler-hood your child learns quickly , don't buy this one . i am looking replacement before my daughter hurts herself	-1

i bought this because i love all other fisher price aquarium stuff we . but ... we haven't thrilled this tub . hammock only used until baby 10 lbs if i'm remembering correctly -- well our child over 9 lbs birth ... so she used it like 2 weeks . even so , hammock sags onto this hard bump middle hammock so baby back rests this bump . never seemed comfortable . then we used it hammock attached only top like instructions say but our daughter outgrew infant side because her butt would slide right over bump supposed support her but she can't sit up use other side . there better tubs out there	-1

i bought this my 4month old christmas , i liked pretty , bright colors sounds foot pad would make .. she little small when i put her , but nothing thin blanket tucked around her support wouldn't fix , pillow under her feet . she wasn't heavy enough yet push foot pad make noise , all those things she would grow into though . part i couldn't over look though how close all toys her head how hard toys . she tried chew see-saw ( teething , everything goes mouth ) it too hard hurt her gums so crying she jerked her head back bumped it mirror behind her . it pitiful sight . poor baby . i don't know why they didn't allow just little more tray space curved silly bar out more so they wouldn't bump their heads . i think little more thought put into product it could great toy , but it now i think it just little too " rough around edges " . i took mine back store then bought evenflo , she fits it much better so far she loves it .	-1

okay , starters , i look various other reviews thought i would take my chance . it seemed good outweighed bad . until ... i bought it am trying install it ( we speak but got irritated so am taking break write this . ) where begin , locking mechanism seems fine if you get it install first place . however , manufacter only includes screws wood walls . which mean , if you dont wood walls you go buy other screws ! i drywall screws not reliable . second , i bought this gate extension ( 24 " , only one there ) because top my stairs measure 44 1/2 inches . this gate supposed fit extension . it doesnt . i tried over hour get it fit it doesnt fit even extension . it would without extension however there 5 inch gap wall bolts each side bolts all way unscrewed also . needless say if i want this gate work , i go my local hardware store buy new hardware so this mount securly or i take it back store find something else . unless i figure out way make it fit how it , this gate waste my time my money . only reason i gave it 2 stars because im sure it would just fine if i wood walls it fit where i install it . now i holes my wall confussion trying figure out how make it fit if its all possible . doesnt look like it though .	-1

i purchased this rail today my daughter crib " converts " into toddler bed . everything outside box looked great , until we got home , put it together put it crib . there only 6 inches space my daughter climb out bed . also it sits 3 inches which significantly reduces amount sleep space . after playing it awhile , i decided look over instructions again . it states warning section this rail only bed box spring mattress not intended crib or toddler bed . my question " why didn't it say this outside box ?!

i read reviews this decided despite some negative comments give it try since it so cheap .... first i impressed this shade because it attached quite easily my stroller actually provided shade my baby ( although not much it looks like it would - his legs never protected sun even though it looked liked they would because shade so big ) . my stroller pretty typical stroller , nothing special or comlpicated it . but yes , it flip up wind or even small breeze very easily i weigh it down which didn't really work because it so flimsy . after 2 weeks it lost its shape completely front it flipped up no longer provided coverage all . piece junk .	-1

well , i just tried bundle me ( toddler size ) my 20-month old our jog stroller first time today i am disappointed because it definitely already too small . he really can't sit bag unless his legs bent , which he hates . plus , when i bag pulled far down possible stroller ( only way i get him all ) , then it only zips just above his waist -- definitely not high enough really get warm snuggly . i'll keep bag baby #2 , but i'm really disappointed i can't use it my not quite 2-year old .	-1

price this cradle/swing , i'd hoped lot more quality reliability than i got . first , stand seemed little wobbly -- you really need make sure feet wide possible when setting it up they don't lock into optimal position . even worse , however , after less than two days use , lights , sound , mobile stopped working . calls " customer service " complete waste time i ended up returning item . while netting other features appeared attractive desirable , i'd recommend purchasing less expensive papasan cradle/swing	-1
i 3 4 year old this device little deter or prevent them raiding fridge while their mom i asleep . couple good , hard yanks your child this device fails . this might me good product infants toddlers , but if your child over 2 years old , try something else like lock release fridge latch safety 1st ( but aware even though these far superior , you'll still place 3 these safety 1st latches your fridge door keep little ones defeating them . that what worked us anyway . i'll so glad when they grow out this fridge fascination .	-1
these bags leaked me both top bottom . fold-down mechanism very cumbersome especially because plastic very stiff . i lost three bags milk due leaks . if you transport bags anywhere , like back forth work like i , i would avoid these bags . they just leaked all over place me , even after i carefully re-sealed each one exactly according package instructions . i would recommend lanisoh bags over these .	-1
unfortunately you correct - these not same premium heavyweight cloth diapers used come gerber . when i called company ( i use these cloth diapers my business ) ask , they told me this same product . it not . they quilt wrinkle after one washing , just don't hold up their shape general . amazon needs update their site , because packaging changed well . i miss old diapers !	-1
we used these bottles three weeks , we very skeptical they actually work well they supposed . there some additional drawbacks well . 1 ) these leak travel . twice we've gone park 7oz , arrived 4 mess bag . 2 ) we see no difference reducing gas . while these designed take gas away collar , what all air nipple where air first enters ? this gimmic ? 3 ) flow too fast . we went bottles smaller holes less flow these , which far too fast infant	-1
i'm currently process adopting my son , i bought this take guatemala me when i visited . it never worked - it didn't matter how much water i put chamber , it would never cycle more more than 30 seconds . i then wait approximately 5 minutes it cool back down before using it 30 second cycle . i ended up filling ice bucket hot water , letting bottle sit warm up . needless say , it sent back . i think i'll just use microwave when baby gets home - it got easier quicker than this thing	-1
i purchased this swing because we wanted something take back forth our parents house . though i am very sorry i purchased it . when you place baby swing- seat lays almost flat/horizontal ( foot part swing much higher than head position ?? )very weird ?? while it swings , i am afraid my daughter could end up tipping seat backwards land floor . also , there no head support . box it says it age appropriate birth 25lbs- this not case . my daughter only 4 months old she hold her head- but not too great yet there no head support this swing . my daughter ends up leaning way over one side swing- it doesn't seem support other swings . i swing head support positioning way swing sits much better . add- mobile horrible . it really pitiful hard believe fisher price put something like market . entire swing poor design it .	-1

i bought this sling when my son 8 months old 19 pounds . he hated this carrier because he couldn't turn around see world . i hated this carrier because rigid straps cut into my hips shoulder every time he tried move . seller recommended making sure straps place correctly ( i tried numerous positions . there isn't place your body where unforgiving straps particularly comfortable ) also said tighten straps so baby couldn't move around . i all these things still found it very uncomfortable wear . seller helpful product arrived promptly , so i gave it 2 stars instead 1 .

this item suggested me my local birth center . i should noticed word " wrap " , but i didn't give it too much thought . there two main problems this baby carrier : 1 . you wrap every time you want use it which problematic if you other kids who need attention if you wanting use it out house . i live sw florida where summertime it 100+ degrees . there no way i could stand parking lot , wrap myself up , put baby get my other child without suffering serious heat exhaustion . 2 . it hot . yes , this nice , stretchy breathable fabric , but , fabric much , much bulkier than standard baby carriers . again , i hate harp weather here , but there no way i could take my other child park wear this unless all i underneath tank top . i'm also unsure how you would nurse while wearing this unless you those special nursing shirts slits them . otherwise , you'd jack your shirt up underneath baby carrier feed them . plus side , it easy get wrapped up easy put baby doll out .	-1
i bought this wipe warmer weather got colder here georgia so far not impressed . two problems . 1 ) wipes stay warm . 0042 secod so time you pop them out get them your son tushy they lukewarm best . 2 ) they advertise how intelligent their top warming design it , but that only wipes touching top product . once you get half way through your wipes , there isn't any way those wipes benefit warming device ( placed directly below lid ) since they cannot reach it . they should install some sore spring device so all wipes touching warmer no matter how low your wipe supply getting . i continue use it but wish i though more product design	-1

we first original diaper champ , which i would given 4 stars . it kept odor pretty well , easy use , used regular trash bags ... etc . we really liked it until one day velcro tab diaper pulled foam out lid . since it letting odor out , we decided replace it new improved model . worst diaper pail ever . soon diapers start piling up , lid grabs tabs , wipes , etc jams top so you can't flip it . i spent so much time shaking , wiggling kicking thing i very quickly exasperated . when you flip top , it created much bigger gaps two sides than older model . this why things get jammed ... also why it lets huge waft diaper odor out every time you flip it . horrible	-1

we bought this our son after experiencing some dirty or too large public toilets . my husband tried use it first time yesterday could not get it fit toilet restaurant there no way he could lift my son it without it slipping . i thought i would give it try today when we out breakfast . typical toilet einstein bagels . i hard time getting it stay , lifted my son up placed him seat . he let out horrible scream i lifted him up threw seat cover floor . he bleeding . primo folding potty seat cut him his behind !!!!!! this product not fit toilets , handles blocking where legs should go instead protecting him , it hurt him . we just bring disinfecting wipes now . not buy this !!!	-1

when i learned i expecting triplets , i bought large inventory these bottles which i thought best out there . boy , i wrong ! these bottles leak , not just once while but almost every feeding . i am constantly " double checking " them hopes they won't leak all over my babies . i now cover my babies cloth diaper so they don't get soaked when - surprise ! - bottle leaks all over them . yes , i've read directions no , i don't over tighten bottles . you can't take them you feedings go since they leak all over your diaper bag or cooler bag . they especially leaky when i prepare bottles advance store them refrigerator . there something cold or condensation affects seal . bottle must disassembled , top wiped dry then reassembled . lots fun three bottles - especially 3 am feedings . even if i am doing something wrong , bottle requires this much precision assembly not leak not very good product . if i hadn't bought so many , i'd throw them all away get something else . take it someone who using these bottles three times often - they waste money source constant aggravation	-1
i purchased this seat because safety factor consumer reports reported . comparing seat graco snugride , however , i am very disappointed tough , very dense foam low back/sacral region seat . foam goes down certain point baby low back , then disappears , leaving dip baby buttocks . just imagine sitting recliner support only down low-back region ( buttocks not supported ) ... not comfortable . i wonder how baby backside would stand up traumatic jolt seat ... well , i'm not going take any chances . baby trend should consulted physical therapist ( like me ) before designing this seat .	-1

i purchased dr. brown bottles after birth my boy/girl twins hopes helping my son his gasiness . they help ease his suffering but he also put soy which seemed help most . this point , both babies become attached these bottles wouldn't use anything else . first i thought i must doing something wrong them continually leak , sometimes pour out rim bottle . ( i total 4 kids through lots different types bottles , none this bad ! ) we tried everthing stop leaks - * using only all dry parts each new bottle*not heating or storing fridge valve stem inside*not overfillingafter entire year frustration these leaking bottles i noticed when my son would hold it nipple or squeeze nipple , milk would come pouring down sides ! finally , answer leaks !!! truly great idea i hope they try perfect it , but these major design flaw - babies drenched formula middle night no fun . these items meant baby use , price it should help make babies ' mom life easier . stick avent or playtex liners . thank you good luck	-1
i loved gate . so when i moved my new house found doorways wider than gate , i needed extension . it well worth it . my daughter always pulling it hanging it , it still stays very sturdy within doorway . i am also happy we got re-use hands free gate because i would hated fasten gate right onto wall make holes my wall . this gate great purchase	-1
i love other sleep sacks , you see my full review them their web pages . but this sack different fabric which i really , really don't like . it isn't actually quilted . it woven look like it . material such it attracts hair lint it dryer it catches fabric so it takes bit light tugging get it off . it also catches any hang nails or rough skin . when it warm i use cotton sleep sacks when it cold i use fleece ( polyester ) ones . great sacks , just annoying fabric this one	-1
our first baby , we determined stay away lure cute but unnecessarily expensive baby items . this one few items we not research we purchased this tub thinking any tub would work . we wrong . tub too slippery which causes his head endlessly roll back forth into corners . slant tub also meant larger baby which causes his head dig into his chin which he hates . bathtime bonding , so after month half fighting , we ended up taking our baths together . my son prefered skin skin contact anyways . tub also poor fit any oval sink bathroom , one time i put it kitchen sink i filled it water it buckled . never tried it again . if you want wash your baby sink , get foam sponge or bath support specifically made newborns . even 12 dollars i would not buy this tub again . granted it might work some , but if you fussy or even mildly fussy baby i would not recommend this tub .	-1
first off , person who wrote her ingenious husband who invented trick squeezing air out before screwing top ? yeah , i'd call him creative , but not one who ' invented ' trick . i giggle myself then post this publicly ... myself my whole group friends used trick . secondly , liners too expensive , third , how world you mix formula these things ? they worked great breastmilk , but hassle mix formula seperate container then pour it into liners just too much me 3 am screaming kid . even waiting warm it up under hot running water took too long . give me regular bottles any day . ps- bisphenol-a ... what high fructose corn syrup , cargeenan ( which sludge comes soybean processing put nearly every food market preservative ) even - gasp- probability your kid might someday eat bug eaten off chemically-treated cornfield ! i'm all protecting your kids but you can't save them everything there much more harmful substances out there	-1
this product good idea however : 1 . fill hole , not large enough fill bottom dish hot tap water without getting water into serving tray . 2 . can't put micro . 3 . extremely hard open bottom compartment clean . 4 . extremely hard open close ( i my daughter use butter knife pry open ) . 5 . not good grandmother hands joint problems . 6 . doesn't keep food warm very long . perhaps going back drawing board would help this product	-1
i've used diaper dekor since birth my now 7-month-old daughter i loved it begin . very easy one-hand use -- step pedal , drop diaper through flap , very easy tie off bag when it became full . beginning , it handled odors well too ; even smelly diapers didn't cause problems . but soon i started feeding solid foods , things changed . it proved completely incapable containing ghastly stench those diapers . my daughter room top our stairs , stench didn't just fill room , it flowed out her door down stairwell , so we treated powerful whiff every time we walked upstairs . i took leaving her window open fan air out room during day emptying pail before bedtime night order prevent it stinking up house . lasted week -- i just bought new pail ( diaper genie 2 ) i hope works better	-1
after seeing latest consumer reports article infant car seats , i immediately replaced my britax companion graco snugfit . britax previously highly rated , but latest test trashed it . we surprised , becuase it first seat we owned ( our 3rd kid ) , really rock solid snug once installed . i bought graco snugfit , i nothing good say it . no matter how tight i got straps attached latch my 2006 honda odyssey , i could still flip seat up side side very little effort . now , i'm sticking britax	-1

i this when my daughter first born . it worked ok but she seemed pretty curled up it . when she 2 months old we out walking one buckles snapped -- luckily i my hand under sling she not fall out or anything . i able return product , but i bought snugli carrier instead -- i would not recommend this or any other sling plastic buckles .	-1
i three baby carriers . it seems eccessive but i never found one really doing it me . i started gracco carrier it turned out nightmare everytime i put baby inside . my son crying while i snapping all 1001 snaps it there but after he stopping crying even though he wasn't looking too confortable . when he got older ( 5 mounths ) we bought backpack carrier . this really really nice buy . we loved it so our son . problem it i wouldn't put baby younger than 5 mounths inside . so when my other son born we tried this new carrier . i think that best newborns because they don't support any body part . more over , when baby sleeps , he nice position they seem like it ( even though i though his head weird angle ?!?! ) soon baby gets heavier ( 8 or 9 lbs ) it getting bit uncomfortable mostly if you i large breast i . it slips its place so head child doesn't stand your shoulder anymore but your lower chest ( so when you large breast baby head really really weird angle ! ) . i think it doesn't worth price time you use it . now my younger son 5 mounths , i don't use it anymore	-1
i've bought this tub thinking i just fold it up store it under sink . but that not how it works . it take many steps fold unfold it , one them ivolves inflating seat ! mechanism snapping it place when it unfolded looks like it would break if it used couple times . also , plastic inflatable seat smells like all plastic inflatable things , probably not very pleasant little baby . i am returning this item	-1
we better luck than some - gate lasted 2 years before locking mechanism gave out . called customer service , they said it isn't replaceable part . too bad . it easy enough install , worked well up until it didn't anymore . click pretty loud ; we found ourselves trying close it two-handed avoid waking up baby . disappointed it didn't last long we needed gate - but my daughter only 2 1/2 i still need gate top stairs . i'l replacing it different product , obviously	-1
all other reviews , our gate worked well while then latch broke well . there no way fix it . company nothing help us situation , except suggest we buy whole new one . no thanks ! i would encourage anyone who purchased this gate send your complaints company , i am doing . though company says they made improvements product , gates still breaking should recalled . their representative told me there no reason recall gates since it not safety issue , however , they advertise its use top stairs ! i called first years , they said send your complaints : judy pauletterc2 first years100 technology center dr. suite 2astoughton , ma 02072	-1

we tried these after getting one portable mats didn't work out . this item too didn't work us . it won't stick it there table cloth . then 9 time out 10 when we would get it stuck our daughter would pull it up one hand ! it really ended up more trouble than it worth . we started carrying package cleaning wipes her bag ... we wipe down her part table really well let her it . 14 months she doesn't really make too much mess if she we just extra couple bucks tip apologize mess way out .	-1
my experience similar other reviewers . one movable positioner secures very loosely small piece velcro . my two week old daughter managed slide down positioners her face against one them when i checked her middle night . honestly , only way baby would stay this thing if they didn't move their arms ... so perhaps designers no children their own	-1

i just bought dora folding potty seat today walmart . it doesn't cover entire toilet seat . it starts front toilet , doesn't go all way back . result there no support back . my daughter 3 yrs , 4 months , this seat much too weak her . any movement she makes causes potty seat sink back . i'm afraid if we use it , it soon break she'll fall . she definitely can't sit back , or even sit straight up because it sinks so much . i'm returning it i'm going look something else	-1
before purchasing this item , please check your safety services division your state regarding use this product carseats . i purchased this item hopes keeping my newborn warm - but after i received it i told director safety services our state these items compromise integrity belts carseats . i also very hard time tightening belts carseat because openings belts not line up well . instead , i returned it purchased kiddopotamus , which shearling-lined zips but fits over carseat . bundle-me item perfect strollers , but not use carseat . while i want keep my baby warm , i think it much more important she safe secure her seat	-1
return this item . it way too small . forewarned when you order it won't fit average baby up six months . i would say it would fit up 6 weeks most !! it very cute would great addition bundleme ( cover ) , but company needs reanalyze their sizing . more disappointing pay shipping return $9 item .	-1

i wish i could give this stroller 0 stars because it doesn't even deserve one i gave it . it light stroller .. there ... only plus . where i start ... how how after using it one week wheel fell off they wanted charge me shipping replace it because i didn't reciept ( it shower gift ) after arguing their lack- luster service team proving birth ceritficate my daughter only week old long i using it , they shipped new wheel free charge ... fast forward our vacation hawaii . sun shade non existent i use light blanket draped over hood protect my baby sun . steering stinks , i spilled drinks all over me my baby because cup holder moves doesn't hold anything but small water bottle . basket hard get holds nothing easily because it so awkward . my husband i went hike came end path wasn't paved . he asked me , " you worried leaving stroller so we continue sand ? " i replied " please .... i hope someone takes this piece @8 !! 8# !!! " end story ... i wouldn't invest pliko p3 either . don't get me started peg perego car seat either ... junk !!	-1
i bought this stroller last year when it went sale local story . luckily it floor model so it even further discounted . i bought it because it lightweight , front tray , adult drink holder very stylish orange color . i looking stroller all features my full size gracco but light weight smaller put my trunk . well , after couple weeks , i changed back my umbrella stroller use my graco longer trips . here negatives i experienced peg prego aria : - poor steering . not handle quick turns . - sun shade only works direct overhead sun . - 5 point harness poorly designed . plastic hook always coming undone gets tangled . - my drink holder broke . - overpriced features quality . my positives : - nice looking- easy fold- lightweighti keep this stroller our attic now extra stroller when we company . thankfully it folds up small not take up too much room ! i would not buy peg prego again	-1
i got so excited when i saw this tummy-time mat . my enthusiasm hedged when i read water pouch needed emptied daily . if known little detail , i would not registered this mat . i must also confer neat little toys stick together - bummer . honestly , now i am skeptical any " tummy time " mat . i think my boys prefer brightly colored , patterned blanket , toys within reach , lots parent encouragement stimulate their tummy time needs . better off spending money elsewhere	-1
i registered this sling , thrilled when i received it shower gift . i couldn't wait use it . when my son 3 weeks old , i tried put him it . we both instantly hated it . its far too bulky use infant , it doesn't adjust small enough fit my frame ( i'm 5'6quot; far skinny ) . i kept it , thinking my son would eventually fit it , perhaps he got bigger i'd able wear it . wrong . i wish i'd brought it back when i could still return it . my son now 11 months old we still can't use this sling . there no way he sit it securely . he hates held but can't walk yet so i really hoping we could use this , but it still doesn't fit me , my 24 pound son isn't held safely it . he wiggle his way out less than 3 seconds . i'm expecting again , hoping i find something much better than this this baby	-1
i would given this walker 5 stars first couple weeks . walker seemed great price , it easy maneuver baby loved it . unfortunately , design terrible sounds n'lights feature . it began fading out before baby time become bored it . after much frustration trying get " " battery compartment replace it , we discovered it not designed replacement all . internal battery soldered place . once it loses it original charge , you left dismal fading off sound potentially unhappy baby	-1
got this my then newborn thought it life saver until she started soiling it months later then realized it isn't all easy get off . 8 snap straps , it hassle move crib away wall snap on/off regular basis . i realized changing crib sheet just easier . crib mattresses vinyl covered , why we need waterproof sheets anyway . i just slip off her fitted sheet wipe up any wetness off vinyl - so simple . sometimes good marketing convinces us we need useless products . way , two straps broke off wash , thank god it after i realized i didn't need this anyway	-1
i bought two these return both them because they both defective ! after few days , they started making terrible loud clicking sound when one parts moved up down . this product piece junk	-1
this way too quiet , even it loudest setting . my infant didn't benefit it all . sounds fine , not too repetative some machines , but even small room ( really small ) i found it too quiet effective	-1

aspirator no suction power only irritated my son . nail clippers not sharp enough cut newborns soft nails . i use my own revlon clipper especially since i am comfortable feel it already . thermometer sooo ... slow , i get make educated guess faster . case cute i am sure medicine droppers ok ... haven't needed those yet . but all all , i threw half this kit garbage	-1
i bought this play gym because i figured it baby einstein play gym it good ... plus reviews i read good . our local babiesr'us didn't displays playgyms so i no idea this gym would suck . i hate it !! my son only loves it cause i put other toys there . notice pictures people shared who state they love this play gym so their babies toys hanging playgyms aren't ones originally came gym . why buy extra toys ?? i paid $69 this gym ... it should come more toys . i tried return this gym tiny love comes lights , music lots toys but when i opened product original packaging got messed up i unable return or exchange . what waste money me . i received playgym my friend bought $20 my baby shower . only came 3 toys hung all these toys there my son loves too . my point you don't spend so much money playgym . your babies love anything long there lots look or if you going spend money find one lots toys so you dont ' buy extra toys .	-1
idea stroller great . however after purchasing using it , it isn't well equipped . there no cup holders , basket storage not easy get isn't even big enough hold diaper bag , let alone any bags when shopping . i also take it apart even fit it my trunk . need less say i don't even use it much b/c it too hard maneuver two kids . i wasted my money this . graco new one out looks so much better much equipped go moms like me . wish i would waited . it same price . wish i could exchanged it .	-1
i not buy these again . they tiny , thick not tapper edges . this means you see lines thru your shirts . adhesive isn't enough pads shifted durring night . i highly recommend lansinoh or medela , they cover more , thinner stick better .	-1
i got this sterilizer because avent name . my main complaint lid doesn't lock into base when closing . you use alot power it close . i place it floor stand it sides lock .	-1
i can't begin convey frustration i felt when trying use refill . i struggled 20 minutes trying slip too-tight bag over cartridge . diaper dekor works wonderfully single-use item , but $30-40 pop , it most expensive garbage outside ted kozolowski apartment . printed instructions clear -- it just they product not what it supposed	-1
i would recommend just buying one sits top toilet stepping stool . you don't clean #2 out cup you'll probably already stepping stool so your child reach sink . it really saves lot hastlemy mother-in-law i both bought this potty my daughter . ( one her house one mine . ) it hard me put together , my mo-in-law couldn't get it together all . it makes loud trumpet sound every time " water " passes sensor inside toilet scared my daughter terribly first , but luckily it took lot batteries work it died . other thing i'd like point out if your child actually likes noise batteries die , they almost impossible replace . order replace them you take almost whole toilet apart , which again very hard put back together . we got ours sale so i don't mind expenditure . when you buying these things just remember it only toilet they using year or so tops ...	-1
good thing , except spring , jumper pretty nice . unfortunately , spring most important part it not good . it low elasticity our baby not like it he push really hard get anything exciting out it . we gave it away free buy different one our new baby girl	-1
i unpacked this warmer which we received gift - not use one our first child . i got far filling removable reservoir water before i decided return it . you literally fill plastic reservoir water turn it upside down so lid reservoir , which slides , no rubber seal or other watertight implements , leak everywhere . judging other comments , i'm glad it leaked before i chance use it burn up box wipes .	-1
this wipes warmer replace one got broken our move . we use cloth wipes it burned few , smells moldy no matter what i clean it ( never happened any our other wipes warmers ) won't stay closed . it actually got so hot it melted ' moisture dispenser ' melted/burned little foamish piece it . then last night we refilled it one last time before we could head out today buy new different one leaked water all over changing table . get different warmer this one awful	-1
i bought this my baby who , 6 months barely 16 lbs . she didn't hit 20lb mark until she past 18 months old , so she rear facing long time . she loved kicking this but mirror never worked well , i could adjust it within day or two it all over i couldn't see my baby again . water seemed evaporate now just over year later hardly any water it . we can't find any leaks but there little water . little fish inside stuck together right away we could never get them back apart . sadly we just gave up it her first birthday . it never worked us mirror see her toy part , while it fun kick , just worthless . my sister law wanted one my niece but i am glad she saw how worthless mine before wasting her money this	-1
i bought these because they come foam inserts help collect leakage . i'm 38 dd use large flange my medela pump , so i too found sharp edge contacts breast cutting into my sore areola/nipple . ameda shells round edge much more comfortable , although leakage city ! my sore nipples got nearly instantly better using my brest friend ( great proper latch ! ) , treatment mild yeast infection . hope this helps	-1
this would great space-saver . . . but now gerber started using plastic tubs instead jars , we never used it all !! now gerber makes their own feeding center accommodate their tubs , i love it	-1
this great gate if you strong , healthy back always two hands available . but how many people kids both those ! it great keeping my baby room , but my 4 year old couldn't open it neither could her grandma . it made me my husband want cuss . it back box return pile . don't waste your money .	-1
i bought this seat travel my toddler found it extremely annoying difficult use . tray stuck never loosened up difficult get my child out . also , it close impossible keep clean , unless you unstrapped it took it completely apart after every use . it very unwieldy travel . it folded up , but didn't stay together so not very portable . because it so cumbersome , it ended up getting dropped laminate floor promptly broke . cheap plastic its made shattered bottom corner where side seat fit , so now it garbage where it belongs . i only owned it five months used it barely three times month average . yes , it cheap , but they say , poor man buys everything twice , now i'm out fifteen dollars buy booster .	-1
exactly 3 months after i bought this stroller , bracket back holds bars together popped off , making it dangerous impossible use . luckily i bought extended warranty receive full refund ( in-store warranty expired just 3 days previously ) . when i tested stroller store , i thought it seemed very flimsy felt it wouldn't last long ( which why i bought warranty ) , but idea such great stroller why i decided take chance . pros stroller : very light , compact easy fold ; easy maneuver ; great tall people like me--don't hunch over reach handles . there some nice little things too , like ventilation back , headrest , cup-holder , reclining position . cons : only rated carrying children under 40 lbs each seat ( didn't know this when i purchased it) -- i 35 lb . 2 y.o. newborn , so we don't exceed limit there , but my 42 lb . 3 1/2 y.o. can't use it . canopy doesn't cover kids well shade ( only face -- that big deal when living southern az -- or if it raining) -- when seat reclined ( my newborn ) canopy doesn't even cover her head ( i clip blanket drape it over ) . my 2- y.o. practically too big it -- her head extends above top seat . finally , general construction stroller not sturdy . overall , this could great stroller , but it just not sturdy -- obviously not , it broke -- but one would expect brand name " jeep " it would built better . we only use it walks going out , no off-trail stuff -- we used it 10 times before it broke . my umbrella stroller i bought 6 years ago still going strong -- why can't they make this just well-built ? i would love this stroller if it just built better	-1

i used graco metrolite stroller , i really liked it . however , i gave it relative because it went infant travel system . i bought used jeep liberty stroller , thinking it would upgrade , boy i wrong . i simply list things i not like : 1 ) it quite bulky when folded , especially compared other strollers i've . 2 ) it heavy , awkward carry , there nowhere apparent grab it . handles ? i don't see any . 3 ) all 3 tires went flat . my local bike shop charged $30 replace them all ( your mileage may vary ) . 4 ) my daughter not interested steering wheel since battery previous owner left it corroded , sounds didn't work so i can't comment those . 5 ) it creaks when you push it . i'm not sure where sound coming but we oiled wheels it still creaks . 6 ) mp3 player , which " cool factor " only reason my husband prevented me getting rid stroller , these small speakers near baby head , so order really hear music if you're playing music you like , you turn it up . volume doesn't go very high . same money , you could probably buy some portable powered speakers clip them stroller .	-1
ok , this chair fine except two very important things . one : tray huge , not good way , really hard clean maneuver kind way . also , two trays fit top , dishwasher safe , too big fit dishwasher !!! so what point ??? two : it little thing separates legs tray , rather than chair ... making it impossible set down anywhere when it full food your baby yelling get out chair . everything else , chair great , but you find these other features just any other high chair . i'm bought one that made famous toy maker , love it	-1
this item misleading because it runs very small . i am pre-pregnancy size 6 i ordered s/m size based waistline ..... wrong ! i am my 35th week pregnancy this thing barely would fit around my lower abdomen . not only it run small , but it also fold wrinkles anytime i move so it not much help . if you shorter or petite , waistband very wide back ill-fitting ( not conform curve your spine ) . it definately made taller , longer-torso women ( aka 6 ft . models ) . i would go type support if given chance	-1
i am so disgusted i woke 5am black friday drive 12 miles walmart purchase dora toddler bed . i held dora toddler bed until christmas , when christmas eve i went put it together pieces package wrong i unable assemble bed all . i ended up returning bed , exchange fr nothing . i found out they no longer carry bed .	-1
my son , who used using wood stool ( 8 " tall slick wood feet ) fell climbing up this because top ( foot area ) too small it tipped him ! it only 6 " wide top . not much room clumsy toddlers turn around . if you push it toward toilet there nothing left child stand . if you leave it out , then it takes up more room arc design waste . getting down he also started fall because it such narrow top . his feet still dangled he sat toilet - not coming near top this 8 1/2 " tall stool . this advertised 10 " tall ( actually 8 1/2 " ) 14 " long ( correct , but top surface only 11 1/2 " ) 10 " wide ( also correct but again , it only 6 " wide top)the rubber feet great non-skid purposes , but that only positive thing i say this .	-1
i purchased this gate thinking would perfect high traffic area . i totally wrong !!! every time you walk through swing gate you readjust it , which makes impossible open close one hand . forget it if you get through hurry , ' cause it needs readjust open close it . plus gray bumper mine loose , so if i get top bracket fit correctly , bottom one lose not secure . i get my hands knees readjust it correctly so i close it , only go through same readjusting hassle few minutes . i would returned this gate , but i trashed box before i installed it	-1
i tried this my newborn i think this product unsafe not sturdy . base seat very wobbley , it would help suction cups bottom . you fill your tub half way order your child stay warm . also , when i put my baby seat he 12 lbs , seat tipped backwards . i imagine it would worse when my child heaviear moves around more . i not think this product safe . it would make great product if they included baby tub it . so i returned product ended up 4-in-1 bath station safety first worked well my first child	-1
i loved this item face value - it looks good , materials good quality , it feels secure , premise functionality bed what i wanted because i planned breastfeeding my newborn wanted her close . i proud my purchase showed it many my friends before baby came . well , " mattress " comes it so hard my baby won't sleep it . she won't nap it , when i put her down all she cry . i've tried everything get her sleep this thing because it would so helpful if she would , but she won't sleep it all . i've even tried making it softer putting blankets down board mattress covering this receiving blanket i tuck sides ( something i don't want because sids factor ) doesn't even help - it still too hard surface . now , my baby sleeping bed me i can't get any sleep because i'm afraid rolling over her or her rolling off bed . if they'd just make mattress more comfortable baby , this would perfect product i'd rate it 5 , but because it virtally useless me my baby due mattress/board , i rate it only 2 stars . i'm so let down this product	-1
i really unhappy this lock . it not only kept one year old opening lid but kept everyone else house opening it well	-1
i recently purchased this booster well britax starriser booster seat ( i two cars/two toddlers infant ) . my children argue over who gets ride starriser . some reason they not comfortable parkway . my theory it too much like car seat rather than booster -- they feel " too snug " it . they even look uncomfortable it . one advantage parkway over starriser increase neck protection if they should fall asleep . if i it over , i would purchased two starrisers instead parkway . btw , i purchased britax companion my infant i love it	-1
we purchased crib , armoire , dresser w/ tower it took 5 wks this shipped us . once we received it , we opened it only find each box contained 2-3 severely cracked pieces . after inspecting them , we found dmg wasn't caused packaging but , poor craftsmanship . most pieces assembled using nailgun some nails even bent . cracking stemmed areas nailed continued all way up piece furniture . co pre drilled holes used screws instead , this would've never happended . obviously it " cheaper " use nails instead screws . we took pictures dmgs i wish i could attach them this review so you'd able see yourself . there also several areas inside crib which weren't sanded properly would real hazard little fingers b/c splintering wood . it advertised constructed hardwoods , but all actuality it pine . when you think hardwood , you expect oak or birch , not softwood like pine . tops furniture drawer fronts only pieces solid wood . everything else particle board . some solid wood pieces weren't even 1 piece wood , but 3 they glued together . we're currently trying return this product full refund . we're also shopping last minute replacement furniture w/ only 2 wks left before my due date . i would never purchase peice furniture made this company again .	-1

i got these when my son 12 months old already strong little guy who enjoyed dumping his bowls food onto his high chair tray . trying outsmart him , i purchased these hoping keep some food bowl . much my disappointment , they only stick formica countertops well . littlest one doesn't even stick . none them stays my son plastic high chair tray more than second or tw o.o upside , lids secure once shut all way ( which take little work ) , so they make great storage on-the-go finger foods diaper bag ... i haven't one leak yet , i put things like applesauce them test them . not total waste money , now i found this alternate use . they wash well , without any noticeable breakdown plastic , top rack dishwasher	-1
i agree all other reviews saying warmer burn your hands overheat bottle . especially when you only few oz bottle . water warmer actually boil when it heats up if bottle got stuck handle , it means you use your bare hands separate boiled bottle boiled handle . you end up boiled hand well . worst part it burn your love one .... not only , cooler not close well so content not really kept fresh even ice-pack frozen before placing into cooler . we switched avent warmer . little more $$ but it much better . i would not recommend this product	-1
after reading all rave reviews , we put pupsqueak our baby registry , but very disappointed when we received one gift he didn't work . we tried exchanging him one babies us , but we couldn't find one worked . so instead we exchanged him dinosaur ( i forget his name ) . our daughter loves him . since he soft we not afriad placing him her car seat her . she loves falling asleep holding onto mr. dyno	-1
i bought this carseat ( different color ) because i liked features . however , everytime i put my now 5 week old seat his head plops forward . i tried everything , putting diaper or towel around his head because headrest sucks , trying push base down so it doesn't sit up so high . you know how nerve wrecking it driving just look back see you newborn head ploped forward so bad he choking . not good graco , this carseat could not tested before . i evenflo my previous child not this problem . i am truly disappointed . anyone could tell me how make this problem go away , i am all ears . i know seat right because balance window all blue . i talked other mothers they same problem . help !!!	-1

i'm very dissappointed this expensive pump . now i'm looking one . it difficult pump if you large nipples . you buy extra sheild which costs extra . it noisy . it loses suction . milk backs up tubing gets moldy . i clean parts everyday . i contacted medela few times troubleshoot pump they eventually sent me motor ( great customer service ) . it worked few months now same problem happening . i guess it works some not others . now i'm hunt pump since i want exclusively give my baby pure breastmilk her first year .	-1
i chose this bottle system my son after reading so many great reviews , even bought one ran it through dishwasher test leaks ... no leaks ... they worked well , until recently . my son 4 months old they all leak . constantly . i fill one up put it diaper bag within half hour it empty . they aren't very durable , plastic rings actually breaking off now i'm going through struggle trying find new bottle system my son take ( i hate liners ) ... they never reduce amount air bottle all . not buy these bottles unless you want buy completely new system 4 months	-1

1 ) like others here , my charges not last more than 5 hours . beeping parent unit wake you 3am every night ( unless you leave them charger ) . 2 ) both my parent units now ( after only two weeks minor useage ) refuse connect nursery unit , beeping endlessly . " cycling " them off per prescribed ( though not well detailed ) manufacturer trouble-shooting method nothing . only logical conclusion : nursery unit apparently died not sending out signal . also : while they working i not really get hype these units generated . my home very common 1800 square feet two-story " box " type arrangement . static would become unbearable once parent unit taken downstairs ( maybe due weak or faulty nursery unit get-go ) , signal would cut out before we even got kitchen . so we either got static or no signal less than 50 linear feet nursery . poorly designed ( operator interface , controls , directions trouble-shooting ) , poorly engineered ( poor reception , enormous static , fast battery drain ) poorly manufactured ( apparent faulty parts lack quality ) product	-1

due fact you can't give 0 stars , i choose 1 , otherwise it would big fat 0 !!! we bought this mattress when i pregnant , thinking all crib mattresses same we totally wrong . couple months ago my son poked couple holes vinyl when he should napping , mind you he nothing use other than his fingers , no toys , nothing sharp , etc . well last night he wakes up crying middle night , my husband i go see what matter , find vinyl split completely side side springs sticking out . my poor little one springs poking him . after further examination , we found under vinyl thin i stress word thin , layer foam , then cardboard piece then coils . what joke ! carboard !!!! needless say i went out today bought him much better , better constructed simmons mattress . i should note my son only 17 mths old , first five months his life he never even slept mattress , so bascially he only used it 12 mths . don't waste your money .... you'll only buy one down road . take your money buy much better well known mattress your baby !!! afterall they deserve just good nights sleep we !!! mom who learned hard way !	-1

my hsuband decided i would nurse hailey her entire first year . i work school able pump twice day . i didn't like doing it school though because there wasn't space it . so i would go my car it . all i first battery pack . i would go through 10 batteries week half way through week i would loose strength/suction . once i got adapter i never problem again . we could go anywhere i would always access power including when we drove va ga . my husband would drive i would pump . it great ..	-1
this diaper pail certainly worst i used . it works ok week end first week i ready get new diaper pail . it not keep oders much all , i don't even put poopy diapers it . after week springs started constantly falling off thing inside supposedly keeps bag closed oder out so it doesn't any good . yes , plus using regular bags , but so diaper champ it also keeps oders much better than this . i'm definitely going back diaper champ ; i only bought this one because it only one my store , now i know it worth wait diaper champ mail	-1
i very excited finally recieve this stroller , but after i put it together ( which pretty simple ) , it very heavy bulky handle . i looking stroller accomodate my big 2 1/2 year-old new baby due soon . i bought this stroller sight unseen because it seemed like perfect solution . i not able load it back mt suv due size weight , it very long hard steer . anyone considering ionic color pattern may again want check it out person because silver fabric very shiney . it not accomodate my evenflo carrier either , so i would needed also purchase graco carseat . i am returning stroller amazon today	-1
if i could give it negitive stars i would ! we bought two these gates due couple very wide openings needed secured . these gates horrible very poorly designed . every time someone tries open gate , it sags pulls wood dowels out frame it completely falls apart ! we older children resort crawling over it get into living room just avoid its eminent collapse . often it collapses anyway . now my 11 month old son figured out if he shakes gate joint he pull it completely apart crawl right through . now we purchase new gates actually work replace these .	-1
hard install , ridiculously confounding installation directions , when you're , it flimsy . don't waste your money	-1
design pretty narrow . my 3-4 months baby far more under pounds product described . product tightened her so much when she it she would cry . unless you very small quiet baby , otherwise it not wise choice	-1
i love idea this product . like many other reviewer i don't regular traditional style crib . our crib converts toddler bed . this product based traditional cribs only works those styles cribs . i would love use this product protect my little when they come out one more current styles cribs , like mine .	-1
product not worth money . made bassinet very unstable	-1
i found product highly unsafe stroller . handle very flimsy , not strong enough control direction stroller . also wheels not lock properly safely . its ok car seat but stroller lot improve	-1
theory this sounds awesome , but reality comes really close useless . 1 ) " spa " nothing more than light flow water which isn't even enough create bubbles , it comes out corner pump unit so hardly any stream reach your baby2 ) shower head button nearly impossible keep pressed longer than 10 seconds , flow water very weak so not powerful enough rinse out hair . cup better job than this . 3 ) tub itself pretty decent , plateau used lay your baby seems nice comfy temperature indicator nice bonus . all all i wish we saved our money just gone normal tub , i advise anyone else same	-1
this my first amazon review b/c i feel this such junk i review it epinions didnt it listed . usually i find something junky product , but this so junky i can't anything it , i might well just washed money down drain . fabric rough , too rough new baby , hole too big tiny baby lay atop it well but bigger baby laying it even bottom tub intended unstable . seat it immediately fills up water if you even touch it , once filled it sinks . how it support baby if baby can't touch it or it sinks . you ring it out order use plastic hanger it comes b/c it absorbs so much water it way heavy convenient hanger , hanger ends up bending so much thing slips off or it looks like it going break . not easy baby hand so you leave it sitting tub while you get baby out get chance go back later . i 4 kids tried lot tubs , seats supports tub , some i disliked but none even come close uselessness thi	-1
my 2 1/2 year interested this seat right away , much more so than his small potty . however , he cries every time because small bump front not sufficient enough splash guard . he gets wet , floor his step stool all wet . clean up nightmare . it trash now .	-1
i purchased two these seats my twins over year ago when they 18 mos or so . i consistent problems both seats frequently popping out base units . sides back height positions set same levels so not problem . weight children not issue weight limit 50 lbs per specs my boys not even close . i would not recommend these seats based upon my experience them	-1
my son received bumbo seat christmas . five months age , he rolled out it laying top seat . six months age , he turned seat fell his head two different occassions . seat flat surface . he this i standing or sitting right next him . i loved this seat when he first got it . i told everyone i knew it . he two older siblings he loved able watch them play . his siblings loved him sitting seat because he their level . now , i absolutely no confidence safety this seat . it completely useless his " own body weight " not " keep baby place " advertised . seat rendered useless my home because it not safe it safer put him traditional bouncy seat or floor .	-1
i bought this item so many people said how much they loved it . i find it nightmare ! if you stand corridor monitor receiver it cuts out . it not work when charger . it not work unless there clear line two parts . what piece junk . i would no way recommend this product anyone	-1
my baby got this christmas . he 7 months old . now , couple months later , he still doesn't play it . my 3-year old doesn't play it either he loves most our other " baby " toys . this toy just not interesting . i wish my mother-in-law would saved her money or bought shoes or anything useful all	-1
it chunk plastic some bits rubber attached . effectively serves its purpose , but nearly 16 bucks ?!! puleeeeeeeease	-1
we bought this travel system because it light lifted comfortable but , chest clips so uncomfortable close , hard open , specially one goes legs , it so hard buckle unbuckle i'm afraid i'm going hurt my baby every time we close or open them , complicated align them finally buckle . fact i emergency my baby took lot time open these clips	-1
i disappointed cup holders come off too easy , they button onto car seat it isn't strong enough so when my boys try stuff their juice or water them they snap right back off . no longer attached seats because i refuse keep putting them back . i guess this seat okay , it nice plush but downside getting backless seat ( which i didn't think before i purchased this ) fact kids can't fall asleep these seats . my kids like i am sure most kids when they go drive motion knocks them right out . but because there nothing support their head neck they slump over very uncomfortable so they usually don't fall asleep unless they just really beat then i worry because i don't want them get crook their neck . i say this seat very lightweight which big change coming regular child seat .	-1
i bought this because only way my 6 week old sleep bed me . i bought this try reduce risk sids since his sleeping my bed . unfortunately , he kept moving it causing his legs go off side sleeper . once his legs went off side , his upper body would roll which would cause his face almost right against side sleeper . course this concerned me so each time i woke up , i move him again . finally , after couple time doing this , i just took him out it . this second sleep positioner i bought both worthless !!!	-1
this product pulls nothing out noses my one year old twins . we hoped it would easier than manual aspirators but it proven totally useless . unless your child nose leaking like faucet save your money get rubber aspirators .	-1
now i this chair , i'm not going replace it but i two major complaints it . our son 20 months old i still put book wrapped dishtowel seat so he comfortably reach tray or our dining table . raising height doesn't help because arms chair come up so high so far forward you can't scoot chair any closer table . chair also very large footprint -- unless you very spacious dining area it hard maneuvering around it . if i could it over again , i wouldn't buy this high chair	-1
i agree several others it very difficult clean . there so many nooks crannies . i used it my daughter hated it then tried it again when i my son it no different . my son 16 months old learning feed himself there times i not want let him practice because i dread how long it takes me clean after each meal . i went out bought inexpensive highchair without all bells whistles it works great ! now i more time spend playing him instead cleaning highchair .	-1
walker few flaws . first all toy bar front table not ideal . it too close child only few inches away child head . my son keeps bumping his forhead toybar when he riding walker ..... constantly . seat too tight crotch area seat too high , it should roomier drop lower .	-1
i saw this i thought it would great . it would keep my daughter food off dirty table catch food she drops . it those things but it hard clean . it gets pretty dirty , catching pouch , there grooves make it hard wipe mess out . i used it twice never use it again . i recommend table toppers- they disposable mats you stick table throw away when you . they stay place better , you wrap them around edge table so baby not put mouth table . i use mats crumb catcher bib walmart catches her messes better this one . her lap says clean clean up lot easier . you not worry putting dirty mat back into your diaper bag .	-1
quot ; stickyquot ; pads supposed hold organizer don't even stick , so every morning i would wake up find organizer sitting pile floor next changing table ... this absolutely no items it . organizer doesn't come any information , so i no idea if there alternate ways hang organizer or not . this great idea , but it very poorly constructed .	-1
we loved monitor first . features nice price reasonable . then , without event or explanation , it died one day we haven't able recharge one handheld units . maybe we got dud	-1
tired hearing your baby cry ? this monitor you . you'll lucky hear any sounds your baby this thing . looks like evenflo literal when they named product whisper connect . you barely hear anything full volume . i'm going return it tomorrow if i resist backing over it our car .	-1
my son 5 months old now first 4 months , monitor worked pretty well . we got bit static time time , but i would given it 4 stars . but ... one night i woke up reassure myself little green " " light saw monitor not . thinking it fluke , i turned it back , checked baby went bed . but , over course couple weeks , it became more more unreliable , turning off . it also hard turn it back . i flip switch several times before it would work . , this not battery issue , since it plugged entire time . i went evenflo website read faqs . there mention problem power light going out , but nothing monitor itself going out . needless say , we've thrown it away gotten different brand . i mentioned this my friend 8 month old other day she said same exact thing happened hers - just stopped working reliably . she bought different monitor too . both our new monitors working perfectly now less static . i wouldn't recommend purchasing this monitor until they make some changes .	-1
i read all amazon reviews but still decided go avent sippy cup since i relatively good experiences avent bottles . unfortunately , leaking real problem these cups . not only milk seem pour out sides no matter how well i try fasten lid , but it not flow easily my son when he sips . he ends up mouth full milk . so much my efforts get him start using cup . i orginally used playtex he liked well enough . i only switched because playtex valve hard clean easy tear . now , after wasting money avent , i'll go back playtex hopefully my son willing give sippy cups try . i don't usually write amazon reviews but i figured it worth it this case save someone else trouble . unless you want milk everywhere , i would definitely avoid these cups .	-1
i am so disappointed avent product just no good . short term or long term these cups not worth anything since they leak . my son cups leaked him , floor , his diaper bag car . i don't understand why anyone if they say they leaked would give this product anything but 1 star . mom enough too --- running around cleaning after leaky , unreliable products not fun especially price avent magic cup .	-1
screws come brackets so soft they strip almost immediately --- use my own , then read review below decided i'd better off just screwing furniture into wall . .	-1
i am unhappy this product . my newborn baby 22 " long weighs 7 pounds . i purchased this item after speaking rep size . i've found my son easily get his legs out bottom pouch through opening . i think if there longer strip velcro instead short square , this would prevented . he also get his arms out top . if velcro strip could larger , going more toward back side product , this would not happen . maybe my son more narrow top than some children this not problem many , but i think this would make product more useable , one size fits all . also , he long , small size too cramped . i'm assuming next size up would too wide him therefore making it impossible his arms stay inside - which happening anyway . i like product idea fabric construction , ( which why i gave it 2 stars ) but this product not work me . i recently purchased first years swaddle blanket , but issues one well . i am currently searching one fit .	-1
( 2 stars because style cool ... ) this christmas gift my husband this year our son big boy ( 19 1/2 lbs @ 4 months)and it too much carry him , his carrier heavy diaper bag everyday daycare so this seemed like perfect solution ... it ... until bag started coming apart 7 days after i received it ! i careful , i read some other reviews stitches coming apart i thought they just over filled bag ... nope ! bottle holder ripped all way down side ... you can't overfill ... there just room one bottle , isn't what it made ??? my husband really loved this bag because it wasn't ' girly or babyish ' but put $$ something hold bottle !	-1
i used this bag once when traveling then zipper completely fell off because it improperly made , then i got new bag ( customer service very nice helpful ) it huge rip bottom after only traveling it once gate checking it ( my stroller wasn't damaged ) , so i concluded it horribly made waste money , still waiting refund	-1

there no need this item . it huge inconvenience this big stiff box middle your bed . i hated wall my baby me . when i woke up nurse , i take her out it anyway . co-sleeping intuitive , naturally safe easy easy easy ... please don't spend your money this unnecessary complication natural arrangement .	-1
item sloppy looking feeling , unlike photo black ellaroo . i didn't feel baby secure she rode so low my side one could hardly call it hip . maybe i just never got it adjusted correctly but i read instructions gave it many tries . however , positive note , i refunded my money no problem . there small restock fee which disclosed up front . so , i no problem seller .	-1
i purchased peg perego aria stroller last month my 3rd son . needless say , i lots experience stroller world . this my first peg perego stroller purchase i used graco maclaren past . i using my maclaren umbrella stroller ( which i purchased 2000 when my first son 6 months old ) thought i would buy new stroller since other bit old . my girlfriend recommended aria so i purchased it . anyways , it huge disappointment . steering awful . you definately need two hands this stroller . stroller also extrememly " wobbly " . i shocked i figured such " upscale " brand would quality enough not wobble so much . 5 point restraint hard stay place back straps attached into little " envelope " type holder but it always comes out there no device actually secure it place . it bulky it doesn't fold into small compact stroller . i used this 3 times just gave it away ... what waste $$ . i'm back using my maclaren , which looks thrashed but wonderful stroller . i could kick myself wasting money . my advice you test it out before you buy it!!!(don't rely name	-1
my husband i purchased this set my first son , but going choose bottle manufacturer our second son . difficultly we experienced securing nipple ring onto base - it perfect alignment or there definately leaks , sometimes more than . it quite frustrating when you conducting late night feedings or traveling . i hope new second chose brings easier bottle feedings	-1
i bought avent bottles when i pregnant because they babiesrus " best pick " yeah right ! i wonder how many returned daily basis . aparently this company spends all their time money advertising not enough preventing their bottles leaking ! i would not recomend these bottles unless you like waisting your money	-1

i bought this product my 3 month old christmas when i went play it , remote didn't work . i everything it said it still didn't work . so , i took it back just exchanged it thinking it just faulty . when i took it out , remote it also didn't work . it says it " play " ( not try me or off ) it it short musical fanfare after you push button front then you use remote but nope . you should able control volume , song options , able switch colors music but no . it just plain doesn't work . i really want it work because it would great car but sadly , i take it back but this time i'll get my money back ...... i not suggest buying this product	-1
i bought this hoping it would help me organise all my baby diapering needs . unless you changing station ( or crib , wherever you want hang it ) slits or slots able hold it - velcro not hold it well . " shelves " bit insecure . it great idea , but just didn't pan out .	-1

we bought this mirror because swivel feature - which worked little too good . mirror kinda sticks out so every time i got back seat get baby out , i'd hit it knock it out place , so i readjust it all over again . sometimes when we'd hit bumps , it would fall become worthless . finally , my little girl arms got long enough she could reach it , it ended up breaking .	-1

this piece took forever assemble , arriving no fewer than 30 pieces . directions vague ... everything diagrams rectangle ! but actual parts aren't labeled , so you never know which 7 types rectangular parts they mean . when finished , all front slats drawers fell out anytime we moved it ... they no bolts hold them , just sit shallow slots . drawers shaky whole unit unstable . also , many holes not lined up , so i couldn't even put some bolts .	-1

idea nice warm wipe great , but product falls short perfomance . warmer designed non-popup type wipe box .

first , i agree other reviewers who say this helps their baby sleep better . i cannot deny . our two+ week old little girl seems love it seems sleep longer stretches it without waking . however , trade off better sleep not worth risk . i woke up last night find she slipped down her face right bolsters . she could easily suffocated ! this very common complaint this product ( both here amazon web site well target web site where there many parents who reporting same scary moment i ) . some reviews seem say if you real squirmy older baby true problem this product . i tell you not quite case . our little two week old tightly swaddled night doesn't move whole lot - yet she slipped down position where she could suffocated . bolsters very tight her sides so doesn't explain things either . if you choose purchase this product , please very careful it . i understand those you who infant reflux don't really choice this but i recommend you try it first daytime your infant closely supervised so you see if they likely slip down . us , we may try keep using it elevating bottom little blanket underneath but we absolutely getting rid bolsters .	-1
this product disappointment . pillow portion good theory only . baby head tends fall off edge more times than not ! so baby sleeper head hanging off top edge left or right ! wouldn't recommend , good concept , bad design	-1
hi i bought this seat thinking it would great arm extension . i so wrong ! if your tub isnt made just right then it not work seat itself not secure . there no suction cups hold seat place either . i ended up breaking arm lever off just so seat would set level tub . but i since purchased aquababy seat ring love it . it suction cups bottom release lever also toys front so baby play . so if you searching bath seat i dont recommend safety 1st all	-1

i tried put this oven " lock " my oven . unless you lots space your cabinet your oven unit you trouble even getting this thing stick . i finally fenagled it into place , sticking first piece side oven , then applied part goes across front latched it place . upon opening oven door very , very , very little force ( i just barely cracked door open ) latch teeth snapped open , if latch wasn't even there . tried several times , even sort holding teeth , no luck . trash it went . i also tried lock also safety first seems like it would work great - it heavy duty hinge , but half lock adhesive surface too short so there not enough length adhesive edge adequately anchor it your oven still hinge lock place - hinge locks place less than 90 degree angle . so this left latch anchored only 1/4 " adhesive strip oven . pop - off it came when i tried open door . trash it went well . i'm very concerned oven safety my little guy completely disappointed options out there ovens . :	-1
i inherited this product my neightbor last week . i attempted wash clean it thoroughly before using it . i cannot get seat apart it incredibly dirty moldy inbetween seat swivel part . other reviewers noted similar experiences but their seats broke when they tried take it apart . i would love try this product , but long it dirty cannot cleaned properly , it not used . what shame ... baby products should made so they clean up easily	-1
colors very diferent , they supposed blue , yellow white , i recived pale yellow . material not very good . i don't recomend this product .	-1
even though i think this very good idea ( no mess clean up like there roaming stand-alone potty ) , ring doesn't fit our toilet seats well . we oblong seats , not round ones , ring slides back forth , especially when my 2 yr old daughter tries get up it . it doesn't make her feel very stable so , so far least , she refused use it	-1
i very disppointed this product . i found it great containers would easily stack freezer , but this only good quality . i throw out all my containers because they leaked plastic obviously leaching . you could smell plastic milk . i'm not going expose my baby extra chemicals , especially when her liver isn't developed enough fully detoxify them . i really wanted love this product , but leaching plastic leaks not acceptable option	-1
they messy when they opened . i get milk my hands they cost way too much . i don't much room my freezer . when you buy refills you purchase tops containers seperate ... it like $17 ten : -	-1

this mirror really isn't worth money . you'd better off just buying plain mirror baby look you look baby , that all this thing . remote control pointed directly mirror , kinda hard driving down road . also , music isn't very loud , atleast not loud enough get baby attention when upset , which what i hoping . lights aren't very bright . really can't see they even light up unless it very dark out . also , positioner works fairly well when baby facing backwards , but once you turn baby around attach mirror back front seat , it doesn't stay place well . you could spend alot less money just plain baby -in-sight mirror	-1

we finally broke down spent money jumperoo happy we . we limit time our son spends it because he'd jump hours end if we didn't limit him 5-10 minutes day . jumperoo sturdy construction , 4 settings useful . i bit concerned coils inside fabric because i afraid our son would get his fingers pinched when he held it , but he fine . he doesn't play toy attachment . i think this much safer alternative jumpers hang door frame	1

i orignally bought this hold all my babies bath things . it got too heavy everything wouldn't fit . so now i use it hold his baby tylenol , etc . it really nice .	1
when my third child born , we got this tub . it best yet us . infant stage now 6 months old , my daughter fit snugly . infant , sling perfect because you can't immerse baby while stump still attached . we used tub counter bathroom sink , which worked very well while she hammock stage . once her stump fell off , she able control her head well , we lowered bottom half hammock into tub let baby bottom rest nook created hump top part tub . perfect angle baby rest comfortably while getting bath . this position which we currently use our tub . now , however , we bathe her aquarium tub instide bathtub so we don't worry where water lands . finally , once baby old enough sit without support , we'll remove sling altogether let her sit wide end tub play during bath time . no doubt our daughter enjoy this final transition short weeks ahead	1
my son loves these blocks . we've also purchased number blocks go this set . he loves saying colors , numbers stacking them	1
i got this when my daughter 4 months old . she would sit it 5 minutes , then want get out . but now she 6 1/2 months , she loves this stays it 30+ minutes just entertains herself . she great coordination now she loves smack grab toys , she coos little sun loves pull everything put it her mouth . when we go family functions or just someone house , we always grab entertainer . it very easy break down put right back together ( if it doesn't fit car ) . this far best toy she enjoys learns . she quite tall her age , 27 1/4 inches we still 2 more height adjustments this . this best $$$$ we spent so far	1
we finally broke down spent money jumperoo happy we . we limit time our son spends it because he'd jump hours end if we didn't limit him 5-10 minutes day . jumperoo sturdy construction , 4 settings useful . i bit concerned coils inside fabric because i afraid our son would get his fingers pinched when he held it , but he fine . he doesn't play toy attachment . i think this much safer alternative jumpers hang door frame	1
this monitor best sound quality you put radio monitor listen recever , it sound like radio next you . i monitor 2 year out problems range or interferance . my monitor same channel all time . i try three other monitors one them digital . sony sound quality untouchable . very sensitive , i hear my baby move night . i no problems range ( i work out basement during her nap ) . it best volume ( i hear her over loud treadmill music ) . i happy return other monitors get this one . one problen i found monitor recever not close each other because it make horrible loud noise . avoid this i turn off monitor before getting close room baby sleeping . water resistant feature great , i put recever right shower listen or watch lights . it not waterproof !!!!!!!! you don't want get it wet !!!!!!, but humidity or little splashing won't hurt it	1
my husband i adore this monitor . it picks up every little noise our little one makes which great . we occasionally get some interference , but all i move monitor it goes away . interference never occurs unit my baby room , just parent unit so you not worry waking little one up . i love rechargeable battery option ability carry around unit me throughout our 2 story house . i plug it night my bed it then runs all day long ! you defintely trust this monitor	-1
this great pack'n'play . it easy set-up take any place . bassinet great - very sturdy larger than one i . colors bright music piece keeps our baby attention . my only problem piece top . whenever i try use it , arms bow it doesn't look very sturdy . i also trouble using this piece mat ground . it just doesn't seem very sturdy i tried everything . other than , i am glad i bought this !	-1
our daughter turning 2 years old this week i felt it time finally write review this amazing product . very beginning , she incredibly alert interested baby . she born c-section 38 weeks eyes hands wide open . once they finished cleaning her up , my husband i thrilled just cuddle her talk her while she looked us both wide eyes made little coo coo sounds . right away she great nursing very good latch . she rarely ever cried , when she , it quiet little " lay lay lay " sound , not wild waa-waa . throughout infancy she always capable adapting every situation quickly without emotional outburst . where it would seem other children would over-stimulated environment , she would thrive seem want more stimulation ! only three months age , people thought she older because her alertness interest people animals . she hit every developmental milestone months early , especially language ( sign speech ) , music appreciation , colors/shape/letter/number recognition . her pediatrician happily surprised her suggested i should five more just like her ! when we bought babyplus , we thought , " if it helps only 10% well testimonials say it , it worth it " . we're certain it contributed positively helping develop this little miracle ours . we're now expecting child #2 ( 25 weeks ) although not using baby plus could interesting experiment ( same gene pool , same parenting , etc . ) , we're too interested possibilities how much it may contribute our next child us withhold it .	1
i bought this swing because our first baby colic reflux i heard someone else say side-to-side swinging action really calmed their babies colic . i thought this baby might too so we bought this swing . no colic this time , but she already loves watch birds butterflies turn around top . she follows them around her eyes . very stimulating young ones	1

i love bather . i hated old plastic ones , this my daughter more comfortable doesn't cry when i give her bath . i wish i it my first child	1
this monitor pretty good . it pick up my little one little noises so i get her before she awakens . it clicking sound it if reception less then 4 bars ( which it less then 4 bars most time my house long ) . i high praise fisher price exchange service . i bought monitor before my little one born so therefor didn't use it until after 30 day return allowance amazon up . then after 6 hours use monitor stopped working . i able send it fisher-price they exchanged it less then ten days ! ( no questions asked	-1
this nursing bra extremely comfortable , once you get it . it difficult get over chest back . you practically need 5 hands because it tends roll under you're pulling it down your back . i've wearing it during my pregnancy , i can't imagine how much more difficult it may put when my breasts grown after delivery . i give it 4 stars though it comfort . once it you hardly know you're wearing bra , snaps easy undo resnap one hand . because they plastic snaps though , i'm wondering how long they last 7-8 feedings day . i write more this once baby arrives ( 5 more weeks ! )	-1
this most wonderful handy kit i ever . everything it perfectly made iteams inside case , it just wonderful !!!!	1
we registered this product since it includes so many items necessary baby . upon receiving it shower gift , i knew this going great . i love convenient pouch all tools accessories come . it small enough carry around diaper bag . this must every new parent	1
i purchased this carrier when my son just week old used it nearly one year . it clearance babies us only fifteen dollars . it well worth price . only problem i ever encountered it back support minimal . i frequent back problems it not take much aggravate it . weight my son get little daunting six month mark . my brother would also use carrier he claims support fine him . i would say if you back problems think hard this purchase , if you don't go ahead . i personally would still make this purchase . plus not look silly those women carrying around their child sling . people never gave me those looks this !	-1
i like this organizer , since stroller i doesn't any holders itself ( " pusher " ) . there nice zippered area keys go into stay secure one drink holder . i don't any problem this organizer all but i put it 4 stars because i would like say majority time i'm out using stroller , i'm adult who could also use drink holder . we're used graco-designed strollers come 2 drink holders . it not end world someone holds their drink ... but it would nice if they could include pocket drink . : -	-1
i liked this positioner because it came adjustable head piece . my baby kept wiggling up top headboard this piece kept him doing so . i also liked fact my baby grew wider i could adjust wedges . one more thing this comes mat . this saved me changing sheet because he puked up so much . i bought two would flipp flopp them when he would get sick	1
i used one these 24 inch extensions cover 90 inch space . kidco configure gate contains three 24 inch pieces ( i.e. 72 inches total ) , so if you need extra length , you purchase 8 or 24 inch extensions customize your gate any length . extension easy use very sturdy . gate looks uniformed you cannot tell it several separate pieces . only ' issue ' you connect extensions either section w/the door ( i.e. 24 inch section open/close swing door ) or use it end piece . i not able continously connect extensions one ( not sure if i this incorrectly or not . ) but nonetheless , extension worked fine i love my new gate	1
my 14-month old daughter loves these snack cups . she monitor her snack time , eating much or little she needs . she loves carrying around snack cup one hand sippy cup other . only reason i give it 4 stars , because she tendency keeping her hand flaps while walking around . this makes single cheerios fall out here there . but , nothing compared giving her snacks open bowl . i've only used them cheerios so i can't comment other snacks ( she tends choke goldfish so she only gets those while sitting high chair ) . she hasn't tried taking off lid like other reviewers , so that not problem us ( least not yet ) . we use them all time i definitely recommend them	-1
these slings essential part parents . both my husband i use new native slings daily basis . we've ' wearing ' our daughter since day one continue now she three months . this helped me tremendously getting ' know ' my baby . it allows me responsive immediately her needs because i read her cues before she gets full blown cry . it helps me accomplish tasks around house makes shopping/running errands easy . we not even own detachable infant carseats . i cannot imagine lug one those things around ! i feel like this helped her transition her womb environment outside world . it gives her sense security even new situations . unlike front facing carriers , she turn her head into our chests if she feels insecure or overstimulated . there endless benefits ' wearing ' your baby i feel like this sling made it incredibly easy me my husband so . there no buckles or rings or fasteners , just slide it . if first you don't succeed , try again later . it may more comfortable you baby different stage . tip , get moving ! motion what soothes babies brings them comfort . again , baby wearing such wonderful thing . i suggest you read up benefits find sling/carrier works well you . we recommend this one all new parents never anyone complain	1
my baby loves it . way it bigger than it looks picture . i afraid it would too small my 12lb baby but it fits her perfect .	1
what lifesaver this pillow my 2 month old daughter . when my son wants me play game , puzzle or play floor . i just lay her pillow so she watch us feel apart our play time . i also found it helpful when i fold laundry . i lay her down right beside me she watch what i am doing . it props baby head up just enough -- better than just laying flat floor . lounger also cradles baby . i wish i found this when my son baby . i recomend this lounger every new mommy .	1
i got this tray my son daily rides car , it terrific ! he eat it , put his sippy cup into cup holder , totally independent . he also play it - cars , crayons , etc ., it holds his books too . after approximately 9 months constant use , it cracked . ( it very stiff , course , but i don't recall anything significant happening it when it cracked ) . worth money far i am concerned .	-1
this awfully cute bedding set i'm very pleased it . it arrived quickly , good quality , though fitted sheet little thin , it still good backup .	-1
i bought this upon recommendation my lactation consultant , so far i've very pleased . i wanted few bottles breastmilk available so my husband could feed our baby when i'm out running errands . there just few parts , so assembly , disassembly cleaning very easy . but best part pump , you buy different-sized breastshields use it . i needed larger one than what came standard it . it makes pumping more comfortable . first few times i used it , i considered switching electric pump because i wasn't pumping much milk . but more i pumped , more milk i produced . this breastpump worth every penny . i recommend it anyone who primarly breastfeeds , but wants option able someone else occasionally feed baby .	1
i bought this swing our first child specially because it many features ..... overall i am happy it our son seems enjoy it .... but few things i wish it .... one seat could reclined two toys made some kind noise get attention . overall price it good	-1
my daughter most happy when she her halo . i love these sleep blankets , cotton ones use florida weather just perfect then colder months toasty warm fleece . i wish they would come longer size since she outgrew them height well before weight limits . i recommend them anyone who wants good night sleep , your baby always just warm enough not warm these fantastic sleepers	1
this great organizer . i read other reviews bit skeptical until i received this one . it great ! we use avent bottles they , all their parts , fit very well . there even hooks bottom so hang items such pacifiers . it take little while figure out how make it not leak water counter , but once we mastered , all well	-1
my first son race car bed which wasn't made very well . we moved him big bed when our second child ready toddler bed . well , we decided get rid old car bed get him his own thomas bed his 2nd birthday since he obsessed thomas . best decision ever ! it so much better made other plastic beds ! i'm so glad i read reviews ... springs crib fits perfectly thomas bed ( it pretty strong because i lay bed him night if i ) . it really worth money . if you looking into cute toddler bed boy , i'd skip other cute beds go straight this one ! we all love it	1
i bought this seat because we small eating area our kitchen , too small full-size high chair . seat worked wonderfully age 5 months now age 21 months . i find seat hard recline or sit up but i only handful times once you find right setting your child it stays there until he/she ready next setting . cloth lining very easy remove , wash , put back plastic under seat cover easy wipe clean . tray easy put , remove again wipe clean or wash off sink . i also found seat easy take off dining chair when i need chair entertaining others . my daughter never complained sitting seat , now we no longer using tray but still using seat booster , enjoys her own place table . i highly recommend this seat parents looking conserve space their dining areas but not sacrifice convenience or comfort .	-1
i ordered this shade hoping it would cover all my baby when we're out strolling sun . it pretty good job ; only my son feet ankles exposed when he reclined ( my only beef product ) , but i cover his little piggies ankles sunscreen or shoes no problem . i like fact shade protects uv rays easily adjustable . i leave it my stroller all time still fold up stroller it attached . i think side pouches excellent plus . i am very pleased this product recommend it my friends family	-1

diaper genie stage 2 refills helped us eliminate odors our twins room . easy install discard . our one year old twins use lot diapers they eating solid foods 6 months . but you install them tightly diaper genie . if refill wabbles its place , then you need see what wrong before starting using it . otherwise odors come out . real fact it works !!. you know , its great home my twins their room everything tidy . we used throw diapers bathroom garbage , but after few hours we couldn't stand going there . note : i am father , just spend couple hours day them ... my wife could tell you more how she loves this diaper genie	1
we received original co-sleeper gift . we also considered getting mini co-sleeper pack'n'play or similar playard . main advantage co-sleeper you attach it your bed so you reach your baby without getting up . original co-sleeper also used playard . playard capacity up 50 pounds , most brands only rated 30 lb . similarly bassinet level rating 30 lb . most brands go 15 . co-sleeper itself 2 or 3 pounds heavier than typical playard . width 28 " so co-sleeper go through our 29 " doorways without collapsing , unlike several playards around 31 " . there trick collapsing top bars - you pull bar upwards when you press buttons , then it easy . ( otherwise you push until your thumbs purple nothing happens ) this explained their website should included manual . i lot reservations after reading other reviews here but am glad i chose keep co-sleeper expect it use it constantly . also , arm reach canopy really strong beautiful i'm confident it'll keep cats out	1
i think this great quality product , i love idea it . however , i find my son whose 7 weeks old just not comfortable it . it not very soft it just so big him right now . i get him sleep it only if he completely zonked out beforehand . i think mini co-sleeper might worked better us beginning . original might better he gets older use play pen part it . i add directions somewhat difficult understand without going over them many , many times	-1
i replaced our old ocean wonders aquarium soother this rainforest waterfall version month half ago . aquarium still working our baby liked lights music , but i looking something would play longer period time . aquarium , i go her room press button couple times before she would fall back asleep . not fun 3 or 4 morning when all i want fall back asleep . i read waterfall soother plays up 18 minutes , so i thought i'd check it ou t.t he soother 3 different length settings : lights , music/sounds , movement 6 minutes ; lights music/sounds 12 minutes ; music/sounds only 18 minutes . there 3 settings sounds : rainforest sounds without music ; rainforest sounds lullabies ; rainforest sounds classical music . there 3 volume settings well . i ours set 12 minutes sounds lullabies i rarely go back her room press button second time . she almost instantly settles down once music starts . if i happen put her down nap or bed while she still awake , she'll quietly watch lights fall asleep her own . i'll admit hearing songs rainforest noises over baby monitor soothing relaxing i try fall back asleep . my only complaint lights seem really bright something supposed lull baby sleep . i ended up covering ours light flannel blanket dull light bit . baby can't see critters , but since i don't them set move , it not really big deal . despite bright lights , we're happy this soother	1
my son tiny- born 5lbs 6oz very much preemie . i simply cannot imagine putting him infant seat without this . it keeps his entire body place- not just his head . it provides great support soft white fuzzy side very warm ( we havnt used other side yet . ) my only complaint its bit akward get shoulder straps correct place around baby- but thats mostly because our baby still very tiny . once he ;s bigger we move headpiece up it shouldnt problem	-1
this carseat good value . pad bottom seat secures my 4 month old quite well removable well head pillow . i add infant head support her neck but that expected 4 month old . it reclines far enough her head doesn't fall forward it so simple adjust straps . overall very nice carseat money i spent .	-1
we purchased fisher-price open top take-along swing few months ago our daughter , very pleased its quality performance . we haven't any problems operation swing , even our little one grown her present weight 18+ lbs . it runs batteries , which us seem last almost month moderate use . this swing several great features . it folds up very easily really portable claimed . it pops right trunk trips grandma house , i've also used it quite bit backyard when i want yard work . 5 year-old house , i also appreciate able quickly carry it room room . only flat 5 foot tall short ( admittedly weak ) arms , i lot difficulty carrying swing baby it , but swing lightweight enough carry one-handed while baby other arm . though i'm pleased this swing , i'd really recommend it * addition * traditional baby swing rather than instead one . compact nature this swing means rocking motion very fast-moving , unlike slow , soothing motion taller swings . my daughter seems like take-along swing just fine when she alert , awake mood . when she tired , however , it just goes too quickly , even lowest setting , seems overstimulate her rather than calm her down . i'd originally purchased this idea replacing our full-sized graco swing , but we've ended up keeping both around they seem fill different needs . overall , i'd certainly recommend this swing - but if you're only going one swing your house , you might consider whether you'd more grateful big swing rocks your baby sleep , or this little one entertains during those fussy , bouncy times	-1
love these . i use them everywhere . i really can't imagine not them , since my son throws down all plates napkins still .	1
we really enjoy this travel system . car seat fits into both base stroller allowed us leave our sleeping daughter undisturbed when moving her in/out car . off work 3 months , i didn't feel cooped home when i could easily take my daughter store or park . big stroller compared umbrella strollers , we still prefer take it , because diaper bag other items fit easily underneath , seat-back folds down ( allowing sleep or diaper changes ) , it three cupholders , 2 side pockets hold other items ( burp cloth , bottled water , toys ) , little compartment sunglasses or cell phone . basket underneath accessible hands-free pressing up or down basket your foot . stroller fits trunk our compact saturn 4-door , or if necessary , front passenger seat ( upside-down fit wide wheels , which anyway relatively easy remove ) . loaded stroller easy guide one hand , so i push it if i happen carrying my daughter . stroller sturdy smooth enough take down street , paved park paths , we always use it packed sand beach ( it even works over brief path over unpacked sand , if you go backwards ) . her car seat stroller , she could get complete protection sun light rain two canopies , although i found draped blanket allowed more air flow . we took whole system 10-day trip , which included flight out town , i felt like our load lighter than those we took before our daughter born . 6 months , she just outgrown car seat ( but she basically off-the-charts her height/weight ) , but we still use stroller now she sit up . drawbacks , all fairly minor : not easy close stroller one-handed . wheels wider than carriage appears top , so i'm always banging wheels something . it takes few minutes remove/replace washable carseat cover , but this probably necessary due straps . any carseat , we would suggest getting help certified people proper installation carseeat your car ; we many questions installation , particularly since our car lacked latch system . we purchased second base so we didn't remove one our car our trip or our babysitter car	1
i think this great stroller traveling . i 4 year old she loved riding it . we used it our vacation disney world it wonderful all walking we . it fit tight spaces very easy manuever . it light weight easy use . overall i am glad i this great strolle	1

i used this system 9 weeks now . bottle leak if you not tighten ring enough or correctly - i test shake before i feed if its wrong i unscrew reseat nipple . my daughter less gas these bottles than playtex bottles i tried . if your child gags one reviewer commented you need slower nipple . i use standard nipples not adjustable flow nipples . i adapter system allows me pump into bottle i like convenience able cap bottle when refrigerator it until feeding time . these bottles well dishwasher clean up easily	1
i am pretty picky shopper , but i fallen love this product . my now 6 1/2 month old daughter terrible reflux this only place i could ever get her sleep comfortably . she still sleeps it ( 18 pounds , it still safe up 25 or when they crawl out ) . there cushion newborns it removable use older babies . save money you'd spend co-sleeper , swing or bassinet try this instead . i buy it every baby shower i attend .	1
this product helps my colicky baby sleep through night , especially since she can't kick off blankets . i highly recommend it . sizing different than baby us . i'm probably going some exchanges so thought i'd provide info . x-small ( newborn ) 5 10 lbssmall ( up 6 months ) 10 18 lbsmedium ( 6-12 months ) 16 24 lbslarge ( 12-18 months ) 22 28 lbsx-large ( 18-24 months ) 26 36 lb	1

i would like ditto ( thank ! ) reviewer who suggested cvs brand covers . after reading her review , i purchased covers cvs.com . then i thought checking walgreen , sure enough , they carry them ( same price cvs , 40 $5.99 ) . i just picked up box today . so i soon bunch covers , but i don't care . i just love this thermometer . i actually one light it . outstanding product	1
i love plug-in feature , there many times i've left swing ( rush change diaper left it ) . true , it stop if lightly touched or blanket falls . swing isn't incredibly fast , but my 2 month old , it worked well . there two volume levels music , but i've only used lowest setting .	-1

this one best market . looks good holds tons toys 2 drawers bottom really nice holding books . " must buy "	1
this toy favorite my 10 month old . he likes crinckle fin mirror . he also loves music , which calms him down when he crying . music soothing doesn't grate our nerves even though we've heard it many times . my only complaints there just two short tunes play alternatively you press his belly fairly hard each time you want one play . it would nice if there setting them play few or more times . there pictures words one fin useless there fit einstein theme . all all , good product i would buy again . way , thing he wearing his head diving mask snorkle	-1

i replaced my baby old bumper this one when she became mobile . it works fairly well keeping her getting her arms or legs caught crib slats . only complaint i " short " section bumper pushed down quite easily baby , thus defeating purpose keeping arms/legs inside crib	-1
this seatsaver one few wide enough tall enough suvs . contrast one other reviews ( i am not affiliated seat manufacturer ) , this seat job adequately , one should not post poor rating without researching specs , measurements , fit , etc ., imho . there no quot ; universalquot ; seat saver or , matter , car seat , fit every car . this one manages catch most itty-bitty things kids manage somehow accumulate sturdy enough car seat not make indentations actual seat , hence , serves its purpose well	-1

i bought this backpack after reading several other reviews i am glad i ! i some shopping around local stores all other backpacks i found either much more expensive or same price but fewer features . my 7 month old daughter loves this backpack . addition , we don't need diaper bag because it so many pockets . i not any trouble putting sun visor backpack very easy store use . i originally bought this backpack take abroad place stroller but i see it going handy places like zoo grocery shopping well . i don't know how it would serious campers , but every day use it great .	1
these wonderful ! my baby getting uncomfortable swaddled three months , so we decided make switch sleep sacks . we worried her arms free she might hard time falling and/or staying asleep . this true first so we started only putting her these during daytime - light cotton one . after week she not waking early her naps anymore after two weeks we tried her it night - she slept straight through night ( she when she swaddled ) . so transition painless she seemed much happier baby able reach her hands move her arms . while i didn't notice shrinkage i notice zipper bunch up bit , but this hasn't problem . sometimes my daughter sucks it if it gets close her mouth , but she reach it - it doesn't cover her face all or trap air she could rebreathe . i didn't like these don't sleeves so i tried carter sleep sacks found sleeves too short hard get my daughter . those sacks only come one size which my daughter already outgrown four months ( 14 lbs , 24 inches ) . she also outgrown small size sleep sack , but medium size fits her perfectly some room grow . i didn't want use fleece first since it polyester . i wanted use cotton . but we've found she sleeps longer seems prefer he heavier fabric fleece one . also , we only bought these blue even though we girl because color calming our easily overstimulated baby . we've washed these many times they look just good hold together just well they originally . we've also found you put your baby into next larger size without it so big they get their arms out or it bunches up around their face . so after everything we've tried we've loved these sleep sacks day one	1
my daughter recently her second child , spends alot time breastfeeding . this product allows her pump her convenience . she others hold feed baby while she spends some time her other child . product works very well . she said it takes little bit experimenting adjusting get it set work best her , but it excellent product . she previously less expensive product manufacturer , heard how good medela brand friend . this brand pleasure work after using less productive , noisier pump she before . we would highly recommend this product , product well worth price paid	-1
i got this pump hand-me-down my friend . it worked great even after many years ... i eventually purchased pump style advanced limited edition where pump separated bag . it takes up less desk space ( no extra space required bag ) . also , it more portable if all you need pump . i pump all over house ( study , bedroom , living room while watching tv my husband ) . just note some people problems getting milk out medelas ... it may not pump itself but size flanges . every woman breast nipples different sizes . initially , i using standard 24mm flanges ( suction cup things go over your breasts ) . it painful pump my milk would not come out even though i engorged plenty milk . it would take me 2 hours just get 2 oz milk ! i went see lactation consultant who suggested i try next size up flanges ( 27mm ) . she got me one try it made world difference . i could immediately pump 2oz under 5 mins . now , i pump daily stock up get 4 oz both breasts under 10 mins ( estimate since i don't really time it cause it so fast ) . i am now planning pump donate my milk milk bank . this pump made world difference . i think medela makes flanges 3 different sizes . standard 24mm comes all their pumps , 27mm 30mm .	1
this sleepsack keeps our little bundle warm toasty those cold san francisco nights . it really easy use move carset stroller . i wish it zipped up just little higher sides , but it best thing around we've seen .	1
i love how wide they . this makes them much easier clean handle . since they shorter i fit them short shelves my fridge when i use stopper caps them . i also fit them my milk cooler my breast pump because they short . my baby able hold them ease since they wider than other bottles . her arms don't stretch far . i haven't any real problems these bottles . i weary use them after friend complained leaking problem . i went ahead them because my sisters said they didn't any problems them . they leaked twice but only because i didn't screw lid all way because my hands wet . any bottle leak if you don't screw lid sufficiently . i used plenty other brands worse leaking issues when i watched my twin cousins . we tried three different brands weren't ever really happy any them	1
i two kids use my evenflo carseat . i hated it . it like they never even tried it out see how well its features worked . i finally got so sick it when my 2nd child 4 months old i ordered babytrend flexloc . first i seduced high safety ratings , but even after consumer reports article rescinded , i still liked lot features . pros : -very comfy seat , good padding -the canopy twice long my evenflo so it cover baby almost completely- canopy stays place ; it doesn't fall forward or backward behind seat- tightening mechanism under baby feet easy reach very easy adjust make straps tighter or looser depending what baby wearing- harness mechanism very easy adjust ( shoulder strap height ) . my evenflo rethreaded every few months even my mechanically inclined husband said it horrible . flexloc just dial back you turn--it breeze . - seat transfered cars without base . it strapped directly car using seat belt car seat or using latch system if your car it . - triangular handle nice grip easy hold any position- this carseat lighter than my evenflo- cloth very wipeable , not absorbant spills stains my evenflocons : i found few minor cons definitely would not deter me buying this carseat , one might ( depending how i resolve it once i contact babytrend ) . - release button take seat off its base toes under seat . it little harder reach than ones behind head if carseat backward facing . - others said , buttons move handle bit stiff , but not horribly so . i prepared them way worse . - handle thinner doesn't feel sturdy my evenflo when carrying baby around , but it hasn't any problems-this one big one i check babytrend : twice when i turned corner sharply , carseat tipped 45 degree angle ! i tightened down seatbelt much i could , putting my full weight it using seatbelt retracting mechanism . but maybe i'm still not doing it right . base narrower than my evenflo , so maybe that why ? so i need contact babytrend see if they any suggestions . until then , i guess i'll take corners slower ! overall , i felt like this seat major improvement over my evenflo even over graco snugrides i checked out store . it intelligently designed easy use adjust baby grows . i would recommend it sure . just make sure you strap it tightly or use latch system if you it	-1
i read some other reviews poor , but i disagree . my son loves this toy . he smiles when he sees turtle across his room . it plays music continually 12 minutes . so , middle night when he wakes up , i turn it he asleep time it runs out . we moved it twice straps seemed sturdy . however , it recommended this toy removed when child 5 months old or able get hands knees . this completely contradicts interactive play mode , since baby needs both physically mentally developed stage beyond 5 months reach all buttons .	-1
this thin sheet but it fits my full-size pack play bassinet perfectly . i would recommend getting 2 them because my son wets through it often	-1
i never seen any inflatable tubs quite like this we so pleased ! our 8 month old daughter loves independence she her own tub we feel she much safer than big tub this age . we love how you hang it up shower wall dry . just make sure suction cup wet it won't fall off wall . sizewize , it basically perfect fit our tub , which slightly tapered head toe , but i could see how it would snug if you small rectangular tub .	1
love it ! fits pad beautifully seems get softer everytime you wash it	1
i bought this beacause i needed my gate just little bit wider . it attached very easily easy install . also , it very hard find stores	1
i thought fold-up tub great idea , but we've used this only maybe 10 times before my daughter turned 6 months , maximum age use . i paid only $10 , so not much loss . she objected first time we tried it , 2 weeks , so we went back sponge baths while . i would suggest gradually introducing your baby tub . toys helped distract her when she little older . my daughter seemed too big it even 3 months , though she always 97%+ height weight . wash her backside , you course take her out tub . i usually forgot plug it before filling it , so usually water all over floor . instructions say tub supposed supported sink ; it certainly doesn't fit our oval bath sink . maybe it would fit 2-part kitchen sink . folding feature make it easy store our closet shelf . little tub bath , i liked it . it good quick bath or really soak her , but end i prefered unhurried sponge bath waterproof pad bed , which i think got my daughter cleaner	-1
well , i felt little silly paying $20 ( shipping ) 2 pieces plastic , 2 bra hooks , some rubber bands . however , kit work , allow you pump hands free . one word caution - if you use medela quick clean steam bags clean your pump parts , take hands free plastic sleeves off before throwing bag microwave ! otherwise , they warp don't fit right	-1
i bought same brand , but maybe newer/older version this ? it didn't book or decogestant only older children others mentioned . however , it infant tylenol equivelent , which we lucky enough not try ye t.t he gas drops fantastic - thank goodness we these , especially when we change his formula !! anytime our son " fussy no reason " we tried these drops first it stopped fussiness almost every time . saline drops great nose drops really helped during his colds . aspirator works fine , i've never tried different one , so can't compare . he didn't care teething toy , doesn't care taste teething gel , but it seems work . it also two cooling wipes which we haven't use ( no fevers yet ! ) . overall i really glad this , all these things together nice case i slid right under his changing table - no need hunt things middle night . i'd recommend this all new moms	-1
i wish it would zip up all way ... top coming down all time i adjusted . maybe it better two up age child .	-1
my wife i ( yep guy reviewing kids toy ! ) bought this present our 7 month old niece . she absolutely hooked it . relatively short attention span most toys , it rewarding see how much she likes it how long it entertains her . just squeezing musical tentacles her keeps her happy ! big doe eyes her mesmerized well . when she gets bored , learning play tunes keeps adults happy !! playing easy , you get two color coded tunes label help musical friend we know lot more now . my wife 4 months pregnant , we ordered already . only reason 4 stars one we bought trouble playing lowest note ( red tentacle ! )	1
i told get diaper genie many people but liked looks reviews diaper dekor so decided put it my registry . i am so glad i . i only empty it every 6-7days it simple odor free . even when full there no odor ! i didnt need put refill 3months . refills look pricey till you realize how long each one lasts . comparison , its cheaper ! i would recommend this anyone	1
i got this toy when my baby 7 months old , he now 8 1/2 months old . we've used it lots local driving roundtrip los angeles phoenix ( 7+ hours each way ) . it doesn't work miracles , but it definitely help calm distract my baby when he starts fuss , 70%-80% time . i think it more effective now than it when we first got it , maybe because baby started look forward it . it might help i * only * use it when he starts fuss . i haven't any problems toy working , volume dial nice feature . it its shortcomings , though , like some other reviewers pointed out : it only stays 15 minutes ( presumably save batteries ) so pretty much every time i put baby his carseat , i push button turn it , just case we need it during drive . it sometimes moves out place which affect able see baby mirror , but it still works distract him . it plays 5 or 6 songs random order , but they all extremely short , so it ends up very repetitive . overall , i think it useful tool calming baby during car trips , when it doesn't work it generally because my baby so tired or hungry i don't think anything would really help except getting him out car . even though repetitive songs get annoying , it far better than hearing baby screaming while everyone trapped car together	-1
i just bought these my daughter looks adorable . first time i put them she got little fussy until she realized she could see through them . shades come two straps , one small one large . my daughter four months old smaller strap barely fits but larger one still little big . velcro either side smaller strap just barely attached fits comfortably only if around bottom her head . this position , her ears little pushed down but strap soft it not big deal . if straight around her head , shades too tight squish area around her eyes . even if adjusted small possible , large strap still little too big . it should fit month i think .	-1
this our third baby monitor . first two static if you would plug anything into same outlet or get them near other electronic devices . this one worked flawlessly our home w/ zero static . talkback feature also wonderful three year old ( " go back sleep , " " i'll get you juice morning , " etc . ) not get up go child room real feature . only reason i gave it four stars because it only two channels because signals aren't encrypted . anyone else fm receiver pick up your conversations , but most monitors this way . we took monitor friend house it picked up lot static/interference something house ( video monitor , tv , i don't know . ) since it only two channels , we not able find clear channel . overall thoughts : best monitor i've ( stay away fisherprice models ) . i would buy again unless i apartment complex ( i wouldn't want other people listening ) , i would prepared take it back if i needed more channels	-1
my baby i just love it !!!! it so easy bath her now so much fun ! i started bathing her everyday this bathtub it just awesome . she plays her toys tons fun . side where her head rests lifted so she safely lay down relax . after her bath , i just empty tub hang it knob our bathroom until next day . i really recommend it , it super practical .

i this my daughter when she fit into baby carrier car seat . it awesome . i never worry blankets falling off or if she warm enough . they tell me hospital , however , if you put anything your baby car seat it voids warranty car seat . this goes underneath them so it probably , but i figured it probably safer than putting blanket over her anyway	1
i am mom three kids this far best pack-n-play market . when #3 came we needed purchase new pack-n-play . graco pack play bug toys absolutely best we've ever owned . bright colors cute toys make it fun environment our 8 month old . she loved bright play mat since 6 months , but now she sitting up she enjoys looking mirror pulling rattle butterfly wings . she actually gets excited playing her pack play ... mom get dinner cooked without interruption ! , best all , it so much bigger than other pack plays . there plenty room her play without rolling over top her toys . set up take down super easy ... all four sides break-down very easily it folds nicely without any hassle . i am also fan much thicker play mat fits into floor pack play . i never worried her hurting herself if she plopped over when first learning sit up . overall , i can't say enough wonderful things this product ! i'd put it new parent " must " list sure	1

this third potty i've purchased my son . first one made parents , it tipped over first time my son sat it . second first years elmo 3-in-1 , cup pinched his behind 3 places leaving cuts . this one great . although my son hesitant go it first ( which i attribute his experience elmo potty ) , he fits nicely it . other potties too narrow front back , i adjust him several times get him situtated so he could use front guard . seat lifts out cup which lends itself not pinching his bottom ; easy clean up . it low enough ground his legs fit too . back arm supports fit well also . it solid construction good buy .	1

i admit i absolutely no desire sterilize bottles old fashioned way ( boiling water pot stove ) so when i saw this product over seven years ago i bought one immediately . i loved it so effortless ! pay attention instructions tell you how much water use based your microwaves wattage . no one wants wonder if bottles sterilized or so-so when it comes their child , so read instructions . i also purchased when my second daughter born because i gave my sister first one . my only issue because its small size ( it fit microwave after all !!!! ) , you really stack bottles , nipples , etc . way utilizes all available space . once again , instructions clearly tell you best way stack . so , if your sleep deprived , hormonal state you actually manage read stupid small instruction booklet you save yourself lot heartache	-1
i used this my third child . i washed it over over , always , stains came right out . it so soft !!!! definitely good buy	1
we got this before our little one born . she born little premature only 4 lbs . we used it her bedside bassinet , later her crib . although we few false alarms once she started moving around crib , they worth it peace mind all other hours . baby girl now two we continue use it . she toddler bed now , we tell if she gets out bed when she not supposed ! this great device everyone should one . comparible price other nursery monitors , you get so much more . it also clear sound little interference our house	1

we love diaper dekor referred it many our friends family ! it super simple use refills which seem expensive first actually cheaper than other brands because they last 2-3 months vs . week ( i.e. diaper genie) ! reading other reviews , i think i clear few things up - it seems these people misled hence their problems this product . first , there 2 versions this pail - larger called diaper dekor plus regular size called simply diaper dekor . thus , there 2 different sizes refills , plus regular . you find out which model you simply opening door pail - there sticker model there - if you not see plus anywhere , you need buy regular refills - plus not fit , vice versa . secondly , refills very easy insert , you simply follow directions which come unit . basically , you remove plastic insert , wrap opened refills inside insert around top - excess refill wraps around outside plastic then you sit it pail - knot tied bottom new refill . if you unit , this make sense - if you haven't bought one yet , i probably just confused you - but you see once you get it it very easy ! last but not least , refills market past year absolutely no scent all - i personally would not mind baby powder scent but these no scent . it not like i sniffing inside pail or anything , so it doesn't matter - afterall , once refill pail , no scent come out - not even dirty diapers ! unfortunately , it seems these few reviewers who gave this product poor rating misinformed store workers their poor review actually nothing product but rather frustration stemming unknowledgable employees baby stores . i hope this helped ! we've this unit nearly year absolutely swear it ! it godsend ! no smells how much easier you get than just dropping diaper into pail not thing ! not many other units allow you store up 3 weeks diapers without single scent	1
i bought smaller version quot ;d iaper decorquot ; ( opposed larger quot ;d iaper decor plusquot ;) 18 months ago . although i believe smaller version discontinued year ago , i not yet problem finding refill liners my local babies us or on-line here amazon . i highly recommend diaper decor . i not any experience diaper genie , so i cannot compare . i not any odor problems diaper decor . it very easy change liners there no mess . my foot-operated lid opener also broke like some other reviewers , but this not problem me . i just open lid manually leave it open while i am changing diaper . i would recommend diaper decor plus size	-1
this best potty seat you buy . it one piece so it easy clean if you boy it great splashguard . also , i love handle so you hang it wall	1

i parent who said " i'll never spoil my child wipe warmer -- it only encourage her wear diapers longer . " then i woke up realized warm wipes night mean baby who doesn't cry during changings goes back bed more easily -- this could mean extra half hour sleep me . i am now big fan warmer . it works very quickly doesn't dry them out , light just bright enough change baby night without waking her up . definately nice product .	1

i fabric seat saver my leather seats before . needless say fabric doesn't protect leather very well . i ended up deep depressions leather . hopefully leather go back ( fingers crossed ) . firm bottom piece seems work well prevent any more indentations showing up . both carseats secure ever . i rear forward facing models .	1

i love this sling ! but i'd like stress other people you practice it find what works you . it may too big your newborn . i started using it when my son 4 weeks , but he large baby . i've found key wear it high ! instructions say you your baby more comfortable baby chest height . it true ! if you try wear it baby hanging little lower near your stomach it going hurt your back shoulder wear you out he/she going squirm uncomfortable . i used it every day my sons 3rd month when we hotels moving . now i used it every time i grocery shop because soon he it he falls asleep , no matter time day . if i try push him through whole store sitting cart his carseat he'll start screaming but if i put him my sling i won't hear peep out him whole trip . you admit it so cute stylish ! several people stopped ask me where i got it i love directing them amazon !	1
we very irregular iron banister different sized spaces bars . this perfect solution because you place tie-down holes wherever you need ties it comes really long , so they fit around large or small bars . we use drill make some holes further edge plastic because hole punch it comes wouldn't reach , but it very easy . i also like this product because it doesn't take away look banister or obscure vision	1

my 1 1/2 year old son really enjoys this toy . he loves putting little men top . he doesn't play toys side , guess thats younger kids , but he enjoy shape sorter drawbridge opening cute holds his attention . i find advantage over classic fisher price he can't easily just rip cover off toss pieces when he gets frustrated . this age , i find alphabet pieces waste wish there more shapes sort . perhaps when he older he'll enjoy letters well , but i doubt he'll still interested . overall , cute toy holds his attention while many not . main drawback there only 4 shapes sort	-1
i my wife very pleased jeep wrangler all-weather umbrella stroller . unlike cheap umbrella stroller we used , this one better construction main folding support tubes . plus , handles longer which means i ( 5'-1 '' guy ) don't walk like neanderthal push my toddler . wheels work pretty well most surfaces even very light snow . brakes durable plastic should last longer than my previous stroller . pouches added plus storing snacks or bus passes . my only disappointment sun screen . it not useful blocking sun my son eyes unless i pull it directly front him . point , he can't see anything . that ok if he falls asleep , but otherwise he ( independent todler ) pull sunscreen off if it blocks his view . added bonus would shoulder strap i could use carry stroller walking more than few feet . while it light compact stroller , it still cumbersome carry if you fold it bus or walk anywhere it . frequently my son wants walk so i take stroller me because i know he'll get tired . so again , shoulder strap would make toting stroller much easier	-1
they're little pricey , but they work great . they easy clean , dry quickly , catch almost all mess my boys make	1
i used this pump my first child 2 years ago . i tried avoid paying $300+ electric pump , this worked great ! i pumped when i returned work , pumped 3 months . i loved not lug around big electric pump work every day . it much easier clean than other manual pumps ( e.g. gerber ) because there few parts remove so your chance losing or breaking parts much lower . pump strong suction , so i've no problem expressing milk ( e.g. up 8 ounces or more each time ) . i just my 2nd child month ago , already i'm able express 5+ ounces milk once . i highly recommend this , especially occasional users , no need spend lots money fancy pumps lots removable , breakable parts . also , i am small chested , so no , you don't well endowed this work	1
i love love loooooove this system ! i pumping exclusively 4 months now only found this month ago . before this , i pumping storing medela bottles , then transferring playtex liners before feeding . then i wash all medela bottles , plus playtex rings , etc . this system , i just pump right into liners . they so easy just grab out fridge go . i warm bottle car warmer using self-contained liners , instead bring medela bottle warm , plus playtex system . overall , this saved me several steps less things wash . dad who said it threw off ounce markers - true . however , liners themselves ounce markings them . just unscrew top ring slightly so liner sinks back down then read ounce marker liner . easy ! i would not buy this system use storing frozen milk ( if you store lot it ) . it would get too expensive my tastes . i two sets perfect refrigerator storage . make sure you get two , because each box only comes one pump adapter . highly recommended one happy mamma	1
i tested this unit maximum sensitivity . first , i bothered constant tick indication baby ok . so i took sensor out see what would happen without baby , ... it stopped ticking . baby not moving , but just it heart and/or lungs working keeps unit ticking . it detects even when you blow sensor . maybe it should not maximum sensitivity , since ceiling fans , etc might activate it , but i truly amazed sensitivity . you turn tick down so it not too bothersome , it like clock ticking , once second when baby ok , if it stops ticking 30 seconds .. noticeable alarm ring .	1
i love this sack . highly recommend it especially if your child likes kick blankets up over their heads . before i purchased this i found her sleeping coveres over her head twice !!!	1
it so difficult carry huge diaper bag while your baby carrier . this product solves problem ! it cute too . i shopping babys ' ' us recently sales girl asked where i got my " super cute " diaper bag/carrier . i told her she insisted her manager store start carrying item ( no word yet whether or not they ) . i recommended this bag all my friends bought two shower gifts . it ultimate convenience fashion	1
this bag great short trip . it enough space few pampers , up 2 bottles ... it depends how well you compact objects into space . im pro . packing things away neatly small space so this bag works good me !	-1
i'm mother 21-month-old . i just got puppy hard time managing stroller leash our walks . this backpack perfect . it fits me well my daughter loves it . she asks stay it when we're ! i worried because she never liked any baby carriers i've tried before when she younger . you toughen up your shoulders ( taking shorter walks first ) before going any long hikes , course . i don't understand chest problem one other reviews , because chest strap adjustable , long , sits just below shoulders , avoiding " busty " area very well . however , it come out box shortest setting , so you loosen it fit your frame . question able " close " frame child it doesn't seem issue mine . stand part folds up easily under child once child your back . you need long enough arms grab it behind you , though . it makes no difference you or child if you leave frame open position during your walk , but if you're tight quarters , you'll want close it . i make mistake trying put aeryn ( my daughter ) feet behind me frame first , which made her knees rest uncomfortably frame . legs supposed go naturally forward toward either side your waist . ( picture box helped me figure out . ) it kids 6 months up 36 months , comes clear rain shield easily zips onto retractable sun shield . rain shield also helpful windy conditions- my daughter thinks it cool leans over fog it her breath . it not easy six-month-old puppy jumping around you , but i've even managed get into straps stand up floor aeryn pack ( i'm reasonably fit , she just under 30 pounds ) . this thing rugged , comfortable , good-looking , " prepared " features like cellphone holder matching fanny pack ( carried frame , if you'd rather )	1
my son very fussy bottle eater . he would never finish his bottle until i switched faster flow nipple . now he finishes his bottle much happier eater . he became frustrated milk wasn't coming out fast enough him faster flow it perfect . he much more content after feeding more relaxed . now we both much happier look forward each feeding	1
i received my original new native sling baby shower gift back 1997 . i wore it nearly every day 15 months then again babies #2 #3 . now we expecting our fourth baby fabric bit faded worn ( we purple one ) , so i thought it time buy second sling . original still good far stitching goes we'll still use it , but i'm bit tired purple color after nine years ! :) pros : this sling smallest far packing it you . it simple double band fabric folded up your bag or purse easily . men don't mind wearing it ( least my husband didn't ) , it comes basic solid colors doesn't scream " baby ! " when you're out . many people couldn't tell i wearing baby when she little . it good place baby nap cover you up bit when you nurse , once you figure out . it more versatile than other types baby carriers you use it newborn toddler ( i've even used it two-year-olds short periods when they tired walking stroller isn't option ) . you carry baby your front or back ( experience , this doable , but mostly older babies ) , your hip ( once your baby sit strongly ) . it also easy throw wash when baby diaper inevitably leaks or spits up all over it . ( no complicated latches , webbing or snaps clean . ) cons : if you get wrong size , baby hang too low your back hurt . my original large size ( based chest measurements manufacturer ) but i'm going order medium this time . my husband still likes large , but he longer torso than i . newborns may need some support new native sling , otherwise you may feel they swimming fabric . i always use tightly rolled-up receiving blanket place it sling first , then lay baby head back top it . this pushes baby up enough toward opening so you don't feel like she lost there . usually i only this first few weeks . after while , your baby big enough peek out her own wave people . trickiest thing new native carrier learning sling baby your back , which enables you things like cooking unloading dryer while your baby sleeps . you put baby your front first then shimmy fabric around baby it . if you master this , sling ideal fussy baby or all-day babywearing . highly recommended ! good value your money .	1
i don't know what one reviewies talking .. if you read manual , you learn you need move " leg " front so seat sits level . keep your childs ' head falling forward . if fails , go burlington coat factory get wedge , prop it up more ..

my daughter got this toy when she 2 months old she still loves it ( 8 months ) . it only toy would keep her entertained car trips first . i took one star off due some minor problems : 1 ) it not machine washable ( unless you don't mind loosing barking sound ) 2 ) battery can't replaced .	-1
we like this car seat price we paid . likes : love easily adjustable belts - we often let straps out lot get her it without her uncomfortable then tighten it appropriately . 5 point harness great . love car seat compatible different strollers . dislikes : it doesn't recline much we'd like head padding superficial . our baby head tends fall forward lot . sun canopy seems like it designed afterthought - it certainly works more than adequately , but doesn't move easily . finally , handle difficult move position position . overall though , price , it good seat .	-1
my daughter received this gift mommy when she 3 1/2 months . first , she petrified objects so close her face , but if you take off ring take it higher , your child really appreciate colors enjoy toy . only complaint i mirror it comes still frightens my child . mirror distorts your child vision , so i took it off purchased some other hanging toys it ! my daughter loves it , she could eating her breakfast , or sitting her swing all she'll stare her playmat ! definite must all parents	1

good things : ( 1 ) no interference . we live residential neighborhood suburbs . ( 2 ) connects no problem two stories down baby 2nd floor monitor basement . i've even used it out yard without any loss connection problems .

i own lot strollers my twin sons (( this one , duoglider , two small single strollers , double umbrella stroller )) i absolutely love this one ! first all , if you want satisfied customer you know what purpose stroller , which jogging , or maneuvering outdoors rough terrain . my husband jogs stroller least once week (( no complaints )) , but i other hand just adore it outdoors . wheels go over almost any surface , including gravel , dirt , grass , concrete , brick , sand , boardwalk anything , i love it . seats both fully recline (( individually )) when they , rear seat mesh so you see your child behind (( although you would most-likely bend down get good look )) . five-point harness jogger must , this model even comes comfortable pads well . basket huge holds everything we need day beach/park/walk around block , which very important me . it also removable , but i don't see why it would advantageous take it off . plenty other storage available behind seats well , handy little pockets pouches store little knick-knacks . considering type stroller it , it folds very easily , i fit it rear my minivan after removing rear front tires (( which equally easy , rear tires come off push button front easy use release mechanism )) . canopy enormous proves great sun protection when needed ! breaks fantastic , stop stroller its tracks which very important if you jogging , need stop quickly , according my husband anyway . included wind/rain shield also very convenient (( left rolled up top canopy , incase there chance rain you don't work 5 minutes attach it get kiddos wet )) , but i wish it also came mesh covers mosquitos other bugs . i dislike fact it extremely difficult turn (( although i kind gotten it down science , you need prepared turn tilt stroller bit , turn very wide not smooth )) . i think it would better if it swivel wheel which option lock place jogging (( swivel wheel would actually extremely dangerous if jogging you could lose control stroller )) , but that just me personally . baskets near impossible access if both seats reclined all way , i wake sleeping babies few occasions (( that why i learned put things such my cell phone wallet canopy pouches , so i don't constantly go into basket )) . canopy quite large , if you not using it its quite pain retract it doesn't go back neatly , if its windy day canopy doesn't always stay up . if you looking good stroller outdoor use , don't mind large size or getting used turning , then i highly recommend tike tech	-1
i ton research convertible infan t-t oddler car seats before my son outgrew his graco snugride 4 months . consumer reports gave this seat highest safety ratings ( this seat highest rating all britax convertible seats ! ) i chose this seat because it eps side-impact protection under carseat cover . it worth extra money because it your child life ! also , it really easy tighten loosen straps , cover really silky comfortable . my son falls asleep within minutes pulling out driveway . my only gripes none existing toddler pillow neck/head supports fit into seat , but may problem manufacturers supports , not britax . also , straps don't soft covers keep them digging into my son neck . i just bought some soft terrycloth ones babies us $4.99 . it works	1

overall , we very happy this product . i like it covers entire side crib doesn't come up only partway like traditional bumper . also , i like breathable netting since baby see out through it since it " gives " bit when baby pushes kicks it . we nonstandard length crib ( babee tenda ) , so we small gaps each end rail , but we read this issue review babee tenda crib owner , so we knew up front we would these gaps . these small gaps not problem us our baby doesn't seem want stick her legs through gaps this location ( i think it difficult since she would lie almost flush headboard or footboard so ) . white satin edge very pleasant look . overall i like this product much more than traditional bumpers i seen .	-1
my baby outgrew regular sized swaddle me 2 months age . i ordered this one when it came mail i couldn't believe how huge it looked ! we didn't actually use it until 2.5 -3 months since it so big . we would fold top down before we swaddled our son this so it wasn't long . 3.5 months , our baby weighs 17 pounds so it hard find something swaddle him , he still needs it . i hope he doesn't outgrow this one near future . i think he'll one those kids who swaddled till he 6 months old this blanket should work	1
bring co-sleeper up height bed , these leg extensions best bet . yes , someone else said , they make it little shaky . so if you not planning attach co-sleeper your bed , you may want leave height alone .

b.o.b. rocks . bob very high quality held up extremely well us after nearly 2 years use . we're little attached bob our house . let me tell you revolution stroller get . we bought it right after our baby born , choked up $40 or so infant seat bar used it our primary stroller ever since . even mall , department stores , etc it great . baby gets smooth ride daddy likes it because it agile almost effortless push . i see hundreds bugaboo strollers around i must admit they nice but b.o.b my choice because price you go more places him . our other seldom used stroller graco something or other i don't even know where it . however i've used it enough compare it bob when collapsing it putting it car . i must say bob easier faster fold o.o ne downside might storage compartment under seat smaller than some those jumbo strollers . however , bob built like tank . we travel bob lot through airports ( yes bob fits through most airport xray while normally collapsed but sometimes i take off back wheels which easy ) we hang stuff off bob handlebars even carry our jumbo car seat top sun shade until we get our car . our family now looking double or tandem stroller . this get interesting because i don't see us doing duallie bob revolution since it no-go mall , target , etc . phil ted e3 buggy double buggy looking tempting but i don't like older child sits tucked behind stroller .. they can't see anything . what i wish b.o.b. corp would come up attachment least same phil ted ..... but tandem stroller revolution would sweet !	1

my months ' experimentation ' few purchases err , this best product its sort out there . it only product i've purchased ( or tried out store ) truly requires only one hand ! my 8 month old my shoulder , i drop this bag into cart seat , i unzip it flip ' diaper pocket ' over back , pull generous , elastic edged cover up over cart handle that just it . additionally , buggy bag among few covers whole cart , ( uniquely ) adds further protection germs 2 separate belts : one go around your child waist , other secure it cart . not forgotten : buggy bag comfortable ( apparently ! ) , simple convenient storage options stores itself w/ ease ! other hand , i tried one imitation popular baby store not only it not open one hand ( necessity baby your hip grocery store parking lot ! ) but i could not get it back into its ' carrying ' shape two hands !! i hid it shelf moved away quickly . eek . product i purchased online came two pieces so many clips belts wrapping it together , i could barely attach it both hands help passersby . while it ' shoulder straps unlike any other , they dont work most carts put advertising placard back cart seat . finally adjusted , product ( " shop'n'dine " ) didnt cover most cart . ( its debut shopping trip ) i threw it back car went home , too tired shop . finally , there lots imitators out there , dont suckered similar names , better price points or preferred fabric choices : buggy bag preserve your sanity , perhaps , your child health .	1

my 5 month old daughter always put her face into bumpers her crib so i stopped putting her crib because i afraid her sufficating without bumbers her hands feet could still get rails crib because she moves aroung so much i afraid her hurting herself . so now i love puttingher crib because bumpers mesh i don't worry . they also real simple put because velcro when you change sheet crib its alot easier get matress back because bumper so flat . great product ! i highly recommend it !!!!	1
armoire very pretty but please show pictures inside furniture pieces because i expecting something else . i still like it very much but i wanted part hang clothes it doesn't one . it very pretty outside it everything i expecting !!! thank you	-1
crib just way it comes best . thicker mattress would bad 2 reasons . firm best avoid suffocation dangers . bumber pads also recommended against * all * modern advice sites classes . sids deaths appear related suffocation , this happens usually when baby mouth nose against padding . firm mattress ( like this very thin one ) much safer . main thing always lay infant it back sleep , not it belly . also , never use bumber padding * any * crib any very young child . finally , there also issue " outgassing " any kind waterproof plastic type matress covers foam filling . what you want , if you can't afford very expensive natural options , * thin * mattress like this one , won't lot material outgas , thus reducing exposure your baby these common somewhat toxic vocs . best buy this few weeks ( or longer ) ahead time , then air out mattress . i'm even putting ours clothes dryer low heat just past switch off point , so drying heats it up little then clicks off heat continues exhausting air past it until end cycle . this my own idea how accelerate outgassing , so our new baby january won't much vocs breath .	1
i bought this pump when i going concert knew i would need pump while i out avoid discomfort leakage . this pump fit my purse easy use . i just slipped out into bathroom pumped . it silent no one even knew	1
product shipped quickly well packaged . each loop or hole edge individual string you tread . would better if strings attached netting . overall , product works very well gave us protection our child we looking . our 22 month old tested it contiually pushing hard running into it there no problems	-1

we bought this crib online couldn't more pleased . shipping great - few minor nicks but nothing overly noticeable . directions aren't bad - but they could lot better/clearer . we also bought matching change table it looks great baby room . net , great value great product !	-1
i received this set baby shower back 2005 . it held up really well . my only advice : retail price $232.00 even amazon price $152 , it still too steep . i never quilt crib because it dangerous so baby - he constantly napping , so i hardly ever " made " bed . next time around , i'm going find pattern i like just buy all decorative things associated it , then buy inexpensive plain bumper sheet . room itself what you everyone else sees . bedding almost impossible see , unless you're hovering over crib . i especially love lamp , switchplate , mobile 5-pc wall hanging this collection . you could buy all accessories truly create safari room less than cost bedding alone .	-1
this great walker . tray plenty activities keep little one busy music steering wheel button lights easily removed make tray even bigger . my grandson just loves walker i too because it gives him freedom move place place safely . amazon sells model #14570 , so don't worry , walker sturdy locking wheels when you prefer him stay stationary . also , plus it converts into walk behind walker which assists child learning walk	1
despite some negative reviews i got this seat because i 8 mth 2.5 yr old my husband deployed so bathtime very challenging . i also textured bathtub bottom so i knew bathring would not work . well this seat fantastic - my baby loves sit it tries grab all bath toys so he chew them . also , whenever i get baby toddler wants jump too which so much easier then conjoling ornery 2 yr old into tub . since using bath seat my infant hasn't scraped his legs it once like some other reviewers mentioned so not sure what . although he tried climb out couple times he usually content sit there . course even this seat you can't let such little ones bathe unsupervised anyways so it fine when he tries get out - i just put him back he happy . even when i don't bath two together i put little one here - just makes it so much easier then trying hold him steady ( he such wiggler - trying crawl/stand immediately)and my hands free scrub him . clean his bottom i just pull him out clean him then stick him back - no problem . clean seat i've followed advice other posts again no problem . i actually came back here buy one my sister but i see it isn't available right now -boo - i'll find it elsewhere . highly recommend	1
there few things i liked my simple round better . such , latch system more difficult decathalon . overall though , very impressive car seat safety system . fabric cover wonderful plush stylish . i always feel safe when my little ones britax . well worth what may seem like exorbitant amount money . you cannot put price safety your child	-1
i love this blanket so much let me count ways ... ( 1 ) certified organic ( so hard find ) , ( 2 ) large enough good , tight swaddle ( good night sleep ) , ( 3 ) darling drawing showing how swaddle baby sewn blanket ( even my husband now swaddle like nurse ) , ( 4 ) soft , soft , softer every wash ! i just love this blanket i feel so good wrapping my little bundle ultimate - i know he loves it too	1
this pump works great occasional use after 5 months , i still not encountered any problems suction some reviewers mentioned . ( instruction book explains how clean motor event suction loss , so hopefully problem avoidable . ) however , beware motor very loud -- i definitely wouldn't recommend taking this one work or anywhere else you would need discreet . ( when i use it , i sit bathroom fan so my family doesn't hear it ! ) i also recommend buying micro-steam bags medela so you just throw parts microwave clean them right away each time you use them	-1
i breast fed my son year 2003 medela pump back then . i trusted medela pick up this one my daughter this year . i pump once day , so they get used , but not abused . model changed some , i think it more powerful this time . thing i don't like , but certainly live , motor not attached breast shield . my chest rather large , so putting bottles unit holding unit my chest one hand not option . i hold each shield upto my chest motor sits my lap . i can't control speed or turn unit on/off because i don't free hand . i leave speed where i need it before take bottle off while it still put it bottle holder while i turn unit off . i still very much like this product it gets job	-1
we bought this stroller take vacation it proved easy check gate airline , lightweight , continues functional , comfortable stroller our son . one feature i expected different how far stroller reclined ... it only slightly reclines so not useful little one who needs lay down further nap while go . i happy amount storage , but times wished storage compartment under seat my bag . all all , we very happy this purchase !	-1
my daughter ( 2 1/2 yrs old ) likes this cot , lot . i bought it her so she could nap it while my m-i-l over watching her since she hard time stairs lifting toddler into high crib . she sleeps it 1 1/2 - 2 hours afternoon , which 1 hour shorter than if she nap her crib inside her ( darkened ) room . it suits this purpose well i intend taking it overnight weekend trips so we don't haul her port-a-crib . only disadvantage she get out it , course , but ... it cot ! she began daycare recently sleeps their cots same amount time , so i figured i'd buy it my m-i-l home . it trick my baby thinks it special . i tell her it only when grandma over ( b/c she wanted start sleeping/napping it all time ) . naturally , i'd prefer she take longer nap , so i told her it special days only , when grandma here . so now she uses it " tuck " her bunny-bear stuffed animal before she goes her room night . i love it , it seems comfortable , very portable handy . i would recommend it . only reason i'm not rating it 5 stars i yet use it weekend trip , but i wanted review it now , case you wondering whether or not get it . i think it very much worth it , but everyone different . it relatively small inexpensive so if your child hates it they may like it their stuffed animal friends . also , it very sturdy supportive opens collapses no trouble all . hope helps	-1
all reviews written this product recalled , incorrect . it original hip hammock all those stores removed shelves . so unless you older model bought before 2/2005 , you should nothing worry . this product great when your baby outgrowns front carriers like baby bjorn . i no problems it it easier than using sling older babies .	-1
i love these cups better yet so my baby ! they easy her hold soft tip makes it easy her drink . she no idea it not bottle . it made transition away bottle so much easier . thank you	1
i got four these sleepsacks , two fleece two cotton . i found fleece sleepsacks get bitty after couple washes , but it didn't effect product . they wonderful . if you buying newborn , get 6-12 month size , since it'll last bit longer . i ended up giving away 0-6 month size , when my baby only 3 months old , it getting bit small .	1
this product works well my dr brown bottles . there holes it make it easy stand up inner parts bottles . much better looking than lot bottle drying racks . i use sassy rubber bristled bottle brush so it won't scratch bottles , though . sassy color totally coordinates perfectly	1
very convenient carseat , placed combi double stroller , which only side side stroller i seen you attach infant seat into . ( i've searched lot ) carseat comprable peg perego primo viaggo ( whichi also ) but you ; connect one into aria twin , peg perego side side . seat itself lightweight easy manage , very soft foam insert . it easy get into car or without base . only complaint would straps could little longer because you can't both baby bunting bag foam insert otherwise straps aren't long enough comfortably get baby out . also , our daughter extremely colicky 5 weeks 12 weeks would only sleep this carseat , so it must pretty comfortable	1
this bed hard put together but it well worth trouble . it great buy price . you can't go wrong if you little time patience put it together	1
when we got our changing table friend who no longer needed it ... they gave us diaper depot well . i love how it puts everything arms reach without clutting changing table . it lasted two kids before one it now , so total three babies . i guess like anything if it taken care properly it won't break	1
my 6 month old daughter just transitioned her infant seat carrier britax boulevard loving it . she looks comfortable it , i really appreciate side impact support case accident . i really see her growing into it well . it little large our camry but there still enough room one other person ( instead 2 ) backseat	1
i climber ! she could climb out her crib age 13 months . she way too young bed . we also crib tent ii both items allowed us feel our now 22 month old daughter safely her crib night -- not roaming her room or house while we sleep . it either these products or emptying all furniture out her room , putting mattress floor , putting lock her door night keep her safe . life saver	1
what great product . no tools , just click , click , click , it ready use . anchors keep unit place under mattress . frame metal not plastic ! i am very pleased quality , look . it out box , bed 10 minutes . :	1
i used both this product disposable kind stickers keep them table , i like both different reasons . disposable ones sort expensive , but very portable when i am flying visiting relatives . hippo one great grab go around town , when i am not concerned weight my diaper bag . i waiters thank me many restaurants ! just fold mess right up clean home ! my son way too young plate not toss it , i don't want him eating off table probably full nasty germs . this hippo really durable too , i used this same mat over 3 years , ( i first got it my daughter ) it still looks great	-1
i agree above reviewers . this rug large very well made . perfect any little girl room	1
we bought this trip we taking may but when my daughter saw it she got it immediately . she wants sit it watch tv , take walks or put her dolls it . light weight makes it easy take use more places me . this helps my back problems since i am more likely stoller me now . it easy open , shut lock . i wish it place hang or store smaller baby bag though . i also like ride smooth victoria she option reclined or sit upright . large padded hand grips help more control comfort stroller also .	1
this bib it all there no complaints whatsoever ! i used go through 8-10 bibs every few days , but now this only bib i use every day , all day ! easy wash , catches everything so there little mess or around my child it easy , easy off !	1
this gate some good points just one negative . pros - good price , easy operate . mine very easy batteries , i replace them every 2 months . they located kid bedroom doorways , 8 ' apart each other . we use them double safety top stairs , keep roaming 22 month old out his sister room when she wants some quiet time . those you who multiple gates complain 1 control unlocking both gates you should know if you replace batteries same time arm first gate it sends out signal both gates programs it unlock both . so simply set up one gate while batteries out other , then set up second gate seperately . i never them malfunction following these steps . cons : i also my toddler wedge knee door . i found this due gate not tight enough . it very frustrating little scary but we always able help him out gate sitting him down pulling him straight back . we nearly got rid this gate because few times dealing this . but since we tightened up pressure gate we no problems . it also stripped some paint my doorway where tension feet .. right down bare wood . i repaint patch when these gates come down . also should little taller imo , if gate not tight enough it become dislodged open . always check gate when you close it make sure it closed .. few rare occasions i found it not completely closed . this usually happens when you manually open gate then try use remote button open it . overall , 4 stars . would 5 stars if gate taller bars little closer prevent pinching . good price though it put together well	-1
we purchased this gate use our youngest four daughters . pressure gates we already difficult our 3 5 year olds get pass it gets difficult constantly lifting them over gate . this gate well worth money . remote unit wall place where everyone reach it , except 13 month old course . it so much easier everyone . all use our gate gets , spot welds broke one day . you really miss this gate when you go back using pressure gate again . i called customer support , concerned because i longer my receipt or even box . spot welds breaking loose problem they hadn't reported before ( so this apparently isn't common problem ! ) i told we would receive new gate within two weeks old one would inspected engineers determine what occured . i very impressed ! i sure check out evenflo products first when purchasing any new child/baby products their customer support alone . service like not so common anymore . like i said , great concept service	1
my husband i loved look shapes moblie . my baby face just lights up when he placed his bed naps or night time . however we find ourself running back forth so much because cute little songs stopped before he falls asleep . i looking online saw some these new mobiles remotes them . it would seem all new things come out manufactors would given public option wind up mobile or remote mobile . i hope someone these places reads these takes time put more thought into what parents would want future purchases . but like i said before we love look love they way my son reacts it . so i'll look this mobile weight loss bonus all running back forth	-1

our little one loved this toy until he turned 8 months . now its really challenge try get him into this thing or baby einstein stationary entertainer ( see my review ) . however , he still play it standing outside loves touching legs toys chewing bar . unfortunately he puts up fight when we try get him it . but we good run this it worth it . he would bounce back forth say " ahhhhhhh !

our daughter turning 2 years old this week i felt it time finally write review this amazing product . very beginning , she incredibly alert interested baby . she born c-section 38 weeks eyes hands wide open . once they finished cleaning her up , my husband i thrilled just cuddle her talk her while she looked us both wide eyes made little coo coo sounds . right away she great nursing very good latch . she rarely ever cried , when she , it quiet little " lay lay lay " sound , not wild waa-waa . throughout infancy she always capable adapting every situation quickly without emotional outburst . where it would seem other children would over-stimulated environment , she would thrive seem want more stimulation ! only three months age , people thought she older because her alertness interest people animals . she hit every developmental milestone months early , especially language ( sign speech ) , music appreciation , colors/shape/letter/number recognition . her pediatrician happily surprised her suggested i should five more just like her ! when we bought babyplus , we thought , " if it helps only 10% well testimonials say it , it worth it " . we're certain it contributed positively helping develop this little miracle ours . we're now expecting child #2 ( 25 weeks ) although not using baby plus could interesting experiment ( same gene pool , same parenting , etc . ) , we're too interested possibilities how much it may contribute our next child us withhold it .	1

this nice chair , except brakes . they lock so easily if you just barely brush them your foot , they lock . it seems all you look them they lock . since we constantly moving chair us , or back wall , etc ., this real problem because you unlock them ( esp . if more than one four locked ) order move chair easily . baby gets heavier heavier becomes toddler , this even harder . pleats bottom seat pad probably unnecessary definately hard get crumbs out . if it weren't brakes , i would give it 5 stars . toy aquarium nice except they could make large push pads which make fish move around water , easier little ones push	-1

sadly , i too found kwik cabana iii terrific item ... first time i set it up ( inside our house , course ) . when we actually took it beach tried open it up under " real world " conditions - jersey shore early september , not particularly windy - one four support rods snapped top junction . we now own $100 collection poles fabric , but not cabana . it too bad , because it really great design so lightweight . hopefully manufacturer design stronger version ( which i'd buy again )	-1
i looked this swing alot before buying loved it pink light but hated spending much swing . we jungle swing but she wouldnt sit it she didnt like anything so i said i going try this i didnt care how much it cost if she would sit it . course soon i got it i put it together couldnt wait my husband easy she loves it she just coo laugh i love this swing so she i would reccomend this anyone looking it	1
i ordered baby swing amazon cost me $114.00 total all other stores carried it $159.00 plus shipping tax . we so impressed how fast item came perfect condition . only way you could get it other stores line also , so i figured i saved little over $60.00 . thank you amazon making our present our first grand daughter pleasant one	1
i love this stroller . it came it exactely what i wanted . amazon got it here very quickly promised . i am very satisfied my purchase	1
goregous stroller !!!! we those cheapo umbrella strollers but our 2 1/2 year old tall it , it wasnt wide enough , she looked very squished . this came mail today its perfect !!! light weight , tall handles light padding , nice break system , beautiful colors/materials , our toddler not squished she plenty room ( shes 35lbs , 37 " tall)i dont feel hunched when i walk it , great place storage pouch , wide long canopy . its just perfect well worth $$ . im buying our new son when hes old enough . great deal !!!! buy one !!!!! :) im very happy	1
while my 4 yr old potty trained since she 2-1/2 , she wasn't making it thru night so we used pull up every night . shortly after she turned 4 she started waking up dry pull ups . we gave it few weeks make sure it wasn't fluke then invested * two * these pads . tuck feature both sides great i find it stay place even after nights sleep . she finds it comfortable she never complained it ( course , princess sheets accomanied this new pad encourage acceptance we made huge deal her giving up pull ups sleeping regular underwear ) . best part this design if there accident , you just whip it off ( any other top sheet might gotten wet ) tuck dry one . no changing fitted sheet middle night . us , if top sheet or blanket gets wet , i've got second comforter/blanket her closet quickly throw over her . ( course pajama changing can't avoided ) helps get everyone back sleep fast possible . i've washed them number times they come out dryer same shape every time ( follow washing instructions ) . size also generous . i worried she might move off pad during night , but proper placement where she normally sleeps most night , we've never problem . it says it absorbs 6 cups ; while we haven't tested , i've never found pad dripping , so all urine securely soaked . we haven't found down side these pads . even price isn't bad -- i some price comparison maybe you'll find them few bucks less , but not much . , if i may add bit my own potty training 2-cents , my husband wanted her give up pull ups much earlier , but i no mood change sheets ( or these pads ) * every * night . i've read most toddlers ' bladders aren't large enough make it thru night anyway , so i just happy let it happen naturally . way , everyone happy ( well i you know what they say mamma happy -- everyone happy ! ) thus , i highly recommend this pad anyone going down no-more-pull-ups road . i am sure it would just useful any older child ( parents ) dealing bed-wetting problem .	1
this purchased gift our daughter , but too big shipped us overseas . so it remained my mothers house until we came visit . ever since we put it together ( which very easy ) she played it everday . she likes it so much we placing it our suitcases take back overseas us . easy disassemble well so we took it us visit in-laws north carolina , which gave her plenty . it also served feeding chair while we visiting .	-1

finally product fisher price worth money !! these second set fisher price monitors we purchased loving them - unlike first set . we especially love 10 different channels select , reception display , battery display , rechargable batteries , low battery alarm , terminal/reciever disconnection alarm , most all clear sound no static . we struggled months model monitors fisher price ultimately ended up purchasing these upon recommendation family . we glad ditch other ones completely happy these !	1
i too am very pleased this gate . over past week i installed one each top our two staircases . i strongly recommend following advice one other reviewers skip using template . lower fixture hinge side lowest ground , so i installed first , then held it place mark spot upper hinge . after , i put gate hinges , held it place marked opposite side . worked great , it allowed me work around mouldings , which would difficult template . wood screws held great one bannister one staircase . other staircase , i put gates into drywall . there beam one side , so i buy much longer screws ensure tight grip . other side hollow , so i bought some good metal anchors , so gate very tight . all i bring fixtures hardware store found screws anchors would fit holes . cost me $10 get enough anchors screws four gates . most poor reviews sound like there some hardware issues . i take one star away because i think gate should come alternate screws , maybe anchors , because i think it bad assumption most people installing into wood . i would very much recommend this gate , but advise paying close attention what you're installing into first make sure you've got right hardware	-1
i lot research 2 1/2 yrs ago gate top our stairs when we our little girl . i now 2 1/2 yr old 10 mo old , they shake it stand it , but it secured wall they can't open it . we buying 2nd one bottom our stairs our new house	1

we using these diapers our daughter birth currently 5 months old . they never leaked runny breastfed poop . would get soaked if we didn't change her often enough , but she may supersoaker ! they very soft stretchy , never leave red marks her leg . lots snaps fit all sized babies . they take while dry . we wash ours , then cycle dryer then hang finish drying . overall great diaper . would recommend anyone wanting try cloth diapers first time	1
this little kit two one . it all you need grooming all you need baby health . only thing we don't use clippers because we like one 1st years magnifing glass . comb brush perfect , she absolutely loves rattle ! surprise ! i thought it just kind extra , but we take it us everywhere . suction bulb isn't bad like others said . case it comes really great ! it pocket storing other things back which we use nose drops , tylenol , etc . it all one place great because we easily grab it go if we going grandma . i'm sure we'll using this into her toddler years !	-1
i recently purchased this potty my 16 month old son . we not actively training but i wanted introduce him it . first night i got it , he went pee pee boo boo it . i screamed clapped sang little song . he really likes it . he even brought it out bathroom took it into living room watch wiggles while sitting it . i like color , how it fits his size . he sit it get up all himself . its very sturdy , it doesn't wobble or tip over like some . one reviewer said sprout little short , but i haven't problem . my son tends look down himself while he going , so everything pointing south anyway . i love there only 2 pieces this chair . very easy clean . i safety 1st chair flip top lid detachable sprout i absolutely hated this thing . my son would pull sprout walk around house it . he too concerned lid turning around chair pull lid up down instead concentrating trying go potty . baby bjorn there no distractions , no music , no removable pieces(except bowl)which allows him focus going potty . i just really like this potty chair . i would highly recommend this chair	1
this neoprene organizer best ! i didn't know how much stuff i wasn't bringing until i got it . now i am always remembering stuff organizer stroller car . it really handy , highly recommende	1
we purchased this gate fit around base odd shaped staircase ( those interested , it front stairwell wellington plan centex homes - it really popular down here centex subdivisions so i thought i'd share ) . i concerned finding anything would cover this area because odd shape but this gate job spades . it breeze install ( least compared some other gates ) . i it installed within 1 hour . usual these kind things , if you installing into sheetrock , forewarned anchors come gate hardware pooky you need buy some decent ones hardware store . that really my only complaint , but it seems always case any factory-provided hardware these days . we very pleased it it worth money .	1
my husband i bought this gate keep our precocious exceptionally curious toddler out kitchen . ( it took her week figure out how open all safety locks cabinets . ) when gate arrived box heavily damaged gate broken . we called customer service summer they new gate free return shipping label us three days ! installation fairly easy my husband who not particularly handy tools . we like fabric/mesh since our daughter can't climb it like other gates . only thing i don't like quite so much latching mechanism not terribly easy use . you line up gate then pull slightly handle seat latch properly . takes little while get used . all-in-all we would definitely recommend this gate others who large openings close off	1
it gave me piece mind my son safe . it also fits bassinet i purchased . one thing it needs little wedge so my son head elevated but all all this great piece item . it nice know pieces moved around so you custom fit it your child growth spurt	1

this third potty i've purchased my son . first one made parents , it tipped over first time my son sat it . second first years elmo 3-in-1 , cup pinched his behind 3 places leaving cuts . this one great . although my son hesitant go it first ( which i attribute his experience elmo potty ) , he fits nicely it . other potties too narrow front back , i adjust him several times get him situtated so he could use front guard . seat lifts out cup which lends itself not pinching his bottom ; easy clean up . it low enough ground his legs fit too . back arm supports fit well also . it solid construction good buy .	1
this best baby item i purchased ! i fit it also , i sit play gate watch tv while my baby plays . he can't get tv or anything else so much room he not now he confined . it folds up just second closet it goes . also works puppies , kittens even baby goats !	1

i used this stroller first time yesterday , i can't say enough good things it . i also graco quattro macleran volo , bob definitely most versatile stroller three . i steer it one hand while handling my dog other hand . jogging stroller breeze , basic functions stroller . i assembled it no problem , it very easy fold unfold . it weighs same graco stores similarly graco . my son loved graco , but i found it hard handle i couldn't run it . he hates volo b/c he can't sit up it . although bob more similar volo than graco far seating position goes , my son doesn't seem mind it . i think it supports him well . it plenty storage , i also purchased handle bar console . orange color nice , brown contrast . i live minnesota , this thing plows through snow without any problem . i'm very happy this purchase .	1
it took one 2-year old supervisor 3 adults get this bed put together . this bed not come support mattress . however , you buy piece board material covering it toys us $38 . it worth money . our son loves bed . it very sturdy . headboard where you store " books " little bit shaky but nobody going sitting up there . he also loves area where you roll cars down . mom likes it o.o ne area , headboard , horrible put together because plastic not molded well it could . headboard four areas where you needed push thru then push it down stay intake . we ended up using oil kitchen get this accomplished like reviewer	-1

i originally bought britax boulevard my son who 2 out growing his regular convertable carseat . he 35 pounds needed seat would " fit " him . seat not so great . i sold it bought this one instead . i bought zebra print . seat big heavy , which i like since it looks feels so safe . i like instructions attached seat so you can't lose them . seat easy adjust fit my son very very easy install into my very small car ( suzuki esteem ) . after installing it seatbelt it not move all ... which we all know safe . installation so fast . i love belt lock offs . seat very plush soft . i love many covers available . my son sits comfortably this seat , there plenty room grow , crotch strap so much better this ( than boulevard ) i am sure we going able use this seat years come . i am so glad i found this . buy it , you not disappointed	1
when my son 5 months old , he almost too tall his infant carseat so my husband i started looking seat would last him until he old enough ride without one . initially , i wanted britax , but i didn't know anyone who one i really afraid spend $300 ( including tax ) seat . so we bought eddie bauer . i didn't hate it , it ok , but it not fit our car ( toyota rav-4 ) . so we gave seat my mother so she could use it occaision when she babysits we bit bullet bought britax - oh my gosh . we love it ! it installed like 2 minutes , i'm not kidding . i could not believe how simple it . my son ( who now 6 months ) loves it - he so comfy he sleep it without his head leaning way over like it eddie bauer . he never cries when he it - it sits up straight enough he look around which he also loves . fabric feels so wonderful wipes clean pretty easily . i love one hand strap adjustment velcro holds straps out way boarding . we're planning plane trip may , i tell you we'll taking this seat . when our next baby arrives , he or she riding britax . they rock	1
i'm grandma didn't want high chair sitting my kitchen when i only use it occasionally . this seat great bargain . i like it fit any chair adjusted different angles . fabric cover easy wipe clean cushion provides sufficient padding . i considered one seats slide over counter or table , but decided this one because i baby facing me directly . this makes easy feeding . i am very happy feeding seat	-1

i am very pleased this sun shade . when i first received it i thought i got scammed because it looks like nothing . but it job very effectively . it super easy attach when not needed shade pulls back out way . depending angle sun , i it partially or fully extended . i've used ours almost year it held its shape . it also packs up very compactly traveling . it best i've found maximum sun coverage . it fits both my full size evenflo travel system stroller my lightweight peg aria , which very small canopy . my recommendation my cousin got one it works her full size her small zooper also . i've read other reviews complaining it doesn't fit but i've tried it many strollers friends it works . i think you just need creative how you tie it stroller . i expect this shade work most strollers . i see some kids may dislike reduced field view when shade fully extended . i started using it when my daughter only 3 months old so i think she got used it . she never problem reduced view . my cousin started using it recently her 11 mos old her baby doesn't fuss either . i now give this sun shade every friend young kids . it great inexpensive shower gift . it one those things you can't live without once you it	1

we several these various sizes fabrics . they all terrific . we're using fleece night winter , quilt during day winter we used cotton one fall . i highly recommend this line wearable blankets	1
very reliable item i used more then two years . i very happy simplicity ease use . i am surprized see this excellent product such low price . you can't go wrong .. go it	1
it nice thick keeps baby warm . only thing i would like different top held place elastic it would better if it fitted more snug top so it wouldn'tg slide down . but would recommend this product keep your toddler warm .	-1
this blanket great ! most meaningful me it waterproof , so even if ground wet , i'm not . it pretty easy spot clean wet wipe , but you also put it commercial-sized washer ( i've yet this ) . folds compactly carry strap .	1
when i bought this , i got " oh great ... more stuff won't ever get used clutter up my house " look my husband , which i reminded him tonight . i buy it prematurely- our almost 3 year old wasn't remotely interested using any potty , so it sit around while . but ever since she started using potty ( first hers , now ours w/ her seat ) , we taken it us everywhere . not just sanitary reasons , but every bit much size . we also use it pottys her grandparents ' houses or my husband office potty which we're only ones use . couple times ( tonight included ) we've forgotten it she go public , it nightmare . first there layers seat covers , then even worse trying position her little behind enormous seat big ol ' opening front which means her legs out angle so she doesn't end up right there . then she says it hurts all her weight two places where seat goes across her . yes , i pinched myself beginning when we hurry i didn't it down yet how it folded , but it well worth it my eyes . bottom line- i love it , i highly recommend it , i would totally lost without it . so worth three times ( more ) what i paid it	1
my mother law gave us this boppy , i am glad she . it easy run out new things young baby . so this nice pull out put floor let our little tommy experience pillow under his chest . i also put him his belly nothing under it so he experiance well . this interesting because bright colors toys attached . so far he isnt paying attention toys , but he still only just learning use his hands . so i am sure next couple months toys become more usefull . i like place brightlly colored book front him , he enjoys something his level look . he gets tired laying this pillow pretty fast , but our guy supper picky gets bored fast . also it small enough it stored out sight very easily . i think this makes great addition any collection	1
this boppy makes tummy time easy fun . pillow right size babies , makes tummy time no brainer	1
this product just simple ..... it everything it claims . our grandson much more comfortable , so means everybody else house too . it just so nice find product exactly what it supposed	1
our baby doesn't get gassy too much ( just few times per month ) , but when he , he straightens his legs screams nothing calms him . except gripe water , course ! within 30 minutes taking his dose he over it back normal . i also feel much better giving him this versus other anti-gas medicine , which actually drug	1
i purchased two other sleep positioners didn't work until i came across this one . my daughter snuggles into this sleeps so peacefully . i love you adjust this according baby size , sides positioner aren't velcro so they always stay place . highly recommended	1
our little one head small size she rapidly outgrowing hat . jacket fits fine - only fastens top . cute soft . don't order it if your baby average or large sized head	-1
my 8 mo . old loves this toy . it big , blue elephant makes noise when you spin his tummy or his tail . shapes big colorful they tumble out when you press his trunk or ears . she just loves it i think it cutest shape sorter i've seen . it just not very compact , but it very cute	1
great toilet trainer my daughter , handles help my daughter her balance while potty when uses adult toilet	1
this pad performed expected extra length sides makes it easier tuck under mattress keep it moving . however , photo gives impression covering more bed than it truly . take measurements seriously - don't rely photo . i needed play it see where bed it would most effective	-1
we bought two these our toddler who going his " big boy " bed first time . i love them !! they so easy change middle night when his diaper leaks they held up numerous washings . they hold ton liquid haven't leaked once . we'll buying more our older son who going try make it through night no pull-up !! great buy !	1
we bought rainforest peek-a-boo when we vacation because we forgot bring our usual soother . rainforest peek-a-boo great . our 5 month old fascinated it . soother its job terms helping him sleep . however , timer feature could improved . our son falls asleep better light sound . unfortunately longer , 18 minute , setting sound only . overall fisher-price rainforest very good product i would recommend	-1
my baby girl loves this ! it puts her right sleep every time . music it very soothing fun listen . highly recomended	1
i able take my little one out running stroller 7 weeks using snuzzler . i stuck smooth bike paths until she 4 months , but her little head didn't budge when she laying this thing . fact , i think she slept better running stroller w/ snuzzler than home ! two sides convenient b/c you just flip it over depending kind weather you're : fleece side keep her warm other keep her cool when it already warm out . 4 months , she didn't need it car seat or swing anymore , but it still seems comfy her running stroller even now 5 months	1
we live florida . it almost july . our newborn loves this thing . she currently happier her carseat snuzzler than anywhere . one side cozy fleece -- which would great cool weather , but not what we need . reverse navy fabric , it plenty cozy . it supports her head , so her head always upright , even long tripsand it gently supports her back arms . i rate this " must-have "	1
i six months pregnant twins , broken leg not-quite three year old who figured out pretty quickly he could outrun mama . when he nearly ran into parking lot , i bought this item because his safety my number one concern . when my son started getting rowdy crowded public location , i able slip this harness him very quickly easily because strategically placed velcro . i anticipated some snide comments passerbys , but not expect my son give me baleful look announce ( loudly ): " i not puppy , mama ! " needless say , my son not like it one bit but it comfortable doesn't restrict arms . it very good product , but it requires practicing your child before it effective because velcro give if you your child try go opposite directions	-1
we decided use cloth diapers because it so much cheaper than disposables . prefolded diaper service diapers definately way go too . i couldn't it if i fuss folding . also - if you plan cloth diaper - must 4 - 6 diaper wraps ( 10$ 2 @ bbrus ) . they like plastic pants only waterproof cloth covering . they also velcro instead pins . my hubby ( who hates wrapping anything ) loves offers change our newborn diapers since he easily handle velcro wraps . we diaper cleaning service first 2 months , i clean them my own since . it really not difficult everyone thinks it . plus it great environment . i strongly recommend cloth diapers wraps	1
these absorbant diapers they hold up regular abuse washing over over again . they need washed several times before they soft . i need mention if you choose cloth diaper your baby , you might want just use velcro covers first since weave very tight this diaper . i used pins , first , got frustrated , because they wouldn't go through diaper . after few washings , weave loosened bit i able pin them more easily	-1
we bought car seat our granddaughter . it real bargain , very safe , functional good long time attractive . only downside it challenge install it initially fit our granddaughter .	-1
our oldest child ready use booster seat ! i tired transferring car seats minivan my wrx whenever i wanted take our oldest me my car . so we bought this booter seat stay wrx trunk until needed . it works great ! it comfy my daughter , light weight , very easy use . we surprised , it much bigger real life it looks photos , ours colors reversed . dark blue fabric center light blue outside . cup holders awesome better quality than you think 20 bux would get you . we very impressed buying one other three kids grow out their car seats ! also , this one few boosters qualifies free shipping	1
i used fleece sleepsacks winter but needed something lighter spring summer . these cotton sacks great - no need blanket hence no worries baby smothering herlself	1
we love this wearable blanket so much we bought every kind . they wonderful . first i must say they , obviously , not confine arms , so if your baby still gets startled her jerky arm movements when trying fall asleep he/she may not ready this yet . i am slowly making transition miracle blanket over this . my baby still needs extra swaddling night when she fussy , but she likes freedom during her naps this provides likes get her fingers too . i not find my cotton sleep sack shrank . zipper doesn't lay exactly flat her , but i haven't found this problem all . i feel sizes run bit small . my baby wearing small size 23 " just outgrown it . i'd recommend getting them one size above what you think you need . i don't like there no arm sleeves all . i really would liked choice putting her one or without sleeves . this cotton so nice light i can't imagine it any lighter without fragle hold together . if you want one heavier , they come fleece quilted also , but remember there no sleeves . i very much like zipper " upside down " . it undoes bottom which means you don't completely unzip your baby diaper changes zipper tab doesn't poke into baby chin . btw , if you try put your baby arms inside sack instead out holes they probably get them out holes themselves - mine .	1
after tried every bottle brand we could find , we ended up preferring dr. brown . they definitely reduced amount gas our baby swallowing thus reducing amount spit up burps . measurements bottles spot , thus mixing formula them really easy . bottles very durable nipples . they take beating still look brand new , including measurement markings . i'm fairly certain bottles we last until our baby eating just solid food . yeah , parts pain clean . but we live . it not huge , huge deal . i say playtex disposables just good terms gas prevention , but we didn't feel good throwing away all those plastic containers added cost purchasing them . well , measurements them wildly inaccurate thus totally useless	-1
i bought this swing my granddaughter . it very easy get her out . she enjoys it . it make soft clicking sound similiar ticking clock . i think it good deal price	-1
love this product . it easy use , easy take , clean up cinch . no worries what table under topper . we've three restaurant employess ( different restaurants ) ask product their customers little ones	1
this system great . only used it 2 months now but its fantastic . fits into our crv perfectly . its not heavey some others very safe . we used it several airline trips so far car seat fits great plane . i would recommend anyone	1
purchased upstairs nursery , it saved me stumbling downstairs kitchen late night/early morning feedings . fits avent well thinner bottles . i recommend using caps come your bottles when you warm up junior food ( repels condensation ) . i'd give it five stars , but beeps feature i wish could turned off user - note munchkin . worth every penny	-1
after doing research , i picked munchkin bottle warmer . good things this warmer quick , enough heat , good size ( we use avent bottle ) , easy care best thing auto shut off . we using 4 months day night without any problem . people compliant water adjustment , i usually use low level , my son never compliant	1
i used stroller only couple times try it out , my grandaughter still too young it . i like item very much . ii well designed , light , yet sturdy . i'm satisfied quality product look forward use it lot soon	-1
this lightest easiest stroller . it small enough stash trunk still able buy groceries . if my son decides he doesn't want ride it , it light enough fold up carry my shoulder . i like there sun shade i love 5-point harness , i used rain bonnet once marathon , i only one without wet kid . seat also angled towards back so child doesn't slide right out when you release buckes like some strollers . zippers both sides recline sleeping . it make slightly reclined chair , but he doesn't mind . very well made sturdy , mine through lot . i owned it 1 1/2 years no problems	1
this tub great if you dont want confine your child too much full sized bathtub , but also small enough keep it safe baby . since it blow up tub , all sides soft so baby wont bonk her head . there drain hole one end easy draining , suction cup underneath so you hang it up when not use . it also good if you going trip not sure if there tub give baby bath	-1
these bottles good choice if you're breastfeeding , but introduce bottle . my son never problem going breast this bottle back breast again . also , after months frequent use , i never experienced leaking problem these bottles mentioned some other reviewers . i also know other moms who used these more than year no leaks either . i even taken tops apart put them back together still no leaks	1
my baby now 3 weeks old , this his favorite chair . it actually doubling his bed right now , because it only thing i use get him sleep more than hour time ! i guess it little loud , but i think that what keeps baby sleeping ! love it	1
i think soothing motions glider great product . my 6 week old daughter loves it , she slept many hours it so far . it very soothing her . however , there doesn't seem much difference two speeds , noise get bit annoying . i can't say much music - i wish it bit more soothing her . regardless , she seems love it . we put it our coffee table so our dog doesn't lick her pieces ;) it very stable product	-1
haven't baby yet , but played this . easy set up . it make noise but low mechanical noise , which may soothing baby . i'm not sure if it suppose make kind noise . it not noticable music going . it moves steady slow . i think baby like it , i hope . i rated it 4 because noise	-1
we went swaddle blanket these sleep sacks . my daughter loves them . she still doesn't know how use blanket but doesn't need one sleep sack . i can't find xl stores - only online . i don't know what when she outgrows xl ...	1
after losing one daughter sids , i now worry everything . these blankets help ease my mind . i never liked idea receiving blankets because baby easily move her hands pull blank over her head . blankets provide warmth without risk going over her head . i usually put my daughter her p.j.s blanket , but really warm nights i just put her this . plus it sack it allows her move her feet around freely , which isn't case when she wears feet p.j.s because all her kicking her legs either get caught up croch area or p.j.s get twisted around . benefit this only product seal approval national sids alliance .	1
this very nice mattress seems very firm , which good baby . however , vinyl covering blue white check , which seen through sheets . this feature not readily visable product photograph unless you select other pictures feature . also , there small tear binding edge mattress . our first mattress white , therefore there not pattern seen through sheets . good solution use mattress pad	-1
diaper genie ii works phenomenally . i would definitely recommend this product anyone who baby or expecting . it easy use , sturdy , exactly what it says it ; it locks odors keeps your house smelling like used diaper .	1

how much you write high chair ? my daughter fits seat . it looks comfortable , though i haven't tried it myself yet . tray goes off fairly easy one hand . looking hardware though doesn't give me much confidence this last more than one child . tray insert works well makes clean up much easier . would nice if they included 2 inserts , but i guess just one makes sure i clean it sooner . my daughter loves toy attaches tray . it really helps keep her amused while we prep her food she goes out her way hunt it down when she just playing not seat . assembly fairly easy instructions clear . i amazed they able break this down into many parts they . if you liked erector sets kid you'll like putting this together . it took 30 minutes hardly any foul language	1

we using this tud my baby since she 4wks old , she love tud , baby very safe tud , her head always above water , so there no water going her ear . she love tud so much , everytime when we get her out , she start cry , if we put her back , she stop . great price , good first time mom	1
i bought these sheets because other reviews stating thinner sheets horrible . these other hand nice soft . i washed dried these sheets ( because i didn't read instructions ) after reading few comments sheets don't fit after drying decided break them out try them myself . since our baby isn't due 6 weeks i didn't these things out yet ( because cat would think i set it up him ) . well , i only took out " mattress " if you . proceeded try put both sheets ( just make sure ) . it tight fit but i also figured it would since bunching around baby face not something i would wanted anyways . well sheets fit ( least " mattress " out my bed rather than travel crib itself . but it probably would easier make it way anyway . hope this helps	1
this great toy box . it holds ton toys very sturdy	-1
i purchased this toy box my son room . colors great they match his decor perfectly . it very roomy . it holds more toys than i anticipated . two storage bins underneath life saver . i put all his small toys them he access them easily . only reason i gave it 4 stars because lid doesn't stay up well . it sometimes fall . when he using his toy box , i just take lid off prevent accidents .	-1
i bought snug tub deluxe when my baby outgrew her infant tub she lay down . she slipping sliding all over " big " tub , so this perfect solution allow her sit play smaller , more comfortable area than full tub . easy use , dries quickly , worked great us	1
i love this soft tub . no hard platic egdes . other problem i traditional infant tub my baby outgrew it fast . i use this tub bath sling my baby cannot sit up her own yet . when she sit her own , i use tub alone . i one complaint . suction cup used hang tub fell off after minimal use i not get it back	-1

i tried couple other slings didn't work me . i didn't like over shoulder baby holder type one because i could never get it right . i snuggly type one which okay but still hard my back . this one lengthy but worth it once you used it become quick it . i found if i want work computer it great he sleeps my chest , snuggled up , i type both hands . i not tried nurse it so i am not sure how well works . i used it front tummy facing . my husband even wore it while cooking found it handy	1
i buy this baby wrap through e-bay because amazon would not ship outside us . my baby loves it , we flew dublin london both ways you would not know there baby flight , because she slept through whole journey . she just loves it , she falls asleep everytime i put her it . she just over 2 months old weighs nearly 11 pounds . it so comfortable , i actually went 1 mile walk her other day not feel strain my shoulders . i tried other baby carriers , regular ones like hell , luckily i only borrowed it not bought one , it dug into my shoulders left me aching day . wrap soft , it keeps baby warm winter cool summer it made out cotton lycra . most importantly it comfortable wear both mum/dad baby . highly recommended ! i usually don't write reviews but i just mention something wrap because i'm absolutely over moon it . way it really easy put , it only took me couple minutes get hang it	1

i owned two these warmers 5 years now -- they consistently plugged they still working !! these gadgets make it so much easier pull wipes out when you need them , they also nice warm baby . i love fact you use any type baby wipe them , if wipes happen dry out you add ordinary water warmer rehydrate them . excellent investment !	1
when i my oldest , i not this product . he often got upset when changed which resulted him crying . it always took while calm him down . i recieved this gift pleasently suprised . my wipes never turn brown or dry out long i use thick wipe such huggies wipes . my son tooshie stays warm it also wipes off easier . result your child staying calm happy . i think it works billion times better than holding it your hand who wants hold them your hand warm when so often you need one right after . i think it not luxery , but necessity	1
i enjoyed this my baby . but they grow out this rather quickly .	-1
when we brought our daughter home all we one those tiny little head supports . well she only 6lbs birth it wasn't very good support her . freind bought this her we love it . i don't worry her sliding around her carseat all . it kinda hugs them . she snug bug there . i love this would recommend this everyone bring their newborn home	1

love this gate - we 2 blocking stairs kitchen . one comment installation - you must use measure tape/ruler they provide locate where gate hinges fastened wall , that why top pop out ( earlier review ) . eyeballing it not way fasten it . there specific heights install make this gate safe . purchasing one top stairs well , no doubt it fine . they provide good long screws , so long you banister or stud , you'll fine .	1
i loved this gate so much , i bought two . i use one mounted wall other tension mount without hardware , either way , they both work great keeping our little monster off stairs . highly recommended	1
bumper useful prevents our son getting his arms legs through crib slats regular basis while providing breathable barrier case he rolls over his face against bumper . my only complaint it slides down fairly easily , especially when baby gets his leg top it ( while laying his side , not standing ) or grabs it . it needs readjusted tightened frequently . nevertheless , we sleep better knowing he doesn't his face thick quilted bumper . it really beathable- i put my own nose mouth it before installation check	-1
i somewhat hesitant purchase after reading review describing how seat would become loose or could not secured tightly . but , other reviews seemed positive so i decided give it try . i not any problems . i able secure seat very tightly no movement all .	-1

this tub worth every penny ! it large , but i keep it under crib where it out way easily accessed . best thing this tub how it holds small baby place while you bathe him or her . my baby 4 weeks old but i'm sure i'll continue like it he grows	1
we purchased this anticipation our trip yellowstone next year . pack very comfortable when adjusted correctly . i find if you adjust it right , most weight placed your hips . our 9 month old girl loves ride it . she even fell asleep once . she seems like rhythm our walk even " sings " she gets bounced around . we worried she wouldnt like it because she pretty difficult baby ( she born acid reflux ) . however , we it several months now she makes no complaint when we load her up . she doesnt even mind sitting pack when it ground . i very short hair baby likes try grab it ( too short really grab ) . interesting enough , she never tries grab my wife hair . i would suppose you may want invest hat if your baby likes pull hair . there lots pockets , although if you wearing pack , pockets very difficult access , even ones hip . hip pockets seem too far back ( i 38 " waist ) . my wife smaller waist doesnt seem problem waist pockets i . when taking off pack , baby seemed secure getting her off no problem . we dont use hood . its not too difficult put . just takes little time figure it out . i am 5'10 " waist belt near lowest setting just right me . my wife 5'7 " she likes waist belt setting near middle-top . first , it felt awkward walking weight , but after couple walks , we got used it . now we fight who gets wear pack when we walk . im glad we got pack . we cant wait till we get load her up yellowstone	1
i got four these sleepsacks , two fleece two cotton . i found fleece sleepsacks get bitty after couple washes , but it didn't effect product . they wonderful . if you buying newborn , get 6-12 month size , since it'll last bit longer . i ended up giving away 0-6 month size , when my baby only 3 months old , it getting bit small .	1
like any parent , i concerned sids so sleepsack seemed like perfect alternative blankets . little i know , i would come love sleepsack it warming capabilities . after few months under their belt , babies get very squirmy middle night , so blankets useless ( dangerous ) . so i relied heavily sleepsacks keep my little guy warm , even after risk sids passed . they come fleece winter months cotton warmer months , they're generous size , so they not outgrown easily . i only wish i'd purchased them yellow or white , case my next baby opposite sex	1
i love this breast pump . i only wish i bought it sooner . i bought cheap breast pump first , but it broke down after only month use . due daycare issues , i leave my son my parents week , so i pump exclusively . after second day cheap pump , my milk production cut half 3 oz total both sides every 3 hours . then i wait longer even get much ! i went out bought this pump out desperation couldn't happier . it took me 4 pumping sessions my body get into rhythm , but then it great . i started pumping more milk less time than cheap pump . now i use pump 2-3 times day work occasionally weekends . couple tips : if you larger breasts , buy larger shields . i am cup 27 mm shields perfect me . soon i switched larger shields , minor discomfort i pumping went away i started getting ounce milk out each side same amount time . also , use dual function , turn pump before you put shields your breast . i've doing i haven't problem positioning them correctly pump . i've never problem cleaning pieces . i make sure give pieces really good washing once day , but each pumping , i wash everything quick soap my hand let it dry . i've never problem pieces not drying time before next pumping . also , when i bought my pump , they included extra set membranes . you also buy microwave sterilization bags medela clean everything , including membranes , which can't go dishwasher . also , since pump works any bottle , you don't continually wash one bottle use pump . i just stick nipples bottles i pumped take them daycare , then grab next set clean bottles out cabinet next day . i must say , this pump saved my milk supply . i even freezer full extra breastmilk . even though it much more expensive than some other pumps , i've saved more than its cost formula , so it worth it financially , not mention extra benefits breastmilk my son continued . i plan keeping mine my next child i would definitely recommend this product other moms	1
this pump works great me working mom . it looks professional i even fit my lunch top . i also love how quickly i set it up my office pump . it bit loud so don't try use it conference calls unless you hide it under you desk close flap . even then you'll want check it friend listening phone it first . our battery pack didn't work first we didn't check it until we road , so check yours . white membranes also must kept very clean yellow tips they go . even little bit old milk completely kill suction . but it worth it even this issue . buy it your lactation nurse hospital then you someone give you guidance how use it deal any issues you parts . although you shouldn't many .	1
4-1/2 stars !!! i would given it full 5 stars if it fit my toilet better . i kind slide-cram it into place , but it sturdy flexible enough take it(thank goodness ) . it definetly taken some hassel out potty training . it already there just flip down just easy clean i'm cleaning rest toilet . i would fully reccomend this gift any house children frequent !	-1
this product wonderful . i love fact it all attatched cannot fall off when baby kicks . only dislike i top sometimes blows off baby face when it windy . wouldn't so bad if i extra hand hold it down , but i also 2yr old . i wish there some way it staying down it own	-1
my friend recent mom , she so busy sometimes she no time clean bottles . her favor got her pack , but you still go through these one day	1
our baby only 5 days old , but so far it good carseat . i like colors design . it seems safe easy use	1
first time our son saw this toy he loved it . it made it much easier transition him crib his bassinette . it would nice if ocean sounds would play longer , like music , but john really enjoys music .	1
i used lots different bottles my two kids . these bottles far very best venting keep air minimum babies tummy . yes , they pain wash but after switching evenflo glass bottles due plastic bottle scare currently news i tons problems evenflo nipples . i bought three different packages all least one defective nipple package ( they not venting nipple collapes- supposedly they designed not this ) . evenflo supposed sending me one replacement package but it still hasnt arrived ! i havent told them yet two more packages nipples also contain defective nipples . all pains nipples collapsing while using glass bottles evenflo i think i would rather just go through pain washing dr browns ( our pediatrician said she no concerns plastic bottle scares ) . i never problem before nipples collapsing dr browns or avent bottles i used . stay away evenflo their quality assurance department not even close dr browns	1
these best bottles i tried yet . thing makes them unique they really prevent air bubbles coming better than any other bottle we've tried . only negative i see there several pieces which makes washing bit nuissance - still , it worth it if you patience wash day !	-1
it easier keep sheet clean than try keep cleaning cushion pack ' play . i'll admit workmanship this sheet isn't top notch , but it serves its purpose . if i interested sewing , i could make one looks just good this one , but i don't/won't sew . got second sheet pack ' play grandma house . gotta sheet	-1
although my 11 month old son terrified this tub first , he used it now loves it ! he not enjoy taking bath before i bought tub , now he likes ducky tub , he blast taking bath ! i would recommend this product	1
i 3 these ( yellow , blue , green ) . 3 plenty , 1 used , 1 laundered , 1 extra just case . my son now 20 months old they still great condition . he no longer uses changing pad , but there lots more use left them younger siblings . they shrink up little after washed little tight changing pad . other than they great	1
this third one we've purchased . all child safety gates we've seen , this seems sturdiest bunch . we've using them 2 1/2 years very satisfied . trick align closing point so it latch when you swing gate closed . if its not aligned , gate bounce back .	1
i love this gate/gate extension . this best one i've ever used . i've through nieces , nephews , step-nephews , now great nephew all gates used our families this far best one . it convenient very sturdy . you cannot go wrong this product . this last very long time	1
we bought two these extensions hands free gate we use our triplets just turned year old . this gate including extensions lifesaver ! you read my review gate well , lol . extensions very easy add very sturday . adding them not make gate weaker extending it out like some gates . it just what it states , extension . it keeps it just strong sturdy ! worth money	1
i give my baby frozen breastmilk used this warmer get milk ready her . it works great . i just pop bottle fill warmer water wait 4 minutes ( 5 oz bottles ) voila ! milk warm but not hot .	1

product exactly decsribed , quality materials , fits perfect , what child doen't want rubber ducky tub area	1
this tub fabulous ! we love it just simple ... no bells whistles ... just great sturdy tub . it folds up so not take up much room when stored , opening bottom drain water out , fits great kitchen sink holds baby great position bathing . we use it one those yellow bear spongy thingies , baby supported , semi-reclined very , very comfy ! worth every penny	1
i love this product . i've ep-ing my preemie 6+ months now kept my sanity because this product . i've tried other hands free methods like using my nursing bra flap keep it place ( doesn't work me ) easy expressions bustier which lot people love , but i didn't because it compressed my rib cage made my back ache . not pleasant experience . you need medela nursing bra , but i love their bras too	1
i'm not big fan giving pharmeceuticals infants , but this line somewhat ' natural ' or homeopathic you get commercial stores . i used gas drops religously both my kids it really helped what i call ' colic ' . i also use nose suction fingernail clippers -- theirs best what i could find . i give this warning : if you buying person , make sure you check expiration date . if their baby not due while , you better get one later expiration date . this happened me , bru one expiration date two months ahead , so there no way person i bought if could keep it . i felt bad b/c i didn't notice it while i store , new parent , i'm sure it challenge them return it before they needed use it . just warning	1
after doing our pre-baby research , we registered received this set . we started using it no problems , then my daughter started problems gas . naturally , we blamed it bottles . many bottles wasted dollars later , we returned premium nursers never looked back . fact , more i watch other moms other bottles , happier i am . sure , you spend few extra bucks liners . but time energy dishwasher costs you save well worth it . we 4 bottle shells we use 10 nipples . shells rarely get dirty so rarely washed . likewise rings caps . we usually run load nipples dishwasher every day that it . empty liners pop out no mess recyclable boot . when we go out , i pack 1 pre-assembled bottle , extra liner nipple/ring/cap setup . it weighs nothing takes up way less space than multiple bottles . fly i just pop out dirty liner , throw it away , pop new one screw new top . added bonus - i think my husband may actually invented this ingenius use premium nurser . note : this only playtex brand liners , not generics . when my daughter struggling swallowing too much air , my husband figured out we could fill liner desired amount milk , screw nipple , then squeeze all air out liner , collapsing it down until it vacuum-tight only milk it . keeping finger over nipple hole , pop airtight cap . voila - completely air-free meal baby . this really helped cut back her air swallowing . generic liners work fine all other purposes . last but not least , we like so many other parents , felt many brands drowning our daughter milk . playtex slow- flow nipples worked great her . she still using them 4 months	1
buy more stack higher if you need capacity . takes up less counter space this way . sturdy well designed . comes extender feet so you short or tall levels when stacking . easily unstacks ease loading bottle parts .	1
i've using big bundle me my 28 month old since he 16 months , haven't any trouble getting him fit it comfortably . we use all time when we go out , he loves it . it works great jogger stroller	1
i not use these warming food . i try once it just pain . i purchased bowls because they divided stick high chair . so they great , but i would not recommend getting it if you just looking warming dish	1
we received this today when i showed it my 7 month old , it brought huge grin his face squeal delight ! this adorable toy so bright eye catching , delightful vanilla scent . horn noises tentacles make also bring huge smile my sons face fun experiment different tones song producing sounds . i am ordering 2 more baby gifts friend family member !	1
i bought this booster replace our graco turbobooster because i drive jeep cherokee sport w/ very low back bucket seat ( no headrests either ) . i feel my daughter ( 5 yrs . old ) more support because whole back raises height adjustment ( not just headrest ) . i've also heard compass replace our booster seat if we accident . we both very happy .	1
when trying decide what we needed didn't need our daughter , i knew we needed something contain diapers . we no desire trek out trash every change ( especially those first weeks all hours day night ! ) . basically me it came down diaper genie or diaper dekor . i considered price refills , reviews , advice friend who works daycare went diaper dekor . we love it !!! it wonderful job refills lasted longer than i would ever imagined . dekor came one fill- we've not gone through entire box refills yet . our daughter 7 months old now , she eating solids some those diapers pretty nasty . however , quick change drop into dekor no more smell . plus , it just easy toss wipes other related trash items instead wasting refills or tracking it through house . only time we've ever smell -- when we've it open inner doors open put diaper . soon it closes -- no more smell . those who swear their diaper genies -- i don't think it accident recent redesign dg basically resembles dd design function . i personally think we'll get lot more use out dd down line . i highly recommend diaper dekor your nursery !!	1
i used diaper genie my last child it horrid ! this diaper dekor wondeful must product ! i would recomend it every parent looking disposal system . there really no diaper smells , it holds tons diapers easy use . get this my husband changes bag me well using it dispose diapers . i mainly chose it due great reviews , believe them this best system out there . i hear bigger one great too , i bought this smaller model due limited space my house figured it would add nicely my bathroom once baby out diapers	1
this fits all my strollers plus if you live rainy area	-1
this really handy mini electric pump i . i pump straight into bottles . i just use bottle occasionally so this item works great me . nipples fast flow so first time i fed my baby , milk flow too fast . i just picked up geber nuk slow flow nipples it perfect my baby .	-1
our toddler recently moved into " big boy " bed falling out bed numerous times night . we originally bought single bed rail but found we needed double sided bed rail because we can't his bed against wall because he kicks wall wakes us up throughout night . i actually like positioning double rail better than single because it clamps onto bottom mattress rather than top which leave more room bed . it easy change sheets because rails drop down . last part assembling sides fabric ( getting screws correct place ) little difficult , probably easier two people but other than , very easy assemble . we very pleased this purchase	1
not great lay your infant inside , but ok if you leave it closed slide it under baby extra support . you can't let go your baby this way , but it works great when your baby already fallen asleep you need something support their weight . if you carrying your child your hip , you could slip it under their heiny support their weight . it quick fix tired arms but , it doesn't free you up completely	-1
my daughter 3 we working hard potty training ! i got this gift when i pregnant i love it ! there occasional smell i noticed if i let bag fill up too much . but simple just empty it more often . i like refill bags last long time . i admit i sometimes put poopy diapers inside bag before i put it daiper pail ( just make sure it won't smell . 3 threes i it i only brought 5 refill packages comparism diaper genie nothing . refill packages little pricey ( my local toys us sells 9.95 box)but it worth it like i said , they last ! my daughter knows take her pull up off when it bath time she throws it dekor diaper pail without touching anything . i wouldn't want diaper genie where i change something every other day-i dump mine out once week-love it	-1
evenflo whisper connect 900mhz 2-way nursery monitor our second whisper conect monitor . compared already good one way 900mhz model this one even more sensitive , lower noise level , longer lasting rechargeable nimh batteries 2 way mode save you lot walking if your child only needs hear your voice . strong recomendation	1
i'm so happy this item ! even though my son almost three this our first baby monitor . i lot research finally purchased this one because it could used walkie-talkie , rechargeable batteries , large range . we big yard so freedom nice . it works well little feedback .	1
this fleece blanket matches zanzibar set . it really soft great edition this line . i love it	1
these so soft cushy my sweet darling face . they great cold weather too ! i suggest getting them early help head support well but my daughter now 5 months old i just love them comfort warmth	1
i think these awesome ! must newborns ! i just my 5th child wish i found these earlier ! i didn't use this long , first month . but it made things so much easier i think it worth every penny ! one thing i really like you keep top closed holding their arms close while you change their diapers . they seem not mind their diapers changed much this way . they also nice because they stay tightly swaddled unlike recieving blankets loosen move around	1
i * love * this product . it far better velcro swaddler than other brands because it uses bigger patches velcro . comparison blanket , this much easier use provides much more durable swaddles . i'm quite good blanket , but six weeks age , my son could wriggle out . other hand , three months , he never wriggled out cotton flannel swaddleme . however , even cold weather , microfleece too hot . several times i've felt under blanket find my son sweaty . it even worse when we combine swaddle sling . other hand , cotton knit ( solid colors ) blankets too stretchy - my son quickly converts his knit swaddleme into toga , leaving both arms flying free . cotton flannel ( gingham prints ) less stretch than other two fabrics , plenty enough cover keep baby warm indoor temperatures . it trickier find , but worth search . microfleece swaddleme , however , make great non-swaddle blanket cold days , particularly when baby front carrier . velcro quite versatile .	-1
i used this my recent trip alaska new zealand . pack extremely helpful navigating through airport well boarding plane .	1
i purchased these par t-t ime preschool program although they easy use , they not durable i'd like them . however , we continue purchase them because price convenience	-1
our little boy too . he cuddles right up against you falls asleep month old , carrier so comfortable .. we tried several babies us then bought this one . you won't dissappointed	1
this carrier very easy use without additional adult help . straps soft , easy adjust it simple clean ( lots slobber my son chewing flap when forward facing ) . my lower back begins hurt after hour this but i can't imagine any front carrier going feel all good after long . i am not rating this 5 simply because it expensive . i would recommend trying few more inexpensive brands if price issue	-1
i'm very please this product . my son unable re-organize bookshelves , dvd , vhs all other things his not suppose touch .	1
this good choice . only thing it not suitable 2 1/2 yr old kid . they already climb out this gate . but i still like this	-1

i purchased two these gates , one top stairs bottom stairs . it simple adult use , but tricky enough toddler not open it independently . unlike other swing gates , this gate not any parts run floor . i heard complaints adults children tripping over " threshold " some other gates , so i think this better design . nice feature this gate made out wood . my favorite feature price ! i only paid $35 , while many similar gates sell $100 . i cannot give this product 5 stars , because it little difficult install properly . you must precise or latch not line up . once you it place , it wonderful gate	-1
i can't say enough good things this jogger ! it become our " everyday " stroller ! my 18 month old always " arms " baby . i wear him slings , even now 24 pounds . but , he loves this ride ! swivel-wheel front makes it super-easy maneuver , turn , steer . i often see parents older-model bob ( pre-swivel ) they make awkward turns rolling their joggers onto back wheels . what pain ! i'm so glad i got revolution ! ours " mesa orange " color , but i think it reminds me tomato soup , reddish orange , not too bright . it reclines enough my son nap , flap so i look him . only thing i would change basket bottom hard access when my son jogger . also , if there some sort ipod attachment/pocket would huge plus ! ( like jeep stroller ) but , i purchased some folding speakers , used velcro seucure them ( temporarily ) canopy . now we tunes our walks ! i use my console ( purchased seperately ) hold my cell phone , keys , ipod , sippy cup water bottle . love bob !	1
my wife i love our revolution . it so easy lock or unlock front wheel stability or manuverability . it light tough , folds up fairly compactly ease . i haven't tried many other joggers , but couldn't happier bob	1

i'm writing this review tell other potential buyers this " universal " car seat carrier not technically fit baby trend snug ride infant car seat ( great product ) . description listed this web site states it . instead returning it , my crafty husband made few his own alterations keep our baby girl safe . ultimately , i looking universal car seat carrier black and/or gray instead navy blue , this what i found . despite feeling misled , i'm rating this carrier four stars because it serves its purpose very well , especially those who infant seat actually compatible . my only other complaint basket difficult access	-1
i love table toppers . we currently live asia travel all over world . we've used them japan , china usa . food gets spilled off plates , dumped tables plopped little kids mouths . table toppers we know surface they eating off isn't filled germs . my daughters like rip them off table occasionally , but we found trick fasten edge close them over edge table wait put them down until right before food arrives , way they more focused food than placemat	1

i using this pump since my daughter born 7 weeks ago . it very easy comfortable use , works very quickly . i highly reccomend this pump anyone who plans pump regular basis	1
embrace extremely comfortable . my wife loved it when compared friend medela . one complaint though .... it pump little slower then other pumps ..... but extra comfort well worth it ! playtex awesome customer support . my wife accidently tore one her valves ( little white points fit under each cup ) . she called playtex they immediately fed exed her 4 replcement valves free . they only asked we return torn valve(s ) rd . careful valves they bit fragile if you tear one it adversely affects suction cup .	1
i love this pump . i've tried medela hospital grade pumps this far most comfortable pump ever . i'm proud mom almost 5 month old twin girls i used hospital pump which got me bleeding second day . problem , flangies too small me they didn't anything larger . embrace right size me after getting home hospital 3rd day i married my pump 24/7 . we latching problems so i never able fully nurse my babies , but embrace i'm still going strong after 5 months pump 50-60oz/day . i no problems my pump , no motor failures , no tube problems , nothing . i've pumpped it like i said , almost 5 months average 5 times day . it may bit noisy ... my husband calls it respirator :) but i would not switch my pump medela or any other anything . i'm sorry some you bad experience your embrace , not everybody body made same not every manufacturing lot same , i'm sure . this pump life saver me my girls i no plans stopping pumping . i started 4oz bottles came system eventually graduated pumping into dr. brown 8oz bottles . i love fact i pump directly both narrow widemouth bottles . i've never cleaned my pump nor bottles dishwasher , but wash them hand . i started working when my girls 9 weeks old , so i guess i called wahm ( i'm web developer work home ) i didn't notice any drop supply during work day compared weekend . worth every cent ! try , compare ... not every medela user happy their pump either . there no product out there going satisfy everybody . embrace just better	1

we used this play mat before our baby eating solids . he liked looking colorful images it kept his drool off carpet . we moved it under his highchair when he started eating it helps keep baby staining carpet . i wish it bigger though , so it would protect larger area . i wish it thicker . since our dining room carpeted , wheels highchair push mat into carpet stretch it bit . this leaves crescent-shaped bumps or indentations mat . overall it good product , especially price	-1

my only complaint remote loud , so we never use it . music great , although , some music programmed under wrong composer . oh well . i guess babies aren't reading composers ' names anyway	-1
check see if crib or play-yard you intend this actually work it . when mine didn't , i decided attach it ( secure safe ) my headboard . curious reports it not loud enough , i laid down listen . it plenty loud enough , even distance 2.5 feet overhead . remember , your infant hasn't spent time front speakers counting crows concert ! when baby ( 9 weeks old ) finally got shot it , he enchanted , stimulated , very excited . so much soothing -- but it wonderful know while i'm fold laundry he watching bright colors listening lovely music . great addition day baby ..	-1

this sleeper awsome . my daughter 4 weeks old sleeps 7.5 hour stretches it . i pick her up breast feed her put her right back down , i think all lack moving around helps her get right back sleep . she right there me al night sleeps sooo soundly . maybe it " 4th trimester " feeling helps her so calm . whats great she sleeps same way it day time naps without me there bed her . must !	1

this great activity our little girl first few months . pillow really helped her lift her head way up check out world , toys fun manipulate . she still plays crab 8 months . unfortunately , our cat really liked water-filled fish pillow , so he chewed hole it . i figure that my fault not putting toy away night ... our baby still enjoyed toy without water	-1
this only way we could get our newborn tummy time . flat his stomach when he couldn't hardly raise his head all just freaked him out he'd cry cry . but little raised pillow , it would keep him his face smoshed into floor he'd more patient trying look around . now he 4 months able lift his own head fine he doesn't really need extra booster pillow , he didn't start playing water bit until 3 months . plus velcro one toy links wouldn't hold . but little attached toys very nice - we made belt his infant carrier put them there where he plays them all time . but i think it very nice baby they learn head control so it lifts them bit off ground so they don't panic much	-1
i finally got smart 3rd child bought these gates ( 3 them ) instead those kind you push down lock into place they fall over , these gates so secure really tall , my cats hard time jumping over them . my friend this gate also 80 pound dog he hasn't able budge it . we really big doorway our hall living room we able use 2 bigger 10 " extenders it fit perfectly . each gate comes 5 " 10 " extender . i would highly recommend these gates	1

my son , who just turned two , heartily enjoys this toy . only major complaint i it while it compartments both sides " canvas " storing crayons , those compartments not easy me open , much less 2-year old . compartments indentation where one presumably supposed squeeze open chamber , but it doesn't work so well us . this actually become little maddening frustrates my little one . small quibble , but it would great if this toy slightly modified make compartments little easier get	-1

this my second first years warmer my second child . first one got tons use lasted whole first year heating up bottles my son . now child , i decided i splurge new one since bottom starting burn out bit . i highly recommend it . bottles warm minute very easy . it all easy while holding baby one hand too . only negative i see if i've yet master how much water throw . it works putting small amount water right into unit then it heats up essentially steaming bottle so it even warming process . problem most likely me because i never pay attention how much water i'm putting note future if it right or not . but worst case i little more second time , or give minute cool down . usually it perfect . all choices out there , i highly recommend this one .	1
i literally every pad out there imaginable . i gerer pads , medela pads , curity pads hospital pads . none them add up advent ones , i even especially baby pads those actually just good advent pads . what makes them two pads slightly different advent pads come nipple indent . i both pads if your money concious buy especially babies brand . advent pads hold so much fluid , it not even funny . i leak so much all time it doesnt seep through my clothes . all other pads thin me , tape others useless because it doesnt really stick bra	1

this exersaucer many great aspects . there many toys entertainment if your child gets bored toys came system , switch-a-roo bought mix things up . our daughter this since she 3 months old 5 months loves it even more . she loves frog string because she easily " mouth " it . there learning music two three electronic toys volume control all . we use arch solely floor play home away home because they difficult reach when attached exersaucer earlier age . not sure how toddler station entertain yet ; but infant , this toy great . cost expensive , but when you add up variations , it well worth cost . system collapse but still bulky heavy move around . system little time consuming assemble but aren't our little ones worth it ?! same time we bought stationary bouncer because our daughter loved bounce when we held her . however , we found she stays entertained this exersaucer longer seems enjoy it better now . i highly recommend this product child learn entertain themselves ( which builds imagination better attention spans ... gives mom/dad moment clean bottle or two ) great tool interact your child you sit floor ( eye contact communication reinforces learning toys )	1

we purchased this desparation because our son lot colic outbursts we hoped previous reports correct . although it doesn't always work calm him , it helps 2 out 5 times which better than before , he even falls asleep it occasionally - something he only previously our arms . so we it 2 months long i put some white noise , his non-fussy modes , he generally go sleep 1/2 hour ! there 2 things i would change - 1 . straps pain work , newborn they aren't really necessary since he doesn't yet move much . i always put blanket fully reclined seat soften feel straps his back ( i don't use them yet ) . 2 . white pastic bar pain use , it takes lot snap it down unhook it when he crying , so i just took it off ( which took some work after installing it ) . now i grab him easily when he wakes up fussy . all all i am very please it - he loves looking hanging animals over his head sounds work magic .	-1
i am first time mom 6 week old colicy baby who usually up fussy around 10pm 2am . my sister gave us old graco swing saying it would absolute lifesaver . my daughter ended up hating it . i hated it too because it didn't recline enough support her neck , plus it wasn't very sturdy . so i took her babies us , where you try different swings out . luckily she very fussy time , even my arms . she kinda liked nature touch swing but it 40$ more took 4 batteries 100 hours continuous use . then i saw almost all them took 4 batteries 100 hours . then i put her baby einstein swing i am not kidding , she got quiet happy . she loved sound effects flashing lights tray . it also harness seat belt reclined enough so she could fall asleep without her head bobbling around . i also noticed it took only 3 batteries 200 hours continuous use ! there family shopping baby swings time when they saw how happy she got swing they decided buy it too . night she honestly slept around 10pm 2am . i actually got nervous because she sleeping so long woke her up ! oh , i also love how sturdy it it easily folds down store away or move around . it best swing babies us . or least my baby thinks so	1
this gift not myself . i understand receiver really likes i t.t hanks	1
we originally going get our 8 month old jumper you hang door . after reading some reviews injuries mishaps jumping into door frames , we firmly decided against researched floor models . we this jumperoo one 4 support poles base . square jumperoo didn't nearly many toys her discover it seemed take up much more space . we decided this jumperoo because it took up less room more toys only slightly more money . investment worth it just first 10 minutes fun ! when we first put her , she wasn't quite sure what make it just looked around toys grabbing them . after she realized ( first 2 minutes ) she could jump , she great joy . her face all smiles watching her kick her feet out while jumping us all rolling floor hysterically . toys she likes best ones spin she reaches parrot frog hang . tiger comes up when you push button seems pretty useless , color wheel . whole thing took us 10 minutes put together few minutes wash toys . remember not submerge electronic one put 3 aa batteries it . box not include batteries you'll need screwdriver remove battery cover . also , large spinning ball rainbow sticker sides if you don't dry right away , well , they'll start wrinkle . jumperoo fold up easier carrying/stowing but it not smooth transition . i don't see us doing it often however . i mentioned , entertainment adults got well worth cost initially . now , our baby girl great time bouncing it while strengthening her legs . she doesn't seem like jumping without audience but maybe she when she gets little older . don't wait get this , you won't regret it !	1
i large breasts - dd normally without added bonus milk . my son latched great first , but then got cold could not latch properly . he got lazy my milk supply very good refused open his mouth wide enough . needless say breastfeeding became torture . i almost point considering formula when i came across these . within just few hours wearing them , pain decreased . shells helped shape my nipples little better made it easier my son latch little effort . after full day use , pain become almost non-existant . i wish i bought these my daughter because i might able breastfeed her longer than just 9 months . these shells made breastfeeding wondeful bonding experience it meant . my son still little lazy latch , but he getting better opening his mouth wider now . first i discouraged thought needing sanitize them every night , but i bought microwave bottle sanitizer which makes sanitizing them breeze . i am very satisfied customer	1
when my parents bought base off our registry , they didn't understand why we'd need two bases one car seat . " can't you just move yours cars ? it not like you'll riding our car often " after we strapped second base into their car , they hardly ever removed it they relished opportunities pick up baby spur momen t.t hey disappointed when baby outgrew his snugride seat hoped i could find similar base system next size car seat . after watching me move his convertible seat back forth few times , they've decided install second larger seat their car avoid hassle . snugrider far more cost space-effective solution than 2 car seats , since base only installed once , people less familiar car seat still safely move baby out car repeatedly greatly lessened risk error	1
any diaper system stink if you don't empty it . this one works great . if you worried smell , you're probably not cleaning it out timely manner . who wants keep dirty diapers their baby room two days ?	1

this seat worked brilliantly over past few months . it seems very comfortable my daughter who used it since she 6 months old . she now 13 months old just over 20 lbs no problems it . i elongated toilet it doesn't fit perfectly my daughter sometimes tempted put her hands through gap - especially drop things (!!) but this hasn't really bothered me much . we even travel it it so ligh	-1
simple elegant design . i've never met babybjorn product i didn't love . easy use , easy clean , kids gain confidence real potty you're not wiping poop out " bucket " . it worth extra costs , it worth shipping costs if you can't find it near you	1

this gate actually changed our life , our 18 month old crazy kitchen we spent lot time next him so he would not hurt himself there . nothing could keep him away kitchen . after we bought this gate we let him run around house without afraid he would go there . this gate very easy install , operate it cost cheaper than others . i would recomend this all small kids	1
i never write reviews ( but often read them ) , however this product well worth time ( which highly coveted these days my 3 week old ) . this swaddle very easy use actually stays put . i wish they this when my four year old infant ... i love it !	1
i looking sling but didn't think i could use kind rings . i wanted something sturdy when i shopping online , i saw this one . i love this !! my daughter gets nice snug inside most people not even know i am carrying her . definately worth purchase	1
great deal price , pack 2 seat protector . it just what it claims , protect back front seat little kid shoes marks . even if description says " deluxe " , it not quite , plastic edge ( sewed lining ) easily tore apart if pulled too hard	-1
got this stroller pretty quickly seller back december . very nice , quite solid . our daughter loves it . it clearly example " you get what you pay " . my only complaint . i wish basket underneath could little deeper . but overall , excellent stroller	1
we originally purchased this chair 7 years ago , same design different colors then . after two more babies we thought get new portable chair travel , new ones come so much more , or so i thought . i bought one removable tray thinking would nice and-no way . soon our daughter figured out she could fling tray off it waste space made bigger mess !!! ( now she throw all food once ! ) i miss our simple back-to-basics chair like this one . also careful most other chairs not height adjustable this model . this great economical reliable choice	1
my little musicians give these instuments good workout they still great shape . they really enjoy them love their own instruments play . i highly recommend them child who enjoys music	1
we three children , ages 2 mos 3 years , we use this stroller all three . seats fold down flat enough , use seat belt head support , our infant just fine it . our 2 year 3 year old love it because they sit side side talk , share snacks , etc . only problem we it , 18 mos worth serious wear tear ( i.e. dozen plane trips , two vacations , weekly use zoo ) , clip holds it together when folded gotten warped so sometimes pops off . cure ? we wrap luggage strap around it when flying- rest time it no big deal . we actually double jogging stroller ( which cost 3x much ) , while we loved it 2 mos ) , we haven't used since our second child 3 mos old . it big bulky , it much more difficult maneuver . jeep double umbrella stroller great	1
i bought this sleep sheep my son who 20-months time . he transitioning into big-boy bed . he loved bed , but wanted me stay him until he fell asleep . i bought this sheep hopes source comfort him , replace me ! it worked ! he loves it . only downside there only 2 sound settings he likes . heartbeart whale sounds little creepy . i would've liked few more options like birds or babbling brook . but we love rain ocean settings available . i say " we " because i find it very soothing too	-1
i skip hop dash black canvas absolutely love it . so , this just little added bonus get bag . it holds 2 size 2 gerber nuk pacifiers its snap strap attached just anything . we attach it our stroller so we clean pacifiers hand all times	-1
my newborn son would not take pacifier first three weeks his life . we tried many different brands ( advent , mam , etc . ) but unlike his older sister who took advent brand her second day her life , he not like it all . shape pacifier seems more natural breastfeed baby . i would strongly recommend this pacifier all mothers breastfeeding . we so thankful we found this pacifier , especially 2 morning !	-1
everyone tries tell you any breastpump any less than hospital grade not work if you going back work full time . but i found this one worked just fine , i could pump 15 minutes twice day , it worked great . i ended up not breastfeeding long i thought , i am very glad i didn't spend $200-$300 breastpump . this one still works great , i plan use it my next child . not everyone needs hospital grade pump , don't let people convince you . i gave it 4 because it little loud , but not too bad	-1
i've searching stroller met all my needs this it . i twins 10 months old i used 4 different strollers since they born . none them everything i needed until now . i needed something every day could fit my van i could also take beach . this stroller fits small space ( 19 " deep ) back my van without remove wheeles . it opens closes so quickly easily . you just unfold it it locks into place . closing just easy one hand . seats recline separately , front wheele swivle wonderful . i easily push this stroller one hand . i able get through all doors , but i say there couple places tight squeeze . there good basket under stroller but there bar above it so you can't put anything too big . i love it seat cushions you remove wash . it foot brake but no hand break so i'm not sure if this would good stroller serious joggers . it great find something make my life little easier	1
my kids love cooshie booster . its stays secure without straps nice soft their little fannies . booster easy clean " stainless " . i highly recommend cooshie booster . we've one over 4 years now bought our second when our second daughter ready approximately 2 years ago . both still perfect condition	1

we originally wanted stroller/car seat combo , but we received this shower gift . we love it ! our infant graco snug ride carseat actually fits into stroller ( facing whomever pushing ) . my husband loves ipod connection , it works well best i tell . tires easy inflate , i able figure out air pump inflate tires out any instructions . i also find it lot storage capacity shopping . it not super easy steer one hand i sometimes when my baby wants out . stroller heavy lift out trunk it not fit all cars . it awkward lift stowe ( watch your fingers ) it takes up lot space . it collapse using one hand , but its not if you could it while holding your baby or anything else so it might well two handed ) also , i find it not best steering small isles stores , it tends get hung up . however , it ride over most terrain quietly little disturbance your little one . it two cup holders near handle , but i find they usually too small . i read once they designed fit starbucks cup -- my avent bottles not fit well nor bottles water . overall , i would recommend this stroller , its well priced , durable functional .	-1
my son one those climbers so i buy this when he 18 months . he able climb out but couple falls made me nervous . we it awhile now i absolutely love it . i am also happy it next child so i don't worry my son throwing things into crib . i recommend it all parents . it easy assemble . i one my mom house home . first my son little uneasy it but i zipped it up while he sleeping each night until he just got used it . now he asks me it .	1

i two these dishwasher baskets , but i not valve basket . they purchased separately some stores . i originally bought type dishwasher basket bottle nipple compartment top , but it much more difficult use . everytime you opened it add nipple , ones already there would fall out . these dishwasher baskets designed allot better . they nipple compartment bottom better cleaning slots bottle nipples fit into . best aspect , however , nipples not fall out when compartment opened	1
this gives 100% coverage - even covers all big costco cart . there loops holding toys little side pocket extras . my son loves ride cart chew things - this i don't worry he going chew cart . it also extremely easy put take off - i usually it one handed while holding my son . must !	1
these great if you're looking into buying cloth diapers , very soft cushy	1
i read other reviews thought i should order lg/xl . well , i guess i really didn't need size , med would worked also . it gave me great support eased low back pain . i think it works excellent	1
bought this my 2 year old grandaughter . she tiny afraid bigger bed , so this perfect her . she loves bed sleeps very well it	1
super cute bed , but my husband i hard time putting it together . my daughter liked it 3 months now twin bed ... it great her baby dolls	-1
those looking inexpensive alternative $45 wooden stools should consider this . my two year old carry without risk pinching fingers well	1
my baby mostly breastfed , but dad gives baby bottle night so i get few hours uninterupted sleep . baby loves this bottle it really keep air bubbles out milk . only downfall all parts putting them together . if i it over , i would tried playtex premium bottles drop ins	-1
i really like pattern this changing pad . it matchs up my diaper bag ; this only reason i bought it . i wish my diaper bag comes this changing pad so i don't spend extra money buy it . really i don't care pocket .	-1
when i began my research potty chair my son , i no idea how many things there consider ! i really didn't want anything made noise or lights but we ultimately decided this chair because one-piece splash guard since i learned it wasn't uncommon little boys hurt their tender bits other chairs . it well-made sturdy ; it didn't tip when my son got or off . i think main thing it give my son confidence use potty - his feet stayed securely ground it stable didn't slip around . he no problem getting himself off it he liked ' responsibility ' dumping contents into big potty ( i liked it easy him , easy me clean bowl afterward )	-1
these great diaper covers . they seemed huge first until i got hang them . they clean easily dry fast , no special washing required ! i think elastic feels rough , but my little one doesn't seem mind there no marks her legs them . these great diapers all kinds cloth , prefolded fitted diapers	-1
like most reviewers , i too like this bather . it much softer than plastic tubs folds fairly easy storage ( least it smaller store than plastic ones . ) however , my son little jaw chatters because he gets chilly because he so far out water . i fill my tub up high water , but angle chair doesn't allow him enough his body safely submerged . i think it would great warmer weather , but january february midwest cold . i also wish manufacturer would make washer bold underside plastic piece . it rusted my model too	-1
i given hand-me-down changing pad i used my 1st 2nd child but it really looking bad when baby #3 came , so i broke down bought this . i love it ! my covers fit snug but easily strap so nice hold baby few seconds while i grab something instead making one my other children stand beside baby keep her rolling ! my child also loves play strap it keeps her occupied during changes	1

i bought this border accessorize my froggy tales collection . it matches beautifully set . it little tricky hang . i found just adding water prepasted back not quite enough make it stick well . i added wallpaper paste it assure it adherance . i also liked it double roll covers 30 feet rather than standard 15 most wallpaper borders . it makes my froggy tales set complete	-1
my daughter just turned 1 year old . she tiny side so i concerned what type carseat i going purchase . i read many reviews britax it seemed like company go . i loved print this my daughter looks so cute it . not mention she finds it much easier fall asleep this seat than her infant carrier . my husband said it fairly easy install i know getting her out well adjusting straps breeze . it perfect buy i would recommendend anyone	1
i love this car seat , but more importantly , my 7-month old baby girl seems love it too . we switched her this seat when she 6 months old , car rides whole lot better . she plenty room it reclines better than her infant car seat ( graco snugride ) , it well padded . we call it princess ' throne . my husband shocked first how much this thing costs , but now he understands why . this so easy install very safe . i love latch system -- thing barely moves . you can't put price safety . plus this grow her until maybe she 5 . also , you cannot go wrong this beautiful fabric . i love it -- not pink , but very girlie sweet . i love it ! well worth $$	1
i just love this high chair so my 7 month old . it puts him right up table rest family . it easy attach table easy dettach it store . its easy fold up take it you .	1
this item works wonderful very easy clean . cover slips off thrown washer . i prefer this type high chair over larger free-standing ones . very convenient taken anywhere	1
shortly after i found out i pregnant our 2nd child , i bought swaddleme whim . i knew benefits swaddling newborn so our 1st child , swaddleme caught my attention its design overall ease properly swaddling baby . time , i didn't know exactly how handy this little blanket/wrap would . our baby now 2� weeks old this product become one most important baby items we own . our daughter fussy just couldn't seem settle down ... until i pulled out swaddleme wrapped her up it . instant change her personality unreal . she now happy content baby fussy crying all but stopped . only time she doesn't " wear " her swaddleme during diaper clothing changes her carseat - any other time day , she snuggly wrapped up . swaddling baby regular blanket bit tricky , but this specially-shaped wrap makes it super easy . velcro tabs ensure baby can't accidentally loosen wrap unswaddle him or herself . i highly recommend this wonderful blanket/wrap anyone who expecting or newborn baby	1
i purchased mini co-sleeper my first child . she slept it our bedside until she 6 months old . i really feel her beside me helped us all sleep better . if she woke up fussing , i could just reach over pat her , find her pacifier , etc . without get out bed walk nursery every time . often i could comfort her before she really got good awake/upset i could get her back sleep faster . 6months , she getting too large it , so i transitioned her her own crib nursery no problem . only drawback it not very easy fold up travel-i get my husband it me every time . but , i yet find portable crib very easy fold up ( we pack play too ) . when you get it folded up put into its carrying case , it doesn't take up much room . used co-sleeper parent bed or free-standing bassinet . overall , i pleased use it again my next baby	-1
so when my son got toddler stage , i worried how keep him warm his stroller . we live city , so travel stroller way life . he loves outside , but really dislikes covered up - you see source needing this product ! overall , we found this product very good - it machine washable , it warm my son ( 16 months time purchase ) , there room him grow into it bit this winter , it fits our maclaren quest stroller nicely , it attractive . only downsides we noted we wish it one zipper up middle , instead zipper up each side . reason this we think it would tougher our son get his hands out bag this way - he nothing short houdini-like , however , his ability get himself out outwear protective items like this bag , so it may not matter all . other thing not attach stroller securely we would like - it tendency slide down front , eventually , usually rainy day , bottom bag drags ground bit . however , going back fact it washable , this not huge complaint either . this may also function stroller which you trying use this . i would recommend this product anyone squirmy toddler who loves outside much my son	-1
my only complaint this potty topper concerns stick-in-place double sided tape . peel-off backing difficult remove tape out tearing potty topper . it takes bit time get off , if you toddler dancing around bathroom stall , doing pee-pee dance , you don't luxury lot time . also , when ' deed ' , it time remove potty seat cover , you again need very careful , or tape tear off cover , remain toilet seat . then you pick it off your fingernail - yuck ! i think ' post-it note ' kind stick-in-place would much better than double sided tape . seat cover doesn't need stick seat forever , just long enough my toddler tinkle . other than , this great . after my toddler finished , i used it too , found it very comfy . it cushiony , provided warm layer over cold toilet seat . i didn't worry anything leaking through , it seems water-proof . it large enough cover enitre seat , even those large public toilet seats . i continue use these , they provide layer protection i am looking , but i need extra careful tape , until something better comes market	-1
we bought this just travel purposes . couple years we've traveled extensively our big bulky stroller while great holding carry-ons , it pain move around . so this one fine what we use it : quick trips park , moving our two year old around airport toss back car just case we need it mall . it rough ride kind squashes him sides ( he now 31 pounds ) but like i said , it not our main stroller . i'm 5'5 " i find handles awkward height but my 5'11 " husband thinks it fine . we live ca so able fold up back little air circulation handy but not used so often . i would definitely recommend this if you need save money or need good quality cheap stroller	1
i already bought noah ark design this type display ; we keep it living room ( i reviewed display more detail ) . we purchased this one our son bedroom . i wish canvas came more colors than just red , but natural wood beautiful . it very easy put together - only took couple minutes . it sturdy , but light-weight . it holds all sizes books , hold anywhere 12 36 books depending their size shape . 1st guidecraft book display help us teach our son respect his books . he took such good care them ( like putting them back display instead throwing them floor ) , we able introduce paperbooks our 18 month-old , he doesn't try tear them apart . i think this type book display more practical children books than traditional bookshelf , due shapes sizes	1
few days after i got home hospital i thinking stopping breasfeed because my nipples so sore such pain ( even though baby latched just fine ) . these pads worked miracles ! put them refrigerator apply them your nipples right after feeding . you feel great ! these truly saved me . now baby 6 months old still breasfeeding ... i'm sooooo glad i not stop .... thanks these pads ( chamomile tea applications ) . they might bit pricey but very worth it !	1
what else i say ? fits my bugaboo perfectly never fails me	1
i got this pump hospital it work great me . i pump more milk this one than my electric pump . i used this one instead than my electric pump when watching tv . manual pump so you get work out using it . if you afford electric medela pump thats great , but if you don't need pump often this works great . very easy take you help times you engorge baby can't latch drink	1
i love this item baby only going take occasional bottle so mommy daddy date , etc . i use mine little differently . i put liner ( i use cheaper soft bags ) directly into bottle . then i screw collar pump adaptor . i pump directly into bottle then screw off adaptor screw lid ( nipple ring plug it ) . then when baby sitter goes feed baby , she not take off collar risk loosing bag milk . she just screws off top lid screws nipple ( using contrasting color nipple ring plug lid may help distinguish which part should unscrewed ) . ( this also solves problem milk raised above readings bottle . ) only thing i don't understand why they don't give you more plugs go lids . you wouldn't need lids if they would just give you plugs , you could put them rings go your bottles .... i know this confusing ; you kind need looking pieces understand what i'm talking . occasional bottling , 1 newborn gift set 1 breastmilk storage kit more than enough what i need . my babies definately take nurser nipple easier , so how i ended up this system . everything washes dishwasher , so clean up easy	1
i bought this product thinking it would work well other playtex bottles , nipples , etc . i already . it seems working out great . i pump using my medela pump right into storage receptacles then put them right into fridge . if i'm run one afternoon , i grab one go . it so easy even cleaning easy . only couple things wash you're . means lot me when you're constantly cleaning other things around house . i'm one very happy customer	1
this seat wonderful transition our daughter roundabout . reasons why i could not give it 5 stars following : poorly designed cup holders ; early tear fabric ; no secure anchoring . cup holders : we've already spilled juice that left cup holders . they completely useless should better designed . fabric : though material looks resilient , tear developed near lower left corner where her leg sits ... i am assuming this because chair mounted behind driver seat , therefore it gets lot traffic our daughter boards disembarks car - nonetheless , we expected something little more durable . anchors : seat wobbles around doesn't really hold our daughter place . she often reaching over pick something up , seat nearly topples over . i am not sure why this wasn't considered design . it makes it easy remove install , but i'd rather something little more stable	-1
i tried few boosters before settling britax parkway . first we tried jupiter booster . my daughter tiny girl ( 5yrs . old- 36 lbs . 43 inches tall ) . she way too tiny jupiter . shoulder belt kept sliding off her shoulder her head wasn't supported when she slept car . thing i didn't like jupiter padding under her bottom felt too thin she complained her bottom hurt after long car rides . then we tried graco . it good seat . but no head support unless you lay seat back ways . i didn't like plastic seat belt guides because it hurt my daughter cheek sleeping it . next we tried parkway ( britax ) . this booster far best booster market my opinion . i am huge britax fan . all my kids britax babies . my 3 year old 4 month old currently sit marathon ( britax ) . this booster enough padding keep kids comfortable , head rests keep their heads flopping . my daughter likes way fabric feels ( she very sensitive ) . even though graco booster seat looks like parkway , graco $50 less than parkway , i still didn't like fact red seat belt guides ( graco ) looked like they would hurt rest my head . britax thought everything this seat . i highly recommend this seat . fork over extra cash splurge your child safety !! you'll glad you	1
i shopped months find 3 1 good quality but wasnt pricey . we just moved our 7 month old son our bed this crib . he transitioned nicely . it arrived 1 day later than projected . it fairly easy put it together ( i it myself , my hubby mechanically challenged ) . i break plastic piece i assembled it . company sent replacement , free charge . i received replacement 4 days . only thing i could complain latching system , it works fine , but i feel they could better design	-1
when my baby 2wks old she developed excessive gas very cranky , she would not allow me put her down all . i bought 2oz dr. brown bottle fed her night . she not suffered excessive gas since much happier baby . i truly recommend dr brown bottles	1
our baby some problems gas when she very small , even though she nursing . when she took bottle , we started using these we notice difference . i imagine they're not quite convenient when mixing formula , since it says all over instructions not shake liquid bottles	-1
both my babies slept through after three weeks , i found myself sitting next them half night checking their breathing . so i got angelcare , only checked one night , found it worked ( it easily tested taking baby out , alarm goes off after 10 secs ) , peaceful nights ever after . happy recommend it everybody !!!	1
how many times night you go into your baby room make sure covers still them ? yeah , well , you stop doing now . just buy this . sack zips opposite direction so not catch baby skin . i must washed this thing trillion times it held up wonderfully . just put your baby his/her pajamas zip them up halo sleep sack . it doesn't look like much but it certainly keeps them warm ! i must pointed laughed my daughter good five minutes when i put her this first time . it looks pretty comical , but cute way . she also plenty room move her legs feet around . . . kind like mini sleeping bag stays put . i highly recommend this it makes excellent baby shower gift	1
we bought one these try out b/c our baby would kick covers off middle night we love house cold .. i worried b/c when i went check baby , he always freezing cold . so i went babies us found this ... you can't beat it .... everyone needs least 2 or 3 these little outfits ... we even bought it big so he wouldn't outgrow it ..!!! so i encourage you get least one ..	1

every since i found out i pregnant , i've dreading purchase diaper bag . according my friends , i carry ridiculously small purse mom ( i 12 y.o. already)--it really just cell phone holder one pocket slots cards zippered pocket cash . i knew those days over once my new baby arrives -- after all her big sis 3 before i stepped out house without huge diaper bag . but , same time , if my memory serves me well , bulky bag made hauling around baby her other gear , etc . daily basis even harder . so i thrilled when i saw this bag . it came mail today ( merchant ) like poster , i've trying it out . it fit decent amount gear i expect carry it -- few diapers , change baby clothing , etc . so far , it feels very comfortable . even when worn tandem premaxx new edition baby carrier i also bought . i post again once baby arrives give update this product	-1

when my daughter born i planned strictly breasfeed her first month least . however , complications jaudice forced us introduce bottle her 5th day life . avent system newborn nipple allowed us provide her both expressed breastmilk formula supplements ease . since then i've tried other bottles amp ; nipples . nothing compares gentle flow avent nipple which feeds her just right pace avoid gas spitting up later . we now use nothing but	1

we really like potty trainer but rubber feet inserts missin	-1
these fit all baby bottles not wide-neck , so i bought couple packs extra lids breast milk storage , formula mixing , travel . these work so much better than two-piece lids prevent leaks . my medela bottle lids cracked , so i used these replacement . none these sturdy lids cracked	1
this game extremely fun . i played it multiple groups different people game requested every time . fact , worst thing this game it addictive ! people who wanting head home party early find themselves staying " just one more round " over over . i also played non-electronic catch phrase it fun well . it also cheaper . either way , this game rocks . it same lines taboo , just more fun . i highly recommend this game	1
this product really wonderful when traveling airplane . it just hooks your carry luggage wheels child sits right it you stroll through airport . so many people made comments it i walked through airports while traveling . they thought it neatest thing . i 6 months pregnant when i first used it it great not lug big stroller around i less things take me . i gave it 4 stars only because it take short time hook/unhook it every time you get or off plane . i pull side keep my daughter me while i hooked seat back luggage . but other then it one piece nylon not huge stroller i take anyday	-1
we one eddie bower seat this britax roundabout . it well worth extra cost roundabout . we knew britax car seats got great ratings , but we wish someone told us how much better they than other seats . it huge difference . we're considering throwing out other car seat getting second roundabout . bottom line : it easy use super comfortable our son .	1
i bought this car seat my daughter when she 4 months old . she now 2 years old it still perfect condition . straps never get tangled . it also so easy adjust straps . everything this car seat amazing . my mother law cosco i hate it . spend extra money it worth it .	1
i found this car seat much easier use instal than other car seats we used ( cosco alpha omega elite convertable . my daughter large her age it nice we able keep her seat rear facing position until she one year old . if you big baby ( over 9lb birth ) this your seat .	1
since our bedrooms upstairs it really convenient this product right same room . there no need go downstairs leave baby crying until you get her bottle ready . it takes some time using it get used right temperature since amount water it states use order heat up bottle sometimes not warm bottle enough or sometimes heats it up too much . i don't go amount water stated use each bottle size . regardless size bottle or amount milk it past 4 ozs , i fill vial water up 9-10 push button . time time i take bottle out check temp . once it way i want it , i just take it out , shake it , feed baby , letting rest water evaporate its own . this way i know i always warm bottle since once it turned shuts off , you wait 10 minutes warm it up again . who time patience crying baby tend ? overall , it great idea saved me many trips kitchen	1
we call him seizure dog because color scheme , frankly , almost nauseating grown-up eyes . but babies react this little guy like no other toy i've seen . it really first thing my daughter ever responded outside food people . she used fall asleep holding some part seizure dog anatomy would wake up playing one various dangly bits . high-contrast bright primary color scheme really draws infants ' eyes , especially generally ( appropriately ! ) sedate relaxing nurseries . we now buy seizure dogs all our friends babies . next one we get 6th one these we've purchased , so i'd say we highly recommend it	1
my 4 month old daughter loves this toy . bright colors textures great . pupsqueak keeps her busy . one best toys we purchased	1
i used these bottles supplement nursing last eight months . since liners steralized , all i wash nipples other parts very hot water let dry . these convenient easy use . try rubber nipples well bottle series solid color tops close down nipple - i like those best because they so compact .	1
while we preparing arrival our daughter , we hoping use these bottles because convenience , so when our pediatrician recommended them , decision made . these bottles wonderful !!! they don't scrubbed inside brush like one-piece bottles . we just throw them dishwasher they're . our daughter reflux , silicone slow-flow natural latch nipples work well her . our doctor ( other doctors same group ) says these best bottles cut down gas . i would highly recommend buying premium nursers ( featured here ) instead older original nursers slowly phased out . ( we some each . ) premium lids major improvement-they're easy pop off one-handed , unlike original lids you pry off your fingernails . you interchange all parts both systems ( use any holder any ring any nipple any lid ) , but i think premiums much better . also , premiums come silicone nipples , but originals usually don't . liners these nursers very inexpensive , especially if you use coupons come bottles or if you buy store brand liners ( they work just well ) . only downside this system there isn't much room top liner put full 4 ounces water plus powdered formula shake . but problem happen any bottle , i don't think it big deal . good news those who use these bottles ! i just discovered today you buy extra rings lids www.teebop.com . ( i got info . playtex over phone . ) i plan get some extra premium lids take place few original nurser system lids i ( make up ones i inevitably lose way ) .	1
this little gym kept my daughter busy exploring , touching , feeling , hearing new sounds . i would highly reccomend , fact i bought it all my friens who expecting	1

giving this only five stars insult !! it just not enough ! thank god secure-me travel seat !! my life forever changed !!! first all it takes only 5 seconds set this up shopping cart . i my " squirmy " 9 month old baby one arm my huge diaper bag other thought myself " how world am going this " ? but , low behold 5 seconds later it , she we ready stroll aisles . this far best $14.99 i ever spent my life ! if you even think buying brand you just crazy !!	1
this must moms who like keep their kids secure shopping cart , well clean yucky germs . my son small his age regular strap shopping cart doesn't fit around him corrrectly ... he 2 we still use it . i tried big cart cover covers entire seat he just swam it ... this keeps him secure safe . well away form germy , yucky cart handle . i also like this fits my diaper bag better than big full cover cart cover . must far !!!	1
easy install covers outlet entirely . other safety faceplates i tried never covered outlet completely my son could stick straightened paper clip through . not this one ! they very easy use adult well . :	1
i debating this avent pump since i nothing but avent bottles . end , babies us sold out avent i bought medela backpack adaptor set so you pump straight into avent bottles ( avent doesn't advertise this well ) . i'm so glad i . avent doesn't battery pack so i don't know how you'd use it trip unless you don't mind standing middle airport bathroom pumping . i , myself , prefer privacy stall . also , no one tell its breast pump . backpack very stylish i able fit additional items it so i could use it my only carry-on . design very innovative which you learn more you use . most importantly , i get 5 oz per breast out less than 10 minutes so you don't feel like you're waiting forever while pumping . i'd recommend this anybody	1
i read re-read reviews bottles found only way really find right bottle try them out ( no wonder this multi-billion dollar industry ) . we tried playtex drop-ins frustrated 6 weeks feedings taking hour slow nipples . fast nipples drenched our son formula . we moved avent stage 2 nipple found ourselves 50% people who can't get them shut properly . loved nipple shape speed , couldn't deal leaking . we tried playtex ventaire . although this bottle claims not let air through nipple , we apparently couldn't get these closed correctly either . air entered through nipple every feeding caused gas spit-up problems . we eventually made our way back drop-ins , our son now old enough handle fast nipple , we like these best . i still feel reviews beneficial , but know your kid let you know if he or she needs change . find what works you go it . i give drop-ins 4 stars . if playtex would put out medium flow nipple , it would 5	-1
i bought these bottles when i knew my son would away me need get breast milk bottle . he no problems going my nipple these i liked you could get all air out bottle . now my son formula i find it difficult prepare it these bottles . it almost easier put it seperate cup mix water formula . it it bottle but it little difficult mix it well . i now mastered how put formula how long shake it but it took some practice get it right without formula clumping lot . warming bottles also problem since you cannot microwave liners ( or so it says ) my mother it once without realizing you aren't supposed nothing bad happened but since it advises against it , i wouldn't recommended trying it out . now my son doesn't really care warm milk it isn't issue anymore anyway . i still love these bottles fact if i enough nipples change out , i don't worry " clean " bottle hand since i just drop new liner . i currently 6 extra nipples case this happens but it hasn't yet but it nice know option there us .	-1
i love these bottles so my son . they really keep gas out . nipple great when you also breastfeeding , my son didnt seem notice difference . only problem though , measuring ... i'm fine now my son drinks regular milk , but when i mix formula it hard . you actually only mix 6 oz . formula 8 oz . bottles . what i ended up doing towards end when my son beginning drink 8 oz ., mix formula container or bottle then transfer it playtex . other than its great not wash bottles over over	-1
i not heard this product/brand until my 5th baby born . we doing " elimination communication " him this potty works well his first potty . currently ( he almost 4 o.o ld ) we set potty changing table hold him . safety reasons , we never let go him while sitting there . when he sit up his own , we sit potty floor . eventually he out grow it . we also purchased babybjorn potty trainer , eventually he'll use next . meantime next older child able use it . i like this potty all 1 piece . so easy clean ( no crevises worry ) . we dump contents into toilet . add little water , potty , sink ( potty easily fits into our bathroom sink catch rinse water ) dump rinse water into toilet . size nice storing ... it won't take up lot room . size nice because ( eventually when he older ) he'll able get off it easily himself . i would prefered this item white instead blue ... but time ordering color blue best option ( after additional item purchased my order , i also able qualify free shipping through amazon ) . colors available would not fault manufacturer but who i purchased it . i unable find this any stores my local area . we would drive 50 minutes or more away our home purchase it certain baby store . then we would also paid sales tax our costs drive there . i pleased this purchase through amazon	1
babybjorn it again . small portable , easy clean . great take when you leave house , so your child doesn't sit not so clean public toilet seat ..	1
i bought this booster seat after considering other seats cosco britax . this one stood out value , simplicity , safety , convenience . first , i considerd convertible booster seat also latch system 5 point seatbelts , but decided against it because my son his age weight ( 3.3 yrs , 35 lbs ) not need all these extra features extra bulky be-all car seat . latch 5 point features intended more recent 3 year old , while toddler 3.5 years 10 won't need it , so why bother all this extra stuff ? you don't need added bulk complexity features only used . 5 more years . b510 premier top line latest compass , which more durable fabric , wider side supports , carry bag . my son loved it first sight , it works great . there no neck support though , so you may need buy one these separately long road trips . my son literally propping his head up his arm arm rest when he passed out car . price b510 $[ ... ] free shipping , given free carry bag which retail value $[ ... ] , it makes this booster seat $[ ... ] , which price older b500 model . only thing i get over booster seats general not secured onto car seat latch , but instead , rely seat belt keep my son seat place . when driving around without kids , seats like this need secured even if child not sitting it . base this seat doesn't look like it'll rip into my car leather seat , headrest adjusts vertically easily . i need buy seat protector anyway though , since my son uses car seat step stool get into this booster seat . also , you need train your kids when they unbuckle seat belt because it easily reachable . only shocking thing me this seat comes expiration date , not recommended use after 7 years date manufacture . therefore , it not meant kept forever used hand me down siblings	1
these so awesome ! i never concern my son cold or get strangled blankets . one night i sleep sak laundry it cool night , so i put blanket over him - well my husband checked him middle night found blanket wrapped so tightly around his neck he could hardly believe our son still breathing . very scary . so if anything , make sure you more than one sleep sak .	1
i wondering same thing this stroller - i.e. how it convert " stand " mode ? etc . i seen version this stroller one step ahead website , so i called baby trend they told me it exact same stroller . it just marketed differently different vendors ... they different colors . so , you go one step ahead website get more views stroller . i still not purchased it yet , worried quality overall length stroller . but it seem one lightest double strollers available . good luck	-1
i 23 month old 6 week old initially thought joovy caboose would stroller us . thank goodness we opportunity try one out before we bought it ! joovy , if you infant carrier front seat , there no room all older child sit jump seat . also , some strange reason , jump seat slides back forth which seems very unsafe . so if you infant carrier your older child wants sit , older child out luck . what point ? this stroller , older child 3 options - sit back seat , sit jump seat or stand platform . back seat removed fairly easily stored basket underneath my little girl ( who tall her age ) plenty room . she sometimes dangles her feet over foot rest but this not issue . our infant carrier easily slides into front seat secured belt . this stroller opens closes easily very easy control it steers beautifully - it not nearly long i thought it would but both children plenty room . since it footprint single stroller , it fits through doors entranceways no problem . it little heavy when folded but i don't think i would find stroller these features that not . basket nearly impossible get but i live it . overall , i'm thrilled this purchase every single time i use it , someone stops me ask it . one woman even said , " that most practical double stroller i've ever seen . " i agree	1

this far nicest looking bottle drying rack i could find . i love it . i've never used brush , though , i use different one . others mentioned their brushes breaking , so i'm not sure how it holds up . easy take apart clean when needed	1
although this product isn't perfect , i really couldn't imagine traveling without it . pros : 1 . able hands free ( push stroller , hold child , or other luggage)while seat your back like backpack2 . travel case folds up small nicely - fit under plane seat3 . sturdy ( i didn't any issues rips/tears like some other reviewers)cons : 1 . it bit annoying trying get car seat it , but it fit2 . strap buckle dug into my shoulders ; tried adjust it , but wasn't able make it much better3 . carrier flips occasionally while stroll modeall all , definitely buy this product if you traveling child . i don't know better alternative i can't imagine able carry everything through airport without it !	-1

i am totally satisfied this carseat . it bit tricky getting it installed car ( i recommend reading instructions , extra set hands help you install it ) but all carseats bit tricky . my 7 month old son loves this carseat because it sits higher up than his first seat he see outside ( this makes our road trips much more pleasant ) . there lots places you adjust straps , buckle , headrest so you really make seat fit your baby . i am not sure how well it would work newborn because it doesn't recline far carseats only rear-facing , it might make it harder your little one take naps keep his head comfortable position . ( plus , it so nice carseat detachable base brand new baby so you don't wake them up when they sleeping ) . but if you only want one carseat , i am sure neck support pillow carseat would work great newborns . my favorite feature this carseat i won't keep buying more carseats ( then find place store old ones ) until my son old enough ride without one	1
i shopped around find umbrella stroller wouldn't break my back push i am 5'11 " this stroller perfect . i found it target . it so light folds up easily which i found helpful when traveling going through security airport . i would definitely reccomend this others	1

these shells work really well early breastfeeding occasionally protect sore nipples . they also work increasing milk supply throughout day without added pumping . i use them collect milk opposite side during my nightly feedings , stored up lot milk way . only reason they got 4 stars because they kind hard sometimes feel kind obvious under certain clothing .	-1
i found them very comfotable my sore nipples . they also collect leaking milk ... but don't bend over they spill all over your feet ( my first try ) . other than this wear loose shirt hide them , i use them everyday instead pads get wet irritate my nipples .	-1
i got this gift when my second child born i absolutely lvoe it ! my children year apart both very comfortable it . ride magnigicent ! we hit bump kids don't even notice it . it provides excellent sun protection wonderfully deep canapee . i would recomend this anyone who needs double stroller . then only drawback , it small tht it not portable . it doesn't fit trunk our car . but other then it great stroller !	1
this dish great those parents go need take baby meal them . snap cover good it all dishwasher safe	1
after throwing my first years crib cd player literally trash ( don't get me started what complete hunk junk thing ) , i search replace it . when i came across icrib . you really can't beat price - i'm guessing it reasonable since most controlling ipod itself . granted i only it few days , i cannot rave enough it ! it mounted perfectly crib i think sound fantastic ( i only tried classical not music lyrics so i cannot comment sound quality ) . i inherited my husband older ipod shuffle after i gave him nano x-mas . i searched searched online but could not figure out whether ipod shuffle would work it . muchkin customer service verified it would because it came few adapters accomodate different mp3 players . now , i don't really think they made one specifically fit shuffle , but it fit well enough " small " adapter they included so i happy ( see picture i posted shuffle icrib ) . icrib itself 3 modes - light only ( ipod off ) , light ipod , or just ipod . you also it play 15 , 30 or 60 minutes before it shuts itself off . light actually what i would consider " light show " light slowly changing colors which i think rather calming my baby ( or least it seems ) . only things i would change icrib i would really like it option playing longer than 60 min . i would also happier if it option providing steady , soft light serve constant night light ( no " light show " ) guide me during middle night feedings . otherwise , i am thrilled icrib	1
i received different carrier both me my baby hated it . he couldn't see what going it seemed smother him it hurt my back . i decided purchase moby , i am so happy it . you wear it million different ways ( well , not million , but lot ) it so comfortable . it only took me twice get hang how put it . my son loves it too . my shoulders or back never hurt after carrying him it . i also love book it comes show you different ways which wear it . if you lose it , you go manufacture website , you download print there . i've bought two more my friends since i got mine	1

i purchased this stroller my newborn 2-year-old . i originally planned getting tandem ( fron t-t o-back ) stroller , but when i test-drove it store it felt like huge , long , heavy clumsy tank ( that without kids it ! ) there no way i'd able maneuver tandem stroller busy city streets . then i tried this aria twin side-by-side stroller , it felt so much better then tandem - it so light easy maneuver . so i purchased it , i really like it . it says stroller 6-month-old up , but i successfully use it newborn - seat reclines almost fully , newborn lays it sleeps . this stroller fits through all standard doors most supermarket isles . basket large fits lot stuff . walking city my 2-year-old newborn pretty easy this stroller . only major downside this stroller it doesn't hold car seat .	1
i purchased car adapter 10 hour drive my husband i making our toddler infant . i pump exclusively ( not able breastfeed ) so adapter godsend ! we didn't even pull over . just make sure you well covered don't end up stuck traffic next people who probably wondering what you're up ( unless you're into sort thing )	1
i never so excited new gadget . put it together ten minutes assitance my very excited toddler . i getting very impatient waiting this stroller come market , but couldn't more pleased i . i researched them all going buy it sight unseen , which made me nervous . went local retailer yesterday after instore test drive my almost 3yr old my 3 month old bought it immediately . i can't say enough great things this stroller . especially mom toddler infant . it handles like dream all bells whistles fabulous . folds like piece cake . which i can't say my perego . basket drops down so you access it without changing rear seat position . my 3yr old thinks it coolest thing ever she loves fact her baby sister right behind her . yes it little heavy , but i am small woman manage just fine . after all my oldest weighs 28lbs . it little longer person than photos - ( no big deal ) we all went our first family stroll after dinner last night it amazing . handles fantastically over bumpy sidewalks - no need prop up srtoller get over bump . so sturdy - feel like both my girls snug safe . love five point harness attached seat , unlike perego . really if you children ( particularly baby toddler ) this way go !!	1
i researching strollers months . i also considered combi , aria twin , maclaren . i test drove side side strollers but they couldn't fit through tight store aisles . i liked combi aria width but they awkward steer i didn't care storage any them . i agree above comments but pros outweight cons . it heavy it doesn't fold down compactly i would like but my son absolutely loves climbing front seat . i am 5'2 " i liked handles found it very easy steer . i love storage baskets my infant seat fits great . i am happy metropolitan fabric . it seems like i wipe clean . i fit most my grocerys basket underneath so i don't put both children " germy " shopping cart . cup holders nice too . very easy fold .. easier than my single graco stroller . 4 stars because it heavy bit awkward carry .	-1
my strictly bottle fed 11 month old used these bottles day one fine them . i saved money buying them thrift stores - half them i bought still boxes other half barely used . i ended up switching out older nipple design ( square top ) newer nipples because i liked design better . it seemed me newer design more correct suckling . i also bought lot new boxes liners thrift store too ! my daughter suffered mild gas , but nothing major . i liked these bottles because liner idea my best friend used them . i wish nipples would come more than two stages though because when my daughter hit 4 months , slow flow too slow fast flow too fast . i ended up putting straight pins slow flow boiling them pins open holes little more . it worked fine ! only time bottle ever leaked when i used drop-in liners that because it wasn't seated right rim bottle . many reviewers complained drop-ins don't hold full 8 ozs . they correct . solve this problem , i simply stuck standard liners i don't buy playtex brand . i buy parent choice ( pc ) brand walmart . thing careful measurements aren't always correct . i bought target brand 4 oz . liners realized ( after several bottles ) 4 oz . mark liner only 3 ozs . pc liners correct ! all-in-all , i like these bottles but am getting tired liners . i am currently reading reviews other bottles considering switching our next child . i'm really liking what i'm reading dr. brown , but possibly try couple other brands well . i'm realizing saving tons money isn't always what best my daughter . we'll see !	-1
i twin girls ( 8 months old ) once they learned sit up they no longer wanted lay back original tub i bought them . i tried fix it so they could sit up , but it complicated , they just not comfortable . i bought snug tub jr. so they could place sit enjoy bath time safely . even better ... i bought two snug tubs they both fit our standard tub . they sit up , face each other inflated sides make me feel comfortable they won't hit their heads . only bad thing i say it little hard close plastic stopper . but overall , we love it	1
we've using peg perego newest sip car seat since our son 6 weeks old . our son loves this car seat ... he never fusses it always happy go ride ! other posters mentioned seat angle very high upright . we personally didn't find this problem it helps our son reflux . poster mentioned straps uncomfortable , however pads shoulder straps included purchase . we found canopy quite sufficient . we older primo viaggio 2002 like features 2006 version ever better . yes , it expensive but imo safety seat worth it . plus , you don't re-thread straps everytime you need readjust shoulder height	1
these things great ! if you colicky baby ( most us some extent ) read " happiest baby block " get swaddleme baby wrap . yes you learn how swaddle blanket , but these so much easier , part because how many large square blankets you actually see out there ( required swaddling) ? only downside us velcro loop section wears out 2-3 weeks depending usage levels . not huge problem , since need swaddling usually ends around 3 months , they aren't expensive . it would also nice loop section larger , accommodate longer skinny babies . our son bit too long small , but waay skinny large	-1
i live studio apt . limited space this perfect me . i love storage bottom i keep all my sons blankets sheets there . it just right size fits snuggly corner . i however same problem mom . my son likes scoot himself diagionally ends up sleeping his face against wall . but his nose not press against it walls ventilated so i dont worry much . i cats canopy works perfect keeping them out sleeper . sheets very pricey 15$ each one my complaints . i like fact matress wipeable surface . it so much easier clean . i would recommend this product anyone ; well grandparets who looking something when thier grandkids come visit	-1
used 2 kids so far ... good : * it protects his feet/arms getting stuck slats . * when they pull up , they chew material instead wood . * easy remove wash . bad : * velcro straps bottom aren't long enough so they don't stay . * head foot pieces slide down when pulled . * first son pulled one those pieces down climbed up it . if this all you get , i'd get it , but it need some improvements .	-1
i like these clear . unfortunately my daughter stopped using pacifier , but when she use it , i liked able still see her beautiful face	1
i * love * this product . it far better velcro swaddler than other brands because it uses bigger patches velcro . comparison blanket , this much easier use provides much more durable swaddles . i'm quite good blanket , but six weeks age , my son could wriggle out . other hand , three months , he never wriggled out cotton flannel swaddleme . however , even cold weather , microfleece too hot . several times i've felt under blanket find my son sweaty . it even worse when we combine swaddle sling . other hand , cotton knit ( solid colors ) blankets too stretchy - my son quickly converts his knit swaddleme into toga , leaving both arms flying free . cotton flannel ( gingham prints ) less stretch than other two fabrics , plenty enough cover keep baby warm indoor temperatures . it trickier find , but worth search . microfleece swaddleme , however , make great non-swaddle blanket cold days , particularly when baby front carrier . velcro quite versatile .	-1
i've used all sorts medela pumps , hospital grade lactina , symphony , pis advanced just good if not better . i didn't like symphony all b/c diaphragm goes machine really tight or it won't good suction ( which most time ) . i'm my third pis advanced . my first child , i pis advanced backpack , first generation , pumped year . amount milk adequate ( enough frozen away extra month after i stopped ) . i just didn't like faceplate ( i broke 3 , where you attach tubing faceplate ) , storage space backpack very limited . then i bought pis advanced shoulder bag my second child . storage area better but faceplate still same . then pis advanced limited edition came out . i saw it fell love it . so i get it . it nicest one thus far long overdue . motor sits separate bag tubing fit side pocket . there no danger breaking faceplate . i just carry work . i two sets parts , one home one work ) . bag lots storage space best all , it chic . they blue , chocolate black . it also doubles diaper bag me . hands free pumping : only reason i able pump year fist time now 11mo still going b/c hands free pumping kit . you get medela softcup bras ( they're comfy anyway ) supports handsfree pumping . there 2 tabs inside bottom one latch top . you don't need buy whole hands free pumping kit ; you just need loop hook attachment ( part #3007073 ) . hooks onto top bra where there latch . then you tie rubber band ( thicker kind any office supply store ) around tabs ( 3 them , two sewn bra one loop hook attachment ) . then you put breastshield connector bottles attached your breast . then you loop rubber band separately around connector ( part where you're suppose attach tubing ) . connect tubing , viola , it should stay there snugly . you don't hold them anymore . you also use this method softfit breastshield . if you larger breasts , use bigger rubberbands or link two together . now you massage get more milk , eat lunch , type computer , whatever ( just can't lie down ) . you buy adapter avent system pump directly into their bottles , or other brands . there no need pump every 3-4h after your milk supply established ... that insane . first few weeks it may necessary establish supply . i pumped 4 times day able get min 30oz day ( i bottle feeding breastmilk exclusively ) , then slowly decreased 3 , 2 1 my baby got older . key pump all milk out ( massaging squeezing your breast ) then let it run 1-2min longer . also , use maximum suction you tolerate ( this increase plateau you pump ) . if you want decrease supply , just pump shorter longer period time lapse pumping . if you want increase , pump longer more frequently well drink more water/eat more . i could increase decrease my supply , even without breastfeeding . i pumped directly into 9 oz or 11 oz avent bottles using avent adapter ( avail babiesrus ) . there other systems out there . i used lansinoh milk storage bags store my milk . i store 10-12oz ( max 12oz ) each bag , squeeze all air out , deep freeze it 6mo . i know lansinoh suggest less than , but it long you get all air out . trick use side table , push milk up ziplock squeeze close ziplock air pushed out . since there two zippers , little milk leak out first zipper help get all air out . bag expand freezer just fine . once it frozen , just don't nick bag ( b/c it easy damage it ) it stay fine 6mo deep freezer . even if you damage bag , it ok . it just pain when you thaw it . when you thaw milk , you might see little precipitate , but baby likes milk just like it fresh . happy pumping	-1
i am daily user pump style advanced breast pump very happy product . i've replace adapter ice pack which after contacting medela company , they replaced it free shipped items out me pronto ! make sure extra membranes hand they wear out after frequent use ; this affect efficiency pumping if you faulty membranes . their customer service line also helped me out troubleshooting which i greatly appreciated well . i've pumping 9 1/2 months now plan go full year help my medela breast pump .	1

several months research combined real-world experience pushing my nieces nephews different strollers brought us around bob revolution . we wanted stroller could handle rough/uneven sidewalks , cobblestone streets , off-road trails . we also wanted use same stroller mall , grocery store , small shops . we compact , lightweight stroller travel , so we focused three-wheelers air-filled tires , rotating front wheel ( must-have feature 3-wheelers ! ) , canopy excellent coverage . we looked strollers mountain buggy , valco , baby jogger , phil ted , dreamer designs , etc . ( we willing spend good amount quality stroller , but we not go bugaboo ) . we decided bob revolution we very happy it . pros1 . it very easy push over all kinds surfaces up hill well steer one hand . 2 . canopy far best we've seen any kind stroller . 3 . front wheel swivels 360 degrees lock . 4 . it folds/unfolds easily . 5 . seat roomy seems reasonably comfortable . 6 . shock absorbers more than few other strollers shocks . 7 . stroller this size/category , it not too wide , so we bring it into small shops navigate tight aisles turns easily . 8 . although not compact , least this stroller folds up decent size easy fit into car - most strollers this category much longer little wider than this when folded up . 9 . wheels easily removable . 10 . not too heavy - lighter than similar strollers this type . 11 . plenty accessories available . 12 . good , rugged build quality . 13 . wheels made sturdy plastic = nothing rust . cons1 . seat not recline very far , it requires you adjust two straps ( one either side top seat back ) . 2 . footrest not adjustable , i would preferred metal/plastic kick plate . 3 . when you fold stroller , it little awkward carry because front wheel sticks out you can't keep it folded up without rigging wrist strap - simple locking mechanism would better . 4 . storage basket could little bigger . 5 . handlebar not adjustable , however it high enough me ( over 6 ' tall ) . 6 . seat could use little more padding . our son seems more comfortable our little combi . 7 . no included accessories . keep mind this kind stroller typically stored garage not folded up all time . this excellent stroller worth money . fyi , here main reasons why we selected this stroller over similar ones : mountain buggy - canopy doesn't provide much sun protection , too big when folded , seat seams uncomfortable ( hammock style , limited padding = squishes child shoulders ); great build quality though easy fold up . valco - too difficult fold up , expensive ; fancy stroller good padding ; optional toddler jumper seat looks uncomfortable toddler if used more than briefly . phil ted - seems less sturdy , fabric footrest too close wheel so kids actually push impede front wheel ; optional second seat innovative design , but sacrifices storage area . alternative : we were'nt able actually see/test one , but boogie zooper looks interesting because it great feature set , adjustable footrest kickplate , full reclining seat back , comes great accessories . apparently , 2006 model redesigned lighter fix some issues older models	-1
one coolest features this stroller front wheel you either lock into position or unlatch so it rotates . turns dime so smooth push it actually makes using this fun . shocks great , baby isn't getting jolted around like his regular stroller . very pricey , but if you afford it , well worth cost	1

i bought this my four month old daughter . within two weeks she already sitting up unassisted more than few seconds because bumbo . it satisfies it job sitting aid , baby enjoys it 7-8 minutes time . first , i bit hesitant buying this due it high price , but i gave . am i glad i ? i think i could saved my money used my baby bouncer same purpose .	-1
monitor works perfectly , no hum or buzzing sounds , it really silent until your baby makes sound . also range very good , much better than any other unit i tried before .	1
i like this because it very easy setup ( it unfolds quite magically ) strap goes under mattress keeps it quite securely close bed . only complaint i they don't include any height adjusters it . so i order them seperately . we decided baby needed sleep slight incline , so we ordered foam wedge amazon	-1

i use this pump all time- 95% my baby feedings . i actually 2 them . i keep one car clean bottle all times one house . pump easy clean , comes spare parts . this manual pump comfortable use . i know all experts recommend electric pumps , but i just fine using this manual pump saved ton money over electric pumps . avent bottles fit directly only this pump , so it quick simple take full bottle off pump either freeze it sealing disc , feed your baby putting nipple top , or store it fridge nipple top storage cap . i must note however 1 my pumps older version this model other newest version . newest current version leaks little where screw grooves pump meet bottle , older version different part not . so , just bit careful when using this otherwise you'll drops milk your clothes	1

i love this diaper bag . first , it doesn't look like diaper bag . it pass purse looks very sporty . i don't feel like frumpy mom while carrying this . also , it carries quite bit without looking bulky . i regulary carry wipes , diapers my infant my potty-training toddler , plus least one change clothes each child two larger compartments . i still room my keys , wallet , cell phone , sun glasses , hair brush two inner zippered pockets . i only gave it 4 stars because shoulder strap needs little more padding . but , overall , it great diaper bag .	-1

this walker very easy put together . it doesn't need any tools assemble it , just open battery compartment ( small flat head screwdriver ) . instructions clear easy follow . walker itself looks cheap but actually i surprised how sturdy it once put together . i say washable seat this little tough snapping into place so i won't want remove it much wash it ... still small price pay safety . front wheels casters which rotate complete 360 . back wheels jsut go forward or backwards ... this safety feature , traction strips underside walker . baby only able move backwards first , but little time , s/he cruising all over . i am little concerned activity toys tray . reviews , it looks like baby may bang her mouth little . if case , it take me 2 minutes detatch toys save it later when she more control . also , sound toys actually not bad . most toys 2 volume settings ; loud louder ... this one ( my opinion)actually 2 real volue conrols ... soft medium . still if i ever get annoyed noise , i turn it off flipping switch ... or just let battery run ou t.t he worst part whole thing adjsuting it different height levels ... i found it easier turn walker upside down adjsut it way ... still , my thumbs bruised days all pressure it took adjust . hope this helps ... definately worth $40	-1

i went back forth before i finally decided add this my baby registry . i received it gift i'm so glad i registered it . true , velcro isn't too strong , which makes it slip if alot heavy items placed it . however , i used strategy reviewer used tied it crib some pretty ribbon it works wonderfully . i powder , lotion , baby oil , vaseline , some shoes , well package diapers few more items stored it it holding up fine . i think this organizer very useful convenient way keep much needed items close hand , especially if you lacking storage space . i would definitely recommend this item anyone i'm so glad i finally register it . only reason i not give it 5 stars because i make adjustment , using ribbons instead velcro it came . otherwise , i no other complaints	-1

it not clearest or easiest use , but it work . you tell difference baby other sounds . it pretty sensitive we've happy it . i don't think you go wrong money . if i grading it value money , i'd give it higher rating . but i'm rating it based what it over others i've seen or heard	-1

our son almost 16 months old we using these sippy cups 10 months now . we never them leak , mold , spouts push through or anything ! i suggest reading directions before tossing these sippy cups trash . i cannot get over how many parents assume avent line alot " hype " just because they failed read directions . complaints mold sour milk ... that just gross . wash sippy cup after it used . i'm sure any other brand would get moldy smelly if you left it your trunk all summer ... not avent fault ! anyway , green spouts stiffer than white ones more difficult clean ... ok , maybe first few times because they new ; but they get more pliable . i spoke avent rep baby fair edison , nj she suggested buying new spouts every month or so ( same nipples avent bottles ) . they wear out ... especially if you're using same two or three sippy cups every day . i just bought ( tried ) " sport spout " although it quite mouthful liquid comes out , our son no problem spout , either . no leaks so far . all all , read directions you see leaks disappear like magic ! good luck	1
service target very good . item arrived good condition quite fast . walker although not colorful it seems picture but good enuff keep my son engaged . it safe same time glides both carpet vinyl floor .	-1
my granddaughter , age 7 mos ., enjoying her new-found freedom i think this product well worth money . folding , take , feature great they live quite distance me this makes walker easier pack .	1
i started out pumping thought i would store all my milk medela bottles . when i realized how much milk i would need store , i quickly realized would cost me arm leg ( bottles run 20 bucks 4 ! ) came upon these little wonders . they made thick polyethylene plastic ( safe long-term storage ) you can't beat zip-loc style closure compared other tie bags ... those scared me , every drop truly precious . granted , they bit awkward first because you dealing container much less sturdy than plastic bottles most women pump into but it works well once you get used it .	1
my newborn hated tummy time floor . would lay his head down just cry , just like my daughter . i bought lamaze spin explore , he loved it . within days , he could hold his head all way up minutes time , now he four months old , he spins himself around playing different toys attached . great buy	1
my son smaller version ( 11 " ) fluffles ( aka lambchop ) since birth . he now 9 months old " lambchop " go everywhere he goes . needless say lambchop gets very used . label says surface clean only , but my mother keeps our son she decided one day try wash lambchop . he really needed good washing because our son going through heavy drooling stage lambchop fur getting crunchy . well , he made it through gentle cycle through dryer ( rack air fluff cycle ) . he washed this way several times . he comes out so nice fluffy . course , wash your own risk , but it works us . i am going purchase our son larger version ( 14 " ) fluffles . this so handy event we retire original fluffles ( lambchop ) , fluffles able grow our son , also . we love this toy	1
our son , now 3 mo old , great sleeper when he swaddled this thing . without it he thrashes his arms legs startles himself awake . it he settles down sleeps like champ . we've using it since he newborn . little square velcro doesn't hold bottom part well all , but it winter so we dress him sleeper jammies underneath swaddleme anyway so it not big issue . when we came home hospital first we tried swaddling using receiving blankets but our son wiggled right out . we're huge fans swaddleme now give it our standard baby shower gift .	-1

three children our household , we've seen our share good back educational toys . this one one best , particularly households want promote musical affinity . it provides endless combinations choices depending where child places cube . it also gives three different " styles " music : jazzy , classical funk . only reservation i it may little difficult babies less than 1 year old .	1
overall we quite happy bundleme , which fits perfectly into our infant car seat ( graco snugride ) . product good quality , though zippers not running very smoothly . regarding its design , only downside we see front part very loose , making it difficult get tight enough fit around baby neck shoulders keep him warm colder weather . bottom line , however , it good product we recommend .	-1
this great purchase . bag fit my britax boulevard carseat gogobabyz wheels attached it . i able wheel my baby car seat airport up gate then easily place carseat wheels into bag gate check it . it kept car seat clean i able store extra blanket inside bag .	1
we used this carrier while trip florida . it very convenient use wheel through airport since we dont check carseat so we use it plane . since bag 2 zippers it , we actually able leave my sleeping daughter car seat bag zippers part way down each side so her face out . this way i didnt carry sleeping baby other bags through aiirport- i just pulled her car seat since it wheels . she fell asleep her carseat while plane didnt wake up until after we got off plane , picked up our baggage , got our rental car , put her car seat car traveling our destination . we also used eddie bauer bag past trip - strap broke while carrying it through airport it doesnt wheels so it much more difficult carry .	1

i just purchased this cool , wet spring months new england . i also bundle me original which great winter months . this nice alternative when original becomes too warm use , but you still need little something . inner lining soft against your baby skin outside lining protects him/her against cool weather rain . only negative thing i say this it not fit well my car seat original . it tends slide down little . i new graco safe seat which larger than most car seats so this could reason . it may fit better smaller car seats . i also love pink " girly " color . now weather warming up bit , it works great when going into air conditioned buildings just little too cool baby . it also nice barrier sun harmful rays	-1
this lamp perfect my baby nursery . it matches all other hello kitty stuff	1
after reading other reviews this product i felt i needed put positive spin this product . i registered this item received it my shower . my son 5 1/2 months old severly congested . i took box out his closet set up machine . after first night ( 10 hours ) he woke up first time 2 weeks able drink his bottle out me using saline drops aspirator . i am continuing use this product every night every morning much more pleasant . noise level i not find issue . i don't problem hearing my son cry or even move around monitor . i feel noise actually soothing child helps fade out other noise house . i am glad i got this product would personally recommended it anyone . i understand this product little pricey but i believe it worth every penny !!!!!	1
finally bottle easy clean my baby loves ! we through every bottle out there wasted so much money i vowed never try -- but when my second baby refused bottle ( i settled playtex my son because it problem-free ) refused playtex , i tried these . it only bottle she take . she also breastfed , so i'm not sure if these just better breastfed babies , but she no gas problems these , they incredibly easy . also cool how cover fits bottom bottle so if you out it easy find .	1
our son would never take paci if it weren't soothies !!! there no giving it up now ! -- now we same nipple our bottle . no more nipple confusion ! :op they great , no complaints . i don't know why previous reviewer only gave 4 stars . if you don't screw any bottle tight enough it leaks ... duh !	1
this 4th stroller i've purchased . i lightweight combi great travel it folds tiny only $40 . but it not going hack it everyday use . larger travel system stoller i so cumbersome stores difficult load into trunk . this aria very easy , looks great , lightweight found balance small sturdy . i love it . i recommend it other moms when i get chance . peg great reputation lasting , so i hope this " entry level " price point meets expectation . so far i feel like it great value far strollers go	-1
twins we always write down everything , or we wouldn't remember whom we feed , when we feed them , or any details . we used keep chart , but then i received itzbeen gift . it so much faster press button then write everything down . when we go out i just toss it my purse when babies start crying i just pull out itzbeen look timers figure out if it time eat or they just fussy . if boys eat or require diaper change , i record it easily . no more carrying around clipboard ! i didn't give it 5 stars because it would even better if it could track how many oz formula babies eat if it could total number hours baby slept . but still it nice tool forgetful people . i'm buying 2nd one , so i one each my twins	-1
i bought this upon recommendation my lactation consultant , so far i've very pleased . i wanted few bottles breastmilk available so my husband could feed our baby when i'm out running errands . there just few parts , so assembly , disassembly , cleaning very easy . but best part pump , you buy different-sized breastshields use it . i needed larger one than what came standard it . it makes pumping more comfortable . first few times i used it , i considered switching electric pump because i wasn't pumping much milk . but more i pumped , more milk i produced . this breastpump worth every penny . i recommend it anyone who primarly breastfeeds , but wants option able someone else occasionally feed baby .	1
my son 7 weeks old using snuggle nest my bed since he 3 weeks old . he loves his snuggle nest began sleeping 3-4 hours time very 1st night it . we now use it combination swaddle me wrap techniques i learned free happiest baby block dvd came our snuggle nest . thanks this wonderful combo our 7 week old baby sleeps through night ( 7-8 hrs ) . this my 3rd baby 1st i used snuugle nest or swaddling he 1st sleep so well so early . if i could give this product 10 stars i would . i also plan use snuggle nest when/if we transition our baby his crib month or two , i am sure it make transition easier him	1
i recomend this item parents who want peace mind while their baby asleep . it protects child rolling onto his/her side allows parents sleep their baby without fear smuthering baby . however it best if you king size bed . my huband i sleep either edge bed while baby asleep us , feeling little cramped	1
my son great time his bath turtles . he learned colors play features each turtle , so that educational plus i not expect all ! somehow , turtles end up floating upside down during bath time -- splash factor , maybe ? but that half fun -- making him turn them over again more play . they easy clean dry so that plus . one bath turtle i don't completely understand one mirror inside . because temperature water , it causes condensation protective plastic bubble , so he can't see mirror anyway , so what point one ? nevertheless , he kinda looks it middle his bath probably thinks , " hey , i there minute ago ... " he picks one up , holds it up his eye level , struggles find himself second , laughs , puts it back water picks up turtle . go figure . it still good fun him , turtles keep him occupied during shampooing what not , therefore , they're okay me ! totally safe drain proof	1
i hate think all germs shopping carts . i always used this seat cover never let my son touch shopping carts or restaurant high chairs . too bad 26 months he now too big it now sits those germ infested car shopping carts . oh well . purchase this product you won't disappointed . i washed it often it lived trunk my car . i say i not put it carry bag form because it took too long get it way , but it didn't matter anyway it quicker put it grocery cart when it not bag form . great baby shower gift	1
i nursed my now 4-year-old daughter almost year pumped daily . i hated always boil pump 20 minutes , which also tough pump plastic parts , which would yellow until i replaced them . now i am nursing my 3-month-old son . i thrilled find these micro-steam bags ! i use them not only sterilize pump after each use , but also bottles . ( though i pump daily , i only occasionally use bottles , so always boiled them , too - this sooooooo much easier ! ) i am so glad they came out this product - it just makes things lot easier ! it so inexpensive , too !	1
not much it , just swatch cloth really . but it what it says it	-1
i using avent on-the-go pump set over 4 1/2 months now , i think pump very easy use . i find it very comfortable , am easily able pump 4 or more ounces under 10 minutes . i used medela electric pump ( i not know which model ) once found avent isis manual pump allowed me pump more milk less time . * only * thing i would suggest new mothers ( their significant others ) practice assembling pump few times prior arrival their little one . i found first week my baby life i too overwhelmed sit down read avent instructions how put pump together correctly .	1
these very convenient if your child already using avent bottles . if you use medela pump , you get adapter pump straight into these containers , eliminating step breastmilk collection chain . i also find small sizes convenient , especially if you normally pump four ounces or less out one or both breasts . i didn't give this product five stars , though , because , really , these just four more avent bottles sealing disc . if you bunch bottles anyway , you just buy pack sealing discs $4 use those instead .	-1
we used avent our 1st baby loved it . now we expecting munchkin , we planning using them again . i loved these . i loved how simple it made it store my milk . straight isis pump my fridge/freezer . simple . yes , defrosting takes longer than some alternatives , but i always bottle fridge while one defrosting . i found warming it boiling pot water work best quick defrost . they take up more room than bags when storing , but i think convience outweighed problem . i stored milk fridge freezer learned rotate so room wasn't terrible problem . ( if you this , it important label date containers ) this also saved me defrosting last minute . i some leaking issues time time , but figured it out . if you tighten container/bottle too much it leak . simple fix ... don't over-tighten . ( avent site short trouble shooting list leakage problems ) we tried other products , but avent best our family .	1
i use these storage containers mixing breast milk rice cereal feed my daughter while we out . i love these containers this use . i don't any problem leaking i feed my daughter straight out jar . i gave these 4 stars because i didn't get any use out these storing breastmilk freezer ( which why i registered them first place ) . it takes forever defrost breastmilk these bottles . i just ended up using lansinoh gerber milk storage bags because they defrosted quickly took up much less room freezer	-1
my baby also cereal thickened formula his really bad reflux ( ordered his doctor i might add ) . these nipples work great long formula too thick use regular stage 1 or 2 nipple . only problem i found these nipples you gentle when you using nipple brush clean them so you don't tear y-cut opening ..... 2 our nipples tore cuts causing hole become larger . but gentler cleaning checking nipples before each use remedied this problem . also want add my son started using these nipples age 2 months no problems sucking them .	1
i combi until few days ago , i loved it but basket just too small , it net kind . i also wanted snack tray my one-yr old son . also i felt my son already growing out it . i alot research , wanted light , easy-to-handle stroller bit bigger than my combi . i purchased aria few days ago , after alot steering store , my son it . i found no problem steering , matter fact it so easy steer , even one hand . my son more elbow room his new stroller , snack tray great . i don't use 5pt harness much , but times i i no problem it . basket great , lots room . far cup holder parent , it isn't big any means , but i never carry around 32 oz big gulp , so it isn't problem me . i usually small bottle water or small starbucks cup . unless you travel large cups or bottles , it works just fine . i am very happy this stroller , weight it carrying handle both wonderful	1

okay first off i didn't get this babiesrus because they wanted charge arm leg ship it . however i got great deal it babysupermall.com , i ordered it week christmas got it same week . shipping free thats great when you purchase something you can't see person . i love it ! looks really adorable white crib . very good quality colors it would go great lavendar or pink room . we our daughter room dark pink bottom white chairrail , light pink above chairrail white crown molding . add wall decorations other accessories its tooooo cute . go website i mentioned find all accessories this . also you'll save pocketbook shipping , especially if you want whole collection	1
they soft pretty colors . very absorbant . i started off prefolds covers moved contours . my baby chubby legs day one these leave no red marks ... some fitteds tended too .. i love use these , they fun easy use . i no problems snappi these . sometimes i even let her run around without cover just kissaluv snappi . pretty reasonably priced . easy wash dry . they tend get folded up dryer , so i go midway unfold them continue run dryer they work well . excellent fit . i use med/large ones my 24 pound baby . she able fit into small ones even until she 20 pounds . close fit , but they fit . med/ large ones better fit her . they nice trim you use them inside pocket diaper too . i would use them again ... i would recommend these any day ...	1
this pop-up seat great table or go . my one-year old loves it ! it sits him up lot higher table than if we use high chair table . it so convenient take places where we know there won't somewhere him sit . it great restaruants too because he very wiggly it keeps him seated he comfortable it unlike those restaraunt highchairs	1
person i gave this gift just love it because their young baby look more secure while napping	1
i love this cup ! these best cups i ever bought . my daughters loves them too . they don't any valves inside , so you don't worry taking anything out , or forgetting put them back , or even them falling out . they don't leak , they just wonderful . i love them !	1
i've this bag well over year now . i toddler preschooler it works just fine carry their stuff mine everyday outings . it also held up well . i've washed it few times it comes out looking very good . i really like separate compartments which make it much easier find one little thing . i like pockets front strap cell phone nuk . so nice those right hand . i also like fact it goes across body ... no more hitting my daughter diaper bag when i lean down pick her up . bottle holder thing very small , so i don't really use it .	1
people may say leash my kid inhumane , but i'd rather than they get run over car or lost mall . my kids love wearing these things , they look cute . leash part tail little annoying if my toddler lagging , she gets mad cause i'm pulling tail up over her shoulder .	-1
very happy product extremely pleased customer service travelwithkids	1
most diaper hangers one compartment big stack disposables . we use variety cloth diapers this organizer great because it space hold our prefolds , fitteds , doublers , pockets inserts , covers . i haven't loaded heavy things onto it , but i've never problem shelves unstable reviewer	1
top clip not difficult me use but my daughter hasn't figured it out yet - which way i want it . i've also used it booster i satisfied way buckle looped through stayed place . i also like strap bottom allows me add little slack or tighten it little . i think that really important feature - especially this season when my kid may wearing jacket one day none next also if you use car seat different kids similar but not exactly same size . i car seat without i find sometimes i can't get it closed because it too tight sometimes there too much slack	1
over-all these pretty good bottles . only thing i feel could use some improvement shape top bottle , it little bit too wide . example : when you get end feeding tilt bottle upward get last 1/2 ounce or so , base nipple actually touching babies nose . other than , these great bottles . they resonably priced , never any problems w/ leaking absolutely love cap snaps onto bottom bottle , genius !	-1
this crib makes our nursery ! every person seen room comments what beautiful crib this . wood very thick expensive looking very inexpensive price . crib very sturdy when put together , no movable parts ( front piece doesn't lower ) it very safe baby . knowing this crib grow my baby through toddler childhood years reassuring too . i'm glad i purchased this crib ! you can't beat quality price	1
cherry wood itself very great , however , painting easy scratched during delivery installation . both packaging delivery should more careful . deliverer put it my condo guard while i home , why not sent huge heavy item directly my door ?	-1
this wipes best . it smells good , non-alcoholicand perfect even most sensitive skin . tryit ! you won't regret	1
this activity mat expensive ( i bought it full price almost $60 ) but there lot usage it . i started using it my baby when she 2 months old , she enjoyed seeing colorful toys above her . she grew , she loved her tummy colorful mat , especially crinkling leaf . attached toys excellent themselves i used them clip onto her carseat crib . only when she could finally get up crawl she tire mat . my only criticism " musical " toy dangles . it switch on/off which great . however , volume music loud ! many dark night i tried tiptoe past it heart attack when i accidentally tapped toy music blasted . also , sun-mirror comes off easily hard prop up . again , this well worth it well designed toy any infant .	-1
i afraid order this chair first , too . but mine came yesterday i am ordering 4 more ! it very sturdy easy put table . i worried kids pushing it off underneath their feet , but it some adjustments under there secure it table . there also button each side fold down screw adjustment just slide it off table . it also folds flat . this great my grandkids we always assured clean chair them when dining out ! colors aren't pretty , but it washable	1
after doing lot research , we pretty happy this product . we 4 year old , 2 1/2 year old , 1 year old , one way so we happy there product out there could help our 4 year old when she gets tired walking there no room her stroller :) we attached it our double stroller it works fine . it makes it little heavier awkward fold up but overall we pleased this purchase	1
i just purchased this bath toy organizer i love it ! it fits perfectly into corner our tub holds many toys plus shampoo wash clothes . i hesitant get this item because some other reviews , but i think it great i no regrets buying it ... i only wish i bought it sooner	1

this base graco system whole great , however we put blanket under base get it level up both our vehilce ( 2004 vw jetta , 2002 dodge dakota ) . over all i would recomend it friends family	-1
i love these glass bottles- same ones my mother used 60 i used 80 my first baby am using again my new babies-twins ! they just seem cleaner me- they shine after washed dishwasher .	1
my daughter almost 6 months old slept through whole night wearing her new swaddleme . she normally wakes up frequently because she kicks off her blankets . but last night , she didn't wake up once ! i'm definitely going get one these !	1
when my daughter born , i didn't know swaddling , it would take me hours get her sleep ! i would feed or rock her my arms until she falls asleep , then put her her crib ... she'd flail her arms , wake up cry , i start all over ! what nightmare ! then i figured out since her arms wake her , it would make sense wrap her something so she couldn't move them much ... so i started wrapping her regular receiving blankets . it worked ! it became much easier get her sleep . but then she wiggled out those receiving blankets wake up again . when she little over month old , somehow i came across swaddleme blankets internet immediately bought it . it worked great ! it so easy wrap my daughter it , it stayed put . my daughter started sleeping so much better ! i wish i found those blankets sooner - it would've saved me so many sleepless nights ! 2 years later , my son born , thankfully i already knew those blankets start . he goes sleep great swaddleme blanket ! out curiosity , i tried put him sleep without this blanket , his arms wake him right away - exactly same my daughter ! i consider this blanket one most important baby items you could buy . it should must new mother who wants get some sleep	1
this wonderful ! my 3 month old sleeping 8-9 hours night last month or so thanks this ! we smaller one when she newborn thank goodness they make it larger . she always seemed big swaddle blankets , she would work herself free but this very soothing her . i would recommend it any new parent	1
my daughter loves these bottles , they same her pacifier they work very well . i seen few complaints vents leaking , but really happens all bottles vents these arent nearly bad avent bottles . i am glad i bought these	1
someone wrote this good cloth diapers . only if you put them dry . if you put water ( additive your choice ) put your diapers , this dangerous : babies ( ie ones old enough get pull themselves up ) drowned diaper pails . esp if they step front lid pops open they try reach inside . headfirst . only use diaper pail latches solidly closed if you going put cloth diapers you soak . dry diapers cloth or disposable variety this great buy	-1
this valance great ! i 2 smaller windows my baby girl room able cut valance , sew edges make it fit both windows ! it hangs straight down so you able see all animals i didn't even cut animal half . i gotten so many compliments this pattern - it just best either boy or girl room .	1
i actually received this valance zanzibar bed set . but , if you need purchase one extra window nursery - not hesitate . this beautiful valance actually same lovely fabrics ( including suede like fabric ) textured animals bed skirt , bumper , quilt . i noticed other bed sets ( even expensive ones ) where valances quite plain . valance measure around 90 inches wide . but , meant bunched up look so it looks great narrower windows . also , beige or sage colored drapes or sheers would great complement this valance shield nursery day light during nap time	1
hy wife hard time sleeping while pregnant . one night i watched her toss turn i decided soemthing her . i went target bought her boppy body pillow . night she slpet sound first time over month . she drags thing room room house , she lays it watch tv sleep . it take up some room bed , but it well worth me little less room her sleep sound . also few times i stolen it used it while i lay ground watch football . it very comfy . i never pregnant woman , but what my wife tells me this must	1
target - this re-do review i just sent . please use this one instead i not explain it right first time : love sleek new non-potty design , it gives more sense privacy . no wonder kids not want sit old-fashioned chair ones . different size measurements info informative but need know liquid measurement how much it would safely hold .	1
this great buy ! easy assemble looks gorgeous . one most important things - it very solid .	1
keeps your baby getting foot stuck through side crib , but still fits tightly safely	-1
what godsend this . our daughter 3 years old we take this thing everywhere ! sure , we keep potty-toppers us , but sometimes just isn't enough . this go potty far better than any porta-potty or gross outdoor park restroom . we used this potty park , while making rounds build/construction sites , baseball games , even parking garage our hockey rink ! our daughter use it just anywhere . it small size allows her use it discreetly comfortably . if you ever venture more than 30 seconds clean toilet , you need this . then you'll wonder how you ever got without it	1
we love this crib - we looked several bassinettes pack-n-plays because we wanted our baby our room us first few months before transitioning her her big crib her room , but we also wanted something versatile could used her play ( we hard wood floors i wanted something i could push around house room room so she could me ) . this crib so much more attractive than pack-n-plays but functional lasts so much longer than other cradles or bassinettes . one biggest advantages it fits through doorways , which pack-n-play not , i wanted something i could roll around room room . this useful when she newborn we wanted keep her room us , or just push her next room where we could hear her . i also plan use it roll around house when she older using it play . nice thing it it works just like regular crib side lowers mattress level which two settings . other reviewer right , you push it up your bed if you want co-sleeper type bed , you could even lower side down easy reach baby . i not used it this way but it would perfect thing if my baby got sick . tho other thing i love this crib sleeper or play area , it lasts much longer than bassinnett or cradle - long pack play- i believe up 50 pounds . finally , it really nice looking , since we it our master bedroom , i wanted something would cute not bulky or would stand out too much . this one really attractive . negatives : mattress pretty wimpy , which why i gave this 4 stars . but she , just 6 months , still sleeping it night seems very comfortable it . next baby , i probably look around mattress . other negative crib not travel too well - unlike pack-n-play . it fold up easy storage , but unless you minivan or suv , it still pretty large store trunk - it not fit into our volvo 4-door car trunk . i would also recommend buying one port-a-crib bumper pad sets ( around 40- 50.00 ) babies us because they fit this crib best . i bought 15.00 koala kids bumper pad it too big buckles around bed , so i only recently started using bumper pad fear she would press up against it night . but you need bumper pad crib they get older because they start sticking their legs arms out slats while asleep . nice crib - good choice .	-1

this our second highchair . we owned evenflow discovery highchair found it many problems , so we forced buy better produc t.t his chair worth price . our daughter very tall , but 23 months she still uses this highchair no problems . pros : vinyl seat-makes easy cleanup safety harness superior extra tray very convienent folds up nicely locking wheels seat moves up downcons : release tabs tray easy break . if you don't properly push them or out they snap right off your tray no longer lock place .	1
we bought this high chair our daughter we love it . it easy use set up . i would given five stars but unfold/fold it you need two hands which sometimes isn't too " handy " when you crying baby one them . seat adjusts up down so your child sit right table you . stated above , legs fold together so you store chair when not using . chair cover also easy take off when it needs cleaned(which we tub ) attached snaps . my little one ten months old , 19 pounds , 27.5 inches not even close outgrowing this chair . i definitely recommend this chair . hope this helps !	-1
i one these cribs already my son . we one way when it came choice which crib buy there no question . this crib so versatile . it goes crib toddler bed then full size . we use it years . i'm only 5'4 " tall i little worried side not moving down but it works out great me even when it lowest level . i would recommend this crib anyone	1
this changing pad great investment . i take it everywhere instead lugging around big heavy diaper bag . i am able fit several diapers travel sized bag wipes it . it small enough you could add it your diaper bag well if you would like . i think this also great gift idea	1
my 4.5 month old son loves his jump go . it christmas present santa , my husband i happy it well . i've seen some reviews calling it " dangerous " but i think only danger comes when parents aren't watching their children . we never leave him unattended his jumper we've no problems . first week or so he just kind hung around it , moving around circles . he finally gotten hang jumping he also realizes he one controlling all sounds . only drawbacks i see it , reason i only give 4 out 5 stars , volume setting goes loud extremely loud . i wish there one more quieter setting . also , any doorway jumper , there bit more potential injury than stationary jumpers . but i said before , if you monitor your child , said child should fine . i highly recommend this product	-1
this carseat best ! not only it easiest installation ever ( we actually went back re-read instructions because we couldn't believe it could so easy ) , but it also very safe seat . they special bicycle padding add more protection baby . safety features outstanding . child restraint so easy use non-twisting straps , easy lock system pull belt tighten harness without struggle . , it looks great too ! we explorer print love it . all our chicco products fabulous ( polly high chair playard too )	1
i received crib box shreds . amazingly , all pieces intact because hardware sealed , smaller box . delivery people must stuck some other hardware loose shipping into box , because i got some weren't even part crib ! they must thought pieces fallen out it because it tatters . there few marks metal crib , but if it wood i'm sure it would worse . very disappointed shape box , but crib acceptable	-1

i wanted write review this seat , because after much researching , i couldn't really find any helpful information . i britax blvd . my 15 month old daughter my honda minivan , which she very happy , but it couldn't fit my husband dodge ram 2500 truck . it too tall would leave her too much upright position . after looking back lot other car seats , i felt this would good fit without losing too much comfort my daughter . it fits very nicely extra cab my daughter seems very comfortable . it very easy install it very lightweight . after lugging britax seat all over airport off plane recent trip , i looking forward traveling this one instead . straps not come any covers , but easy fix . adjusting straps fit her very easy there multiple options move them she grows . overall , i think it great seat extra . britax still her main car seat ; i don't think you find better seat than one . if you need seat fit back truck , this good one	-1
my son breast fed baby exclusively 10months , then he cut teeth decided he wanted bite . well , just wasn't gong happen . he would take sippy cup just fine juices such , 5months , but when it came down drinking milk , sippy cup idea didn't seem appeal him , nor bottle . then i got him one avent magic cups ..... he loved it , still , 2years age , it only cup he drink milk . we never problem spilling/leaking , infact , only problem i you can't find avent line locally where i live	1
ok , so it took some work convincing my husband spend $$ this , but pointing out it last all way our son 65lbs helped lot . when it arrived we put our son there he -- happy ! my son never happy car seat but he loved fact he could sit up straighter than his infant seat . he finally sit up like big boy way he wants now he 5 months old supported sitter . i like fact i recline him if he falls asleep , which usually case car . i am sure he also appreciates incredibly soft fabric - i know i would like sit seat soft . considering we travel 4-6 hours visit grandparents , his comfort happiness very important us carseat . we pray we never use all excellent safety features this seat , but it great know this also top line respect .	1

i love this crib set ! i snoopy set porta crib ( i think it recently discontinued ) before i put this one . it cute but bumper didn't fit too well ( kinda awkward uneven ) quality fabrics used fitted sheet bumper felt cheap . i got malawi porta crib set present ( i added it into my registry because i liked colors i thought it looked cute ) . i exchange it store credit because i thought i no use it but i'm glad i didn't . bumper fits almost perfectly feels thicker safer use . i love feel fabrics used whole set . it definitely worth money	1

i really wish i considered metrolite graco system because registering this one . it way too big use daily basis . i love it places like zoo or park but it way wide heavy daily mall , grocery store , errands general . all all i think graco best features strollers , definitly best basket parent trays but i think i try sell this stroller get metrolite so i would use it more .	-1
our son not great sleeper . when he born , my husband , mom i all took turns walking around him all day all night . then we got book happiest baby block tried swaddle him . this would work few minutes , but since he nine pounder , it not stay wrapped . then we got miracle blanket . it great ! we got stretches 4 hours sleep time . we so glad we discovered this blanket made sure it first thing we located when we found out we baby	1
i bought this when i pregnat my second baby . i love it . it keeps him securely wrapped all night . my only complaint it not designed larger babies . my son 10# birth he fit it perfectly . now 2mo he 15.5 # over 25in blanket getting little small him . we still use it every night , he just sticks out top little more , i tuck tail his back instead front	1
i've using these store milk 6 months now , i love them . ( i use 8 oz size ) they stack together so they don't take up too much room my bag morning . ( i work 12 hour shifts 3 days week-so need take several every day ) they sit upright so they don't leak my cooler or refrigerator work ( avoids gross-out factor co-workers bags ) i recently bought adaptors pump directly into them , love them even more . also , my husband handle milk when i am work , these way easier him than bags , so he wastes less milk spilling , etc . my only comment you careful not overfill them , breast milk expands when it freezes , pop off lid or crack container . but this would concern any storage container , bags included . hate way breast milk storage bags leak when they thawing out , no matter how flat you try freeze them , they never stack up well , so you end up avalanche bags falling out freezer . i love these containers sturdy plastic stack up freezer , they don't require special handling thaw avoid contaiminating milk . buying bases lids separately , containers not meant used more than three times before they discarded , while lids hold up much longer , so i'm glad i only buy what i need time , so no wasted money or extra supplies store . cost , other similar containers cost $3-4 each , so $15 10 lids bases seems very reasonable	1
i bought this product put our pack play living room it works perfectly . i our wipes container top , diapers under , one side i diaper rash cream , comb some other things other side we our remote controls our phone . it works great	1

i bought my 7month old daughter nicest model infant safe seat(it central park pattern)about month ago . before i dared buy any kind car seat my daughter again i made sure i read over every parent review i could find(so i thank those who reviewed this before me , they big help ) . i found few complaints i this carseat myself after testing it out stores . i'll post few possible solutions i've found . complaint #1 : it too big fit top shopping carts . i don't like it , but apparrently you're not even supposed put carseat/carriers shopping carts . it throws off balance cart cause cart tip over super easy what i've heard . i think graco actually makes them so they don't fit reason . complaint #2 : metallic or nylon-like fabric uncomfortable baby my daughter hated metallic nylon fabric when i tried her into them store so we bought pattern didn't it(central park ) . you check gracobaby.com see other patterns don't it . thats where we found ours . complaint #3 : waist belts angle leaving marks babys ' thighs . my daughter got marks first time she wore sunsuit it but now i just pull dress part down her skin belts . angle though so waist belts sit pelvis(or close possible newborn ) , which safest ideal place them sit baby . complant #4 : its ' too big fit most cars i thought sure it wouldn't fit our car especially because our snug ride barely squeezed backseat . but oddly enough this thing fits better into our old beat up 1992 chevy lumina(the sedan not minivan)than snug ride . if you've ever seen those old cars you'd know when front seat(s ) pushed all way back there pretty much no room any kind rear facing carseat . infant safe seat installed properly my husband still put front seats all way back . this thing still fits into cars better than any convertible carseat . before deciding infant safe seat i tried graco , evenflo , britax , eddie bauer convertible seats into car . complaint #5 : it heavy bulky . it bulky , but how else could it accomadate higher weight height limit . heavy graco says it only weighs 5 pounds more than old(20lb , 26 " )snug ride . babies ' ' us i tried holding our old snug ride(26 " , 20lbs ) infant safe seat both hands compare weight even switched hands , but couldn't tell difference . i also tried my daughter it carried her around store . i think because size it makes it easier carry bigger/heavier babies , because my 18lb 27 " daughter lot more difficult carry her now out-grown snug ride . i like even once i no longer carry her around it i'll still convenience travel system beyond first year if my daughter sleeping . that something no other carrier ( or convertible carseat ) offer . complaint #6 : it doesn't fit over-turned wooden highchairs i made it point try carrier restauraunt high chairs when i got it . i tried it 4 different restauraunts not any more trouble than i snug ride . so far what i've seen they've fit perfectly . complaint #7 : stroller matches carseat quite large most patterns only offer quattro tour stroller match it , however 3 nicest patterns/models , samba , collection , central park also offer matching metrolite stroller , fusion patter also offers matching mosaic stroller , however pierson pattern only offers matching mosaic stroller . quattro tour stroller full size stroller so it heavier , bulkier , more nifty features , than metrolite mosaic stollers . so keep mind when choosing stroller . complaint #8 : it too big newborns . 3 nicest patterns/models infant safe seats come infant headbody support , though it isn't greatest if it doesn't work your baby then you just buy kiddopottomus snuzzler infant headbody support . it actually reversible made out super soft velboa material one side other soft woven fabric . i buy one my daughter when she born because she only 6lbs 12.5 oz . she so small even her snug ride looked like it swallowed her up when i buckled her into it . i've actually seen other reviews recommending snuzzler newborns who're going infant safe seat . complaint #9 : head support carrier comes doesn't work you even buy separate ( double)head supports snug rides ( even ones come single one ) unless you buy one nicest snug ride models comes double head supports . head support comes most infant safe seats made more older napping babies . i recommend especially baby double head supports if you don't get snuzzler because they're made 100% jersey knit cotton , back head supports slightly padded , they're deeper than any other head supports i've seen , so they hold babys ' head better , you get them quite few different colors match your car seat	1
this our second boulevard model carseat we love both them . my only complaint it hard get it centered/level back seat when it rear facing ( i 04 camry my husband 06 corolla ) . tether wants pull it one side or other . we also pull out back support pillow order get latches click without cutting off circulation our daughter legs . but cover very luxurious - more so than you see picture . i holding out shannon cover but britax kept pushing release date back , i needed get seat quickly my daughter outgrowing her infant seat . i very , very happy when i saw how pretty cover . other than asthetics seat , it seems very solid safe , i am very comfortable knowing it keeping my daughter safe secure when we driving	-1
this item great . bit frustration first putting poles together , but then again it just like tent i get frustrated those . item works great keeping cat out playpen actually holds weight which i kind leary . not used cabana portion yet , but hopefully this summer . overall i am extremely happy product it durability .	1
tubing works perfect you would expect medela . however , i received it seller zip-lock bag , literally . no factory seal , no mention medela name anywhere . this came flyer advising me if i open use product , ( it single-user only ) , it not refundable . however , there no way me sure noone used it . , it basically came already open	1
i first bought safefit mirror , not pleased it . i bought this mirror because remote . i ford freestyle headrest middle , so it fit perfectly not block my view . i bought mirror , so she would something other than carseat look while i'm driving , not so i could look her , even though i see her my rearview mirror . i used it passenger seat see her , relocate pacifier . what i like it once you turn it , it stays . i don't turn it every five minutes like some toys . it also adjustable noise levels , lights and/or music , but you obviously can't front seat , so i leave it same setting . i no problem turning it remote , i it clipped my sun visor , it works there ( but angle right my car , i guess ) . only complaint i would lights hard see daytime , but she seems entertained what she sees mirror music , night watches lights . it little more expensive , but worth money my opinion .	1

i absolutely love this stroller because its size weight . it very light just enough pockets hold few diapers wipes few toys other side . cup holder top nice addition too . it very easy manage fits perfectly my wife trunk , taking up very little space . my only real complaint canopy . it undersized flimsy . only way it blocks sun if it directly overhead noon . otherwise , canopy pretty much useless because sun always our little girls ' eyes . all all , i'd recommend this due enough features easy use overcome canopy issue .	-1

before my daughter born i bought all sorts cute cotton bibs like ' i love my mom " etc . soon after she started solids i quicly learnt these got soiled easily it tough keep them clean . then trip sweden my husband brought baby bjorn ones home wow my life became little easier . i would just toss them dishwasher end day . if i rush i would just rinse them off under tap water . catch all scoop bottom made less messy meal times . it helped great deal when my daughter wanted drink water herself any spillovers not land floor but bib . this certainly money well spent	1
it really easy change stoller stroller . holds bottles , baby bottles , water bottles perfectly . lots pockets my keys , phone , sunglasses , misc . stays upright not tip down .	1
i don't know what i would without this chair . it so great ... especially when your baby young . my little one didn't like all " fancy " chairs lights such right away . she would cry or fidget them ... i think because they overstimulating . but i could always put her this chair ! it soft looks comfortable ( she always seems peaceful sitting it ) . it lay flat or inclined slightly so baby see things . i also like little head rest keep her head flopping all over place ... lot other chairs aren't " new baby " friendly . it also offers vibration music , which nice . now she bit older , she likes animals bar talks them . she still loves sleep it it nice comfy place her sit ( especially when i need bit break ) . i would recommend this any new mom ... it great chair your newborn !	1
