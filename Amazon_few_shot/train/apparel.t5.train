like last reviewer said it tricky put using little straps go around your bra ... fact . front closure bra might help some . even though i ( finally after lot cussing ) got straps around my bra , garment still gapped underneath bra both sides back strap , which right middle . only place back there strap hold whole back girdle up . then there one strap under each arm goes around your bra there . it pulled down my bra there causing scrunching . there one strap front middle too , which i don't need use . directions say attach spanx/straps bra ' step ' into garment . right !! much easier said than . it stay up properly back i think it needs straps not only right middle , but also left right middle , under arm ones . i can't really use mine ... waste money , i already removed tags can't send it back . i spanx same but without little straps i can't use either , it creep down back . unless you don't move . so altogether i spent $150 spanx stuff i can't use . there must better way fasten those straps .... maybe sturdy snaps or velcro or something , they should fasten right top edge garment , it they hook half inch down inside causes top edge tend roll out cause bulk there . not happy	-1
i found these shoes searching women option running shoes . name may say unisex , but there no indication sizing 100% male . not even note stating woman should subtract 2 or 3 or 10 sizes her normal shoe size . when shoes arrived here , they huge . i tried return them , but amazon considers this my fault , planned charge back any shipping , promotions coupons against possible refund . i very well using coupon , sale , " buy $80 worth shoes get $20 off instantly " promotion amazon prime , so my " refund " would less than nothing . that right -- if i return shoes , i owe money . because amazon made no mention shoes found women section site might men shoes instead . yeah , seems fair	-1

( old 6.7 oz ) . ones i am returning less substantial - especially if you stretch them see through them which you can't my old ones . next , it seems they also extended inseam length . it 32 inches old sport knit pants before washing - 31.5 after . ones i received after washed inseams measuring nearly 33 inches . finally , if i wasn't feeling self conscious enough my bod , pants narrowed hips thighs . you get picture ? waist sags rolls . seat major baggy . my belly button shows . they stretch across my hips so there those stupid horizontal lines where they pull crotch . they sucked tight my thighs , then ballon out my knees feet . they're too long , so you can't even see my feet . i spent 30 minutes phone " specialist " land end she couldn't explain why all changes . that also where i got all above new specs . also , spoke specialist ll bean their new specs identical . i spend so much each year land end i get gift card chrismas them . so , i'm not casual purchaser their product . buyer beware get new specs before you buy product you think you know rely . you " . if you land end or ll bean customer - call them complain . they've this past , then bring back " old " version . so , it wasn't broke land end always sold out or back ordered their sport knit pants ) so whose dim-bulb idea it " fix " them ????	-1

ok , i don't why this bra available any size larger than cup , because it just not provide needed support women larger bust ( i see available here 38 dd , i shudder think anyone built thusly wearing this flimsy thing ) . it comfortable enough worn around house , under jammies , little support when just relaxing , but if you looking something hold you place through day , this bra won't it . front closure just doesn't allow any lift or support . unless you possess smaller chest , skip this one	-1

i received my new shoes this afternoon took test run . i didn't really buy this a3 its " functionality " but rather look . i thought honey comb color combination look kinda cool . however , i not all feel " propelled through every foot " , so called a3 cushion heels felt very stiff . i even poked it my hand , oh man it hard . i also tried jumping up down try feel bounciness , but all i feel my feet stomping hard onto cement . btw , if your feet wide flat like mine , it going very uncomfortable when walking these shoes . *** update *** november 15 , 2006it 2 months since i've wearing these shoes , i've changed my opinion them . once you get use a3 sequence , they actually quite comfortable . honeycombs under heels make every step little bouncier now . maybe it takes time soften up material make them more flexible	-1

this classic style work boot which used lot more common than now , even appearing one episode " leave it beaver " late ' 50s , cover one simon garfunkles albums late ' 60s . i've owned several pair similar boots other makers , including red wing . some comments which apply this style general , ( not just wolverines ): pros - wedge sole absorbs lot shock making them great standing/working concrete , or walking long distances hard surfaces . also , non-agressive tread means dirt grass doesn't track into house after doing chores outside . moc toe tends breath through seams , so feet tend stay cooler drier hot , dry conditions . great boot desert , apparantly highly esteemed many construction workers . cons - wedge sole doesn't offer much traction serious hiking steep , loose surfaces ( which i've used them , but which they really weren't intended ) . gravel roll right out under them . none several brands i owned water-resistant all . walking through wet grass lead wet socks very quickly , seams around toe which allow air perspiration escape also allow outside moisture enter just easily . we used say " your feet get wet two days before it rains " . so , perhaps not best choice hiking pacific northwest . specifically , wolverines extemely comfortable right out box . they better insole than any my previous boots this style , removeable polyurethane contoured cushion which provides good arch support . color actually more brown clay , rather than what i would call tan . quality workmanship appeared pretty good , actually better looking stitching than my red wings . however i disappointed variable nature leather . leather most boot appeared adequately thick , however leather used shaft around ankles thinner than i ever seen any work boot , thinner even than many suede sneakers . while my ankles covered , they didn't feel all supported or protected . after considering couple days , i decided return boots merchant who provided them amazon , sportsmans guide . they provided return shipping label box , so i taped box closed , applied label , took it post office . i received email few days later acknowledging their receipt package , notice credit applied my account . so , while i'm not very excited particular pair boots which i received , i give good marks sportsmans guide quick relatively painless return . i ended up purchasing georgia spr 6 " farm ranch boot , wedge sole , also available through amazon . further details , please see my review	-1

i these black , while i find them go just every outfit i wear work , i wish they just little ( read : quite lot ) less uncomfortable . firstly , insole provided doesn't seem fit inside shoe properly . almost like it too wide . my foot neither narrow nor wide , so this isn't something i typically notice shoe . there arch , but because weirdly shaped insole it doesn't provide any support . zig zap strap really cute feature i love , but it just adds uncomfort shoe . you tighten strap keep your foot sliding around inside , but then it cuts off circulation leaves painful imprints . if you leave it too loose then you leave your feet pretty unstable . all all , versatile mary jane good looks but no comfort	-1

we purchased these boots my husband who works construction field(mainly insulation instalation ) which requires him climb high places , walk trusses , also under floors sometimes standing water other harsh weather conditions . my opinion these boots not " heavy duty " rubber soles all but cheap soles start rub crumble almost immediately under working conditions . there also no arch or foot support inside boot itself . there piece leather saying " made china " that it . tag even reccomends getting some sort insole . worst part tag boot it states you should get next size up than what your normal boot size . seller not state this fact . all all , if you purchasing these boots long term wear or work related activities i not reccomend them . if they teenager making fashion statement or halloween costume they're perfect	-1

i am great shape . however , i cannot get over so many men underwear products waist bands constrict exasperarate blood flow muscle tension . obviously they made china where average waist 25 inches . idea " medium " marketed ridiculous healthy american standards . my body fat low . i am not profoundly muscular bound . common men my age , lower back problems not unusual . i 32 " waist . not " medium " sized ? i think we simply need get rid elastic waist band altogether . one size fits all doesn't work it dangerous those many us fight our lower back problems . draw string fine . it allows flexibility . so what if your pants fall down ? it seems fashion , anyway . just give us option pulling shorts back up instead pinching nerves static elastic waist band causes ridiculous lower back problems because unnecessary , uncontrollable constrictions . also , these boxers don't hold up well any kind washing . they looked like crap after first time i washed them . i wish i could get refund because i won't wear them again . my life partner told me they looked like " old men " underwear . sad embarrassing because i agree they looked like crap after one cold wash light dry . i am not mean hearted kind guy . so , i am going shut my mouth now not business you again .	-1
it awful . size too big me ( my waistline 34 sizing chart it says " size fits 26-36 " )so i end up cut it sew it back so it fit me . then after 3 days wearing it , velcro messed up , it not attached together anymore . costumer service answering machine ( i tried several times call costumer service , only get machine answer my call ) . i not return item , because it says its illegal return this kind item . so my advise , dont buy this item or you'll sorry .	-1

i looking good nursing nightgown wear while hospital after giving birth my second child . i seen aimee gown before , i really liked looks it , reviews seemed great . after purchasing gown ( shipped via fed ex canada , which means i got dinged fedex " customs broker " costs ... ) i tried it while 8 months pregnant see how it fits . i purchased size xl i am around sz 14 pre-pregnancy . i normal bust size 36d . gown itself made nice heavyweight cotton lots stretch recovery ( doesn't just stretch out stay there ) , crossover top really nice becuase it crosses over easy pull aside nursing , but isn't too deep ( nobody needs see * * much my clavicle ) . there slit up side ease walking , but it very high slit , too high , i felt . gown didn't fit well over my pregnant belly - but i don't fault them , it not advertised fitting during pregnancy . however , after giving birth , i still don't think it would fit well first couple weeks , until baby belly subsides bit . gown stretches well enough fit over slowly-declining bump , but unfortunately , you walk around , elastic contracts gown back up over your bump , pulling slit side higher higher up your leg . gown itself long enough more than cover your bump it retracts , but it not comfortable feeling when slit creeps higher higher . bustline great when i'm nursing - easy pull over , great coverage other side . it fits well under bust ( elasticised under cups ) but i found cups huge my breasts . it fit well band , but i guess they figure if you're big girl , you must big boobs . luckily , i'm handy sewing , so i plan take gown up shoulders fix this . overall , i think this great gown wear around house while breastfeeding .... after baby belly subsided . i plan bring it hospital me , but only after i've taken seams shoudlers , closed side slit bit	-1

this tee-shirt my first under armour purchase , i took chance ordering it without ever trying any under armour before . i'm not dissatisfied , but it isn't my favorite tee-shirt . positive side : weight fabric good exercising , especially gym , it would good single layer outside/warm temperatures . fit pretty good ( i am average sized wear sizes 8-10 ); i don't like really tight clothing this shirt loose enough comfortable but fitted enough so it doesn't look like i'm wearing bag . negative side : i am little short-waisted , shirt long me bunches top my hips , which i don't like but accept . also , vee-neck not very strong vee ( pictures this shirt true respect ) . lot technical tees like this -- designed more function than style maybe -- vee-necks essentially crew vee hybrid . i prefer true vee-neck . lastly , fabric slightly rough , scratchy feel , which seems characteristic today technical fabrics . it not clear me cost " hand " worth added function " wicking " this instance . overall , i consider this shirt fine gym or hour-long run , but i wouldn't want spend lot extended time it .	-1

this product every breastfeeding mother needs know . finally solution leaking way sleep without wearing bra ! i've using lilypadz month now i must say i love them . when i started breastfeeding my daughter i using traditional round cotton pads you put inside your bra soak up leaks . i hated them because they look terrible under snug fitting shirt , they don't always absorb all liquid , they shift out position leaving you no protection all . i assumed it just necessary evil breastfeeding because i didn't know something wonderful lilypadz existed ! i admit , when i first saw them advertised i skeptical . i didn't think they would stick , i didn't think they would stay place , i thought sure if they stick it would hurt take them off or they'd leave tacky residue my breast . i hestitated couple weeks , wanting try them , but afraid i'd spend all money end up disappointed . it one morning after waking up soaked because one my cotton pads slipped during night i decided i would risk it order them . when they arrived i read all instructions ready try them out . now this embarrassing part ... instructions it specifically says take them off plastic dome before using . some reason i thought they meant take them out plastic container . i didn't realize each lilypad also stuck piece plastic ! when i first tried put them i actually tried flipping entire pad plastic dome inside out . ( yes it tough too !! ) i frustrated because they obviously didn't stick . i began think my fear them not working true . once i realized my stupid mistake , i peeled them off plastic tried again . they stuck perfectly !! try avoid problem i .. make sure you peel each them off their little plastic domes . i immediately surprised how secure they felt . i knew right away i would able wear them bed not worry one falling off . my next fear removing them . i carefully lifted up edge peeled one off . i surprised even though they stuck securely , they peeled off ease without causing pain my tender breasts . i estatic ! what great product !! i found after using them month there pros cons . however pros greatly outweigh cons . this what i found ... pros ------ 1 ) attaches securely2 ) removes very little or no pain3 ) no residue left behind breast . baby eat soon pad removed . 4 ) protects tender breasts rubbing against clothing or sticking cotton pads . ( if you feeling sore these huge help . ) 5 ) secure enough stay all night long without wearing bra . 6 ) washable reusable7 ) invisible under snug fitting shirts . 8 ) when properly applied you not leak9 ) peace mind 10 ) quick drying . after cleaning them give them good shake you ready reapply them ( even if they bit damp still ) . no need buy more than one pair unless you need peace mind back up . one pair work always ready use . cons ------- 1 ) if not properly applied you might leak . you must careful avoid air bubbles make sure you apply strong pressure nipple when putting them . however , even if you leak - it won't get your clothes . instead it pools up around nipple . it usually stays sealed . you just sure remove pad , drain liquid , rinse them then reapply properly . one warning , if you air bubble you leak lot it possible pad loosen pop off spilling milk you . this only happened me maybe twice after long night leaking while sleeping . i leaked during night , woke up feeding baby one side without checking see if i leaked other . my milk let down filling air bubble more pad popped off drenching me . 2 ) if you own cats/dogs ... keep them away pads when you aren't wearing them . they attract fur like crazy . if they get furry its ok because it wash off . its just pain butt takes little extra effort3 ) takes little more effort reapply pad public ( vs shoving cotton pad back your bra ) but once you get hang it , it woudn't even make con list anymore . 4 ) i personally don't wear them every day . i'm one those types thinks skin should chance breathe little . i wear them every night , but during day i'll occasionally wear my cotton pads so my skin breathe . i'm afraid i'll end up thrush or just pruney nipples if i wore them 24/7 . i no evidence back up claim - they may work just fine 24/7 . i'd say i wear them 3-4 times week during day . i not go night without wearing them though because i hate wearing bra bed . you see pros outweigh cons quite bit . cons shouldn't enough keep you trying them yourself . even if you plan wearing them only night they well worth cost . if you like me you skeptical - don't . these really work you glad you gave them try . every breastfeeding mother should own pair i think they would make wonderful unique baby shower gift !	1

these most comfortable things i ever worn my feet ; i bought them halloween i'm so happy i ; they my new house shoes . but just case you didn't know : straps only attached back slipper ; so you sew them into front- i'm assuming proper fit ; this bit annoying- coupled fact there no loop or area fabric sew them into without see your handy work through front(no good if your terrible sewing like me ); they soil easily ; this should expected course(especially if they white ) . still , my title suggests , they earn 5 stars more because they truly comfortable ; especially if your house carpeted ; i can't well explain why , because shoes really no padding ; but they hug your feet support your arch extent ( i'm assuming these would not comfortable flat footed people ) . price great , if you into ballet , what you loose	1

i saw these shoes macy yesterday $36 . they only red . imo , red bright , clown red . it not bad red , it just true red no subtlety . i almost considered getting them , but i reminded myself i hunt black patent , pointy toe skimmer . i am * so * glad macy not black because i got them thru amazon $22 . i believe shoe fits true size . i am 7.5 , period . pointy shoes , i sometimes go 8 or avoid pointys altogether . i going listen reviews here order 8 , but i tried 8 macy it too big . i think it bit stretched it given it floor model , but i figured even brand new size 8 would too big . i ordered recvd 7.5 . when i recvd shoes today put them they snug . not snug tight or uncomfortable way . they just fit exactly my foot . this leather upper not man made . so patent looks black shiny ! it not cheap looking all . point comes nice triangle isn't exagerrated . given they leather , i expect them stretch little my feet . shoes measures 10.5 " point middle heel . point top shoe 3 " there 1 " my big toe point . there comfortable room move toes because shoe leather , it form bit feet you wear them . i experienced already just walking around house . shoe looks low cut sides , but my foot stays completely shoe when i am walking . i'll watching see if i end up line/bend across front shoe . time happens -- if it ever -- i certainly gotten my $22 out them . finally , i am 5'2 " i tend avoid pointy toe shoes because it sometimes looks like i am wearing skis . these shoes great because they elongate my leg don't create costume-y look . they look great peeking out jeans i i expect them look good w/the new capri leggings i got other day . highly recommended !	1

these feel great look great , if that all you're wearing . if you wear you pants so high you can't see them , then you really don't need them . if you like really low pants , then you still flash inch or so underwear before your pants really too low . best part , when your pants slipped too low , you pull them back up without underwear bunching up .	1

i thought i getting bargain - rockports discount ! when they arrived , craftsmanship finish impressed me . stitching looked even shine appropriate dress wear . they comfortable enough ( maybe little snug ) , but i though it odd they creased across ( rather than rear ) cap . within few days , however , skin-like coating ( perhaps waterproof layer ? ) uppers separated underlying leather , creating blisters creases . within few weeks , those blisters tore , exposing leather underneath . i'm not sure where this end , but less than 2 months old , they soon look too bad dress wear . , i suspect waterproofing now compromised . i'm glad i didn't pay full price !	-1

after reading quite few negative reviews this bag , i thought i would write review clarify something . this messenger bag , not backpack . messenger bag never meant hold all items backpack . so basically , if you're using this bag school purposes , keep this mind . this bag hold items possibly up 3 classes . so while it perfect college student who might class , then class right after it . this bag would horrible high school student , who might drag home texts six classes . most messenger bags , elefunk bag probably going your best choice , cause its size number compartments . we 3 these bags , 2 which used education , third used utility/diaper family bag . education , i stated before , it best college students . main compartment spans out hold 2 college texts , binders , study guides snug . keyword there snug , cause it not big enough carry more . inside main compartment little sleeve held tight velcro patch . i use this keep my study guides my texts . okay , next comes front pocket attached main compartment . this compartment big enough fit my 12 inch ibook neopreen cover , or 13 inch macbook bare . warning , if you place your macbook this pouch , careful how you toss this bag around , cause it offers no padding very unforgiving . inside this front pouch zippered sleeve fine putting loose change or maybe id cards or what not . next zippered sleeve two pouches pens pencils , even ti calculator , if you're not planning putting your notebook pouch . don't worry though , cause attached pouch outside two zippered compartments opposite one front pouch . one side i put my black leather data file , other side , i put my ti-89 calculator . then leaves flap , which secured bag using strong plastic clips . front pouch zippered compartment . which i pretty much only use it pack up couple magazines read , if i'm waiting classes . you also use it pack up headphones or earbuds , listen you ipod or whatever . shoulder strap , it comfy it going get . keep mind , you're lugging 20 30 pounds books supplies , it not suppose feel like chinese massage . but i can't complain . family bag . eh , i wouldn't suggest this newly mother who wants go down mall . cause stores not let your take this bag there . but if you're trip , or going flight , this bag excellent . you pack away all your babies needs , other essentials . anyway , i just didn't like seeing product i use , like , getting knocked , cause couple people misjudged how use it properly . again , if you're taking more than 2 or 3 classes time , this bag isn't you . but if you're run mill college student , who takes class or two time , then goes home . this bag must	1

i travel lot ! i would recommend this everyone . it extremely compact convenient . it helps " know " ahead time what your luggage weighs avoid switching swapping items bag bag and/or paying extra fees overweight luggage- not mention holding up line . : -	1
theoretically speaking , this seems handy little doo-dad/gizmo/thingamabob well-organized/obsessive-compulsive traveler , but please take note following pros cons . pros : 1 . it gives you fairly accurate preview weight your luggage (+/- few ounces ) saving you irritation arriving airline counter over-heavy luggage , repack shuffle potentially embarrassing items around full view other passengers . 2 . you use tape measure verify your carry-on luggage fit overhead compartment , or under seat . this saves you participating dreaded ruthless shoving tournament skies , where people try stuff bags size newborn elephants into overhead lockers . cons : 1 . it capacity weigh suitcases up 75 lbs , but when you're traveling alone , it very awkward lift suitcase even half weight your arms extended ( so it doesn't touch your body ) still read tiny numbers dial . 2 . handle small " ergonometrically-challenged " , people who can't lift 50 lb suitcase one outstretched hand find it very difficult get two hands there . even if you manage get this far , you won't able hold it long before handle sinks deep into your palm , cutting you new lifeline . 3 . you need try balance suitcase centering hook suitcase handle , but if you lift too quickly , hook slips one side , causing possible grievous bodily harm suitcase comes down your toe . 4 . hook problem - you see hook open design . if you lifting suitcase , hook slip off way up , causing suitcase fall 3 . above . even worse , momentum keeps your hand moving upwards , not only you give yourself shiner or broken nose back your hand , but hook swing up jab you eye . ( true story)you use it lighter luggage without too many problems , but then again , if your luggage light you no need fear scale - you ? surface this sounds like great travel gadget , but beware pitfalls . amanda richards , september 22 , 200	-1

i love look feel this bra . it not classic compression bra , but encapsulation -- it separate cups . addition , it not made all cotton , but special moisture wicking material , very comfortable . i purchased this bra three times , it perfect when i 34b -- provided plenty support i loved how it thick enough i never showed through my tank top when exercising , but now i am 34d , i don't think this bra provides enough support when i am doing high impact activities like running or kickboxing . low medium activities this sports perfect still . but since i taken up more rigorous activities , i bought panache bra ( make sure buy your exact size panache )	-1
love them !!! exactly pictured !!!! got two pairs ... one gold one silver	1

well constructed , well padded case your small digital camera . i like it ample storage pocket extra batteries sd cards , i like easy-open u-shaped zippers . no corners negotiate , no top cover flip up hold out way while you butterfinger your camera out case . pretty weatherproof shockproof , too . it provides great protection your camera . i got little carried away kept usb cable my camera accessory pocket two extra batteries media card . this actually worked several months (!) before i broke zipper . i could bought differently designed replacement case locally -- there dozens dozens them -- but none anything like suited my needs tastes this little caselogic . so i ordered one amazon exactly like one i ruined . if there anything i'd change case , it would add small hand strap . but that not issue me . if i want carry it my hand , i just slip finger through belt look carry it way . i've learned my lesson storing usb cable accessory pocket . so i'm expecting replacement easily outlast my camera	1

i researched this thouroughly before buying . i wanted nice looking case would protect entrie thing little extra space added my ipod . this case all . i got red ( blaze ) color , i love it . it even feels good touch . i cut out space hold switch area around headphone port , but i don't see any sort problem . i just got my ipod today already dropped it , but i feel safe secure knowing i my evo3 case my beautiful ipod . definitely worth price	1
previously , i owned leather flip-face cover my ipod video it worked fine while , but flexible screen cover became " loose " began scratch screen . this product exactly what described . " iskin evo3 athletic protective case " hard plastic see through cover fits over entire front ipod . silicon cover soft ( sticky so it prevents sliding - especially if you remove clip ) easy put . case covers whole ipod except headphone jack " flap " fits over ( into ) connection bottom . you use click wheel slide top through silicon . it also looks pretty good . only thing takes some getting used silicon over click wheel . it , like click wheel when i first got ipod , takes some getting used . it pretty thin tends buckle if you push hard . ( don't worry , though . it fixes itself when you pick up your finger . ) if you're looking good quality , semi cool looking , funcional cover , this pretty good choice . either way , enjoy share your music whenever you !!	-1

briefly , i childhood accident 30+ years ago caused arthritis my foot . not bad , but constant , nagging pain sensation i learned just live . finally , i saw podiatrist who referred me pedorthist fitted footwear could alleviate my pain . i wound up pair birkenstock sandals i've never turned back . they're great . no more foot pain , period . i wear dress socks sandals work everyday ( office environment -- i got flack co-workers , but needling didn't bother me management never took me task , either ) , church , everywhere . i've different pair birkies beach lawn work -- not comfortable suede uppers these arizona . mocha suede straps held up wonderfully despite getting wet lightly soiled time time . admittedly , it lot money spend , but shoe store my pedorthist works re-soles birkies $30 , replace cork sole both $50 . re-soled sandals last year , but remember , i wear them daily i often walk few miles each day . short , these sandals dramatically improved quality my life foot arthritis no longer any concern me . not bad little more than $100	1

i bought these socks strength other reviews . i won't repeat what these reviewers said except say i agree they best white socks you get . however , i add some additional information they not necessarily mention . these socks obviously well made fairly thick . however , they not too thick which concern i . they much thicker softer than gold toes cotton crew socks , but you must also pay this i.e. $9.00 vs . $15.00 . other hand , i estimate these socks stand up laundering better , last much longer stay up repeated washing . exact composition these socks : 84% combed cotton , 15% stretch nylon 1% spandex . less expensive socks i reference above 82% combed cotton , 17% stretch nylon 1% spandex . one would think this wouldn't make much difference terms durability , but there seems more weight material overall higher quality socks . i also some experience white cotton crew socks while they absorbent because high cotton content , i don't feel they held up repeated washing well . i also don't think they much better than less expensively priced socks other manufacturers . however , white fluffies quantum leap up worth extra money	1

size mesh this quite good since it still very much fishnet , but woven tightly enough so it doesn't tear easily . method used keep fishnet ' down ' ( towards your hand ) single clothen loop goes around your middle finger , if you keep fishnet pulled down far enough this fine comfortable , but if you allow ' bottom ' lower part fishnet , near heal your hand , slip upward your wrist , this pull loop likely leave deep mark your finger 10-15 minutes after taking off fishnets . overall pretty good product what it says it , well worth price , these pretty decent quality	-1

i just love birkenstock boston clogs . i've owned them black leather , dark gray suede , bright yellow suede . ( last these turned some heads , but they cool enough -- situation where some rough characters afoot -- nobody bothered me . ) they awesomely comfortable . my tour guide israel stupefied them when i demonstrated following : flex your knee , raising your calf until parallel ground , keeping your foot perpendicular ground , -- even without clench your toes -- clog not fall off . eytan watched spellbound i this over over . secret ? you'll notice your foot gets slightly wider behind metatarsal heads then narrows again both directions ( phalangead calcad , podiatrists might say ) . boston so expertly crafted -- so balanced anatomically perfect foo t--t hat material stretch just wide enough admit those protuberant metatarsal heads , then spring back just tight enough hold them place . it fun mesmerizing eytan : he so arrogant	1

i got 30 30 my son , they fit just right . i think they're bit baggier butt than 501 , though . they well made should last quite while . color regular stone-wash , not dark it states , somewhat lighter than color your screen . we prefer dark denim , but price , you can't beat it .	-1
i bit skeptical first these levi first . long time 505 guy , i thought their must lower line jeans levi they releasing big chain stores , saving their regular levi name department stores . well , finally i broke down look pair these jeans when i say they sale . i astonished , they exactly same jean , average $10 less . look closely , stitching same , even position inside labels . buttons rivits same well . main difference back pockets don't little red levi tag , " " shaped decorative detail stich . otherwise these same jeans . they fit just well , i think even better , but may because my wallet bit fuller fit after buying these . after 15 years 505 , i found new favorite . seriously , check these out , you wont dissapointed . even better , they kids line , so your growing kids you get same levi quality less , nice when they grow out jeans so fast . if you worried where they manufactured , i tell you last 20 pairs levi i made either mexico , columbia , or somewhere asia , so these made egypt not big deal , least they grow cotton their . note : button fly 501 people , they not line signature button flys , so you stick regular levi . probably smart marketing move , but these genes suprised me , levi may suprise again	1
they look better person , arevery comfortable . service grea	1
i love these shoes . these real tennis shoes , made tennis . means lightweight , durable , good walking . they're beautiful little things . many people not know full history these italian leather babies , but those who know upper echelon . ellesse name based initials , l.s. , its founder , leonardo servadio , italian tailor innovative approach styling manufacture . 1959 , servadio created revolutionary stretch ski pant which established ellesse among elite alpine social circles , making it ultimate aspirational brand . immense success ellesse winter sports clothing provided perfect passport expand brand transfer design philosophy into equally prestigious world tennis . 1976 , servadio seized opportunity take brand onto worldwide stage embarked aggressive sponsorship programme signing tennis legends such boris becker , chris evert lloyd guillermo vilas . ellesse became synonymous tennis skiing testimony success ellesse these highly competitive fields , ellesse logo , consisting half tennis ball combined 2 ski tips , surmounting company name , created . i must also warn there few pairs this particular line minor defect , which there one shoe where sole comes loose . this fixed little rubber cement , but if you don't want bothered , just send it back it easily exchanged , shipping costs reimbursed back you . even small hassle , you can't beat sharply reduced price featured here ! my favorite pick white/tan/brown . just sure keep laces clean	1

well $99 i thought this would good running shoe . so far it seemed okay maybe takes while break cause i haven't felt bounce yet . when i received my shoes i noticed hole bottom sides shoe thought this not good idea . but then i figured if it rains insoles , my weight , would block any water getting shoe . well i wrong . it rained road muddy so now good pair white socks trashed . wet mud came through all holes shoe including insoles which also holes them . shoes covered mud now so i don't think i send them back .	-1
i bought this swimsuit because current style baggy surfer shorts extremely uncomfortable swimming laps ( ok , i admit i also inspired bond movie , casino royale ) . but i didn't want go all out get those tiny suits olympic swimmers europeans wear so this nice compromise . remember it snug , tight suit so if you normally wear medium pair surfing trunks , you'll want large size here cause it feel uncomfortably tight make you feel very self-conscious when you step out changing room . material very good . it stretches well , dries quickly . elastic waistband , however , not attached so everytime you take off suit , waistband elastic gets all twisted around . it not difficulat manually twist ' em back into shape -- but it still annoying . because it so snug , there no pockets any kind no place put your locker key . overall , it good product . but you better not self-conscious your body -- this man equivalent thong bikini ( considering how modest men -- least american men's-- swimwear become ) . i felt very self-conscious first but since i only wore them gym swim laps , i didn't care so much how i looked i really appreciated fact this comfortable swim . but now , after year dedicated working out , i'm starting look good these swimtrunks really accentuate broad shoulders tight abs . i even wear them around house cause it drives my wife nuts ( good way ) . now james bond wore something like these casino royale , it won't too weird me wear this beach this summer	-1

my husband prefered 100% nylon socks since he wearing suits work . among 100% nylon sock , he prefers gold toe brand . i can't tell why because i haven't asked , but i assume they everything he wants over-the-calf sock because he hasn't looked elsewhere . he buying them joseph banks , but they stopped carrying 100% nylon , he didn't like mixed fibers . he asked me find them , i went straight amazon	1

best swim suit i ever seen usi strongly believe this best speedo suits i ever bought this country . swim suites made very soft elastic fabric , it not cause itchiness your waste , hips , crotch , which usually happens when you put small speedos like this . suits actually only one inch cloth sides , you may move your legs water very easily , it makes your swim performance far better than other speedos . good feature this suit there many variation color . i own white , black dark blue one . i personally not recommend one white very light color , since it become absolutely see-through when wet . i know there one big concern when men wearing this suite . here my comment someone who not confidence wear them swimming pool : frank , my friends told me suits little revealing since those high-leg cut made thin fabric . fact , even darker colors , shape your " manhood " somewhat revealed especially when wet these suits . ( but not see-through ) however , don't you think it always happens when you any speedos long you " organ ? " it absolutely more strange if part completely flat . addition , any swimming suits more or less this feature . if you person who thinks unfavorable , you may want stop swimming pool other work outs . other words , people might see you package occasionally since it high leg cut adhere your body . however who cares , stares , makes fun it all time when you swimming pool ? suites cover only essential part because it made swim fast , but absolutely not reveal your manhood pull attention others . don't you agree ? i recommend you try it least once if you swimmers who seriously want swim fast . price around $20 , it affordable second swim ware . i realized actual size waist this suite might little bigger than jeans or pants . therefore , you feel more comfortable if you buy one size smaller . like myself , i usually ware jeans or pants size 29 . therefore i chose 28 perfectly fit me . fabric elastic , it stretches bit . however , if you worry size , just buy exact size . i love this suit ware it all least once week . other people wrote previously , color fades relatively fast pool water . therefore , i would suggest you buy two pairs wear it turns .	1
i didn't know if i would happy ordering this item through amazon but it ok . just like buying it store .	1

i bought these shirts ( black , medium ) wear daily basis , i am disappointed . first off , they don't fit like old ck crew necks ... they , fact , shorter waist wider . length isn't bad- it waist width too large makes shirt ill-fitting . ( i average body-type ) after just few washings , some stitching started coming undone , there loose strands inner parts shirts . i'm continually trimming these loose ends . although didn't affect way these shirts fit , i would expect better stitching ck . i wear shirts under sweaters or jackets , but i feel awkward wearing them their own outerwear due fit . i don't recommend these shirts . i'd rather pay more american apparel or banana republic	-1

i received money clip which advertised really nice box . money clip less than what described display box damaged huge nick top . i returned money clip company assured me they would send replacement not damaged . second replacement item just bad , if not , worse than first . company simply packages their items " padded envelope " which , obviously , doesn't protect items damage . never buy them again suggest amazon customers not use company either	-1

huuricane wash light blue , quite soft " slubby " lightweight denim . but nice comfortable well-broken . while much negative commentary concerning levi strauss move away domestic manufacturing focused button-fly 501s , bigger problem i seen old 1970 standby , 505 , which zipper opposed button fly . variability sizing sew quality 505s issue if you going buy them online or mail order . 501 easier buy online or mail order because sizing much less critical waist , which so-called " anti-fit " waist , meaning there no curve rise ( distance crotch top waist ) , because original 501s merely cut down bib overalls which made hang , rather than fitted waist . biggest problem i noted 505 variability size thigh area , meaning some fit baggy some seem rather tight , even though they theoretically same size label . 501s pretty safe far sizing .	1

i entitled review " cautiously optimistic " because relatively short period time i worn this garment i am still reserving bit judgement regarding its durability . stated , i very impressed support this bra . larger-than-average chest size ( bra i purchased " " cup ) i become accustomed purchasing bras which offer support initially only , if you'll pardon pun , let me down within week or so wearing them . " tisha " offered solid support . this bra hiked my bosom up kept it up all day . i not experienced any sagging or shifting garment . i mentioned support excellent , it even passed " jiggle test " . if i hurry somewhere or , heaven forbid , break into jog " girls " stay where they ought offering no threat injury me or any innocent passer-by . side supports , no doubt part reason bra effectiveness but they pinch bit . short , it feels good take bra off end day . i not however fantasize slipping out it lunchtime ease aching shoulders or alleviate pain i some others . bra , quite naturally , very personal garment therefore difficult recommend but i recommend this bra large-busted women . i would happily trade scores $30-$40 dollar " mistakes " this style .	-1

while much negative commentary concerned levi strauss move away domestic manufacturing focused button-fly 501s , bigger problem i seen old 1970 standby , 505 , which zipper opposed button fly . variability sizing sew quality 505s issue if you going buy them online or mail order . you really try them see how they fit . 501 much easier buy online or mail order because sizing much less critical waist , which so-called " anti-fit " waist , meaning there no curve rise ( distance crotch top waist ) , because original 501s merely cut down bib overalls which made hang , rather than fitted waist . biggest problem i noted 505 variability size thigh area , meaning some fit baggy some seem rather tight , even though they theoretically same size label . since 501s more forgiving far sizing , if you buying online you might consider them instead 505s , unless you don't want button fly .	1

cost -- i thought -- might well try this gadget--there no real large financial investment , so if it looks or behaves goofy , i'll just toss it trash . so , my husband buttons one end tiedown , slides tiedown through necktie nametag ( shorter necktie end tucked also ) buttons tiedown other end . i would've bet money fact you could see edges this ' cheap ' tie holder or tie just wouldn't lie right . well , i right . tie crumpled all up looked goofy -- until we moved tiedown down one button . then i my husband stand up straight , lean forward , lean side side ......... omg .... i could not see tiedown all , tie completely well-behaved ! we thrilled this new gadget ! hubby worn it week -- not heard one comment colleagues ' unusual ' tie holder . because no one see it ! i one suggestion though -- they should sold packs three or five -- way if one gets broken kids , chewed up dog , or lost dear hubby , then you'll extras hand . so , meantime , few when you order ! ( i didn't realize time this review multi-pack available ) . this product eventually sold high quality retail shops -- get them while they're still so cheap , because once designers get hold them , they'll crank price up so high you'll think you're buying slice gold instead plastic !! trust me , i'm stocking up now ! buy ' em . you'll love ' em	1

old standby suddenly wet and/or chilly windy ride wear garbage bag . it works but you would really rather wearing jacket zipped unzipped . decent cycling jacket costs $150 more or less , but if you're novice you don't need blow kind cash , this jacket serve you fine . keep it you just case , see envy others faces they shiver their lycra or suffer sauna conditions wearing garbage bag keep dry because they didn't carry this handy bit easily fits jersey pocket or any kind backpack without too much bulk . keeping wind out alone big way keep warm foul conditions , while continuous riding produce more than enough heat keep you warm most time . if you're heading out , say , nyc five borough bike tour may , don't know what buy , your basics : some kind jersey -- coolmax shirt ; 6 panel or more cycling shorts chamois ( pad ) where sun don't shine ; light / thin socks ( air-e-ators best ); one these jackets . these helmet you're set serious riding . skip bulky layers warmth . if you want bit insulation you may need , get $10 polarfleece vest bargain store , one these jackets . i take one star because it doesn't vented armpits , but second thought i probably shouldn't consideration price value ratio	-1
our family taking extended vacation i wanted surprise my wife travel robe - not too light nor flimsy , but not too bulky either since our bags already full , after vacation , we'd returning our home south . i shopped around locally houston area dept stores surprised i couldn't find decent quality robe . they all cheap poor quality . " needlessly marked-up " great quality robe , but price hundreds dollars range . i then looked online , really tempted buy generic robe ~ $65 price range , but i became leery when i found too many negative reviews complaining poor fabric quality . hence i decided spring luxury spa robe . you should note exterior smooth ( microfiber ) interior cotton terry . my wife really pleased its look quality continues use it regularly . i also bought some matching slippers , she likes those , too . delivery lightning fast ; i received it only 3 days after placing order .	1

this sleeveless tank ck one best i've tried - its soft cotton , stretches fit well comfortable cold warm seasons . stretching quality compensates slight shrinkage happens upon first wash . only downside i see durability- these tanks either lose stretch quality or shape after year or two washing . but who said underwear must last ever ? if you know better tank i would happy hear it . good tanks hard find just like good jeans	-1
we looking insulated bag large enough hold luncheon salads 1- 1.5 quart size plasticware container . this one largest coolers we found online still lunch size . since salad containers round , oblong shape cooler bag gets distorted but it still large enough salads fit . it other cute compartments , some chilled , some not , but my family doesn't use these day day basis . i think they give extra flexibility what carried , though . we ordered same bag 3 colors , one each person . they look if they very durable but we've only them couple months . only negative there not separate pouch ice pack . i hoped all compartments cooler , one would hold ice away chilled food , but not case . it not big deal . just keeps this pretty perfect	-1

wore boxers decade before switching bikinis . i love look comfort support . jockey elance bikinis first i bought , years later , they still what i wear most all . i've since bought many other styles ( boxers , boxer briefs , classic briefs , thongs , other bikini styles ) brands , but it pretty much exception rule when i wear anything but jockey elance . contrary what others said , they well made . i've number them years , they still hold up . i also think they really comfortable . also , someone said they knock off women underwear . jockey made men elance bikinis long before they made any underwear women . however , online you generally only get them black , grey , white , which ok , but not most fun . you get wider variety colors department stores . walmart sells them huge variety colors life brand . but lot better than these hanro cotton stretch brief , also sale amazon . they better made , more comfortable , but extremely pricey . you buy 4 packs these price one those .	1

these best scrubs i ever found . if i put stuff chest pocket , it falls out when i bend over . i'm male nurse , when i wear scrub top two front pockets base i feel like i'm wearing apron . if i put stuff back pocket scrub pants , i sit it . finally , i found my solution ... cargo pockets ! i deduct points because these pants i end up wearing so many pockets i tend forget where i put stuff . if i run , anything heavy cargo pockets annoyingly slaps me legs ( all scrubs loose-fitting my chicken legs ) . but then i gave those points back because " coolness " factor . let face it , cargo pockets make you look like you ready anything ( even if i learned how minimize amount stuff i needlessly carry around ) . like most scrubs , they're very comfortable . new sandwashed material very durable stain resistant . i've washed them many many times they still look like new . dickies great brand one i'll sticking ( unless carhartt starts making scrubs )	1

i am physical therapist . when i got pregnant , i concerned my back how it would hold up during pregnancy . hormone relaxin released pregnancy , our joints loosen up can't support much they non-pregnant state . this especially notable sacroiliac ( si ) joint our low backs . instability this joint ( there one each side ) lead pain . 18 weeks i started some si pain . i got one these belts relief within 24 hours . 2 months i wore it every day support my si joints . i found if i attached velcro strap front securely , but not tight , then used two side straps tighten up whole belt , i would get best relief . i certain two side straps even : seam where they meet back center my back . i would then pull them around same time attach them so fit snug , but not uncomfortable . after couple months , baby started getting so big i started wearing it more support my belly . i've gotten bigger bigger , i've pulled back part upward slightly , which continues provide si support but also helps hold up baby . when i take belt off i really notice difference . support amazing such simple belt ( wish i patent!)i'm due month . i no back pain since before i used belt i continue work exercise without problems	1
these very compfortable pair bikinis . form fitting soft , elastic just enough keep them , they everything you want pair undies , but they don't last . i've wearing bikini style more than decade these good economical alternative brand got me started , calvin kleins . calvins shangri la all others strive . but you got pay . you only get one pair calvins $15 here you get 3 hanes $11 . they almost identical feel , difference construction . hanes only single layer frontal sheild whereas most other bikinis double area up good reason . after year or so your buddy downstairs busy making himself little window who knows what could lead . door or hatch then he could bust out take over . i suppose cost vs . longevity calvins balance out . they cost 4x much but last 4x long . but our partners want us same pair undies more than 5 years ? maybe hanes better buy because you eventually replace them .	-1

i'm really looking forward getting impact level 4 i ordered same time this one , because level 2 fantastic . this sports bra offers support , style . i've worn it jogging three times it feels great . no bounce no pinching . it held up great washing machine dried really quickly . everything i've tried before this wonderful bra way too flimsy offered no support . years i've looking something would hold everything place while i ran few miles jogged up down few sets stairs . i think i'll get one each support level then i'll get one more each . it even adjustable hooks elastic band around chest , so you lose those lbs while wearing this great top , you'll able adjust it fit you you slim down . i'll never search high low again . i'll know exactly where turn whenever i need sports bra support my " needs " . thank you figleaves , you really great product . i hope enough women find these sports bras godsend we'll never wear ugly , cumbersome , pinching nightmares again	1

i love these shoes ... but i heck time finding pair fit . i debated buying pair online because reviews so mixed . then i saw them dillards better selection colors , same price ( no shipping fees ) . i wear size 9 must tried 5 pairs before i found 9 fit like glove . within selection i choosing , there variation within sizes ( some 9s half size too big , some just right ) . reviewer zappos said these shoes better molded your feet if you warm them up dryer minute or two then put them	-1
i love my regular crocs ( they my staple shoe summer ) but they're too informal workdays . my fiance got me this prima style holidays they quickly become my favorite shoes . they lightweight comfortable crocs , also breathable . yet they cute regular ballet flats . i'm going buy pair silver . other reviewers complaining poor fit -- i wouldn't buy these shoes online unless you tried them store first , but if you buy them try them home before going out so you return them if they don't fit . you can't expect every single shoe manufacturor adhere exact same dimensions .	1
this great skin treo 700 . i used this product four months , brand prior . others noted , it increase thickness somewhat ( but certainly no less than leather cases , etc ) . but " thickness " gains you considerable protection . i dropped my phone concrete several times nary scratch . i like design this unit it leaves keyboard exposed thus it easy type . function buttons under skin , but easy press .	1

negative reviews aside - mostly because they stray good common sense any semblance sense humor - this pretty eye-catching bracelet . it conversation starter , but mostly it way me say something myself rather innocuous way . i recently broke one given me friend . i wore it daily liked sentiment . if you can't enjoy life - why bother living it ? then again - if you aren't enjoying life , you really living ? " livewrong " doesn't take anything away good work many doing - nor it fall into category all pseudo-charities who jumping band wagon . it what it - funny idea probably given guy who came up it fairly good side income . good him . i replacing mine - well buying few friends . what amazing how few books review sections this long . perhaps two words simply easier most people digest opinion	1

bought these boots here amazon because fabulous bargain price , i not disapppointed . they look absolutely marvelous , so comfy , like wearing big , soft bedroom slipper . they very warm also waterproof , so they withstand most any kind weather . i almost always wear 8 boots , but these , 8 way too large . this boot run little roomy . so , i got 7.5 am very happy it . one caveat : these not lightweight boots . pair weighs little over 3 lbs . which slightly heavy side long walks , but i don't plan walking miles them . looks weather protection , they can't beat . picture , foot looks slimmer , but they wide-foot look mukluk style . still , cute fake fur tops make them very stylish . also , suede straps around boot looks only -- don't try tightening them . i've heard several cases where people tried tighten them they broke	1
i really like these boots- they're cute good quality , heel isn't too high . unfortunately they're way too big me . i usually wear 8 or 8.5 , there no 8 available , so i ordered 8.5 . they're too big i'm returning them . otherwise i would've very happy	-1

these shoes comfortable first moment i put them . there never break period . i normally wear 6.5 shoe , these felt little big when i first tried them . however , when i tried size 6 shoe , i knew too small . i ended up buying 6.5 . i just wasn't used shoe fits allows me enough toe room wiggle my toes . merrells great people who need little more room toebox , but who don't feet wide enough move wider shoe . these shoes not waterproof , so you need treat them if you plan hiking through wet weather . i recommend purchase insoles after you worn these shoes few months . insole they come rather thin doesn't offer whole lot support . overall , if given choice , i would happily buy these shoes again . i would also say they run true size most people .	1

this not your typical lunch bag , several reasons . this bag very large accomodating all your needs , male or female . it indeed very roomy i would classify it daybag or travelbag because it isn't limited most " lunchbags " , but still great days office . those you troubled coworkers " borrowing " your food drinks company refrigerator , your troubles over this bag . tons room include cooling packs keep least long day worth food drinks chilly . top bag seperate section hold all your other daily needs , whether it reading material , including full size magazines you won't roll up or fit , medications , keys , cell phone , pdas what you . other compartments accomodate you further . conveniently , there compartments where you keep things hidden , so personal items or valuables don't displayed any time , unless you choose so . this bag appears really well made , nothing cheap it or ill planned . zipper pulls alone tell story , large , heavy solid , accomodating smaller hand all way up very large men hands . stitching appears very well not prone come apart easily . dual handles top allow carrying one hand , or clip adjustable strap more hands free tote . thickness insulation more than adequate , much thicker than most off shelf type insualted bags , it what you would expect premium bag . fabric quality denier looks like it able hold up heavy use easy wipe clean , like most denier . i would not surprised see flight crew carrying this insulated tote , it style simple elegance you usually see their carryons , suitable even daybag phobic male , but sleek enough woman feel though she hasn't just joined brown bagger construction crew . this bag doesn't look out place office or worksite , beauty classic neutral design causual person or professional . it enough capacity work picnic bag several people . my mother eyeing it use carry all her copious amounts makeup her trip vegas , keeping all it cool mind . plot didn't succeed , it not yet seen vegas , but nice try mom , lol . sticker shock this bag may seem high if you used throw away bags mass retailers , but this worthwhile investment those needing quality more space . overall value very high more than worth money . hey , just what coworkers swipe month time might pay whole bag itself .	1

i 43 years hiking , backpacking peak bagging experience . recent years i migrated , like most people , all-leather european-style mountain boots lighter fabric/leather combination boots . they seemed work well while but two years ago i started experiencing significant pain my toes , instep heel . i concluded my lightweight boots well known outdoor supplier contributing factor , if not root problem because they didn't provide sufficient torsional ( side-to-side ) rigidity . danner advertisement " terra force " boot support system convinced me buy radical gtx two years ago . first thing i liked radicals roomy box toe area eliminated occasional rubbing problems caused my prior boots ' smaller toe box . there also plenty instep space my high arch . unlike many boots now come single width radical multiple widths allow wider fit ball foot while retaining snug heel fit prevents blisters . terra force torsional support not diminished after 250+ miles hiking . besides day hikes 2-3 day backpacks i've used radicals good results off-trail scrambles summits high sierra north cascades , occasionally crossing snow steep enough require ice axe . despite offering much more support than my prior lightweight boots radicals hardly heavier ( my size 10.5 -ee weigh 52 ounces ) . best all , after switching radicals my toe instep problems ceased almost immediately , my heel problems gradually diminished substantially , all which i attribute superior support terra force system . my opinion these boots too many seams different pieces leather fabric , but i'm not marking down my rating because that how virtually all lightweight , relatively inexpensive boots made these days	1
