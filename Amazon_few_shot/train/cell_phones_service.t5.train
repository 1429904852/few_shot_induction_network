i can't believe technology advanced it , samsung could produce this giant pos . it flashy , yes . but it deliver ?? no . i actually refused pay bill let them shut my service off . i loved clarity pictures , even though 1 megapixel camera pretty lousy , i even liked video feature . but phone only good if you use it !!! it years since i've such lousy reception phone . i'm considering taking dealer court over this , since they pushed it me told me what great phone it . i want my money back !!	-1

i bought these use my ipod earbuds . i old pair ( they green ) worked great , but i lost one . within minutes putting them earbuds , they split open - all three pairs ! if you're planning using these your ipod headphones , look into older colored ones - i believe they're different material less prone cracking	-1
i ear gels before , but none this cheap ( i don't mean cost ! ) . there no consistency size ( they come different sizes , but no two same ) . without fail , every single one i tried use split half after installed ear piece . every one ! it didn't seem matter if they small or larger -- or even larger than ear piece . material just began tearing both sides ended up falling off ever instance . i am sure there must better quality version these things somewhere . i seriously not recommend these anyone	-1

gel inserts jabra quite uncomfortable , least me . it bit hard make earbud stay my ear , forget jogging wearing this . also insert comes off very easily , if friend wants borrow it different size ears , you need find other sizes insert . sound quality mediocre , callees often complain wind noise my end . i'm not happy these	-1
i got this phone basically free , but even taking into account , i'm pretty disappointed phone . this my first samsung , i'm pretty sure , my last one ! i owned nokia before i regret i " betrayed " it . now i wouldn't get anything besides nokia worst case maybe sony-ericsson . so here short list those " little things " make your life , this phone ( it combination t-mobile ) , annoying : - keys not comfortable use . - it not really comfortable open/close slider make it easier you put your thumb screen which leaves greasy all time . - putting comma , while writing text message , capitalizes next word - what logic ?! ( it annoys me because i use text messages lot)- you can't set camera shutter silent ... - you only save 1 phone type each category - what if person 2 business phones ... - you cannot choose e-mail address person contact list when you want send picture message e-mail address . there lot more those little illogical things just not thought through , like it would've nokia ( even model 5 years old ! )oh yeah , t-mobile really " contributed " " greatness " this phone , removing some features limiting others , like setting your mp3 ringtone ( although , there easy hack around it : just change extension . mp3 . 3gp	-1
i bought this $30 best buy . what waste money ! ear gels comfortable first , but after hour or so , your ear starts really hurt i t.t he sound quality terrible ! people i am talking sound very muddled overly loud , even lowest volume setting my motorola v300 . what worse , people i am talking hear me very poorly . they say there so much background noise it sounds like i am noisy bar , even when i'm just sitting my car . people barely hear me over background noise racket	-1
i agree most others , it worked okay couple months ... now , not only it not charge my phone , but if i plug it into my phone , it immediately loses all charge ! it also always falling out lighter plug . i don't problem any my other chargers i carry three chargers me my different gadgets	-1
useless piece junk . worked 3 minutes then broke . since bought motorola-brand one three times what i paid this piece junk . not attracted cheap price tag , because you get what you pay ( or what you dont pay this case ) .	-1
product description should state it not work verizon v3c ! when plugged , it states " unauthorized charger " not charge all ( although , if battery dead , it give you enough juice speak , but it still won't charge (?)) .	-1
service good but product didn't enough info me make wise decision . end i couldn't use product my jabra ear piece . item description should information compatible ear sets help make better purchasing choice	-1
others mentioned , front window blanks out almost immediately , even worse , it doesn't show your missed calls . you open phone . stupid design . it not any exterior lights , such my old samsung , showed when it charging , when charge completed , when voice mail waiting , etc . this phone needs opened get any info . can't even see time without opening phone . while talking phone it blacks out after 1 minute . i don't like either . it also very hard hear it . especially if car , traffic noise . no , i'm not driving , but i'm passenger trying use my phone . forget it . re color someone mentioned . cingular light pastel pink , tmobile magenta ( dark pink ) . one thing i like this phone quad band , if you travel interationally , it great . i just got phone , so haven't used it interational yet . oh , it must tmobile get international service . phone camera , plus other tech features , but i don't use them . i want my phone only phone , no other gadgets . i would never buy this phone again , soon i'm eligible upgrade this phone history . i doubt i would get motorola ever again , i'll stick samsung .	-1
whereas body glove cosmetically looks good , it diabolical flaw inherent its poor design . attachment button mounted rear glove allows quick engagement disengagement belt clip seriously defective . plastic button resides small pocket sewn into rear glove . problem button flange holds button connector glove floating inside rubber elastic glove . pocket stretches ! soon any pressure applied phone when it hanging your belt ( like when you sit down or bump anything ) , connector easily ( silently ) dislodges its elastic pocket !!! your valuable cell phone drops ground you lost it ! you lost your phone but button still attached your belt clip . this dreadfully constructed device designer should ashamed . use this glove your own peril	-1

skin great idea , but it not practical . it too thick work seidio cradle i , so i must pull off skin sync my treo . skin buttons not always line up treo buttons , so i misfire applications . holster joke it snaps over top expansion card slot constantly ejecting card every time i pull phone off holster . not place phone your pocket skin unless you need see inside your pocket liner it not come out cleanly	-1
headset really bad sound quality . i missed reviews before i ordered i shouldn't bought it . considering quality headset , i didn't even try car charger fear it wouldn't follow necessary battery charge cycle	-1

i put multi-clip my belt spring metal bent out shape . i found clip cellphone which fit but tiny plastic part which connected clip holster broke also . case great but accessories suck . poorly made light weight materals . save your money	-1
excellent high-res lcd , but rest phone disappointment . poor overall interface configuration options non-intuitive locations . particularly disappointing how it handled wifi . each application seemed want tied particular wireless source . so , i'd go home try get it wireless , but i'd bring up app , let it spin while , told it couldn't connect , then i'd tell it use local wifi . it just clunky . poor utility things like wifi mean this unlikely used anything beyond phone , very expensive bulky one . i check respond email far faster my blackberry than i could get this thing get appication running connected via wifi . much better wifi management must before i'd consider this phone . this serious example one device trying everything , doing nothing very well . device relatively nice , but i gave it two stars because $500 price tag means it deliver . i bought quickly returned phone	-1
very basic phone not one good ringtone , display or wallpaper . not recieve usb cable . i am going back nokia 6102i .	-1
i gave this one star because there not option zero stars . problems : general : 1 . sim card not store full information each contact therefore useless . phone specific : 1 . sim card failed after less than 1 month replaced . 2 . foolish designer attached vibrator module flat cable connecting base piece hinged piece . vibration causes cable delaminate soon vibrate doesnt work eventually screens fail you order replacement phone . 3 . less contact fuctionality any my previous phones ie . multiple number entries . 4 . one my 3 phones ( 8 month span ) failed after fall 10 " onto floor . yes 10 " ... less than foot . 5 . i disassemble phone clean microphone every month or so or no one hear me talking .	-1

advantages : 1 ) superior protection : i dropped my phone twice onto concrete there no damage phone or case . 2 ) all buttons accessible , though bit difficult get cases . disadvantages : 1 ) signal quality worse when phone case ! 2 ) belt clip useless , since case easily open , spilling out phone when one belt . 3 ) side " ok " button difficult press , same top two front front buttons ( above " start " " ok " buttons ) . summary : usable only protection during transportation , this well . phone should removed case during usage	-1
same comments latch opening easily . my complaint belt clip - it made inexpensive plastic broke off after two days mild use . wouldn't buy again	-1
i dropped my treo enough times break it , every fall directly fault this garbage case	-1
i've silicone case my treo 650 long time . it thin rubber very grippy ( great anti-slip)- once i left my treo top my car ( not recommended ) drove 10 miles , case so grippy phone still top when i arrived ! after it finally broke i ordered this one replace it . rubber boxwave case much thicker than my original case , so much so it difficult use 5-way navigator without it doing what i didn't want it . case not nearly grippy slides off my car seat , unlike original . boxwave offers full refunds if product defecive- since this isn't , i probably won't bother . but my opinion , there better products out there	-1
chargers work great great bargain . however , generic " lg " driver software comes usb cable transfer music computer phone doesn't authenticity signature . i don't know other computers , but mine windows xp ( sp2 ) won't accept it	-1
i got hs805 call home while trucking . i sold aaa battery power source , because rechargeable ones won't last 14 hour work shift even then i no 120v outlet recharge . however , i say audio output when adjusted max volume barely audible 18 wheeler highway speeds . wind engine noise much higher than car similar heard 757 35000ft . this reason alone , this headset junk . advertisements criminally overstate talk standby time well . regular new duracell aaa battery , i get low battery tone after 1 hour standby . 900mah duracell rechargeable battery i get only 6 hours standby time before hearing low battery tone . marketing department motorolla , i say great job deceiving misrepresenting inferior product lacks stated function durability . i hope you enjoy earning check based lying people . hint : get job actually contributes society versus fleecing society . you should proud !	-1

i hate this phone . i moved miami cannot get reception anywhere . it cuts me off minute i enter any building so i am stuck standing outside talk . i get land line first time over 5 years because i cannot use it my apartment , so i am wasting tons money land line overpriced long distance rates . but here thing : other people verizon using different brand phone like lg absolutely no problem ! they actually get couple bars reception , whereas i always one or none all . i returned phone all they could give me just like it ... all same problems . i actually over 30 dropped calls one month . i am now stuck it next 2 years unless i want purchase one full price . top , people right when they say battery life ridiculous . unless you never talk it , battery wears out hurry . volume buttons side very hard use when talking . i usually end up putting it speaker phone accident . i am trying decide which lesser two evils .. chucking this one drawer purchasing different one , or wasting money land line . whatever you , don't get suckered it cute pink color , because underneath it pretty exterior it junk	-1

this very basic holster , often simple best - but not this time . good news : 8700 slips right out ease , swivel works great , clip reasonably secure . minor issue , becuase its plastic , when virbrate " ring " active , it makes annoying rattle sound . real problem 8700 held case two flimsy plastic tabs ( one each side ) . everyday use must weaken plastic , becuase after two months one these tabs broke my case , which meant they 8700 would not stay put . it slipped out fell floor several times . i replaced case , month later , tabs new case broke too . due cheap build quality , i'd suggest you look third-party case options instead this one .	-1
ahhh i see your battery dying . forewarned . i'm betting this doesn't fix problem . i mean really how old your phone ? not old enough yet made this battery tired . li-ion batteries usually last around 18 months ( hence 18mon bunch i-pod users gonna get pissy when i-pod doesn't work anymore you can't change battery . ) why hasn't yours lasted long ... oh because your phone sucks . you like me get new battery it only last 7 hr standby first then drop down 4 hr standby . why ? you noticed yet how hot phone running ? it cooking its internal electronics , your ear , battery . when you get new phone - new one only 90day warranty . t-mobile charge you shipping . you spend least hour them phone . aren't these costs adding up you yet	-1

first pros : clear plastic window designed cover keys well screen , protecting them wear . fit tight so case takes up little additional space my pocket . now cons : dirt debris easily finds its way plastic phone . this actually exacerbates damage dirt grinds plastic phone . plastic screen also attracts dust . when i tried remove phone cleaning , side case ripped . all all , i would not bought this product again . please avoid	-1
if you buying this connect nokia phone beware . it non-nokia part no easily interface nokia software . it uses different chipset than nokia data interface cable , which prevents it using standard nokia drivers . you may able get it working , but i spent four hours not met success . i installed drivers provided . i installed nokia drivers . i even installed pl-2303 serial driver , but i could not make it work . also note this cable serial interface . if converts usb connection your computer into serial port , so you likely not happy data transfer speed . i would recommend against this purchase . spend extra money buy real thing . you'll save yourself some head aches heart aches . god bless you	-1
i impatient buy successor my beloved treo 650 , so last january upgrading treo 680 . i faithful customer palm technology since 1997 , first time , i am disappointed . course , i still friendly palm os , tailor made smart phones . i also upgrade compatibility my 15,000 records stored treo four main applications . but minuscule battery 680 forces me curtail versamail sync phone conversations , its clumsy command bar results unexpected commands ( contrary 650 , buttons too close each other ) . reliability 680 also left desired , especially compared 650 after firmware update . finally , i use intellisync dual sync both user-friendly palm desktop heavy duty email ms outlook ; acquisition pumatech nokia results clumsy new release intellisync treo : intellisync new version added record number " note " field all my records ! i quickly reverted older intellisync version i wonder what happen when i need upgrade ms office 2007 compatibility ... nokia low blow palm ? it time palm responds decent dual sync solution their own . if not , it decided : i switch pearl	-1
i've used palm os going 10 years now . when my treo 270 died , i bought used 270 ebay . eventually one died too i bought unlocked 650 amazon . i called palm " tech support " issues i it ( dial up networking didn't work internal browser t-mobile ) . forgive me saying it , but guy palm support dumb dumb . i got someone overseas who told me one inaccurate thing after ( he insisted my treo 270 never allowed dial up networking internal browser -even though i told him first hand i used it all time- he think i lying him ? ) . he knew nothing phone kept deferring supervisor , constantly keeping me hold it just huge waste time . after few calls like this no resolution i gave up decided return 650 . i then tried t-mobile mda . i uneasy idea switching windows pocketpc but decided give it try . me it huge mistake- pocket pc joke completely unintuitive . they expect you study how use their os order make use its clumsy interface . friends tell me they sell 3rd party applications make it easier use , but c'mon- when you buy phone you expect it work right beginning- i don't want spend time learning installing additional software it work properly . finally , i give up pocket pc ( sold it ebay ) give palm try when i see 680 come out . dialup networking issue no longer problem 680 ( compared 650 ) i buy it unlocked directly palm . overall , it decent phone i just feel way more comfortable palm os over pocket pc . palm customer support still useless , others mentioned , lack standard mini-usb connector simply inexcusable . still , i'm much happier palm-os over pocket pc . i use it , i see battery doesn't seem last very long ( just over 2 hours talktime most ) . i hesitantly call palm support get some flunkie again- i decide cut my losses stop wasting my time their " support " . i'm just going buy second battery second charger keep phone charged . i hate idea making such compromise , but me it lesser two evils . fact palm would release phone such terrible battery life indicative their customer mindset . they just don't care . clunky my windows mda , its battery life least 3 4 times what treo gives me ( even though mda much bigger screen ) . imho smartphone market still going through growing pains- original handspring treo designed good people , when palm bought them out they cashed treo product line but customer oriented mentality handspring went right out window -along any intelligent design evolution treo . most better designed smartphones market ( samsung , motorola , htc wizard ) all made pocket pc because microsoft used it clout take over market . i just wish other manufacturers offered palm-os based smartphones again- this way you'd get intuitive interface palm , without limited palm poorly designed hardware ..... maybe it time i finally give blackberry try .... :	-1
my phone broke after month or so . after spending 30 minutes phone during which time t-mobile continually wanted blame me ( you put it fluorescent light , you put it sun , you drop it , you put it your pocket bend it , you put it your pocket bump into something , you drop it , you break it , you something bad it ) they finally relented agreed send new one oft repeated comment if they determined phone damaged then they would charge me untold sums money . most amusing part conversation went like this : would you like ups ground which take 10 days or ups 3 day which cost $15 ? when i responded ground would fine she said " ok , $9.95 " . i laugh their arrogance .	-1

i owned one these three months , then it started fall apart . it $30 best buy . i haven't replaced it , $30 * lot * . $10 ? i'm buying two more . i moving 20 mph my bicycle , talking someone , no problems . it far better sound quality than my ' backup ' , which jabra no boom . ear volume adjustable my phone , i'm wondering what phones other reviewers won't let them adjust volume	1
device works fine i don't feel i over paid . sure there better hands free devices out there , but this one reliable .	1
so i bought this thing based amazon reviews saved bundle over local retail cost ( yeah amazon ! ) , but that not why i'm writing this review . i'd like talk performance comfort earboom . eargel thingies designed quite well , three different sizes each ear you're bound find one fits very comfortably . turns out i couldn't find any fit my right ear comfortably extended periods use but found perfect fit my mate other side . my wife exact opposite experience - hopefully our daughter inherit more symmetrical ears ! i hate jogging so can't comment fit during activity but say gels fit suprising well folds your ear boom quite secure when installed . i'd imagine it'd take big hit knock it loose once place . sound quality earbud decent , but i feel earboom lacks some fidelity , especially higher frequencies . normally this not problem , but it sometimes make person you're talking sound like isaac hayes . speaker plently loud lack high frequencies allows you tune into tonal range where us humans tend converse , without voices washed over background noise . gels block appropriate amount external sounds allowing you concentrate discussion hand without impeding your ability hear say ambulance while driving . there small slot gels funnels some external noise your drum , while rest gel fits snug ear blocking out other stray noise paths . i've asked people how i sound thus far feedback positive , my voice comes through loud clear despite boom apparent lack length , reinforcing my belief size doesn't matter . fact , i found mic very sensitive even small sounds . forget talking phone subtly typing keyboard our mouse click surfing - they'll hear every click . example , i my house person other end could hear kids playing pool 40 feet away house windows closed !! yes , mic sensitive . even while driving they could hear when i shifted gears . not it obtrusive other person phone , it just good aware they hear it all . what more say such simple device . form fit function all there i would recommend this product . fact , i just ordered - it makes great gift	-1

i love these eargels . my ears funny shape i can't wear regular earbuds , but when i add these gels , they fit great don't fall out . they block outside noise make sound quality like those expensive sound-isolating earbuds . sometimes i need small , sometimes i need medium , depending day , weather , how long i use them . ( i gave large size my boss , he loves them too , so don't say you can't use all sizes , guys .	1
every new gadget imaginable i must report i love this phone because i take pictures make videos ! i loathe charge battery everyday ! perhaps i just got bad battery but i've never charge any phone daily . keep mind i leave my phone 24/7 . maybe i should turn it off . anyone else this same syndrome ? if you're shutterbug like me , you love this phone . i didn't even mention hot pink/magenta color which all gals love . one note caution , if you live hurricane alley like me , you may want carry spare battery just case they don't take down cell phone towers before storm . it may useless locally but you least tell your people you're still among living need money escape carnage	-1

i think this pretty good earpiece ... granted , i've only used one other ( it flimsy little thing came w/ my friend nokia ) , but this one far surpasses one sound quality comfort . where my friend would fall out my ear , this one ( once i got it figured out ) never comes loose . second , listening people my friend , i would turn up sound hear person well , then they sounded muffled distorted ; but my jabra i actually turn down volume my phone they sound crisp clear -- moreso than when i'm not using earpiece . finally , when my friend calls me uses her earpiece , she sounds distant muffled ; i've no complaints people i'm talking using jabra , , fact , my mom said it sounds better when i use earboom than when i don't . ear gels bit hard get used . they oddly shaped ( you see picture ) , there six them total -- three them each ear . lots reviewers complained fit comfort ear gels , while others claim these most comfortable earpieces they've used they fit perfectly ... i honesly say i've both experiences . when i first got this unit earpiece kept falling out everytime i would turn my head : * very * frustrating . i tried pushing it into my ear hard i could , i tried holding it place my hand , but only seemed defeat purpose hands-free earpiece . nothing seemed work . i thinking returning it . i thinking throwing it into traffic i-95 . then one day , somehow , i came realization you sort twist it into your ear -- little poky-out part stuck fold your ear next ear canal ( not fold top your ear ; if you it'll just pop out again) -- then * voila * it stays put . matter o ' fact , it'll stay put so well it'll little bit difficult -- even * painful* -- get out again . i imagine people different ear sizes , different patience levels , lower iqs might different experiences than my own . but all i say once i this little bugger figured out , i golden . i love this thing almost never talk phone without it . admittedly , it bit difficult get into your ear -- i'd say it takes upward 2 seconds get properly ( before you're good practiced it ) , which may not sound like lot , but it long enough not recognize somebody voice or hear first sentence they say , or whatever . * very mild * frustration . but like all things good pleasant , it takes little practice get it just right now i it so i answer phone , slip earboom my ear start conversation without missing beat . fact , i find this earpiece so comfortable i forget it until i go scratch my ear or something ! other complaint i saw here it not compatible nokia phones . fact , it even says right package it not compatible nokia . that funny , i nokia 3589i it works just fine . they make two other models earboom ( one which clearly would not worked my phone ) , both which claim nokia compatible , * neither * those works my phone ! confusing ? yes ! problem it doesn't work * all * nokia phones . while browsing store i noticed ones claimed nokia compatible list phones it works , but it didn't include mine ( it included one , numerically speaking , very close my model : 3590 ); which piqued my curiosity . so i went friendly manager store i he opened two different packages me let me test both them . one them worked , other didn't . strange part it we couldn't see visible difference two units ... then one us noticed one them jack two small black stripes around it ( that this one , if you look closely picture you see them ) , while other one ( one marked nokia compatible ) three . hmmm ... curious . so my advice either know your phone well ( , little book handy ) or ask help before purchasing . all all 4 5 stars . i'd give it 5 stars performance comfort , but take it down notch extended period getting used it confusing packaging . addendum : several months later little piece foam fallen end boom so any sound wind becomes almost unbearably loud person other end ... living windy providence , this bit annoyance . also , while i problem where earpiece would cut out seconds time so i couldn't hear person other end line ( , likewise , they couldn't hear me ) unless i jiggled little jack . this * very * frustrating . ** now , some reason , i'm not problem anymore . i'm not really sure if problem due my phone or earboom . either way , it something buyers should aware	-1

just received it this week . replacing my nokia n90 this model , photos much better ( both optical carl zeiss lenses , but this 3.2 mp vs . 2.0 n90 ) . also , n73 covers all radio bands , making reception my cingular coverage very very strong everywhere ( supposedly two internal antennae ) . n90 lacked one frequency ranges used cingular , so depending city i , i occasionally very spotty coverage . symbian operating system n73 faster than older version n90 , best all , it much more compact than n90 , fits nicely palm my hand my jeans pocket . last , there very smooth operating lense cover back phone , protecting camera lense ( why aren't they all like this ? ) . usual , flash isn't equivalent even moderate digital camera , but otherwise i see this phone best both worlds .	1

i am love ... my phone ! i know sounds absurd , but it true . originally , i suggested friend upgrade their handset getting this one ; seeing how i already so motorola v3t . ironically after displeased 2 different motorola v3t razr handsets ( both them freeze startup ) , i called customer service told ' em i wanted this handset instead . minor contract extension/handset upgrade , i glad i made switch nokia . i've only it 24 hours i'm totally satisfied it . below list " pro con " you consider : pros : - bright visible lcd screen . - mp3-ringtones enabled ( make sure cut your tracks 25 seconds if doing so ) . - video ringers . - pretty fast charge , even while messing around it . - bluetooth infrared-enabled making quick file transfers . - dialing keypad raised easy input . - date enabled screen ( which v3t lacks ) . - comes " headphone jack adapter " which enables use any standard headphone you may . cons : - vibrate functionality disabled handset charges ( default ) . - power button somewhat small difficult execute . - fm radio plays static ( this may varies area ) . you see , pro outweight con this one , so give it try . also , if you decide it not you , return it t-mobile within 14 business days your purchase get full refund . me , i won't returning it because it definitely keeper ! :	-1
i purchased this nokia 5300 black t-mobile store . it come 1 gb memory card i able easily load up 160 songs last night no problems . phone comes usb cable connect your computer . i mac so this easy . you not able download songs bought itunes but you load up aac files mp3 mp4 . you hold up 500 songs if they all 3.5 minutes long compressed 128 kps . my music usually remixed and/or longer than 3.5 minutes each . i wasn't able sync up bluetooth my ibook but i able pair my motorola t305 i using my car . apple not approved nokia 5300 yet sync . i am sure it matter time since phone rather new . overall , i love feel this phone , wonderful 2 screen , color great , camera cool , it very intuitive use . i samsung over last three years i concerned going back nokia . however , speakerphone absolutely great compared motorola 195 i originally got but returned . once you load up your songs , speaker impressive . this morning , i phone playing music one part house , i go get something other end house , i could still hear music perfectly . calling phone better than expected . i talking my friend during busy traffic lots people/background noise i able carry pleasant conversation her unlike my samsung difficult this . phone quite sturdy . i am happy phone not everyone - motorola razor . this nokia 5300 looks bit chucky compared phone but i feel like i very unique phone more than phone . who needs ipod mini when you get this your phone all one ? i just ordered boxwave frost case this phone . there very little chose t-mobile store far accessories nokia.com didn't much either . ***** alarm feature wake up cool too . you choose wake up your favorite song you downloaded you program it slowly increase volume song your alarm . it also comes programmable snooze . what dream ! *****you make calls without even slide phone dial . long you number you want already stored your phone book , then all you look up press green button ! ***** when you playing your music , if incoming call comes , it stop playing song then alert you normal ring tone call coming . once you phone call , you resume playing your music . ***** i said , this phone gem all areas - speaker , sturdy , colorful , i think it contemporary acquired taste sure but nonetheless appealing , call quality great even loud areas , lots little creature comforts . definitely consider this phone if you really like music bluetooth speakerphone . else , this may not phone you	-1

i this phone ( virgin mobile pay you go service ) only day or two , but i wanted write this review before i forget . i'll update it if i change my mind . once you get over industrial strength plastic clamshell monster it comes , it good ride . phone resembles small remote control . it sleek unassuming . turn it things get bit zany animations color screen , but it pleasant experience . sound quality good both ends conversation . it attractive . it works . it seems real no-brainer given other choices virgin mobile service . you fun it or just ignore fun stuff -- but you'll get used funny graphics . ui totally intuitive . you interact menus screen few keys below it if you've doing it while after only setting up your preferences . one thing : this whole service software this phone marketed younger demographic than mine ( thirties ) . while it good basic cell phone plan appealing ( pay you go -- me 18c/min ) , there ton stuff play if your train gets stuck tunnel . i lily tomlin operator character answering my voicemail found wallpaper my first name spelled out diamonds ; if i should ever receive text message , among my canned response options ( come standard phone ) " hell no , " " can't talk , " " leave me alone .

speck rubber case best case i've found my blackberry 7290 . said , it not ideal i'd make few changes . pros -- protects case well ; no screen scratches ; minimizes accidental keystrokes while your bag ; no need use belt clip ( most women prefer purses/totebags belt clips ! ) ; i love fact you easily see whether you new messages ( no need take it out case addition taking it out your purse or totebag ) . cons -- clear case collects dirt ; screen cover slightly opaque requires greater use backlight ; screen cover doesn't fit squarely into rubber case ; screen cover gets scratches it , making screen harder read . i get lot compliments this case , it different enough noticed , people envious my ability quickly check messages without fumble opening closing case . however , because cons , i suspect i'll need replace this case more than once year . but i like it enough i'll pay $35 so . maybe next version some improvements . meantime , i feel like i'm getting my money worth out it .	-1

this samsung most reliable phone i've ever . i've it two years , dropped it numerous times , it still going strong only few scratches . battery life declined during this period time , but it still lasts two days before charging . while it not many features new phones out now , i am impressed how many applications i use daily - alarm clock , scheduler , memo pad , etc . reception usually good too . all honesty though , camera not terribly great . pictures tend weird color tint when you transfer them your computer often blurry . i still enjoy camera , if only fact you fiddle options ( black white , brightness , flash , etc . ) make pictures look decent . video option rather lame though , footage choppy you can't even transfer or send it anything . recently when i shuttle , two girls , both razors , saw my phone exclaimed they used it well . both said they missed it liked it better than their new phones . i am supposed getting new phone too , but i know i keeping this one back up . if you looking decent relatively cheap phone , this good one	1

consumer reports correctly deemed samsung wep200 bluetooth headset best . i hear my callers while driving they hear me . samsung also extremely small discrete headset , so you won't look like cheesy phone operator while driving your car . if you want one " those " people who use their bluetooths while walking around public places , it small enough where people really wonder if you're crazy person talking yourself . gimme break ! samsung also comes cool carrying case doubles charger . this super handy since headset so small would easy lose or damage if not sturdy ( but not all bulky ) carrying case . samsung first bluetooth headset i not quickly return due poor headset volume . i returned my lg nokia bluetooths after my first few drives my car . i simply could not hear people whom i talking . samsung first provide enough volume . i'm still happy it after two months ownership . samsung also approximately $35 cheaper amazon than best buy or other retailers , whether online or person . so buy it amazon retailers . only reason i gave samsung four stars not five because short talk time because it not stay your ear while running . i learned this one morning when i late work ran my car my office . samsung quickly began fall out my ear . if samsung short talk time not concern you , then i doubt there too many other bluetooth headsets this price range provide better performance such extremely small package	-1

this wonderful device . build quality typical htc , meaning very good . call quality good provided you're decent service area ( system not overloaded amr-hr kicking ) . scroll wheel very useful addition hermes line makes one handed use much more manageable . slide out keyboard easy use provides very good tactile feedback . there huge user community very large knowledge base consult ( this perhaps ultimate " geek " phone ) . wm5 rom it currently ships fairly stable provides usual suite applications productivity tools . there learning curve involved windows mobile , but imho it not nearly so bad some ppl make it out . general , things work they supposed this phone . one drawback while device support bluetooth a2dp profile ( stereo bluetooth sound ) , microsoft bluetooth stack found this device horrible . phone ships a2dp forced mono , which means you'll manually edit registry enable true stereo sound over bluetooth . bluetooth stereo sound also set very low quality , which also involves series registry tweaks improve . even after all , there still exists audible inaccuracies artifacts audio . other words , don't waste your money set stereo bluetooth headphones if you take your audio seriously . however , bluetooth work very reliably most regular ( mono/one ear ) bt headsets ( i recommend jawbone ) , call voice quality experienced call these devices perfectly acceptable . audio related drawback this device : there not even 2.5 mm stereo jack . only physical audio out through htc proprietary jack which also power data jack . saving grace here earbuds unit ships actually passable , also availability htc-to- 3.5 mm jack adapters market . even few shortcomings , i would remiss not point out this probably best pocketpc phone us carrier subsidized market . it packs incredible amount power into remarkably usable form factor . if you're need windows mobile device fan slide out qwerty keyboard instead dedicated keyboard devices , this your phone	-1

i've this phone week . i'm using it t-mobile , so your mileage may vary . my opinion , it feature-packed phone reasonable price ( unlocked smart phone , least ) . symbian 9 os runs pretty well , although i experience some lags software freezes ( third-party apps ) . fixing it matter rebooting . i think menu organization could smarter , but you customize much it . i love default screen displays your day calendar agenda . but screen hides main menu . not huge drawback , but it confused me first . photos 3-megapixel camera grainy ( it also vga camera ) . since this phone first , not camera , there also no stabilization control . it , however , come flash . sound quality phone calls okay . your friends , family colleagues hear you clearly . your end , however , it sound like you're talking cell phone . it not bad , but i've conversations better sounding phones . i disagree slightly commenter wireless internet ( wlan ) access . it possible set default access point . problem if you aren't location regularly , you search new network . one way around it pony up cash data plan through your wireless provider . i agree , however some kind one-button auto-detect would ideal . i don't like sim card slot . metal cover pops off fairly easily -- i found out while trying insert my sim card without reading manual first . phone slider form factor moves smoothly , perhaps too much so . default , sliding phone completely open -- something that hard , but not impossible accidentally -- unlocks keypad . n-80 also bit awkward . it feels thick lack better word . its 5-way controller button also looks feels bit cheaper than you'd probably expect . drawback : no qwerty keyboard . you connect wireless one via bluetooth . but assumes you want carry keyboard . upshot predictive text feature solid sensible . when enabled , it works contextually : automatically sms email messages off when typing urls . overall , i give this phone high marks features , but few annoyances mean it far perfect phone	-1

received exactly stated . my only complaint description- they don't state length cable . my tower my computer room i keep 65 degrees which maintained constantly . i extend this cable soldering 3 feet wire , usb ports connected my computer mounted my wall . i projected cable 6 feet , if you yourself , you're surprise . this cable only 3 feet long , otherwise everything fine . one last thing ... description doesn't state this but , cable actually comes drivers phone models , which really helped me . better note , shipping took mere two days compared six days usps estimated	-1

this third case i tried my treo 650 , it simplicity it key success . my first case flapping piece leather cost $35 totally useless . my second " skin " belt clip whenever i bent over ( tie my shoes , example ) phone would disengage clip fall floor ! simply bad design . this well designed premium side case easy use , easy wear gives excellent protection . when phone vibrate mode , you always aware when you get call , page or email . it small enough it not problem when worn suit , sits right place when driving seat belt . good design always fashionable case well made . i wish it came brown , i'd buy second ! so if you're looking right case ... this it . you not disappointed .	1

i agree previous reviewers ( gely + zencity ) regarding this cable . price right , set up easy , ( bitpim program ) you communicate your lg vx8300 efficiently . i loaded my whole outlook calendar contacts into phone , well some songs , wallpapers , ringtones . don't waste your money buying downloading ringtones or music verizon sites ( vcast such ); just hook this cable up computer phone load your phone up music/tones you already own	1

some reviews said both chargers worked fine , but they unable get data cable work . however , i found no such problems , successfully used data cable transfer files off my phone . after installing drivers , just search web program called bitpim . it not exactly nicest looking software , but gets job .	1
usual , motorola provides simple use , reliable equipment but this not all , it more than free , you get 50 bucks out this deal .	1
battery life this unit great . i use it daily hour or so every day , single aaa least two weeks . ( it appears other reviews this vary lot . ) i use this headset both treo 650 phone , apple powerbook g4 . apple , i use it generic output device . ( i'm sure same goes other headsets . ) signal strong enough apple use it 30 feet away ; treo 650 , signal not nearly good . sound ok . it not best . if it noisy -- e.g. , like driving , or hotel room air conditioner fan blowing full-blast -- or if person other end not talking very loudly , then it sometimes hard hear . it'll drop audio -- i.e. , call goes back my cell phone -- when battery getting low . you milk it while longer , but that really your first clue battery . earpiece ok ; it not secure i'd hope . if you're outside gust , you may want hang it . also , people other end sometimes tell i'm headset this one -- they mention i sound little staticky . this my first bluetooth headset , so perhaps my rating higher just because it nifty gadget . but battery life this really winner -- my work-mates rechargeable headsets , it seems like they're always charge them . i use rechargeable nimh aaa , they just last really long time this unit	-1

after reading reviews here " user forum " i decided purchase this desktop charging station . it charge secondary battery rear compartment chargethe extended life batteries well while charger .

personally , i think if you buying any sort razr its " functionality " you buying wrong phone . i personally owned numerous lg phones while they may not small , light , attractive motorola phones , lg phones built last . however , if you just looking cute phone easy carry your purse/pocket use just nice looking phone , this great one own . i previously lg vx9800 before i bought pink motorola razr v3c . i vx9800 because when i college i would text people constantly use aim feature during boring classes . phone incredible . however , now i am working world basically only use my phone call people , i wanted phone easier carry around " cute " . enter razr . i don't recommend this phone if your phone your life -- it doesn't much . however , if you just going using it make calls send occasional text , it wonderful . pink color verizon put out absolutely gorgeous--it almost purpley-pinkish lavendar color . my opinion , this pink prettier than t-mobile magenta much much much nicer than cingular pink ( i am not fan one all ) . essence , if you're looking high-tech phone , this not it . if you're looking lightweight , attractive phone just use calls some texting , this great buy	-1
when i first got my motorola i disappointed standard battery charge battery every night or caught dying battery mid day . some setting changes 1700 mah battery now far past . price , it excellent deal . ji	-1

i use my belt holster all phones i've owned , my i530 noexception . this belt holster feels really well made , it strong belt clip which good how hard i use it . big plus i use my phone while it holster	1
i love my nextel i530 . purchased it almost year ago now . i am northern ohio travel many places around state . no matter where i gone , i take my phone everywhere me , i yet find place where my phone doesn't nextel service . also , very durable phone . i live farm here , we use two-way often communicate . my phone particular dropped several times , once off grain bin onto concrete 35 feet below , once also driven over four wheeler mud . still works like new . i am extremely happy nextel service phones . i know several other people different model nextel phones also can't complain . i would definitely recommend nextel over verizon , alltel , cingular , sprint . other companies such cheap phones it seems . it shame sprint nextel merged - my experience sprint , they terrible no service anywhere , their phones suck too	1
i this nextel it works verry good im verry happy it	1
great phone ... durable so far dependable . i buy larger battery . there one complaint , sometimes person you call sounds like they drunk . i don't know if it service or phone	-1
my previous phone motorola v60i monochrome screen cingular , so i am still getting used all differences phone capabilities barely scratched surface what i560 . here breakdown pros cons so far ( after week ) . pros ( order coolness , best first ): 1 . nextel direct connect amazingly fast their network very clear . 2 . any call , either directconnect or regular call made flip open or closed . you scroll through recent calls flip closed call any them . 3 . if you're concerned radio ( rf ) radiation - you should even though nobody talks it anymore , this phone extendable antenna get transmission point further away you ( improves transmission ) . 4 . speakerphone loud you need it , even dinning room table tv sound patched through stereo system ( very impressive ) . there virtually no lag switch listening speaking using speakerphone ( full duplex ) . you also turn its volume down whisper if you want . 5 . phone little wider than some phones ( like v60 ) , but very light . yet phone meets tough military specs . 6 . rubberized grips phone make it easy grip dial one hand phone comfortable feel my medium-sized hand . phone slight hourglass shape ( wider bottom ) fit nicely into hand . 7 . charger charges battery fast ... much faster than my v60 ever charged . 8 . phone all standard stuff i love couldn't live without : voice dialing , custom rings calls my contact list , handsfree , long recent calls list ( up 20 ) , ability store number contacts recent calls ( without key number , just enter name ) . cons ( order annoyance , worst first ): 1 . phone almost completely made plastic , i've never thought plastic durable metal . while motorola makes truly awesome phones , i worry there might over-reliance plastic protect insides phone . 2 . when phone holster , outside display not visible , forcing me remove phone holster see who calling ( those don't custom ring configured ) or check time . very annoying , i'm used using my phone watch . 3 . icons outside display small those who overdue new eye prescription might trouble seeing interpreting icons . only two parts clear : battery ( important ) date/time . 4 . flimsy port cover bottom phone ( where you connect charger , etc ) make me think someday i'm going look down there find it missing . it easy enough pop off , but sometimes takes " persuading " put back it cover slot completely ( because it needs snug fit meet military spec ) . overall , i really like phone highly recommend it all	1
i'm very happy this purchase overall . this battery huge improvement over ridiculous battery comes phone . talk time internet time increased greatly . i gave it 4 stars instead 5 because bluetooth eats this battery pretty fast . though still better than original battery . it may just phone . i no idea if it good one sprint sells 60 dollars . it definitely worth 20 bucks all day long	-1
only complaint i my a900 battery life . i am conference calls lot use my bluetooth headset which tends drain battery pretty quickly . this extended battery i am able use my headset without charge phone repeatedly . totally worth $15 , plus it arrived 4 business days standard shipping	1
i initially same lousy battery life lot people complained , until i applied fix : palm identified treo 680 device experience reduced battery life when camera used . camera may continue draw power battery when device standby mode . treo 680 users should install treo 680 camera update address this issue . [ ...	1
when i first got my phone , i quite excited . it more memory than my current treo 650 however only after one day i noticed battery life draining much faster than i anticipated . my research , i discovered few things needed before i extend my battery life more than 10 hours . 1)i apply camera patch since my phone manufactured prior jan 18th . this patch found palm support site . 2 ) i needed completely drain my battery until there nothing then charge it 24 hours . once i these two things , my phone lasted few days without charge , i've set my versamail retrieve messages when they arrive . this big plus me going getting emails every hour getting them when they arrive . i've no problems any my sd cards or mini-sd cards . increase internal memory also helps since i use my tomtom navigation my treo . i've heard various complaints , but you work through some them . it great phone	-1
i carrying pda razr cell phone . when i got this phone i gave my pda my brother my razr my daughter . i love full contact list addresses , all phone numbers notes my outlook it syncs outlook . calendar really nice too syncs outlook . i don't try use it browsing internet , but i use t-mobiles t-zones collect all my email all my various email address types . it took some learning find easiest way get everything , but it there you look , called received numbers one key press , extremely easy contact look up my favorite applications stay screen so they only push or two away . it everything any cell phone works well or better easier . speaker phone great one touch ( or speed ) dialing great . i store hundreds phone numbers numbers i choose , then use spot number make call instead looking up numbers ( ie : lee cell spot 5 , home spot 15 , office spot 25 ) i found message board especially dash helped me learn lot phone . coverage t-mobile good any . some areas i service where friends other providers don't some areas they service i don't . all all , i find i service across country without much trouble i drive . if you t-mobile cell service , their t-zones email many other internet based services only $5 wifi service only $20 ( monthly ) , can't beat . full keyboard makes text messaging keeping notes much easier more fun . it not full pda , but it everything i my pda . it way more than phone , really small thin , easy carry , easy lock unlock keyboard . it takes nice pictures emergencies if i don't my camera it uses mini sd card , which i installed use store pictures videos . personally , i can't think negative thing it . it not laptop computer , but i think it best cell phone market . my cousin blackberry he jealous me my dash	1
i tried many many cell phones but this phone unbelievable . i put 1 gig memory card it . right now , i 140,000 word dictionary it , niv bible , star wars , many videos my son , 100 wma songs , ton pictures . it syncs up ms outlook like charm so all my contacts , appts , tasks , emails always up date . it comes bluetooth works great my logitech headset . it also wifi which flawless my wireless network very speedy . screen absolutely gorgeous . camera takes decent pictures video . one best features battery life . all it it lasts incredibly long time . i not found smartphone even comes close these features especially price . i like it waaaay better than treo , blackberries , , or any other qwerty device . it glued my hip i use it all time . i love it !!	1
after trying this phone out few days here my personal resultspros1 . what attracted me this phone fitness features , flip phone design rugged design . so far i like pedometer/running tools . you calibrate it manually if you want best results , but right out box it okay so far . 2 . i've other mp3 cell phones ( lg vx8500 chocolate , samsung sch-a930 , motorola slvr l7 ) this one blows all others out this category . granted this not going contend ipod but cell phone walkman abilities impressive . 3 . user interface . far cleanest most intuitive i've used . but then i guess almost anything upgrade over verizon os . cons1 . i can't stand armband came this . length headphones cord way too long running , least me personally . it taken me few times figure out something comfortable terms cord management . 2 . button layout . my hands aren't big any means but i still trouble some dedicated buttons ( walkman , internet , shortcuts , power on/off ) . 3 . 2 megapixel camera . i said i don't use camera feature often i'm glad i don't this camera . this most stripped down , barebones 2 megapixel camera i used . overall i must say i am satisfied my purchase ; i'm still tyring figure out some features this phone . i choice this w810i same price sony store i opted this one because flip phone style fitness features i must say these two features haven't let me down yet , otherwise i would've gone w810	-1

i like this more than one reason ... so read , reason #1 - it keeps charging your cell phone when you transferring data , trust me this helps , when you transferring 1 gb data you loose reasonable amount battery charge your cell phone . reason #2 - only data played your cell phone gets transferred , so this way you know before hand all data you transferred actually play when you back seat your car . you use windows media player sync this phone ( samsung sync sgh-a707 ) order transfer files . mp3 wmv/wma formats work this phone , i not know whether other formats work or not . let me explain brief how sync this phone windows media player . connect one end cable your phone first usb end your computer usb port ( preferably usb 2.0 ) . if you already inserted media card into phone you see two drives named samsung phone samsung media card when you open my computer your computer . now open windows media player , you able see following tabs just below main menu . left right you able see this order - now playing , library , rip , burn , sync , guide . click sync . make sure your cell phone connected , now you see two halves same window , left half you drag drop your file needs transferred right half where it goes ( your cell phone name apears top ) , usually windows media player prepares transfer file , this takes while . also just above right window drop down box make sure you select samsung media card , samsung phone option very limited memory . once you well versed what your phone play , i would recommed copying files your microsd using usb reader/writer windows media player takes time preparing windows environment sucessful transfer , this saves you chunk time battery power .	1

this kind thing you don't care unless it malfunctions . i've no problems all it . it seems sturdily built , unlikely break easily . right-angle bend plug means it less likely snap off device ( problem straight plugs ) . it doesn't seem made cheaply possible , but instead made well	1
holds phone attractive , snug , leather case ! clips belt holds tight . since phone horizontal not vertical , i don't trouble catching it things . i've broken clip several cases getting out car . phone would catch something plastic clip would snap . this case works great eliminates problem ! perfect solution	1

i've several gens candybar blackberries , 7100 nice but reception/mike horrendous , 7130 much better , finally nailed it . dubious when i take pearl when my 7130 went funky .... but i'll give it full thumbs up now . slightly smaller than 7130 , which oddly make difference , like size decreases give exponential feasibility increases or something . makes my partner treo look like firstgen cell comparison . unobtrustive yr pocket . " pearl " trackball just fine , like it better than roller actually . reception , mike quality also good , despite concerns they reviewed worse than 7130 . writing good too , suretype continuing so durn accurate i sometimes forget check . hey , i like camera . so , i thought 7130 my perfect smartphone , one i just stopped thinking cause it it all just great .... but actually ... i like pearl better . if you need bulletproof email , pda , phone , this yr baby . slightly shorter battery life , but hasn't stranded me yet .	1
this my first blackberry device . fact , this first cell phone i've where i data plan setup . i gotta say i'm luving it ! my email gets me sometimes even before it shows up my desktop . browser very robust seems work great . i've installed few extra applications ( google maps , bbweather , yahoo go name few ) i haven't any problems . applications cover broad spectrum interests really useful . i still yet try opera browser bb . camera so clear without flash it scary . it beats my old cameraphone hands down!i've discovered moniker " crackberry " so true . i'm just hooked getting emails , surfing web listening some tunes , all same device same time . i've discovered whole community simmilar bb addicts they really helpful discovering ins this device . pearl suretype keyboard learns i go words it didn't get right first it now picks up selects i type . i don't even need censor typing too often anymore . i stuck suretype mode caught it right quick . this may because i've never used any other type mobile device keyboard prior pearl . learning curve but shallow hill . my only complaints mp3 player not play through wireless headset . you trick it into doing so , but normal play only through speaker device or through wired headset . also speakerphone bit muffled battery cover actually covers up speaker ! now there after mod kits oem battery cover hole speakerphone , but come . finally vibration phone kind weak . not big complaint but it bears mentioning . overall this device great beginners like myself . i cannot recommend it enough	-1

this phone great ! i got it christmas it works like charm ! loud speaker excellent ringtones cool . some wallpapers bit weird but they nice ones too . ringtones loud you easily hear it ringing . lcd screen big menus easy navigate . buttons comfortable size i love this phone . so far i haven't found any flaws all phone great battery life . i keep it few hours bars stayed same ! i highly reccomend this phone any who like it . phone light weight small it doesn't get way ! i love this phone encouraged someone get one already . even though it doesn't camera , i'd say it still great ! cons .... i cannot think any anyone who says you cannot hear it ring or virgin mobile no good wrong company . virgin mobile great but not designed those people who their phones all day . it not phone fault .	-1
i admit , if you want more prepaid , virgin mobile rip off . but if you're only going use your phone once while , then it alright . i bought my audiovox year or two ago it good investment . sleek phone , outer dsiplay , calls good quality i never would get dropped calls . furthermore , color display great battery life amazing . phone all basic features , looks great , practical anyone who not looking anything outrageous like cameras or mp3 . i also say despite service vmobile good phones . but now i'm needing my phone more more i'm ready dump virgin mobile because whole 25 cents minute 10 cents after too expensive . i agree other reviews . their new " promotions " those hardly last only new customers .. so much customer service . ringtones little pricey , but still reasonable ; test messaging available 10 cents , good price . if you want get more features , minutes , whatever , i say look into other prepaid offers like net10 , tracphone or t-mobile . you get more prepaid t-mobile but phones good stuff cost you bit more	-1

i've using my blackjack 3 months now i love it . sure there things i would change , but blackjack come very close fulfilling all my wishes . cons : * keyboard buttons really small , but then i'm not sure how you could fit all them phone if they bigger . i wouldn't want phone get any bigger . * if you ever see ad number like this - " 1-800-big-deal " good luck figuring out alpha-to-numeric translation . haha . i issue not long ago . however , i think all smartphones issue . * lacks voice dialing via bluetooth headset . this one big me . i upgraded bj razr really miss this feature . pros : list would too long if i mentioned all great features this phone . so here few : * browser support awesome ! i view everything , even flash apps ! * vpn support . if you corporate , ' nuff said . this rocks . * easy bluetooth setup management . * perfect size smartphone . not too wide very thin . * glass screen ( doesn't scratch ) screen resolution unbelievable . * quick toggle scroll button side life saver . * extended life battery comes phone . * easy side access sd card . no slide battery off remove or replace . there ton great things this phone . i hear iphone supposed real deal , but until i see myself , i'm sticking this beauty . buy one . you won't sorry . i got mine $75 $75 rebate . free ? can't go wrong which ever way you look it . :)	1

sansa e200 good all things it considering it only flash memory based player similar ipod nano . unlike , nano it play video comes its own video conversion software . further , unlike nano , sansa built fm tuner fm recorder which nice . finally , sansa voice recorder which i not personal use but just goes show how feature rich this mp3 player . negative side : sansa , which accept upto 2gig microsd memory card , but turns slowly when memory card placed expansion slot . i like listen audio books sansa not ability bookmark . this makes listening audio books very difficult . overall , sansa very feature rich player great battery life only few shortcomings	-1
great choice casual heavy duty sansa user . strong looks good . it even comes clear plastic screen saver . i am very happy this product	1

this great case ! i motorola v180 purchased returned 2 phone cases prior this purchase only phone month because they such poor quality or holes didn't line up . because this flip phone , most cases move when you open shut phone , covering speakers , etc . this case 2 pieces connect together so movement , when you open close phone , doesn't affect placement holes , etc . case . also , quality materials fit this case excellent .	1
this device works great . i use it usb laptop charge treo 650 . i also use it wall outlet car . no problems . cords retract when you want fold it up so very convenient . it not come case , so you'll use your own bag or whatever . part fits into treo very secure . it not pop off like other chargers . only thing i see could problem if you rough pieces or they just loose bag they get lost or possibloy damaged	1

i bought this even though i saw lot negative reviews , some battery life , some dropped signals . so far i neither . i owned many palm devices over years i first one say palm make lemons , when happens they usually deny it until they come up patch much later , if they ever . not most customer-oriented , quality-oriented company out there . but their os still easiest use my mind , myriad apps out there you make it whatever you want , pretty much . screen smallish side compared tx , but it not bad , especially phone . it pretty reliable , i put lot my old software it . battery what surprised me most ; i expecting something really bad , but so far i never under 50% , i am heavy palm user . i don't use phone part it much , just call here there , i turn phone function off night . i also bought kblightsoff , which turns off keyboard lights unless you using it , which probably helps lot . so these two settings , battery life close tx my opinion . i one dead pixel , but happen any electronics manufacturer . i don't like 2.5 mm jack bottom device , that terrible place put it . but adapter i use my good headphones sound good . get ptunes deluxe so you use subsription music like napster or yahoo music . i should receive my 8gb sdhc card tomorrow , which turn my treo into iphone killer , imho . way less than $599 ... sound level ok , you get software boosts it up if you're deaf . speaker level loud ! sms program great , phone app great fast . so , overall , it great device . i wish palm wouldn't charge arm leg accessories , but you don't buy them ..	1
my chocolate phone obviously valuable me , so i want keep it tip top condition , this skin incredibely sexy allows me use my phone ease .	1
whole process took only 5 minites phone cingular wireless customer service port over my number verizon . treo 750 snap figure out , setting up my email took only few minutes . i've owned it three weeks now i am still discovering great phone/pda features . i bought 4gb mini sd card ( samsung memory ) ebay $39.99 . combined it hold 2 or 3 feature length movies plus 200 300 songs . i also bought shure tec3 earbuds $110 . they're best sounding earbuds you get 2.5 mm jack .	1

i problems my second i730 transmitting receiving , so i decided upgrade my phones . ( first 730 speaker grill came off , i tried glue it back myself . word wise , don't use too much glue . ) so , i went nextel get my new i760 after researching it internet . i didn't need camera phone , since i digital camera takes awesome pictures . one bad thing since i changed my phone back april , i couldn't sign back up two years get $150 . i could only sign up year , i pay $275 . i don't understand . but this review phone : cons : super short battery life , especially if you web . instead separate button each number key , it three big keys , little squares make it look like there separate keys . unfortunately , you careful hit button fairly close center , otherwise you'll dial number above or beneath it . jury still out this one , but i'll list it under cons . casing looks like it might break easy since it mainly plastic , whereas 730 least looked like some sort metal . pros : huge displaya whole lot lighter than 730i enjoy photo caller id . it also shows photo when you call personthe sleep mode good addition . if you don't use phone couple minutes , phone power down little like your screen saver so all you push button wake it up . only thing i really miss 730 multitude lights around motorola emblem front , especially since there several colors . this phone just blinks lot your ring tone light blue . oh well . i'll write more more i explore phone .	-1
idropped my new phone bank without this case phone went everywhere - 3 places .... this cover , it definatly protected .... i don't like smoke color ... but who really cares price ..	1
