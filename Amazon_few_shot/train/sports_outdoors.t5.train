we bought our machine 2 weeks ago . it looks wonderful , nice sturdy , alot different features , but we haven't able use it . it didn't work day we brought it home fighting ironman customer service department ever since . they keep giving us runaround saying different technicians coming but nobody ever shows up . evertime we call their 1800 number we're hold least 30 minutes before we even get talk person then they just lie say they either call us back or someone out day . well after 2 weeks , we've it ! we're taking it back never buying ironman product again . they're nice machines good warrentys but what good it if they won't get anyone out there fix it ? nothing against store , they've great . just 2 big thumbs down manufacturer	-1
i purchased this bike rack because i moving out state didn't enough room back my car bike . i also needed rack transport my bike local trails , parks , etc . so , i went schwinn given brand name it relatively inexpensive . i drove nc fla , approx 700 miles , bad idea this rack . i didn't any trouble assembling rack , only took 5 minutes ready go . however , during my trip , i pull over side interstate no less than 5 times tighten straps back . buckles not hold straps place . this real problem if you travelling highway ( or any busy road ) you worry your bike flying off back into oncoming traffic . also , even if buckles hold , wind drag bike starts pull brackets right off rack frame . i purchase 4 bungee cords rope order secure my bike flying off back ( yes , rack assembled correctly ) . bottom line , this rack probably great value if don't plan driving more than few miles or over 40-50mph , otherwise , it complete waste .	-1

this stuff very strong smell -- like wd-40 or something . if you stand smell , you might well buy local hardware store -- least then you'd probably get little straw could used spray it under center your treadmill belt . i bought this stuff because i thought it would odorless , like all other treadmill lubricant i've bought . but it isn't odorless . it really stinks . i don't like permeating smell my house , especially my workout room . i recommend lifespan 100% silicone lubricant . it little pricier quantity you receive , but it good ( odorless ) stuff	-1
got mat free ordering series 7 treadmill while putting mat under my treadmill it ripped . it made this rubbery plastic , it just okay . i wouldn't pay $100 it , it true , but i very disappointed it ripped so easily . not very durable ... but i got mine free , so i guess i wasn't too surprised it given away .	-1
i guess you get what you pay . this pedometer difficult calibrate , continued miscount steps , therefore distance , covered . it made plastic , came unclipped easily . i am big person , started walking improve my health . this product not work me , although it might different story slim person . it relegated junk drawer , probably eventually thrown away . i'll find works better purchase it	-1
i gave this pedometer one star because it not anyone who wants use it straight off shelf . this pedometer work if you not mind working it . it problems need modification . top clip this pedometer pushes against body , making vertical angle 20 degrees or more off plumb . means weighted arm inside drags circuit board not move freely . remove factory clip tabs hold it . add some adhesive velchro back case . make fabric band your ankle . attach ends each other velchro . put strip velchro outside band attaching pedometer band . i get accurate readings this pedometer when it attached inside my right ankle . i got inconsistent readings it my waistline . hair spring returns weighted arm its upright position weakened considerably after ten miles pedometer drastically undercounted . i opened pedometer added strut brace spring . strut made thin brass . aluminum soda would work , too . i made " " one end strut hold spring . i pushed lightly against spring left side , drilled hole brass , anchored strut screw lower left part circuit board . strut angles up just slightly screw anchors it . i now quite few miles pedometer . ( i theory spring weakened because its solder joint circuit board may broken slightly allowed spring twist freely . ) several times pedometer reset itself " 0 " no apparent reason . i know nothing pushed reset button . one incident while it going through scanner airport security . once it reset while i walking . twice it reset while i napping sofa . i am thinking charge static electricity overwhelmed circuit , but i not know . static electricity too many synthetic fabrics problem more expensive pedometers , too . this pedometer uses counter circuit . if someone needs inexpensive electronic counter , connect wire weighted arm wire coiled spring it contacts . connect button switch two wires . freeze weighted arm place hot glue	-1

i so frustrated those so called " sticky mats " , my hands would slide forward simple poses like downward facing dog . so i decided give $50 skidless yoga towel try . this worked pretty well my slipping hands , but i new problem . i unable get traction my feet felt though they would slip up when many commonly practiced poses yoga . ( downward facing dog , even poses like triangle extended side angle ) . i really tried giving this towel chance but ended up purchasing harmony yoga mat ( those rubber mats ) which greatly reduced my slippery yoga experiences . i would not recommend skidless towel your entire mat , maybe you may better luck just hand towel . i realized yoga mats every person different , so what doesn't work me , may work you . i just thought i would give my 2 cents	-1

if you just like cruiser look use bike only occasionally very short rides ( less than 10 miles ) then this probably not bad bike . but , if you want much more comfortable efficient bike , one fit your body properly , go your local bike shop ask see their " hybrid " bikes . this type bike gets its name cross " road bike " " mountain bike " or " all terrain " bike . they available several frame sizes , so you're not stuck " one-size-fits-all " , which not good if you shorter than 5'7 or taller than 5'10 . hybrids available wide range prices equipment selections . price range just over $200 high you want go ( over $1500 anyway ) . price goes up , weight generally goes down quality frame all components goes way up . but even low end scale , hybrid much more efficient bike ride ( more miles covered per energy expended ) it more comfortable longer rides ( over 10 miles ) . if you truly interested covering some longer distances ( up maybe 30-40 miles ) focus models feature 700c wheels opposed 26-inch -- your bike shop person explain -- keep tire width down 35mm or under ( 28mm good size most people if they ride only pavement ) . narrower tires offer less " rolling resistance " making bike easier pedal larger wheel sizes improves efficiency little also . happy peddaling , very experienced cyclis	-1

my daughter 38 " 30lbs . it perfect size her . we mainly use it something lay while watching tv or reading books floor . pros- when " chair position " , it tall enough accommodate taller children . - cover removeable washable- comes handy pink storage bag ( although it kinda hard fit pump bag bed)- pretty easy convert into chair ( there 2 straps each side bed need " connected " order change it into chair - they color coded ) . might hard young children figure out how it . - inside sleep bag made soft material ( although it appears though it may snag easily ) . - large zipper located one side sleep bag . easy small hands use . - weight limit : 100 lbscons- pump very cheaply made it takes long time inflate bed ( it operates use foot motion or you use your hands ) . - air slowly leaks out bed . we actually thought ours hole it when purchased , so we exchanged one . but this one too deflates pretty quickly . example : if we completely inflate 7pm , 8am next morning it needs inflated again because it loses 40% it air . - adult help needed change into chair . - adult help needed inflate . overall : it bit pricey quality i expecting . it would nice if adult assistance wasn't needed change bed chair back . defitely would work extra sleeping spot night , but it takes time inflate requires adult so	-1

field bag claims " perfect way get baseball game going " . while this may true , number games you actually play this set one ( if set even makes it through game ) . first off , these bases you must set up field using wooden mallet pound flimsy plastic stake into ground . one my sets ( i bought 3 unfortunatly same time not knowing their reputation ) , wooden mallet wasn't even glued together , it fallen apart so i just use head . then when i put stakes into ground , out 3 sets i , least 1 each set broke while i placing them . actually place bases , set gives you string device helps you measure out field . this handy except fact it took me 10 min untangle mess then when i went second base realized string not long enough . granted , one could place 1st 3rd then figure out where 2nd went but picture set-up shows string measure base ; however , it definintely not right length . after placing bases team now ready play . however , don't wear cleats these bases . bottom base says , not recommended use cleats boy they right ! our game we tball children using bases even their little cleats ( not all kids cleats ) tore them shreds . our bases lasted one hour before they torn inside cotton coming out . it very unfortunate seeing though we purchased three sets all end hour . this non-profit won't see money again :) so unless you plan using these bases grass easy set-up , not plan wearing cleats , not playing true game baseball/softball .... you would probably better off buying $8 flat bases temporary use ( they left outside afterward too ) . - just not impressed , sorr	-1

i ordered two these high hopes , utterly disappointed . first design battery holders bad . they supposed hold two cell batteries . when i tried get one , i initially concluded different size must requried , it seemed size wouldn't fit . after much futzing around , i managed get two cells without hopelessly bending flimsy contact springs . this one now works but i doubt i could successfully remove replace batteries again . battery holder too flimsy . second unit contact wire which connects two far ends batteries fallen out its plastic holder . after 15 minutes trying put it back i gave up . this unit totally unusable . nothing pyramid package label indicates two batteries , cell size , needed but not included . second this fender mount light , meaning if you want mount it your handlebar there no way hardware included . while pyramid box say " fender mount , " description not included online product description . , this light batteries installed fairly heavy . lightweight plastic fender my front bike tire would not come close supporting this light , i doubt many bike fenders these days would . why would anyone sell this bike headlight without including handlebar mount ?? i'm totally disgusted this flimsy product , vendor who sold it me	-1

i am writing this review hippo clubs general . i purchased simmilar set amazon year ago because it $300 set or irons reduced $100 . i interested graphite shafts ( all i ever used steel ) wanted cheap set travel ( i 2 different sets clubs lost during travel ) . first thing i noticed these clubs my miss-hits rose dramatically . clubs looked nice enough , but their performance less than par . when i talked my club pro , he said problem buying graphite shafted clubs inexpensive like these hippos shafts cheap not consistant . your average pro plays graphite shafts cost up $80 each . he also indicated me high handicappers tend buy cheap clubs ( which humbling fact i swallow ) , high handicappers tend play better steel shafts . all this said , i chalked up my $100 mistake began looking locally all golf shops high-quality pre-owned clubs . after 2 weeks , i found hardly used set ' 04 big berthas $359 . i talked salesman down $299 walked out best set clubs i ever hit . i guess my point if you looking these clubs , you either new or relatively unskilled player -- like me . if this case , take some time search out high-quality pre-owned or used equipment make your learning curve my shorter . let golfers get new clubs every two years spend $600-$1000 new sets . take advantage their trade-ins . that my opinion anyway	-1

this gun piece $# ! my bro got it some time ago . he so excited . it made me glad see he so gung ho his new airsoft . he loaded it , aimed 1-foot target not more than 20 feet away , sprayed accurately possible , guess what happened ...? yup , out 20 clip , 5 or 6 hit . not bull eye , i tell you . 20 shots went wayyyyyyy too fast comfort , accuracy sucked like mad , but my brother hopes not dashed yet . (-_-) he filled up 110-shot mag , winded it up , aimed , same thing resulted , only this time , spray lasted longer than 3.5 seconds . out maybe 50 shots fired , 12 hit . i checked gun all around , but it not defective all , except part this gun made very cheaply . my brother tried it semi-auto , which usually more accurate . not this gun , though . fact , semi-auto even less accurate than automatic feature !!! out 10 shots , one or two hit ! i couldn't tell because this gun 140 fps made barely sound when it hit target ! ( we shooting dark . ) let not even talk " red dot scope , " or " silencer .

this bench bit joke , unfortunately . put bench together myself , i tell you most flimsy part bench part you sit : it particle board wrapped thin vinyl sitting two very small pieces metal , balanced over main structure . i feel foolish buying this bench . shoddy construction fact bench supposedly rated maximum total weight 300lbs -- including you weight you're lifting , i think it would mistake purchase this . maximum width this bench only 3 feet . it narrow . small .	-1
overall , system useable but there multiple areas potential improvement . most important area improvement height weight bench . it too high so there no way perform traditional bench press . second , pegs hold weight bar place positioned where one would normally place their hands . there no way around this other than narrowing your grip . fly bars awkward tend bang against bench support . lateral pull bar provides resistance through some palstic housing which i am pretty sure wear out short period time . weight bench basically relegated my off day strength work outs since it not provide stability support vigorous weight session .	-1

even though they look pretty cool , these mirrors hard focus , even harder see anything	-1
i hate complain too much since this pretty cheap item , but just warn others - i bought this because i wanted ab bench . it really doesn't suit purpose too well since it one incline position only abs - other positions just back support working dumbells . ab position pretty weak doesn't really work your abs well abs only bench would , plus it bit uncomfortable other reviewer said , if you anywhere near 6 ft tall or over , get something else . combined shipping - this waste almost 100 bucks here - while usable , it really won't make impact your workouts . i few sets situps really don't feel tightness i would if i used real bench or even just sat floor matter . if you're budget , this may work if you put something under front base put it greater incline and/or situps holding weights - make sure you pad it blanket or something - position just too awkard . fact it multipurpose bench takes away it effective ab bench - real ab benches one smooth incline , not perpendicular seat bends down halfway which really stretches your back bit too much direction it not supposed bend lol	-1

i went sports store all they carried sportline pedometers . i really didn't know which one buy so i bought this one because it more attractive than bright yellow one it more expensive than 340 so i thought it better somehow . even though it says it measures steps accurately packaging , it doesn't actually display it . it only uses it calculate distance you've walked . i very annoyed this because 340 track display number steps walked . i got over it but thing keeps resetting my pocket . i'm just going buy pedometer . one displays steps walked cover	-1
medicine ball ordered gift when it arrived , it very scuffed up scratched . it also flat spot it . i returned it replacement , which i got , it same condition . also packaging tore if it opened before . i would recommend buying store so you look it . we also same experience above 6 lb . medicine ball same outcome . definitly not happy it	-1

sportline 353 talking pedometer works ok pedometer fm radio , but it 2 issues . good : talking part this pedometer turned off or . it nice hear when you rolling , " 9000 steps . " fm radio very elementary , but functional . there no dial tune . you push button it rolls next station . there volume control earphones . pedometer uses aaa batteries purchased anywhere . bad : pedometer constantly slipping off my waistband bouncing floor . it didn't break , but it very annoying . several times it popped off w/o me knowing i left it restaurant or friend car . ugly : if i accidentally bumped reset button - kitchen counter or arm chair - pedometer lost day count went back zero . pedometer not memory feature - so tally lost . this would sometimes happen 2-3 times day . very frustrating . clip broke after 3 months -- so i retired it . i bought omron hj112 premium pedometer very pleased it . it teather so if clip slips off my waistband , pedometer dangles -- it not bounce floor . it 7-day memory feature automatically resets midnight . it clock . it uses button battery . it not radio it doesn't talk , but it works works well . sportline would good if it teather , clip didn't break so easily , reset button could not pushed accidentally .	-1
all this air pump let out what little air may your tyres . i can't think anything else i ever bought completely useless this . it toy , pretending air pump . nonfunctional lever top ( mentioned other reviewers ) indicates it designed toy . i'm just happy i trying put air my tyres driveway , not out trail . past , i bought number bell products , including motorcycle helmets . i now shudder think what might happened if i put one them test	-1
i carried this pump my bike because small , light looks good . but when i flat pump usless left me stranded highway . this one several bell products i've dissatisfied	-1
scary looking but inpractical . wooden handle it too thick unless you already extra large hands already ( if your fists big you don't need claws ) . talon shaped blades sharp but can't dig , they only scratch . they even hard time cutting through multiple layers cardboard . nice wall decor but nothing more	-1
i used pedometers few years . i initially impressed this pedometer but then i discovered 360 i received not always ' wake ' keep track steps . 360 i received not always count steps even when already ' awake . ' ' sleep ' ' wake ' feature bogus , it not work it makes this pedometer loser . i would not surprised if other users this pedometer simply overlooked fact their steps might not getting counted because pedometer stuck sleep . heartrate monitors , company i bought it not responsive when i asked guidance . i bought pedometer different dealer , sportline 345 - it my second 345 , need i say more	-1
im new airsoft wanted couple pistols screw around friends , found these . i probably just expected too much out them , $8 gun you shouldnt expect too much . well , me friend began shooting each other , bbs curved largely left . not just little , but one them made near diagonal line left . they're really light ( although expected cheap guns ) really clumsy feel . they least look kind neat , plastic orange tip mainly hidden attached compensator ( looks only ) . i later bought $30 gun meijer it shoots nearly twice far , shoots straight . these just useful if you too many people not enough guns . dont expect win these , unless you're fighting other people same thing . note , my friend pushed down magazine release it snapped off . he wasnt pressing hard , it just weak defective plastic .	-1
leather/pleather outting glove soo thin if you plan doing any sparring plan it tearing . i used them once tearing occured during padwork sparring . i would recomend getting glove thick leather so you know it last through beatings	-1

bought mine sometime around christmas took it into water first time trip st thomas last week . it died within 10 minutes water . it never more than 5 ' down while i snorkeling . while i never tested compass or thermometer against known " accurate " ones , it seemed work well enough my purposes . just keep it dry	-1
return first one due non-functioning thermo fault compass . small nice hanging it keys or pack , but same smallness makes it little hard opwerate one handed . i also brunton compass fits hajnd much nicer . we'll see how long 2nd one lasts	-1
i ordered this gun because it such great deal . when it arrived , i took it out box barrel cracked ( big crack ) , nothing little gorrila glue can't fix though . also accuracy isn't consistent , it always 4 or 5 inches off 20-30 feet . i put back part laser off sliding mechanism get it accurate , otherwise it 3 feet high . pellet also starts curve after 15 feet or so too . so this gun good deal but isn't best quality gun i've . you load it top gun , which means taking off laser , putting bbs , putting laser again . magazine doesn't even come off ! it still decent speed , isn't crap ( it just bad ) . it worth 15 bucks though	-1
others mentioned already , i found this thing very , very " wobbly " . i never , ever felt comfortable riding my ( almost 4-year-old ) son this thing . it just felt too unstable . i returned this after only few days	-1

i different experience than other reviewer . i would also consider myself beginner golfer , but medicus not worked me . it might work if you never picked up golf club you learning first time , but if you trying improve your swing it doesn't help . you develop way swing club without breaking hinge , but it still bad swing . i heard golf pro it good if you already solid swing you trying improve it , but not good beginners .	-1
i notice several other reviews mentioning faulty/defective consoles arriving . well , i received my first schwinn 438 month ago . i put it all together , realized they not ship ac adapter machine . i contacted amazon , they told me either send machine back or contact manufacturer . i contacted manufacturer saturday , they closed . i contacted them following monday they told me item back order , but , i could buy compatible adapter radio shack . i . i came home excited use my elliptical , unfortunately , console nothing but beep me .. very frustrating . i contacted manufacturer again , they advised me console backorder would not delivered least 2 months . they recommended i send unit back amazon replacement . i so . i spent better part night taking thing apart repackaging it ... quite job trying squeeze it back box . 3 weeks later , i received my second elliptical . same faulty console problem , after spending couple hours putting thing together . contacted amazon demanded full refund return . they pick unit up , not make me take it all apart this time , but , i am still awaiting full refund . i since purchased vision fitness elliptical real fitness shop my area . i am extremely happy unit , although it few hundred bucks more . this one horrific experience amazon . i wouldn't recommend buying this product , seems like they shipping out defective units	-1

accessories come this nice great , albeit somewhat impractical ( who going use slingshot , anyway ? ) , but thing stands out most this knife plastic handle . survival knives hollow handles go either way far usefulness quality , but this handle cheap , brittle feel it suggests easy breakage . it not too hard conceive blade could break off handle under enough stress , which makes this blade dangerous one use . not buy this knife , or any other knife hollow plastic handle	-1

call this bad machette would generous . it more accurately described machette shaped object . other noted blade thin , too flexible , easily rusts , fails hold edge . handle poorly made mine sharp edges where handle halves joined . if you use it without wearing gloves this " tool " more dammage your hand than target vegetation . th sheath material 1 step above paper . technically it hold machette your belt . but if you draw machette anything other than utmost care you cut sheath . i can't believe company valuable name like coleman would put their brand this embarassing piece garbage .	-1

i bought supra model gazelle sears 179.00 . i thought it so light shock absorbers made good form resistance . well after year welds cracked shock absorber holders useless so i took them off . guy sears(where i bought junkpiece ) says , " ew , man too bad " !! remember light tubuler construction while making ease transport also means ease breakage . machine meant looking good leotards sipping sports drink put it away if you start sweating . if you dont sweat rust out weld joints who knows where you'll catapulted when next thing it goes . maybe maybe tony little give surprise visit you hospital !	-1

not buy this gun hot import toys . my main point . it took very long time get me ( 8 days ) when it , it broken . not it shattered or it jammed . it just didn't work . piston seemed fine , motor seemed connected , gearbox seemed tact , batter ( although little hard install ) charged , trigger connected gear box . i thought i could return it either working gun or just refund . no . i e-mailed hit over 7 times over course couple weeks . nothing ! i got no response , no notification , nothing . i continued e-mailing them because they didn't even post phone number reach them their site ! hit worst company buy ever ! what i see know , this gun seems quite mpeg ! i would loved use it its fullest my friends but unfortunately , i bet you anyhting hit decide wait until 30 day warranty expired before they e-mail me back : telling me how warranty time up they aren't allowed exchange my product . buy airsplat !!! trust me . this good gun . fast , accurate , good looking . not waste month your time waiting it arrive , find its broke , waiting them e-mail you back , then live broken , useless piece potential airsoft gun . so trust me , don't buy hot import toys	-1
i ics m4a1 . i am basing my thoughts this based what some airsoft forums i am registered said this . i am registered arnies , airsoft core , airsoft retreat . 1 ) this gun very , very unreliable company ( well ) , so you more chances getting bad gun than you getting good one . this common knowledge among airsoft community . 2 ) lets say you buy 4 these guns ... each them costing 100 dollars . even over 5-10 year span , adds up lot money spent gun breaks consistantly . people who skirmished lpeg ( low-powered electric gun ) find exterior actually break if shot aeg shoots 330 fps . 2g ( standard companies like toyko marui , ics , classic army , gg , airsoft elite ) . one thing this suggests gun badly made . 3 ) gearbox ( part gun fires bbs ) broke mine . short , it metal gearbox , made cheapest metal known man . purpose this company makes this get money . it very , very weak . definitely not worth it . 4 ) " hop-up " this gun non-existant . fundamentals hop-up backspin added bbs increase range accuracy . effective range this- 50 feet ( not meters ) . effective range my ics m4a1 ( aftermarket tightbore added ) 150 feet . 5 ) this gun get laughed . some children walk into organized skirmish this lpeg , telling people it own all others , they cry home when players real aegs destroy them . i suppose it fine backyard wars , but who earth would spend 100 dollars crappy gun backyard wars ? 6 ) cost not equal quality . if you think all accessories come this gun ( light , laser , ect ) , then account shipping china , then packaging costs ( pre-molded styrofoam ) , you realize this gun very , very cheaply made . you not want spending so much so little quality . laser itself sell 20 dollars . put it short , it not worth it	-1

if i could give them 0 stars , i would . i don't know why they even still make these , they should illegal -- so should all laminated foam rubber stuff they use karate . materials break up easily ; stuffing shifts starts flying all over place . i could give tens reasons why these not only inferior , but complete garbage right out box . everlast general simply isn't good : low quality materials , design workmanship , but these win prize all time worst sports equiptment my book . i recommend buying entirely ringside -- this coming experienced full-contact fighter	-1
our three year old twins received two these cars christmas . joystick control broke one cars one hour after they received them christmas day ! my husband ordered replacement car then shortly after , other cars ' joystick control broke ! so , now we stuck two broken cars one work , but wondering when one break too ! i need mention kids not particularly rough cars ; we right there when other car broke not witness any rough behavior . controls cheap break eventually . cars very loud , but positive side , kids love them provide fun entertainment them . i would definitely not recommend this product	-1

i bought these gloves my wife who problems keeping her hands warm . description gloves would you believe battery powered gloves ( using cell batteries ) would provide heat hands 6 8 hours . actuality , battery only provide heat 35 40 minutes before it ends . make matters worse , only heat provided palm hand , no heat provided fingers ! i not use cheap brand battery these gloves . first battery i tried ( it takes one cell per glove ) duracel experation date 2013 ( other words , brand new battery lots shelf life left ) . battery provided heat 40 minutes before dying . second set batteries i tried ( same experation date ) made eveready . battery lasted 35 minutes . you should also note duracel fits poorly connector case eveready battery fits even worse ! these gloves their way goodwill . maybe they used some one work gloves or something . if you considering these gloves , think again ! chemical packs work much better although they ( chemical packs ) shelf life . it just seemed such waste us use chemical pack one hour walk then pack continue provide heat 4 6 hours . still , better than using up two cell batteries less heat only lasts 40 minutes .	-1

i don't recall ever quite disappointed product i am swing groover ii . last night i went driving range check some yardages my clubs , just so i could verify accuracy swing groover . i hitting my 5-iron 180-190 yards most time , occasionally hitting 200 . my 7-iron flying 165 yards . tonight , i just finished setting up swing groover . my first few swings 5-iron produced readings 133 yards . i warmed up little more started hitting 7-iron . these swings produced readings 121 yards , average 121 . this product designed indicate swing speed yardage hit . yardage off 50 yards , but believe it or not , i think swing speed indicator probably pretty accurate . 5-iron , it indicating little over 70 mph . i've my speed tested before driver it registered little over 100 mph , so this number 71-73 5-iron sounds reasonable . i'm not sure if i just got defective machine or what exactly problem , but i'm very disappointed . i'm very inclined think i just wasted $150 . my suggestion keep looking other products , because this one horribly inaccurate	-1

i purchased kurt kenetic two months ago , am thrilled its performance quality . if you considering purchasing trainer , fluid trainers way go . basically , there four major types trainers : magnetic , wind , rim driven , fluid . later best , hands down ! fluid resistance trainers more quiet , smoother more realistic than any others mentioned . only drawback fluid trainer over time they leak resistance fluid . there three companies solutions this drawback . i highly recommend you research all three test them out where possible . good review page roadbikereview.com . cycleops fluid 2 ultra smooth quiet . they limmited warranty thier products , but known standing behind their trainers life , fix any issues probably life ! one up trainer all advantages fluid trainer , but uses no fluid its designe , it made america carries life time warranty . kurt kinetic , which i decided purchase , imho , best because it utilizes sealed fluid unit therefore guranteed not leak . these three units roughly same price , around $260.00 . steep ? think it this way , this product going your companion many winters , so don't buy loud , crappy one crappy customer service ! you'll regret later you didn't spend extra $75 or $80 quality product . i also tested blackburn fluid , $100 bucks cheaper , not bad price , but since it new market i unsure durabillity or how well they stand behind thier trainers after warranty expiration . i heard amazing testimonials how cyclops , kurt , one up , replaced parts even whole trainers , no questions asked ! google these three companies see yourself	1

little caveat -- this review actually exact same flooring system 1'x1 ' size tiles ( which worked out better me because they little more flexible terms configuration smaller space ) . said , these floor mats really great ! i wanted create home gym space doing floor aerobics step workouts well pilates , yoga , weighted workouts , etc . these fit bill absolutely perfectly !!! they stiff enough there no danger ankle instability because too-soft surface , but they soft enough when you floor work , they provide excellent cushioning . my knees used kill me when i would runner stretch , but now i actually go " ahhhh " i'm doing them , which great . not even smidge discomfort . they also really great absorbing jarring high-impact activities . talk ankle , knee , hip saver ! only discomfort i still notice i really think it just me ) during floorwork when i'm my side leg lifts , i some problems area greater trochanter ( bony prominence top femur ) . but i am very sensitive area due running marathon recently , so again , i really think it just me . anyway , i just can't say enough good things these mats -- i highly recommend them . now -- address title my review ..... my only complaint mats -- i'm echoing recent reviewer this -- when i first put them down , they slid all over place my hardwood floors . because they not completely wall-to-wall configuration i them , this problem . i able solve problem completely , though , buying one those sticky under-carpet anti-slip pads you get very inexpensively . i found yoga sticky mat placed underneath trick , well . but i would put 3 yoga sticky mats underneath cover enough surface area keep it slipping . short , if you hardwood floors like me ( i don't know how they would perform carpet or other surface ; you'd see review check ) , i highly recommend these mats without reservation -- provided you willing shell out tiny bit extra dough get anti-slip pad put underneath . also , if you , sure get one covers whole area mat ( or very close it ) . otherwise , if you come down part that not protected during lateral move , you may find yourself sliding across room losing your balance . little expensive , but really worth investment my opinion . happy sweating you ( or whatever activities you plan use mats ) . :	1

i like how this thing folds up nicely so after scooting around downtown ( kid , not me ) i could fold it up when we enter grand central market without hitting anyone shins . age requirements , manufacturer recommends 5 years age . i say that right but get padding every possible body part make sure teach her/him how fall correctly ... ie , not unpadded body parts like your hands ... red works boys girls ... so if you're thinking pink or blue one some reason it double price stick this ..	-1

we looking light-weight backpacking tent enough room two . seems simple enough , unless you've actually inside some " two-person " tents . some expedition tents meet size requirements , but too heavy considered backpacking tents . we just used this tent first time , we so far pleased . plenty room inside two adults large sleeping mats sleeping bags , bit gear . large vesitibule each side provides plenty room packs . i believe this great warm-weather tent , all mesh . night we used it , it dropped below freezing . we woke ceiling ( rainfly ) covered ice ( inside ) . didn't really expect , all ventilation , but it ice , it didn't drip us . i'll chalk this experience up extreme conditions until we use it warmer weather . one thing i don't like , although thus far it not issue , seam running through middle floor . it taped sealed factory , but i just don't like looks it . i seal it again before spring use , edit this report , we sure end up downpour here south texas . tent fact lightweight roomy , so far , i am pleased . i amend this report after enountered weather it	1

i after drooling over this watch two years wishing i one , i finally got one my advizor two months now . all i say if i known how cool this thing really , i would shelled out $300 long time ago . each one features listed above everything you could want . heart rate monitor target zone settings , average workout heart rate , highest lowest hear rate , more . altimeter tells your rate ascent , total vertical climb stores all data recent workouts memory . coolest feature it store your heart rate , altitude rate ascent/decent intervals 20 seconds ten minutes so after workout you scroll though see how your heart rate affected altitude acent rate . i got completely geeky this information after one workout , i typed it all into my computer so i could see what it looked like . only drawback advizor it gives you so much information , it would great if you could download it directly computer analysis . there no pc link , so any analysis watch or typed hand . but other than , this gizmo perfect . no problems all so far i use thing two workouts day . i am cross country ski racer long time i thought this would perfect training aid endurance athletes now i tried it i know it	1
when product came i realized it wasn't what i looking fanny pack but i impressed its rugged construction . i needed pack walk around disney world thought two water bottle holders would come handy . i like freeze my store bought water bottles so they stay cold all day . water bottles come this pack double wide wide top - meaning you can't wrap your lips around it like store bought bottle . plus you wash refill them opposed just buying dasani . unfortunately , you can't use water bottle holder anything much narrower than included bottles because there just single strap across bottom preventing their bottle falling through but wouldn't stop regular 16 oz . job slipping passed . so i'm returning mine , but if your looking non breakable , wide mouthed water bottles , rugged waistpack then this you . ps some reason blue one cheaper , least when i bought it	-1

i hate feed into mentality causes knifemakers hype their blades " tactical , " because last thing we need give lawmakers excuse heroically protect us banning tools we carry . but first last thing i say ken onion tactical blur it one fearsome knife . curved blade would suited your usual cutting slicing applications , such skinning mastodons so . this knife , other hand , chisel-like tanto point , which ideal thrusting effortlessly through beef ribs or car hoods . it would equally home cutting up cardboard boxes , linoleum flooring , or metal garbage cans . technically , this isn't switchblade . switchblades bad . we know this because our lawmakers heroically protected us effectively banning them various levels . this only ordinary liner-lock knife spring-assisted opening . but if i ever found switchblade deployment speed cutting power blur , i'd say it quite knife . blade shaving-sharp factory , handle lightweight but sturdy aluminum some kind gritty sandpaper-like stuff glued give better grip should knife become slippery any sort fluid . use your imagination . i haven't tried shattering any cinderblocks it yet , but it sturdy enough use yawara stick pinch . folded , whole package palmed even my small hands feels much like disposable lighter glandular problem . i don't even notice it my hip pocket , which where it rides whenever i happen wearing pants . if walking around something this fearsome seems too naughty you , remember couple things . one you buy it wall $55 , wall would not sell naughty things naughty people . crimes , my knowledge , not generally committed knives like these , but such evil implements kitchen knives , screwdrivers , whatever happens lying around near crime scene . lastly , you probably not need knife this fast ferocious , but if you , you * really * need it . you'll it	1

i've carrying using these swiss army spartans ( or similar model ) 35 years . bought my first germany couldn't get without it now . great quality just everything you could want daily use . it small enough light enough it comfortable carry . doesn't all useless " bell whistles " you'd probably only use if you 12 year-old boy scout . only problem ( mine , not knife ) i tend lose one every 6-7 years ... so i bought 2 this time so replacement next time it grows legs walks away . great feature optional eyeglass screwdriver than purchased fits neatly ( via threaded handle ) into corkscrew	1

despite some trepidation after reading reviews owners who unpleasant experiences sg4 , i bought it am glad i . my experiences using sg4 during play very positive , even though occasion weather conditions so bad i could only get signal some holes . large screen allows user easily see each obstacles given hole know distance them distance required carry them . sg4 also provides more detailed view each obstacle well distances front edge , center , rear edge each green . golfers who like know exact distance they hit each their clubs , " mark " feature marvelous . able all this valuable information available 10 professionally measured courses 5 personally measured courses significant value golfers who play number different courses not only regular basis but also courses played first time . sg4 also memory card slot able download more courses when service offered future . i think downloading procedures sky golf web site somewhat confusing but not very difficult figure out use only few minutes effort . i know several low mid-handicappers who love this device , i share their enthusiasm opinion -- i am high handicapper . i also own bushnell pinseeker 1500 slope consider sg4 far superior " tool " bushnell . note : there least one additional cost buyers incur after they receive their sky caddie -- subscriber fee downloading courses 1 year . fees range $30 courses measured one state you designate $80 worldwide use	-1
those who may new suunto , they wris t-t op computers designed manufactured finland use all over world hikers , bikers outdoor enthusiasts all kinds . what makes x-lander stand out first glance , obviously its sheer size . let there no illusions , x-lander mighty big watch . despite its size , it doesn't feel big it looks , though . aluminum case very light quite comfortable , too . next thing you notice would huge amount bells whistles packed into such small device . #1 . accurate altimeter . this invaluable tool avid hiker biker . one thing you must ready remember adjust it daily . find out what altitude set watch before you begin your trip , then end day you need make note where you stopped ( which you internal recording function ) properly adjust it before setting out next day . this not flaw , every single altimeter watch i am aware exactly same . #2 . barometer . i found it correct least 75% time , which more than i say local tv weatherman . this includes thermometer well , which order accurate must removed your wrist least 15 minutes order not get false reading due lingering body heat . #3 . digital compass . this truly one amazing feature , way . once you calibrate it ( which you may need weekly ) you never lost -- especially if you know how use map . #4 . it tells pretty accurate time , too believe it or not . it also comes alarm , countdown stopwatch . suddenly its size now makes sense , huh ? i happen like big watches . i don't exactly know why , but i just . if i any complaint whatsoever , one thing this watch lacking exactly what they included much less expensive vector : tiny little bubble which helps you level out watch compass mode more precise reading . reason why may fact x-lander mineral crystal vector plastic , but either way , it'd nice . i am very impressed just everything associated suunto their fantastic line what they call , wristop computers . if size really matter you , well you may wish go observer or maybe x6hr ( which everything x-lander observer plus it built-in heart-rate-monitor ) both smaller than x-lander , vector , yachtsman many other suunto models yet still offers lot -- but keep mind smaller size comes bigger price . factor all into your purchase plans once again , if all possible , not buy until you chance see some these ( or any ) models person . make huge difference how happy your purchase end up ... good luck !	1

" i shrugged jumper hauled surprisingly light ( it only 52 pounds ) box up stairs . sharp knife , pair nail clippers , thirty minutes several small drifts white packing material snow later , i my extreme pilates put together . first impressions , mat graphic cheesy , frame looks flimsy . however , this isn't just pilates trap table : leg spring hooks placed further back than they studio quality equipment , less likely get user way . push through bar won't drop if you let go it , because metal engineered not slide . there warning stickers use safety strap push through bar . overall , this safer machine than original . when you try use it , though , there few problems : i'm 5'4 " mat too short if you want roll down floor . springs light , i would suspect replacing them heavier ones might overload strength frame . it not clear which springs leg springs . lack clips just silly . said , i everything i trap table . i cat , swan saw push through bar , leg circles springs , chest expansion roll down bar , even magician series finish . kink my shoulder only goes away push through bar started work itself out . i could hear springs ( real springs , not bungee cords ! ) all ( briefly ) right world . this amazing piece equipment price . three caveats : not taller men ; it just too small . not serious athletes ; not enough resistance . not people children if you can't lock it away ; springs not safe little ones play .	-1

we slightly sloped yard so i hesitant getting trampoline . we tried it , it works fine ! my kids love it ! course , like any other toy , they take it spells but it still gets used alot after 6 months . i also concerned first them falling off it . i almost bought enclosure go it but i decided wait see how high they jumped , etc . this trampoline so small , they really can't get lot " air " so they don't flips other dangerous tricks . it also very low ground . i am glad now i didn't get enclosure . we don't really need it . i would recommend this trampoline younger kids . weight limit 120 lbs so it can't support larger kids . also , since it so small , we only let our two preschoolers jump together . when we guests over , it one time . i love it my kids want outside so much . this better money spent than video games , my opinion	1

bowflex one most amazing machines i ever used . its range exercises little creativity your part , you just any exercise you want . i completely recommend this if you don't time go gym or if you just really enjoy working out home . one disclaimer , don't think you get same results you get free weights . if you avid free-weight lifter , you get your kicks out maxing leg press perhaps even maxing bench . powerrods tension proportional amount bend you give them . thus , if you exercise 100 pounds resistance , but only move power rods through their first half bend , you aren't getting 100 pounds resistance . also , when you extend arms pulleys wide grip bench , you decrease amount bend rods point where , even if you bend them all way , you aren't getting full resistance . don't get me wrong , i love this thing ; i've mine past 2 years it amazing . i work out twice day 45 minutes hour each session , only because i don't time make it gym . get this if you very serious workout out home don't lot space fit other equipment . make sure you positive attitude going into lifting programs . experiment ideas different exercise movements . more than anything , this piece equipment blast use , fun it	1

i little skeptical gazelle first because it didn't look like you could get work out using it - but i wrong ! but let start beginning : it pretty easy set up - directions dvd great i could it all myself . i really excited use it so i hopped right ( i'm already used ellipticals ) enjoyed great workout . i sweating after watching training dvd , i worked my upper body lower body . i look forward using it tomorrow . now i don't drag myself gym . i work out home ! downsides : it squeak , but some wd40 or petroleum jelly should fix . it folds up but it not extremely portable . i it my living room currently . all all i recommend this product . i feel toning good diet weight training , you'll see results	-1
when product came i realized it wasn't what i looking fanny pack but i impressed its rugged construction . i needed pack walk around disney world thought two water bottle holders would come handy . i like freeze my store bought water bottles so they stay cold all day . water bottles come this pack double wide wide top - meaning you can't wrap your lips around it like store bought bottle . plus you wash refill them opposed just buying dasani . unfortunately , you can't use water bottle holder anything much narrower than included bottles because there just single strap across bottom preventing their bottle falling through but wouldn't stop regular 16 oz . job slipping passed . so i'm returning mine , but if your looking non breakable , wide mouthed water bottles , rugged waistpack then this you . ps some reason blue one cheaper , least when i bought it	-1
i got this accessory my door gym i like it . but , when they say this " efficient " accessory - they mean it . it simply rests narrower neutral grip posts door gym . door gym multiple grip areas , but two them perpendicular rest bar narrow neutral grip chin ups . broad reach bar wide downward grips ( like lat pull down bar gym ) . anyway , this works fine if you faith try it first time prove yourself it won't roll off because your body weight it pinned posts . it foam covering adheres foam door gym posts . it not roll easily , but it little . i think it safe adults who understand how use it . not give it kids younger than 15 ( my estimation ) because some them too likely play , or misuse , it get hurt . even though this thing works what you want broad bar let you , i deducted point rating because i don't think they up front explaining exactly what it not	-1

it suprisingly easy me put together considering i'm 110lb girl . it only took 3 hours but i trouble getting all screws get into their proper holes . it slightly rickitty however i go fast i want it won't brake or anything . it really nice able lose 200 calories while you watch your favorite t.v. shows . also , i am very tall i plenty space , it nice handle bars front either side . if you looking reasonably priced bike won't brake you , marcy good choice	-1
i got this bike i instantly liked it . only problem seat could not fit properly base . i tried many times tighten it up but doesn't help . well , other than its wonderful bike , zip noise would burn lot calories .........	-1
price this low-end home gym generally able things i wanted cheap home gym . however , there few issues you need consider before buying it . biggest issue ergonometric - this unit not designed used anyone over perhaps 5'10 " or 5'11 " . i'm 6'1 " this creates problems me . i find work-arounds use unit designed people smaller than me . problem form very important when doing exercises ( when you don't pay attention form , you either reduce effectiveness exercise or risk injury ) finding work-arounds sometimes compromises your form during exercise . there also few quality issues but these not entirely unexpected considering price unit . it would nice if bench padding little better but its adequate . two most annoying quality issues involve plate bars ( bars hold weights ) . this first issue plate bar lat tower ( cable ) unit . it wasn't level . this means weights keep trying fall off one side you put them . second issue also plate bars . unit designed accommodate standard plates ( small holes middle ) or olympic plates ( big holes middle ) . " sleeve " included unit slips over standard size plate bar enables one use olympic plates ( big holes ) . however outer diameter sleeve slightly smaller than standard olympic size so olympic size spring collar ( hold weights bar ) too big doesn't work . i went down home depot bought wood clamps hold plates place . kind pain but functional ( just work-around ) . if you buy this unit you probably want go standard plates ( small hole ) rather than olympic plates ( big hole ) . so i put this 4 stars because this price you really can't expect too much it generally delivers what i expected cheap home gym unit - one caveat : persons over 5'10 " should try find home gym designed taller people . since only 5% us population over 6 feet tall manufacturers tend design smaller people . if you're tall , good luck search	-1

i purchased this christmas my 8 year old son play . it $329 free shipping compared $450 local sports store . finished product looks great , appears rugged stable quite easy adjust . i only gave it 4 stars because assembly not easy , i am mechanically inclined . practically all holes needed drilled or reamed out order accept bolts directions ambiguous . it 4 hour assembly , filling base screened sand really taxing my patience . but smile 8 year old face well worth aggravation . side note , i ordered 70% my christmas shopping amazon , everything except this arriving before estimated delivery date ( everything else shipped ups ) . they shipped this via dhl , which never delivered package . i drive 120 mile round trip pick it up dhl facility take time off work friday before christmas retrieve my son primary gift . i emailed amazon requesting $70 credit reimburse me my time gas , which they few days . this oversized package i assume ups would not accept . nonetheless , their choice shippers reflects amazon company .	-1

i recently purchased pair gripmaster hand finger exercisers order help build forearm strength . i unsure which tension would appropriate , i bought one each light/blue ( 5 lbs . tension ) medium/red ( 7 lbs . tension ) grips . i've them little more than week now , i just love , love , love them ! perhaps that little more enthusiasm than anyone should muster up exercise accessories , but i really enjoy grips . i leave one out my desk all times , get little work here there when i stop read document or whatnot . gripmaster exercisers different conventional grips you either work your entire hand once , or each finger individually ( great guitar players , i've heard ! ) . one side features four small levers , each its own spring , squeezed together or one time . plastic flip side molded together so you work your whole hand one unit . black rubber cushion removable , you place it either side grip . it awesome idea , allows maximum versatility ! just reference , i'm female , relatively good shape , but painfully little forearm strength ( my biceps huge years tae bo , though ! ) . 7 lb . medium/red grip do-able , but challenging . 5 lb . light/blue grip , other hand , makes much easier workout ; i oftentimes find myself squeezing it while doing other things , i only feel it after number reps . if you're female not great shape , you'll want start out light/blue grips ( or even extra light/yellow ones ) , work your way up . out-of-shape guys probably get away medium/red ones start . if you've got good hand/wrist/forearm strength , don't even both lighter tensions - skip ahead medium/red or heavy/black . although i've only owned my gripmasters week or two , can't personally vouch their durability , they seem sturdy well-crafted . my fianc brother , amateur boxer guitar player , used his years without problem , so i faith i'll squeezing these babies well into 2015 ! - kelly garbato , couch potato turned fitness fanati	1

i just wondering actual things this sword . ever since i seen game played it iv wanted sword sephiroth . but i want know actual information like even if edge beveled , it sharpend ? its steel 440 carbon ? it fall apart if its actualy used ? it full tang or half tang ? whats gaurd pommel made ? kinda thing . i just wanna make sure before i pay $100 it it used . please if anyone knows any these questions answer them me replying me envy_274@yahoo.co	1
hitch easy assemble easy use . we found it holds our bikes securely out scratching frames . straps easy fasten we like fact straps attached hitch so they not get lost . i also like fact bikes easy see my rearview mirror , but they don't obstruct my view or my taillights . it well designed product , but we modified holes hitch match our receiver so we could utilize locking hitch pin . this too nice rack leave unsecured vehicle . if you're hauling bikes , you probably going leave vehicle parked ride bikes . unless hitch locked or removed vehicle , it open easy thef t.t he hitch lightweight , but very strudy design . we also like it tilted gain access cargo area van . we hard time finding bike rack would hold five bikes . it easy fold up store garage . this great . well designed ! great product	1
i recently started casually lifting gym . after getting into heavier weights , i found my limits more based what pain my hands could take holding metal weights bars , instead what my muscles could lift . so i bought these gloves couldn't happier . now i focus lifting weight rather than worrying my hands getting torn up . i'm new weight lifting , but even light moderate weights these gloves make big difference . i'm sure other gloves would trick too , but these great price look . they run small , so order size up if you're uncertain	-1
surprised hubby his birthday he amazed very little assembly time needed . he enjoys pedaling around neighborhood , acting like little boy i know exists inside him	1
i grew up single speed bicycle later purchased 10 speed when they all craze hated it . it so very uncomfortable , nothing worked well , all those gears levers made me nuts . put end my recreational bicycle riding until now . i like this bicycle . this my first bicycle 20 years so i am amazed light weight this machine . electric blue paint briliant exciting , two my adult neighbors commented they really like style . i too ! i am 5'8 " , 175 lbs found this bicycle comfortable size me . riding position upright comfortable , just like it when i kid . no stooping over into racing position me ! 7 gears work easily smoothly easy rotating motion right hand grip . no more goofy levers me ! hand brakes work well quiet . no more squealing brakes me ! seat comfortable 2 hour ride chicago lake michigan bicycle path . no more skinny painful seats me ! tires fat ride smooth like they when i kid . no more skinny rough riding tires me ! i find this bicycle overall pleasureable riding experience . before you get me wrong , i am not against speciality bicycles or technology any way . i'm just not " technology victim " . i just want technology work me , i don't want pay " capability " i never use . i want comfortable ride keep up most pack , this bicycle meets those requirements me . bicycle arrived good condition secured shipping box very professionally . it took me while assemble machine ( foot pedals , handle bar assembly , seat assembly , front wheel , inflate tires ) adjust seat handle bar height . bicycle comes owners manual overwhelming amount assembly information mostly useless . most it pertains other models assembly already factory . if you few good tools , take your time , don't get overwhelmed printed material , little mechanical ability you get assembly few hours . my tips : make sure front fork facing correct direction ! i put it together backwards which made front tire hit my foot every time i turned handlebars . don't inflate front tire until after you install it frame . inflated tire never clear brake pads . inflate tires fully before you check see if brakes need adjusting . wheel rims shift slightly when tires inflated changing alignment brake pads , i need some adjusting front brakes . front wheel some wobble it but nothing serious . if you don't any mechanical ability some basic tools i would not recommend trying assemble this bicycle . you won't find this bicycle schwinn store , closest schwinn model they cost you almost double . four stars	-1
i purchased this after using friends it fantastic ! quality second none . it attaches you glasses easily stays put . it easy adjust just any direction . i would highly recommend anyone looking rearview mirrow biking	1

all five boxes arrived relatively good shape ... some punctures but not bad . internal components packaged styrofoam so they well protected . i decided xtreme2 after trying out bowflex se xtreme(1 ) . bowflex se seat very uncomfortable me didn't multi-pulley system like xtreme2 so it would require little more effort move cables around . i would recommend xtreme2 over se few hundred dollars more . setup took me 4 hours , but i moving slow pace so not miss any components . instructions pretty good . when assembled you see this real solid piece workout equipment . bowflex good job it . using it approx month am amazed many positions available probably lots more if you use your imagination . highly recommend xtreme2 those who know this machine they want . serious bodybuilders should go elsewhere because resistance totally different feel i know weights not compare one one bowflex versus free weights . anyone wanting put muscle tone this great machine . if your sole purpose get " huge " you should get some type power rack . i call bowflex three times some minor questions/comments they answered phone within 15 seconds each every time day or night . great customer satisfaction . one last thing , if you serious working out fairly strong , get 310 upgrade because it make changing out rods much easier you . look around prices too . also , one more comment ... i purchased 50 " x60 " rubber mat amazon approx $49 it pretty nice but i don't really think you need one bowflex since it sits only four corner legs nothing else touches floor anyway . you probably could get some small size pads . -try one out somewhere before you buy good luck	1
i think bowflex xtreme 2 awesome . i now it 2 weeks i really feel difference . i recommend this machine person serious good home work ou	1

i purchased wenzel twin air bed anticipation friend coming visit , not camping which probably its intended purpose . air bed very nice price , very functional easy set up . it took few seconds figure out manual pump , then few minutes fill it up ( get ready use little elbow grease ) . beds pretty short when fully inflated , so i would agree " buy two " suggestion if you're using them home . if you're using them camping only need get off ground , then you're probably more than fine single	1
after extensive analysis various battery 12v fan options , i decided purchase this product facilitate my cardio workouts . instead mounting fan dash automobile or boat , i attached it one specific piece equipment , lifefitness 9500hr elliptical machine . this aid cooling during my one hour/ 1,200 calorie workouts . this purpose , it excellent job . caframo ultimate 12v fan most powerful compact fan i identified thus far . exceptionally solid construction , it far sturdier than other 12v or battery fans i tested . quality components evident throughout design , highlighted large machined brass knob controls angle . other design elements questionable , however . one feature this fan i dislike it use exposed , soft fan blades . my particular application , this led vibration problem . realize power life required , i connected fan two ( 2 ) 9.8 volt rc batteries series total 19.6 . this arrangement , fan develops intense volume air . there quite bit vibration i assume due flapping blades . lack housing , which directs airstream , creates problem . any crosswind , however slight , severely limits fan effectiveness . it would seem almost impossible use this any outdoor application this reason . short , this one best consumer 12v fans available . however , you may want consider alternatives if fan subjected any disruptive airflows .	-1

like other reviewers said these made plastic . however said it high quality thick plastic , they never feel weak all . i weigh more than two reviewers before me ( 230lbs or so ) , but they still feel completely solid , so shouldn't any issue all . i like these bars couple reasons . one you lower your body below your hands , providing workout different muscles . second it lot easier put your hand around nicely padded bar then flat floor , so this makes whole setup easier . they also break down so you store them smaller areas , or even travel them . you wouldn't think it makes much difference , but it , well worth money	1

pogo stick very well-built . we first bought one locally , but some problems foam splitting . second one we bought here amazon . it came quickly , it no problems kids really enjoying it . one thing careful : there no packing or space around pogo stick ( after all it already foam-wrapped ) . since ends box heavily glued , you might thinking using knife open it . since pogo stick just under cardboard no protection , you use knife ... enough said . fact , packaging only reason i marked it down - it just too easy damage if you use any tools all open it . just rip it apart , you'll fine . highly recommended	-1
whoever claims they got hurt this stick , just fyi , its probably your own fault . it rocks just jumping up down , but it even better tricks . only problem it it wont stand up much abuse , i tried vert stall ate it hard hanlebar bent . but yo order replacement parts online so it okay . overall awesome stick	-1

i bike 3 weeks am happy overall . it very smooth quiet even when resistance increased . it also wide range resistance highest resistance providing more than i would ever need . but i couple issues mention . when bike arrived , one plastic feet rear stabilizer bar broken . i called manufacturer they immediated sent me replacement rear stabilizer bar . when arrived , one plastic feet broken it too . so i unscrewed good one replaced my broken one . apparently there quality control problem part . when working out i noticed slight click each revolution . it turned out coming one pedals . i tightened it down extra hard click went away . now , despite low frequency rumbling sound , it very quiet . i think sound normal , it certainly not interfere workout . it quiet enough i forget sound once i get going . seat hard little uncomfortable . i handle 30 minutes it which how long i am currently working out . maybe i buy new seat one these days . seat post looks standard so any seat should fit . but i would still buy it again if i choice . i paid $400	-1

while doing research online , i intrigued 40 lb weight vest priced approx . $75 , considering average retail price closer $200+ . i worried some reviews posted but decided give product shot . needless say , i pleasantly satisfied would recommend this product . vest itself number positives : first , fact weight conveniently compartmentalized into 35 or so small weight bags offers me lot flexibility terms weight adjustment configuration . i put weight high , center it my breastbone , or place it low . i found placing it different configurations actually changes my workout approach . second , i like fact i adjust vest solidly around my abdominal line , not worry shoulder area , which permanently stiched . third , i also like fact it broad shoulder straps , which helped distribute vest weight more comfortably . apparently , this " product differentiator " more expensive vests . stiching solid so far ... i concerned because vest made neoprene , but no problems so far . i feel it only few negatives : material neoprene takes little bit time get used , particularly its smell right out box . i am still concerned using neoprene b/c potential stich breaks ... my experience wetsuits makes me leery stiching neoprene , but fortunately there no zipper area or cuff areas may generate fraying . vest covers lot area , neoprene really makes you sweat when you work out . very careful using this product warm rooms or outside sun : hydrate . finally , since vest covers most my torso , i get strange looks gym when i come inside wearing vest ! thankfully , there logo front , but today day age , average fellow gym rat would probably double take make sure i'm not wearing some sort bomb vest . perhaps if they would offer different color , such grey or blue , it would make product more friendly public . overall , i thank gofit solid product very reasonable price point . i am former military man , who takes his workouts seriously , this item definitely enhance any fitness regimen . thanks reading !	-1

my son , now 20 months old , loved his cube since age 6 months . he very short attention span , but he easily play his cube 20 minutes time . it dropped he thrown it too many times count . today , battery cover popped off broke . i am hoping i glue it together make it work again . if not , i happily shelling out $29.99 replace his cube . it well worth money	1

even though hand guard doesn't fit , it excellent training sword ; i accidentally smashed my friend training sword half this one ^__^ ;;;; it take lots abuse , but it starts look sort rough when paint begins coming off use time . it great practice sword ; it heavy , 5-7 pounds , so it also good learn control sword so you don't stab yourself mid-swing .	1
i enjoy this workout . it quick , efficient different previous firm dvds , most which i . i consider myself advanced exerciser however must tell you heavy cords definitely take strength work . i hard time biceps move definitely forward shoulder motions . you really hurt yourself if you're not careful so it may good idea workout suggested without cord , learn moves then use cord second time around . i adjusted modified my workout so i use heavy cord moves i know i achieve push myself towards then i use looser cord those forward shoulder motions until i am ready take heavy cords again move . also , they move pretty quickly this dvd if everyone knows how loop cord through quickly . i rewind couple times see what she doing . overall , i said , it solid , effective workout definitely nice break heavy weights leg presses i every other day . so if you're looking something different but still under firm , this good one . i also recommend toning ball dvd aerobic one allison lead . those great too . like i said , i them all , i love results they give	-1
this light takes all guess work out riding dark . i previously relied cateye opticube led ($45 ) which places round spotlight light ahead you somewhere . this fine if streets lights , but not enough when it completely dark . led , you remember what you see ahead you . led , you maneuver light spot around where you need it track corners . led i found myself always concentrating interpet what lay ahead . hid solves these issues bathing entire area light . it lightweight ( good because i lift my bike up stairs ) . little dangly ( red/yellow ) thing switch display . it small red/yellow/green lights inside it indicate battery status you mount this handlebars . hid light detached mount which good when i flip bike over maintenance . i get 1.5 hours full strengh then it switches lower setting 30 minutes . i can't really tell difference high/low settings anyway . charge time 2.5 hours . it first discharges battery keep it happy . manual says you get 300-500 cycles/charges per battery before it down 80% , light lasts 1000 hours . it great light allows me ride faster , safer daydream green lantern without crashing	1

i've using this week now . i'll make 10 points . 1 . i lower back pain ( car accident two years ago ) pretty much constant . it gets worse after any exercising ( running , treadmill , eliptical , etc . ) 2 . i taking ibuprofen years reduce inflammation . 3 . inversion table something i saw thought what heck let try it out . 4 . it great tool pain management - it help relieve pain ( obviously not permanent)5 . i think it working me because it helps decompress my lower discs : specifically l3/l4/l5/s1/s2 i feel less " clicks " during normal business day . 6 . use it 2-3 times day , short periods ( 1-3 minutes really try " let loose " )7 . i exercise not feel sharp pain afterward - my range motion increased8 . i've noticed better posture9 . more range motion10 . my expectations met . this table very comfortable not woobly like other i've heard	1
hello , i just got this rack my mountain bike . first i didn't think i made good decision . but , after i properly secured it bike saw how good it went lines bike , well how sturdy it i knew this rack wasn't going any where ( accept , every where i went my bike ) but my bike good . even though it quick release " qr " system works great . way topeak designed this system great . if you get rack stand alone your bike or get it one topeaks bags ( which i ) you won't disappointed . only thing i think would improve this rack directions . not only rack it self but , i think piece plastic comes rack looks like clip , rear l.e.d. holder . this holder most likely lights like cateye tl-ld1000 . i'm not sure but it sure looks way . i heard people saying they problem rack swaying back fourth while riding but only way i gotten it move if my seat clamp isn't tight enough it would then move my seat ( post ) . but simple fix tightening seat post clamp . bottom line : if you full suspension bike looking good solid rack , look no farther . :	1

i always wanted speed bag , despite not knowing anything boxing . since i live apartments tend move quite bit , i not feel like buying professional one required making holes wall . when i saw this i bought it right away , i chest-high counter seemed made specifically this . it seems work pretty well , but suction not very good . once i managed smash dish when thing simply took off after punch , but rare event . what happens regular basis thing moves while you use it . however , i could received one defective suction cap , so not discouraged . if you avoid putting breakable objects other side speed bag , you should fine . even if it takes off , it not heavy thus it unlilkely much damage . would buy it again despite this defect ..	-1

i don't play golf , but didn't stop me picking this umbrella up , i sick tired cheap 99 cent store umbrellas would break so easily . this umbrella indeed huge , but since i carry laptop backpack me almost everywhere i go , i wanted something would keep it dry during rain , even though backpack water resistant . i've outside rainstorms this it just laughs rain wind . i see other people umbrellas buckle under storm gusts , even flipping inside out , yet this thing , its amazing flap system , stays intact , i just hear wind rustle through flaps . my only complaints handle isn't comfortable it could , since it 62-inch umbrella , it very tall , can't fit backpack like mini-umbrella . otherwise , i love this thing , its lifetime warranty , i should've bought this sooner . well worth extra upfront cost save long-run , i won't smashing any umbrellas against side highway overpass rain after it keeps inverting due high winds . ( yes , this happened me , yes , drivers started looking me strangely	1
this umbrella really lives up its name ... gust buster !!! i bought black one skymall.com ( around $40 ) couple years ago used it while i down caribbean going school . strong winds down there would invert most other umbrellas but this one wasn't even phased wind . flap system they this thing genius ... all umbrellas should . hope this review helps , chrisupdate : get same gust busting effect much cheaper wal-mart	1

i just received my bodylastics maximun tension set absolutely love it !! first , you should know reading this page item ships bodylastics warehouse . it took just 2 days get it me their warehouse after i placed my order , superfast shipping . after opening it up , i immediately put it test . my problem area my shoulder , specifically my left , i hard time working it our properly dumbbells . bodylastics tubes gave incredible tension allowed me comfortably work my shoulder out . after few sets , my shoulder healthy burn like i just my sets cable machine . i then put it through every conceivalbe test i could think . legs .. abs .. biceps .. triceps ,... everything given thorough work out . i want make special mention door anchor not so much put mark door ; i using it hollow in-door door not solid outside door . tubes allowed me perform each exercise slowly deliberately , while focusing muscle i trying work without worry dropping free weight my foot . maximum tension set produce up 150lbs tension if you use all tubes once use only one handle ; plenty me . i would definetly recommend this purchase whole range people ; everyone complete beginer up most expereinced weight lifter . i would especially recommend people physical therapy or anyone recovering injury consult their therapist or doctor consider this product use during their therapy workouts because exercises using this set require slow , deliberate , smooth movements without hazard posed free-weights	1

i got my first vector three years ago , rei . yes , it large . not problem me i am large . i am my third vector ; first two , some strange reason , leaked water , first during incredible monsoon rainstorm mountains arizona , second while taking shower . no , i not submerse watch , nor push any buttons while water ' ' . fortunately , rei accepts returns no questions . it testament how nice this watch i continued replace watch . perhaps i models bad production run , my present vector lasted over two years nary leak . good : i found digital compass very accurate useful . remember it must calibrated time time , don't forget declination . barometer very useful . barometer function constantly operating , accounts nice little symbol upper left display showing pressure trends over past few hours . this very useful if you understand barometric pressure trends their likely results . if you not , look it up learn , you find it very useful if you spend lot time brush . remember barometric pressure must calibrated against absolute sea-level readings time time , especially during rapidly changing weather conditions . once you understand relationship altitude/changing weather , you master complexities both barometer altimeter , understand just how simple they , how reliable this device really . i checked it against my high-end gps other barometers many times , it very accurate indeed . temp useful if you need know temperature ; like all such devices , it taken off your body ten minutes before you get accurate reading . bad : lens plastic . if you any experience fine coated-glass , you fine this : not , ever , wipe any dust or dirt off face . use lens-pen , fine blower-brush . or wait until you've stepped under water it . put simply , it my experience if you keep your grubby paws off it , don't try ' clean ' it your cotton t-shirt/flannel shirt/etc , instead use methods used fine coated glass elements , it look like new forever . mine , it desert dust swamp mud . battery , fact , eventually lose energy ! normal use , you expect year or more battery . if you one those fellas shows everyone he meets his " neat digital compass " , or actually rely this your primary compass brush , it won't last nearly so long . digital compass primary energy-sucker , likely much backlight . use compass only when needed ( you should base-plate compass anyway ... suunto also makes some best these well ) . review stating watchbands give out , i find remarkable i never problem mine , i wear it constantly , day day out . all all , spite fact i return my first two , i heartily recommend vector . tough useful	1
this may ' outdoorsy ' ubergeek watch . it big , it ugly , but functions make fattest swiss army knife sit corner sobbing jealousy . overall , i like it but there couple things sound better than they . timepiece : outstanding . it hh : mm :ss dd: mmm , course , year setting avoid leap year issues . this should go without saying modern digital watch . stopwatch lap function ( not i ever use lap function , but i'm sure someone interested ) . countdown timer run up 24 hour countdown ( very easy set ) . three daily alarms . special kudos alarms , this one loudest watch alarms i've heard , i've missed too many watch alarms not appreciate this . altimeter : largely eye candy , but kind neat . over four days , my bedroom went 100m above sea level 25 below sea level ( maps , 40m asl ) . not surprising because it driven barometer , i never recalibrated it , but graphic demonstration importance calibrating it when you want/need i t.t he barometer : yup , it barometer . part i like little display shows rising/falling trend , especially this always active ( even normal ' time ' mode ) . thermometer : take watch off get accurate reading sensor too close wris t.t he compass : easily best ' special ' feature . accurate , precise ( enough orienteering , not surveying ) , easy use . it programmed declination , but knowing me , i'd forget reset it , so i declination hard way . sighting notches small but servicable . spirit level bubble unique among digital watch compasses suunto , greatly enhances accuracy confidence compass . outstanding wrist compass . package : big . really , really big . but controls very easy use seem fairly resistant accidental button pressing ( problem me other watches ) . battery shortish ( 12-18 month ) life , but hatch , so you don't need take it jeweller get it replaced without ruining water resistance . display large characters high contrast back ground , display light just right , readible , even , glare free , but not emergency flashlight . personally , i'm going swap resin band velcro strap , but stock strap isn't bad , just not great . overall , not watch office or suit but very good watch , compass barometer , what you could expect thermometer altimeter . well designed , thought-out , manufactured , but really big .	-1

although cathe friedrich well-known her more challenging , advanced workouts , " stretch max " equally suited both beginners advanced , very easy follow . divided into three roughly 20-minute stretch sessions , workouts either combined , divided seperate days after cardio or strength training session , or ' rest ' days . first part uses only mat , while second part uses stability ball , third uses resistance band . third session probably my favorite because using resistance band further helps achieving range-of-motion increasing flexibility . workout itself fluid seemless interweaving athletic stretches basic yoga poses , which allow exerciser modify according their own range-of-motion level flexibility . music also wonderfully compliments workout , which mostly mix new age , neo-classical light ' chill ' . i also thought pastel pink-and-brown outfits cathe other girls wearing so cute feminine - now i need find me one ! while frequent thorough stretching often overlooked , it essential part fitness which aids muscles faster recovery , helps protect injury maintaining youthful body .

i am knife collector , even bought several sharpening systems . this best . drawing blade proper angle across sharpening surface first important thing . spyderco makes easy because holder sets stones proper angle all you hold blade vertical draw it down across two sides . once you realize how easy getting edge you learn feel edge your finger tell which side edge minute burre overhang . then one gentle draw down side straighten burre you blade really sharp . cheaper steel knives not hold their edge long better ones . this sharpener it so easy even your cheaper knives almost useful , say kitchen because it so easy resharpen . this sharpener make you expert if you give it little practice . i even under sharpen some knives because they hold their edge better when it little thicker rather than " razor sharp " which thinner edge . thorough instructions explain how sharpen many different edges too like bread knives ( serrated ) , scissors , japanese blades ( one sided ) , fish hooks , etc .	1
all my knives used various levels " dull . " hopelessly dull knives left sitting drawer . after doing little bit research , i decided give spyderco shot . i'm very satisfied results . i am not trying compare my knife sharpening skills professionals results , but i say my knives much sharper cut very well now . dvd instructions very helpful got me up speed quickly . spyderco easy use it sets up quickly . i no longer excuse dull knife .	1

this light expensive even when bought discount but worth it opportunity it provides ride ( relatively ) safely night . i also use it working beneath my cars although it much better suited bike . i no problems whatsoever light so far . i initially thought i defective battery but not case . you need carefully follow instructions charging you may unplug charger plug it back occasionally .	1
ha . this most disgraceful weapon i yet encounter . sure mock suppressor sight laser good features , but gun weak , magazine holds meager 10 bbs . i very high standards , this gun met none them . it broke within 3 weeks purchase . but , it pretty good backyard gun , but it nothing compared pro-level airsoft pistols . should not used side arm pro-level airsoft battles ... good backyard fights though	-1
although i don't own this specific hoop , i owned lifetime hoop just like this one over ten years there nothing rusting or breaking off . only thing i replace net . even though it not biggest hoop breakaway rim , it would last much longer withstand decades use . if you're looking economic hoop beginner basketball player buy this hoop	1

yoga mats come three basic thicknesses . 1/8 " this mat average thickness . 24 " 68 " it also standard width length . mats half thick this one good travel or placing under thicker mat provide more traction . thick mats ( 3/16 " ) 50% thicker than this one designed those who need or want extra cushion . there two sides this nearly all yoga mats . look carefully ' bumps ' each side mat . larger bumps designed face upwards cushion your hands , feet , knees during poses while keeping your body dangerously slipping out alignment . smaller bumps designed face downwards grip floor keep yoga mat sliding . many mats label one end name brand . this typically , but not always , located ' up ' side . bumps tell you sure . this yoga mat increase softness stickiness use . ( so most mats . ) they start out mildly sticky increase stickiness more they used . you want wash your mat when it first arrives so remove thin film they get their surface during manufacturing process . instructions washing mat included . once you've washed dried your mat you're ready begin ! after using it while , if you find mat decreasing stickiness each time you pull it out , this typical sign light coating dust or too much body sweat accumulated your mat it needs light hand washing very diluted soap water . after washing , roll your mat thick towel squeeze out excess water , otherwise it take forever dry air . then , air dry your mat unrolled , inside , away sunlight . ( hanging over shower bar works nicely . ) when you first unroll your mat you find one end bit curled . simply alternate direction you roll your mat ( top outside once , then bottom outside next ) or end you start ( curled end once , flat end next time ) you'll find it straightening out more or less over time . i recommend buying your own yoga mat even if your yoga studio or gym provides them you . i've worked many studios gyms over years . sometimes management mats cleaned often , sometimes not . if you bring your own mat you always know where it . :o ) plus , owning your own mat may encourage you begin valuable practice home . my students who trouble their knees some poses requiring body weight rest knee , i recommend temporarily folding over one end mat get double cushion under knee while still leaving one layer under rest body . this saves you haul more than one mat out each time you practice which discouraging especially beginner .	1
i gotta tell ya , i little hesitant buying bike trainer . would i actualy use it or would it end up closet ? would it too loud like everyone saying ? well , i threw caution wind bought it ... it didn't hurt it under 100 bucks too ! i received bike trainer four days , it out box assembled 8 minutes working up sweat 15 minutes later . i love this thing !! reviews correct , if you've got mountain bike knobby tread tires , it loud ! i my ipod maxed out could still hear tire spinning . i determined though . i put street tire it like whole different machine - quiet smooth ... what workout ! this trainer awesome . money well spent	1
this thing pretty inexpensive what i got . it easy put together every piece included ! " wow ! " , i thought when i saw they didn't forget couple screws or bolts . this often happens me when i buy things i need put together . anyways , after doing everything i could this thing past couple weeks it still completely intact . it doesn't mind when i pull-ups , chin-ups , leg lifts , push-ups or when i hold onto bottom legs when i leg lifts floor . it move slightly when i dips but it not going anywhere . i weigh 155 lbs ., so this thing take some weight . i think limit 250 lbs . other than product tip-top i want mention amazon shipping . i ordered this early april , around 3rd if i remember correctly . i supposed get it tomorrow , 16th . i got it two days after i ordered it ! my dog started barking i thinking , " what wrong her ? " . last thing i expected see when i looked out window my ironman power tower . thanks amazon , ruling	1
power tower pretty straight forward piece equipment . there so many variations activities you it it fairly easy keep it interesting challenging . it pretty light weight piece , i move it around my own ease . i am also over 220 though unit flex when i use pull-up bar , it only so ever so slightly after initial experience checking unit out , it obvious maker designed it this way . bracing strategically placed allow this instead using much heavier materials . i appreciate this concept since it allows me move unit when necessary still gives me complete confidence integrity piece . just check your bolts periodically , any piece fitness equipment . push-up handles only drawback this sole reason i give it 4 instead 5 stars . only usable position me bend where there no padding . this places you fairly extreme angle although it still functional position , it obvious these not well thought out . any attempt even remotely place your hands where padding or any normal position you banging your head lower center brace . separate push-up bars better anyway . check out " perfect push-up " bodyrev here amazon if you're looking . all said , this infinitely usable piece equipment bringing some " big " exercises your home very reasonably sized package . it easy incorporate into your work-out routine even my wife taken liking it . she uses it work out her lower back loves strength/relief it gives her . bottom line , $100 this highly functional piece absolute bargain pretty much no brainer . get it .	-1
whole sword very nice . if your bleach fan you love it . even if you arnt this sword awesome . sheeth this little dot design it though you cant see picture though	1
its good scope , dont buy $6 or $10 scopes , your better off buying this scope . note : if you buying airsoft sniper off this site(amazon) -- none scopes work or attach sniper/rifile you buy accept this one . i highly recommend it	1
this wheel very easy assemble . it important use some type lubricant slide hand grips . first , i tried slide one without it because i afraid lubricant would make hand grips slide around during use after i put it together . hand grip would only go part way i difficulty getting it back off . so , i followed advice reviewer used tiny bit petroleum jelly . hand grips slid right wheel worked grea t.t he wheel very stable works it should . what more could you ask ? this very well-made exercise wheel great price	1
this stuff really good upper abs . first it unbearably hard but time i got used it now it every morning . its cheap easy use anywhere . all you need floor . one more thing , my gf unable more than one because lack upper body strength . other than , its awesome !	1

this great first scooter . non-skid surface makes it hard little ones slip while they scooting , but if they it surely scrape knees it very rough . it very quick easy assemble . it comes some stickers it don't stick very well but still unbeatable value $7.99	-1
bought this amazon our two girls . got it great price free shipping . i don't believe there actually any bearings wheels , but they turn ;) style very cute nice built-in grip . girls got our money worth first day riding it	-1
i've using this water filter system three years now . it light easy use . including setup , i fill 4-5 nalgene bottles 10 minutes or so , without my arms getting fed up repetitive motion pumping . it attaches easily wide-mouth nalgene bottle , so i'd recommend couple those if you don't them already . like any other filter , it gets slower use , so take care it . get silt stopper sure carry replacement filter any extended trip . i found some locations ( isle royale example ) i spent lot more time backwashing silt stopper filter took beating . our camp neighbors even more trouble their filters ( different brand ) , so i didn't feel too bad my minor troubles . replacement filters aren't cheap , but then neither any alternative filters out there . cleaning brush easy use but doesn't seem help much improving flow speed filter slows down . unit responds well cleaned up when you get home stored broken down .	-1
i purchased this wheeled duffle bag gift friend . so i personally cannot review its use . however , i chance look it before wrapping it . this appears quality made . bag defintely heavier than it appears . not point it would difficult use , but rather last longer . bottom bag not collapsible , which would give it more strength carry soda cans . i bought this item sale , i felt i got really good bargain . it well worth money . my friend not given any complaints its use so far	-1
good service , fast perfect condition amazing i love this produc t.t hank you , thank you	1

ahhh , ridicule i get writing few pogo stick reviews ... but these things really fun . i find best pogo stick reviews discussions found xpogo website forum . you'll find comments people who tested all pogo sticks provided honest , critical feedback . so take look recent reviews xpogo before buying any pogo stick . i own flybar 1200 , which i love ( see my review ) . if i market pogo stick , i'd check out vurtego , motostik , power pogo products , among others . xpogo , there long thread flybar 800 , reasonable reviews starting around sept 20 , 2006 . 800 seems great if you under 120-135 lbs . i'm bit over , which means it isn't me , unfortunately . 800 smaller lighter than flybar 1200 , which reportedly makes it more controllable . there problem surgical-tubing-like bands ( " thrusters " ) breaking which may under control . flybar ( sbi ) offers remarkably good customer service , so they likely address any problems you . keep mind pogo sticks changed since old days . new technologies actually kind've interesting . motostik spring , reminiscent master gg sticks old days . it pretty quiet , which might plus . fb 1200 800 use elastomere " thrusters " provide sling-shot like bounce . vurtego power pogo products feel bit like rubber ball bouncing . you adjust them if you inflating ball . so if you want drop big $$ pogo stick , take look what out there . there very , very good chance you'll choose flybar , but aware your options . i think pogo stick renaissance just around corner . , i think it might good kids bounce around these things because all those heel strikes might affect calcium levels actually strengthen bones . there research linking heel strikes calcium levels bone strength . if these results hold up , then pogo sticking child teen may offer lifelong health benefits .	1

i lift 3 times week . this my second pair harbinger gloves . last pair i lasted me 5 years so i sold harbinger quality . harbinger also fits me better than some gloves . basically , i don't fat hands , but i fairly long fingers . addition fit quality , i looking additional finger protection wrist wrap protection , which these glove . gloves washable leather . i not washed this pair yet , but my previous pair washed several times no ill effects gloves or other items laundry . everything these gloves great . i especially like extended finger coverage , which goes past lowest knuckle me up midpoint before next knuckle . i used tape there but no longer . only minor downside big grip feature , which imbedded rubber pads palm fingers . rubber takes few sessions break , so meantime , it not very flexible . it most noticeable curls , where additional bulk rubber prevented me closing my fist much around bar . one rubber pads also digging into my finger few sessions , but i adjusted my grip since subsided . if this big issue , then i would recommend going gel padded harbinger gloves rather than rubber padded ones . i would definitely buy these again , definitely some loyalty harbinger gloves	1

revised 22 feb 2007 . i looking high-end machete when i ran across this little sword united cutlery ( uc ) cabela catalog , where it sold " slimline machete , " not " ninja sword . " it ground single piece 420 j2 stainless steel nylon cord wrapped around hilt . this choice steel questionable any blade over 12 inches . if it heat treated hardness adequate edge retention , it tends brittle , resulting chipping edge or even catastrophic failure . if it not heat treated , it tends too soft really hold sharp edge . still , i heard this piece put hard use never heard one breaking . it may it just short enough get away using 420 stainless . i suppose it all hea t-t reat , without rockwell testing , followed torture testing , i'll never know what this thing can't . it reasonably sharp out box tuned up few swipes carbide sharpener . tang stamp says " hand made , " finish very good . i've heard complaints loose handle wraps , but i haven't problem despite handling sword quite bit . but it machete or " ninja sword ? " well , it sure isn't machete . it really resemble short japanese sword more than anything . rather , it resembles longer version americanized " tanto " -style knives become so popular " tactical " market . granted , i heard people going into woods clearing brush this thing , but i think it would tiring , when it comes swinging sharp metal object , tiring equals dangerous . if you want brush-clearing tool fifty bucks or less , there many choices : ubiquitous ontario meyerco machetes , woodsman pal , crocodile knives no . 227 , various machetes field knives condor , pile inexpensive offerings cold steel , name few . then there dedicated gardening tools like ditch banks weed knives . there no reason clear brush americanized japanese short sword unless you really want . sword , however , it handles nicely . it solid lively hand , nimble thrusting , cutting , chopping . i've made mess many cardboard boxes it . again , i don't know how it would hold up if bashed repeatedly into masonry or body armor , but otherwise , it makes expedient weapon close quarters . so short sword what it . sword clicks positively into included kydex scabbard , which light flat allows several different modes carry . i wish i could find machete this price came such nice sheath . i numerous clubs , axes , knives , swords , sword-like objects around house , some high quality commensurate price , but it this el cheapo sword leans against headboard my bed , it first thing my right hand touch emergency . ( i'd much rather grab paul chen practical wakizashi , but belongs my wife . ) , i suppose , testimony its design execution , which just well suited fighting tight spaces anything out there . grip could fill hand better , those lines , i'm thinking wrapping handle some leather grip tape . remaining question : blade this size , made stainless steel , both hold edge stay one piece ? come spring , i'm taking this thing into woods find out	-1

these cushions recommended me physician , but one medical specialty doesn't involve treating feet or orthopedic problems . this product well designed manufactured , i like support comfort it provides substantially better than four or five different types so-called " orthotic " cushioning/support products ( e.g. , dr. scholl ) i bought over-the-counter pharmacies grocery stores . " gellin '" may fine most folks , but slightly squishy insoles just don't cut mustard , nor ordinary rubbery-plastic inserts . my subjective , anecdotal impression , however , viscospot cushions indeed lessened pain inflammation i otherwise would likely suffered while walking or my feet long periods . anyone this condition knows hard step-down result searing , stumble-inducing pain . these cushions significantly lessen shock , compared either using no device or other cushions/devices i've tried . but these cushions not yet " cured " or substantially improved my plantar faciitis , despite month use now . ( my symptoms date back four months . ) i don't know how these may compare prescription " orthotic " devices custom fitted foot doctors . i've trying cure my problem " cheap , " but i've ended up spending $200 so far various stretching exercise products , various cushions . maybe i should bitten bullet seen specialist doc begin , i dunno .	-1
well , i this nissan bento over 5 years now . adult , i say i no problems it keeping food hot . i find it very comparable , even better than zojirushi mr. bento . i like my food hot , entirely stainless steel , it keeps all 4 containers hotter than mr. bento . top 2 containers mr. bento tend cool ( room temperature ) after 4 hours or more , while nissan , they usually more than warm ( but not steaming ) . make sure i am comparing correctly , i preheat 4 containers hot water before i pack , just like mr. bento . also , construction this bento much more sturdier than mr. bento , which lot plastic . like other reviewer , yes it dent if it gets banged around . adult , i don't any problem it . also mr. bento i got amazon xmas 2006 , made thailand , not japan . apparently it too expensive get it japan now or something like . my girl friend mr. bento made japan , it much sturdier , kept food hotter . i think new mr. bentos plastic lid , which allows heat escape . anyway , i just sold mr. bento ebay , kept lunch bag , which fits nissan thermos really well . i love this nissan thermos lunch tote . it really worth money	1

i my blackburn delphi 6.0 six months put thousands miles tens thousands feet vertical gain . i upgraded older vetta model . since i lot climbing vertical gain percent grade features major attraction me . operations all delphi computers simulated detail excellent interactive program blackburn website . this major selling point . i could " use " computer before i bought it . it eliminated unexpected surprises -- i knew exactly what i getting . ability utilize customer service , if needed , also important me . vdo , example , german company no u.s. offices . they germany customer service telephone number you call , but they only speak german . this might change future , but this case time i made purchase . i am 45 years old . i raced when i college but now ride fitness enjoyment . i don't ride fast but regularly climb 3,000 4,000 feet single ride each weekend . i not looking " performance " computer , rather just something keep track basics important me : speed , vertical gain , distance , % grade . end , i not use some advanced features such laps heart rate . - i found computer relatively easy set up learn . it fairly easy navigate while riding . i won't spend too much time navigation because every one their own like dislikes . go blackburn website navigate interactive program yourself . suffice say , general , i am satisfied operation unit . - wireless transmitter cadence sensor attach zip-ties . i found this unsightly . clamps i used vetta cateye products much nicer . however , i suppose it difficult provide clamp accomodate such large variety tube diameters . but this could accomplished shims it handlebar mounting bracket . however , this not reason not buy this product . i not problem mounting cadence magnet . although it toward end crankarm it not near pedal spindle . every bike different . cadence wire indeed long ( better than too short ) but i just bundled up extra zip-tied it little chainstay brace located tire bottom bracket . - speaking wireless transmitter ... coming wired system i wasn't sure i'd like wireless transmitter , but i . reception computer excellent even though i it right side handlebars transmitter left fork . - altimeter feature great . it why i bought this model . it works measuring barometric pressure resolution 3 feet . however , barometric pressure changes day day so " home " altitude measured computer . calibrating home altitude each time became annoying . but i thought it , i realized i really don't care altitude ... i just wanted know change altitude expressed total vertical gain . so now i just zero vertical gain go ! - vertical gain % grade feature wonderful knowing more road you . i am training century ride almost 10,000 feet climbing grades much 20% . these features help me know if i am training properly . my experience , vertical gain measurement accuracy +/- 5% . occasionally i'll see measurements much +/- 10% .. this definitely within tolerance most electronic instruments i'm sure slight variations barometric pressure start finish your ride contibute difference . my point this device give you very close vertical gain measurement but it won't exact . current technology limitations but it far better than not this measurement all . important point this device measures all vertical gain . there units market not measure gains less than 30 feet . i think bad idea . example , if you riding century rolling topography within each mile there two 25 foot rises ( reasonable scenario ) , there would 5,000 feet unrecorded vertical gain ! i appreciate blackburn unit records all vertical gain . - computer calculates gradient measuring distance traveled altitude gained . necessity , there lag display % grade ( it updated every 5 seconds using data measured over prior 20 seconds ) . this annoying ( but necessary ) because you want know what grade right instant you feel your legs strain . this feature finicky . you find reading fluctuates noticably you climb ( more grade , more fluctuation ) . i speculate this because two reasons : first , roads never rise straight line -- they wavy . second , steeper grade more riders tend not ride straight line . they wiggle off left then right . this affect distance traveled hence affect % grade measurement . main point this device give you good ballpark measurement . don't expect it exact . but again , it far better than not measurement all . small side note , % grade pegs out 20% . there small number riders out there ride roads gradients exceeding 20% it would nice if it could measured . - distance measurement , when programmed correct wheel size , seems accurate within few hundreths mile ( verified gps unit ) . - i not used heart rate moniter , but my wife . it operation straightforward seems work fine . she comfirmed presence " spikes " mentioned earlier review . - computer seems durable . i accidentally dropped it onto garage floor couple times it still works fine . - during one ride i caught rainstorm two hours . toward end ride i noticed display would not respond commands . closer inspection home revealed water gotten into unit . this not surprise rain heavy water once gotten into my old vetta unit ( which eventually dried out recovered ) . although i figured unit would eventually recover , it still unnerving because you can't so sure . owner manual says if this happens contact customer support . i emailed them my story three days ( i wish it more quicky ) i received reply . remedy remove battery cover let it dry out . blackburn wouldn't say whether or not water would ruin computer , but it turns out unit recover only needing new battery . if you ride rain regular basis you might want consider protecting computer water . this story also reinforces need consider customer service when deciding product . while waiting my delphi dry out i consider unit ruined i might buy one . i actually looked other companies their different models again see if i might more satisfied something else . i came conclusion i would buy delphi 6.0 . this greatest compliment i give this product	-1

i truly like this platform . i owned rebok step platform years i thought highly but i gave it friend bought firm fanny lifter ( blue purple one ) save space . while fanny lifter great ( - i still use it leg presses , lunges other strength building exercises ) , it not stable enough step workouts i like . i some cathe friedrich christi taylor workouts you need able some travelling get most out routines . also , it more stable my less than level 100 year old wood floors than my rebok platform . i would recommend investing this platform anyone use it . if you new stepping , perhaps try class few times before spending money or try less expensive , shorter version . i seen it $20-$25 discount chains . personally , i step training 20 years ( i'm 41 ) different impact levels no problems . higher impact i train 6 " level lower impact 8 " . my 9 year old cocker spaniel also uses it get off bed .	1

4x32mm range estimating a.o. full size master sniper scope far best scope you mount airsoft rifle , or even submachine gun . lets face facts , most airsoft guns no purpose scope them , they don't go far or accurate hunting rifle or other rifle . but this mind , this scope best because , airsoft why spend 50 dollars or more scope ? really cheap scopes , they break or don't even fit gun , expensive ones , they same this scope . this scope easy mount easy use . if you never used scope before , dialing it or zeroing come really easy , no tool or anything needed dial , except mounting scope gun , it actually easy mount without tool . scope designed capture light through it , when it pitch dark outside , when you look thought scope , it looks like it beginning get dark outside . there also sun cap allows less sun block your view . all all this perfect scope airsoft . guns i would recommend mounted scope too : 1 ) . utg m40a1 master sniper rifle2 ) . utg ak-47 tactical " warhawk " assault rifle3 ) . utg desert camo and/or olive green m324s sniper rifle4 ) . cqb navy seals utg mp5 a4/a5 submachine gun .	1

i recieved this product 3 weeks ago am impressed how it works . i used above average wrestler highly competitive state iowa , so over years i learned many pushup workout techniques keep body fit strong . i used treat my body hobby , using pushups dumbbells my main source lifting staying shape . over past year , i've put little weight lost some tone just like quite few people once final years school , careers , family consume majority your time . recently , i am looking get back old form . i saw perfect pushup television intrigued equipment . i also little research via internet see what information i could find product . i wondered how doing pushups perfect pushup compared doing pushups normally , wondered whether i could get into shape faster them whether they worked . i tell difference results perfect pushup doing normal , flat floor pushups . so far i am pleased . getting acclimated twisting motion perfect pushup probably hardest part , especially if you used doing pushups flat floor . but , after couple sets twisting motion becomes natural movement . doing pushups perfect pushup tends little difficult first week because twisting movement really targets whole upper body some your abs . i felt little soreness few hours after doing set twenty . first week , fight through soreness realize pushups using perfect pushup little tougher . try going back normal , flat floor pushups you'll amazed how many you . you feel like you 100 before getting burn . i haven't vigorous workout perfect pushup yet because busy schedule , but i try use them 5-10 minutes night . so far , everyone else i see i look thinner more toned . i think i look more toned my chest upper abs so i am excited develop more routine workout lasts 30 45 minutes much like i used wrestler see how fast i see results . i'm so impressed this product i recommend it everyone including friends family . some friends stopped house saw them lying floor . course like lot people they think it workout fad until they try it . i few friends live die weight room . they teased me bit then became pretty impressed once they decided set pushups . burn muscle fatigue comes quicker than most expect meaning perfect pushup works even those accustomed working out regular basis . one thing really impresses me how easy perfect pushup allows you isolate arms chest muscles ease doing one-handed pushups .	1
i little hesitant order arrival after reading some feedback but product arrived time ( after 9 days stated ) quality surpasses my expectations . materials construction very sturdy , right down workout poster , made heavy grade glossed paper , accompanies perfect pushup . perfect pushup itself great . while regular pushups put strain wrists due angle , this product eliminates problem allows your arms rotate naturally , reducing stress muscles forced work unnatural motion . they more difficult than regular pushups because factor stabilization involved allow you extend motion beyond your chest touching floor regular pushups . workout poster pretty basic so if you want more creative workouts beyond narrow , wide , regular pushups pickup available dvd . construction seems able last lifetime . i'm very happy this product	1

give little background how i'm comparing this workout , i following other cathe workouts : power hour , ctx kickbox , rhythmic step , entire intensity series , terminator , kick punch crunch , timesaver , low max , kick max , muscle max low impact circuit . hands down , this my absolute favorite workout . i think what takes cake me music . it not * just * 80 music , either - it remixed techno versions it , since i'm huge fan techno going out clubbing dancing my heart out techno , it small wonder i find this workout so enjoyable . step routines total kick . i'm not sure exactly how recommend this workout far those new cathe workouts goes . i think choreography easy follow , but then i've doing cathe workouts now around four years , so i've lot practice ( i used not able make it through even warmup rhythmic step once upon time ago . ) basically , my recommendation if you can't figure out step routines , just take your time keep trying . i can't comment too much weighted portion this workout - i tend pop this one utilize all cardio segments , including bonus cardio track end my cardio days . i plan this workout occasionally my weights days weekend when i know i dedicate whole hour half workout , i tell you i am wiped out end when i entire thing . best best best cathe workout so far , though ! love it . i hope cathe put together more jewels like this . i think it also helps she definitely very happy mood when she doing any workouts series this dvd came out . her hardcore series , she just doesn't seem quite so happy - more like she worn out , so it puts completely different mood workout . get this dvd ! it fantastic	1

i'm 43 this nothing like weak pogo stick my little brother when i kid . i surprised everyone family ( even myself ) when i ordered it . when it arrived , i discovered i gravity games version , which i think looks better because it isn't red . it fully assembled , too . spring so stiff , i afraid get it first but i took it my little brother house we blast it . you won't catch me doing any extreme tricks my age , but it plenty fun just bounce around try stay bouncing . indoors , i use it exerciser just trying balance it . it quite workout . don't let stiff spring intimidate you , once you start bouncing , you appreciate it . i've already so much fun this pogo stick , it paid itself first day . ( looks people faces when they see grown man bouncing pogo stick make it even more fun . ) it well constructed i expect it last long time . but like i said , i won't doing any extreme tricks it . if you try hard enough , you break just anything . if you get too crazy it or don't pay attention what you doing , you hurt yourself too . i get enough rush just taking it easy	1

cyclists recognize headlights roughly placed into two categories : ( 1 ) " see " lights provide sufficient illumination actually see where you going avoid obstacles , ( 2 ) " see me " lights really only seen front . i commute hid light much brighter than this one , but i like backup light , also like flashing helmet mounted light i point any direction get attention motorists , particularly those approaching me side . princeton tec light one few led lights i've enountered truly qualifies ( albiet , barely ) " see " light . highest setting , it produces very well collimated beam just right intensity width make it suitable night riding reasonable speeds . light less suitable medium setting , unsuitable purpose lowest setting . i same gripes kent this light . ( 1 ) it should designed use aa batteries . if it made use aa batteries instead aaa batteries , light would only marginally larger heavier , but burn time would greatly extended ... enough make it suitable ultra cycling events . ( 2 ) duty cycle " flash " mode too low . light would far more visible if flash rate increased least factor two or three . those complaints aren't knock effectiveness light itself . just suggestions improvments could make great light even better	1

i've bongo board few days now am very happy so far . very solid construction ! one great feature axis roller stays connected board stretchy cord runs length bottom board . this prevents roller dangerously flying off across room if you lose your balance . ( i seen other balance boards where roller not connected this could very dangerous , since it could fly off break something inside your home . ) roller stopped either end board two trucks so it won't roll completely out under you . it very difficult first ! beginners definitely need some chairs or something hang onto , or spotter . my friend who long time skateboarder tried it thought it also pretty tricky balance - it different feeling skateboarding . it comes booklet describing right ' form ' suggested ways use board some tricks learn once you get advanced .	-1

this hard nylon version yawara stick . there used some impressive versions these market , but now there this one two others , one aluminum one wooden , both functional but rather less inspired . more common pocket stick kubotan , which just shorter , skinnier yawara stick , usually configured keyring . kubotans come many shapes materials . don rearic * writes , you think pocket stick knife , but two differences : you thrust , but not cut ; you target bony areas . also , extent poking holes people bad legal hygiene , stick safer than knife . you strike " pommel " yawara hammer blow or " point " reverse hammer blow or even sort rapier thrust , bracing tip thumb . you also use it trap or lock joints , if you know what you're doing . anything you hit even moderately hard going hurt . this thing break bone , pulverize muscle , shock nerves , all without skinning or fracturing your knuckles . yes , product description says it non-lethal , but if you whack someone head it , you could kill him . " just " breaking someone bones no joke , either . before you try it out friend or foe , everyone favor take few whacks piece 3/4 " plywood . this should give you some respect what this tool . unlike many weapons , yawara stick won't extend your striking range . you get up close personal whatever you're hitting , which usually means it hit you . if you're too timid close range , pocket stick probably won't you lot good . this thing like big , indestructible knuckles each end your hand . highly recommended . * please use google more info , amazon doesn't allow offsite hyperlinking .	1

excellent quality ; much easier put than cap i used before	1
i'm my 5th cap now i think . silicone great lasts forever . unlike rubber ( which snag hair ) latex ( which some people allergic ) silicone fits smoothly over wet hair , glossy finish so it looks great doesn't lose elasticity . i some advice if you want try this product i've learned overt years : 1 . always rinse hang dry . i've left wet caps my gym bag after month two neglect , it develops black spots . i don't know if it mold , it doesn't wash off ... you'll buy new cap if you don't like spotted look . 2 . pull it gently . i've ripped one when i trying stretch it over my head because my long nails cut right through it . it not cloth so you careful . this goes latex rubber , too . 3 . wet your hair first . if your hair dry when you put it , you trap air under cap . since it not permeable material , cap start come off while you swim because air trying escape inside . 4 . pick fun color . that it . great swim	1

i doubt these shoes because friends shaolin who swore these shoes i wanted shoes use capoeira . well , grooves bottom shoes make it very difficult slide your feet backwards or spin ball your foot because insanely large amount friction so it no good me capoeira but obviously they weren't made . there incrdibly large range friction so if you need keep your feet ground these shoes definetly you . also - these shoes insanely comfortable . since i've bought these , i wear them nearly every opportunity i . they're light , padding bottom perfect your feet first time you put them last . stylish . only drawback them would if you any need slide your feet backwards or rotate your feet it may difficult - but , other than its wonderful shoe	-1
i got this week ago . assembly pretty easy , took less than hour . only problem i one pins hold uprights place some stripped threads . i called customer service number they sent me two replacements which i received within week . bench press : bench four positions : flat , decline , two incline . uprights adjustable four different heights . bottom part seat also adjustable flat or two different incline positions . while doing incline bench presses higher two incline positions , it nice put lower part seat up it highest incline position , it holds you place so you don't slide downwards while doing your reps . there also pair extra barbell holders located lower down uprights ; if you can't finish rep , you dump bar there . bar come rest inch above your chin , so you don't lift it very far get it there . that really nice safety feature . overall , it very comfortable works great any sort bench press , incline decline or flat . there nothing gets way , uprights adjustable get bar right height , bench really solid feel it . i use 6 ' standard bar , which works fine . course 7 ' bar would work well . squat rack : you use this bench squat rack . lower bar holds uprights together curved , so you stand them . you just flip bench forward ( it stays straight up position ) . then you raise uprights high they go turn them around backwards so they're facing correct direction . they're tubular , so you just take pins out turn them around . ideally , uprights could go up little higher , you squat down somewhat order get under bar . but , you're doing squats anyway so what point complaining you extra 1/5th rep. besides , it infinitely better than picking weight up off floor . leg attachment : this removable , which nice because it not way when you're not using it . it two different heights , i found lower one best leg curls , upper one better leg extensions . if you try using leg curl attachment upper height , padded bar wants roll up your legs you exercise . lower position , there no problem . padding bars very thick comfortable . leg extensions , bar goes right across front your ankles stays there throughout exercise . same leg curls - once i got it right height , it stays same place your legs throughout exercise , no rolling back forth . bar holds barbell plates 1 " diameter , there adapter sleeve included olympic plates ( 2 " diameter ) . preacher curl bench : this goes same place leg attachment . i originally thought there problem barbell holder which sticks out front this , it wouldn't allow me get full extension bottom movement . but i found if you move forward seat so your legs under preacher bench , middle your biceps even top bench , it works just fine . there no interference barbell holder all . even though barbell holder only few inches wide , bar balances just fine it , it handy feature . overall , i can't find anything complain this bench . after little experimenting around find correct position when using preacher curl bench , which height leg attachment needs leg curl work correctly , everything works fine . bench nice solid , padding seat thick firm . replacement part i needed received quickly , no charge , no questions asked . i'm really happy this purchase .	1
gloves tight , solid feel , made good materials . manufacturer describes new feature , " innovative curved finger design offers natural , flexible comfortable fit " . sounds good , but not add any real comfort glove . you still excess padding when making fist makes it more difficult grab bar . pros : solid feel ; good padding ; good materials , overall design craftsmanship ; " no sweat " wicking system seems work there no dark residue left hands after workout , which not case most manufacturers using cheaper materials . cons : excess inner padding affecting grip ; no " easy-off " feature offered many other manufacturers ; wrist wrap takes some tweaking comfortable	-1

i initially purchased velocity spin bike because its lower price ( $150 less ) , but after few weeks buyer remorse , it back bike shop exchange it schwinn ic elite . this bike offers amazingly smooth stable ride , which well worth extra money . i also appreciate its extra features . i've only use emergency brake twice , but both times i happy it . just check specs other indoor cycles , you'll amazed how many not offer standard emergency breaking feature . when you're spinning 25-40 pound fly wheel , you really need ability make sudden stops event emergency . additional water holder great , because i always drink least 2 while riding , i don't want stop mid-ride reach drink . many indoor cycles offer only one ( if any ) aren't built accommodate add-on holders . i ride using adjustable foot harnesses which comfortable sturdy . i haven't used toe clips this model . it comfortable bike overall , but i question 4'11 " " compatible user size . " i'm 5'3 " could use additional half inch forward adjustment . however , i've found i compensate using handlebar center protrusion when riding neutral position . shorter users should probably give bike in-store test run make sure it won't cause neck , shoulder , arm or back strain . specs also state it compatible users up 6'8 " . my husband 6'8 " he able ride very comfortably without straining his back or knees . saddle okay its own , but i prefer using gel cushion cover added comfort . seat width standard , so it easy find suitable cover . after 3 years use , my schwinn held up perfectly , without needing serviced . it great product . highly recommended	1

i gave up trying find watch both compass thermometer , since none temperature watches seemed work well ( according all reviews ) . i then looked only watches compasses , plus usual set timers alarms stuff . enduro seemed best combination cost value . my first day it , i driving unfamiliar city night poorly marked road compass helped me determine i going right direction . ( soon afterwards , i found route sign . ) i since used it kayaking orient our group , so feature seems work fine . rest features easy use any watch i i doubt i am using them their full advantage . also , it easy read i think it one more stylish this type watch . so ... i feel like i got more than my money worth here . note i watch only one month now , so time ( sorry ) tell . but , so far so good	1

other reviews mark - this great little light . i other lithium powered lights this one may not bright some them , but its so small i no excuse not always carry it . i only one bit personal experience add . i've found if you turn bezel just past where it goes off ( maybe 1/8 turn past ) you operate light one handed just like tactical light - hold front light inside curled finger press back your thumb momentary operation . this may unique my particular unit , so ymmv	1
i believe zippo pocket handwarmer made same japanese company makes " peacock " - hakkin company japan . hole pattern top zippo warmer hole patterm similar chimney zippo lighter . peacock hole pattern shaped like peacock , more elegant . zippo filler flask ok , but one supplied peacock superior . it funnel valve fits fill area unit . when funnel rotated 90 degrees , valve opens fluid inserted no spillage . not so zippo filler flask . bag peacock drawstring closure , where zippo uses velcro . zippo bag big zippo label it , where peacock not more formal ( i prefer simpler style ) . zippo bag black , while peacock bag green ( shows less pocket lint than black)the burners -- both units share same burner - which hakkin offers individually . however zippo burner stamped " zippo " base unit huge " zippo " . quality peacock zippo superior jon-e . similar price units , get peacock . zippo close second due cosmetics accessories . also , any brand lighter fuel used ( you don't use zippo fuel )	-1
compared other " similar " warmers i used past , this device shows typical zippo quality attention detail . easy fill , using included measuring device half- or full-day warmth . easy light , color-change heat detector cap verify ignition . , just advertised , produces abundant warmth hours . no leaks , no problems , just heat . my wife loves it her hands even tucks it into small her back when she extra chilly . highly recommended	1
there aren't many exercise routines i without getting bored or hurt ( bad knees ) but rowing reasonably low impact but great all-around . this machine great value given its variable levels magnetic-assist resistance top basic air resistance . it folds up nicely when you need floor space , runs smooth , isn't too noisy . best all , it got this lazy-bones back exercising regularly , after one month , i already feel difference	1
i found this product good solution what i needed it -- carry my families ski up slopes . there not lot noise wind aerodynamic issues , even high speeds . it holds skis firmly place , very easy use open button close snap . although it may not made metal , it sturdy enough nothing moves i t.t his far better option several other systems i found , which offered too many parts not whole lot value price they wanted . factory installed ski rack which would cost $300 roughly same size not good deal this rack my 2000 dodge durango . response previous two reviews , i must note few corrections . firstly , rack hold two snowboards , i tested it two my friends snowboards my last trip . order them fit , one must face down other face up , one top other . individual who posted it not obviously didn't think try stacking them . second , response fact bar could simply twisted--you're joking right ? it would attract attention if individual attempted twist off bar . top , order them twist off bar , they would break board/skis rack process , would defeat purpose , would it not ? only problem i this fm1 adapter which required install this carrier my factory bars . instructions assembly didn't provide any information any vehicles besides imports . ( domestic cars out luck since this sweden based company !	-1

i finally caved bought transfirmer system 4 videos plus i bought jiggle free buns arms go it . i doing this program three weeks say i feel firmer indeed . i don't follow meal plan they suggest either almost lost one dress size my clothes fitting better . transfirmer system basically step system . if you step workouts past then you no difficulty becoming acclimated system . however , since this much higher step , you experience more muscle burn ( especially if adding weights ) . interlocking two " steps " keeps transfirmer sliding around during lunges - like my old step . someone else mentioned , this very sturdy piece equipment i impressed quality it . you use it any step workou t.t he videos concentrate getting job borderline boring times . instructors don't offer perky motivational conversation or explanations how muscles targeted like kathy smith denise austin . this may plus though , because after repetitive use , kind chatty conversation become annoying . exercises heavy lunges squats without weights . they also offer modifications use until you build up your maximum level . these workouts refreshing because they mix match low-impact floorwork step training weight lifting . so you never get jittery feeling after jumping up down 45 minutes like other step workouts . one more plus these workouts not take alot space . i gave this sytem five stars because i think it offers great approach longterm fitness diet	1
i'm lover firm videos reason : they best out there . this series no exception . moves good , music great . only reason i didn't give this five stars because new transfirmer large somewhat difficult move into new positions . said , it no means reason not buy system . new box allows new moves stretch tone parts other boxes weren't able get . overall , it good purchase	-1

this machine more strider than elliptical . its advantage over tony little machine smaller footprint . nonetheless , it beats sitting front television . no variable resistance available . heart rate measured grips . exercise cannot performed without holding onto grips . readout gives calories , cadence speed . machine very quiet sturdy if you fit weight limit ( 200 lbs or less ) . i would not go higher this may wobble . it big advantage it folds easily fits under bed save space , unless you need clothes rack . not exactly advanced athelete but beginner or intermediate fitness fan . this more than fit bill . pros : pricequietstorablecons : lack resistancenot true ' elliptical motion'not advanced fitness afficianado or triathelet	-1

my opinion , this top quality solid bristle board seems true normal wear under our cricket matches . any dart player knows bull eye target all dart boards prone wear down first expose ring metal rendering board useless because bounce outs or dropouts . if i may add , if such company design dart board synthedic polymer or sometype small bullseye which gets hammered more than any other area board , concept might rectify problem premature wear any bristle dart board it regulation or amatuer . albeit , i like this board any dozen quality made dartboards i purchased past	-1
my wife i owned smooth ( keys fitness ) 5.15 treadmill over 2 years . we not owned treadmill , but before committing this one , we tested many other brands this price range . smooth brand definitely smoothest ride you get without paying significantly more . each us runs 2-5 miles daily , when maintained prescribed owners ' manual ( occasional lubrication belt realignment ) , 5.15 handles it easily . ride very comfortable , compared other treadmills running outdoors ) , we no doubt this treadmill would handle more vigorous running ease . we few problems 5.15 . within first year , some sof t-t ouch buttons control panel stopped working , circuit board replaced twice . this involved working 25 screws each time . then , year later , arm-mounted toggle switches stopped working . these small auxilliary switches incline speed levels , so they weren't vital . they easy replace without tools . then , two years , belt tore slightly seam , one edge . treadmill still usable , but loose piece belt smacked against plastic housing loudly each revolution . this wasn't terribly difficult replace , but it certainly wasn't fun , requiring disassembly entire platform . service notes : outside ' parts labor ' warranty period , when only parts covered , customers pay shipping parts keys fitness . most keys ' service technicians knowledgeable , perfectly willing guide you through long repair process , providing frank helpful advice way . today , 5.15 still works it when it new , over two years ago . nothing else diminished , nothing else shown wear . when things gone wrong , keys provided us good customer service . overall , we're happy our experience , we'll probably buy smooth treadmill next time .	-1

this boxing set good value compared if i would bought each item separately . however , you only really need boxing bag , gloves spinning thing attach it ceiling . other piece equipment you mount wall very large not really useful us . maybe it would someone else , but you just use spinning thing mount it beam use boxing bag way . other mounting wall bracket heavy takes up too much room . but i bought this whole set anyway because it cheaper buy all this together than buy it separately .. it good exercise !	-1

hi ! i just posted review same product ( but shipped amazon ) , i thought i'd copy review here your convenience . quick note though : one sold amazon free shipping so definitely take look . why i bought iti like workout 4-5 days week , but i live la it sometimes hard get gym if i work late or if there traffic . also , my neighborhood not so nice , so i prefer avoid jogging night . enter fitness quest integrity 3000 air rower . assemblyif you assemble ikea furniture or coffee table walmart , then you assemble rower . you put 4 pins , then hook strap rower bungie cord under seat . finito . far tools go ( despite what instructions say ) all you need two wrenches . use socket wrench ( $10 target or walmart ) you'll even faster . qualitythe rower surprisingly good quality price . it made two piece aluminum frame feels sturdy . first , i little skeptical chain connecting rower handle , because it looks really small cheap-o . but , after 30 minutes hard rowing , i could tell chain more than adequate . one reviewer target website said chain exploded into million pieces while she rowing . maybe she faulty chain ; who knows . all i know i row 150 pounds weight stack gym , but there no way i could shatter chain simply rowing . stress test , i even rowed hard i possibly could , rower fine . performancethe performance this thing really great . resistance level smoothness good cardio rower i use gym . this air rower , so resistance increases harder you pull . additionally , you increase resistance wrapping tension strap around its base one time before connecting it cord under seat . seat slides very easily , foot pads swivel allow your ankles little more freedom move . also , rower folds vertically easy storage . when it folded , rower 4 feet tall takes up 2 square feet floor space . it easily fits closet or corner . although , it too wide fit under bed . valuegreat value . my buddy rower costs twice much , difference hardly noticeable . performance great , if you buy amazon item you get it tax-free free super saver shipping . i looked couple other rowers ( mainly piston rowers ) nothing even came close this level quality performance price . issuesthe only negative thing i say it little noisy ; even air rower . ( those you who never used air rower , resistance created big fan which makes " whoosh , whoosh " sound when you row . ) noise isn't terrible , but it prevents you hearing tv or radio clearly ... even ear phones . summaryso all all , i think this fantastic value . quality great , performance fantastic . i highly recommend this product .	1

i am so happy my table . while i normally don't like upside down , i love feeling stretching my spine while i hang downwards . i not achieved 90 degree setting yet but i am confident i so . i use table first thing morning stretch after sleeping it makes me stand up , after i get off , like i ballet workout ; stomach relaxed , shoulders down , chest out relaxed . five minutes literally feels like i hour nap , so i this when i come home or lunchtime ( before eating ) if i am working home . i don't it after i eat . i never it full stomach , right after eating . i intermittent traction most time . when i get up full inversion 90 degrees , i plan try some those crunches , which said equivalent 10 regular crunches . warranty information teeter hang ups home-use inversion products backed full 5-year warranty . during period starting day retail purchase continuing 5 years , stl international , inc . extends original consumer purchaser warranty against defects materials , workmanship , fabrics , padding . note commercial use home equipment voids all warranties . teeter hang ups commercial line backed full 2-year warranty	1

people apparently not following ( or misunderstanding ) basic instructions , leading them believe pump doesn't work . here what it says box my similar airstrike 950 came in:' pump lever up position , tighten screw cap ensure proper seal . ' screw cap knobby appendage surrounding stem connector . pump lever opposite side , up position means move it away pump body . you must first move lever up then tighten screw cap order pump work . sure tighten it all way , until you encounter strong resistance . tightening cap applies pressure rubber sleeve inside , which causes it bulge inward form good fit around valve stem . if you make rubber sleeve too tight it won't fit over valve stem , only then should you loosen cap slightly until it fit . ' lock lever down position . ' pushing lever down applies final bit pressure rubber sleeve inside , creating airtight fit around valve stem . when you screw cap properly adjusted , lever offer some resistance you push it down , then it lock place against body . that it . now you use pump . when you're , flip lever away body remove pump . now we're over hurdle , good news pump it amazingly small light , it works great inflating sports balls , which main thing i bought it . only issue i've found it pretty hard generate high pressure pump . i'm reasonably strong , but am unable inflate bicycle racing tires their proper level using this . spite , i'm giving pump five stars here offset all those ratings people who just didn't use it correctly	1

received my door gym yesterday , it put all together 5 minutes , i up hanging . also worked great pushups . such poor directions , it took couple minutes figure out what bolts should go where , but once i , it cinch . those problems assembly , or considering purchasing door gym , here deal . hex head bolts installed vertically , where 90 degree bend tubes connect horizontal bar . use silver washers these . rounded bolt heads ones used attach plastic bar two 90 degree bend tubes together back , installed horizontally . use smaller black washers these . looking underneath rounded bolt head , you see it four-sided short length , not round . now , looking plastic bar pad , if you look holes where bolts go , you see they square opening . square part bolt pushed into square opening . if it not , you won't length necessary securely screw cap nut . this why several people issues it . great product , would even better if it easily understood , complete directions .	-1
after reading reviews , i wondered if i'd able assemble this product . it hard certain when half reviews say " completely worthless " , other half say " awesome product . " after speedy delivery karate depot , i satisfied . it took less than 10 minutes put together . screws , some reason , just barely long enough fit . there only two pairs screws , so if you try using wrong pair wrong holes , you're not going get anywhere ; included washers , there just barely enough room bolts . this not helped almost humorously poor instructions . perhaps these factors caused other reviewers disappointed ; or perhaps screws mispackaged their boxes actually too short . my case , i've product two months , around 75 pull-ups week , no problems whatsoever . once put together , product works great doors meet its specifications ( you see specs online , so check before you buy ! most standard doors work ) . i definitely recommend old sock or other added cushioning ; there not damage wall above door , but there occasional black streaks . these streaks removed easily cleaning product such magic eraser , so i'll accept them over other pull-up bars require drilling into door frame . i highly recommend this product . trust me , this thing put together used without coming down your head . i think pull-ups great exercise , i know no easier way them comfort your home .	1

this inexpensive machine when you get it you see why . still probably worth money if you actually use it while watching tv . people who essentially want machine show up weight come off might hate it might those who think feeling burn only way go but i think its best way burn 400 calories while watching single tv show without killing your back . you sustain zero resistance level twist hour straight break light sweat , lo level cardio . rate ( tummy toning cardio machine - which it excellent !!! ) you burn 7 9 calories per minute . i know this because i also own body bugg calorie management armband measured calories burned one hour work out . i loved it because its great way avoid just sitting there when you want watch tv . i've killed myself brutal kick boxing workout same calorie burn shorter time - this less stress back . i thought video demonstration i recommend only using it once see different exercises . workout video i give it negative 3 out 10 . absolutely best thing this isn't hard workout but it burn long term ( 45 minute hour ) calories . because i think its sustainable motivation- people who hate their workout machine not use them they end up garage . this my new tv chair	-1

pros : high pressure , very small , light weight , high qualitycons : heating , flimsy rubber holder frame connectorthis amazing pump , very small works really good . i other pumps before , but my racing bike i need put over 100psi air . no mini pump could go near 80psi . this one goes much 160psi according specs . when i tried it my bike , i could go over 100 easily . my tires take maximum 120psi , so i didn't try further . it neatly built , high quality material . barrel brushed aluminum , very narrow diameter . towards end pumping it gets warm , but it works like charm . thanks topeak ! if i lose i'd definitely buy again	1

this thing works . i won't make lot crazy claims , but i say this great starter device get your abdominal muscles working properly . my wife bought it i afraid it going typical tv gimmick . now i use it more than she . it seems tighten up strengthen whole range abdominals ( some parts back shoulders ) , making you more slender across midsection giving you strength gut-busting exercises if you want those crunches you feel you cannot right now . someone else pointed out , this really benefit if you already cardiovascular or fat-burning exercises but need trim concentrated areas . exercises like this don't remove fat ( cardio , etc ., -- consider doing them heart monitor guarantee consistent effort . ) they firm up muscles those areas instead hanging loosely looking flabby . what not ? ( i know this experience ) don't crunches weight . i built nice strong round belly way once ( thanks wrong advice , bally's!) if you made mistake , i hate say it , but you'll probably lay off abdominal exercises long time , then use this , add torso twisters ( very low weight ) lower back extensions , crunches ( without weight ) knee raises . you find ab slide torso twisters build your strength so you other exercises -- total maybe 10-15 minutes day . any exercise , take it easy first . don't extend all way until you've using it while . once you've using it week or so , you'll get feel how far you extend	1

first , interest full disclosure , i am writing this review under my husband " real name " because it his account . my husband i avid readers we often read bed before falling asleep . such , we've looked tried just every book light market . we initially found these lights chance costco , sitting themselves ( only package available ) top stack books . we tried them out they fantastic . most book lights one two features we liked , lot more we didn't . these just what we wanted . they lightweigh t.t hey very , very brigh t.t he battery easy change . light bulbs never needed replaced . they compact don't weigh down paperback . clip strong stays place . best all swivel . you direct these lights anywhere you need them , left/right , up/down , all around . plus you direct arm holds lights various angles . it perfect nigh t-t ime or car/air travel reading . someone said it hard find batteries lights . we've never problem . target walmart carry extensive supply ( i think they 2032 , we get duracell energizer brands they last long time ) . very easy replace , just unscrew back light pop them . i say first lights we got original two-pack costco ( we never seen them store again , it such fluke ) problem one two lights . one batteries always gets stuck next impossible remove . we end up unscrewing other half light where bulbs pushing battery out other side . this obviously not intended way change battery . however this never happened lights we've bought this company through amazon - only one one first two we got costco , i'm not even sure they made same people , although they look identical . since buying first two-pack , we've bought four more lights this company amazon . my husband i keep them various locations house , our travel bags , car , etc ., get constant use out them . they durable , long lasting . only one thing i complaint : claw-clip supposed open using thumb-press movement , but i find it difficult use . it easily worked around just opening it my fingers attaching it book . maybe i small hands , my husband doesn't this problem . it minor issue , though . finally , i love colors . pink , blue , purple especially . they just make you happy look , but maybe that just me . :	1
simple concept : hinged 5 iron club bends errors your swing . it require person comfortable enough actually hit 5 iron - which many high handicap golfers struggle hit well . those people who use hybrid 5 irons or greater , or defer 7 9 woods , this aid not you . if you developed your fundamentals " grooved your swing " through thousands balls numerous lessons , you not benefit . value club it used hit ball - note momentus cannot used hit ball . key difference here gives this training aid greater versatility . original takeaway , if you're not correct position , club break . every aspect your swing , if there flaw it found . most part , i found my faults initial takeaway when trying rush shot . i need it remind me get me back tempo when range . it excellent tool someone conventional golf swing either ' one plane ' or ' two plane ' method ( outlined jim hardy ) . regarding natural golf method , i cannot verify its benefi t.t his club reveal your faults immediately . i wouldn't recommend it novice without any experience or formal instruction or even beginner who hasn't consistency groove swing . it person who more consistent swing - one who isn't struggling get ball air or getting ' wormburners ' . just one week working this club , i found some fundamental faults plagued me . after few weeks , i developed confidence irons . obviously golfer swing composite various facets grip , alignment , stance , tempo , takeaway , backswing , transition , downswing , contact follow-through . if you find one aspect your swing fault , there likely domino effect require some other changes your technique . this tool not any way obviate solid practice or lesson golf professional - it complement it depending upon your style . club head small compared oversized game improvement clubs thin topline it profile muscleback more than cavity back iron . thus its sweetspot smaller than modern iron ' duffer ' like me ( i use ben hogan apex edge irons wider sole thicker topline ) . if you hit it correctly , it sail its intended target . i don't typically hit 5 iron very far but it goes 150-160 yards me . i highly recommend this club . it worthy consideration it excellent tool maintain proper swing plane tempo . no other device help tell you multitude flaws your swing may possess . it no wonder training aids come gone but this one still met test time . -i also reviewed medicus driver	1

great skateboard money . got this my " angel " christmas he seems love it . appeared sturdy good quality like any other skateboard	1
novice intermediate , this excellent set lifting straps . you don't need something like this beginning . but weight you're handling starts exceed your grip strength , this invaluable . use simple . you just wrap strap around bar . there no real technique it . you lift weight , weight itself pull strap tight transfer some load straps around your wrists . i don't recommend wrapping straps too tight , transfer almost all weight your wrists your forearms won't get usual amount workout . point complete lift without your grip failing , not avoiding using your grip altogether . if you it right , your grip supporting most weight beginning , you complete more reps your grips start fail , more more weight transfered straps . this simple , no frills strap . it works it priced very reasonably . padding little light , but it adequate unless you handling some herculean weight	1
other than not really knowing how size snorkel gear , 2 people , andi wasn't really interested paying dive shop prices . i also leaving mayan peninsula 7 days . i went shopping line . i didn't want rent gear , or use gear resor t.t he only issue i didn't/couldn't properly size gear . mask not fit my face or my girlfriends face well . we different shaped faces/headsbefore we go again , we spend money dive shop new masks . delivery came well before we left mexico . not deal all plastic packaging marketing garbage would normally come this class gear , wonderful . i think masks may work well kids .	-1

like chive , this knife nice small package that deceptively stabby . sure , it looks innocent , but how much blade you want your eye ? hypothetically speaking , course . i would never indicate you should stab people this knife . never ever . high points sleek design , flawless assisted opening , light weight . i problems thumb studs assisted opening knives , so i am very pleased this index opening . safety-conscious , there safety lock keep blade opening your pants . not it , but just case i guess . leek perfect knife people small hands ; i assisted opening definite bonus . too many assisted opening knives too bulky my hand , or too powerful when it snaps open ( kershaw tactical blur , example ) . leek firmly snaps into place without " recoil " light small enough people small hands easily use . but don't fooled its innocent appearance . this knife deadly little package should not underestimated	1
i'm not huge outdoorsman but wanted nice everyday pocket knife . kershaw leek fits bill . i love size , long enough get your whole hand envolved task yet small enough clipped your pocket forget its there . i planning taking clip off just letting knife " float " my pocket but fell love clip . only thing better than light weight your pocket no weight your pocket . i find knife well designed i really like speed safe opening action . it solid " click " lets you know knife locked position . super sharp perfect drop point blade .	1

we bought this month ago . it went together easily enough - took 1.5 2 hours - instructions clear . it very quiet ! i love ! resistance plenty us - we aren't workoutaholics don't overuse our equipment . if you serious biker want something stay shape , i would go one more expensive models . if you like us , work out 3-5 times week 30-45 minutes , then this perfect you . it adjusts plenty tall person . someone 6 feet tall should no problem . only three very minor complaints : 1 ) if you adjust length lot different users , it kind pain change , however , we it rug , hard floor this may not much issue . 2 ) if you get off it more than five minutes timer resets back zero . 3 ) seat cushioned , but still little hard ; i put extra cushion it . otherwise , we love it . it excellent value	-1
box it arrived badly damaged elliptical almost fell out bottom when we picked up box bring it inside . i surprised pieces weren't missing . i started put it together it took 45 minutes . directions easy follow , except nuts bolts , i guessed which ones they referring because there no guide tells you which one which . getting pedal bars base machine most difficult task . time i it put together i sweating . after assembly using it very simple it what elliptical should . i find right handle seems move little so i see if i tighten it little more . display went dead just few days but after putting some new non-generic batteries it seems working okay . it easy move around house doesn't take up lot space . when you it it doesn't move around like i read reviews other ellipticals . overall , now i it all put together display works , i am happy it	-1

i bought this bike rehab knee surgery . this price point i willing take chance buy it sight unseen . it works advertised i've incorporated it into my daily exercise routine . bike quiet when use ; i've used wind trainers before sound like cyclones compared this bike . i don't crank tv hear it while pedaling . tensioner 8 levels provides good spectrum wheel resistance . electronics controlling 6 exercise programs , timer , calories burned , distance traveled , pulse all work well . only minor negatives : 1 . setup instructions clear but hooking up tensioner unnecessarily difficult . took 20 minutes lot sweat . 2 . stabilizer bars ( front back ) just tad short , so there slight side-to-side movement you pedal . nothing serious . 3 . you exercise , lcd readout cycles through all stats ... would nice able select what data you monitor . overall i'm happy purchase , esp this price , recommend it others	-1
this unit works advertised . i mounted it using suction cups my windshield lower left hand corner , ran temp sensor cable foot over edge door frame get outside temperature . suction cups work well if you clean glass first . pros : easy setup good results . cons : temp gage too small read easily	-1

i garage full bikes i needed some organization badly . i saw this rack during search amazon it looked like just what i needed . when it arrived i immediately impressed materials construction : it very well made pieces feel substantial . all fasteners allen heads which quality touch . quality such i thought it must made usa ! but alas , after searching packaging carefully , i found elusive " made china " sticker . oh well , what isn't made china ? assembly went well all parts went together without much struggle . follow tip instructions leave all fasteners " loose " until assembly complete . when i got it together tightened all fasteners snugly i hung 4 bikes it it very stable . i say i am very satisfied this product feel comfortable recommending it others .	1
us special ops forces use this compass . this pretty indicative its reliability . i own this compass well silva ranger . they're both great compasses , but i prefer suunto ( spite fact suunto now makes silva compasses well ) . housing indeed easier turn suunto , which handy when you're shooting sight . romer scales base nice , although if you're serious you're probably already carrying transparent romer scale card ( that plastic graphic training aid thingy you take coordinates , all you lt . ' out there ) . when i backpack , i take this suunto well suunto gps plotter compass , working ( surprise ) my map gps . if romer scales baseplate really , really important you , you might look into compass well/or instead , it features more scales just accurate compass . all all , this ultimate baseplate compass , my opinion . i miles miles rifle-piloting us army behind me now hump hills pleasure ; land-navigation passion me . suunto makes tools i find most useful pursuit	1

ok , sword appearance pretty nice , it didn't dissapoint area . i suppose i'm not blind swordsman , so i can't really complain , but it sharp butter knife , possibly little more dull . sword fits scabbard well enough , but when sheathing it gets stuck end , you force it just right way , it not clean i'd like it . all petty nitpicking aside , it nice show piece , maybe little sharpening i could become blind samurai	-1
i bought this device primarily temperature feature , but guess what , it wasn't temperature , it degrees direction . despite my misunderstanding , it accurate . only drawback suction cups not work windshield . i keep it my glove compartment pull it out when i'm lost . backlight not useful because it too dim . might well left off sold it couple bucks less	-1

bandflex comes two large boxes , each around 70 pounds . i surprised ups delivered them , since i got note amazon indicating eagle freight handling shipping . ( btw , this one those times when amazon prime pays itself , since shipping free under prime , but pretty costly without it . ) one box contains long arms beams , other contains base other smaller parts . there many bolts very similar ( but not identical ) lengths , sorting them out keeping track them during assembly time-consuming . two cresent wrenches required bolt gym together , phillips-head screwdriver . i would suggest using tape measure or ruler sort out bolts . assembly diagrams instructions owner manual adequate , but could clearer . overall , assembly took me 3 hours . only really tricky part attaching bungie cords -- pulleys they ride over -- gym . 3 cords ( each side ) need stretched little while you thread single bolt through all 3 pulleys keep cords slipping out or pulleys moving out alignment or bolt missing hole it mounts . one pulley set pre-assembled factory over-tightened needed loosened bit , which easy . when , gym very solid sturdy . i suspect it actually standard " stack " weight gym modified use bungie cords instead weight stack , which fine me , since it probably part reason it such low price compared competition . plus it keeps overall weight gym down around 140 pounds or so , which means i put it second floor my apartment without worrying overstressing loft floorboards . gym several attachments allows many exercises , including unexpected ones like rowing ( complete rolling seat ) . since cords increase resistance you stretch them , they give plenty " weight " end -- perhaps much more than 10/25/35 pounds suggested manual . other hand , they give less resistance start exercise . overall , i find exercises challenging , i'm still ways using all 3 cords once . plus , there isn't too much " transforming " needed ready gym next exercise type . reviewer suggested , cutting off safety clips bands makes changes resistance much easier ( but caused cords spontaneously unclip me couple times , so proceed caution ) . adding carabiners cord hooks cable rings * might * workable alternative cutting clips . however , changes resistance all exercises use " lower " pulley/cable set hard , you need duck under bench attach/detach pre-tensioned bands onto very small metal ring . pulldown bar uses this same cable , so it same issue . gym really fold up into surprisingly small footprint , rollers back aid positioning . but it definitely full-sized gym when unfolded , so it needs bit space . overall , i'm quite pleased gym . my biggest complaint , when starting exercises use bench incline ( like fly or bench presses ) , it very difficult reach waaaay down behind you grab cord handles , they're floor base gym . i've found hooking handle cords through training belt then draping belt over bench helps -- least reach isn't so bad , but it still isn't ideal . some sort velcro or hook back-top bench where handles could hang until needed would help lot . other than , i think gym sturdy , very usable , definite bargain price	-1
stamina definitely not bowflex , but then i can't afford bowflex . i really like sliding seat doing rowing type exercises . stamina wasn't too hard assemble , but there some quality issues parts i correct get everything fit together . my main complaint difficulty changing resistance bands . much this taken care cutting off plastic safety clips -- they really aren't needed . there also quality issues length ropes not even , which i correct knoting one . however , overall i'm pleased value	-1

after several pedometers through years became damaged after their clips either broke or slipped off my waist , i decided purchase via wrist pedometer . so far , via wrist performed very well . it 5 primary operational modes ( time , step , user data , alarm , chronograph ) . step mode 5 sub modes ( step/time , step/kcal , step/distance miles or kilometers , timer , steps target ) . user data mode allows user input his/her age , gender , weight lbs . or kg ., stride inches or centimeters . step/mileage counter appears accurate when i compared it one my expensive " waist " pedometers . via plastic wrist band which may or may not pose problem over long term . i plan purchasing via wrist pedometer gift relative who cross country jogger .	1

reviewer hinted , it probably wouldn't very hard make one yourself , it really just rope handle one hand flattened piece fits closed door stop it keep it slipping through . here what i like it : you know how fitness books always say : " don't let your feet get front your knees when you squat " . you can't much squat following rule , unless you something like this : you lean back while squatting , thereby keeping your shins vertical whole movement . perfect technique ! even better , you hold only one hand , effort your core keep position makes this more complete exercise , ( i don't know weight capacity this piece , so i won't advise this just yet , but one-handed grip straight-shin squat heavy dumbell other hand incredible exercise . ) not downplay other uses , but this alone worth price .	1

combination both magnetic resistance well fluid resistance makes trainer good job creating true road experience . there no adjustments other than adjusting trainer wheel diameter your bike . you change gears wheel spins faster , you experience resistance you would encounter road wind pushing you back . even after hour moderate speed , fluid magnetic units only moderately warm touch . heavy flywheel helps add smoothness ride . if you using slick road tire , amount noise generated relatively small . there some minor assembly required , but instructions well translated illustrated . even 5mm hex tool included . i recommend also getting riser , if one not included , allow proper leveling bike . unit comes skewer , which installed easily your bike case one already bike not fit lugs trainer clamp bike trainer . my case skewer already bike ( giant ) worked fine . i recommend this trainer step up those only magnetic resistance price point nearly hundred dollars below premium all fluid drive models market	-1

ok 1 instructions [ ... ] so unless you good understanding how airsoft guns work then i don't suggest unscrewing any screws2 i also experienced steady decline fps my friends so i determined find out cause . i thought it some kind loss pressure sure enough i right there o-ring attached bolt it slipped off where it supposed go . i popped it back into place after 1-2 hours fiddling i finally got dang thing back together , there lots small parts spring lots grease which doesn't help , it worked like new , so if you want take apart gun fix it every month or so then go ahead buy it but if you don't then don't buy it ( it only 35 bucks what you expect	-1
this gun came 3 days wen i ordered it , ive airsofting4 while alot my friends tokyo maruisand theirs shoot like 300fps up thier consistantly accurate .. this gun accurate if you use 20g bbs instead 12g . 12g cheaper , but when u shoot they go 22 feet curve what ever way they want ... one thing clip only holds 30-50 bbs ... if you try u fit 70 but i like fit only 30 or twenty so i rely skill rather than automatic ... i like play orchord(lots trees ) i knida wish guns orange tip wasnt so bright ... somtimes i think gun could use sling sliencer real scope ... scope came only good looks scaring people ... sights work way better.it hits really hard 300fps ... i recomend upgrade battery motor so u play longer shoot farther .... it shoot pretty far . when automatic it spools up shoots harder really fast . i recomend buying 330round clip it only 30 bucks more it saves your behind ....	-1

this eliptical not good heavy ones you find gym , but it almost good , cost it especially appealing . it took 2 hours assemble , but i'm not expert mechanical devices , so , reader , you probably cut it down 1 hour ( nevertheless after two hours i felt uncommon sense elation ) . users my eliptical 150 pounds 99 pounds respectively ( but i'm sure it take up 250 pounds -- both us together perhaps ) , it move little ( i exercise vigorously , so it moved 3 feet this morning ) during exercising , but under 300$ it worth it . definitely , worth it	1

i searched long hard bike trailer/stoller , but nowhere could i find mention this product front tire . so , i am writing it first , front tire rubber needs inflated prior use , just like back tires . overall , this great product price . it fit my budget safety concerns . manufacturer details many reviews say you not need tools assemble so it very easy put together . i found while it simple put together , attaching it my bike bit challenge . you need bend tow bar fit coupler your bike , which difficult first few times . bug/rain cover tight first few times well , or it could way i attching it velcro i streching it one side other . however , i think it good material stiff begining it tends strech time use . my son loves kick his feet up against screen where velcro attaches top front together , it seems holding up pretty good . trailer itself wide i could not fit it through my door . this largely due covers around wheels . i older house so back then they didn't seem concerned door width . most stores automatic doors which more than wide enough . i go movie rental chain trailer just barely fit . i only one child so bringing handle bar stoller easy , but seems awkward if two children riding it . i seen reviews mention both children plenty even cargo . product comes safety strap handle bar when using stroller ( not pictured many shots i've seen ) brake straps you hook around tires ( also not pictured ) . belts inside not your typical 5 point harness shoulder straps , lap belt crotch straps not connect single point . lap belt must put child first tightened , then shoulder straps adjusted height child tightened , then connected crotch strap . shoulder straps slightly paded , but i haven't seen any other bike trailer this price range better padding or any whatsoever . i also found out bike trailers just like cars , every year they new models so previous year model goes sale . if you going avid biker who alternate biking jogging daily dirt trails or beaches or taking your child(ren ) weekend excursions through mountians or rough terrain then this probably isn't bike trailer you . but keep mind , next version up priced way too ( next cheapest i found over $350 just trailer , bike attachment almost $200 stroller kit just much ) .	-1

i bought this particular rower based solely great reviews it received here amazon , i not disappointed . this fantastic rower . it really truly mimic natural rowing motion it very quiet when use . you listen music or watch t.v. not either one driving everyone else out house while you workout . i find rower extremely relaxing workout . i am 40+ female i assembled rower myself under two hours . included putting rowing handles wrong side first go around . what everyone else suggested lay all pieces out . hardware very efficiently packaged segmented package so you only need open parts you need you go through each step . it really couldn't any easier assemble . i bought mine through amazon only gripe i amazon required signature delivery i not home first time so ticked me off because i wasn't aware need signature . just forewarned if you aren't usually home when your ups deliveries arrive . if you're into rowing fun exercise , you love this kettler rower	1
when i travel i always travel week time , stay condo , where there clothes washer . so taking lot clothes not nessessary . this backpack large enough 3 skirts , 1 pair capris , 6 summer tops , 1 zip-up hoodie , 1 beach towel , bathing suit , underwear , 2 pairs sandals , bag personal care products . small detachable backpack perfect liquid bath products extremly convenient when checking through security airports . two zipped together before bording it one bag , therefore you additional carry-on . when you get your seat just un-zip little pack they both fit over-head bins , you keep third bag your feet ! airlines lost my checked luggage two different trips , taking joy out traveling . so when i found this piece i knew i would not check luggage again unless i wanted ! i not use big bag backpack but i looked straps they made quality materials , i know i won't hessitate use it cappacity . my daughter planning trip through europe next year already asked borrow mine . shhh ,,, don't tell her , but she getting one her college graduation !!	1

wow , i admit this indeed very great sword . most people selling this sword 89-99 dollars . this sword only $45 it same sword other ones . me , shipping 20 dollars , so makes it $65 total . some people think since this sword half cost other ones same kind , it might kind shabby poorly made . this not true . my sword perfectly made it pristine condition when i got it . only problem there small scratch sheath , but it so small it not even noticable unless you get your face really close it . i highly recommend this sword any sword collector , not just bleach fans . if you bleach fan , you get this ... seriously , you get it . not waste your money ones cost twice much	1
it relatively easy assemble , although i smash my finger pretty good while attaching elastic cord . resistance not great , even if you pull really hard , so it take longer " feel burn " this rower compared others . but , it only $200 , you get good workout if you put little extra time	-1

come , what good 5-inch stick street ? answer " plenty . " many people who would turn their noses up pocket stick wouldn't hesitate defend themselves their knuckles . you might see people like this walking around bandages , splints , or casts , because hands soft , small bones , heads big , thick bones full teeth . but even cement heads street criminals don't fare well against hard metal . good hammer fist one these cause even tough guy see fireworks canary birds . i wrote review pocket stick : let not kid around . this may touted nonlethal weapon , it may ( or may not ) look better you if it turns up search or court than , say , knife or gun , but purpose this or any effective weapon harm attacker until he cannot attack anymore . it injure , maim , or kill just surely bullet -- just not so easily . so before you bonk someone coconut this little item , make sure you consider moral , spiritual , legal consequences . this brings up vital point . salesmen , martial arts instructors , your lawyer may well-advised call this " defensive weapon . " fine , but out there world , there no such thing . calling this " hesitation " stick showing judo masters using it submission tool fancy joint locks just distracts what you doing it if , god forbid , need arises . bashing criminal assailant until he unable ( or unwilling ) continue his assault , preferably before he ever gets one shot you . assisting you this purpose pocket stick handy size shape . you stick it back pocket like pen it out attack it quicker than any weapon i know , chances relatively good your attacker never see it literally not know what hitting him . this especially advantageous if two nasties closing but haven't struck yet . you hit first then see if second punk wants step over his buddy face one-on-one odds . while he thinking it over , you run . you see , this not what usually called defensive mindset . i'd take keyring off because it way . i really don't see point hanging keys weapon . it supposed make us think it not really weapon so we feel better ourselves ? no , thanks . anyway , mine my back pocket next my wallet	1

this thing great doing squats . shape conforms neck/shoulder/trap area nicely actually distributes weight across your back more evenly ; much moreso than those round pads or bar alone . very comfortable your back so you focus pushing weight . thing i really like it once you center pad bar ( it pops right off ) you know sure your body centered under weight , so you're not teetering . plastic flexible soft enough so it comfortable it super easy clean .	1
