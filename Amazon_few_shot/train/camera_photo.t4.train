bought these my nikon d200 3 months ago . never used tiffen before i took chance recommendation . vignetting issue polarizing filters vignetting this one worse i've seen . build quality all filters really not very good . going go back hoya which much better	-1
i am not impressed tiffen filters i got this set . finish rings poor . despite previously poor reputaion , i recently purchased some 67mm quantaray filter local ritz camera store which much better quality compared this set tiffen filters . i never got tiffens before , good experience hoyas . i probably stay those now . now come think it , ritz camera indicated quantaray they made hoya . glass all filters quite bit more reflective compared hoyas quantarays . not good sign . circular polarizer some smudges some lense swirl after 10 sheets lense tissue quite bit cleaning solution failed fully cleared off . quite frustrating . all filters came lint few little smudges them , not sure if store handling or manufacturer handling blame , but none other filters i got before this kind problem right out box . set might cheap , but it sure good reason	-1
i paid extra air next day service . item advertised available ready ship immediately . item eventually arrived two weeks later . i left trip . item eventually sent back merchant . merchant didn't credit me item returned . i email merchant wait 2 weeks before item credited . i won't buy willoughby again	-1
i am my third off-camera cord ( one per year ) . two broken . other reviewers noted , four screws under metal retaining clip " female " end cord loosen eventually fail . i found thin narrow knife used remove black " spring " cover over screws shoe . you then tighten screws screwdriver . if you use locktite screws then they not loosen . canon should this factory . i use this cord stroboframe " portrait/landscape " grip which raises flash over camera six inches thus eliminating red eye providing much more pleasing light . stroboframe grip comes right size threaded screw this cord . when my cords failed i lost extended-through lens metering just like reviewer noted . i am not professional photographer only use camera occasionally yet cord still fails . canon should re-engineer this cord make it more durable . unfortunately , i not believe there alternative cords . it looks like i need keep buying canon cords	-1
this kit just junk . quot ; deluxe blower brushquot ; cheap plastic blower tiniest size . there quot ; tweezersquot ; just folded aluminum sheet metal - there no way getting anywhere near my cameras . there few sheets lense tissue few swabs use cleaning solution . quot ; lintless cleaning clothquot ; 3quot ; 5quot ; piece something akin reusable paper towels you'll use three times then throw away . this kit not worth buying any price , because it not worth shipping charges	-1
nearly $100 , this adaptor provides very little ( 1.5 ) magnification . it also nuisance because you switch camera settings every time you use lens it function properly . this no big deal wide angle adaptor , which used infrequently me , but it when you want capture fleeting image distance . it lightweight , but cumbersome doesn't accept filters . real telephoto capabilities , get slr interchangeable lenses . i sent this product back .	-1
300mm this lens very soft , it hard get shot looks like it focus . so , you need shoot f/11 , then since there little light available , you usually bump iso 800 or 1600 just get acceptable shutter speed . course , high iso then introduces other artifacts . focus also dead slow often doesn't lock . this lens i constantly fought . don't upgrade new 70-300 either , it only marginally better . buy 70-200 f/4l . it far superior lens	-1
looks nice . unfortunately not power up camera , so i can't say much else . going cost me return shipping very least . sorry i didn't buy canon product instead	-1
i only wish i could return this camera . its automatic focus not work well photographing landscape scenes plants ( what i most ) its manual focus difficult ( very difficult ) use . my much cheaper , lower resolution , old minolta much better job low light conditions . i find i delete half my photographs due bad focus . addition , photo files take 5 6 seconds save my so-called high-speed memory card . don't buy this camera	-1
i bought this lens based super telephoto ability low cost . you truly get what you pay , this thing isn't worth plug nickel . i took few shots tripod could not believe how terrible this lens @ 300mm ( 480mm digital rebel xt ) . incredibly soft . even stopped down , i would never want make enlargement it . stay away . don't believe fools who novices , you disappointed this lens . you're much better off buy older used 100-300mm 5.6 ( version costs more too ) but both so much better than this junker . you're even more crazy if you think you take decent photo this lens handheld . switched nikon when switching digital , i almost judged canon this one lens , which i'm glad i didn't . don't waste your money or learn hard way like i . this lens also terrible purple fringing , almost bad kit 18-55mm . after extensive research testing i now own am happy following canon lenses : canon 10-22mmcanon 28-105mm ( 3.5 version)canon 100-300mm ( 5.6 non-l version ) i sell version when i afford it . kit 18-55mm makes usable shots , but when i could afford it , i sold it too . you get better results buying rebel xt older 100-300mm than you would brand new xti this terrible 75-300mm lens .	-1
i deeply dissapointed this lens hood . given cost 10% cost lens which it intended ( 70-300 this case ) i expected it stiff durable polycarbonate . -positives-fulfills basic function lens hood- prevents flare , etc . bayonet locking system excellent , much easier deal than scew-on type lens hoods . that it . -negatives-the polycarbonate so thin i half expect it translucen t.t he hood must gripped base remove it , grippng thin end hood may break it ; or least it feels like it may break it . its very long . especially 70-300 which already long lens , this makes fully extended zoom foot long . that pretty conspicuous . it very overpriced vs . generic lenses ($50 vs . $5-10 rubber or metal ) . i traded it went kalt rubber lens hood . 2 stars great bayonet design , but rest it weak	-1

like most people i got this camera because it quite compact quality image . i've pleased image quality when it works , but start it felt flimsy felt like it would die any rough treatment . sure enough : * shutter cover often stuck open or shut . * sometimes it refuses start all . * it sometimes powers you're putting it into your pocket , which opens barrel which got damage camera . * finally , lcd stopped working altogether . this after 8 months . casio decided i'm not under warranty ( no explanation why , no phone number argue them ) , charging me $97 repair it . don't seduced ! it poor quality product	-1
i received this filter it used , seals open case holds filters cracked , piece plastic floating loose inside , smug marks it . i shocked , i order amazon all time never anything show up like this .	-1

after just over year , my lens jammed display read " e18 " . so i pretty upset discover this extremely common defect - defect canon refuses admit . try googling canon s500 e18 " , you'll see what i meant . don't buy it unless you want very expensive paperweight	-1
average people who want camera just works-and takes good pics you should not buy this . i don't know specifics , but like other reviewers mine got stuck quit working no reason after couple months . so , i don't really see what all bells whistles if it doesn't even take picture . it fine while it worked , it ate batteries but pics good	-1

hello all , lens hoods pretty much necessity , but this mostly poorly made hood i've ever used . unlike other hoods screw , this one requires you press opposing clips then slide hood one , release clips . this leads problems alignment , meaning both sides clip need perfectly aligned order hood fit right . although it pain i hate ... i don't really alternative . either go w/o hood , or take this one . either way , guess i'd rather hood lense than not one	-1
close friend made unfortunate mistake plunking down 2 grand this camera . honestly olympus produces cameras same thing $400 . i've used hers image quality horrible colours wrong 9 times out 10 . if you're going spend much camera , get d70 instead buy nice extra lens or some other gadgets go . pictures better it offers more mp	-1
polarizing filters used eliminate glare non-metallic surfaces like glass or water . they also used increase contrast color saturation your image . i use my polarizer not only eliminate glare , but also make skies nice shade blue or get some " pop " out clouds . there so many options consider when purchasing polarizing filter your needs . instance , linear vs . circular , film or digital versions , or quality vs . price . if you making use ttl or auto-focusing system , circular polarizers designed work those features . linear polarizers their uses , but they manufactured differently may not work . unless you certain , just get circular polarizing filter . there some digital circular polarizers market . i am not sure what makes cir-pl lens better digital opposed film . i use canon 20d digital slr see no problems caused using supposed non-digital filter digital camera . most time , when it comes filters ; you get what you pay . mean you need expensive polarizer ? course not , just sure get right filter your needs . what ever polarizing filter you get , make sure it color neutral prevent unwanted tinting . spending more color balanced filter save time post . if you need multiple filter sizes , consider saving money using step down rings . currently i use hoya pro1 filters , canon polarizing filters i previously owned without question bulkier heavier . weight might not seem like much , but when you stick all your items backpack all extra bits weight add up quickly . i spend good amount time my equipment my back so this big concern me . when it came down images , times i would see browning tint my photos . tint easy clean up photoshop cs2 , but i don't see problem hoya pro1 filter . overall , i would recommend against canon polarizing filters . i originally thought , " it canon , it must quality . " since then i replaced all my canon filters . this filter works , but comes cost disadvantages other similarly priced filters . pros : used film or digital cameras eliminates internal reflections ghosting cons : bulky heavynot neutral color balance	-1
documentation terrible . its going take lot practice . if you're just going stick it top your camera its fine . however i want use it off-camera trigger 2 sb600s . just setting d200 fire pre-flash trigger sb800/masster sb600s it nightmare its not covered any detail , manual . sb800 designed this purpose . so why not include information how this ?	-1
i bought this lens my canon 30d after reading every professional review i could find . i knew going this lens wasn't perfect but , supposed better than 18-55 kit lens . i liked range it provided image stabilization . i shot pictures this lens extremely dissapointed . pictures not sharp all colors dull . i thought it might my new camera first because i couldn't imagine quality would this bad . i ruled this out after i used my canon 28-105 lens i my canon film slr results much better . digital focal length though , my old lens wouldn't suffice because 1.6 focal factor . later , i decided tamron 17-50/ 2.8 after reading reviews . salesperson professional camera store guessed my pictures very soft when i told him i this canon lens . he said , " let me guess , you'd like try tamron 17-50/ 2.8 . " he said this very best lens buy price range take it home try it . i could return it no questions asked if i wasn't satisfied . he also said he hadn't one person return it yet . my first images this lens great . they sharp way more vibrant color . there absolutely no comparison all . i hesitant buy third party lens but , my fears instantly eliminated after seeing results . this first review i ever posted amazon . i so dissapointed i wanted help others not make same mistake . after spending $$$ digital slr , it would waste not get great pictures it because lens . before taking chance buying canon , yourself big favor try canon tamron local store .	-1
i bought this monopod 3 weeks ago after reading reviews here . i'm not sure if i got defective unit but i've these problems gitgo : -i noticed 2 lower sections not open close smoothly , they would get stuck 2-3 inches lock you'd need force expand/retract them . very interestingly , if section right above one i'm trying expand/retract unlocked then operation smooth flawless ! -the ballhead not support my nikon d80 lightest lens ( 18-55mm ) less than 2 lbs combo , which much lighter than 4.4 lbs weight limit indicated specs . camera just slumps one direction or regardless how hard i try make sure ballhead locked tightly . again , it might defective unit , but i thought i'd point my observations out anyway . i wanted buy this amazon , it wasn't stock , it sitting my shopping cart when it became available amazon bumped price $40+ , so i went elsewhere got it $30 .	-1

i watch videos my kids my 50 " plasma , 32 " lcd mac , trying convince myself i like quality , my wife walks says , " fuzzy .

look feel this camcorder very good . unfortunately my camcorder use limited low light indoor activities . example , evening party , indoor school activities , kid drama orchestra . this camcorder not all suitable these activities . earlier i sony dcr trv140 , which way better than this camcorder . this camcorder very small sensor hence such low price . one easy guide evaluate sensor size look optical zoom . most camcorders more than 10x optical zoom small sensors . these large optical zoom camcorders perform poorly low light . if you planning use this camcorder low indoor light , i not recommend it .	-1
i owned s410 camera almost two years , when new years eve i pulled out my handy camera , padded case it always , my horror , e18 error message appeared ! it hasn't worked since . i paid $400 this camera canon would like $110 ( plus taxes ) fix problem - ridiculous . especially since this seems very common problem their cameras . i've enjoyed camera picture quality ease use , but what waste spend much money take pictures it just under two years ! beware this flaw canon doesn't seem acknowledge	-1
this first digital camera i purchased . i am adventurous person wanted something would stand up my lifestyle . this camera wasn't it . good*it compact , which pretty convenient*it several camera functions potential work well if you techno-savvy . bad*after snorkeling it 30 minutes , camera leaked broke . olympus replaced it , but only after my 2 month stay costa rica over . * functions unreliable difficult use . rarely if ever i get them work how i want . pictures always need touched up afterwards , sometimes seriously . * zoom sucks . don't expect get those awesome close ups they advertise unless you some serious patience . * image stabilization joke . you need tripod or surgeons hands take pictures aren't blurry . * user manual left me lot questions	-1

i bought this camera after owning olympus digital camera years . i extremely happy my olympus , but wanted something smaller would fit my purse or diaper bag since i'm expecting . this camera such disappointment . just every single picture i took huge white blobs all over it . ( this only happened when using flash . i must admit camera takes great pictures broad daylight without flash . ) plus , if you used zoom all , pictures came out fuzzy . first digital camera i ever owned ( 7 years ago ) took better pictures ! store i bought camera wouldn't take it back because i waited two days past 14-day return policy . so , i sold camera took $100 loss . i'd much rather lose $[ ... ] than keep this camera	-1
this tough because this camera takes beautiful pictures . it takes wonderful video . downloading easy general it " fine " camera . however .... flash it nothing short nightmare . it constantly over exposing every subject . i find it practically un-usable . only way i get image i'm looking lower light setting set iso 800 . if it 1600 iso i wouldn't need flash all practically but it doesn't offer . other thing i don't like i didn't realize i wouldn't like it doesn't it own cradle which charge batteries . batteries removed charged seperately . doesn't sound like big deal but it pain when you think it . batteries lose their charge even when camera isn't which results picking up camera after 2 days realizing it no juice . intensely dissatisfying . this camera also really long delay pushing button taking picture . this results lots closed eyes stupid faces . i know most digitals delay but this one epic . i am getting ready sell this camera buy canon . i am wedding photographer shoot mostly my canon 5d . but since this rated camera year american photo ( publication i trust implicitly ) , i decided stray my canon . bad idea . i'm going right powershot . not pass go . not collect $200 . i reccommend you same .	-1

this scope not good starter scope anyone interested astronomy . here why : 1 . objective too small , only 60 mm , 2.36 inches , so it too small bring light necessary even beginning look universe . i suppose it adequate moon , but it . planets appear very small disks . one able see saturn rings , but image very small . forget it deep sky objects , clusters , galaxies , etc . 2 . mount altazimuth , which not follow celestial object sky . earth rotating , anyone focusing star or moon quickly find object drifting out field vision . better mount equatorial mount which makes it much easier track objects . 3 . 4mm eyepiece too powerful this scope . observer find it hard look through ( very small eye opening ) , most cases cause blurred images . 20 mm eyepiece only functional eyepiece . barlow 3x , which again too poweerful this scope . 4 . mount vibrate when touched , which cause image eyepiece " shiver " , which very frustrating . even low price , don't enticed this scope ; it too many flaws . save your money larger scope better mount . jim " konedog " koenig , astronomy buf	-1

i bought this item gift , it ended up becoming mine . i say , i am greatly dissatisfied . here some main issues i am camera : 1 . it very poorly designed . look feel camera not elegant . buttons really ugly , operating camera awkward , some functions requires both hands operate .. 2 . camera issues turning off occasionally . 3 . worst , far , picture quality . colors just plain terrible . automatic settings disaster photography . i used canon ( 2mp ) before getting this one ( 5mp ) . canon far superior quality , colors , lighting .. i don't need large files trash , i am perfectly fine smaller files great pictures . result , i am strongly recommending getting different camera . i great experiences canon ; seems like sony nikon doind good job too . but hp must stop making cameras , indeed many other devices .	-1
i loved camera , absolutely loved it . i using it one night it died . i went home put charger nothing happened . light charger didn't flash or camera didn't even go after dying . second time i used it , i just got back vacation put it charger . i able turn it look pictures . i looking pictures , it just shut off . i unable find way turn it back or even shut nose . i would not recommend it this reason unless charger you get different than mine .	-1

i bought this camera like 7 months ago since it so small i liked design .... but pictures it takes suck , specially night time or flash , you barely see what you photographing . video feature its ok even though you cant change zoom while making video , but design doesnt suit well this feature since audio-in exact same place where you suppossed hold camera ... so most my videos dont audio since i blocking audio entrace ... its small portable , i could fit it any pocket , so thats good , but its so small battery lasts only aorund 90 min ... that what it says , but it keep going down like 5times faster than regular min , so it only last like 30 min	-1

add e18 error code complaint list ! i purchased camera year ago , e18 error last 2 months . camera intermitently freeze up not work all , just beep you give you error code e18 . i've tried all recommended fixes compressed air alignment twist . nothing seems keep it functioning more than few shots . canon wants nothing fix , estimates repairs $150 $200 . save headaches , buy camera different manufacturer !	-1
i've this camera just over year ( figures ) it gone completely bonkers me . sometimes it works other times it puts black lines across screen making it useless . you never know when you turn it whether it work or not -- making it completely unreliable . keep mind this camera used almost entirely inside my business , so it wasn't abused , dropped , thrown bottom purse , etc . it treated very carefully probably only shot 2,000 pictures total . frankly , i'm kind glad it broke so i excuse replace it . here why : 1 . takes beautiful still shots , but forget any kind action . it takes too long shots get good action . it also blurs nearly all action shots i've ever taken , regardless what mode it . 2 . red-eye aweful . it should better . i doubt i'll ever buy canon	-1

i start off saying , i loved my sony cybershot . when alpha came out i couldn't wait get one . it died after 200 pictures day three three week once life time trip through south america . amazon said it out their hands because it must returned within 30 days . i've spent 3 hours so far dealing sony . most people i spoke or on-line live chat support unfamiliar product transferred me around business support , computers , video . they also contradicted one . when i get someone who knew product i told firmly despite camera lemon malfunctioning after only taking 200 pictures they would only ' repair it ' not replace it . now i am stuck lemon , i fear i history further disappointment frustration this camera . i highly recommend you read all customer reviews . other people problems camera , i ignored them because i faith sony thought other alpha owners ' dud cameras unusual . if you decide purchase anyway , i highly recommend you not buy through amazon , but through real store good fair return policy , stands behine their products . places like microcenter exhange , no questions ask . i am kicking myself because amazon $100 cheaper then microcenter . penny wise pound foolish . i love amazon , but , i never buy anything other than books dvds them . lesson learned electronics .	-1
i own several great digital cameras . it seems like i get one each use - one good zoom , camera its good flash use lowlight others . this one i wanted high mp small compact size i put into my pocket . first few photos great , taken outdoors my sunny patio . then every picture i took after ( same settings - fine , hq , poster 10m etc ... vertical lines started showing lcd screen pictures all washed out . when i download them computer , they look exactly way too - lines almost all white . i've played around settings ( i know how work them ) but still it same . so time return find better one . that too bad since i read some good reviews wanted it	-1

i one word argus quick clix , horrible . i bought two these cameras give my daughters christmas . camera lists numerous features what enticed me buy them . i looking inexpensive camera general use . this camera takes horrible pictures . all photos blue tinge them fuzzy . when flash used it so strong there nothing but white out subject . one very irritating feature camera comes flash off . there no way change setting let it come flash . you go through series menus turn it then it takes almost 20 seconds flash get ready use . stated when it finally come you take picture , it so bright picture useless . i would not recommend this camera anyone	-1
sd card worked fine week . problems arise then worsens over time one more week then it just doesn't work anymore . problem not pda , nor software it . tried use card separate flash reader/writer . tried formatting it fat32 , create test directory , data stays less than one hour . i would refrain buying this product .	-1
idea wonderful but window too small useful . i it , pictures it , but never show it anyone . trying find right light illuminate tiny picture ridiculous . easier show few pictures my wallet	-1
downside : 1 . i'll add my complaint several others who same problem . camera suddenly stopped working after nearly 18 months no problems . i switched batteries ... let it set some time without batteries or memory card it ... nothing getting it work . top i now memory card photos it i can't transfer my computer without working camera . 2 . not good indoors pictures especially if you try " night " mode . if you use mode , even tripod , keep your subjects still-lifes , only ... if you photograph people they happen move even slightest , they best blurry , worst they look like double exposures . 3 . indoors pictures set normal mode , or without flash , no better may even worse than your standard cheap 35mm camera . upside : 1 . through its usb cable , it booted right into apple iphoto software making organizing editing photos i took breeze . 2 . outdoors , plenty sunlight , gave me near-perfect pictures got lot praise . kodak well this aspect camera ability , given price . 3 . we won this camera ( free ) so me it almost all upside ... except now i shell out $$$ good camera ( hopefully read my current memory card	-1

worst thing this , you bring bench disc you replace disc every 20 min if you capturing hd video . i think most buyers would take hd video if you buy hd camcorder . but small disc only hold 20 min hd video , change disc time time . cmos sensor worse than ccd but it best sensor among cmos this price today . lot noise come low light condition ! i bought it $800 return it . i think you'd better buy sr1 30g hard drive . would much better one !	-1

this product only display 142 photos no matter how many you may able squeeze onto media card . this little fact isn't mentioned all packaging or manual ( hidden consumer ) . i initially loaded 1,400 photos onto 128mb card shocked only see 142 displayed . firmware upgrade offered manufacturer their website increase this number 250 , but i could never get file load into frame . annoying aspect slideshow plays photos same order everytime you start it same music . it would nice hear random music track start each time frame turned see some later photos instead watch same photos play same order each time you turn frame back . definitely not worth price . shell out couple more bucks something supports unlimited photos allows random playback	-1

i very disappointed nikon service . this camera 2in lcd display apparently very fragile . when i returned service , nikon claimed i dropped it ... which i didn't! i very careful handling this camera , but fragile lcd still broke . blamed manufacturer really disappointing . they offered repair it $210 , nearly price new camera . i never nikon product again . if they going sell such fragile product , they should least include hard case it .	-1
manufacturer apparently states this case compatible panasonic fz1 ( extension fz3 which identical body ) . i bought it report it not compatible fz1 . just lens cap you jam it into bag sideways then wrestle camera get it back out . if you prefer use camera lens hood adapter camera can't fit bag all . there also no padding speak this case . comparison my lowe case my canon eos elan provides secure , padded repository you put camera lens down strap top so camera easily withdrawn again . targus makes decent laptop cases , but they great deal learn camera cases apparently . apparently it fit some cameras , just not panasonic fzs . considering product made china one should able expect bit more this price	-1
i spent couple hours , trying get transfer dv my camcorder my mac powerbook . after hours hours i realize usb cable delivered sony camcorder absolutely worthless . if you don't own sony vaio ( which my opinion just overdesigned peace fancy 007 gear i . link connection , which no other pc/mac has)your getting frustrated pretty quick . i would given cable 5 star rating , but way i get cable , buy it seperately , big rip off . however i found exact same cable apple store called " thin fire wire " . exact same cable ( 1.8 meter 4 6 pin exact ) only $29 it works just fine . so check out apple store near you save some money . shame you sony	-1
i bought my kodak v570 less than year ago . first only annoyance i fact i use attachment transfer pictures video mov format made it diffcult edit . but few months ago , focus refused work properly . wide angle , it fine but when i zoomed , image unacceptably blur . i tried every setting , finally gave up called kodak service . i asked mail camera sydney melbourne where i live . few weeks later , camera returns note there noting wrong it . since i still could not take acceptable pictures , i contacted them again . this time told send pictures via e-mail . i my surprise answer poor lighting caused shutter speed slow down hence blur images . but pictures taken broad daylight . when i disagreed logic comment , i told call them discussion over phone . but number they gave me fax number . using my resources , i got touch technical service phone . this time i told try using tripod if pictures come out alright , it probably due shaky hands ! it though they people tech support who never owned camera who never taken pictures before their lives . it so frustrating thinking damage camera my recent india trip when many pictures turned out blur . now i put up illogical incompetent service people . there no way i ever buy kodak again . i recommend it only my worst enemies . i now , again , send camera troubleshooting going level service so far , i am not holding my breath answers . still want buy kodak ? go ahead but don't say i not warn you . way , my other camera casio it works beautifully shaky hands or not	-1

i purchased this digital picture frame after doing my homework , reading all reviews i could different kinds . one i purchased flawed , would take 5 or 6 tries inserting memory card before i could get it boot up . when it running i very disappointed quality pictures . what description this product not tell you - frame not come usb cable- so it not hook up computer . this means you must either all pics you want display already memory card your camera , or you must have/purchase card reader download pics your computer your camera card . ( side note - if you sony digital camera , memory sticks not allow you back any pics onto them your computer not taken their format - so forget using pics someone else sent , you took camera , or you reformatted photo program ) . i went digital pic frame brookstone instead - far better quality , much more user friendly	-1

theory , this camera perfect . fits into your pocket . video quality definately good considering it records compressed format mpeg-4 . pictures good if you know how finesse it . perfect all around anytime camrea , right ? here thing . i got camera mainly video . i just daughter wanted something those candid moments i could always me . also , i not want minidv because uploading computer real time . i wanted sd card film , even if it would sacrfice some video quality . but thing ruins this camera me mic picks up lens motor/ auotfocus nosie . playback i cearly hear zooming zooming out every time lens focuses . it sounds like someone smoking hooka . get this , it even says so instruction manual , page 35 , " caution during video clip playback , sound motor audible .... during recording , sound optical zoom movement or autofocus movement recorded . this not malfunction . " awful . way , take picture while recording video function worthless . it leaves pause your video image while sound keeps recording , still image captured usually blury . whats point anyway , i think camera built function extract still video . or you it whatever editing software you use . oh , one last thing . i keep still camera sports mode get clean pic . my hand shakes too much . there digital stabalization video , but no optical stabilization stills . its big shame , too . camera very cool . if not audible motor noise , i would given this least 8/10 . but lens motor noise unacceptable ! ps . all cameras today should built lens cover . this one cheap plastic one , you'll probably lose	-1

i recommend not purchase this item . look one . lens itself seems ok , although i can't really say , but adapter which built lens shoddy cumbersome ruins whole deal . adapter quick release type where one end attaches camera lens simply snaps , or quickly released . this would great , except two very important things . one , lens fits very loosely quick release adapter . this causes some major distortion , especially when moving . two , housing made thin plastic which not seem very durable . fact it so cheaply thin i am afraid leave it my car because heat may distort plastic . one drop , even small one , it	-1

this awesome little camera . except you can't use it night ! there horrible white spots nighttime photos when flash used . apparently these appear because flash so close lens this camera , so dust reflects badly . it known problem [ ... ] also , it totally annoying sony uses all their proprietary technology . result , cable connecting this camera computer unwieldly ( uhh , you heard usb ??!! ) , you buy sony memory stick , which probably won't work anything else you . flipside , you take movies aren't limited 30 seconds this guy - i think might result memory stick technology . but other than , design operation this little guy seems pretty slick . lens not one those pops out , so not sure if affects image quality all , but far i could tell , quality good . end , what good camera can't take usable pictures its flash ??	-1

some digital cameras no viewfinder all , but nikon 8400 " electronic viewfinder " reviews good price great , so i bought camera . electronic viewfinder turns out too dark see face person you trying photograph indoors flash , you cannot see any expressions , just outline person head , so you guess shoot several times then see photos you just shot viewfinder . outdoors you cannot see enough detail viewfinder know what you including your shot . " display " lcd monitor small washes out sunligh t.t he background flash shots unacceptably dark . after 3 days use 90 shots i mailed it back " ritz amazon " this morning , dec 5 . they require it back " within 10 days receipt purchase " , their " date order " nov 29 it arrived my house dec 3 . it good thing i already compact flash card use , there not one box if i waited one i ordered arrive , well , it not here yet . it cost me $11.65 return it , insured , 2 day delivery " delivery confirmation receipt " . camera some strengths well it weaknesses , but only short time try it out before " 10 days " ran out serious difficulty trying see what i shooting i gave up it	-1
i ordered two items above error . i not think first order submitted properly so therefore second one ordered came antonline . i trying since dec . 19 return wide angle lens adapter them . i am 71 years old not computer savvy . i just wish i could get return labels my account credited . they still original packing received never opened . thank you interested . i informed them my time expired . i not believe this true , or your opening web page not apply them .	-1
if you want quality product , this ain't it . dreaded " remove cassette " error true full force . don't take my word it , search net find hundreds , upon thousands unhappy consumers who purchased this piece junk discovered it hard way . i highly suggest panasonic ag-dvx100 . it costs bit more , but well worth it . before reading other reviews , make sure they comparing gl-2 cam , like tony . shores . he compares canon gl-piece-of-junk-2 sony hdr-fx1 . sure , sony much better , but it also high-definition cam . if you want hd , check out panasonic ag-hvx200 . your research , read reviews	-1
i bought this item gift , it ended up becoming mine . i say , i am greatly dissatisfied . here some main issues i am camera : 1 . it very poorly designed . look feel camera not elegant . buttons really ugly , operating camera awkward , some functions requires both hands operate .. 2 . camera issues turning off occasionally . 3 . worst , far , picture quality . colors just plain terrible . automatic settings disaster photography . i used canon ( 2mp ) before getting this one ( 5mp ) . canon far superior quality , colors , lighting .. i don't need large files trash , i am perfectly fine smaller files great pictures . result , i am strongly recommending getting different camera . i great experiences canon ; seems like sony nikon doind good job too . but hp must stop making cameras , indeed many other devices .	-1

i attracted cannon zr800 due very small size very low cost . however , you get what you pay , although you get much more other brands just little increase cost . i've already returned my cannon zr800 replaced it sony dcr-hc38 . smallest problem canon continued motor noise , which you should aware it if you read any review any zr800 predecessors . problem motor very loud , you hear very annoying whirr if you indoors . this could forgivable given low cost , but problem zoom noise not . when you zoom out , very noticable clicking noise occurs when you let go zoom switch . it loud click when you play back your video this click amplified your video . it impossible watch video not notice this click . it annoying , unusual big flaw these new zr cannon camcorders . i called technical support , person took zr800 tried it out then acknowledged problem exist ( she seemed stunned this noise occuring ) . bottom line , this camcorder absolutely unusable due this clicking noise would not worth using even if it free . not but it . btw , i love sony dch-hc38 which bit more expensive , like zr800 , just recently came onto market .	-1
i can't say sure my experience typical , but i say it horrible . short version : i return it once screen failure , then i return replacement screen failure ( refund ) . returns , i spent significant amount time phone customer support . manual inadequate , especially wireless stuff . i also problems windows ( network bridging , i think ) further complicated things . brief time two units worked , i pleased . picture quality good , once running , i no problems software . i take lot digital photos . this would perfect compliment . i gave memory frame two stars ( instead one ) because , failures configuration problems , i pleased quality display . too bad i couldn't say same quality control .	-1

i bought this camera my 4yr old granddaughter who handle my digital camera quite well found it total waste . camera much smaller than expected , trying figure out what mode you're ridiculous display quite difficult see let alone interpret . nothing simple " one step " procedure which you would expect item geared towards children . i so frustrated setting it up i didn't bother giving it her . software installed okay but also far " kid friendly " . i wish i would've found read these user opinions before making purchase . ironically , reviews i see made it out better than other cameras market kids . i believe you'd better off purchasing " regular " inexpensive digital camera your potential " shutterbugs " .	-1
this camera waste money should taken off market . after purchase we never able retreive pictures . computer would recognize camera but stated no pictures available download . it not only difficult use but not even adult could figure out how take picture this product made child . instructions complicated eventually you give up . even putting batteries complicated you need screwdriver ( smallest one you find ) achieve it . unfortunately , i wasted my money but luckily you don't	-1
overall , i entirely disappointed this camaera . packaging description deceiving . there no view finding screen , only teeny , tiny window regular camera . this gift child who would just much fun throw away camera . i bought it because i wanted give her digital large view finding screen . construction would not hold up single drop ground . i would not recommend this anyone	-1

panasonic very compact , very stylish sexy my wife called it , but photos very disappointing : they way noisy ! even if set lowest asa setting 80asa it just barely acceptable they get progressively worse anything above 100asa . colours good , it take very good videos , but still photos just plain bad when compared other cameras photoshop cs2 . course it easy understand why : native resolution images . if one investigates such things , notice panasonic only 72 dpi , same sony , canon improves this 180 , nikon 300 dpi . it not just megapixels folks , but how those megapixels recorded what resolution . obviously camera 72 dpi more noise than one 180 or 300 dpi . so before you buy any digital camera or thinking upgrading newer model , yourself favour . try 4 or 5 cameras same megapixel range good camera store taking photos same subject same light condition . set camera lowest asa highest picture quality jpg format , take photos , pop sd card into computer , compare images photoshop . enlarge full pixel size ( 100%) , look meta data same time you see yourself . what i , since i not very happy images my panasonic produced ! i this camera 11 months 20 days exactly , today i traded it nikon p5000 after evaluating over dozen models including leica d-lux3 10mp camera , driving sales persons crazy all testing spending 4 hours store , but it very educational them too	-1

i spend hours pouring over reviews trying decide which ultracompact best deal best overall camera . end , it came down panasonic fx01 cannon sd600 . i read warnings other reviewers panasonic images weren't top quality , but i chose ignore those reviewers because paper fx01 looks like it would out perform sd600 . i wrong . after using fx01 few days i knew what those other reviewers talking - grainy photo after grainy photo . i really really wanted this camera great , but it just wasn't . actually , my old 3mp camera took better shots then 6mp fx01 ! very disappointing . i ended up returning this camera amazon ( very easy-great service ) because poor image quality . i mean , wanting good photographs why you take photos , right ? i know someone sd600 he very happy quality . judging customer images sd600 page amazon , i think i should've gone cannon	-1

owner sony dcr-hc30 model dv handicam , i want warn everyone my horrible experience this product line . design feature-wise , these handicams great . problem , they built like junk . day i opened my box , i got message told me heads dirty needed cleaned . retrospect , i should returned it replacement then there . but basically optimistic guy , i decided it just got dirty transit , i got head cleaner cleaned heads . it worked fine 30 days - just amount time sony crappy labor warranty . point forward , i gotten dirty head messages constantly , which first could `cleaned away , ' but now , even when message gone , problems persist . i often get bars across screen during playback , i already determined i lost many precious memory my infant children . sony solution this situation their standard " flat rate " repair program , truly bargain $250 or so - more than half what i paid camera first place . sony wonders why their brand value all but disappeared ? they just electronics brand now , one sub-par quality service . guess i'll buying samsungs or canons next time around . you listening , sony ?	-1

i bought this lens my canon powershot g5 , because it requires use long adapter , not only it cause terrible vignetting ( circle other poster thought cool , but which actually design flaw ) unless you zoom most way , it blocks built-in flash . i owned four canon cameras over past 15 years , g5 everything related it huge disappointment . ( i would bought digital rebel when it first came out so i could use my eos lenses , but it didn't allow flash exposure compensation ( insane $1000 camera body ) . ) i not recommend this lens or any g-series digital cameras canon . when i've got money i'll buying latest digital rebel upgrading some my old eos lenses , selling my entire powershot kit . if you experienced photographer , you not like this system all	-1
i feel it just way too much money what you get . i own lot professional ( canon ) equipment gladly paid price because they best things out there . but it makes little sense market marginal product still expect command high price . i s80 . no complaint there . leather case just way too tight , which invites fumble you try pull out camera . flap issue issue . neck chain bit short , similar better items lower price . if you shop around you also find li battery less . i'm not upset , but just disappointed what i got price	-1

if you going lay out $500 camera , you should expect fair amount camera . however , i few gripes here . first , there no remote control it which makes setting up shot tough . all nikons series use wireless remote . you buy underwater case those magnificent nikons so you shoot underwater . you get over 10 megapixels d80 , or d200 you get great nikkor lens . you don't get much lens dc500 , 5 megapixels don't get you very far when it comes printing publication quality images . lets face it : this expensive point-n-shoot camera tourist , not serious camera . nuff said . -	-1
sure my canon sd-30 super cute i get lots compliments how small sexy it , but heaven forbid you want take pictures it !! this camera cannot take pictures low light all ! every picture i've taken parties out focus , which adds up lot hazy photos great memories . i took it back camera shop guy said i setting right but " yeah , they don't work well low light . " well if i needed bright sunny day every shot i could make pinhole camera out cardboard box ! pictures it takes daylight nice . but anyone who wants tiny little camera like this planning putting it their pocket taking it parties ! i got sony cybershot 10.1 it takes great pictures low light . later , canon .	-1

i recently bought this lens amid trepidation 85mm focal length would overwhelm 1.6 crop factor my digital rebel xl . my worries needless : just step or two back subject plus some getting used telephoto perspective enough turn this lens into most effective portrait lens i . when attached my eos elan 7n film camera , however , lens really truly comes into its own , full frame 35mm slr delivers entire focal range this lens . focused image incredibly crisp compared any other non-l grade lens . i agree this lens deserves red ring courage around it , like lenses . this glass absolutely essential very short list affordable lenses , should give many non-affordable ones run their money . solidly built too , old-fashioned no-nonsense look it . i highly recommend it	1
i enjoy tc80n3 . you may think it costly , but features out standing . i think it worth buy . only disappointment i there no " , off " power switch	1
this very powerful flash unit works master other canon flash units . you get very nice results small amount experimentation . it what it suppose . i used it 420ex i've several years it worked fine . mounted camera it larger version built popup 30d some extra niceties lots more power . thinking 430ex ? cough up few extra bucks this baby , you'll glad you . it one shot deal , [ no pun intended ] , you'll using it years come . i bought 420ex my elan ii 6 years ago . it great unit . this one recharges faster gobs more power . you'll love it ! don't let all dials switches scare you , read instruction manual	1
i use this little gadget mainly macro portrait work . when you it light emitting flash diffused which gives you more flattering less contrasty light illuminate your subjects . unless you going very shadowy , high-contrast , image this diffuser save day . it very light weight easy pack small places , so you should never good reason leave it behind . sometimes it simple things make biggest difference photo , using this defiantly make very noticeable differences	1
when i bought this camera sales people tried get me buy battery . they said one came it would only good 20 minutes . now i bought alot items my lifetime , 20 min battery camera just doesnt seem like very good " business " choice . so i said no . so i got camera , charged battery until light went green ( which sucked because i wanted play it right when i got it ) started taking pictures ( oh i also got 2g cf ) worked great .... so i planned go up mountain take soem scenery shots . keeping mind what sales person told me i pocketed charger just incase . well , 6000 ' , 300 pictures , 5 hours later camera still running strong , still 200 shots left trip home , battery life indicator hasnt budged off full button . so all all , i think battery life great , now i see if your taking say thousands pictures all row you may need but just going trip shooting few pictures every stop point , original work fine . quality photos ..... i love them	1
i gone old 640x480 nine years ago 3.1 last few years canon 20d now , what pleasure shot . battery life not issue even over 250 shots , which should sufficient most anybody . there small learning curve but you would expect this any new camera . lens choice great idea which came earlier review excellent walk around ability this lens general shots closeups those favorite flowers . those individuals who fence this product i tout it all i spoken . it turned good photo experience our west coast road trip into real serious photo shoot , it also uses commonly accessable compact flash . built flash works well not explore options this time . delivery this item when promised nice bow package	1
i shoot canon 20d used canon ef 75-300mm f/ 4.5 - 5.6 iii usm lens . i've always noticed limitations this lens when shooting amateur softball . i reviewed lens lineup canon website decided canon ef 100-400mm f/ 4.5 - 5.6 usm lens . 100-400mm great lens , but it bit soft . reason i decided add canon ef 70-200mm 2.8 /f usm telephoto zoom lens my lens collection . this serious lens meant serious photographers . lens , there lot features manufactured better materials high level dust moisture resistance . construction sturdy consists 23 elements 18 groups . four super ud-glass elements largely eliminate secondary spectrum reducing residual chromatic aberration . improved 8-blade circular aperture offers more pleasing out-of-focus image . canon ef 70-200mm lens weighs 3.24 lbs/ 1,470 , accepts 77mm filters minimal focusing distance 4.3 ft/ 1.3 . this lens compatible extenders 1.4 ii 2x ii . sure get good quality uv haze filter protect front lens element . white , this lens looks bit strange , but helps keep it stay cool when shooting sun . some people concerned white , it attracts attention criminals . my experience , my 20d attracts attention regardless what lens i put it . addition , i most likely camera bag tripod/monopod me further attract attention . i personally doubt thief looking something steal taking time evaluate cost item more concerned ease taking something they unload . i try make things difficult would thieves insurance back up . dual system two modes . mode 1 stationary subjects while mode two moving subjects . it recommended function not used tripod ; however i used it my monopod success . helps eliminate camera shake helps stabilize lens when shooting moving vehicle . while there limitations what , it give you few extra stops . just keep mind , attempts eliminate camera movement , not movement subject photographed . this lens permits auto or manual focus depending how switch set . there also switch shift 1.4 m/ 4.6 ft infinity or 2.5 m/ 8.2 ft infinity . included this lens tripod mount , lens hood , storage case . tripod mount best option use when mounting tripod . this helps balance load . mounting camera instead creates unbalanced set up may topple over . case zippered soft case ( lz1324 ) also purchased separately . lens hood ( et-86 ) used reduce lens flare protect front element certain situations . often times , amazon recommends purchasing lens case hood , however they normally included lens . canon ef 70-200mm such awesome lens , it almost fails compare canon ef 75-300mm . canon 100-400mm lens well used option me , but clarity sharpness 70-200mm lens more refined . auto-focus quiet quick . this lens used portraits , landscape , sports or general walk lens . f/ 2.8 combined makes this good option certain low light situations . features add creative versatility . canon ef 70-200mm lens comes price , but it worth every bit it . pros : incredible clarity sharpness quiet quick auto-focus features add creative versatility dual system cons : heavy bulky ( this should expected these types lenses	1
i bought this lens whim see what it would like shoot prime lens . $80 it certainly worth risk unlike many other canon lenses which cost thousands dollars . quality pictures this lens only thing making me move away zoom lenses	1

hoods offer several benefits photographer . primarily hood shades lens stray light may result unwanted discoloration or hazing image , or appearance lens flare . shading your lens helps improve contrast image quality . hood not required eliminate these problems , any item used shade lens provide same protection stray light . hood convenient it built offer protection while ensuring it not inadvertently find its way into your image . photographers often state protective abilities hood reason one . this hood solid petal shaped offers limited protection keeping moisture wind blown debris off lens element . when place , hood protect lens impacting solid objects . shallow petal shaped , this type protection also limited . even if protection limited , replacing damaged hood usually cheaper than repairing lens easier replace . this hood manufactured canon 28-135mm f/ 3.5 - 5.6 ef normally not included lens when sold new . amazon often suggests purchasing one your lens , worth considering . since hood wider than lens ; it easily stored attached reverse position . this doesn't add length lens , but make it wider inch . inch may not seem like lot , but tightly packed camera bag , it huge . this lens itself isn't unusually wide so extra inch may not problem . while protective benefits exist , they secondary limited . i find impact hood my image quality more convincing reason use hood . considering impact image quality low cost compared my other camera equipment ( except lens case ) , purchasing hood money well spent . pros : improves contrast image quality reduces lens flare problems offers limited protection lens cons : takes up more space your camera bag store lens	1
this wonderful bag photographer wants light weight bag still hold lot lenses or bodies . bag slings around front allowing user easily switch out lenses without unload entire bag or worry dropping expensive lense . also , bag hold lot accessories . i canon rebel xt bodies 3 lenses just camera compartment . flap opens up user when bag your chest memory card holder , but it hold 8 memory cards which huge ! top small pouch where you tuck away larger objects like water bottle or map . all weather bag cover built into bag so you not worry folding it up storing it . bag cover also velcro pulls latches it onto bag so it stays insuring dry environment inside bag . basically this top notch bag get through anything . yes , i actually used bag few trips find it very user friendy reasonable	1
my all-around favorite lens canon eos system 50/ 1.4 . i find most time , most pictures i want take achieved using hte 50mm focal length , fast aperture allows me take photos low light . i bought 24-70/ 2.8 hopes getting high quality images zoom lens , lot my pictures weren't particularly dark places , flexibility get little wider or closer sounded appealing . i not disappointed . image quality produced 24-70/ 2.8 outstanding . great color , great sharpness . it might not make images quite striking canon 135/2 lens , but they very good indeed . this lens replace 50/ 1.4 ? no way . 50 lot smaller , weighs lot less , still much better low light shooting . but photographing events where you don't want lug around several prime lenses or go extreme lenghts frame shot better , 24-70 great tool	1
i purchased this photographic store because professional said you shouldn't go higher than 1.4 . just keep mind -- 1.4 only " 40% better " . it worked really well , but didn't increase zoomage enough . i decided go 2x ( that twice zoomage ) teleconverter kenko instead . i gave this one my brother-in-law christmas . you think what you want -- i want get really close birds . i 70-300mm zoom lens 1.4 takes it 98-420mm . it improvement , but not nearly enough ! if you want get twice close , this isn't going it you . if you want get half-again-as close , this almost gets you there . far quality , quality definitely there . five stars quality , 3 insufficient zoomage	1
it good my title says , however , i found one con it there no place i put string it so i put it my pocket when i take it off	1
this camera potential pictures amazing clarity colors but not straight out camera . i too disappointed after converting raw files c1 pro acr . it possible my d-rebel would better than this monster gives me neck pains made my right arm start looking like swartzenegger arm ? even glass results dissapointing . problem not camera but workflow . after using it 2 months i am getting used workflow give me results i am looking . i realize this camera not perform any processing enhancements camera because pros need it themselves . once i got over fact i would sharpen saturate colors lot more than before i content never touched d-rebel ever since . ps beware severe neck pains when attaching any zoom lens . buy hand strap or better neck strap . some photo samples found here : http://www.trekearth.com/members/nbournas/photos	1
i gave this monopod my boyfriend , gift , it perfect his use . he videotapes his kids baseball softball games , tired holding camcorder so long . he didn't want deal bulky tripod when he getting up down , so monopod seemed like great idea . he loved it !! he says it keeps camera very steady it very easy change height so he use it sitting or standing . he no professional , but he uses his camcorder lot , he'll happily using monopod long time	1
my cousin wife professional studio photographer who occasionally lends out her lenses me clothing / lifestyle photoshoots ( i've pretty active this area some time , just now starting go full digital ) , i've used f/ 2.8 four or five times this one best lenses i've used . period . shooting wide open allows you retain high shutter speeds night shots , well get very interesting vibrant long shutter shots ( crowds , freeway night , etc ) . when shooting action shots , tripod mount get way zooming focusing , but it removed easily enough . i personally just purchased f/ 4.0 , which , coupled relatively wide max aperture shooting either 1600 or 3200 my 20d , should nicely , but i still rate 2.8 high up my list	1
balance grip really much better . yes i am aware there problems some earlier ones , but mine seems just fine ( knocking wood i type )	1
i recently purchased this use my 550ex . if you use alot flash event photography , you want this your kit . it expensive , but i think it worth every penny . it keep you changing aas your strobe it quickens recycle times nearly instant . you shoot bursts still get proper flash exposure . you attach strap sling it over your shoulder or slip it your belt . mounting my 20d just not comfortable . it gets way hand-grip	1
this great lens any user , professional or amateur . this lens offers incredibly wide focal lengths all while giving very impressive/clean results . slight distortion noticeable when shooting 10mm ( 16mm cropped ) but this easily correctable software . addition , very fast absolutely silent usm huge plus . i highly recommend this lens anyone wanting great landscapes or great door/architecture shots ( especially realtors )	1
if you don't need speed or can't afford expensive 85mm 1.4 nikkor lens or both , then this lens may right one you . it took nikon while produce superb compact 85mm lens , but this time they finally got it right . without doubt , this fine portrait lens photographing head-and-shoulder portraits ( only lens which optically better nikon legendary 105mm 2.5 nikkor lens , its close optical twin , 105mm 2.8 micro nikkor . ) . since 105mm 2.5 nikkor lens doesn't autofocus version , then this might perfect moderate telephoto lens owners nikon autofocus slr cameras . regardless , this lens well-earned reputation excellent contrast resolution	1
i bought this lens go my canon digital rebel xt . i absolutely love this lens . i got it try some insect other macro shots it served this purpose very well . some practice this lens produce fantastic macros some great bokeh boot . i read other reviews must say i never scared insect away noise mentioned before . i taken countless insect shots this lens . it bit louder than other lenses i but i don't see it problem . one problem i encounter when using autofocus busy closeup scene it often focus background instead say closer insect flower . when this happens i just flip it manual focus way . no big deal . overall , great lens even greater price . definitely worth it . ( i submitted photo bee i took couple days ago this lens example . )	1
i bought this hood after reading elsewhere it fits 50mm f/ 1.8 mark i ( version metal mount distance scale ) i purchased recently . canon specs discontinued es-65 hood this lens . great thing this et-65iii it longer , so it blocks more stray light without vignetting full-frame or 1/6-frame slrs . interior this mark iii version also flocked , providing bit more light absorption . i've used those collapsible rubber hoods before while college , but this hood definitely worth investment : well built , fits backward lens storage ( but too long while lens camera ) , provides good protection front lens ( it quite deep ) . note this not fit newer 50mm f/ 1.8 mark ii version ( all plastic mount no distance scale )	1
hi rebel extreme , needed use high-speed mode ... but flash couldn't even vaguely keep up . i taking pictures dancers , so needed flash system could keep up . speedlite really this perfectly - i'm able take rapid-fire sequence photos , this flash system there each time . i don't know if it really helps when taking single photo , but if you want flash keep up , this one great ! i like it so much , i'm planning buying one or two more my next shoot , run slave mode this one .	1
i cannot help but giggle when i saw comments like " great lens money " . it selling $440 here , even so-called clearance . however , one easily find same lens least $50 cheaper some decent online camera store , such bh , ritz camera , etc . sad amazon ..	1
i am 67 years old started out photography kid contact printer box camera . i all types cameras over years , mostly 35mm film canon slr . i too bought all sorts these 5-7 mp point shoot digital cameras before returning my true love , slr . i my digital canon rebel xt month now i can't keep my hands off it . it lacks nothing . although kit lense good , i bought 28-135 canon zoom lense image stabilizion produced stunning photo it . i love way you use 7 points focus , i mainly use only center point focus lock never get out focus picture . i guess nicest thing me i now don't urge buy every point shoot camera paraded out qvc or hsn " wonderful " new feature like " low light or non-shake . " this canon every good feature known universe you can't outgrow it . its camera let you good you , it won't hold you back . battery life great , built flash good but i bought 430ex that even better . i never figure i'm wasting money buying accessories this camera it my main squeeze many years come . i always missed my 35mm canon slr now feel i old friend back again , only much much better . believe me , you can't go wrong getting this camea , its beyond description ...	1
when digital cameras first came out , i , like many people swore i'd always loyal film . digital could never take place film . i'm not convinced it replaced film completely . there still something i love putting roll film camera , shooting away , sending film processed , seeing results . i also know it bit expensive . i know argument quality always paramount discussion , but digital cameras improving this regard , most manufacturers assuring users while technology always improving , we point where good investment made digital slr it not outdated soon buyer purchases camera . so i figured now time get digital slr . i loyal nikon user nearly ten years , owned nikon n60 , n70 , n80 . my first love , still n70 ( i've told person who sold me camera he thought i only person who loved n70 ) . i purchased n80 only after my n70 cost too much repair , but i've enjoyed way my various nikon cameras handled all sorts situations fact they simple use point shoot if i don't time use specific controls , but it also options more creative artistic purposes . my nikon cameras allowed me capture family moments ease majestic landscapes , wildlife shots all sorts other things i can't resist capture forever . i decided purchase d70 since it close what i've already experienced nikon . many ways it works similar way n70 80 , except it digital rather than film version . like film versions midrange nikon slr , it dial allows automatic setting , portrait , landscape , sports , close-up , nightscape , night portrait modes , ability select aperture , shutter speed or manual controls . camera auto manual focus abilities . photos easy or technical photographer desires . controls easy use , though it takes practice comfortable . personal level , camera passed halloween test , niece birthday test , fall foliage new england test favorite scenic spots test . only real difficulty i've camera trying capture stained glass windows dark setting . auto focus not worked all i'm not thrilled manual focus these shots , but this point i'm sure it photographer not camera . i one suggestion anyone who purchases this camera . manual very confusing . it uses all sorts symbols more distraction than anything else . i've luck " magic lantern guides " my other cameras , but not yet used it this camera . i purchase nikon d70 field guide ( david busch , wiley publishing ) which helpful . it quick reference anyone already familiar nikon photography general but it also provides introduction novice photography .	1
i switched digital rebel xt . since i already l-glass lenses , i didn't run into problems 5d " exposing " cheaper lenses . 17-40mm really shines full sensor ! burst rate simply astonishing . missing flash doesn't bother me , heck it $3000 camera , i don't expect built-in flash . i speedlite 580ex , which course wonderful itself . i also battery grip which i recommend , well rs-80n3 cable release . image quality superb overall - 5d really shines high iso numbers - more so than even 1d what i've read . even 1600 there hardly any noise . it allows you take great , crisp photos low light where other cameras would require flash . camera also quite light while very sturdy same time . 3 fps might bother some , but i prefer incredible burst numbers .	1
it everything it reported . it works very well . we take it every trip we take	1
i received my 28-200 yesterday amazon . read customer reviews , i immediately put my rebel xt tripod ran two series comparison shots 28-200 my canon 28-135 . three shots each f-stops 5.6 , 11 , 20 , one set indoors iso 1600 other outdoors iso 200 . focal length 135 using same scenes each camera , highest jpeg setting . after shooting both series , i compared them fresh out camera , side side . results : 28-200 least sharp 28-135 both foreground background most instances . it visibly sharper iso 200 f-stops 5.6 20 , ( 28-135 took honors f-stop 10 ) , 20 , it visibly sharper both foreground background . 28-135 one-stop faster shutterwise . both lenses produced pictures which would sharpen nicely photoshop . there vagaries autofocus different shooting conditions consider ; different test scenes conceivably produce different results . my conservative conclusion : 28-200 good it gets super-zoom your canon ( unless you going drop $2200 series 28-300 carry it ) , 28-135 no clear sharpness advantage . these lenses , its tradeoff --- extra 65 mm focal length ( 105 mm after 1.6 conversion ) versus image stabilization low-light shooting capability . both lenses focus quickly silently , both lenses produce usable shots .	1
my sony dscw100 camera small but very functional user friendly , it makes photography easy interesting hobby .	1
it pretty convinient bag . i put canon rebel xt tamron 28-75 lens , canon 70-300 lens external flash inside i still small pocket wallet , keys etc . only drawback this bag , you not put big lenses . canon 70-300 limit . but if you only limited gear collection , you need give it try	1
this excellent device . quick respond my d80 . i use it take family pictures include me . i just point press this remote activate d80 timer it works beautifully	1
i not actually taken this underwater yet , but it appears well made similar quality other cases . it keeps theover-all size camera/case down size could fit into bc pocket . downside , it only limited functionality camera through available buttons . you zoom telephoto , change camera , playback movie mode shoot picture . you cannot any setup functions while it case . regarding stobe , sony makes one looks little cheezy . there " universal " strobe sea life ( sl 960d ) fits , but fiber-optic trigger just taped onto flash camera . i'm waiting how this works . one replacement o-ring comes case-replacements sony outrageously expensive . color-correcting ( red ) lenses $100 sony , but not needed if you use strobe . ( unless maybe shoot movies ? )	1
i am certainly happy i bought this filter kit . starting photographer , price right , i not noticed any quality issues . uv filter stays lens all times , it cheaper replace filter , than it scratched lens element repaired . light polarizer very handy , also works very well , cutting down greatly glare . i not yet occasion use warming filter yet . filter case nice extra , it fits right my camera bag , out way untill i need it	1
well , i've my rebel xti 6weeks now , all i say wow !!! i rebel xt , which awesome camera . i'm not professional , but i take pictures what ever it may outside or inside , youth or adult events hobby . this camera not person who wants just point shoot or camera stuff your pocket . this camera creative person who wants control pictures they taking . sensor cleaner wide lcd just few wonderful advances xt xti . camera me easy use takes great pictures auto mode or my mode . i hope this helps you your decision whether buy or not .	1
i just bought digital rebel month ago . love camera , my old 380ex speedlight integrates camera but just doesn't offer enough cycle speed keep up continuous mode rebel . this flash job rebel plug external battery pack promises even better performance once i grab item . big selling point really makes this unit worth cash , it its own infrared focus assist lamp which digital rebel lacks . when this flash mounted your digital rebel , you don't get annoying set quick flashes camera set off focus low light when using built-in flash . rebel body uses infrared focus assist 550ex focus lens ; this feature alone worth big bucks this baby costs . flash tons features most us might never use , but advanced amateur i'm glad they're there so i play if i should choose try out some fancy stuff . wireless slave capability handy but you've got least one more 420ex , 550ex or 580ex use . i like digital readout back flash also two way bounce head , it important note you press button make head turn either side side or up/down --- this should make head sturdier than i've seen some units get loose after awhile drive you nuts . this unit honker -- really big , , no lightweight either . get yourself big deep camera bag if you want lug this thing around you . what difference this 580ex ? 580 very slightly faster cycle times offers some fancy new automatic flash exposure bracketing modes , me anyway it wasn't worth almost two hundred dollars more 580 . all newer eos camera bodies fully supported this unit , it also works older eos bodies but there functions available newer ones aren't there older stuff . i like this flash it covers well , cycles fast controls fairly intuitive easy use . when you get yours don't lose book , canon doesn't seem them online anywhere i find i've seen places want charge you 18 bucks new one	1
im graphic design student college , so i really needed camera . i decided this one i am really glad i . pictures nice clean . camera itslef very sleek looking one very compact . only downfall this it eats batteries pretty quick , but i just took them out when i wasnt using them . buy this camera	1
this one first lenses i purchased my rebel xt . now after taking several thousand pictures it i honestly say it well worth cost . i very rarely any unsharp pictures this lens unless it my own fault trying use too slow shutter speed without tripod . i also 180mm f/ 3.5 macro lens , which costs 3 times more than this lens , although it very clear extra reach nice times especially since it used both 1.4 2x tc , it very difficult use inside without tripod . 60mm handheld if needed very good results even if you bump your iso up little so . i also used this lens both inside outside portrait work very nice results . all-in-all , given it small size light weight i very rarely leave this lens behind when i go out because you never know when you might see great macro shot	1
i took this me recently australia shot landscapes well others , pictures came out better than film cameras i used recently , plus you don't need scanner . this camera works great , must semi-pros . pros , wait new 1d . pictures come out great 11quot ; x17quot ;	1

this just plain sweetheart lens . it covers useful 18-35 mm range ( which 27-52mm nikon digital slr , which very useful range ) . this lens costs less than half price ( expensive ) professional nikon 17-35 , almost nice job . sufficiently nice , fact , most amateurs not discern much , if any , difference . while not built like tank , i think quality construction this one excellent , more than adequate enthusiastic amateurs even some pros . nikon digital slr , which use center portion this lens ( due size sensor slr ) you expect excellent , even spectacular results . this fabulous lens landscape nature shots , portraits , or just plain walking around taking pictures . someone who only wanted one lens not telephoto could much worse than select this excellent , versatile lens . this one great parties , vacations , works . images i shot this lens all featured superb contrast , very sharp , beautiful color rendition . there just not lot not like this lens . i give it 4 stars overall performance , but 5 stars value price/performance . some lenses just get it all together work become keepers . this one those	1
easily snaps place job . considerably less expensive than local retail outlet - delivery quick well	1
i wish i'd bought this loooong time ago ! it so helpful , esp . macro shots . highly recommend	1
this elegant leather case canon elph cameras . it fits pocket easily . i'm satisfied	1
though lenses my nikon d50 not expensive some they still several hundred dollars this uv protection filter protecting lens glass made whole lot sense . i feel less stress when i clean filter lens than if i wiping dust dirt actual lens glass . this size , 52mm , what specified my d50 it fits perfectly , it should . i no complaints all manufacturer or seller . if you new digital slr like i then get this filter protect your lens . spend your time worrying sensor when you need switch out your lens .	1
i not repeat what other reviews stated already , all reviews below pretty much correct this camera high quality easy use etc etc . only issue focusing small target such name brand logo inside rolex watch . it hard even manual mode ( i actually alot digital camera experience ) . forget trying focus auto mode , it won't happen .. least not without alot tinkering stress . if you need take alot close up pictures small detailed items ( jewelery , insects , etc . ) then i recommend buying digital slr camera , nikon d50 good one ! this fuji you looking here perfect taking pictures normal things like people , cars , buildings , sites , etc	1

i needed lens hood my 50mm lens paying $25 hood $75 lens might seem ridiculous . however , might because $75 lens so inexpensive . if lens $250 then paying extra 10% might not seem too bad . i just saw total cost lens hood $100 that good terrific prime lens its hood . however , please note : lens hood rather shallow ( 1 star reduction ) it screw-on two piece kit ( 1 star reduction ) . one piece adaptor screws-on where filters normally go ( uv filter ) front lens intended permanent integral part lens second piece hood snaps off this adaptor . adaptor ring retains same 52mm rim size so your protective filter go before or after adaptor . ( 1 bonus star ) because $100 still bargain 50mm , 1.8 , super fast , super sharp , super clear , light weight beginner lens hood kit ! i hope this helps rather than confuse . :)	1
i working major daily newspaper baltimore 2 decades . perhaps qualify me expert photography . i shooting digital imagery since late 1990s . maybe qualifies me expert digital photography . this may long- winded , but it extensive useful . i received nikon d2h camera -- 2 bodies total -- over one year ago . i think i got them shortly after d2h system released 2003 . since then , i used them shoot images all types -- documentary , sports , daytime , available light , flash , dead- of- night -- paper i work . this only camera i work . first , please read manual . there ton information there , information terrific begin . d2h highly- configurable , screen after screen you set your own specific use ( resist lending camera anyone long period time , your camera may returned many your settings changed so much it acts like thoroughly different camera ) . i'll just punch right way it feels . camera rather heavy beast , some , there amount shoulder or neck fatigue when using it hours per day , like i . but camera feels well hand controls easy move through . i've long since given up using any camera bag . all i fanny pack 14mm , 55mm , teleconverters 2 extra camera batteries flashes clipped its belt . d2h hold 17-35mm nikon 80-200mm nikon one- touch or sigma 120-300mm 2- touch . shooting breeze . batteries let you shoot long before need recharge . i my d2h set iso 200 or 400 most time sacrifice shutter speed lower iso often i , because higher isos bring digital noise loss color saturation . just today , i purchased digital noise plug ins photoshop limit this , that wonderful thing invest this camera when you must shoot action photography no flash iso 800 above . i now little problems capturing images even barely- limited lighting . i recently shot stars plane wing my seat airbus 36,000 feet over pacific 30 seconds wide open @ f/ 2.8 , it looks tons better than night shots via d1h , which lacked internal digital noise filter . filter kicks around 1/2 second longer exposures , make you wait long your image you've shot strip your long exposure much digital noise . when you shoot this way ( general ) , don't simply react cranking up iso because you not happy your results . camera loud . over 7 frames per second , it make you obvious quiet room . shooting sensitive situations testy , so limit your shooting single frames . i wish this camera option silence this camera , but since mirror raise lower , there no chance this . am i happy d2h ? definitely , yes . there improvements made ? yes . but benefits outweigh drawbacks . people bailing out using nikon system going canon , which some incredible gear , i won't deny . but instead simply giving up your system equipment , learn how use d2h well you'll much happier than ever . means you should push its qualities max while respecting its limitations . instance , white balance . this best thing you , or worst thing you've ever dealt , depending upon how you approach it . daylight , grey skies , dusk dawn easy , because you set camera daylight , flash , shadow ( dusk dawn times ) even fluorescent incandescent tend right ballpark . but horrible mixed light or street lamps glow blue/green or orange- red mercury vapor death image if you don't properly use white balance . preset white balance king , here . i get grey , black white when i preset mercury vapor light . i used preset any light auto white balance setting can't figure . there also setting dial kelvin temps well ! if you this ( i go miles here ) , you're your way . so , trying this d2h , or considering it , read through some digital d2h forums ignore posts slam camera without giving instances . generally , those who pan camera not tried understand it . i bang off images disprove where they suggest this camera fail . when you decent light , you'll decent image . but when you try use it without learning how you maximize system , you come shooting images terrible unprintable . closing , i not paid anyone , i no nikon stock no outside interest writing this except i'm giving d2h credit where it long overdue	1
my 2 year old really active my point shoot camera cannot keep up him . i also don't like washout look when i uses flash . so i researched which slr best meet my needs , mainly catching fast action , candid moments low light photos without flash . canon 30d comes up top list . it best high iso performance its class ( better than nikon sony ) . when i combine 30d fast zoom lens ef-s 17-55 mm f/ 2.8 , result amazing . i stop any action daylight , capture every candid expression my 2 yr old fast burst mode , take indoor or night photos without using flash or tripod . portraits also excellent sharp image beautifully blurred background ( bokeh ) . even dimly-lit decors disneyland haunted mansion came out superb when we went there halloween party night , without flash or tripod . this really important factor me buy this camera , taking pictures tripod not option when your subject active 2 yr old . but you need good lens make this work well . if you use cheap kit lens , then it probably not matter which camera you pick . remember these 3 all very good cameras small differences image quality you see reviews apparent only when they use best prime lens ( not kit lens)and crop pictures magnify details . sony very good choice if you budget don't need low light performance ( use flash save money ) . nikon more custom function than canon , it really good canon . they both their strength weakness . canon just happens slightly better high iso performance suits my need better than nikon . fair , i should mention nikon d200 tops most reviews camera year , beating canon 30d overall . but d200 bit too advanced amateur like me , better suits someone more serious photography . d80 like " mini " d200 , but slower . so it really boils down what you really need how much you want spend . shooting low light without flash need good high iso performance , good fast lens ( wide aperture , usually expensive ) , image stabilization . if that what you want , canon 30d ef-s 17-55 mm f/ 2.8 not disappoint you	1
i purchased this lens take photographs vintage wristwatches . i use original canon digital rebel shots really very detailed . it easy use fact , i hand hold camera capture details hand-made craftsmanship watches . its 2.5 opening welcome change when you use shooting zoom lens it quite sharp edge edge . if you own canon digital slr want pocket some extra coin then this lens you .	1
i don't much stuff , but fits all my dslr gadgets plus my camcorder . fits - my canon xti my canon 50 mm attached . - my kit lens- my new canon 70-300 is- my panasonic video cam- minor accessories ( extra batteries , cables , memory cards , etc)there separators velcros inside , so you configure bag however you want i t.t he only issue i this bag i wan't able configure it store my xti my 70-300 attached	1
if you big lenses ( 400mm f/ 2.8 usm or even 70-200mm f/ 2.8 usm ) this totally worth addition . 2x not kill autofocus f/ 2.8 effectively doubles your lens very little distortion around edges . check compatability canon website . you won't disappointed	1
now , this isn't fastest card market . but it solid , reliable card . camera itself bottle kneck , typically not this card . however , if you using canon dslr recent flavor , i would check if it needs rma'd . known quantity these cards proven lose images . scary . however , i've not experienced mysterious loss images my card or rebel xt . i've only ever pushed cards speed limits my pd70x , definately not my rebel xt	1
i'm new digital slr world . i using built flash my rebel xt . built-in flash alright , but nothing write home . since i spent most my money camera , i needed flash both affordable would get job . this flash met both requirements . if you advance user , you want higher end flash because flash limited adjuastable features . yet , if you newbie like me , this flash great ! it improved my picture quality dramaticly .	1
this lens outstanding . speed sharpness top-notch . i use this lens wide array situations it always delivered impressive results . best lens it class reasonable price . it well built , sturdy , not so heavy so it relatively easy carry around . canon really impressed me this lens . i use it my eos system ( traditional digital cameras ) .	1
pure image quality standpoint , this lens not please pixel peepers . wide end zoom , which i personally use more often than telephoto end , this lens not very sharp , it suffers fairly bad distortion . worse than , me , chromatic abberations ; this lens quite prone significant ca when shot wide end , which look lot worse than little bit distortion or softness . given price this lens , one should expect higher level optical performance . maximum aperture this lens not very large , f/4 wide end , f/ 5.6 telephoto end . image stabilization makes up this some , you comfortably shoot much slower shutter speeds than otherwise , but , let honest here ; this lens poor performer if you want shoot low light no tripod . small aperture makes dark viewfinder , which very big problem if you trying compose picture dark ( using tripod ) . yet , i still gave this very imperfect lens four stars , this not without reason . first all , focal length range quite handy . it isn't mega-zoom everything , however , it covers most often used focal length ranges , appropriate lens use vast majority situations . little bit extra zoom telephoto end handy occasion , it also worth noting lens sharpens up quite bit when you zoom some - it might soft wide end , but zoomed , it quite good . i printed large 20x30 " using this lens digital rebel , no qualms results . yes , there sharper lenses out there , but you lot more likely see difference sharpness your computer monitor than prin t.t his lens ring usm , which enables it focus very quietly , very quickly , whereas slightly cheaper ( 2.8 ) options 3rd parties normal focusing motors slow noisy comparison . if you want use this lens indoors , you best off getting flash go it , such 430ex . lens usable fantastic indoor lighting , or during day , but won't give you good results low light no flash . if you shooting lower light situations ( people particular ) , tamron sigma some good options 17-50mm range 2.8 apertures , i would recommend those lenses over this one . if you'd prefer extra telephoto range , image stabilization so you shoot smaller aperture poorer lighting situations greater depth field ( instead needing shoot landscape f/4 , instance , without image stabilization , you could use f/11 this lens , get sharp picture better depth field . this even more useful close focus range - while this isn't true macro lens , if you take closeup photos without tripod , you want stop lens down greater depth field , helps quite bit . overall , i've fairly pleased performance this lens . if you like worry splitting hairs , zooming all way pictures your computer , this lens likely dissapoint you . if , however , you willing sacrifice optical perfection get very well rounded , useful lens , then i'd recommend it , however , would also recommend you consider 3rd party options , they also great lenses , offer somewhat better value	1
i received tripod ahead expected schedule . i've looking tripods stores around greater boston area . you can't get better tripod money . fact , you can't get anything " decent " under $40-50 even then i'm not sure you get something this good . i it shipped my job few guys office ( which i didn't know ) purchased tripod past where really impressed when i told them i only paid $25 it . conclusion : tripod perfect , no . head looks little like plastic . but it nice rubber feet rubber grip addition everything listed website . this tripod perfect beginner enthusiast photographer .	1
i am impressed quality photos this camera . occaisionally when i turn it lense doiesn't slide out , which little disconcerting . however , if i tap it , or turn it off turn it o again , it comes out operational position . i enjoy using it , amd wouldn't hesitate purchase one	1
if you're looking high-quality telephoto zoom lens fast enough use indoors , you may found what you're looking . 70-200/ 2.8 lens produces beautiful results overall par 135/2 prime lens ( although not quite sharp ) . main downside this lens it big heavy . i don't mind carrying it around my neck camera so much , but when you go use if you put extra effort into keeping lens shaking your hands due weight . it not exactly sort lens i would want toss into my backpack , just due immense size . if you don't mind spending extra $500 , consider also 70-200/ 2.8 ( image stabilization ) version this lens . it weighs even more , but built unit should help compensate shaky hands whilst using lens	1
balance grip really much better . yes i am aware there problems some earlier ones , but mine seems just fine ( knocking wood i type )	1
i owned this lens year before upgrading image stabilized f/ 2.8 version . overall i very happy f/4 lens miss it available because significantly lower weight . sharpness amazing comparable both lenses , f/4 provide plenty background blur . if you shooting mostly outdoors i would recommend f/4 .	1
i taught photography college level , shoot 4x5 view camera work occasion , am very demanding image quality . i am quite satisfied image quality my kodak p880 , particularly after i installed newest firmware upgrade available kodak . i went through several 7mp 8 mp cameras before finally getting kodak p880 . p880 better image quality than some high end sonys olympus 7-8 mp cameras like dsc-v3 or sp350 . i tested p880 against even higher end 10.3 mp large sensor sony r1 difference image quality 13x19 print p880 r1 barely perceptible after minor sharpening noise reduction , which p880 images accept particularly well . zoom lens very useful range generally pretty sharp throughout its range . balance , manual controls features feel high end adequate most semi-professional needs . camera little slow processing storing pictures raw format exposure bracketing modes but really doesn't bother me because i mostly landscape fine art photos . raw file format directly supported most versions adobe photoshop photoshop elements well most other raw processing programs like bibble pro . unlike most sub-$500 cameras , p880 uses regular screw haze polarizing filters , real plus it highly controllable hot shoe . manual focus usable manual exposure control works well . direct mechanical zoom also nice . overall , p880 digital camera either high end point shoot slr-styled camera or one used fully manually most classic 35 mm film slr . although not small enough slip pocket , size still reasonable light	1
there no question paying $100 or more get you better monopod . but $16 sima smp-1 tremendous value . i sony dsc-w5 digital camera everything i think reduce camera-shake low-light photos . this monopod great adding stability making my photos less blurry . key it small enough light enough i take it almost wherever i go . because it so small , i bring it places would frown upon tripod . monopod not total replacement tripod . but this monopod now only addition my camera i take trips	1
if you're professional photographer , you probably ignore this review . but then you probably won't thinking buying this lens anyway , you'll off purchase nice series . however , if - like me - you just happen nice canon digital rebel camera ( or equivalent ) enjoy taking decent pictures , this lens probably work out very well you . i've taken well over 1000 pictures it couple weeks , it performed very much expected . price , it perfect go-everywhere lens . few main points . okay , it not best image quality . even low/medium iso it seems little grainy its not sharp some more expensive canon lenses . it struggles indoors unless you good flash unit , but well-lit outdoor shoots it works very well . course , it would nice nice series , but if you can't afford then this very good value lens . not real professionals , but great if you don't take things too seriously just want bit more zoom - , let face it , who doesn't want but more zoom	1
i read many reviews fredmiranda.com before i purchased this lens i not dissapointed one bit . i lucky enough receive very sharp copy this lens first try . macro shots very sharp contrasty . center part already reaching near maximum sharpness 2.8 anything beyond f4 tack sharp . carefull this lens though . dof 2.8 extremely narrow . don't mistaken out focus shots unsharp . focus properly crank up aperture you'll get some very satisfying macro shots . only thing i wish this lens image stabilizer . canon , how 100mm macro ?	1
this delivered so fast it unbelievable . they sent exactly what pictured it works perfectly	1
bought this remote month ago . it what it says . you even use it behind . great little device price	1
this thing perfect carrying your stuff around not-so-fattening way . i hvae external flash , macro kit , 28-80 lens , 50mm lens , 18-55mm lens , dslr w/batt grip 75-300mm lens attached all fit into main body this thing . everything seperated dividers making me feel confident safe while walking , hiking , biking , etc . addon pouches seem make it bit more bulking you'd want , but bag all itself fantastic i can't recommend it enough - get away huge bulky shoulder bags !! lowepro it again	1
15 years photography experience here ... sigma 15mm fisheye extensively reviewed compared other websites ( go ahead search ) this very good product . canon tighter focus * touch * faster focusing , but massive depth field this lens , it not problem all . aware if you use this 1.6 crop factor digital slr aps sensors like my 20d or digital rebel , then fisheye effect not pronounced film or 1.3 or full frame digital slrs . watch lens flare should direct sunlight hit it also ... but happens any lens protruding or bulbous lenses . this much better bang buck lens than canon equivalent which costs significantly more . if you search around , you find much lower prices this lens	1
this camera called " pro-sumer " model you should really take title seriously . quality pictures it takes just good professional digital camera same resolution . trade off it really not happy thrown bag ( or big pocket , if it fits ) . why ? because canon given it really annoying power-on switch guaranteed turn camera 90% time when you're moving it or bag . compound this problem , lens extends ( your bag ) , pushing off lens cap leaving it open possible damage . so , if you think this professional camera , kept real camera-case , you'll probably okay . if you're somebody , like me , who likes throw his camera bag or pocket , you're going annoyed power switch . said , i love quality pictures all control camera gives you over every aspect taking them . cons : stupid power-on switch always catches turns camera ; lens cap kind loose falls off easily ; widest angle maybe little too telephoto still ( around 35mm ? )pros : awesome pictures ; tons controls all over outside camera allowing you control lot without resort menus ; professional features including flash hot-shoe replaceable lens ; great battery life ; awesome picture	1
i absolutely love this camera . i've told everyone i know buy it . picture quality amazing . there so many options this tiny little camera ! you edit pictures before you even print them . zoom picture already taken save it way , so much more . i take pictures everything ! i charged battery when i got camera , which three weeks ago , it still going . i 7/8th battery life left . i haven't charge it again . i am so happy my purchase ! i hope this helps you	1
yes it very fine lens . 105 mm long end also appealing but after buying this i decided sell it favour my ef 24-70 2.8 after 2 weeks usage . f4 makes clearly autofocus slower fuzzier . bokeh also worse than other one . viewfinder gets darker 1.6 crop bodies . 105 mm make very little difference image size . plus macro option weaker this one . if you don't care weight go ef 24-70 2.8 imho .	1
price quality i rated this lenses 5 stars . if you really want see how good this lens see photos i took europe . i too around 5000 photos . i posted few web ( see link below ) . price i recommend this lens walk around lens . zoom pretty usefull they very realiable ( almost ) very sharp . get this lens instead kit lens ( 18-55 mm ) until you ready spend more . here some my pictures taken europe this lens ( images compressed ): http://www.laplazita.net/europa/	1
this seemingly simple piece molded plastic recommended me professional photographer . basically it shape open box slides firmly onto flash . it small sturdy enough stash your camera bag without worrying damage . when used light disperses more evenly less harsh subject photographed . white box general use . also available green omni-bounce florescent lighting gold omni-bounce warming effect . pros : inexpensive solution better flash photography . quality product works . cons : non	1
works great orignal battery . you never know difference except lot cheaper !	1
this camera amazing . out 3 digital camera under $150 i've used , this far best , beating out kodak sipix . i originally bought sipix , it junk . don't buy sipix that under $150 . kodak some reason didn't seem like it took good pictures finepix , but software little better , kodak . this camera take pictures resolution up 2 megapixels , but i don't even use option because 1 megapixel pictures so amazing . it comes 16mb removable memory card , so you take around 49 pics 1mp , around 24 2mp , it takes short videos 30 seconds mpeg format 320 160 resolution , or more lower setting . lcd screen easily turned or off save battery power , 2 aa batteries it takes lasts pretty long . it nice , sleak design , software no issues windows xp least . only cons i could think only zoom it 2x digital zoom , which pretty much useless , i never use it , since it same thing zooming your picture viewer your computer . so you consider it not any zoom . software it works well , but it could better , options wise . filenames pictures default number depending its order memory card , so if you transfer pics your computer more than once day ( since it creates folders based date ) , you'll rename each pic . but i hardly complain , since pictures come out so incredibly well . i'm so happy this camera ! if you want camera under $150 , this one get . don't even waste your time kodak , unless you want one 3x optical zoom , but that $200 . i use it general purpose , taking pictures freinds such . once while i take picture sunset 2mp , photo quality printed full page . 1mp creates crisp clear desktop wallpaper size images , . 3mp created good smaller images put websites . there no reason buy anything else , go fuji finepix a200 !	1
let honest ... " kit lens " adds approximately $70 overall price camera body not supposed canon l-series quality . sure , you find better quality lens , but not $70 you can't!i plan use this lens knock around lens allows me get more familiar my camera run off some shots . personally ( this personal preference ) , i find i tend want closer subjects anyway - 1.6 factor rebel xt , i'm great shape some my other lenses . if you don't happen already super wide lens your arsenal , you getting digital eos 1.6 magnification factor , then buy this lens . please don't let some other " lens snobs " sway you - few which actually " posers " snap less than 500 pix per year spend more time looking technical aspects picture instead its true artistic value . i hear them now .. " it isn't contrasty enough " , " barrel distortion horrible wide end " , " pin cushion significant " ... i say bah !! these statements true ... sure they ... degree . but let remember not everyone afford picky . buy lens , load camera fresh battery blank memory card get out there !! if you find yourself shooting wide end often , then sell/give this lens colleague go search ( higher quality ) lens ... very little lost . enjoy yourselves take lots pictures ... good luck	1
excellent flash use my canon 20d fantastic price , canon 580ex expensive option , but should i buy one future ? 430ex perfect slave unit . great product canon always	1
i mainly bought this go end lens adapter s2 . it well protect lens , but you can't put lens cap over it . it ends up easier use without lens cap ... quicker when taking pictures . pictures very good through it	1
puts protective glass over your expensive gla$$ without distortion .	1
this handy little tool must not just nikon owners , but all camera owners . genius design function , i would whole-heartedly urge every person camera buy one , or many , asap	1
i love this flash . i just recently purchased it used it 2 big events it worked perfectly . i still don't know everything it capable doing but am still able work it just fine without even reading manual . i would definitely recommend this flash .	1
i chance compare it tokina glass . canon better contrast better distortion , same or even slightly worse sharpness , complete looser build quality . if you ok 12mm - get tokina	1
excellent camera kit . versatile . i lot learn camera , though , it no simple point-and-shoot . however , auto mode , it takes great point-and-shoot pictures . i look forward learning how use it fully . lenses came warranty cards , but camera itself not . i bought sb-600 flash well battery two 1 gb compact flash cards round out kit . camera lens attached large , which i underestimated . $80 camera bag too small it all . great camera , though . price best i could find anywhere	1
i 2 rebel cameras so it just made sense me pick up this digital camera attach my old lenses . while i owned other digitals i keep going back my old rebel , until now . we got back up battery pack . my husband i love it	1
pros : - reduces flare ghosting when shooting bright light . - helps protect your lens dirt scratches . - somewhat protects lens case fall . better break hood than front element . - makes you look more like you know what you doing helps keep others carelessly walking front you . cons : - increase lens movement windy situations , kind like sail boat . - takes up more room your bag , even when reversed they still add diameter lens . - people take more notice you , help blow your cover if you trying keep low profile	1
when i bought digital camera , i already knew i would need rechargeable batteries it . what i didn't realize how quickly camera would eat supplied alkalines . i taken barely dozen pictures before they drained point where camera would no longer operate ! so i looked set rechargeable batteries charger quickly settled this one because previous experience monster cable products . it performs better than advertised . initial charge may taken 3 hours , but subsequent charges much quicker . i yet drain these batteries point where they won't operate camera . charger itself attractive unit appliance , led indicator lights up red charging changes green indicate fully charged . it compact enough fit comfortably camera bag plug folds into back it . i good service it highly recommend this charger	1
excellent case , no question it . it stylish well-put together . this not worn belt , though , it must go pocket , purse , or your hand . main thing it keeps awesome camera safe sound , it looks good doing it .	1
i've my d70s year now , haven't regretted it second . controls laid out logically , everything hand . dual control wheels make adjustments fast accurate . i personally love optional grid overlay , i no excuses horizons aren't horizontal . wireless flash system great , though you buy sb-600 or sb-800 get full benefit . this camera bigger heavier than d50 d80 , which my opinion positive thing .	1
if you looking great all around camera , this it ! our kids play sports constant motion sports mode captures it all . also love " last 4 " feature , gets some great action shots . we fuji 7000 before this they definately fixed features bugged me . love new manual zoom ( if you like 35mm lenses your like this ) well battery drain . i used replace batteries every day , now its more like once week amount we use it . my other favorite feature dual memory slots those times where i forget put it back camera after downloading ! so there always one there !. video comes out great new manual lens you zoom during video shots . general , without spending lot more , you get great camera keeps up active " picture happy " family	1
these cameras simple use any i ever seen quality pictures good or better than cameras costing 3 times much . great buy	1
compare price product i highly recommend any one who own canon eos camera ...	1
aside form fact canon charges arm leg 1 dollar piece plastic , remote switch work well . it not feel very sturdy not seem nearly well built canon cameras . people big hands may little trouble using this product . overall , " must " addition anyone interested long exposures , images excellent sharpness depth field	1
this first lens i've owned . i trouble justifying extra expense but am now quite pleased i took step up . keep mind tis ef not ef-s lens . this makes its effective focal length 45-215mm my digital rebel . i love zoom range ( great shooting action shots kids without getting their faces ) ability easily control depth field my nature shots . just uploaded some my recent shots this lens under " share your own customer images " . pete leclair http://www.agentz.com/digitalimagesbyjpl	1
i my canon eos 30d week after 500 shutter actuations i am completely addicted photography . i bought 17-85mm canon lens it takes phenomenal pics especially using software post-processing raw . i also 70-300mm lens sports/outdoors/nature bursts 5fps beautiful sound . i bought camera through dell rebates currently this best deal out there ! strongly recommend . pay extra $$$ get this over rebel xti . you won't disappointed	1
better than photo album showing off series pictures . buttons fairly intuitive , instructions understandable , there nothing like " first kid block " new toy . getting all sorts comments my picture show	1
what not like ? light , compact comes strap , case wipe cloth . they perfect . keep mind 12 power more challeging hold still	1
i love this camera first day i received it i took 3 rolls film . it best purchase i bought this year . i got real good price it i received it fast !	1
this camera perfect me i [ ... ] [ ... ] it always seems there doing something ide like catch film . this camcorder small enough some days i it my jacket pocket instant makes it really easy catch them moments usually gone time you get them big cameras out bag ready go . also it extract still picture out video clip so them candid shots never missed . settings this camera really easy understand use . it takes really good video pictures although ive not taken alot still pictures because i like extract perfect picture out video clip . this camera takes video cards so your not always downloading onto your pc . ive got few 2 gig cards so ive always one camera ready go . battery not last long time so i recommend couple extra , there pretty cheep here amazon it usually takes one battery download onto pc if you it hooked up your pc any lengh time . i dont know anything camera how they work i just like take pictures so far this easiest camera /camcorder ive seen	1
i'm former 35mm photographer who little older not spry i once i eventually got out habit lugging case equipment everywhere i went . i got re-energized photography digital but small compact point shoot left me wanting more . digital slr pricey friend pointed out i'd back lugging case equipment around me her . she recommended this model more i looked it more i liked it . it fixed lens model , but 12:1 optical zoom what other lenses would really need . it start up fast , zooms focuses internally so there no moving barrel hold . it just every feature advanced amateur could want . it macro . it optical stablization system works advertised . so far i haven't come across anything it can't . this nice unit advanced amateur or even semi-pro who doesn't want go full digital slr yet .	1
it works specified my sony hdr-hc3 hd camcorder . i used it several times cant find any noticeable blurs/distortions using this lens . its little pricey , but well worth money	1
i wasn't sure if it would worth spending money this case . how wrong i . if you're into diving one these cameras , buy it now	1
when i purchased this camera i really conflicted wheather i should get digital still camera or digital video camera . so when i decided still found out canon powershot video feature , i pleased but very low expectations . boy i suprised ! this camera so many fun features both still video pics . quality awesome both ! there video email option so you don't guess if your videos going fit into email . but if you want you create some really good quality video quick adjustment . all it transfers easily my computer . plus still pics there lots easy features choose so you quickly set up any kind shooting sinario .	1
i gave this camera 5 stars because it awesome features . this camera perfect size kids you put video this camera . i love this camera . i think it takes awesome pictures	1
it rated 5 meters but i took it 9 there no sings moisture or single drop . antifogging solution provided works more than hour . microphone records sound well . i high def cam . pack not decrease image quality inside or outside water . specs it stated its buoyancy positive , experience i recomend buy weight it avoid camera going up water while you push push down - even more snorkeling . there special weights mounted enclosure using trypod whole . i would say 14-18 onz it fine . it great item	1
very easy use . menuing extremely intuitive . don't forget order spare disks , 30 mins goes quick	1
i don't like pink so i bought blue bag . i bought black one , but it so skimpy i returned it prayed until this one arrived . i no trouble amazon crediting me return , either . it so cute ! i'm too old " cute , " but i kept it because i needed case my new hp r717 . it small , yet padded enough trust your camera cushioned if you drop it . i dropped my camera it not injured . it little pouch inside store extra battery my camera , not big aa batteries , but flat type come my r717 . i recommend this little bag , or pink one , even if you don't like pink ... or blue . they well cushioned snug , but not too snug you think they tear . sturdy nice shoulder straps magnet closures	1
i recently purchased this camera . it arrived one day before i due fly out palm springs . i took lots pictures this camera pleased all them except night time pictures . this may or may not because i am novice photographer . even night time setting my pictures came out blurry , but all others came out better than i ever expected . i think once i play around it , my night time pictures improve , but straight out box this kinda disappointing me . no regrets this purchase though . also , buy larger memory stick . one comes camera only stored 6 pictures i run out buy .	1
years now i buying " bargain " cameras foolish notion i not need nice one . finally , i got sick it bought exilim ex-z600 . this camera awesome . screen huge , picture quality great , it easy use sooo small . overall , great buy . one downside i only connect it my computer using dock . luckily , i sd card reader , so i normally just use download my pictures	1
this case well thought out snorkeling/diving using your own digital camera without going expense really expensive camera . definitely better choice than using those throw-away underwater cameras or renting one . only drawback it triples size great 720sw camera - since size one its strongpoint	1
this camera everything it says ; yes , it waterproof i very uneasy taking digital camera into water first time !! only reason i didn't give it 5 stars : it slow every other digital camera i've owned far focusing , multiple flashes , then actually shooting . you get your subject attention they smile , frozen , you hold down shutter release good 3 seconds until shot taken ( low light . ) i especially intrigued its " bright capture " technology , but it honestly doesn't seem any different low light than my old sony u20 2mp tiny little snapshot camera . still same flash-in-the-dark look . there fill-flash low light program mode ( among many many others ) , but shutter speed sets itself so slow background becomes messy worthless blob , even if you hold your breath try remain still . my ideal snapshot camera portable , durable , quick , easy , produces excellent results without think your exposure modes . this camera 3.5 out those 5 . it way portable , very durable , easy , produces ok results but you mess settings if you're not daylight , it not very quick . overall i am very happy purchase carry it everywhere	1
philips 8-inch digital picture frame excellent , high-quality device . very easy get it going - included cable computer software make it simple select digital pictures already stored your computer copy them onto device . no need mess around memory cards - although device accepts those well if works best you . everyone who seen ours loves it . it looks great picture quality size excellent	1
i bought this item present , person really liked it !!. he uses it watch deer , other animals . focus very good , i am very happy i bought this product !	1
it lasts lot shots , 1000 shots , it amazing , two these batteries you almost month holiday without any recharge	1
after buying this camera i pleased most part , interface extremely simple picture quality very good . it sleek , smooth design minimal buttons , thus little confusion . there 3 things , however , i'm not happy . one it takes double batteries , eats them up really fast . second thing there no secondary viewfinder , just lcd screen . lcd screen large , which great .. but this why battery life so low . you can't turn lcd screen off , so batteries go fast . third final thing i dislike it there no ac adaptor , so whenever you plug your camera into computer or tv , not using it take pictures , you run it batteries . , unless you somehow find compatible 3 volt ac plug , which neither vivitar website , or anywhere else online i find made specifically this camera . i'm little upset it came no adapter , would so useful camera eats up batteries . i reccomend rechargibles if you're going get this camera	1
10mp , this camera takes some clearest visually stunning pictures i ever taken digital camera . clarity detail alone reason get this camera . display , although pooh-poohed others too small , quite large me . cameras small , lithe design selling point . nothing bulky this camera . you put it your front pants-pocket if you needed . yourself favor get this camera . you won't regret it .	1
i like this small thing . work great cheap	1
canon underwater housings designed protect your camera elements , whether they sand , rain , pool , or ocean . use beach , while snorkeling , or taking shots your kids pool there little or no need worry buoyancy your camera housing . if you free dive or scuba dive you not want your camera housing floating out your hands . these weights easy way adjust buoyancy your housing . kit comes four weight plates so you fine tune your housing buoyancy . i prefer heavier setup added extra plate compared what recommended canon . i'm very happy setup they very easy use .	1
just advertised , very small , very useful , great video , great photos , just what i neededthis second jvc camera i own both satisfy my needs	1
i always say there technology you use technology you impress others . this model helps you both . you nice 5.1 mp still camera mpegmovie4tv video . very fact you camera which you take both still pictures video huge . i never video camera before because i hate carry two camera big camera case , so this obvious solution . i realize instead embracing moment ( which they need memory ) most people often juggle cameras . cons : * sometimes people might confuse it camera phone * buttons harder find * software not best * wish more zoompros : * convince * compact * battery lasts long * flash good * video sound quality goodi wonder why this model not swept market - story good product mad marketing	1
this scope one best gen 1 units market . 36 lines/mm , it just best resolution . most other units only 24 lines/mm . illuminator bright ( almost too bright ) , uniform , crisp edge . it could bit larger , however , so it would fill field view . note if you remove eyepiece or lens , ( put riflescope eyepiece or change magnification ) you break seal unit no longer waterproof . don't bother ir flashlight . it output actually less than built-in illuminator it far uniform .	1
little background first ... this upgrade camera me , just over year ago . i 35mm format over 20 years . i used pentax k1000 body several different lenses , tele-converters filters . work , i've 4 years experience fuji fine pix 2mp " point-and-shoot " . it provided my work very durable ( it , i am construction engineering ) . when i decided switch " personally " all digital i very cautious . i first looked pic quality durability . " advanced-amature " photographer point view , this camera great !!! this camera never leaves my side . it travels me everywhere i go . it extremely durable it mounted " ultra-pod ii " i carry it over my shoulder ( i don't keep it bag ) . it provides me outstanding quality pohotgraphs ( close , far or fast : work or play ) very reasonable price . it takes reasonable video ( considering my 35mm took none all ) . it easy use learn ( even old 35mm guy ) . it lightweight power usage not issue ( nimh way go ) . i take close 20,000 pics year work play . i am always experimenting this camera it limits . i am so pleased this camera ( previous fuji i used ) my next upgrade fuji well ( looking 10mp ) . $$$ you can't go wrong	1
excellent product price . pictures not good , but you can't ask more this price	1
it easy use makes good pictures , easily match disposable cameras require you turn camera wait . i also 1gb san card so i shoot up almost 1400 pictures . it i shoot couple then load them into my laptop send them people via e-mail	1
battery great it pretty nice own two these , so when one batteryis discharged i just pop spare . it stock delivered me reasonable amount time	1
this just arrived thursday so these comments come minimal time camera so far . i am also absolutely amateur user camcorders so i won't able comment quality manual controls , etc . i agree closely other two reviews so i won't repeat their details . i'll try hit few other topics also compare hc7 sony hc90 , earlier model took 16:9 standard definition video 3 mp stills . i taken one hour hd video so far , viewed it through hdmi cable sony 46 " xbr lcd tv ( 1080p ) . i captured few indoor scenes , few neighborhood outdoor scenes , some footage harper ferry west virginia - river , mountain , two trains passing close range while i railroad station there . i say comfortably you won't confuse video this camcorder standard definition camcorder video - when they say high definition , they aren't kidding . if your tv show video off advantage you've grown fond hd , i think you'd pleased this camcorder . my case , overwhelming reason i upgraded camcorders get hd video , so this made it worth steep expense . my second requirement camcorder took decent stills so i only carry one piece equipment around . i already this sony hc90 3mp , so going up 6mp desirable but not enough make me buy something this expensive itself . my only output criticisms so far west virginia footage looks little brighter water little greener than i remember . i didn't play any settings so take grain salt . these camcorders lot manual adjustments you make which i not explored . one or more them undoubtedly would given me improved footage , i'm not unhappy what i think i noticed slightes t.t he stills look very good me so far , but i've only taken 20 viewed them tv . i normally view stills pc . i don't telephoto lens yet so i can't report quality stabilization . i used tripod today readily apparent stability video . i very pleased , way , how well camera moving trains . very crisp where i expected fair bit motion blur . lcd size controls mentioned first looks . i'm perfectly happy 2.7 " lcd instead larger one ux7 . so this wasn't negative me personally . controls ( menus ) highly similar those sony hc90 i already . if you haven't seen them before , there learning curve . if you hc90 or camcorder those menus , you'll right home hc7 . one note : you configure p[ersonal]-menus include things you use most your own order , addition camcorder menus . one thing i forgot each mode ( video , camera , play/edit ) its own configurable personal menu . so i looking things add play/edit personal menu i sure should configurable , but couldn't find them . because they belonged only filming side , not playback side . so you've got three personal menus you create , not one . battery : check sizes batteries . hc90 batteries very thin . i think three batteries hc7 fit entirely within its case . fourth largest battery looked much bigger one dimension such i thought it would extend past end camera 1/2 " or so . other three fit flush into back camera , though they're not behind door or anything . battery life : my impression so far battery life statements accurate , but batteries drain faster than hc90 . this almost certainly function increased power load instead older batteries better than newer ones . ccds stills everything all " more " than hc90 . so i think i'm fine battery life , but you'll need watch it definitely more than one battery . size compared hc90 : this struck me 10-15% bigger overall than hc90 . it maybe 1/2 " longer front back , wider well . i think hc7 one notch up size average camcorder i see best buy . but it noticeably smaller than last year sr1 sony hard disk camcorder , say . i don't see dropping this one coat pocket like i hc90 , but it pretty light still fits case i used hc90 if i don't load other stuff there . fit hand : i found best buy hc5 ux5 hand played both same time . these same footprint hc7 ux7 far i tell . hc5 tape case maybe 3/8 " wider than ux5 dvd case . ux5 dvd case maybe 1/4 " higher . so i found my right-hand fingers curled nicely around smaller but taller ux5 it felt slightly more comfortable . however , i found hc5 extra width made me curl my palm slightly such base camcorder fit solidly top ball my thumb . i played this store , i realized it seemed like hc5 actually easier hold stable because this . absolutely try these two out your own instead assuming this true you . just wanted say two cases differ bit probably feel different you some level . tape vs dvd ( really hdv vs avchd ): i spent lot time wondering if noise reported last year avchd ux camcorders would still present , if i would care any case . detailed reviews still aren't out , so i don't know whether there noise problem there . but i say i noticed nothing footage so far i'd call noise , so my decision go tape hdv format looks very good me right now . i never problems people report mini-dv tapes , so whole transport discussion ( tape vs dvd ) didn't weigh me much . noise discussion effect my decision , though . getting video your tv : " how much money we ? " , apparently . i played tape back tv directly , but that not long-term solution . i heard you capture hdv video then able transform it pc formats suitable blu-ray or hdv burners , if you money . then you need blu-ray or hdv player attached your tv . now , it sounds like many people archiving hdv video dvds data files . then they burn playable dvds where hd down-converted standard definition video . so they get see decent versions video now produce hd versions playback future technology changes prices drop . one other hc7 reviewer also implied hd files captured ulead software could moved ps3 hard drive played back hd tv there . so far , easy cheap path we sd video dvds tvs not quite there hd based what i've read . one extra feature i wish camcorder built-in 20x optical zoom . i'm sure this would affect both cost size barrel negatively , so i " understand " . but would #1 my wish list . overall , i am amazed what camcorder manufacturers pack into these shells now . i know we're talking computers way more powerful image processing than anything existed ten years ago . but it still almost like magic drag camcorder this size around , take some video , then play it back high-quality hd tv looking me like it taken broadcast-level equipment . i know better intellectually , but it really great camcorder like this marries up new tvs so beautifully .	1
after owning using camera month or so now , i am delighted it . i only replaced batteries one time , so don't know what review hullabuloo . small lightweight , many features . choice 6 meg , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 meg photos fingertips . what i really decided this camera macro capability i take photos very small coins , must able get within inch or two . it preforms magnificantly . my previous camera add additional lens this which hassle . i love samsung digimax s600 .	1

this digital photo frame reasonably good picture quality once set up , used anyone selected mode . i it set slide presentation mode people enjoy looking it . i could easily see giving it , already set up , people who not computer savvy , such grandparents . give them new pictures , send new card they slip . said , cost still fairly high buttons top frame useless unless you them memorized or really good vision . i would recommend this product	1

i used some third party batteries 15 minute charger , used die 10 photoes or so . this canon one seems realllly laaast looong ...	1
we purchased this camera replacement our bulky sony dsc-p52 , which stopped working after year or so due problem lens mechanism . naturally , only time tell if this any different , but meantime , here what you need know this baby : good : 1 ) size weight - fits almost comfortably any pocket . much thinner lighter than any previous digital camera i've owned , thus encourages one carry it most anywhere . size also pretty comfortable one-hand shooting . 2 ) big lcd screen - you didn't need me tell you this , right ? makes previewing images taking shots much more satisfying , though sometimes it not appear very clear , especially if subject not static . however , it bright rich color . 3 ) infolithium - this sony name battery tells you how much time it left - only approximately , course . if use consistent , provide you good idea . if you use one function then then , it tends vary much more not useful . 4 ) integrated charger/usb station - flimsy plastic cradle takes care charging on-board battery well providing usb hookup downloading images video into computer . minimizes wires removes need separate charger , though bright white color far match . bad : 1 ) focusing problems - camera cannot focus objects relatively close it . i am not speaking macros , but simply function - or lack thereof - focus small , near objects , such coins , stamps , or text . quick focus objects farther away , though . 2 ) integrated battery - i listed infolithium positive , but fact you cannot just pop-in couple aa batteries means you always need station or plug charge up if you need some juice . i don't know if battery universal , but even if it , it cost substantially more purchase replacement . 3 ) incompatible memory sticks - i not complain sony desire make consumers pay more its cards than adopting standard , but this camera uses memorystick duo , which 1/4 or so smaller than " regular " memorystick . this means hundreds you may invested memory cards previous sony digital cameras pretty useless , they not fit into this or any other device using smaller cards . 4 ) ineffective flash - flash tiny , thus not provide adequate illumination dark . within few feet okay , but farther subjects not touched . 5 ) 3x optical zoom - c'mon , this 2005 ! 3x optical zoom pretty pathetic such expensive camera . 6 ) slow write speed - there decent pause pictures , meaning you not able shoot rapid rate . you certainly take pictures bursts , but it takes even longer write memory stick . previewing images also slow . this also disappointing , it not faster than my older 52.7 ) no tripod hookup - if you wish use tripod , you mount camera plastic station , then connect tripod plastic dock . this far ideal . well , there you it . negatives i listed may insignificant you , which case this could great value you . i am certainly happy it , but i only wish sony would stop treating its customers like cash cows changing standards , compatibilities , dubious long-term quality	1
very compact , light easy hold - full marks design . buttons etc take bit getting used , but ok once mastered . main downside me it only takes dvd-r/rw- not dvd-r/rw+ , bit problem when you pick up wrong ones ! also , problem taking it abroad - i issues charging it it would take standard us uk converter plug pins slightly wider than normal us plugs .	1
case beautiful leather . seems sturdy well made . would more functional if belt holder open ended , i thought . i ordered it my son , but found it very feminine when it arrived . i give it someone else	1
i bought this camera replace 3mp kodak cx series when i thought i lost it . my 3mp took great pics i never any problems it i didn't want learn use different brands software . kodak easyshare software didn't impress me much when i bought first camera but they made some improvements updated version much better . kodak gallery nice option allows you share pics without sending large email files . i haven't used c533 lot since i bought it but pics i've taken come out great . but just like other reviews state , slow shutter speed low light it like batteries . however , if you spend extra money lithium batteries you'll get much improved battery life . all all great value perfect camera point shoot person	1
i purchased this camera replacement canon optura 20 which dropped when estimate repair exceeded price this camera , i decided move . after using dcr-hc28 several weeks , i believe this very neat package . overall , i am very satisfied this camera . one first things i noticed color representation low light conditions much more accurate than canon . i grew accustomed adjusting optura white balance indoor order get accurate color tones . now i am finding , automatic settings work just fine , fact , i didn't reason play presets yet . this camera more " point shoot " type than canon . it provides you manual controls , but they not easily accessible . still , i not found reason mess these . besides , those , who would claim manual settings necessary advanced/professional type filming , i would point price tag ask where when they last see advanced/professional camera under $300 ? this camera also half size canon combined low price weight , produces package i drag me while going beach , bicycling , hiking , etc not worry ruining expensive piece electronic gear , case my optura which , time when i bought it , cost me 2.5 times what i paid sony . so far , i've used this camera all lighting conditions i would expect ever consider . i no complaints its performance . picture seems sharply focused color tones correct . focus fast enough keep up little kids or shoot some sports/action . sound quality microphone quiet acceptable . there seems very little noise drive motor it not picked up mic so it not transferred your recording . all essential controls menus within easy reach . there few negative points prevent me giving this camera 5-star rating . lack any kind accessory shoe or external microphone input drawback . it would nice these , it would increase range conditions under which one use it . still , among my friends , who actually camcorder , 90% don't own accessory light or external microphone , so if it possible lower camera cost omitting these features , it not criminal move part sony . lcd display could bit larger it would not hurt if sony would provide it more freedom motion - it only swings out 90 degree angle certain situations it limiting factor .	1

my fuji e900 fits perfectly also battery charger extra batteries . front pocket additional memory cards great idea . case goes belt or neck strap accomodate personal taste . very nice reasonably priced	1
this my first digital camera . prior this i simple kodak point-and-click model which pretty much quality disposible . i use much higher grade cameras work both 35mm digital . this camera gives you 5.1 mp ability though most shots only require 3mp . i like 32mb internal memory though i've also bought 256mb card traveling . 5x zoom isn't cool i initially thought it would digital zoom works sometimes not others but you must understand what digital zoom really . camera takes very clear optimal pictures . better pictures then i've taken anything else i've owned before ( some work cameras well ) . size small enough put your pocket but not too small one larger hands . different flash options shooting scenes turn difficult pictures into what you want capture . panoramic shot sequence especially favorite feature especially shoreline shots . i've also bought r-series dock enjoy its ability transfer my pictures faster charge two batteries once . this camera worth price you pay but i believe its 2005 model so it may not most up date but it great job .	1
it exactly same thing came my camera- just what i neede	1
i searching web site after web site system like this . i finally found site where i could purchase seperate parts comparable system . however , receivers alone more than this unit ( if you wanted receiver compatible plasma ) . this works great . could not easier install . all components my basement . i ran eye through wall eye barely exposed through single cable face plate , blue led light taped back plate . blue light still shines through faceplate , which perfect . faceplate just below my wall mounted plasma set . no interference . this set up allows me use this system just any angle room adjacent kitchen . works great basic $20 all one ir remote . also , customer service like no other . i several questions each e-mail answered next day great help . made this purchase no brainer . this one product far exceeded my expectations even after reading all great reviews . i highly recomend this product .	1
gs150 performance as-advertised . terrific colour rendering , thanks its 3-chip configuration . camera also option full manual control standard settings , making it even more usable . love joystick ! still find it hard believe panasonic managed fit all this performance into such small package . final score : engineering 1 , customer service 0early production runs this camera seem shielding problem , which causes faint , red , horizontal bands appear when recording very low light conditions . despite fact this widely ( if unofficially ) reported gs150 owners around world , these same owners noted panasonic customer service generally denies problem exists . thankfully , problem easily repaired certified technician . better still , gs150 owners seem collectively deciphered units manufactured september 2005 onward alright . look cameras serial numbers beginning ' h5 ' or higher . you also read all this pana3ccduser dot com	1

this neat idea . you close up pictures really able see them small screen . it very easy load pictures it very handy me show others our most recent pictures	1
solid construction , good optics , nice sound . mentioned others , output usb transfer found handycam console not camera itself ... minor annoyance . all all , this good camera touch pricy but you get what you pay ....	1

i mainly use camcorder recording my kids . i bought this camcorder couple weeks ago . i sony hc-7 before couple weeks which i returned buy canon camcorder . high light performance both camcorders excellent . sony camcorder , i felt best color performance achieved reducing color intensity . low light performance when recording 1080i similar two camcorders but much better canon when recording 24p format . this main reason i prefer canon . 24p recording more sensitive motion which problem if recording motion . still images canon lower resolution but me they looked better than sony . this especially true when taking flash pictures . sony seems little better built . hdmi cover canon poorly built . i liked controls canon better than sony . auto focus automatic white balance worked better canon than sony . auto white balance sony worked poorly indoor light . sony supershot infrared recording canon not . sony more manual controls than canon .

this review coolpix 5900 5mp . you not displeased this camera if you market compact digital camera . this little baby lies comfortably your pocket until you want it rarely fails deliver , no matter what lighting obstacles you throw it path . footprint amazingly small 5mp you'll amazed functionality . i found video/movie feature real useful tool surprises most people great clarity utterly blown-away night shots poor light . think las vegas lights strip , or crowd people thin night light . this camera handled it all . sd card easy access , i recommend 1gb size so you take your time movies . otherwise 512mb card give you 300 photos . but i warn you , you bitten movie bug want use this more more ( provided you disk space or burn excess dvds ) . i also recommend san disk ultra ii sd cards fast recovery speeds , so you don't wait each shot record before going next shot ( this 5 mp that lot pixals store ) . roll side body enables you keep tight grip it one hand shots- feature many small cameras lacked . battery life exceptional , but always , buy backup travel . hit one star frustratingly small on/off button . i know they designed it so it won't accidentally turn your pocket , but my fat finger not best tool .... 2 inch lcd not protected like others too , but so far seems pretty tough , rolling around my pocket sunglasses other things so far not scratched it .	1
this nice bag , but don't buy it canon s2 it not fit . product compatibility lists s1 since s2 s1 very similar i purchased this bag . i can't even get thing bag . it nice bag however put my smaller kodak camera it . there plenty room typical point shoot camera all it accessories . good quality	1
this my second digital camera . although it so much more than my first , it much easier operate . i especially love fact i video my grandson baseball game , then convert individule frames photos ( jpeg ) great quality . i series photos him getting hit . it looks great ! thanks great product . ralp	1
photos printed very sharp . some difficulty printer cartidge expensive they , you can't afford much difficulty . good craft times kids	1
not expect this replace zoom your camera . it not nor it intended so . what it optically bring things little bit closer . this certainly preferably using digital zoom comes so many cameras . lens works screwing into end camera lens where filters would normally put . this means it something which must planned used . it not put while filming taking place ; it place when filming begins . since it easy use , this should not take too long . normal zoom camera used while this lens place . it place just changes limits little bit closer what would normally case not quite far when camera zoomed out maximum . care should taken not get this lens cross threaded when putting it place . quality optics seem fine . i used it sony dcr-vx2100 no problems . this handy gadget handy your case but aware what it not .	1
this very flexible capable camera . if you looking more than point shoot offer , there very few would compare . me deciding factor high quality lieca lens wide angle , if you havent compared this directly conventianal lens you amazed what youve missing . 16:9 ok feature if you plan hdtv veiwing but screen size compromised when you switch 4:3 . i would prefer larger screen lose 16:9 feature . lens cap little annoying well but those issues aside , i am very satisfied	1
bought these binoculars my husband . he loves them . they very powerful he loves way they feel - not too heavy . he look stuff across creek amazed clarity things he sees	1
i am extremely happy this purchase ! i love 10x zoom when taking pics my kids	1
if you use viewfinder instead lcd field , it not appear lcd , you only see it through viewfinder . this different previous models . minor annoyance . quality videos surprisingly good , but it saves them quicktime . mov format . mov not my favorite format , but perhaps others not bothered this . although i heard color kodaks not natural , i found it excellent . overall quality pictures good . price , i think this very good value adequate most casual photographers .	1
i looking expand my lens collection without breaking my budget found this 50mm excellent first choice . i love able shoot low light situations which this lens allowed me . however , auto-focus leave lot desired far speed accuracy goes . i've found leaving it manual focus allows me get more shots faster , least low light .	1
i no complaints . i this camera over year half it reliable , fast , gives me crisp , quality photos ! only option i wish this camera better stabilization mode prevent blurred pictures , but software edits blur without reducing quality . blurry pictures not problem long you know how aim shoot . everyone loves playing my camera because it many cool features make your photos fun ! i highly recommend this camera ( especially beginners or those who just want simple camera capture those precious moments , high quality photos ) . excellent camera overall ! ;	1
we love this camera . it small , easy use , big lcd screen takes great pictures . fuji always great product this one no exception	1
love this digital camera compared our previous ones . we're mostly point-and-click family , this easy-to-use camera good point-and-click gives opportunity more if you should so choose some day	1
this must item your kodak dig . camera . it allows filters , tele/wide aux lenses or any 55mm screw attachment . apart black metal enclosure compleatly covers entire lens assemby , any zoom or focal length . this adds very strong valuable protection your lens . if you accidentally bang camera against hard surface this adapter may very likely save your lens ( camera ) destruction . i always keep it skylight filter , skylight or uv filter further protects lens impact , scratches dust . if used when lens not fully extended ex : wide angle normal zoom , adpter also helps block out stray light acts light shade . kodak aught this built into their camera permanent fixture , but alas they make extra revenue their accessories . buy it !	1
purchased gift well received . seems handle larger chips timely manner . runs everyday , all day no problems encountered . displays vacation pictures clearly . like it big enough view across room . frame more compatible decore than 7 " model previously purchased	1
battery perfect once camera , indistinguishable original .	1
controls this camera not hard figure out . it fun haveall little things you pictures 12 almost 13 , photogerphy somthing i love this camera . if you think thiscamera complicated , well you didnt read instruction guide very well	1
i am pleased purchase . very good value . picture quality good it easy operate . only negative it advertised wood frame when fact it plastic . however , it looks good . this my second purchase this product : one myself one gift	1
one reviews i read before purchasing these suggested reviewer should've them her celine dion concert . i took suggestion they perfect ! they fit nicely my evening bag brought celine closer me i sat second mezzanine caesar palace ! not only - but price right ! i couldn't happier ! plus , now i them our next trip rocky mountain park get up close personal some wildlife	1
this item cute . my only complaint it really only hold camera . there no space extra card or battery . it however convenient belt clip back you could also attach shoulder strap .	1
i get bandwagon here . this superb little camera , definately five stars ! i also tz1 , which showed promise , but limitations . my review tz1 , i noted it lots " noise " pictures shouldn't printed much beyond 4x6 inches if they sharp . i also wanted more manual controls . tz3 fixes improves almost everything tz1 adds some new , very useful features . noise drastically reduced , lens better , sensor bigger , processor not only faster , but produces better pictures . tz3 adds very handy " function " button - or i should say function capability - number buttons same - which gives immediate access five or so " most used " settings without go into menues - which there several . tz3 keeps mega optical image stabilization adds intelligent iso , increases sensitivity without adding noise , ( i not tried 3200 setting yet . ) , increases size viewing screen , etc ., etc . tz3 " well-rounded , " very capable camera . there simply no comparison tz1 tz3 far quality pictures . tz3 wins hands down . my opinion it also beats some big name , higher priced digicams - couple which i own - rather handily . course , big selling point tz3 still 10x lens - now wide angle capability - pocket-sized point shoot camera . this lens sharp , combined larger sensor new processor yields some excellent results . while there no manual controls , per se , camera seems very well without them . pictures sharp , exposures seem nicely ( haven't tried it night yet , but low light forrest shots excellent ) , colors accurate , appropriately saturated , vivid ( ok . i like vivid setting . ) , good contrast , etc . there variety af settings , settable focal points , focus modes . there also exposure compensation , exposure bracketing available - they work well ! live histogram welcome bonus . tz3 focuses down 2 inches macro mode - again excellent , sharp results . tz3 very well speced out . one nice thing gone lens cap tz1 . it really not inconvenient , but seemed always swinging wind add yet source camera shake . tz3 lens includes built lens cover . very welcome . i currently own five top flight digicams ( including this one ) , owned many others , i am most impressed this one - combined convenience results . it quantum step forward . i also couple quite nice , fairly complete dslr kits . they wonderful , class themselves , but when i want very nice pictures convenience pocketable point shoot 10x , wide angle lens , or back up dslrs , tz3 now my camera choice .	1
i used camera three months , absolutely love it ! pictures crisp ( even very close-ups ) , video feature right up there . sound pick-up excellent . i created two dvd combining videos still pictures . folks thought quality very good . battery life rated very good , i found this true . i carry camera me nearly everywhere i go . people impressed size . drawbacks ? because its size , there no connections camera computer , tv or battery charger . docking station small lightweight . because battery life , i never away home long enough need recharging . i recommend camera without reservations , look first casio future	1
this great , easy use camera . i this camera year it seen alot use . only drawback i this camera it eats aa batteries . i bought rechargeable aa they seem last forever ! problem solved . i am purchase second one my son christmas . great camera	1
this enough instrument show you new things sky years come . it sturdy simple operate . it enough light-gathering power ( more important than magnification ) reveal dim star clusters , nebulae , galaxies good enough optics show you surface planets like jupiter , saturn , mars . some advice selection . dobsonians like this one come range sizes . 114mm ( 4 � " ) bit small side but still fine instrument , especially if your ability carry large objects limited . 150-200mm ( 6-8 " ) scope right middle recommended range . 250mm ( 10 " ) like this one big side , you should buy one only if you able-bodied . some advice use . viewing through telescope less like playing cd more like playing guitar . finding objects takes little bit practice . 9x50mm " crosshair " finder supplied this scope great fine searching , but i recommend supplementing it red-dot finder aid initial pointing . you also need buy atlas ( sky telescope pocket sky atlas best available ) , red flashlight view charts without blowing out your badly-needed night vision , guidebook lead you interesting objects . these investments greatly add your enjoyment . what more i say ? this kind scope experienced observers trying steer novices towards decades . although , i recommend you your homework before buying any scope -- learn sky get know experienced stargazers who advise you -- when it comes time purchase , you could hardly better than this scope . more advice , see my encyclopedic guide here amazon , " so you want buy telescope .	1
high iso large screen reasons my purchase . screen great but , when you force iso 1600 , it seems darken pictures more than 800 . i s5200 one seems adjust other options like white balance much better when iso set w/o go full manual option . definitely something improve ! auto option seems work much better i surprised how good high speed three frame shooting works . also , two picture function(it takes two slightly different sets automatically ) saves me lot ' re-posing	1
this camcorder digital age . tiny , multi-functional , flexible . no ancien t-t echnology magnetic tape . any product leading edge , there many shortcomings . let dispense obvious . this device all compact go-anywhere flexibility ease . best image quality , dedicated mini-dv camcorder dedicated digital still camera only way go . fact , buying separate camcorder still camera may likely less expensive than sanyo c6 while resulting superior quality . overall image quality best described " ok " . poor lens zoom aperture more befitting $100 digital camera than $400 device . flash weak not light many scenes any other still camera would light . addition , since flash not offset any way lens , red-eye virtually guaranteed any range . this not problem digital touch-up common practice , but plan touching up more often . low light conditions drag down image quality dramatically video mode . virtually any digital camcorder any price outperform this sanyo video mode any situation , but little day light goes long way towards improving video quality xacti c6 . also , clear , video quality still superior anything seen best analog camcorders . all these negatives , convenience truly revolutionary . one wear tiny vpc-c6 around neck all day . this causes amazing change attitude towards video . since sanyo so compact , no one would think twice bringing it any minor travel . freed chore " packing up " camcorder means corresponding willingness bring sanyo so many more occasions , such visit park instead just weddings birthday parties . whereas mini-dv camcorder requires one hour transfer one hour worth video your computer , sanyo transfers video fast sd card usb 2.0 interface allow . means five minutes or less transfer one hour worth video computer . this ease increases willingess create video share video . no more procrastination over dragging out camcorder wiring manual task initiating video transfer computer . sanyo , just place camera docking station pictures video files available just like files usb flash drive . it difficult overestate significance this convenience . video becomes everyday pleasure , if one so wishes , rather than special occasion chore . if one values this convenience over absolute image quality , this product own . this leading edge product . get most this product , i highly recommend doing following : 1 ) sanyo provided updated firmware their website . this fixes fatal flaw audio processing some people noted excessive distortion - this update makes audio quality competitive other camcorders . addition , this firmware update adds compatability 4gb sd cards ( limit 2gb without update ) . kudos sanyo continuing support . ( note instructions littled distorted translation - what they meant write you need push set button left enter firmware update screen . ) 2 ) video mp4 format playable only quicktime . windows users , this limits video editing included programs or quicktime-specific programs . there easy solution . first , download divx codec ( freeware commercial product ) or xvid codec ( free open source product - my preference ) or ffdshow ( free open source product ) - use your search engine choice find these . second , download utility called " mp4cam2avi " ( free open source software found easily your search engine choice ) . these two programs , video becomes compatable any windows program , including just any media player ( such windows media player ) any video editing tool ( such windows movie maker ) . i look forward seeing how this market segment evolves . freedom bulk digital tedium addicting i am sure image quality continue improve . now , i am happy capturing memories would otherwise lost i continued own conventional bulky tape-based camcorder	1
i bought this camera take pictures my sons playing basketball . my other camera shot dark grainy pictures indoor . i lot success this really nice outdoor shots well . what i just started playing , i love video feature . it so easy use images better than i expected . i bought this camera december present myself i used it constantly recharged battery twice . this major me my nikon devouring batteries afternoon . optical zoom clean , but digital definitely noisy . i fun shooting pictures my kids because shutter speed so quick i don't miss shot .	1
excellent ! they really long life perfect backup your rechargeables	1
ergonomics : perfect . d200 not completely rubber-encased . there rubber where your hands need hold it , plastic where your hands rarely touch it . hand grip comfortable nicely concave where tips your fingers dig . battery door memory card door made plastic , hinge-pinned . simple slide latch opens battery door .... some warned latch could easily ( accidentally ) tripped . memory card door latch , however , uses more secure 45 degree pivoting latch . usb 2 video out/dc-in doors made flexible rubber , these doors extend into body camera hinges themselves . english language operating manual work art . each operating concept alpha ' numerically numbered pictoral diagram , page where function explained perfect english . reader quickly catch how this well thought out manual organized . i like depth field preview , mirror lock-up , multiple-exposure capability . continuous servo autofocus better job than any human following focusing any moving object . if you old manual-focus , film-based nikon slr lenses ' 70 ' 80 , except few rare exceptions , fit d200 . all these positive attributes remind me best , most highly-evolved film camera slr . no wonder so many photographers won over digital media .	1
picture fine this price . i bought panasonic vdr-d100 my daughter because she usually doesn't want anything computer like edit video . when we gave it her first thing she asked , " i edit movies ? " i quick test make sure dvds would finalize work dvd player success 3 computers 3 dvd players . i didn't find anything disc wouldn't play . then i started up vegas movie studio platinum which i use edit my minidv movies . i selected import dvd it went straight minidvd loaded files where i able edit add titles , music , sound effects voice over if i wanted . since i already bought dvd-r/w discs she able reuse them if she ever edits movies because you unfinalize discs reformat them .	1
bushnell perma focus 7x50 wide angle binoculars ideal choice my recent trip tanzania serengeti . they worked perfectly application needed . really happy surprise just how well these worked . we bounced around dirt roads cross country land rovers , perma focus feature outstanding made things simple easy ! :-) magnification level perfect almost every scenario we came across . anything outside 80 feet came through crystal clear vivid color clarity . it really made up close personal viewing all animals we saw . far , these best investment i made before trip ! i can't imagine without them now such expedition . really fantastic performance great value boot !!!! vendor fast flawless transaction too . my opinion you won't disappointed these binoculars . troy :-)	1
i little skeptical this product because cheap price lack reviews . but it just what it says it , i am really happy my purchase . i would definitely buy this again	1
overall its fine viewer however it couple problems . #1 ) it would really nice if there way copy pictures off sd card into memory vice versa . this would invaluable moving pictures around without hook things up computer . #2 ) hooking it up computer pain , instructions not helpful . if you using viewer look images off sd cards remote places ( ie trailcamera ) it works fine , but i'd like ability move pictures off card into viewers internal memory so i leave card trailcamera . #3 this nasty , if you cycle through pictures too fast you " crash " viewer . upon resetting it , it say there no pictures found memory card . powering off , swapping cards wont help it read . pictures still there however but you need then access card directly through computer extract . reformat card it fine reader . what i use it i like it even though it quirks must worked around .	1
i bought this camera my 16 year old granddaughter she just loves it . pics bright clear camera very easy handle	1
i made decision buy this camera based many very positive user reviews . it replaces six year old 2.1 megapixel camera . i am not disappointed . amazon price very good 7.1 megapixel camera boatload features . it also considerably lighter weight than older camera . later i read reviews experts who give it only mediocre scores picture quality . they criticize it no image stabilization leading blur ( especially higher power zoom ) " noise " film speeds over 100 asa . i set up couple situations which both problems should very apparent . then i enlarged smaller portions frames print inexpensive 4 6 test photos . i printed full frame , print would larger than 8 10 . i just not see problems experts criticize . colors rich vibrant . i really appreciate wide range controls . user choose number modes fitted various situations . these result faster shutter speed , or more depth field , or fill-in flash , etc . it not necessary memorize tiny icons selector dial . on-screen prompt tells you what each mode . i also like amount control manual mode . user choose asa rating , shutter speed , apeture opening , electronic flash mode . manual tells how set camera special situations , like photographing documents . when you take picture , through lens screen goes black part second . you know picture taken , unlike camera optical finder . camera very intuitive first time use . i also read most manual on-line while waiting delivery handled camera several times local discount store . when i first installed software i restarted computer , but it repeatedly would not recognize camera . i switched usb cord it worked fine immediately . then it also began work original usb cord . i even checked loose connection . who knows what ! one little thing keep mind this . if camera set continuous auto focus , you aim shoot . if it set one-time auto focus , you must press shutter halfway down wait green light before shooting , if you want sharp pictures . i not know , but expect difference battery life . 1 gb memory card store 485 pictures 7.1 megapixel resolution	1
i've using sigma 10-20mm twice or three times month i am very pleased . such wide angle , you most like need " de-fish " your final shot which remedied cs2 or some other image processing software . 10-20mm , range almost too wide , but after further usage , i got used it . i'm very accustomed 12-24mm range 10-20mm took lot getting used . only drawbacks i know using this lens it really prone flare ( despite marketing sigma stating new lens coating diminishes flare ) biggest aperture f/4 which variable pending focal length . it not fixed aperture lens . i also find this lens it sharpest around f/8-f/11 i wouldn't go beyond because i started noticing degrading image quality very small apertures this lens . but other than , i've pretty satisfied price i paid this ultra wide angle lens . i still would prefer nikon 12-24mm , but i'm not willing shell out much money wide angle lens . sigma price their 10-20mm acceptable	1
i using this scope beach night monitor sea turtle nesting . when up close , image excellent , but not so good far away ( more than 100-200 ft ) . very easy use , fact it waterproof plus ( haven't dropped it ocean yet ! ) . you can't really get feel how good image residential area , but out beach , moonlight , it rocks . most time i don't even need ir illuminator . save power , turn it off , it still provide image available light almost 5 minutes . if you're looking see things far away , this scope won't work well , but things close ( say , one end backyard other ) it good deal . i put mine hard sided padded carrying case , since it gets bounced around atv , haven't problem yet	1

takes great pics 3 " screen really nice . wall plug recharger nice also . i taken pics outside sunny , overcast , rainy conditions . indoors sporting events around house . all settings pics truly wonderful . few instances blurriness caused unsteady hand but otherwise very nice pics . however , canon top line powershot commanding higher dollar price this camera really should higher optical zoom . 3x isnt enough when other , cheaper cameras 6x optical zoom . also image stabilzation should included	1
while not ' highest end ' tripod purchases , this one must anyone owning hdr-hc1 or other compatable camcorder . operating camera tripod ( rather than touch screen ) provides steady footage amatuer videographer . unit assembles easily stable panning rotation . only drawback soft storage bag which doesn't provide adequate head protection	1
i haven't used it much but few photos i taken excellent . i'm not photography expert so i'll leave technicalities others . telephoto capability increased noticeably but not huge amount . high quality this lens , wide-angle , obvious . comes caps storage bag	1
i purchased nikon l5 costco 2 weeks ago but returned it saturday after i saw lz-7 . lz-7 way better all aspects than nikon l5 , save adjustable zoom movie mode . pros : takes great pictures ; optical image stabilization ; 6x zoom ; , great price . it also made japan , not china nikon l5 . cons : fixed zoom while movie mode ; no on-board camera speakers	1
seller super fast , product well packaged described . thank you	1
-this camara picture quality nice , depend user purpose . my gf kinda satify it . -function easy use . -battery life so so . -battery charger design not convenience . you put battery into batter charger . recommand get cradle charger , but extra cost . it should sell cradle charger .	1
when i first opened up " super quick charger " i bit put off ... it small , it cheap looking ... compared old nicd charger i used it very unimpressive . then i plugged it . say what you this barebones solution , it works amazingly well . it charges batteries quickly batteries last really long time charges . it exactly what i looking . if i could improve anything it would implement some sort cover battery slots . while it not essential process any means , it would look lot better , batteries would less prone jostled out their positions mid-charge curious cat .	1
i used product victoris falls very pleased . this time i not gone under water it .	1
i'm like most people digital camera . i take bazillion pictures , develop 10% onto paper , then banish other 90% computer storage archives . i mean , i'd love display lot more those pictures my computer , but who wall space or time organize all those prints ? that why i decided get digital picture frame . i looking quite some time , but always turned off small-ish lcd sizes or poor resolutions . then i came across this coby 10 " widescreen unit , 800x480 pixel display ! there no reviews amazon ( time ) , but spec-wise it what i wanted ; larger display higher resolution . i took chance ordered one am i glad i ! display huge , pictures look crisp . colors pretty accurate when compared my calibrated lcd computer monitor . interchangeable frames ( it comes black one well white one ) make it easy match your d�cor . litte remote easy use , but easy lose well , so make sure you place it somewhere easy find . built-in mp3 player nice touch . speakers aren't great ( it picture frame after all ) , but it nice frame play music while slideshow mode . there variety transition effects choose . i haven't tried playing videos it , so i can't comment feature . said , there few things prevent me giving this 5 stars . 1 . adjustable stand made cheap feeling plastic . i've seen other frames much nicer backs . yes , i know it front you looking , but stand should sturdier , my opinion . 2 . angle stand , while adjustable , simply held place friction . it actually one setting it click into , but then it angled too much view normal position . 3 . there seems software bug causes display act weird slideshow mode . well , more precise , if you slideshow mode you choose either fade , mask , or cross comb transition effects , then very top horizontal pixel line starts show black sections . it looks like dead pixels , but once you exit slideshow ( or use other effects other than then ones i listed ) everything fine . i recreated this problem , but i don't know if it just my frame or all these . no biggie . i now use no transition effects it perfect . 4 . this not really complaint product but more coby specs . their website they state lcd 800x480 . great ! so i ordered frame then resized whole bunch pictures resolution . however , when i got frame started using it , i noticed all my pictures black ( blank ) bars both left right sides picture . it turns out resolution actually 860x480 ( which i found out after some trial-and-error ) . it would nice know this ahead time save me re-resize my pictures . plus , sizing pictures 860x480 really weird ratio ... kinda like getting 4x7 prints . i ordered this total electronics ( one amazon vendors ) it arrived quickly . when i reported " dead pixel " problem ( which turned out software bug , not defect , so speak ) , they responded my email quickly offered take it back no questions asked . now that customer service ! overall , i am very pleased this product . reality , it rates 4.5 stars . i'm type person agonizes over something before finally buying it . this purchase , totally unncessary !	1
camcorder compact power adapter workedvery well . i given great help finding theright one my canon camcorder , which itselfwas amazing . 5 stars product helperswho helped me locate right one	1
i bought this camera six months ago my 12 year old daughter . it her ( ours ) first digital camera . i read so many reviews prior selecting this model . reviews this camera so helpful . this camera so easy use it takes excellent pictures . rechargeable batteries definitely must ! this camera best camera this price , no doubt it . we taken still shots videos . it so fun option take video . we some great clips . all i say we so happy camera . we would definitely choose it again	1
this fugifilm padded soft case strong , durable very attractive . it more than i expected . it very professional looking	1
i purchase this lens digital rebel xt body i also purchased through amazon . so far lens performed expected . it solid well built . sticks slightly , when zooming through 200mm . images crisp focus sharp . working 300mm challenge without using mono or tripod . shooting bird flight 300mm trick . overall , good lens $200 . if you more money , then lens image stabilization ( ) would way go .	1
my sony fx1 great low light capability , 3 lux , but eventually you need extra light . using your software lighten dark shots likely reveal some degree graininess , no matter which camera you use . i'm so glad i bought it . used it my birthday party . though overhead light good , dark corners room require more light . if you consider yourself advanced , semi-pro , or pro videographer , you must light . my only major beef it runs either 10 or 20 watts . no variable 5 , or 15 . it worth getting long life battery like np-970 . independent power source ( battery ) plus . but no outlet plug adaptor i know	1
novice astronomer i really enjoy sharp , steady view these binoculars . view fairly steady even i.s. off - depending how stable you course . my binoculars cost more than my telescope !! my telescope decent one too . but i think they worth it . you see so much more night sky than what naked eye see - far . they course great during day too . their weight not much issue me , although each person different depending their viewing habits . i think hard carry case would best but it not big deal my use . i recommend this pair binoculars anyone who serious great quality performance	1
this lens fairly inexpensive reason while it definitely lets you get really close image definitely larger than without it , fact fz7 fz30 macro settings already so good image perhaps 15% or so bigger than without it . if i i'll post couple flower images permit comparison without lens . camera i fz7 . because i want large image possible my focus i am very happy	1
this case great quick day outings . it rugged keeps camera safe . my wife throw it her purse i don't worry it getting banged up she doesn't worry it too bulky . everyone should two batteries any canon cameras since their battery meter only shows up minutes before it goes dead .	1
i needed tele lens complement my d50 purchase . didn't want spend too much money it but i needed one least matched my lumix fz10 sharpness . this certainly vr really works , i am able take sharp pictures up 1/40 . my d50 flies it	1
this nice lightweight tripod sony . stable well built . i used it both still video cameras without any problems . it would nice if it came travel bag some sort	1
easy learn , takes very good photos well-lighted areas but you need use flash dimmer environments - its low-light capabilities aren't great . very fast readiness time moment you switch camera - bit slow recharge flash , though , there bit lag when you press shutter button when photo actually taken ( not so great fast action shots , even though it touts " sports " mode ) . it good beginner camera , good pocket-style camera , but certainly not mistaken high-end unit .	1
i really enjoy my photosmart r725 . it small , easy portable , takes wonderful photos , very versatile terms settings . i just one thing i don't like it , that fact there no viewfinder . there lcd screen back which acts viewfinder , but it hard see bright sunlight , i'm afraid it eventually become scratched beyond use . now , it great but i'm not sure how it hold up long run . same time , it not spendy , so it might worth it	1
i love this camera ! i shake when i take pictures this easter every picture i took came out perfectly ! there so many options this camera i am fun just playing it see what all it ! i would recomend this camera anyone who looking high quality camera good price	1
great seller ! shipping very fast ! this battery out oem one came camera ... very happy ! thank	1
this flash perfect back-up studio , or main/flash fill amateur studio . i use several w/slaves lines images rival set-ups cost thousands dollars . i like they light easy pack transport . they reasonably priced . they around long time not bells whistles . sunpak auto/f-stop manual . if you real photographer , you know how use them . down side if your sunpak plugged into wall , it takes far too long recharge ( sometimes 3-5 seconds ) . rechargeable batteries seem work best 1-3 second recharge times flashes .	1
i enjoy convenience point shoot digital camera . my minolta dimage ( 15% small size than this camera ) reached end its useful life , around 5 years . minolta 3/4 " screen back . ( this one 2.5 " screen- great colors)the best feature i liked my old camera fact there not telescoping zoom lens . i don't like fact part needs move so often possibility get gummed up dirty . therefore , i excited this camera internal zoom . tonight i bulls game , 300 section ( nose bleed ) , able zoom get individual photo kirk hinrich . 3x optical zoom incredible , but more so incredible digital zoom . i also able zoom into jumbotron , it looked crisp if i taking photo directly . action shots great . low light shots great ! it exactly what i looking	1
i absolutely love this camera . i got it 3 months ago i cnt imagine life w/o it . im 13 nd mega clumsy nd it still not one single scratch it . it eats up batteries but so wat ? i love it buy it	1
housing worked great . took it 80ft scuba diving flash colors came out ok . no leaks access all functions plus .	1
i love this camcorder . it very easy use , piture quality great . you record wide screen or full screen . light weight , fits palm your hand which more stable less shaky when taping . controls within easy reach while taping . it so easy use both my kids even using it they only 9 6 . it also great price . can't wait all our summer vacations start taping . i bought this camcorder two weeks ago best buy . i just wrote my review then read others i add this , there comments made you hear tape while recording then play back . i slightly hear noise when i am taping , but i cannot hear it when i am playing it my dvd player . hear noise while taping you it right next your ear . but not noticable playback computer or through dvd player	1
i am just average guy when it comes using camera . probably below average . i started trying use 100% sony electronic products because my computer sony sony-sony linkages make easy use . given , here what i think product : 1 . it amazing how much camera you get money . compared just 6 months ago , or year ago , this lot camera money . it very small , fits easily your pocket , but takes great pictures . also , it very easy use recharge . 2 . visit sony website , suggests sony new cameras coming out constantly -- new cameras very similar . this makes it hard compare cameras , even within sony brand , makes you feel if your camera obsolete minute you buy it . 3 . problem this camera , given it so small -- not shake . your pictures blurry . i am typical guy , very little fine motor control . my hands trouble holding small objects . holding this camera one hand taking picture -- well results not pleasant . 4 . i tend disappointed telephoto capabilities these small cameras . i guess if you really want zoom , then you go big camera . but it still seems like small cameras could offer more . 5 . said all , end , this camera small easy carry , light weight , durable , it also easy use . when you look it , it looks well made . i ended up giving camera my in-laws , because they lost theirs . my in-laws tend technologically challenged . i said them , just leave dial set little green camera , snap away . i say - they love this camera . overall . money , great purchase , technology amazing . just grab it two hands or develop steadier aim than i .	1
excellent camcorder . only thing i would different spend little more it would take go up pv-gs85	1
i several digital cameras this tops them all !!!! everything they say it , true . i love not even think batteries , i didn't believe what people said battery life , i just happy i didn't need think batteries , but i just got married my 13 year old daughter took more than 100 pictures this camera her pictures almost good photographer i hired yes camera battery lasted all day thru next 4 days our honeymoon 200 pictures taken , no low battery light !!!!! i even going buy my parents one . also , one more note i love how fast you take pictures , no wait 4 seconds shots . i kodak digital before only 1 1/2 years old hated it , i hated download procedure , it didn't put your pictures onto your hard drive , but it own little cubbyhole trying attach them your email absolutely nightmare , you'd identify picture copy it your desktop , remember what you called it then attach it your email . this main reason why i purchased this camera . i never own anything else , especially kodak .	1
i bought this underwater housing anticipation trip galapagos . it worked perfectly , i obtained some really incredible shots , both still video . combination canon sd550 this housing amazing . i make sure lubricate primary o-ring each time i opened housing . but need so reduced using larger , 1gb memory card - both card battery would last little over two dives , before i need change one or other	1
kodak v705 black : small , carry pocket . wide angle lens , great group photos . fast start up time . video mode easy , built mic picks up all sounds . camera stitch 3 photos together-great vistas . i am happy this camera . bought v705 silver my friend she loves it . kodak makes easy take photos . weak flash- try not more than 6-8 feet away-or use photoshop photos	1
this accessory very useful when taking group pictures photographer included	1
best binoculars i owned , i many . excellent clarity , great field view too . nice size also not big , not small . you cant go wrong this fine set , highly recommended	1
reading reviews this camera reminds me cameras tools . imperfect tool hands master much better than perfect tool hands amatuer . i am not master , but i appreciate this camera what it what its limitations . when you use iso settings higher than 200 you see increased noise . i think it great little camera i used it lot my latest photo project . keep mind one assets this camera its small physical size . this also means small optical lens = less light gathering ability . there no way compensate this camera - so know this limitation deal it .	1
this very good camera price range . i always good luck sony products , unlike some reviewers here . resolution viewer window image quality itself more than what i would expect camera this price range .... it pretty decent . what most people use dv cams , this camera doesn't suck all . i like how tiny it . it doesn't go much past palm my hand when i'm holding it . also it very easy figure out just exploring menu touch pad . color graphics icons menus add nice touch . beginner could start filming very soon after opening box , i think . camera feels sturdy my hand , i mean i don't feel like viewer window going break off when it open or i could easily break buttons normal use . others mentioned , you buy 4 6 firewire if you mac because ilink cable comes it s-video input tvs . also battery comes it 30 minute battery but i would bought extra one anyway because you never want wait around while your only battery charging . software cd do-it-yourself install , least mac . it might not pc . i'm used guided through installation process ... ( since least early 90's!) but i drag folder my hard drive my darn self . minor thing but i would expected more major company like sony . but reason i give it 4 star rating instead 5 because firewire goes into base , not camera so you cannot camera tripod while it connected your machine . i realize this not big problem very many people but since i stop-motion animation use frame grabbing software , i need it connected firewire tripod while i'm working . i almost returned camera when i discovered this but instead i hot glued velcro bottom base my tripod adaptor so i could firewire plugged attached tripod .... kinda ghetto . i figure it worth it though since i got such good camera price ( i paid $299 sale it . ) if you're looking decent but cheap camera i would recommend either this one or hc42 if you want shoot widescreen .	1
i am female bowhunter who really trouble judjing distances green fields . this great product . it easy use very accurate	1
all-purpose color film , i nearly always shoot fuji 200 speed . it cooler tones i prefer my images good saturation level . only drawback i've seen while looking various film prices here they way over-priced ! only place i've seen where you pay more film supermarkets . any regular camera store or photo finisher this stuff lot less , you won't wait it ship	1
this film great color production performance . price also just right . you can't go wrong fujifilm superia x-tra 400	1
my printer fits perfectly , plenty room paper tray , extra paper few other things i managed get also . i love this bag .... thank	1
after researching several cameras this price range , i bought rebel t2 last month . it met my expectations perhaps then some . after recently trying out friends camera 150 . -ish range , i partially regret spending what i . it all comes down what you need , want , how many bells whistles you like . money though , compared competitors , i still think i made good purchase . after all , if i use it ten years , which i most likely , i surely got my moneys worth . bottom line : no complaints it	1
yes this very good first camcorder . i am first time user any cam corder . i olny mine month or so but i made several films it it very inersting . but software harder use movie maker . but if you first time buyer then i would go this becasuse 20gb engough use .. but battery life short but u wont need make feature length film !!! it just fantastic . enjoy ..	1
this cable came cheap packing it not any logo it so you can't say which company it belongs . i used lot sony products i feel it not up standard sony . it works great no problems so far . it flexible kinds so you don't worry positioning your laptop according your tv .	1
so far , i really love this camera . it very user friendly gives you option put it very basic mode or normal mode . what attracted me purchasing this camera because long battery life because picture quality . it large viewing area which nice it very clear . i recommend this camera	1
i've this digital camera almost year . it fourth camera i've owned . i spent quite some time searching compact camera i could carry everywhere . amateur photographer ( mostly taking pictures myself not others ) , i didn't want lug around extra bag just my camera . it fits discreetly your pocket or small purse ( formal nights out ) . size weight this camera its best feature , this carries through newer generations this camera , too . this perfect camera everything selling items on-line landscape scenery . my pictures always turned out beautifully , wonderful color crispness . i discovered " automatic " lighting feature not always most ideal , but you re-program just anything this camera . it really quite good camera , given its price these days newer generations out there , it steal	1
this great camera- it so thin , takes amazing pictures , even when subject moving . best shot option makes taking pictures under any kind lighting great quality . i suggest this anyone	1
this camera case great . it very small fits my coolpix 4600 perfectly . there enough room fit extra memory card some batteries ( but batteries make it tight ) . i originally purchased camera case listed 4600 , but it little bulky zipper could scratch camera if you aren't careful . this camera case not come strap like other , but something i would never use . i highly recommend this case those who want small sleek case protect their camera .	1
considering price this camera works great , i use it taking family pics wonderful . what i dont like lack zoomgreat product anyway	1
new olympus stylus 770sw nicest camera date i've purchased . it takes great pictures extremely durable . picture quality awesome all types weather conditions lighting . i stronly suggest purchase this if price right	1
i bought this camera more than half year ago . my intention get decent camera images , but then also able use it filming short movies . i'm very pleased its performance . good lighting conditions , colors come out amazing . i really really not expect them so vivid sparkling ! darker conditions , well , it still works fine , not nearly bad i expected some other reviews . photos might grainy or not vivid anymore , but stuff still perfectly suitable show photos people . filming , it terrific . i mean , resolution great ( sth like 848 640 or so ) , better than what one could possibly expect regular camera . quality super awesome , looks very neat computer screen . respect . it pointed out you cannot zoom while filming , but not many cameras out there . oh , it also very small gigantic screen great battery life . great buy	1
proving there life old dog yet , bushnell come up this , successor out-dated , poor-performing trophy splashproof spotting scope , i say , it fantastic improvement . soon i took it out box i impressed its styling , shape , colour , course , waterproofness . i set it up my front room spent happy couple hours watching my neighbours coming going , they oblivious my surveillance . it not most subtle ' scope out there but stick blanket over your head you're laughing . any one who caught out rain appreciate this little beauties moulded plastic housing , water really roll off it like , erm , water off duck back . stunning	1
i liked this lens . i used it , first time , while traveling through peru . it light-weight easy use . 200mm , most my pictures turned out great , especially when i steady ground ( taking pictures rocking boat no tripod bit challenge ! ) . i've printed some 8x10 close-ups i took using this lens i quite impressed quality . it also my price range . overall , i'd say it " good bang buck .	1
i deal major brand cameras panasonic cameras my personal favorite ! i've seen people whine " noise " they make many times but never found it problem . i own fz10 fx01 my personal cameras . fx01 very fast camera takes great pics ! i love 28mm wide lens . compared most cameras i've used fx01 real good job metering light exposing images . i love panasonic solid build reliability . they may not popular canon or sony but my opinion every bit good .	1
i own this camcorder 6 monthit good camcorder , esay use , easy bringas it design purpose , pc-55 enough home useonly one thing i want mention here , before i buy this camcorder , i thought i record video ms duo mepg format , it easy post-edit pc , you know , tansfer minidv tape computer may need huge space save . however , when i replay video which stored ms , sreen full mosaicfortunately , when use dv type record , this situation never happens . good quality . one press photo button also becomes useless because bad quality	1
this my first camcorder , so i don't much compare it , but i've enjoyed it so far . it easy use . picture quality seems high . only minor problem i've found headphone input . try three different sets headphones before i could find one would fit into narrow slot where headphone jack	1
getting great pictures this new flash my sony digital slr camera	1
i ordered this hoping it would fit my camera accessories it . i stylus 750 plus pop up screen shade , extra battery , extra picture card . there two slots specifically designed fit two picture cards inside cover . main compartment , small slit fit extra battery or two plus creit card perhaps bit paper money . ( it won't fit much more than , though . ) it compact , stylish functional--i'm glad i bought it	1
i looking specifically magic combination all-around video still camera compact built very solid i travel easily . i this camera since dec 19th , 2006 . i very bad luck my previous camera , canon elura used minidvs . when it worked , videos great , but cassette mechanism kept falling out adjustment failing trips or gatherings , i lost many unrecoverable moments ! i extended warranty sent it back 3 times , but they never able fix it properly . perhaps this unusual lemon , but i not want take chance again ! many media types , i've told sd cards most durable almost indestructable . i liked idea no moving parts recording videos . addition , i tired separate digital video camera , technology finally arrived combine two . non-professional camera person looking catch candid home travel shots videos , i've found this great little camera . it amazingly small , really fit coat pocket . extremely solid , it also snap use , yet still provides powerful manual override abilities . camera turns within few seconds . video colors extremely natural not oversaturated any way , resolution very fine . microphone works well , course there no " tape hiss " since there no tape . still photos fair quality . i printed some 8 10 they looked decent : however , if very-high quality photos what you after this not camera you . again , this definitely snap-and-shoot-for-memories crowd , not people who want win photography awards . miniscule pop-up flash amazingly powerful . i also looked sanyo which competing sd model higher still photo resolution ability , but it not any motion compensation ability . given how small these cameras , it not possible hand-hold without jiggling it lot , so i ruled sanyo out . okay , now negatives . there quite few , but what it i still found this best camera my purposes :( 1 ) camera not record well low-light conditions , i'm sure due light required 3ccd color processing small size lens ( cost compact ! ) . filming indoors requires pretty good light ensure decent videos . my christmas tree light pictures disappointing , my backlit scenes came out looking like shadow-puppet plays . ( 2 ) cost buying additional 4gb cards high , i am worried misplacing them because they so small . ( 3 ) i experienced wide swings over- under-exposed still photos using flash , although i ( usually ) able balance brightness contrast my photo editor . i'm sure this partly due not used camera yet , but whole idea not worry such things . flash fill-in backlit subjects works amazingly well . ( 4 ) lcd display camera not synchronized same level brightness contrast your tv set or your pc , which you adjust upwards during playback . thankfully , my sony tv allows custom adjustments each input source . ditto when you creating dvd ... you need increase brightness contrast match what you see when playing back scene through camera own lcd viewer . ( 5 ) there no still photo zoom playback camera ( least i not found it yet ) . frequently , i think snapped photo comes out okay , only realize when " zooming " image pc review details it slightly blurry i need retake it . ( 6 ) you need use included software view mpeg2 videos , mpeg2 not included driver editing tools i've reviewed . ( 7 ) there no still photo editing software included , only video software . i supposed panasonic assumes everyone their own photo editing software already , but i didn't . my canon photo editing software works these photos , so i am using . ( 8 ) finally , battery fits inside enclosed compartment , so you not able buy extended battery pack . since there no energy required running hard drive , dvd burner or tape , admittedly batteries seem last longer before recharging , but i still can't see taking trip less than 2-3 packs . i guess i spending extra more batteries ! even these drawbacks , there no doubt this amazing sleek winner really no competitor its class i intend use heavily home my travels	1
i went ( thinking it cheaper ) ebay route- $10 more i got new one here it works . ebay nice , but when it comes stuff like this i learned my lesson . i've never gone wrong ordering amazon , fact i just ordered oem nb-3l battery my sd500 ; tried radio slop route it won't go over 20 pictures . again , shame me trying go cheap	1
i several different binoculars small hand held large pair nikon i use wildlife spotting . i never anything performs nearly well these . i am serious nature wildlife photographer used high end canon photography equipment years . when i saw image stabilized binocular available " " glass , ( this symbol canon uses identify their finest optics camera lenses ) , i bought them immediately . these binoculars little bit heavier than non stabilized pair , but weight easily compensated stabilizer . once you press stabilizer button , scene lock , effect amazing . i tested them looking sign 100 yards away . my normal hand shake i could not read sign distance . soon i engaged stabilizer , image locked into place never once moved . it performs well my camera lenses . far optics , they , my opinion second none world . image significantly brighter than any other set i , calrity sharpness incredible . night viewing capabilities incredible . finally , huge plus these binoculars completely fog weather sealed . change amibient temps , use them rain , not allow condensation get into unit . wonderful feature those us use our equipment other than nice weather . things aware include : these relatively large , which suit medium large hand size . if you very small hands , your may not like feel unit your hands . second , lens caps not perform well . they simple not stay unit . although me this not serious issue , it one area canon could much better job . you get around this issue attaching good uv filter lenses . ( you should probably this anyway protect glass)finally , strap carry case comes poor . it too thin comfortably worn extended use . i would recommend you find really comfortable aftermarket camera strap use these . summary : outstanding performance quality . little larger fell your hands than some people may like , but once you learn use them , i not believe any serious birdwatcher or sports fan would ever let them go ! i give canon binoculars 5 star rating .	1
loved this ! it awesome because it both land sea camera , so you need just one ! you get tons accessories flashes it . it easy use program it comes allows you all kinds cool corrections including making your photos more focus case you shot them blurry ! i cannot wait use it again , well underwater diving i mean	1
hoods offer several benefits photographer . primarily hood shades lens stray light may result unwanted discoloration or hazing image , or appearance lens flare . shading your lens helps improve contrast image quality . hood not required eliminate these problems , any item used shade lens provide same protection stray light . hood convenient it built offer protection while ensuring it not inadvertently find its way into your image . photographers often state protective abilities hood reason one . this hood solid petal shapped three three quarters inch long offers some protection keeping moisture wind blown debris off lens element . there nothing more irritating than reviewing your images find dust spots or other flaws . when place , hood protect lens impacting solid objects . replacing damaged hood usually cheaper than repairing or replacing expensive lens . this hood manufactured canon 70-200mm f/ 2.8 ef lens normally comes included lens when sold new . there no need buy one amazon often suggests . since hood wider than lens ; it easily stored attached reverse position . this doesn't add length lens , but make it wider inch . inch may not seem like lot , but tightly packed camera bag , it huge . fortunately canon provides storage case lens used addition your camera bag . while protective benefits exist , they secondary limited . i find impact hood my image quality more convincing reason use hood . considering impact image quality low cost compared my other camera equipment ( except lens case ) , purchasing hood money well spent . pros : improves contrast image quality offers limited protection lens cons : takes up more space your camera bag store len	1
i humped this thing around dc last week 7 hours , not worry mention . well balanced , i it full camera , 4 lenses , flash miscellany . i cut all extra straps off , just shoulder harness left . it looks good too . course , it great advertisement thieves so never let it out your grip .	1
this monopod very sturdy easy set up . i looking monopod capable handling weight my large canon lens ( over 3 lbs ) , this one job very well . i mainly use it taking soccer pictures , so far , i'm very pleased . i highly recomend it	1
i use this monopod my pentax optio w20 camera panasonic video camera . i use it when camping it doubles sturdy walking stick . when i'm out wilds people think it walking stick until they see my small camera perched top it . it really improved my ability stay steady blur free my new pentax which no optical viewfinder . i like quick adjustment legs opposed screw type . i've also used this tripod stick my video camera out my sunroof cruise through new england catch autumnal leaves while driving which given some interesting results . i plan same thing rt 1 film big sur highway . only thing i need get ball head adjust angle camera . price this steal hearty deal	1
mp100 served us well since getting it 2 months ago . like other reviewers , i wasn't expected whole lot after disappointed $40 monopod made those well under 6 feet tall . quite stable , usable walking stick , easier reset height than competition under $50 twist-lock legs . this monopod definitely exceeded my expectations ! seems niche here higher priced version pan/tilt head , but i 30yr old leica table top tripod pan/tilt head combination works great ! balance , can't beat even if all you order mp100 pay $6 or so s/h ! use beach or where dirt grit air , you'll want wipe down legs before collapsing ( cloth used gun storage work great ) or you may grit legs scratching mp100 legs subsequent use .	1
this my favorite lens . i could not carry heavier long range teles , it hard decision me . end , i chose this because it lighter than zooms . previouly used 75-300 zoom , i leary getting 300mm prime , because i may miss 70-300 range shooting . but clarity colors so true this 300 prime , i don't look back . easy handle , not so bulky . fast , impressive photos . even when i add 1.4 teleconverter shooting 500mm range my 20d . i use f4 alot , no problem , great clarity . awesome lens price	1
amazing quality affordable price ( still not cheap tho ) . this lens takes great quality photos my daytime/outdoor performer . although i don't think equal 1 f-stop when it comes low light situations but it sure very helpful these high f-stop numbers	1
while this review not technical others all i say quality end result well worth money ! i shot wedding this past weekend 2 days after receiving this lens am just going over some photos all i say this piece glass given me razor sharpness i've looking . i've hesitant into jumping into " " lens arena but now i'm here i could never go back ! don't settle less ! your photography worth it	1
i both lenses , 24-105 4 28-135 3.5 - 5.6 . i 20d , but my wife i decided we each wanted camera ourselves so i bought 24-105 lens 30d 2 months ago . i so sure i'd see big difference lens since my 70-200 2.8 such superior lens . thing , i can't justify it . i've set camera tripod switched lenses back forth taking pictures identical light settings variety subjects . ( they both take extremely nice pictures ) maybe full frame sensor difference would apparent . this point i like extra reach 135mm . i'll let my wife use $1200 lens . my recommendation : money cropped sensor camera i'd stick 28-135 lens	1
everyone gives this lens rave so maybe i should approach this terrific lens shooting pov . shooting wide open f2at 135 gives your pictures distinct quality you would never get zooms , there isn't zoom this focal length this speed either . few primes come close but they're nowhere near sharp wide open . af fast very accurate lens great feel 20d/5d/10d body even wo battery grip cameras . close up magnification . 19x . 21 therabouts nice bonus this lens , letting you get closer wo too your face tight headshots . i always felt photographers usually sweet spot when shooting certain things like some portrait photographers like distance 85mm gives them when approaching subject , turns out i'm liking 135 focal length quite bit headshots 85 torso head shots . one thing i like this 135/f2 combo there enough dof get most main subject view focus but background still blurred out . it really great when you want subject focus nothing else , opposed 85 1.2 parts subject could melt into background resulting images little too ethreal some tastes . couldn't you just stop down 85 ? sure but relationship foreground background would still different 135 . 135 f2 give result that juuust right . backgrounds just little more compressed foreground but foreground sharp but background gone . almost like you lurred background photoshop . but you'll never get same results blurring photoshop , one thing highlights would get muddied blur treatment ps while highlights stay clean f2 . don't just use this thing portraits , use it way you would use 50mm try frame such , again focal lenth wide aperture give interesting result . i basically use it candids portraits during wedding . fantastic lens , very sharp , very handholdable , focal length terrific portraits bokeh very beautiful , equal sharpness 85 1.2 or any canon $5k lenses . this probably best lens you get price , only lens i've used better saturation contrast 35 1.4 . downside : not handholdable 50 , 35 1.4 or 85 1.2 during low light situations due it focal length	1
man . what lens !!! it not cheap , i dont ' find 135mm particularly useful focal length my 20d but after seeing glowing reviews this one both [ ... ] , i decided buy one try it myself . it not cheap $900 , but it worth every penny . this one absolute stunner . i cannot believe my eyes sharpness f2 it improves very little when stopped down . bokeh unbelievable !!! i dont ' hesitate shoot f2 i don't find it necessary stop down just increase sharpness . size build perfect although i don't like canon hood design . why can't they simply make hood same crincked finish lens ?? then they would not so easily scratch . it beyond me . but that not problem lens itself whenever i use this lens , i know i one best lenses ever designed . it forces me excel myself knowing now , only limitation me , photographer not camera or lens . absolute beauty . go try it yourself . i try shoot this much possible results stunning . i just wish it came weather proofing image stablization like canon modern lenses but that just nitpicking . i love it it	1
i am really impressed results i get this lens . this my first usm lens 85mm new me . it serves me really well taking people pictures outside - fantastic background blur fast enough low light indoor close ups . full time manual focus handy too times . my tamron 17-50 , this lens great combo me	1
i decided rave this lens after taking 80 portraits , or head shots , children theater production . i set aperture 1.8 shot away inside temple great indirect soft lighting . results exquisite ! background , located five feet behind subjects subtle blur while subjects came life ( single strands hair resolution ) . not bad my first experience shooting portraits . now better part i get equal or better results thousands pictures i taken high school basketball games . i set my iso 400 my digital rebel xt get shutter speeds 1/200 1/1250 . again , intended subject jumps out . there no red eye ( or white eye ) using flash light scene freeze action . so after much experimenting , i prefer this my 70-200 f4/l my 24-105 f4/l lenses indoor sports lens . i love all these lenses . this one wins area price fastest lens . this my lens choice majority my current shooting situations .	1
i bought this filter put front 18-70 dx lens my nikon d50 . it works well protects front element lens dust , dirt , fingerprints whatnot . it seems cause little vignetting ( slightly darkened corners ) extreme wide angles ( ~ 18mm ) -- but what i've seen so far it isn't terribly noticeable , ' specially price	1
this hood comes 100-400 , so don't buy it separately . pros : - reduces flare ghosting when shooting bright light . - helps protect your lens dirt scratches . - somewhat protects lens case fall . better break hood than front element . - makes you look more like you know what you doing helps keep others carelessly walking front you . cons : - increase lens movement windy situations , kind like sail boat . - takes up more room your bag , even when reversed they still add diameter lens . - people take more notice you , help blow your cover if you trying keep low profile	1
i've used canon eos 10d 5 months now i'm absolutely thrilled it . eos cameras extremely comfortable hold handle . auto mode , camera produces correctly exposed , sharp photos . unlike my canon powershot , camera takes picture very little delay after depressing shutter button . creative zones , you set aperture priority take , example , selective focus shots , or use shutter speed priority set slow shutter speed take some good blurring shots . auto focus quick accurate , though how much camera how much lens i not know . i never use manual focus mode . pop-up flash works great lighting subject shadows or back lit . i now find it bit frustrating use my film camera ; i'm addicted viewing my shots spot . i canon eos a2 film camera i purchased 1995 . since i'm familiar eos system canon system lenses , i chose 10d over similarly priced nikon prosumer digital camera . i like my canon cameras so well i bought canon digital elf my sister canon powershot a80 my mother . both reportedly excellent cameras . 10d , i've used canon 50mm/compact macro , tamron 28-200mm canon 15mm fisheye lens . because difference way film camera this digital camera operate , you multiply focal length lens 1.6 figure effective focal length when used digital camera . so , example , 15mm fisheye lens effectively 24mm lens 1 0d.i bought 1 gig imb microdrive storage card allows me take 400 high res jpg or 160 raw format files . if you shoot auto mode , camera only capture jpg format . if you shoot manual mode , you select jpg or raw format . if shooting raw format , ensure you software program , such photoshop cs , open raw files . know not all developing printing shops accept raw format . but many image libraries only accept raw files ( or high resolution tif scanned slide ) . raw format files , i've found many my shots require bit exposure adjustment , but this simply matter moving slider bar photoshop cs . when you first open raw file , you get adjustment window allowing you play exposure , tint , saturation , white balance more . you even simulate warmup filters such . very cool stuff ! i bought extra battery take trips . one battery typically lasts me 2 days shooting , long i don't much reviewing my shots through camera monitor . unless you need quality 1ds immediately i would recommend getting 10d because technology moving so fast quality 1ds available current price 10d near future	1
i also received this remote only international warranty . i called amazon they immediately sent me out replacement free charge ; yeah . but alas , it too international warranty ; @#$% !. i returned both , unopened unused their dime . perhaps this only version they	1

like most every canon accessory , 580ex well made very expensive . i cheaped out when i bought my digital rebel bought sigma ef-500 dg , which represented " almost good " canon 580ex . appears true . problem " almost " leaves me no master/slave lighting . so when i picked up eos 30d , i bit bullet paid big bucks canon . it works advertised nicely makes sigma slave it really born	1
i feel these filters not required if you digital camera coze you you what ever you like computer graphics programs only uv protector important	1
... it diffuses light energy flash different directions , essentially turning flash into point light source . light going off different directions then bounces off nearby objects fill shadow areas subject , making more pleasing softer look , especially people . note caution : because this device diffuses light flash , it takes much more energy per flash . using stofen drain your battery much quicker ( 4x my experience ) it takes flash much longer fully charge after each shot , say 8-10 seconds vs 2-3s . always keep spare set flash batteries you . note ... because it requires bouncing light nearby objects effective , using this outdoors not recommended . you're better off removing omni-bounce aiming flash directly subject ( living harsh lighting ) .	1
this my lens handheld images birds flight . it sharp exhibits no color fringing or other chromatic aberration . comparison , my leitz 400mm f/ 6.8 telyt shows fair amount color fringing outside center region . fair , telyt much simpler design . telyt higher contrast than ef 400mm f/4 , but levels layer photoshop fix . 400mm f/4 much lighter than any 400mm f/4 lens conventional optics . lenses diffraction element compensates color dispersion spherical lens elements . it also reduces optical complexity size . f/4 speed makes autofocus faster , allows even better isolation subjects using narrow depth field . while bigger heavier than canon 400mm f/ 5.6 , f/4 lens light enough 4.3 pounds it still easy carry . i've used mine hikes above 10,000 feet photograph bighorn sheep . definitely makes difference handheld , tripod below 1/125 second . canon 400mm f/ 5.6 non-stabilized lens . i've taken some my sharpest wildlife images this lens - you see every feather some bird shots . highly recommended if you afford one .	1
photos excellent . but photo print quality depends very much print shop . same photo file , it look like 4m photo when taken below quality printer shop . photos taken indoor marginal lighting ( no flash used ) turned out yellowish . battery life very long despite its large 3 " lcd . battery charging time over 3 hours - too long . photos files viewed computer looks just great . 8'x10 ' prints great but not tried larger prints . touch screeen control delight very easy choose set . date photo red ( would better if it black ) . location date not far right hand corner	1
good quality filter set great price . i so happy it i purchased sets all my lenses cameras ! same filters my local camera store more than double price	1
if you big lenses ( 400mm f/ 2.8 usm or even 70-200mm f/ 2.8 usm ) this totally worth addition . 2x not kill autofocus f/ 2.8 effectively doubles your lens very little distortion around edges . check compatability canon website . you won't disappointed	1
this high quality extender great addition my canon ef 70-200 f/4 !! top-notch build quality tough , weather resistant design equal their highly respected line quot ; lquot ; lenses , canon produced great product its unbeatable zoom lens !! although 2x extender renders a/f function useless many canon cameras , i found this very small drawback overall ( i prefer manually focus under many my shooting conditions ) . this extender more suited low f/number lens due 2-stop change brightness , but it still very effective my f/4 normal lighting . lightweight fairly inexpensive way double your focal length , while maintaining incredible optical quality main lens ... my backpack always contain my 2x 1.4 extenders !	1
i am professional photographer , i owned this camera nearly two years . i also d70 backup . batteries go forever , it very quick respond , images beautiful , it typical nikon durability reliability . if you already nikon user , controls fall easily hand . said , computer software this camera joke . best image quality shoot raw files , color balance grey card , render images software like capture one le . uselessness included software only reason this camera gets four instead five stars . come , nikon , real !!! shortly after i got my first d70 , i shot model small photo side bar catalog . i got ugly feeling my gut when i told designer taken shot 3/4 figure , cropped head shoulders , enlarged image cover 8.5 11 catalog . time i found out , it already printer . it turned out , i pleasantly surprised : cover shot looked great . after incident , i trusted this camera always pleased results . this camera better than 35 mm every way except response shutter button . resolution color reproduction it more comparable medium format film camera . it imperative shoot raw process files properly get most out this camera . i can't wait try d80	1
excellent camera kit . versatile . i lot learn camera , though , it no simple point-and-shoot . however , auto mode , it takes great point-and-shoot pictures . i look forward learning how use it fully . lenses came warranty cards , but camera itself not . i bought sb-600 flash well battery two 1 gb compact flash cards round out kit . camera lens attached large , which i underestimated . $80 camera bag too small it all . great camera , though . price best i could find anywhere	1
i am 67 years old started out photography kid contact printer box camera . i all types cameras over years , mostly 35mm film canon slr . i too bought all sorts these 5-7 mp point shoot digital cameras before returning my true love , slr . i my digital canon rebel xt month now i can't keep my hands off it . it lacks nothing . although kit lense good , i bought 28-135 canon zoom lense image stabilizion produced stunning photo it . i love way you use 7 points focus , i mainly use only center point focus lock never get out focus picture . i guess nicest thing me i now don't urge buy every point shoot camera paraded out qvc or hsn " wonderful " new feature like " low light or non-shake . " this canon every good feature known universe you can't outgrow it . its camera let you good you , it won't hold you back . battery life great , built flash good but i bought 430ex that even better . i never figure i'm wasting money buying accessories this camera it my main squeeze many years come . i always missed my 35mm canon slr now feel i old friend back again , only much much better . believe me , you can't go wrong getting this camea , its beyond description ...	1

this camera really great . i knew i liked it before , but i immediately began appreciate this camera all more when i ended up rebel xt " loaner " while my 20d repair . not xt bad camera , it just doesn't really compare 20d . 20d nice feel it ; it fairly large , which great since i somewhat large hands . features great too . image quality awesome . i don't really need go into all details , most other reviewers excellent job . let me just say it great camera worth five stars . only complaint i camera it doesn't spot metering . ability your light metering off single point interest would great - they add it 30d .	1
i delighted quality pictures i get this lens . autofocus fast quiet , while manual focus very solid smooth . i'm finally taking pictures worthy jewelry my partner creates	1
i bought this lens little over year ago macro shooting . i quickly found out , however , shoot macr o-o nly this lens crime . it very versitile lens . its fast f/ 2.8 aperture makes good shooting low light . i pretty much use this outdoors 100mm 1.6 crop factor my rebel xt eliminates most indoor oppurtunities . i frequently use this lens family portraits , resultant photo so crisp clear bokeh really helps add snap primary subject . others stated , this heavy lens . it doesn't image stabilization ( ) so tripod or monopod great accessory get best images . i use beefy monopod my best shots , although i lot handheld gems ... if you tight cash , this isn't " one lens " it all . if you looking versitile lens outstanding macros portraits , this lens .	1
this fantastic lens not only macro shots but portraits too . extra distance allows far more flexibility when out . tried both 50 , 60 100mm - i'm glad i went 100mm	1
walkaround lens . this very topic leads heated discussion among dslr photographers . first , determine your budget , focal length , aperture needs . if you frequently find yourself zooming out get everything frame , you want wide angle lens such this . if you frequently find yourself zooming , this not lens you . full frame body such canon eos 5d , this lens becomes ultra wide angle . aps-c crop body such digital rebel xti ( which i used this review ) , it becomes medium wide angle . but thanks 1.6 crop factor , this lens expands more usable 35mm equivalent focal length 27 64mm . second , audition lens if you . definition , walkaround lens should relatively portable . 1.1 lbs ., canon ef 17-40mm f/4l usm neither super light nor neck breakingly heavy . fact , it weighs almost same digital rebel xti -- really nice balance . lens feels very solid supreme build quality only l-series lenses offer . although this lens weather proof therefore sealed against liquid dust , i strongly recommend getting 77mm filter protect front lens element . it , this lens made last . terms looks feel , it doesn't get much better . its rubberized full-time inner focus manual ring usm focuses smoothly , quietly , quickly . since it inner focus , lens not extend beyond its metal casing whether you zoom or out . focus window shows focusing distance 0.28 meter ( 0.92 feet ) infinity . focal length marker indicates 17 , 20 , 24 , 28 , 35 , 40mm . lens exudes quality tip tip . you may tolerate heavier lens or may not mind lesser build quality cheaper lenses . walkaround lens used very often , so make sure you comfortable i t.t his lens famous saturated color deep contrast . its images simply stunning . 17mm wide angle , barrel distortion noticeable but relatively mild . 24mm 40mm , its images distortion free perfectly suited capturing people . vignetting ( corner darkness ) minimal mild chroma abberrations ( color shadows ) . f/4 aperture , details become noticeably softer toward edges . center region very sharp f/ 5.6 , edges remain fairy sharp . thanks 7 diaphragm blades , this lens produce very nice bokeh 40mm ( blur effects ) . one most cited weaknesses f/4 aperture . my experience , bump iso speed steady hands all you need take well focused images indoor . other hand , if you shooting very little amount light , you might wish f/ 2.8 or image stabilizer . although difference f/4 f/ 2.8 just 1 stop , my other lens , canon ef 24-70mm f/ 2.8 usm ( too heavy my walkaround lens ) easily outperforms such challenging situations . but large , i not handicapped f/4 aperture . some main competitions ( sorted price ): - sigma 18-50mm f/ 2.8 ex dc : arguably best wide angle lens limited budget . focus mechanism bit slow , corner very soft , chroma abberrations bit issue , lens highly prone flare . works only ef-s mount . - sigma af 17-70mm f/ 2.8 - 4.5 dc macro : bit more expensive than sigma 18-50mm , but wider focal range macro capability . - canon ef-s 17-85mm f/4- 5.6 usm : this " traveler lens " wider focal range than most wide angle lenses ( widest among canon ) equipped image stabilizer . but lens famous extreme barrel distortion 17mm chroma abberrations . works only ef-s mount . - tamron sp af 17-50mm f/ 2.8 di ii ld aspherical ( if ): this most direct competitor . it takes sharper images faster aperture while costing less . both build focus mechanism significantly worse , but should good enough many . works only ef-s mount . - canon ef-s 17-55mm f/ 2.8 usm : this reference , if you afford it . its images razor sharp details great performance all around ( minus vignetting , which typical ef-s lenses ) . build quality worse than l-series but not too shabby . works only ef-s mount . this best ef-s lens hands down . - canon ef 16-35mm f/ 2.8 usm : one most expensive wide angle zoom lenses . it larger heavier , but f/ 2.8 aperture . this how canon ef 17-40mm f/4 usm stacks up . pros : - among very best build quality . - excellent , buttery smooth , super fast front-focus system . - top notch color contrast . very sharp center resolution . - almost non-existent vignetting , generally low distortion , well controlled chroma abberrations . - ideal weight size walkaround purposecons : - edge softness f/4 aperture . - narrower focal length than most competing lenses . - slower than some third party lenses . all all , this excellent wide angle walkaround lens . it may not offer most bang buck , but if you value full frame compatibility ( ef lens mount ) excellent build quality , this default choice . this lens comes nice pouch lens hood . i find hood somewhat ridiculously shaped because lens resistant flare , i not use it often when shooting outdoor	1
i am really glad i bought this lens . it comes hood which reversed when not use so it very useful . leather pouch , front cap , back cap included . focusing super fast usm .	1
may i introduce you one least know yet most superb lenses canon makes . you probably even stumbled this page accident , looking canon lens , looking various macros , or even just intrigued this higher-priced lens you've probably never even considered . let me just say this this lens : ultra sharp . ultra colorful . ultra contrast . ultra solid . like everybody else , i initially bought this lens its macro . 60mm 100mm options lot cheaper , but my collection entirely l-class i'd learned trust putting gobs money into lenses red ring . so i put my money where my l-faith went this lens . needless say , my faith rewarded again . yeah , sure it got 1.0 macro capability , this important . but what i wasn't expecting image quality . it unbelievably good . now i'm not somebody who taking his first trip into land comparing this lens $300 run-of-the-mill glass . i've used six l-class lenses significantly i'm comparing this lens ' image quality those . you find yourself using this lens much its 180mm focal length f/ 3.5 aperture dictates . lens versatile both super-fine telephoto 1.0 macro . macro capability main feature . 1.0 macro literally means 35mm wide object completely fill 35mm frame . basically , it small microscope . if you dare dial aperture wide-open f/ 3.5 , dof approximately thickness two sheets writing paper 1.0 . needless say , you'll need tripod , preferably macro rails slide forwards rearwards ultimate control . ( those you new macro , focusing lens changes magnification factor . so one focuses object , object size viewfinder changes . this why i mention macro rails , they allow you achieve focus physically move lens/camera out reachieve desired composition . ) telephoto , due this lens ' superb image quality , it actually produces images much greater quality than 70-200mm f/ 2.8 . ( i know firsthand , i own it too ) difference 70-200mm versatility . if light drops too low , f/ 2.8 bests f/ 3.5 quite rapidly . if distance subjects change quickly or you unable move your feet frame images , 180mm too constricting zoom win . but under conditions where 180mm f/ 3.5 perform unhindered ( such airshow or out flower hunting ) , it consistantly produce brighter , more saturated , sharper images than 70-200mm f/ 2.8 . there complaint circulates slow speed which this lens autofocuses , expecially annoying when trying used telephoto . this actually incorrect . lens ' autofocus drive infact move very quickly , but it must traverse all way infinity 4 " front lens find subject . this where wait time comes into effect . here solution : utilizing af limiter switch allows you limit af search only infinity 5 ' front lens . consequently , this range 10% focus range ( other 90% 5 ' 4 " ) . i no longer experience af " hunting " problems when trying use 180mm telephoto . some other info this lens : front objective element actually concave . i think this only lens canon makes concave front element . it probablyexpensive replace if accident should occur , so utilize uv filter ( 72mm filter size ) . i recommend only b+w or hoya multi-coated brands . ( yes they're pricey , but worth it)the hood this lens actually little too small my opnion . if shooting backlit object , i sometimes get heavy orange glow viewfinder soi am forced use my hand " hood extender " block sunlight . its size , this lens relatively lightweight . it much lighter than 70-200mm f/ 2.8 easily handholdable extended periods time . this lens compatible canon extenders . i personally used it 1.4 extender . results excellent . while ca sharpness degrade noticeably 70-200mm , this lens shows barely difference image quality , except change designation 252mm f/5 , course . add fact macro capability now gone 1.0 1.4 , big bonus . so whom this lens apply ? -those who neither macro or telephoto prime who desire single piece handle both aspects excellent results . -those who plan performing professional product photography . -those looking into serious nature photography ( packing this lens wide-angle pretty much all you'll need day hike ) . what this lens not well : -low-light photography . -event photography . -landscapes . alternatives : -60mm/100mm : lesser image quality , less telephoto compression macro images , no real double-duty telephoto , but whole lot cheaper wider aperture . -mp-e 65mm : much greater magnification ( 5.0 ) , lower image quality , no telephoto capability , odd design means studio use almost exclusivel	1
canon lenses known their great optics priceyness . this fast tele excellent value . only thing would improve this lens would addition image stabilizion feature found few canon optics . course , advantage large aperature lenses you set fast shutter speed still enough light shot . this lens surprisingly compact , ( long focal length teles go ) . autofocus very fast quiet . comes hood , too .	1
this set basic filters must every camera bag ... even new slr users find them easy use they enhance your pictures - without doubt	1
if you intermediate level photography need camera bag strong comfortable this bag may you . i fit my canon s2is , adapter , two filters or lens this bag . this all i expected what i read this product . if you slr multiple lenses ,,, sorry ,,, you spend more bucks bigger bag .	1
i love bag all reasons others not like it . product listed gadget bag what it good . s2 large camera point shoot it fits very few bags . this bag fit camera easily space all types extras including batteries , chargers extra media cards . there also enough room small digital camera or film point shoot . correct way advertise this case would up two bodies or four small lens . given limitation , this great bag . bag very well made holds my canon powershot s2 very securely . i lay camera it back means even if i accidently power it lens opens harmlessly . material great waist belt very practical . strap well padded after day use i believe it one most comfortable straps i used . buy this bag correct camera you very happy it .	1
70-200 f/4 loved it pieces d60 , now 1d mkii , but sold 4.0 order pay 35-350 , which my work horse . due push pull feature however , 35-350 gets dusty quick good ol ' montana land , so it go cleanings every once while , f/stop isn't always desirable certain situations . 70-200 f/ 2.8 amazing . twist zoom little close camera , so it takes some twisting wrist get it where you need it , imho , bit too much turn 70 200 time one might need extreme sports . ( rodeo , nascar etc ) clarity this piece glass just blew me away . i comparison images my 70-200 f/4 when it new , 2.8 still visibly sharper . i put expensive filter it , my equipment asked lot very harmful conditions , i notice slightest big distortion filter , even though it good bw ..... so when i , i shoot lens no filter if i require extreme detail . 35-350l nowhere near quality this little 2.8 ... if it weren't difference distance , this lens would my one only . oh , i love . it my first lens , i treasure , but know i not buy distance lens without it	1
i read reviews this lens no one anything bad say it . it fast , crisp , focuses fast , quiet , solid bit heavy . weight vastly compensated all positive features . i used it my 20d just amazed . i just purchased 5d cannot believe my eyes . just great great lens	1
first thing make sure which lens you buying . kit lens comes canon 20d , 30d , 300d , or xt lower version , non usm one . higher version usm ones , you see red color " usm " front lens . according reviews , compare non usm ones , optically they same . however , usm motor focus faster much quieter . people complain build quality . actually i feel it really not bad , much better than canon 50mm 1.8 ii . usm auto focus performance fast , never hunt , much quieter than 50mm 1.8 ii . it fits nicely xt . not compare this hundred dollar lens other lenses cost three times or more . we compare apple apple . if you know limitations this lens use it wisely , images come out nicely . 1 . this not lens indoors low light conditions . if you need take lots indoor pictures flash not allowed , go get different lens . ( example , i use canon 50mm 1.4 this kind situation . ) 2 . distortion 18mm quite bit . avoid taking strait lines ( like buildings ) pictures edge while wide open . however , this easily corrected computers . 3 . step down aperture f8 or f11 , resolution improved lot even corners . overall , performance very good hundred dollar lens . it very light weight highly portable while traveling . this fits my needs cheap but fast good image quality walk around lens .	1
i chose purchase this lens over standard 18-55 comes kit xt . it functions smoothly seems worth difference definitely upgrade .	1
i purchased this lense novelty inexpensive 1.8 lense . i use this low light sport situations like basketball or volleyball - especially gymnastics where flash not allowed . i'm not huge fan locked into focal length , but anything under 2.8 you don't choice . this definitely not primary lense indoor sport shooting , but it fun companion when you need speed 1.8 indoors	1
i no investment dslr but narrowed my choices canon 30d nikon d200 . i always wanted nikon . d200 definitely joy hold it take good pictures ( i tried both camera store before i bought 30d ) . i lot research ( more than i care admit ! ) there no conclusive evidence one camera clear edge over other . depending your specific needs , one camera may " slightly better " than other . after trying out both cameras , i convinced 30d good fit my needs d200 . " value money " 30d clear winner over d200 ( i got mine when canon cash canon promotion going ) . also , beginner slr i found 30d its fully automatic scene modes easy start out . i don't expect use scene modes or full auto mode after week or two . i expect quickly graduate creative control zones . but use family camera , quick scene modes very helpful . if you expect use it more professional basis it'd probably not matter . additionally , when i checked it out store , i noticed canon 30d focused sharply almost every time . d200 not least few times . i'd take this grain salt though since it brief trial store . but i thought i'd share my experience . it may just anomaly actual equipment i tried out . i still find nikon d200 great camera ? absolutely ! i regret bought canon 30d ? absolutely not ! decision swinger my case really " money factor " . i more than willing spend up $300 more nikon d200 . but when difference became $550 it no longer became justifiable my christmas gift myself :-) my purchases included canon 30d [ ... ] , canon 17-85mm ef-s usm lens [ ... ] , sandisk extreme iii 2gb compact flash card [ ... ] i plan add external flash this soon , consider eventual lenses after i determine camera long-term keeper .	1
i am so pleased this camera ! there really nothing negative i think say it ! i also own cannon xt . i use both wedding photography well family portraits i am so impressed color quality d30 ! well cannon	1
those who truly know digital cameras , more than perhaps 8 megapixels important only if you plan blowing your images up " poster size " , or if you pro who knows how use all those pixels . truthfully , how many you really plan type stuff ? say rebel xti better than 30d because it " more megapixels " " smaller " not best advice . any canon dslr going give you great images , if know how use it . those you who trying decide which camera buy , you really need go camera store ask handle each camera . while you're it , ask yourself how it feels your hands . it too bulky ? it too small hard handle ? it features you want such spot metering , which rebel xti not ? 30d terrific dslr . it all features 99% us need . there reason why it costs more than rebel . 30d better camera overall .	1
excellent product works well . made canon ef28-135mm lense . reasonable price	1
i bought generic chinese " equivalent " bp-511 battery boasted higher milliamperage rating cheaper price than original canon battery came my camera . battery worked fine 3 months now only holds charge 20 minutes . i it fail critical times . never ever buy some knock-off chinese battery -- read reviews . chinese push out their crappy knock-offs unsuspecting consumers ( like i ) just make quick buck . also , don't trust glowing reviews generic sellers . they self-generated . my case , seller no longer selling under his original company name . he new name requisite ( sham ) glowing reviews . chinese products suck	1
some reason , canon- branded batteries better than those sold actual battery manufacturers . don't just look $$/mah ratio , consider safety , reliability longevity . these categories , canons rock . i bought g1 camera five years ago , camera toast , but battery still works like charm my 20d . others start out 1400 or even 1700 mah , but fail after six months - read reviews here amazon.com	1
i purchased this my new canon 30d dslr . i mainly use it fills outside sunny days , but it used light up situation . i'm personally still learning how best angle light get best outcome , but i don't think it'll take long	1
job canon e-ttl ii nice feature but i wish they would provide battery indicator like canon dslr cameras	1
excellent flash use my canon 20d fantastic price , canon 580ex expensive option , but should i buy one future ? 430ex perfect slave unit . great product canon always	1
this lens amazing . nothing escapes it . it like black hole . clearly best lens i ever owned . it like lidless eye sauron lord rings . it heavy requires rethinking how you hold camera . it comes beautiful case , hood , tripod mount lens . believe me you need it . i took few photos my son 250 feet away they look great . i now get work reading small manual . it 2 focal settings 2 stabilizing settings . wow !	1
i agree all others comments this lens . it works great but it big , heavy attracts attention . when i say it attracts attention , i am not kidding . i airshow taking pictures lot other amature photographers . my 100-400mm lens , however , attracted attention local newpaper reporter who interviewed me . however , i bought it use my 20d airshows i honestly say i am not disapointed . it well worth money . i also bought cheap kenko 1.5 teleconverter kicks . while converter isn't " " grade , i am pleased results autofocus still works which i understand not case canon tcs . those looking big zoom lens you want , you ulitimately going wind up buying this lens .	1
i shoot canon 20d used canon ef 75-300mm f/ 4.5 - 5.6 iii usm lens . i've always noticed limitations this lens when shooting amateur softball . i reviewed lens lineup canon website decided canon ef 100-400mm f/ 4.5 - 5.6 usm lens . even so , i apprehensive push/pull zoom system . since this lens seems so expensive , i wanted try it before i bought it . after renting lens using it over weekend softball tournament , i knew this right lens me . this serious lens meant serious photographers . lens , there lot more features manufactured better materials . construction sturdy consists 17 elements 14 groups . fluorite super ud-glass elements largely eliminate secondary spectrum . this lens compatible extenders 1.4 ii 2x ii . canon ef 100-400mm lens weighs 3 lbs/ 1,380 , accepts 77mm filters . sure get good quality uv haze filter . white , this lens looks bit strange , but helps keep it cool when using sun . some people concerned white , it attracts attention criminals . my experience , my 20d attracts attention regardless what lens i put it . i personally doubt thief looking something steal taking time evaluate cost item more concerned ease taking something they unload . i try make things difficult would thieves insurance back up . dual system two modes . mode 1 stationary subjects while mode two moving subjects . it recommended function not used tripod ; however i used it my monopod success . helps eliminate camera shake helps stabilize lens when shooting moving vehicle . while there limitations what , it give you couple extra stops . just keep mind , attempts eliminate camera movement , not movement subject photographed . this lens permits auto or manual focus depending how switch set . there also switch shift 1.8 m/ 5.9 ft infinity or 6.5 m/ 21.3 ft infinity . zooming this lens takes little time get used if you never used it before . once it gotten used , it seems much faster than typical twist zooming . resistance ring used tighten or loosen resistance zooming . this allows practically locking zoom place or providing no resistance all . zooming simple pulling or pushing lens its name sugges t.t he push/pull system causes air noticeably pushed around . because air pushed into camera , there myth lens causes dust settle accumulate digital camera sensors . i mostly use this lens one dirtiest environments i shoot amateur softball pictures . even so , my experience not support myth . i not seen any evidence support myth any reputable source either . included this lens tripod mount , lens hood , storage case . tripod mount best option use when mounting tripod . this helps balance load . mounting camera instead creates unbalanced set up may topple over . case zippered soft case ( lz1234 ) also purchased separately . lens hood ( et-83c ) used reduce lens flare protect front element certain situations . canon ef 100-400mm such awesome lens , it almost fails compare canon ef 75-300mm . clarity sharpness incredible . auto-focus quiet quick . features add creative versatility . canon ef 100-400mm comes price , but it worth every bit it . now i both lenses , canon ef 75-300mm no longer used . pros : incredible clarity sharpness quiet quick auto-focus features add creative versatility dual system cons : heavy bulky ( this should expected these types lenses	1
i purchased lowepro slingshot 200 replace tamrac adventure 7 backpack i recently returned amazon . i spent quite few hours researching bags use sightseeing/hiking initially purchased tamrac bag b/c its similarity ( style ) regular backpack . recent " series " purchase encouraged me keep low profile when transporting my gear . while tamrac bag certainly looked part , its functionality left something desired . adventure 7 held my entire kit , which includes : canon digital rebel xt , ef24-105mm " " , ef50mm ef18-55mm " kit " lenses , ex580 flashgun various hoods/filter/etc above lenses . now bad part , once strapped into its normal position , only way access your gear ( adven . 7 pack ) fully remove backpack , place it ground , unzip zipper fully , then remove/replace camera/gear you desire . this proved very cumbersome while rocky terrain " great falls " national park va ( near dc ) , fact , there times when i gave up few nice photo opportunities simply b/c getting camera would too difficult . i own lowepro holster , but going route , i would limited my ability bring alternate lenses/accessories . after some additional research , i decided try slingshot 200 . let compare tow some key points : gear capacity : nearly identical both bagsadditional capacity : tamrac trumps lowepro , it nearly double useable storage capacity , great bringing snack , your keys , etc . styling : again , tamrac winner , looks like standard backpack , versus strange look slingshotfunctionality : backpack , tamrac much more comfortable , greater storage capacity even offers waist support strap longer trips . but , this comes cost accessibility . lowepro slides easily around front . simply unzip your camera right there . it also stable platform lens changing/cleaning/etc . summarize : hiking/walking/etc where you need instant access your camera accessories , lowepro slingshot 200 wins hands down . pros : instant access your gear , includes all-weather cover ( attached ) , nice attention details ( lens cleaning/protection cloth particularly nice touch ) , etc . cons : strange styling , not reversible ( only worn right shoulder ) , nearly impossible carry hanging one shoulder .	1
if you believer protecting your expensive lens purchase filter than you lot worse than tiffen filter . glass quality good price reasonalbe . filter cuts down glare adversly effect some shots out uv filter advertised . not much else say .	1
uv filter standard filters get . tiffen makes good quality filter this just expected . price equilivant other vendors expected i no problems ; ordering simple product came time	1
after using both lenses i think this much better . here my reasons : 1- 2.8 makes autofocus much faster accurate . 2- bokeh much better this one . 3- macro slightly better this one . 4- 105 mm make very little difference image size . 5- not very crucial 24-50 range .	1
you buying quality not price . im amazed quality pictures i get my new lens . it seems i changed my camera new model ... totaly diferent pictures . i compared my previous cameras lenses wow ... i cant believe i thought i some great pictures my collection . i dont want use my other lenses anymore , i new standard my pictures . i say it " crazy " decision buy this lens because price , but this investment once you it you enjoy last many years . if you love photography really like go full detail you wont regret it	1
this terrific lens , my new favorite . excellent feature ; i wish all my lenses it . even 2x teleconverter , it rock steady viewing shooting . my images sharp tack great contrast color . i'd pay three times this much get any better telephoto images	1
after debating this 70-200 series i decided purchase this lens . i pleasantly surprised results . i also own 17-85 50mm 1.8 lenses i found i gotten " most pleasing " results this lens . pictures very sharp my 20d - even 200mm - 300mm range . i've also happy quality bokeh . primary drawback i see af tends hunt fair amount when confronted low contrast images . said , i used it some flying bird shooting wildlife refuge surprised see how many shots sharp focus . however , it little bit all or nothing . several shots also wildly out focus . since lens fairly slow focus , you never know what you're gonna get such fast moving object against distant sky . i much more consistent results when shooting soccer , softball football park . af speed not present issue any these activities results excellent . i wish lens little less expensive but i prints i gotten my 13 19 printer worth extra money	1
1.4 ii teleconverter modest update canon earlier 1.4 tc . mark ii allows this extender stacked canon extenders ( either 1.4 ii or 2x ii ) without separate two extension tube ( although loss sharpness stacking extenders may not acceptable you ) . otherwise , quality newer 1.4 ii supposed very similar older model , which i've never owned . 1.4 ii great way extend reach compatible lenses . note not every canon lens compatible this extender . following canon web site : " this tele extender used fixed focal length lenses 135mm longer ( except 135mm f/ 2.8 softfocus lens ) , ef 70-200 f/ 2.8 , 70-200 f/ 2.8 , 70-200 f/ 4.0 , 100-400 f/ 4.5 - 5.6 zoom lenses . " i use it frequently my canon 70-200mm f/ 2.8 , which turns it into 98-280mm zoom . extra reach it adds not tremendous , but it very welcome when i just need little more than what lens alone give me . i've found no appreciable loss sharpness using 1.4 . course , any extender going reduce sharpness some degree , but normal examination , i can't distinguish photos taken 70-200mm use 1.4 those don't . fact 70-200mm f/ 2.8 very sharp lens begin helps this department . using 1.4 decreases your lens ' widest aperture ' capability ' one stop . some lenses , more significant than it appears surface ; when using non-pro canon body ( such my 20d ) lens must minimum wide-open aperture ' capability ' f/ 5.6 autofocus work . lens doesn't set f/ 5.6 , it just ' capable ' least f/ 5.6 after adjusting one stop loss 1.4 . means some camera/lens combinations , adding 1.4 force you focus all your shots manually . ( note : there known ' fix ' this restores autofocus . i've never needed try it , but it involves taping over some connector pins 1.4 fool camera body . proceed caution if you try this , google search learn how it right before attempting it . ) 1.4 also reduces focus speed very slightly . i've only used it my 70-200mm , which canon usm fast-focusing lens begin , but decrease speed so slight i really don't notice it . it not affect ( image stabilization ) all . 1.4 built quality canon l-series lenses , which means it weather sealed keep canon pro body l-series lens weather sealed when used them . if you're considering this extender , you're probably also considering canon 2x ii teleconverter . i not own 2x but lot research it before ultimately deciding go 1.4 . 2x decreases your aperture two stops , reported noticable decrease sharpness -- more than some photographers willing live . other hand , i've never read review complained loss sharpness 1.4 . if you've already invested lot money telephoto lenses , 1.4 ii relatively inexpensive way get even more reach ( value ) out your investment while adding only modest amount bulk your camera bag . highly recommended	1
i am just hobbyist . this big purchase big step me get into this level camera . i still haven't mastered using it yet , i've it few months . it wonderful job taking pictures . if you right lenses , it take some most beautiful pictures you've ever seen . again , i'm just hobbyist/enthusiast . i use it take pictures work , too . i highly recommend getting couple very good lenses go it . don't go cheap lenses canon , tamron , sigma , etc . make this camera . yourself favor get nice zoom - spend some bucks . you'll happy you . camera itself pretty easy use if you leave it auto , but that like buying race car never shifting out first gear . auto settings great , they wonderful job , but you so much more if you learn use camera manual , av , tv , or mode . it allows you so much more creativity you'll amazed difference . 30d came out right before i bought 20d , i would probably buy it price now , but i'm very happy my 20d	1
this camera amazing , i couldn't asked more . just warned manual pretty terrible . it best just play around camera until you figure it out , rather than wasting time trying decipher manual	1
i initially bought this switch able take fireworks pictures my 30d tripod . it worked well this application . got some great shots fireworks . since used it some wildlife photos it works well this application also . cord camera switch only two feet long . sufficient use tripod , but perhaps just little short any other application switch . i consider it " overpriced " what it , but if you need manually operated remote switch , it performs this function well . release button option where you lock-it " " . it useful if you what leave your camera shutter open long exposure . i didn't research any other brands remote switches my canon 30d . there may others , but i hurry something before 4th july , just ordered it , since i knew suppose work my camera . it performs it intended design function . it overpriced , my estimation , but if you need one , this one perform job .	1
it simple , handy works well prevent shaking your camera . but i am still doubt if this simple accessory really deserves 50 bucks ... this wired release would choice only if you not digital rebel user who more reasonable price option additional shutter button .	1
i lens , i cap .... its so long since i bought both i don't remember if cap came lens or not . surely it !!!!!!! i love my add lenses but i say now i've added all these other toys ( macro , wide angle , telephoto , filters ) i now realize i shouldve gotten slr digital held out true lenses instead conversion option . i love my s2is but just think how nice real camera would !!!!!! sigh ...	1
i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1

i canon zr700 camera , it comes one this batteries . since it just giving me little more than hour recording , i felt i needed extra battery . when i saw options , because high price this product , i felt tempted buy oem battery that cost 16.00 usd shipping it good reviews other customers . but them i found canon bp-2l14 here amazon , which gives twice power only 56.00 usd , just 13.00 usd double power original product ( double size too , only bad thing it , but it really not much )	1
i bought this camera two years ago , pictures always perfect , even though sixth month it started getting stains everywhere , but then i found out it normal , not good but it usually happens this cameras . but worst all tha fact it displays error 18 ( e18 ) , lens gets stock camera won't work all . i searched google it , because user guide says nothing this error , then i read many reviews said there nothing it many canon cameras same defect ... i am really mad dissapointed canon , i never buy camera this brand , i wouldn't recommend it , unless you willing buy camera 2 years or less then throw your money trash	-1
i just finished semester brisbane , australia . i must say , retrospect , best thing i took me this trip this camera . she champ , definitely adventurous camera . thing cute hell yet solid like rock . i cannot remember amount times i dropped it sand , no negative consequences whatsoever . i even dipped it ocean mistake once ( not encouraged ) thing still works like charm . it also features like sepia weird flash makes lights something funny , making pictures wicked cool . outer covering shown wear , but it only helps acknowledge this camera take rough handling . people even comment this positive light , it become part my travelling gear . it also great scenic shots , panorama option . retrospect , it amazing buy , so affordable ( i'm backpackers ' budget) ! only because i seen amazing skies breathtaking scenery would i consider upgrading camera better pixelage . but if you staying hole-in-the-wall hostels or sleeping beach , you don't want expensive camera you . this thing great . battery life also great ( sake topping off cake )	1

i love this monopod ! i'm person who uses my camera nearly every day ( canon eos elan 7 35mm ) . this item one my favorite accessories camera -- so much easier travel than tripod ! it sturdy , but lightweight , easy use very portable . i am mostly using monopod support my camera enormous , extremely heavy 500mm telephoto lens attached . i'm actually able hold huge lens steady just monopod -- not one blurry photo ! i've dragged it all over bluegrass kentucky ... across fields horse farms , even racetrack . i've taken it out into wilderness photograph elk . i keep closing it down extending it out every time we got out vehicle , which often . also recently traveled all over arizona it grand canyon , monument valley , canyon de chelley , etc . i constantly opening closing it , taking literally hundreds photos ( 14 rolls ) no problems all . i'm wondering if other reviewer just got defective one . i wish i'd bought one these years ago ! i highly recommend it	1
i don't personally subscribe notion big brand manufacturers always make best lenses out there , but this one instance where they really , honestly . this thing lightning fast , sharp tack , bokeh much better than sigma equivalent , you'll hard time finding use your raw processor chromatic aberration correcting sliders when coupled digital body ( you still get some purple fringing around backlit subjects , but genuine ca bad enough show up print so far proven non-existent me any focal length or aperture ) . weight serious downside , but it one i live . if you're nature photographer who really problem holding still or if you plan using extension tubes , version might worth extra $700 you , but if you're doing event photography where subjects ones jumping around like rabbits , save your money your battery power ; ain't thing wrong this lesser model	1
i mainly use this when taking landscape shots where i want either make clouds pop or liven sky up some ( remember it works best 90 degrees sun . ) i also put it when shooting highly reflective vegetation or waterscapes would otherwise cause blown-out highlights . one other little secrete use this when shooting waterfalls since it allow you shoot slower shutter speeds thus increasing wispy waterfall look	1
it gave me option change angle light ... this nice option i am sure	1
first off this very nice lens money . i mine now three months love it . it great walk around lens 28-135 just right most pictures kids landscape pictures . it fast focus sharp clear pictures clear up 125 range gets little soft 135 but easily fixed little post editing . i taken most my pictures hand held works great . i even recommended it friend . i am using it 30d it spends most its time there . i am not sorry i purchased this lens taking lot more pictures it future .	1
this great ' only lens ' day . good weight vs capability handing most photo opportunities you'll come across . good price versatility function provides	1
this cheap lens - old design , very plastic - prove terribly useful those budget who want wider perspective , especially 1.6 crop factor dslrs . i learned " cheap " this lens - broke focus ring day after delivery . but i blame myself too , replacement given me no trouble , though i think my first one bit sharper than second . many standards , this lens match or exceed zoom lens comparable price ( prime lens should ) . autofocus little buzzy , but main time you'll notice when it loses its bearing suddenly lurches way off target . mostly , focuses quickly enough well . some chromatic aberration worst-case scenarios , but nothing awful or unexpected . vignetting , even 1.6 crop , noticeable , mainly sky shots , but gradual rather than sudden . ( might unacceptably worse full-frame camera . ) undue distortion seems minimal - haven't really checked but also haven't really noticed , if you see what i mean . flare seems average , perhaps better than one would expect such wide glass . bokeh nonchalant , not dreamy but never intrusive . but price , positives make up negative " average " tendencies . it vibrantly colorful contrasty almost fault . hard light little more challenging this lens , little more tricky balance exposure highlights shadows . it softish wide-open , but very unobjectionably - yet regret shooting f/ 2.8 . my main lens 50mm f/ 1.4 , switching back forth same aperture setting perfectly functional practice . lose little crisp taking four times much space , that trade-off i run . ( their filter threads match too . ) f/4 higher , i get " plenty sharp , " though i've never seen " unreal sharp " this glass ( i 50mm ) . " crop factor " over-simplifies effect mounting wide-angle lens 1.6 camera . yes , field view match 40mm full-frame , but perspective not , because you'll closer your subjects . shooting live subjects ( like bands , models , or street life ) require learning curve , so beware mission critical work before you've broken yourself so you anticipate its exagerations . said , i bought this lens primarily " head-to-toe " model shooting my modest studio , it real asset . interestingly , it tends toward very useful " slimming effect " makes hippy girls look more slender shorter girls more ambiguous height ( least " head-to-toe " distance them ) . disconcerting first but terribly useful once you've gotten hang it . ( beware chicken legs or reverse dramatic perspectives . ) i read every review i could find before purchase , this lens seemed magic middle higher cost clarity 20mm cheaper lesser sharpness 28mm . near i tell , i nailed it . this not spectacular lens , but very very functional one if you need affordable wider angle generally won't let you down	1

this camera looks amazing , not i ever money it . i am impressed this camera choice shoot feature film ! it used shoot tim burton corpse bride	1
i cannot say enough this camera ! moment you pick up box , you know you quality . construction materials used top notched . contents box found elsewhere , so i won't bother details . charging battery full takes 2hrs . if you memory battery repeated charges without complete depletion , you recondition battery included charger . it just takes 8hrs . while many lament fact no li-ion battery included , canon seems anticipated needs professionals field . one also option plugged into ac outlet not dependent batteries . reading manual takes bit time . camera endless customizable functions which overwhelming times . not it should deter you , but one rarely need all those functions anyway . using camera not seem too difficult . many functions need use two buttons , which may take some getting used . navigating through menu confusing initally , but improved time goes . autofocus speed responsive sharp . shooting high iso ( #62 ; 1000 ) minimal noise . looking some my pictures taken 1 fluorescent light room iso 1600 , appeared if flash used . photos my black lab incredible considering ambient light high iso . camera always ready go . if you manipulating within depths menu heirarchy , want suddenly take shot , just press shutter button , compose , focus , shoot . its quick responsive . incredible ...! some may wondering sizes pictures . jpeg 4 sizes range 1 - 2.8 mb ; raw files 8.4 mb . one take average 800 - 1200 shots full battery charge -- assuming one capacity hold it . prints my i9900 outstanding . cost pretty penny then some . also consider amazon authorized canon reseller . many rebates require you purchase authorized reseller eligible rebates . also , some internet deals camera not authorized resellers . overall , very impressive camera . cost many may prohibitive many . eos 20d may more cost effective alternative , but i not regret my decision one bit	1
this uv filter it job protect lens well . build solid ( metal construction ) . glass also descent quality . performance , it absorbs some uv light . uv light absorbtion hardly noticeable , probably sky 1-a haze filter version absorb more uv light than this lens which fine me . now , one problem which internal reflection . i've heard many people say it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out it not caused directly low light/night situation . internal reflection appear when there strong/bright source light comparison overall exposure ( surrounding environment ) . put it example ( which hopefully easier understand ) , when you take picture lamp during nightime light much brighter than surrounding area then you see internal reflection . you move position light closer sides/corner picture ( not center picture ) , internal reflection reduces finally dissapear ( if you move light far enough center ) . if light isn't too bright/contrast compare surrounding environment then there no internal reflection . but course most time , lamp nightime often very bright . but point i'm trying make internal reflection doesn't happen all time during low light or night time . additionally , internal reflection isn't only happening night . it also happen afternoon if you taking picture sun example . basically same rule above , how bright light source compared surrounding area , you move sun center photo near side internal reflection move side/dissapear ( also depending angle ) . but best way just remove filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you reduce occurence internal reflection identifying correctly when internal reflection occur then remove filter during those situation ( which not hard ) . i'm actually not fan lens filter ( any filter ) i think it only degrade picture quality we added layer sensor object , but i decided use them anyway all my lens . i would recommend everyone get one this filter if you don't any filter your lens yet .	1
i'm very happy product would recommend it my friends . your service also excellent	1

i am not professional photographer , but i wanted high quality lenses go my canon 10d ( which i may upgrade soon ) . i researched over month before purchasing this lens , i not disappointed . i only wanted carry around two lenses , so i purchased this one , canon-ef 17-40mm f/4l usm ultrawide zoom lens . i found this combination works very well me . my uses include photographing landscapes , wildlife , sports events , my family . speed quietness autofocus outstanding , zoom doesn't compromise quality prints . even though price high , you really get what you pay lenses .	1
this great lens . i not want repeat all good things other reviewers written this lens . it not so heavy so i use tripod without using tripod collar ( costs 119.99 ) . this best value i ever got lens . now i can't wait get 17-40mm f4l too . you get very nice bokeh when wide open f4 5.6 , course depending how far background subject . people complain how ugly hood looks but subjective . i like it because it works great you attach it reversed position lens so it fit your camera bag . i think fit finish lens beautiful	1
what difference , after using " standart " ef-s 18-55 kit lens came my rebel xt now this lens i finally see this really excelent camera but only if you use it excellent lens like this 70-200 f4 . great sharpness , color , solidly buit , obviously heavy but taking outdoors photos this one among best best	1
lens great ! i'm using it my eos 20d , shots beautiful . wide open setting ( 1.4 ) , depth field amazing provides absolutely outstanding boquet . this lens definitely worth difference price over 1.8 . boquet much better . little advice : avoid using auto focus your camera when using this lens ... its too easy catch any little thing front or behind what you intending focus , you see difference , just small difference depth . manually , lens provide you perfect shots every time ! its well worth extra few seconds make sure shot composed correctly	1
i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
my take this lens it " " quality optic fine , non " " package . there nothing else market compete it ( nothing all ) , it produces supurb images . it isn't f/ 2.8 lens , but it close enough most uses . competition tamron full stop slower , not sharp , awful dim light compared canon 10-22 lens ( sorry , tamron fans , but tamron lens isn't even playing same ballpark ) . i use this lens 30d body , i always keep it hand if i'm doing any indoor , or tight group photography . it perfect solution perennial problem not enough room capture all kids birthday party one shot because your back up against wall . this lens just get your toes into picture widest setting , yet delivers tack sharp , colorful , contrasty images . auto focus spot , silent , fast . it must lens active amateur , or any pro using 1.6 crop factor camera . you simply can't beat this lens anything available market today . beng said , not try convince yourself this make good " walkaround " lens . it isn't . even max length , it far too short live your camera standard lens . you need this lens , even if you don't know it yet , but it should not your first lens , it only used 15 20 percent time . those times , it performance simply cannot equaled any other zoom lens 1.6 crop factor camera . you amazed quality this lens . it rivals performance modern prime lenses , presents bright viewfinder image , delivers goods tight situations . this not casual assessment , nor canon " feel good " moment my part . i developed my first bw contact prints 1964 , my own darkroom age 9 ( my parents concerned :)) , avid photographer ever since . small , medium , large format cameras lenses passed through my hands over years , canon become my favorite small format brand . still , canon builds some trash lenses should avoided . 10-22 usm not one them :) . before you go out buy this lens , you should already own ef-s 17-55mm f/ 2.8 lens . king 1.6 crop factor standard lenses , includes awesome canon feature . it end up mounted your camera 80% time , keep you smiling after every shoot . get lens first . then , get 10-22mm lens . then , let your imagination run wild , plan serious telephoto lenses future . trust me or not , two lenses mentioned above provide you photographic tools astound you . get them your kit soon you afford them . little warning either lens .... some here argue point , but either lens , get good quality uv filter multi-coated both sides , built extra thin avoid vignetting wide lens settings . good filter cost little less than one hundred dollars , cost up one hundred forty dollars . minimum brand would hoya pro 1 multi coated filters , ante goes up there . everything else garbage , including canon " sharp cut " filter costs less than fifty bucks . no kidding , no conjecture . if you use cheap filters , you never see what your lens really . ever . no doubt many respond claims their twenty dollar filter works just fine , but they simply don't know any better , never used their expensive equipment it full potential . it akin chevy owner passing judgement mercedes benz . chevy might feel real good , but until you own mercedes , you just no clue . bottom line .... make sure quality your filters exceed quality your lenses . yes , hundred bucks pop 77mm filter , it hurts , but you never regret it . also , amazon not stock lens hoods all non canon lenses . price stupid high those hoods , but they make night day difference picture quality . whenever you order non canon lens , find web seller who hood stock , get it right now . again , you never regret owning i t.t hat it my review/rant . buy this lens . buy 17-55 f/2 , 8 first . buy lens hoods both . toss any " kit " lenses came camera trash bin ( where they belong ) , very happy .	1
canon ef-s 10-22mm f/ 3.5 - 4.5 usm slr lens canon ef-s slrs ( like 20d 30d ) good all round lens though it soft 10mm . it only works ef-s compatable cameras which presently 1.6 multipliers so lens effectively 16mm 35mm . if you need shoot cramped spaces , or you shoot lots interiors you need wide angle , ef-s slr this lens required equipment	1
it very sharp lens . you wised use it extensively little children , they such clear faces . careful when you use this lens middle age women . it could show imperfecton thousand fold . again very sharp , very fast af focusing my nikon f80 . ecxelent portrature lens , but careful-women hate you unflattering portrature . my advise use black white film-you see less imperfection prints same rasor sharp focus	1
could not any simpler use . used it few times since it arrived it works flawlessly . +++ recommended all users . quicker easier than built charger zr700 camcorder	1
i really like this lens but my results not consistent . i think though this more function my limited skill photography . focal range seems very narrow but when you hit it results outstanding . i occasionally get images out focus but again i think this my fault . i bought this macro work but i use it prime lens most time	1
i never thought $250 lens could so good . i trying buy lenses light-weight my 20d , due neck injury problem , this 50mm fits bill . great low light , agree also , bokeh sweet . i alot bee chasing manage some great macros bees flight this one . all hand held . also take great indoor shots without flash , steady hand . i chose it also because it one least expensive high rated canon 50mm . it goes well inexpensive canon lens , 55-200mm ef 4.5 - 5.6 ii , which also well outdoors , including macro . i am very pleased both , wouldn't part them	1

hoods offer several benefits photographer . primarily hood shades lens stray light may result unwanted discoloration or hazing image , or appearance lens flare . shading your lens helps improve contrast image quality . hood not required eliminate these problems , any item used shade lens provide same protection stray light . hood convenient it built offer protection while ensuring it not inadvertently find its way into your image . photographers often state protective abilities hood reason one . this hood solid petal shaped one three quarters inch long offers limited protection keeping moisture wind blown debris off lens element . when place , hood protect lens impacting solid objects . so shallow petal shaped , even this type protection limited . even if protection limited , replacing damaged hood usually cheaper than repairing expensive lens . this hood manufactured canon 24-105mm f/ 4.0 ef normally comes included lens when sold new . there no need buy one amazon often suggests . since hood wider than lens ; it easily stored attached reverse position . this doesn't add length lens , but make it wider inch . inch may not seem like lot , but tightly packed camera bag , it huge . this lens isn't unusually wide so extra inch may not problem . while protective benefits exist , they secondary limited . i find impact hood my image quality more convincing reason use hood . considering impact image quality low cost compared my other camera equipment ( except lens case ) , purchasing hood money well spent . pros : improves contrast image qualityreduces lens flare problemsoffers limited protection lens cons : takes up more space your camera bag store lenshigh price molded piece plasti	1
i surprised heft this tele converter when it arrived . it comes pullstring pouch offers reasonable protection camera bag , purse , or other similar carying case hold lens while attached required adapter . it also comes lens cap each end . converter high quality look feel throughout , lens hood included inexpensive adapter kit ( required ) , mounting threads cut accurately enough lettering lens hood all line up perfectly top assembly . it looks i would expect canon , which say , instrument quality . ok , looks don't make good pictures , so here rest story . body made tough , lightweight materials ( frp ?, polycarbonate ? ) , so what you feel when you take lens out case weight several glass elements . glass coating well , pictures nice contrasty . flare distortion minimal , par quality slr offering . base lens s2 fairly fast , doesn't suffer defects maximum telephoto , so this converter built complement quality , it fine job . matter fact , converter lens optimized supplement only telephoto portion main camera lens range , less than moderate telephoto settings , you end up view back end converter lens , not much else . used intended , it gives you ability use your 5 mp sensor take spectacular 650 mm telephoto shots incredible sharpness , color , detail . there no comparison digital zoom all . this lens alows you " reach out touch someone " while using every pixel your sensor available , without adding eyeball noticable distortion all . top , image stabilizer camera lets you shoot 650 mm telephoto pictures handheld reasonable lighting conditions . check out price 600 mm image stabilized lens slr get back me after you recover . sure , $ 5,000 slr body/lens combo win comparison lab bench , might stop faster ( only high end though ) , but s2/teleconverter combo lets you take far better more creative pics than classic 35 mm mirror tele lens ever offer . further cropping photos your computer later simply amaze you . price , it must item . it also catches action field movie mode nosebleed seats stadium . it big lens , make your s2 look though it must slr , but combination s2 teleconverter light enough ( compared slr ) carry all day long desert without problem . it offers digicam prosumer quality glass reach used reserved higher end slr . what it adds your photographic range , it cheap , o.o ne suggestion . lens adapter/lens hood combo you need mount any three converter lenses canon offers dirt cheap . combo sells around 26 bucks everywhere . adapter attaches camera push button release bayonet mount , quick change , feels very secure . adapter also takes 58 mm filters all kinds , i like keep uv filter mounted my camera improvement contrast it offers , protect camera lens damage ( i dropped my s2 this past weekend , hoya uv filter took fall . it dented , but didn't break ) . anyway , because they so cheap , i suggest getting one s2 , each converter lens you buy . way , you switch lenses instant , keep front each lens protected it own uv filter and/or hood . oh yes . good circular polorizer filter really kills glare , brings out contrast any lens under many typical shooting conditions . tele-converter lens not front threads mount filters ( most don't ) , but i made adapter mounting 72 mm uv filter 7/16 " long cardboard masking tape core inside diamerter slipped snugly over end tele-converter . prior gluing uv filter tube section , i painted tube flat black . now , circular polorizer ( or any other 72 mm filter attaches adapter , looks like it belongs there , works perfectly . i think you enjoy this converter much i . good shooting .	1
it easy attach -- detach -- works well most ( but not all ) my 58mm lens . it cut down glare , let face it , hood makes your lens look bit more dynamic , while also protecting it elements	1

i purchased this speedlight my d70s . it easy take out box fire up . but it capable lot more than your standard portraiture vacation shots . i using this unit in-store photography it worked wonders . included filters help balance out horrific fluorescent lighting found most stores . while it highly intuitive , i also control it outpu t.t his essential part any nikon package	1
here my point . when you buy digital slr , most likely couple years there newer model available some better features same price . but lenses well flashes not changing fast keep value much longer . so purely financial prospective , it always better invest more long lasting lenses flashes less dslr body . point . most people don't need all advanced feature modern flashes probably easily survive without them . but also almost everyone sooner or later finds him/herself situation , when place just too dark too big . so it more likely you'll need just more raw power then any advanced features . so bottom line , since general purpose flash usually long term investment , if you choice , try get most powerful one	1
i say , semi-pro photographer , this one item made vast difference many my shots . it allowed me get studio like shots ( extent ) without use those giant studio flashes cost thousands dollars . i able just set up few hot lights use sb-800 off camera thanks amazingly wonderfull wireless feature got great quality shots what i needed . also , concert photographer , low light areas this works great especially since most tour managers don't take highly flash use , it allows me farther back get great shot since i know little more fill light work . sb-800 i say far one few products you won't regret paying high price . i originally thought getting 600 decided go all out get 800 after reading all featuers it sb-600 doesnt . this product , coupled my d70 dr-6 right angle viewfinder ( great investment you should all look into ) give me so many great shots , i say only design flaw sb-800 i can't use dr-6 while flash camera unless i buy bracketing system . most time though , when i am useing dr-6 i am angle where pop-up works just fine but there few times i wish i could use 800 well . so those who unsure this sb-600 , go this product . now all i find better lens then my sigma 28-300 i am all set . anyone know where find good deal 18-200mm nikor lens ? if so someone ( if there way ) please email or contact me i myspace search my companyhope this helps least one personbradpremier image	1

i get frustrated all negative reviews this lens gets web . yes , af slow first generation . yes , it not totally sharp it slow long end . but what other $440 ( inc shipping ) 300mm lenses there ? * costs $1100 shorter but heavier optics not much better . * 100-400l costs $1400 , much larger just slow . * 70-200/4l 50% more expensive , only 200mm lacks . * new 70-300 replaces this lens probably better lens than this version but it costs 50% more currently ( oct 05 ) still not available us . 75-300mm my zoo lens so i don't use it nearly much my standard zoom everyday photography . my digital rebel its 1.6 crop factor this lens equivalent 120-480mm 35mm terms , image stabilization feature it makes some exotic optics . play this lens ' strengths ( middle aperture range [ don't afraid higher iso settings achieve this ] not extreme long end ) your images able printed 8x10 without issue . you're not going able easily track speeding cheetah this lens but not what this lens . it also unfair compare this lens series alternatives - if you afford series lenses then use them but don't cut those us down without your disposable income just enjoying this lens . if you own this lens you want improve quality your images remember always use lens hood . also , amazing but there limits ; monopod improve image sharpness no end . but both these tips apply equally most lenses both cheaper more expensive . this lens earned permanent place my camera bag . it cheap enough light enough carry just case you might need strong telephoto . really works really useful telephoto this kind zoom range . don't put off or intimidated lens snobs line counters . this lens also holds its value well ; buy it , use it , now while you're saving your dream telephoto you able sell it not much less than you paid it when time comes upgrade . when time comes you just might decide you want keep 75-300mm around well . this lens great value very useable even if it not great lens .	1
anyone considering this lens , according canon site , there newer model supersede this one which out perform it . item # 0345b002 70-300mm f/4- 5.6 usm lens available sometime 9/05	1
best camera i've ever owned . it features found larger slr such shutter speed red-eye reduction . several shoot modes such portrait allows close ups well scenery mode which allows sharp vivid photos foilage well sunsets . marvelous little camera size slightly bigger than pack cigarettes allows you take this anywhere without bulk some slr their required lens . too many features list here . try one yourself you'll amazed	1
pure image quality standpoint , this lens not please pixel peepers . wide end zoom , which i personally use more often than telephoto end , this lens not very sharp , it suffers fairly bad distortion . worse than , me , chromatic abberations ; this lens quite prone significant ca when shot wide end , which look lot worse than little bit distortion or softness . given price this lens , one should expect higher level optical performance . maximum aperture this lens not very large , f/4 wide end , f/ 5.6 telephoto end . image stabilization makes up this some , you comfortably shoot much slower shutter speeds than otherwise , but , let honest here ; this lens poor performer if you want shoot low light no tripod . small aperture makes dark viewfinder , which very big problem if you trying compose picture dark ( using tripod ) . yet , i still gave this very imperfect lens four stars , this not without reason . first all , focal length range quite handy . it isn't mega-zoom everything , however , it covers most often used focal length ranges , appropriate lens use vast majority situations . little bit extra zoom telephoto end handy occasion , it also worth noting lens sharpens up quite bit when you zoom some - it might soft wide end , but zoomed , it quite good . i printed large 20x30 " using this lens digital rebel , no qualms results . yes , there sharper lenses out there , but you lot more likely see difference sharpness your computer monitor than prin t.t his lens ring usm , which enables it focus very quietly , very quickly , whereas slightly cheaper ( 2.8 ) options 3rd parties normal focusing motors slow noisy comparison . if you want use this lens indoors , you best off getting flash go it , such 430ex . lens usable fantastic indoor lighting , or during day , but won't give you good results low light no flash . if you shooting lower light situations ( people particular ) , tamron sigma some good options 17-50mm range 2.8 apertures , i would recommend those lenses over this one . if you'd prefer extra telephoto range , image stabilization so you shoot smaller aperture poorer lighting situations greater depth field ( instead needing shoot landscape f/4 , instance , without image stabilization , you could use f/11 this lens , get sharp picture better depth field . this even more useful close focus range - while this isn't true macro lens , if you take closeup photos without tripod , you want stop lens down greater depth field , helps quite bit . overall , i've fairly pleased performance this lens . if you like worry splitting hairs , zooming all way pictures your computer , this lens likely dissapoint you . if , however , you willing sacrifice optical perfection get very well rounded , useful lens , then i'd recommend it , however , would also recommend you consider 3rd party options , they also great lenses , offer somewhat better value	1
if you only going buy one lens your 10 , 20 or 30d then buy this lens . i haven't seen better general purpose lens out there . ef-s 17-85mm takes great photos , especially action oriented situation where you need run around lot get variety different shots different distances . some complained lens overpriced . i agree price , it would nice get hood carry bag thrown , but i say canon impeccable warranty service . i got sand inside my lens autofocus quit while i shooting photos military helicopters landing iraq . i got lens repaired shipped back me within 30 days - baghdad middle war . i able speak human tech fairly easily they even replaced something i clearly broke through heavy use wasn't covered under warranty . repaired lens works perfectly . if you're looking reasonable alternative budget try this lens : sigma zoom super wide angle af 17-70mm f/ 2.8 - 4.5 dc macro autofocus lens canon digital slr camerasbear mind if you issues you're using non-canon lenses canon body , support you get canon limited	1
i purchased this tripod 47th street photo through amazon.com . tripod appeared arrive good shape , except operating instructions not included . i immediately emailed 47th stree photo customer service address printed flyer they included my shipment . i asked them if they would able send me copy operating instructions . they not respond my email , so few days later i emailed them again . once again , no response . i then emailed amazon.com, informed them missing instructions non-responses 47th street photo . no response amazon either ! far tripod goes , it appears very good value money . i gave it 4 rather than 5 stars because , due missing operating instructions , i cannot certain i properly checked out all its features . however , i am certain both 47th street photo amazon.com rate zero stars customer service . i use neither one again	1
i bought this tripod camera bag duo deal .... when they say professional , they mean professional . it large tripod , easy telescope out back again , but heavier longer , thicker than other tripods i've used . it appear well made very sturdy .	1
i received tripod ahead expected schedule . i've looking tripods stores around greater boston area . you can't get better tripod money . fact , you can't get anything " decent " under $40-50 even then i'm not sure you get something this good . i it shipped my job few guys office ( which i didn't know ) purchased tripod past where really impressed when i told them i only paid $25 it . conclusion : tripod perfect , no . head looks little like plastic . but it nice rubber feet rubber grip addition everything listed website . this tripod perfect beginner enthusiast photographer .	1
i'm loyal canon fan who only 4 canon branded lenses ( though i great sigma 70-300 ) .. said , i'm huge fan opteka grip . canon just not worth extra money . excellent build quality it , batteries it came work very well ( more mah than std battery ) . i heard some complaints how far you depress shutter release grip -- it further than camera , but very usable , since purchasing i've heard similar complaints users canon grip . save $ grip , get opteka get other accessories ... you wont regret i	1
i bought opteka battery pack grip my canon eos digital rebel xti , bit leary considerably lower price than canon brand battery pack grip . i am pleased report opteka grip met my expectations . prosthe grip fits extremely well rebel xti . it even comes convenient place store battery compartment lid ( which must removed insert grip into camera . removing lid easy procedure ) . attaching grip quick easy , large , serrated wheel tighten grip against camera bottom . finish grip different than canon-brand grip . opteka thin , rubbery , texturized non-slip insert layer over front , bottom back . canon grip rubbery insert smooth looks more " finished . " my only concern opteka insert it shows signs it may not stay perfectly attached grip , likely need touch cement future . not big deal , though . vertical shooting buttons grip ( exposure bracket , a-e lock , auto focus point selection , selector wheel shutter release ) , far i tell , identically placed like those canon grip . all work like they supposed . grip comes " on-off " slide so you turn off vertical shooting buttons when they not needed . this prevents accidentally activating one buttons or taking picture if they inadvertently pressed while shooting horizontal . battery compartment grip very easy remove insert batteries . although i haven't used it yet , optional aa battery insert looks easy use , good emergencies . two nb-2lh batteries came grip seem ok , charged up just fine . battery came camera , i now 3 batteries use . more than enough number pictures i take during typical shoo t.t he grip certainly improves handling feel xti , which comes too-small grip many hands . personally , i like additional heft mass opteka grip gives camera , although some may object additional weight . consthis very minor point , but worth pointing out . shutter release button opteka grip bit " mushy . " what i mean it not always easy tell when you pressed shutter releae halfway down activate auto focus or metering . there noticable tactile difference pressing shutter release down camera , shutter release grip . it if spring underneath camera shutter release button bit stiffer than one grip . however , if you use viewfinder determine whether you achieved focus or not , then little bit mush grip shutter release won't make no never mind . bottom linewould i recommend this grip friend ? yes . would i buy one if need arises ? yes	1
just sure get case it , because large screen could get scratched	1
i bought this camera two weeks ago , taken 100 pics , my battery still nearly fully charged . i thought i'd buy battery when i decided buy this camera , but i'm glad i held off , because it not necessary ( unless you're going two-week excursion bush no access electricity ... ) no problems red-eye , no blurry pictures when taken inside low light , outstanding battery life . i am getting more than i expected when i purchased this camera . i would recommend it ( show it off ! ) anyone	1
i love new digital canon . only problem it not nearly tough it film twin . i camera less than month when pop-up flash quit working . canon people great , very helpful , but i'd rather not send brand new camera back factory . photos , however , wonderful . film quality most part - printable enlargable . ( it would probably better use camera tripod when using 300mm telephoto but i hike it , so just remember steady it before taking wildlife photos .	1
i already digital rebel able sell it co-worker use proceeds my new rebel xt . faster , lighter , better . simple review . it took everything great my digital rebel made it better . some complain it feels " too light " ... ok ... it that your thing . me , it still solid pictures speak themselves . now , addition 10 mp rebel xt , i'll bet original xt purchased even better price . no downsides i think ..	1
clearly " rkm001 " some difficulty using this equipment . i one i used part my job . i probably cut over 1000 photos/labels/etc . other people office cut more than 2000 photos . it exactly what it supposed - it cuts straight line edge guide . where this problem arises when cutting surface , underneath cutting wheel , becomes worn use . i grove slowly develop since cutting surface not fixed position slide side side , grove not straight nor it parallel cutting guide . solve this problem , you should not use extreme force when cutting . gentle pressure adequate cutting photo . you also remove cutting surface rotate it 90 or even flip it over . this gives you four cutting surfaces work . ultimately you need replace it . carl makes those too . $20 , it works well unless you plan cut thousands times month , it fine home or light office use	1
it learning curve , that sure , but wow ! this camera worht every penny , far more stable then comparable canon rebel , product comes better lenses . quality glass matter	1
i taught photography college level , shoot 4x5 view camera work occasion , am very demanding image quality . i am quite satisfied image quality my kodak p880 , particularly after i installed newest firmware upgrade available kodak . i went through several 7mp 8 mp cameras before finally getting kodak p880 . p880 better image quality than some high end sonys olympus 7-8 mp cameras like dsc-v3 or sp350 . i tested p880 against even higher end 10.3 mp large sensor sony r1 difference image quality 13x19 print p880 r1 barely perceptible after minor sharpening noise reduction , which p880 images accept particularly well . zoom lens very useful range generally pretty sharp throughout its range . balance , manual controls features feel high end adequate most semi-professional needs . camera little slow processing storing pictures raw format exposure bracketing modes but really doesn't bother me because i mostly landscape fine art photos . raw file format directly supported most versions adobe photoshop photoshop elements well most other raw processing programs like bibble pro . unlike most sub-$500 cameras , p880 uses regular screw haze polarizing filters , real plus it highly controllable hot shoe . manual focus usable manual exposure control works well . direct mechanical zoom also nice . overall , p880 digital camera either high end point shoot slr-styled camera or one used fully manually most classic 35 mm film slr . although not small enough slip pocket , size still reasonable light	1
i bought this camera my work . i'm architect i looking camera wide angle lens interior photography budget wasn't going break bank . i looked kodak v570 , which 23mm fixed lens i seriously considering it but concerned durability reliablilty ( it seemed fragile ) . then i stumbled across kodak p880 ( kodak should really better job advertising their cameras ) , which comparably priced v570 . this camera next best thing digital slr , many same features . my wife canon rebel xt , which really great camera , p880 gives it really good run money regards features picture quality half price . i've this camera week putting it through its paces so far i very happy results . i would recommend this camera anyone thinking getting digital slr but hesitant slr price	1
i used my new nikon d200 this past weekend renaissance faire high heat , el3e performed like champ ( camera itself ) . i couldn't believe i got through three full days picture-taking ( using fill flash after five pm or so ) one battery charge . i finally ran out juice late third day , after approximately 500 exposures . ( one caveat : i don't use auto-focus . all . ever . so , you know , ymmv .	1
this excellent camera . i upgraded eos 20d which also great camera . i upgraded couple reasons . first full frame sensor . eos 20d 1.6 crop factor which effects your lenses overall focal length . eos 5d you get true focal length your attached lens . just like film slr cameras . awesome ! one problem i've noticed full frame sensor eos 5d it huge . when you changing lenses this sensor picks up every little piece dust , dirt fibers like vacuum . i'm constantly cleaning sensor blower . i also bring it canon service center . just remove some dust off sensor my blower could not remove . canon service center very far my home . ( very annoying ) . i never experienced this problem eos 20d . but , images you get full frame sensor far superior smaller sensor eos 20d . other reason i upgraded larger lcd . 2.5 ' lcd screen nice plus . images look bright sharp . overall i love this camera . build , features image quality excellent !!!	1
con:i've own this now 6 months , i shoot weddings portraits . i alot tests , especially picture modes . well don't waste your time these , their all bad , theexception landscape . you'll just end up using standardmode best all arround shooting . venetting accure arround edges , mostly low light . worst all color ballance or white ballance auto mode . what ever reason it hard time . my d60 out performs it here big time , not sure why . so you may shoota grey card get your white ballance more accurate . pros : quality pic excellent , color saturation awsome . blow up 2'x3 ' excellent detail , no noise . i've found focus mine real good , no problems here . ease use after learning curve becomes easy , just read manuel . conclusion : i would buy again except awb problem . now i owned both d60 10d neither seemed this problem bad . i use this mode when doing weddings because i'm always move go one differn't light sorce inbetween shots ( tungsten daylight ) . i still think canon best alway buy their products	1
i use this lens standard my rebel xt rather than 18-55mm lens came camera . it gives much greater flexibility outdoor shoots when i'm capturing my grandsons action soccer field .	1
this lens all i anticipated more . auto focus fast accurate . i gat stunning action shots	1
there no question paying $100 or more get you better monopod . but $16 sima smp-1 tremendous value . i sony dsc-w5 digital camera everything i think reduce camera-shake low-light photos . this monopod great adding stability making my photos less blurry . key it small enough light enough i take it almost wherever i go . because it so small , i bring it places would frown upon tripod . monopod not total replacement tripod . but this monopod now only addition my camera i take trips	1
this product served its purpose ; it same cord hooking up camera pc one came my camera	1
this cable four-point usb connector works some kodak digital cameras . sure your camera uses four point connector before buying this one . many cameras use five point connector . these kodak branded cables high quality fair price	1
i got this stuff gift friend mine . he seems happy using it . so i am giving this 5 star	1
i purchased this case my canon a530 camera . i find it great job light , durable , compact . it keeps camera clean scratch free . however i wish case better carrying capacity . i would liked bit more space spare batteries chips . i use different ones different pictures or video . batteries tend give out after long day shooting convient extras would handy . case beltloops but not good shoulder strap times when belt not worn . bit akward . otherwise this case good protector my camera fits it well .	1
i bought this camera when i sophmore college . now , 2 years out college , handfull beautiful days , half-dozen life changing moments , umpteen vacations later it still goes me everywhere snaps photographs . all sticker labels it since knocked off but it doesn't matter because i know what they all . this puppy built last . when i eventually pass this one down family buy new one , i'll getting canon sure . if you're looking high-value digital camera thinks it tank , get canon s100 .	1
i got these gloves use when taking outdoor photos winter . they work very well , little rubber grips help you better control camera without expose your hands elements . they not really warm enough really cold weather ( below 20 ) , but work well 20-50 degrees	1
i purchased this lens my canon eos 20d digital camera so far i really like it . it focuses fast produces very sharp , clear images . any longer lens you careful camera shake ; i've few images come out blurry but these usually interior shots . i really like 28-200mm focal length range find lens very versatile framing wide shots buildings or landscapes zoomed shots portraits or close detail shots . lens feels solid appears well constructed , which typical canon products . price range , this excellent lens . you only better spending considerable more money lens	1
we use it canon 300d . it gives good picture quality quick focus . become 44-320 300d . good buy	1
i needed more reach than 400mm gave my eos 1d , so i purchased canon 500mm f/4l three years ago . it incredibly sharp out corners f/4 . bird mammal portraits , you see every feather , every hair . lens light enough use wimberley sidekick . some claim able handhold it , but i think its eight-plus pound weight bit much . i carry mine long lens case backpack harness kinesis gear . this lens ' image stabilization works very well . i've used it tripod one-second shutter speeds good telephoto technique , gotten sharp , publishable images . eos 1d or 1ds , lens camera rain-proof mild storms . i also got mine through adorama , no problem delivery or post-sale advertising . if you buy one expensive long lens wildlife , choose this one .	1
amazon states ; product dimensions : 13.0 10.0 7.0 inchesthere no photo ( until i uploaded one ) so i thought this size stated , but turned out one little keychain bags 5x5 cloth inside . works fine , just not what i thought it , didn't want someone else think it large also . see my photo actual size next some keys . update 4/8/2006 i see they added photo what i thought i getting when i ordered .. see my uploaded photo " customer " photos see what they sent . not sure which you would get this point .. edit 07/29/2006i see now then price i paid jumps $5 $20 some strange reason .. i add it good product @ $5 but not $20	1
i am 67 years old started out photography kid contact printer box camera . i all types cameras over years , mostly 35mm film canon slr . i too bought all sorts these 5-7 mp point shoot digital cameras before returning my true love , slr . i my digital canon rebel xt month now i can't keep my hands off it . it lacks nothing . although kit lense good , i bought 28-135 canon zoom lense image stabilizion produced stunning photo it . i love way you use 7 points focus , i mainly use only center point focus lock never get out focus picture . i guess nicest thing me i now don't urge buy every point shoot camera paraded out qvc or hsn " wonderful " new feature like " low light or non-shake . " this canon every good feature known universe you can't outgrow it . its camera let you good you , it won't hold you back . battery life great , built flash good but i bought 430ex that even better . i never figure i'm wasting money buying accessories this camera it my main squeeze many years come . i always missed my 35mm canon slr now feel i old friend back again , only much much better . believe me , you can't go wrong getting this camea , its beyond description ...	1
i 2 rebel cameras so it just made sense me pick up this digital camera attach my old lenses . while i owned other digitals i keep going back my old rebel , until now . we got back up battery pack . my husband i love it	1
i love , love , love this camera . if you teens house watchout !, they'll definitely want this camera . it easy use well worth money . when my camera arrived , i amazed how small compact it . i let my son check it out first within no time we both using it . i really love movie feature . you record anywhere everywhere sound excellent . my last camera only recorded , but didn't any sound . it nothing compared this sony . 8.1 mega pixels makes pictures come out great . my sons i love it . they record all time take numerous pictures . i also like it internal memory , so if you don't memory stick yet , you still take pictures . 2.5 inch screen perfect . it makes it so easy get good shot all time . i no problems this purchase all . only thing i would recommend sony make something would protect 2.5 inch screen getting scratches , just like they optical lens . it always closed covered when its not use . but besides small detail there , sony great investment . i definitely buy sony again , especially when i decide update or if i'm looking gift give .	1
photography afficionados long two choices when it comes buying digital camera : tiny everything-automatic portable camera takes decent pictures or brick-sized everything-manual professional camera takes fantastic pictures . almost decade after introduction consumer digital camera , sony finally taken swing combining best qualities both worlds into one package , dsc-w100 solid first effort . sony tiny part down some time - dimensionally , w100 par other recent cybershot models competitor brands ' offerings , features now-common 2.5 " bright lcd display minimum buttons back . aside attractive mini-diamondplate face chrome trim , visually there little set this camera apart among others your local electronics counter . initial toying camera doesn't dispel any first impressions . all prerequisite automatic features there , buttons smartly arranged so all most common functions right hand , it obviously point-and-shoot camera . but it when you begin delve into features you realize w100 something entirely differen t.t he usual mode knob there back auto mode scenes modes , but now there program manual modes - something standard issue professional cameras but radically new point-and-shoot . this means you use any combination auto or manual settings all functions get shot . example , shooting dimly lit room , you use slow shutter flash even out lightning , or turn off flash slower shutter richer colors , or raise iso so you get steady shot higher shutter speed , or just put it auto shoot , etc . all different possibilities previously reserved just professional cameras now your disposal . camera simple or involved you want , it still fits your pocket . i've owned several other digital cameras , both portable pro , they've all somewhat manual features , but w100 takes it new level . mounting w100 tripod , i attempted get long exposure shot night sky , something all other digital cameras adequately . manually setting shutter speed , camera displayed overall exposure value i adjusted - camera telling me before even touching shutter button if resulting picture would dark , bright , or even . i set shutter slow it could go using two-second timer , fired away . picture amazing ; though only few stars visible eye , w100 caught light well over hundred . i noticed bit radial blur stars around border image , only realize later camera pointed north - shutter speed so slow i actually * capturing rotation earth * . now that manual . also special note w100 digital " smart zoom " . general rule digital cameras , you should disable digital zoom feature , zooming beyond optical range produces cropped therefore lower-quality image . but here again sony trick up it sleeve , cropping 8.1 megapixel capture regardless where you image size set . if you shoot 5 megapixel-size picture utilizes digital zoom , image actually captured full 8.1 mps then your 5mp picture cropped . result optically-zoomed clear picture . this also means lowest image size , you get full 15x zoom ( equivalent 500+ mm telephoto - pocket camera ! ) . it absolutely brilliant technique you'll probably see all future digital cameras . sony still bit more work pocket slr idea . included your purchase accessories catalog featuring array lenses filters , none which compatible w100 . it typical sony bizarre distribution features any given product lineup , but it would seem obvious most slr-like camera should slr-like accessories . w100 owners should disable auto focus illumination light when shooting people ; blazing red light great focusing inanimate subjects , but could probably used tactical light blind assailants pinch . overall , w100 remarkable newcomer truly raises bar what you expect point shoot pocket camera . novices accommodated full automation , learn gradually trying out individual manual functions while other settings remain automatic . experienced photogs right home manual mode wide range settings . five stars what hopefully sony work progress	1
bought one these year ago . works same canon battery i got camera . i alternate canon lenmar batteries haven't noticed any difference	1
silver , light , sturdy .. carries camera securely neck or belt	1
battery pack arrived quite quickly , we delighted paying far less it than manufacturer charging product works just fine	1
i received short amount time just what i needed . this way i am able my camera turned almost full day using this backup nothing worse than needing little more time able get enire family reunion unable add last family into scrapbook but this cured it all	1
np-bg1 type lith pack good picture life , but i'd carry spare if your going use your cameras movie feature	1
this bag year now love it . this what i carry main compartment : nikon d50 18-200mm lens attached . wide angle 10-20mm lensdepending where i'm going - either d50 charger , speedlight other little accessories or my canon sd550 elph its charger . top compartment holds extra batteries , cleaning supplies filters . small zipper compartment flap little bit tight anything other than cleaning cloth , extra memory , id's/credit cards . cons : woman ... strap isnt all flattering going diagonally across front , but i usually carry it sort " 1/2 slung " position or fully around front anyway ( unless i'm hiking ) . it could little snug inside if you trying carry alot accessory items . would liked see padded portion main strap little longer so padding still shoulder when bag front slung position ( since i carry it way alot ) . pros : compact yet perfect fit my camera body , 2 lens , accessories . very snug secure back - easily hike , ride bike or even horse without fear . no trouble getting used " slinging " it around front . actually use bag kind shelf stabilizing elbows while composing shot . superior lowepro design - great quality , sturdy zippers , love rain cover . note : i try slingshot 200 version 1st found it just too big my needs so exchanged it this smaller version - no regrets , cant imagine i'll ever need bag .	1
this my first review amazon because i've bought products never really felt like they deserved review . i would say i thorough search bag would fit me . i nikon d50 18-55mm lens 70-300mm zoom lens . i originally large nikon bag pain carry around . it inconvenient carry access my camera . so when searching bag i wanted something compact , easy carry , could hold my gear neatly securely , my camera easily accessible those moments when you want take quick shot put it right back . i went camera stores tried bags , looked all over internet reviews finally came across lowepro slingshot 100aw . it everything i looking plus more . besides able hold my camera gear , it able hold my battery charger , cleaning supplies , extra batteries , filters , built all weather cover . even all packed i still space my wallet , cellphone keys , thus freeing up my pants pockets . great thing bag it able give me extra stability when taking photos when bag slung around front me . bag so well designed there no worry bag opening up all your expense gear fall out . opening where you remove camera straps prevent it opening all way accident . all all i am very satisfied bag . i would recommend it anyone but if you more than couple lenses your photography arsenal i would upgrade slingshot 200aw .	1
no need run guess whether self-timer already fired when i want picture together my girlfriend . extremely useful when taking shots low light conditions long exposure , too . works perfectly my d50	1
i use it my nikon d50 it works promised . i took some long exposure shots it last night they came out crisp . i am also parent i find using remote much easier than setting timer rangling toddler place within limited window time . i recommend this device anyone i find it quite affordable . like most reviewers , i think it would great if it included accessory	1
i am fisheye lens addict . i this lens few months now , i use it almost everything . lens worth every bit i payed it . sigma customer service so fast easy . lens takes clear sharp pictures everytime . this lens takes best skateboarding band pictures ! if you considering this lens , i would definately reccomend it . i love how pictures either circular or full frame . its great investment ......	1
2 toddlers , i'm type person who likes camera me capture those unexpected moments film . elph cameras ideal this because they're small lightweight . i used 3.2 mp canon elph before this one , i thought 3.2 good until i started using this new one . clarity stability control sd700 great ! downloading photos my computer takes only seconds . i highly recommend this camera	1
worth money every way . sturdy , compact , great pictures , easy use , easy upload images	1
polarizing filters used eliminate glare non-metallic surfaces like glass or water . they also used increase contrast color saturation your image . i use my polarizer not only eliminate glare , but also make skies nice shade blue or get some " pop " out clouds . there so many options consider when purchasing polarizing filter your needs . instance , linear vs . circular , film or digital versions , or quality vs . price . if you making use ttl or auto-focusing system , circular polarizers designed work those features . linear polarizers their uses , but they manufactured differently may not work . unless you certain , just get circular polarizing filter . there some digital circular polarizers market . i am not sure what makes cir-pl lens better digital opposed film . i use canon 20d digital slr see no problems caused using supposed non-digital filter digital camera . most time , when it comes filters ; you get what you pay . mean you need expensive polarizer ? course not , just sure get right filter your needs . what ever polarizing filter you get , make sure it color neutral prevent unwanted tinting . spending more color balanced filter save time post . if you need multiple filter sizes , consider saving money using step down rings . currently i use hoya pro1 filters , canon polarizing filters i previously owned without question bulkier heavier . weight might not seem like much , but when you stick all your items backpack all extra bits weight add up quickly . i spend good amount time my equipment my back so this big concern me . when it came down images , times i would see browning tint my photos . tint easy clean up photoshop cs2 , but i don't see problem hoya pro1 filter . overall , i would recommend against canon polarizing filters . i originally thought , " it canon , it must quality . " since then i replaced all my canon filters . this filter works , but comes cost disadvantages other similarly priced filters . pros : used film or digital cameras eliminates internal reflections ghosting cons : bulky heavy not neutral color balance	-1
i recently test drove d200 impressed useabiity camera . it almost perfect . when buying i opted d80 because it very similar feature-set less cash . which meant additional money lenses . ok , it doesn't shoot 5fps or alloy body weather seals , but it sensor useability . it light , quick joy use . changing settings such iso , wb flash almost easy d200 . this fine camera . it uses sd cards - much more preferable than cf my opinion . worth every penny	1
this camera called " pro-sumer " model you should really take title seriously . quality pictures it takes just good professional digital camera same resolution . trade off it really not happy thrown bag ( or big pocket , if it fits ) . why ? because canon given it really annoying power-on switch guaranteed turn camera 90% time when you're moving it or bag . compound this problem , lens extends ( your bag ) , pushing off lens cap leaving it open possible damage . so , if you think this professional camera , kept real camera-case , you'll probably okay . if you're somebody , like me , who likes throw his camera bag or pocket , you're going annoyed power switch . said , i love quality pictures all control camera gives you over every aspect taking them . cons : stupid power-on switch always catches turns camera ; lens cap kind loose falls off easily ; widest angle maybe little too telephoto still ( around 35mm ? )pros : awesome pictures ; tons controls all over outside camera allowing you control lot without resort menus ; professional features including flash hot-shoe replaceable lens ; great battery life ; awesome picture	1
camera more advanced photographer very detailed instruction booklet . takes excellent photos auto mode . memory chip included not near big enough	1
this outstanding value . kit includes three often needed filters well excellent filter wallet . wallet itself , included tiffen booklet added extra value . i found it great value money . you get all three less than price one filter filter wallet added bonus .	1
this camera case exactly what i looking . it fits my canon sd600 perfectly . it fits like glove- not too big , not too snug , it not scratch lcd screen . it really cute nice punch color contrast basic black every other camera case out there . i've gotten lot compliments how cute it . i definitely recommend this product !	1
i love this product ! case slim enough carry around purse without taking up all room . red color fun , too !	1
need clean your digital slr sensor ? this besy way it -- conjunction wtih sensor swabs -- canned compressed air add " junk " which make your sensor worse	1
i camera w/ 12x optical tons features but i wanted something compact ready take quick snaps . this fits bill . my recent vacation i impressed how quickly it booted up focused get those unplanned shots . x-large screen makes it really easy see if you got good one image stabilisation seems work better than my previous camera ( canon a80 ) ... either or my hand steadier . last but not least - battery life impeccable . i took nearly 200 photos , plus spent lot time reviewing showing off pics friends no need recharge . battery ' custom ' one which concerned me but charger very compact travels well . it integrated prongs fold flat when not use - no cables :)	1
i wanted buy compact slim d-camera . those larger zoom quite bulky , you can't carry around all time . i think slim camera better choice . i slip into my pocket while wondering around come across something nice take picture it . you can't it huge camera . after i made up mind slim camera , my choices either casio exilim or sony dscw series . casio exilims very sexy . they lot mode scenes . they also function voice recorder . you take pictures book pages etc . they anti-shake capability which said reduce blurred images . i almost buying casio exilim . diligent person i wanted search more more . i found out so-called anti-shake feature bogus . many people found it useless . good reason choose casio . then i found picture quality exilim not really good . i found some pictures taken exilim . they soft , not crisp colors . search web reviews made photo professionals . casio exilim rated significantly less than sony picture quality . iso 200 noise still detectable most reviews . those same reviewers however found sony dscw doing better job . there no noise iso 400 which means even lower light condition sony better job ( less granularity pictures low light ) . big difference !. one feature sony made it very attractive its strong macro . it 0.74 inch which means you bring your camera 0.74 inch ( 2 mm ) close object ( say bug ) still take brilliant picture it . now comparison exilim sony summarize : casio exilimanti-shake ( it bogus)slim lower macro ( 2.5 inches)lower picture quality ( detectable noise iso 200)a lot scene modesquick shuttersony dscw seriesslim ( fact it slimmer)higher macro ( 0.74 inches)higher picture quality ( no noise iso 400)not lot scene modesquick shutterso ..... i purchased sony dscw 7 mp . i took lots pictures . they all brilliant , detailed crisp , true colors . i tried macro took pictures bugs . you see hairs legs bugs . absolutely no noise whatsoever , no blurry . it marvel technology . i took pictures fireworks july 4th using high iso setting . they came out brialliantly like professional pictures . it also uses different kind battery you can't buy your grocery which leave you vulnerable . so you may wanna buy spare one ( 40 bucks ) . but you always recharge it . it lasts much much longer than aaa or nimh batteries . it perfect choice . i highly recommend it .	1
we really like this camera ! it whole lot better than our previous one , which ran off 4 aa batteries , ran through so many aa batteries so quickly we can't even guess how many $$ wasted . this optio camera uses very nice rechargable batteries cost $5 each through ebay ( don't buy them here amazon ... ouch ! ) we've got 3 batteries getting two more so we never even worry power while long trip . ( really handy travel charger also awesome ... get it ebay just few bucks . ) startup time shutter speed very fast , so catching quick pictures finally possible us . ( my wife no longer threatens go back film after using this camera ! ) our last camera would take so long focus we never got candid shots we wanted . one only thing that even slight problem this camera power button next shutter button . ( what clueless engineer thought would good ?? ) however , now we've used it lot , we never hit button accident . all other features camera great . 1 gb memory card , we've never ever run out memory space , even taking lots short videos many many pictures medium quality . great camera , worth every cent . buy accessories ebay you'll find getting everything you need not very expensive all . ( actually , we bought camera ebay too , but these reviews great here amazon . thanks , amazon !	1
i this camera year now am very impressed . i used nikon 35mm slr all my life so i little hesitant going into digital . lugging around equipment became too much issue so i started looking . picture quality great even full optical zoom . i very rarely use digital zoom . most impressive ... camera taken 2 direct hits concrete ( 8 months ago ) still works perfectly !	1
i've this camera since just before christmas 04 . i purchased www.bhphotovideo.com $350 . i should waited until after holidays , because price come down . it great finally small camera . i often forget i even it me ( which i guess bad ! ) . over all pictures good . focus sometimes soft . it doesn't take good night photos , but takes great daytime pics	1
emphasis portability , canon digital rebel xti designed firs t-t ime dslr photographers travel enthusiasts . measuring 5.0 " 3.7 " 2.6 " weighing 1.1 lbs ., it large largest point shoot cameras one smallest dslr camera bodies market . its size source both popularity criticisms . if you large hands or heavier lens , it may feel too small . optional battery grip help , but some want something more substantial . visit store nearby find out yourself . package includes camera body lens cap , battery , charger , manual , catalogs , neck strap , usb composite video cables , cd-roms . you need lens compactflash memory card . there may some static energy packaging , so remove lens cap dust-free environment such bathroom prevent dust entering sensor . much promoted sensor cleaning system helps , but it best not get any first place . canon sells 4 versions xti : black or silver finish or without ef-s 18-55mm f/ 3.5 - 5.6 lens . black or silver largely personal preference , but most lenses , most accessories , all but low-end dslr camera bodies black . kit lens , it affordable introduction dslr capable if used exclusively f/8 or f/11 apertures ( soft other apertures ) . other words , lens not ideal shooting under low light . if you don't get zoom lens now , start canon ef 50mm f/ 1.8 ii . it famous top-notch performance very low price . due xti aps-c image sensor ( compositions multiplied 1.6 ) , this lens becomes 35mm-equivalent 80mm . if you budget good zoom lens , over 100 lenses , canon you covered . some canon popular zoom lenses include ef 28-135mm f/ 3.5 - 5.6 usm , ef 17-40mm f/4l usm , ef-s 17-55mm f/ 2.8 usm , ef 24-105mm f/4l usm . if these too pricey , third party vendors such sigma tamron make canon-compatible lenses less . their focus not nice canon usm but they generally outperform canon lower-end lenses . tamron sp af 17-50mm f/ 2.8 di ii ld aspherical ( if ) sigma 18-50mm f/ 2.8 ex dc af 17-70mm f/ 2.8 - 4.5 dc macro popular among budget-minded photographers . 10.1 megapixels image sensor , xti benefit sharper lenses . although increasing resolution over same image sensor area increase noise , canon improved sensor technology maintain low noise floor high dynamic range . performance wise , there very little criticize . great example canon trademark smooth , high contrast , saturated , low noise . noise remains low even iso 800 . it said shooting raw equivalent getting extra exposure ( 1.0 ev ) it help you maintain usable details acceptable noise iso 1600 . low noise gives xti bit excuse missing in-body image stabilizer . according canon , lens more effective location image stabilizer , especially telephoto . that true but i think feature would've nice . consolation , xti mirror lockup reduces vibration caused mirror movement . my sole performance criticism metering mode . it includes only partial not spot metering mode ( very useful when shooting high contrast scenes such candlelit birthday cake ) . perhaps more problematic evaluative metering mode , which occasionally underexposes images 2/3 ev or so . some criticized xti " plasticky " build . except metal lens mount , exterior largely made high quality engineering plastic rubbery paint . if you drop it , it probably crack or break , but it sturdy well made . flipping power lever , it starts up almost immediately ready use . much promoted auto sensor cleaning kicks when powering up down . most dslrs , there virtually no shutter lag it focuses split second ( especially when using usm lens ) . continuous shooting mode fast memory card , it take 10 raws or 27 jpegs 3 frames per second . raw images 10 mb each , so get speed 2 gb or larger memory card , such sandisk ultra ii series . replacing both 1.8 " lcd info display 2.5 " high resolution lcd led backlighting . it displays current camera settings , photos memory , menu . thanks greater real estate more refined user interface , xti very intuitive pleasure use . minus 10% lower battery life , which merely adequate begin . xti 95% crop 0.8 optical viewfinder displays 9 auto focus points , shutter speed , aperture , more , but misses iso speed , white balance , metering mode . overall , xti viewfinder more than adequate but pales nikon d80 larger more comprehensive one . highlights software package imagebrowser ( mac os universal binary ) , zoombrowser ( windows ) , digital photo professional ( mac os universal binary windows ) . imagebrowser zoombrowser easy-to-weight lightweight applications managing jpeg raw . digital photo professional considerably more powerful lets you use xti dust delete data feature removing dust its sensor cleaning hardware couldn't remove	1
first all i must say this camera take some wonderful , even incredible looking pictures . but since everyone else proclaiming its virtues , i write mainly its negatives . there aren't too many , but it few drawbacks ; couple which i just don't understand . this camera now fourth digital camera i bought . first nikon coolpix 995 my wife . second sony f707 me . third canon sd400 my wife . lastly xti me . so i little experience cameras or near " prosumer " level . this why i find it hard believe how xti get some these things wrong . first all white balance . my 4 cameras , this camera , far , worst indoors auto white balance . i am using compact fluorescent light bulbs daylight lights house xti makes everything look yellow . none other white balance options close either . one saving grace custom white balance option . you perform this custom white balance taking picture something gray ( preferably large gray piece paper or card made just this , it centered picture ) then selecting this picture custom white balance reference . after doing this white balance nothing short superb . i even it work just zooming something white then selecting it reference picture . ( i guess white works just well gray . ) but my disappointment , " why this all ? " all three other cameras mine handle this lighting much better than xti . but what really saddest canon elph handles it better than xti . it nice , after some hassle , it good white balance . but i shouldn't carry around gray card everywhere i go or touch up every photo i take get right white balance . especially when 1 � year old canon it better , half price . my next gripe lack spot metering . it wouldn't bother me so much if : 1 ) other metering options more consistent . 2 ) every other camera i own didn't it . 3 ) canon tech support hadn't told me they reserve spot metering their higher end cameras ..... especially when their own [ ... ] it !! how $500 camera higher end than xti ? usually i select partial metering then turn up exposure 1/3 2/3 stop get decent exposure . but it would much more consistent just spot metering option ; especially backlit subjects , or lot harsh , low sun shade picture . my last gripe included software , especially raw pictures . don't even try loading this software anything but dual-core or 4 ghz pc . software ssslllooowww !!! one thing , both zoombrowser ex digital photo professional start scanning hard drive pictures soon software loads , there doesn't seem any way stop it . if you lot pictures your computer , it take long , long time before software lets you anything . make sure you coffee ready ! other thing software just memory hog runs excruciatingly slow ; especially when trying edit raw or . cr2 files . speaking which , why canon use such non-standard file ? i would glad use some other software editing my raw , but canon proprietary files can't opened other " normal " programs . so now i'll just stick . jpg . then there other complaints , which true . kit lens isn't very good . form-factor could use work . ( i am constantly hitting fel button accident ) view finder kind smallish ; among others . overall i am pleased camera . i some wonderful pictures already wall . but i've also few real stinkers due lack spot metering occasional terrible white balance . if it weren't these two ( rather huge me ) issues , than i would give xti 5 stars . but until canon fixes these glaring issues it won't given my highest rating . it also won't recommended me anyone who serious into photography .	1
i bought this lens replace kit lens rebel xt . i find this lens very good value , very good value . i also canon 28-135 3.5 ... find 28-105 lens very stong lens price . it might even just notch clearer then 28-135 but half price . it size nice light weight fits nice rebel since it smaller dslr . all all , great lens budet price but it dosn't act like it . fast focus , fair range , nice size , easy lug around . i would sugest this lens any one first my list someone who not wanting go crazy lenses extras their camera , just want simply get some nice pics without spending all their lunch money . also lens takes same size filters kit lens , so if you spent few dollers few filters kit lens your luck . i know i happy still use 3 filters i've already got .	1

it works great - no touching sensor brush . great produc	1
i bought this gizmo clear cmos detector my digital slr camera . it seemed like good alternative using specialized , expensive sensor wipes , it would not invalidate camera warranty . results my camera good but not perfect . many large particles dust blown off detector . however , some medium-sized particles merely pushed edges . nonetheless , i really like air blaster just my camera . aside my camera , i used this number other devices around my home office . it works particularly well clearing dust out vents my laptop underneath keys my laptop keyboard . however , it works poorly clearing out dust grime my desktop keyboard . summary , i would say this good device owners digital slr cameras , although it not perfect substitute sensor wipes . owners electronic equipment general , this clever device works reasonably well cleaning dust out some places	1
i am very happy gotten this flash .. it works pretty well , i like its performance	1
this camera first digital me , only camera i ever enjoyed . macro setting gives amazing closeups bugs , flowers , etc . purchase charger some batteries , i've kept it going almost nothing . better get big memory card , too . silly settings like " color swap " " fireworks " fun play . my only complaint it slow recover shots , so you miss some action kids , etc . price , it can't beat . gramma	1
very quick delivery . product exactly advertised . very happy whole process product	1
please aware this camera shock sensitivityi pretty happy this all-in-one compact camera until it repaired second time . it sensitivity vibration or slight bump while lens out way too sensitive real world . result it loses it ability focus zoom . it didn't help it commonly powered while pocket , lens protruding , thereby causing unintentional harm lens assembly . first time it happened casio repaired it under warranty . second time it outside warranty repair center wanted $137 repair it - that more than 1/3 original purchase price . i won't reinvest weak product . i'd rather put money into new camera altogether	-1
i spent weekend researching digital cameras , exhausting confusing , so many choose , when i store looking various cameras , customer just started telling me how much he loved this camera he just bought , which this one ; i assumed it ' sign ' . it . small size fantastic , put your shirt pocket or purse , almost weightless . quick shutter takes best pictures new baby grandchild any camera anyone family used . ( others sony canon digital cameras ) movies excellent . quality color images perfect , not too over-digitized some said . everyone family thinks i'm wonderful photographer , but it not me , it this camera . battery life really long , it take good pictures multiple types poor visibility situations . first month , i dropped it few times , once sidewalk it survived which impressive . viewfinder big advantage bright sunlight . after using loving it 9 months , telephoto froze . i sent it back casio , they fixed it ; it took 3-4 weeks , which little long , but not charge me repair . baby pictures fantastic , especially because it takes picture so fast , scenery pics all look like national geographic .	1
this lens top notch . quality photographs best i ever experienced camera .	1
i only wish i bought this lens earlier so i could using it longer . i am especially pleased short minimum focus distance - 3 inches . this allows you get very close small subject still fill frame subject . i no problems this lens i love it	1
love this battery . long lasting just good name brand	1
i canon sd-550 . this battery works perfect it . i've noticed no difference charge time usage when compare original manufacterer one . except price lot lower	1
this replacement battery half cost canon yet offers longer life . i bought it when i first got my sd10 . when one battery runs out , spare goes . lenmar still works great while canon near end life ! i am buying two more since they so cheap ! not buy no name batteries ebay . they not last worth darn basically waste money ! don't it ..	1
i olympus 5mp point-n-shoot camedia camera i pretty happy portraits . i annoyed w/ fixed lens prevented me taking good photos wildlife . i hummingbird feeders my backyard unless you've opportunity work hummingbird families years , sweet , tiny animals skittish don't often pose you when you get too close . when my point-n-shoot stopped focusing , i took advantage this situation rationalizing this bigger purchase . what joy it use this camera . 6.3 mp significant improvement over 5 ability take photos manual mode cannot understated . fixed point-n-shoot , camera refused shoot if it didn't " feel " it focus ... so it impossible shoot sunsets , lightning or other natural beauties " infinity " range focal length . rebel makes use compact flash - oldest , yet still best technology taking fast , high-quality photos digital cameras . my less than perfect rating due small memory buffer . you take up 3fps very easily , but if you click-click-click shutter , it doesn't matter if bigfoot , loch ness monster elvis start doing little soft-shoe right front you , time rebel finishes writing recent 3 quick shots cf card , shot century already slithered back into swamp time camera ready used again . if you're taking portraits , not problem . click here there you'll never notice lack memory buffer ... but if you're shooting ball game or other quick moving objects , you're going get frustrated very quickly . flash decent , but you really need good flash like 580 hot-shoe if you want better even spread avoidance red-eye . lot folks shrug red-eye since most affordable or free programs like iphoto or photoshop elements built-in correction red-eye - but red-eye correction one click only available humans . if you're shooting wildlife , forget any software one-click ( or million clicks ! ) solution blue-eye dogs , yellow-eye cats , flaming-demon eye bunnies or variety odd reflections you get bouncing off retinas various species . best way circumvent this problem avoid bouncing flash directly into retinas your subjects get-go . no more glare or odd reflections when you use better flash . ability upgrade better lenses crux slr ownership . sky limit . get good wide-angle good , fast telephoto you've got yourself set some great shots . this camera isn't going take advantage cf cards faster than 40x , so you save money buying slightly slower cf cards , but i invested 80x cards so i use them when i upgrade cameras . this rebel gotten me back into photography after decade-long hiatus . camera automatically detects vertical shots turns them 90 degrees you lcd window . it quick easy adjust iso " push " film ( so speak ) take advantage low-light situations , but you get same grainy effects you when you push real film . iso 100 using 512mb cf card , you 157 photos your disposal - if you push it all way 1600 , 104 shots same card . 400 , your shots already compromized regarding print quality ... but if sasquatch comes-a-knockin ' wee hours , you'll still get decent proof if you shoot 1600 . background film photography spanning 2 decades , i didn't even consult manual this camera use it fresh out box . it handles many ways like professional film slr , unlike point-n-shoots , there aren't cryptic settings no film parallel . sunny days outdoor shots , this camera sheer joy use	1
i purchased d-30 amazon last year i previously using digital nikon . improvement monumental all aspects . i subsequently drowned my camera , i am getting ready repurchase d30 . they not ready water yet ? i taken approximately 5000 pictures saved them all most usable format i continue same . photoshop software comes camera very user friendly , i am sure there many features yet learn , but i extremely happy what i already used . i hesitate say mastered	1
this camera great photographing artwork . it only camera i could find doesn't bow edges paintings or watercolors ( i think lot cameras lens distors things , but you can't tell until you photograph something supposed rectangular ) . color reproduction also good . if you want camera takes good pictures distant objects , or one higher than 2mp resolution , look camera .	1
this very nice starter camera easy use . batteries run out kind fast , but once i bought rechargeable batteries it solved problem ! surprising good quality small amount money i paid it	1
this my second canon . there lot whistles bells this camera take time novice figure out . my biggest complaint trying remember take off lense cap before turning it . my other cameras not cap . all all it takes excellent quality photos , so you not disappointed	1
i bought one when it first came market back may . half year 5,000 pictures later , here some my comments : - it great digital camera its own class . " class " i mean one should not compare it dslr because s3 not one . so not expect it overcome " shutter lag " easily , although among other dc ( digital camera ) i used , shutter lag s3 greatly improved -- degree i feel comfortable taking photos very fast pace , e.g. , catching flying birds . ( however , only good dslr completely eliminate shutter lag s3 not dslr . ) one also should not compare s3 " small " point-'n-shoot dcs . s3 not small those -- it won't easily slide into your pocket , unless your pocket relatively big loose ( like mine ) . but slightly larger body brings great features none small dc offer . - big optical zoom ( 12x ) . 12x great combined canon imagine stabilization , s3 turns into powerful large zoom camera superb imagine quality . my recent trips included shooting ( cameras case you wonder ) wild wolf yellowstone national park . this little s3 came out only one capture animals great distance , other " big guns " professionals carry . feature eliminates hand shake great effect i could shoot 12x low light still get quality photos . i also highly recommend " tc-dc58b tele converter lens " s3 ( or s2 ) which gives you 1.5 zoom effectively make s3 18x zoom ( equivalent 600mm lens ) . check how much those big telephoto lens cost ( close 10k ) ... - excellent video shooting . again feaure one almost never finds any other dc or dslr . s3 takes dvd quality video stereo sound , not just video clips most dc . this little ( almost ) pocket-size camera now forces our digital videocam into early retirement . - many other great features . however those more or less standard one always try argue some other dc may similar or better features . i won't comment those . summary , s3 great small-size dc . its superb lens offers big 12x zoom , two technology canon pride . it also offers dvd video shoot stereo sound -- this feature alone save you digital vidoecam . one suggestion -- get big sd card if you want shoot video too . i 4g sd card i think 2g must . also battery life excellent . it uses 4 aa-battery , which seems lot odd beginning . but it comes handy because long you get aa battery you never worry power . typical dslr , if battery out you day unless you find power outlet recharge ( your charger you ) . i one small complain . menu button back camera location where my palm presses body . sometimes i raise s3 i see menu viewfinder because my palm pressed it strong enough trigger it . press needed i lost several shots because this . i other dslr quality lens . but i always take s3 me any trip	1
i purchased filter kit my sony camera . price considerably cheaper than sony quality great ! i'm looking into other items offered good price opteka	1
when i first got camera i nervous whether or not i'd able use understand it well since i usually buy point shoot type camera . i pleasantly surprised how easy it use all functions it really . pictures really high quality video crystal clear . camera lightweight perfect grab go or capture any occasion . i like design it i love fact i get professional looking pictures time time again ...	1
i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
i concerned when i ordered this filter previous problems reported here . but , i hurry needed two these vacation . there absolutely no problem product . both filters sealed perfect condition . could packed little better shipping box , but arrived good condition . no problems photos taken this product	1
this lens superb . it feels like high quality pro lens ( not surprisingly ) . shots just stunning ; fantastic color , razor sharp , beautiful bokeh etc etc . i initially considered 18-200(vr ) until i saw comments this lens . look into it , what i tell there very little ( real ) comparison two . i believe you forget how much you paid soon you see results . i mention this lens superb ....?	1
i love this lens . this excellent complement my nikon 28-70 2.8 . it well balanced d200 f100 ( mb grip ) . just last weekend used family wedding . it really not lens casual photography . if you not willing tolerate heavy equipment , sincerely , you take much better pictures ps digital cameras , i sometimes . after all taking pictures capturing moments if this lens get into your way , it no use . i personally only prefer fixed 2.8 apertures across zoom range . this very important me since i like use mostly aperture priority especially taking people pictures . why i love this lens . this very expensive lens . if vr not important you , go more reasonably priced almost identical optical qualities nikon 80-200 2.8 . me vr very important since i cannot afford use tripods when i am moving around taking pictures my kids or friends . if you could afford it , it great lens you never regret . if you cannot afford it just you thinking purchasin expensive camera body , don't waste your time camera specs , d70 vs d200 vs d2xs etc . buy cheaper camera , but still buy this lens long you willing carry heavy equipment around comitted take pictures such heavy equipment . bokeh amazing , rich contrast , creamy blurring behind subject 2.8 simply delicate delicious	1
this uv filter it job protect lens well . build solid ( metal construction ) . glass also descent quality . performance , it absorbs some uv light . uv light absorbtion hardly noticeable , probably sky 1-a haze filter version absorb more uv light than this lens which fine me . now , one problem which internal reflection . i've heard many people say it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out it not caused directly low light/night situation . internal reflection appear when there strong/bright source light comparison overall exposure ( surrounding environment ) . put it example ( which hopefully easier understand ) , when you take picture lamp during nightime light much brighter than surrounding area then you see internal reflection . you move position light closer sides/corner picture ( not center picture ) , internal reflection reduces finally dissapear ( if you move light far enough center ) . if light isn't too bright/contrast compare surrounding environment then there no internal reflection . but course most time , lamp nightime often very bright . but point i'm trying make internal reflection doesn't happen all time during low light or night time . additionally , internal reflection isn't only happening night . it also happen afternoon if you taking picture sun example . basically same rule above , how bright light source compared surrounding area , you move sun center photo near side internal reflection move side/dissapear ( also depending angle ) . but best way just remove filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you reduce occurence internal reflection identifying correctly when internal reflection occur then remove filter during those situation ( which not hard ) . i'm actually not fan lens filter ( any filter ) i think it only degrade picture quality we added layer sensor object , but i decided use them anyway all my lens . i would recommend everyone get one this filter if you don't any filter your lens .	1
it better save camera real lens which replaced this filter broken than expensive lens behind it . this real " lens saver "	1
i am only giving 4 stars , because i just receive it through mail couple days ago . so i still haven't get chance fully try out everything . but i tell you this camera very handy , it very small i throw it my small purse ( my purse usually don't much room , b/c i would already so much stuff it , like my pda , i-pod , cell phone , wallet , keys , pack tissue et . ) take it me anywhere . i love design this camera , it very cool . pictures pretty clear , even one taking during nights . thing i love this camera it not noisy , it very quick ( i no patience , so it good me i snap pictures crazy quickly ) . overall , i find this camera pretty good .	1
this camera fits easily my pocket takes fantastic pictures ultra compact . it easy use i no problems it	1
i've upgraded older canon series this sd600 . price i payed just under $250 . purchase spare battery - they small worth small investment carry extra , get bigger memory card , 6 mp take up more room so you need more space . 2.5 " screen takes great size good clarity . except extreme brightness ( outside direct sun ) no problem reviewing my pictures . like previous canon this camera user friendly easy use . automatic settings adjust light settings take best picture it cuts out guess work doing it manual . downloading snap . computer interface easy navigate pretty self-explanitory . 6 mp all i need . i take lot pictures work , often zoom picture see details - this resolution just perfect . good balanace picture quality jpg size . any bigger , files become pain email ( especially size limits ) deal . look snazzy red case this camera - this fit snug case rigid so it gives camera screen extra protection without lot extra room . i just slip it into my purse or pocket - it really small without sacrificing functionality ease use .	1
i received this tripod christmas i am totally delighted it ! it comes case small light enough me carry . just few days use , it made difference my low light level non-flash photos	1

only problem i live holland things sent my daughter us then forwarded since you don't ship overseas . any hope may change future	1
this my first digital camera i ever bought , i am completely satisfied it . talk abt resolution or camera feature . all it packed into one small sleek camera . i recommend this digital camera everybody . i would say if i would decided later future get one . i would alwayz go canon . they best making digital cameras	1
this pouch godsend so i bought 2 . i use them my efs 60-mm efs 85-mm lenses . base feels firm so lens sitting inside protected won't go anywhere made out strong naugahide . pouch itself thick felt rope pulls made heavy nylon twine feels silky your hand . whole pouch well built protect but handled roughly still protect contents , your precious lenses	1
i love this flash . i just recently purchased it used it 2 big events it worked perfectly . i still don't know everything it capable doing but am still able work it just fine without even reading manual . i would definitely recommend this flash .	1
finally able put some money aside get new flash my d50 . i looked less expensive sigma flashes , but end i decided go nikon . i figured i spend money camera , i'm going get better flash . used it other day took some great portraits my daughter . flash worked like charm . it better than camera pop-up flash . pop-up flash comes handy if you can't or forget bring main flash , but it really nice extra power sb-600 . if you think your going lot indoor photography ( birthdays , holidays , etc .. ) this great flash . if you children , best bet portrait photos ,,, nikon d50 , nikkor 50mm 1.8 sb-600 flash . great combination very good price . we haven't take kids their pictures taken studio . this set-up , you take great portraits your kids their own environment more convenient time you kids decide . no traveling nice cloths worry	1
canon 1d mk iin bomb . i opted this camera over cheaper higher megapixel camera , 5d . it rare you need more than 8m pixels sharpness speed this camera nothing short amazing especially when comparing my other digital slr , canon 20d . this camera i enjoy many year	1
cover over lense broke/small lcd screen/ pictures pritty good/battery life pritty good/some images come out bit blurry if theres no flash your hands arnt steady/takes nice portaits/ easy use/ veiw-finder	1
eyeglass wearer , i suffered needlessly years	1
d70s minor update original d70 introduced 2004 , few new features slightly larger lcd . it still great camera , but expect it replaced new d80 , which 40 percent more pixels , 2.5 -inch lcd , additional useful features old price d70s . so , you probably save little money still purchase sophisticated digital slr if you wait until prices d70s stabilize new , lower level . , say , $600 , this camera would incredible bargain . d70s shined one best cameras its class since its introduction . example , it 1/500th second flash synch speed ( found no other camera but d50 ) so you keep ambient light under control avoid ghost images . its autofocus fast accurate , features both single-autofocus , continuous-autofocus ( tracking action ) , novel " automatic " autofocus mode switches af-s af-c required . if you no nikon lenses , get this camera 18-70mm kit lens , which very sharp versatile , rather than more limited 18-55 lens . you won't regret it	1
it learning curve , that sure , but wow ! this camera worht every penny , far more stable then comparable canon rebel , product comes better lenses . quality glass matter	1
i got this lens go wider 20d . i wanted go wider so i got 5d . started shooting events this lens i learned 580ex couldn't give me enough light dark . used lens during day . terrible problems lensflare . hood showed up edges pictures ( wide ) . went back 24-70l my primary lens . when this lens works circumstances right , results stunning . i'm trying use two flashes get power use it night , again terrible flare problems . whenever it matters i go back 24-70l . i just don't all these problems i t.t he problems 16-35 lens appear wide end . 35 lens operates well but that not what i bought lens . i love lens but it lens gives me most frustration worry . wish it cost less but what you	1
received some christmas cash , i put it good use purchase this lens . it works great my digital rebel certainly fine choice any eos canons . sure , it pricey little heavy , but if you want fast , wide-angle zoom lens , there little else equivalent . zoom range takes you wide scenics excellent indoor flash shots 35mm ( canon speedlite ex accessory ) . usm focusing motor quiet very quick . comes canon lens hood . don't forget add 77mm uv filter protect optics full time !	1
excellent product . easy get it started . great features , clear pictures . everyone sees it wants it	1
picture quality better than i expected . you still can't see picture sides , but straight it good . interface load my pictures very simple . i would like few more options available , but simplicity purposes , it works great	1
this camera excellent one !! really when you compare its price its results level quality you get you know why this best its category , i'm getting very professional results using it lot styles .. highly recommended	1
i'm really impressed , i bought sd-110 year ago quick small digital trips . i never planning take it diving . housing really impressive , i've 4 dives month i waterproof case ( wp-dc10 ) it works great . i so excited try it out i went water full memory card . i got down 35ft took my first picture " memory card full " . it easy navigate all buttons i able delete while following my buddy . taking pictures fast moving fish doesn't work out range flash 1-3ft . my deepest dive so far 109ft off monterey coast , i worked if it 10ft water	1
recently picked up hobby digital photography i not aware nuances importance some accessories . back " day " when shooting 35mm film i could barely afford cost processing - let alone what i thought fancy accessories . well - some reading trip alaska my canon digital rebel xt - i learned , appreciate , importance lens hood . i bought rubber lens hood ( not lens specific ) local camera store totally unacceptable - then bought lens hood my canon lens amazon . it works great - no flare - no vignetting - it makes lens look pretty cool too ! i would suggest hood all your lenses never shooting without - obvious - it saves front lens bumping damage which important longer lenses or tight quarters like shooting photo excursion boat full other people all jockeying shot ! amazon service prices - usual - fantastic although i hate wait things - i am usually happy i when i order here . happy snapping !!	1
pros : - reduces flare ghosting when shooting bright light . - helps protect your lens dirt scratches . - somewhat protects lens case fall . better break hood than front element . - makes you look more like you know what you doing helps keep others carelessly walking front you . cons : - increase lens movement windy situations , kind like sail boat . - takes up more room your bag , even when reversed they still add diameter lens . - people take more notice you , help blow your cover if you trying keep low profile	1
i this camera 4 yrs now - i take it all my business travels . whenever i get chance go out weekends , i take this camera my sony camcorder my backpack , roam streets new city shoot pictures . pictures i shoot this camera just awesome - no matter whatever experiment i it . most useful features : 1 . aperture control depth field preview - lets focus foreground blur background2 . shutter speed control upto infinity - lets you control amount time which shutter kept open3 . it pretty rugged , dont try dropping it :) i used it shoot pics ' maid mist ' niagara falls i almost thought i going lose it . but it worked liked charmnegatives - bulky , but you get used it , it always gets attention - cost developing film - what i these days just get photos cd , then develop only those photographs good . why this camera better than digital camera ? - if you spending $200 digital camera , i feel slr way far too ahead any digital camera price range - if you spending $1000 digital camera , digital slrs very mature today - worth buying . ideally , i would buy this slr , take this whenever i really want take good photographs , then i would also want $100 kodak digital camera casual shots . this would mean ideal combination . if you buying this slr , you also consider buying film/photo scanners ( available less than $150 now ) - which lets you scan negatives/positives without even going cheap cd print . reviews what i read amazon , these scanners must amazing	1
i am ameture photographer i love my new camera , i also enjoy my low price amazon your best ! im so happy i finally found price i afford !! thank you !	1
worked well while i took pictures fireworks over lake tahoe 4th july . only wish camera accessories canon logo weren't so expensive .	1
canon ef 85mm 1.2 lens earned ample praise photographers critics alike one finest portrait ( medium telephoto ) lenses available . it only one currently produced maxium aperture 1.2 ( decade ago carl zeiss introduced special , limited edition 85mm 1.2 planar its contax manual focus 35mm slr system ; this lens alleged optically superior canon . ) . this new improved version 85mm 1.2 autofocus 1.8 faster than its predecessor , via usm motor relatively whisper-quiet operation . fine optic working under low-light conditions , lens now better due its improved optical design faster autofocusing . without question it one finest series canon lenses available ; these new improvements only enhance its reputation . if i owned canon equipment choose canon ef 85mm 1.2 ii usm lens or its illustrious predecessor , then without question i would willing acquire this fine new lens	1
let me first start off saying - long time canon user . i own 6 or 7 lenses , including three series lenses , this far one my favorites - if not my absolute favorite . i shoot mostly glamour erotica type work 20d . so right there , this lens not true 15mm me - but 1.6 x15mm . it sharp tack . it light weight . it very short ( i call it nub lens ) . it autofocus amazing . very little barrel distortion ... highly recommended . this lens probably sharp ( if not sharper ) than my 24-70 2.8 or my 17-40 4.0 lens .	1
charger unit or batteries ( or both ) don't work right : i use batteries one time , rotation power my zen mp3 player . sometimes i put discharged batteries charger , plug it , light blinks red , then goes off . only supposed show either red ( discharged , charging ) or green ( fully charged . ) this morning 3 batteries show fully charged , i take one out , it discharged . all these problems happened first unit , i returned it monster after they took their sweet time , got replacement which works just erratically . monster stuff looks good , but it last time i am going buy their brand	-1

early adopter digital , dating 1999 agfa ephoto 1280 1680 current iteration nikon family , i attest this camera flexible any my film cameras i use studio location work . fujifilm migrated best features mecanical film camera over this model . hot shoe external mounted flash sync terminal off camera flash , cable release socket shutter button , fuji melded best analog best digital . 9 mega pixel resolution , iso 80 1600 , shutter speeds 30 seconds 1/4000 , 1.6 inch ccd sensor , fujinon 28 300 mm ( 135 equivalent ) zoom , tilting lcd monitor ( if you use those things ) , raw file format support , real time histogram display , eleven shooting modes , movie recording , af assist illuminator full manual control when needed , nikon , canon , olympus , et al lot catching up . no need change lenses means sealed camera equates sensor staying spring time fresh body . no dust getting every time lens swapped ( although , i still miss all nikon glass ) . all this less than $ 600.0	1
many options this camera mechanically body camera rather than internal menu so wanting change focusing method etc easy ! shaking no problem 10.7 optical zoom warning icons appear if it may problem . icons appear if subject isn't focused warning you change focusing method . automatic power turnoff save batteries after two or five minutes , your choice . you set camera take instant pictures ; again , your choice . this camera allows you set your options rather than camera go default after power off change it back your option . problem i my previous camera . maybe little pricey , but results great !	1
i paid $225 out door this camera it competes cameras almost twice price ! automatic setting , it takes incredible photos , but capability go manual if you so inclined . price , there nothing market comes close . macro this camera great close ups i taken even automatic setting unbelievable . if you looking something slr like , but not slr price , this comes close . course , slr take better photos if you expert , but if you amateur or intermediate photographer want something gets job , put this one your list ... taking price into consideration this thing doesnt disappoint . you glad you purchased this one !	1

i am not photographer , but pictures i take look great . it feels great know i capture memories vivid color too . ( that setting i always use . ) other hand though , there long wait time use camera again after picture taken using camera flash . i don't quite know why but it seems if you take many pictures quick succession then using cameras flash not best way go ! all all , price i paid quality quite suitable . if you don't any experience photography , buy this one	1
coolpix l4 great camara . love night modes , portrait . takes great pictures , took it our honeymoon , all pictures came out great . it also takes very good movies , i thought it wouldn't why i didn't go one speaker , but seeing cuality both pictures video , i should gone one mic , that l3	1
i'm using this hood canon ef-s 10-22mm lens 20d . it bit shocking how big this hood until you realize it really necessary very wide field view . canon 20d , lens equivalent ef 16-35mm 2.8 , only it 3.5 - 4.5 . bottom line it trick made same good quality rest canon stuff	1
amatuer photographer this gives me what i need price i afford . it many features i am still learning how use . difference pictures d50 takes dslr compared cheap digital camera like night day . i am really happy this camera lens combination i purchased . i anything macro spider zoom-in squirrel sitting tree . battery good life span i rarely change it my spare while shooting . remember puchase seperately your memory card it not part purchase . i'd recommend least 2gb card , which also purchased amazon . i able catch squirrel jumping trees because number frames you take each second . it also so easy take photos indoors without using flash obtrusive during event you photographing . i also recommend purchasing 52mm lens filters , keep your nikkor lenses free fingerprints , etc .	1
long time film person , i really wanted find digital slr could surpase feel quality film without guess . other digital cameras basically point shoot versions . two children athletics year round , d50 it all . we've shot over 3000 pictures past three months just soccer softball . nikon software makes converting storing breeze . only thing missing protector viewfinder , it standard d70 now d80 . there aftermarket available fine dept . i recommended d70 so many people nikon must put me their marketing team	1
i've my canon a510 over year i still love it . i've taken it vacation me several times , including one trip yellowstone park , where i took 1000 pictures . it great . it small light i like way it fits my hand . it fast . i never spend time waiting it . it takes great pictures ! it uses 2 batteries batteries last longer than my last camera lasted using 4 . only problem i've occassionally lens cover stick not completely open . i just barely touch it my finger it unsticks opens rest way so that not major issue	1
my existing battery aged i started look forward replacement . after i read several reviews , i preferred choose original one , because heating performance problems . therefore , i found good bundle price if i'd selected cord , battery case my sd100 camera . way , i not good case this new one . i rated 4 stars , because i preferred stay original cord	1
after researching numerous websites looking canon fitted case my new camera , i again turned amazon found just what i looking lowest price . leather case fits well isn't bulky , just protective . now i don't worry damaging camera dumping it my purse everything else so it always handy impromptu shots . neat , comfortable neck strap just added bonus	1
i ordered this camera december , it since then , it amazing camera . first time i ever professional camera , it takes time learn how use it . it not point shoot camera . if you want large pictures like crop , this may not camera you . however if you want ability take great pictures , learn how use professional camera great price this one buy . ability custom curves , which means predetermined parameters different conditions . ability chage iso random different conditions . you pay five thousand dollars its successor , dx2 , however $2000 this bargin you never find again . jim comfor	1
i bought this trip not only it fit my purpose but it makes camera look even cooler than it already looks . i several people stop me ask me what it so i got chance explain how it benefited me	1
i took plunge bought bg-e3 battery grip canon . after reading reviews off-brand model deciding i didn't want any ' button ' problems , i got canon . i'm very happy it , ( not standpoint extra battery capacity because i 2 batteries all times anyway ) but because i like ' look feel ' additional weight fit my large male hands . i felt without it , i might drop camera any time while it safely suspended my neck , i don't like feeling . i also like able spin camera portrait or landscape shots very quickly cleanly extra set buttons available change tv av settings various effects . i got some exceptionally nice photos waterfall this made it easy use . if you're thinking buying it , it worth every hard-earned penny should significantly enhance both professional amateur uses	1
i compared number pro-sumer cameras became firmly convinced this best camera money . although nikon one time considered premier camera professional , they now take second stage canon not only engineering , but quality lens , innovative user-friendly design , overall quality . i used camera approximately one month delighted . talken pictures over 35 years - including professional - always using minolta equipment all those years , i am truly enamored this canon camera	1
i my canon eos 30d week after 500 shutter actuations i am completely addicted photography . i bought 17-85mm canon lens it takes phenomenal pics especially using software post-processing raw . i also 70-300mm lens sports/outdoors/nature bursts 5fps beautiful sound . i bought camera through dell rebates currently this best deal out there ! strongly recommend . pay extra $$$ get this over rebel xti . you won't disappointed	1
this lens works very well two amateur photographers like my wife i . we take photos our kids their sports activities . even though lens little heavy side feels like we shaking little when we snap picture , none our shots come out blurry . i am pleasantly surprised this . we feel it well worth price we paid . ( under $100	1
i bought this lens when i purchased my nikon d70s february . i admit i not used it too much . however , when i used it , i am pleased results . mostly , i walking around town practicing taking photos , i little use 85mm , because it not good " point-and-shoot " scenes . when i taken portrait shots , however , 85mm very clear creates great depth field , which i find important . i hope this helpful	1
it very sharp lens . you wised use it extensively little children , they such clear faces . careful when you use this lens middle age women . it could show imperfecton thousand fold . again very sharp , very fast af focusing my nikon f80 . ecxelent portrature lens , but careful-women hate you unflattering portrature . my advise use black white film-you see less imperfection prints same rasor sharp focus	1
i bought this lens go my canon digital rebel xt . i absolutely love this lens . i got it try some insect other macro shots it served this purpose very well . some practice this lens produce fantastic macros some great bokeh boot . i read other reviews must say i never scared insect away noise mentioned before . i taken countless insect shots this lens . it bit louder than other lenses i but i don't see it problem . one problem i encounter when using autofocus busy closeup scene it often focus background instead say closer insect flower . when this happens i just flip it manual focus way . no big deal . overall , great lens even greater price . definitely worth it . ( i submitted photo bee i took couple days ago this lens example . )	1
canon ef 50mm 2.5 macro lens yet example canon doing fine job catching up likes nikon , zeiss leica respect optical design ; optically it may best 50mm macro lens currently available 35mm slr film photography . i am impressed lens cheap this counts least one aspheric lens element apochromatic lens design ; unfortunately it not nearly durable lens celebrated series lens line or canon ef 100mm macro lens . unless you constantly working out field taking close-up photography , then durability this lens lens mount barrel should not issue . more importantly user quality its images , read some test reports this lens , i no doubt it capable performer . those interested digital macro photography may choose look instead new 60mm macro lens , which optimized use canon digital slr cameras	1
this hood comes 100-400 , so don't buy it separately . pros : - reduces flare ghosting when shooting bright light . - helps protect your lens dirt scratches . - somewhat protects lens case fall . better break hood than front element . - makes you look more like you know what you doing helps keep others carelessly walking front you . cons : - increase lens movement windy situations , kind like sail boat . - takes up more room your bag , even when reversed they still add diameter lens . - people take more notice you , help blow your cover if you trying keep low profile	1
i didn't ton time research this flash . i've used it now several occasions my canon 5d couldn't happier it . it great shooting portraits . i shoot 10 shots row flash keeps up . i would definitely purchase plastic diffuser - get rid typical flash harsh light	1
i'll spare technical review 580ex flash now . i've using this new flash on-the-go shootings find it very helpful especially capabilities using multi flash units off-shoe mode . it great hard reach places where i want produce more light or fast moving subjects , i.e. wedding guests fast pets . i plan pick up least 2 more these units it compatibility most part . not only i get good light coverage subjects , but possibilities making more interesting artistic photographs defines my work . still nothing beats use higher end lighting kits like profoto acute systems . but that alot lug around .	1
i love this camera . it my second canon , 7mp , best value money i've seen . i took it france this summer loved fact i could recharge battery overnight while my friends constantly changing their batteries ( searching places buy them ! ) . my favorite option " scene " button . i don't think i'll ever try " underwater " option , but " night shot " " inside shot " work fantastically . it also seems though you take movies until card or battery fail - which huge improvement over my older canon . unlike lot newer cameras , this one viewfinder . friend mine nikon no viewfinder it extremely hard use bright sunshine . i carried my camera my purse without case few days ago new orleans without problem - it worked like charm . i would recommend this camera anyone who wants easy-to-use model produces fabulous results .	1

this hood more than adequate job controlling flare ef 100mm f/2 . additionally , hood provide protection those who 1 ) not adorne their lenses uv/sky filters , or 2 ) so adorne them ! lens already capable performer ; it moreso hood . price bit steep , but not effect its performance . thus , my rating stands	1
i bought this hood canon 85mmf 1.8 lens , one incredible lens . years ago i went lecture ernst wilde , mr . hasseblad himself , where he showed difference lens hood would make hasseblad lens . since then i always used them faithfully every lens i own . longer lens , more efective lens hood if it specifically designed lens . this hood canon their medium telephoto lenses , 85f 1.8 , 100usm macro , 135mmf 2.8 lenses . hood protect your lens dust , scratches , damage , while same time preserving maximum contrast your lens deliver . this differs filter , take away inherit lens sharpness contrast . analogy wearing baseball cap which improve your vision protect your eyes cataracts , while not distorting your vision like sunglasses	1
just received canon ef 2x ii adorama . paid $279.95 plus $17.95 shipping . len previously used placed back pouch sold new . len cap marred several scratches . looks handled rough . my advice bypass adorama third party vendor buy directly amazon . adorama refunds within 14 days less shipping . thats $17.95 me return used product sold new . won't go there again	1
we love this produc t.t ook me minutes hook up . so easy use . i understand total cost printing few cents more than what you get costco . but . its ease use home ! specially if u guests home .... you wanna give instant photos ... hmm .... cosco/walmart .... going christmas day ..... i dont think so !!!! my guests love it .... when we give them photos .... right after party ! everybody gets kick out it ! amazon ..... goog service ! time !!!	1
this camera excellent one !! really when you compare its price its results level quality you get you know why this best its category , i'm getting very professional results using it lot styles .. highly recommended	1
i 2 rebel cameras so it just made sense me pick up this digital camera attach my old lenses . while i owned other digitals i keep going back my old rebel , until now . we got back up battery pack . my husband i love it	1
my photography not much call wireless remote but this too easy pass up . it delivered advertised i am finding i am using it place wired remote ultra close up low light photagraphy when using tripod . it very small so it easy pack away anywhere	1
i like using tripod my long zoom lens , this device really added my hobby . remote perfect taking pictures birds my birdbath squirrels other critters my yard . i personally don't like cables , i don't like dealing them . this just right my purposes . remote also better taking pics people . it much better than timer my opinion since i move people out easier more efficiently , taking pictures more quickly . this gives me so much more control than using timer .	1
excellent camera high end capabilities . easy use intuitive system controls	1
my kids competitive tae kwon . i now used camera my wife gave me one year ago several tournaments . it able stop action take great shots even low lighting . now , we tried it when we went skiing it also worked great glare conditions snow . i bought monopod worked real well stabalize i use software called photofinale crop share photos . one year into usage i am still looking forward each chance i get play this " toy " . next options : battery grip , flash diffuser , extra remote flash ..	1
this lens produces magical images . i am stunned its sharpness , contrast color saturation . simply amazing ! this great option standard zoom aps-c cameras great wide-angle option full-frame . aps-c ussers , i sold my ef-s 17-85 usm because this just miles better . i simply love this lens ! i am now so sold difference makes , i also sold my telephoto lens 70-200 f4 l.i believe this great investment because : * canon lenses lose very little their value * should canon abandon aps-c sized sensor full-frame 35mm , then ef lens range make your kit far more future-proof * once initial sting price receded , you never regret quality images you take this lensjust try it - it awesome ! some reviewers call this slow lens - i would disagree . many zooms 3.5 - 5.6 , or perhaps 3.5 - 4.5 pro-sumer range . there virtually nothing 3.5 f4 , constant f-stop advantage . f4 not fast , but it certainly not slow , either	1
i also sb-600 this product , sb-800 , much better - worth extra $100 . it much easier use since it simple menu structure not wierd button combo selections sb-600 . flash output better , recycle time better you use flash commander other wireless flashes . also extra battery holder fifth battery reduces recycle time further never comes off my unit . diffusion head also included so you don't buy separate one stofen ... works great	1
nikon designed this unit exploit possibilities their latest digital slrs while still compatble their oldest f-series cameras . sb-800 more expensive than sb-600 , but it gives you more control more light . you may find more light critical if you want use bounce flash soften shadows . i would given sb-800 five stars if user manual little better . nikon obviously tried very hard provide good documentation , make user interface intuitive possible . but , unit so many features modes inevitably require effort learn , present cases where you working against built automation . expect make large number experimental shots if you really want learn how use this unit . my chief plea nikon would more straight forward explanation cameras like d50 not ttl flash . so called i-ttl uses pre flashes computation set up calculated flash rather than real time measurement during exposure quench flash . one would normally expect same result , but not if slave flash used . one beauties sb-800 , however , it used slave unit using its own sensor determine when master unit firing , even if ( case d50 using its built flash ) camera sb-800 not communicating i-ttl info via ir pulses	1
i say , semi-pro photographer , this one item made vast difference many my shots . it allowed me get studio like shots ( extent ) without use those giant studio flashes cost thousands dollars . i able just set up few hot lights use sb-800 off camera thanks amazingly wonderfull wireless feature got great quality shots what i needed . also , concert photographer , low light areas this works great especially since most tour managers don't take highly flash use , it allows me farther back get great shot since i know little more fill light work . sb-800 i say far one few products you won't regret paying high price . i originally thought getting 600 decided go all out get 800 after reading all featuers it sb-600 doesnt . this product , coupled my d70 dr-6 right angle viewfinder ( great investment you should all look into ) give me so many great shots , i say only design flaw sb-800 i can't use dr-6 while flash camera unless i buy bracketing system . most time though , when i am useing dr-6 i am angle where pop-up works just fine but there few times i wish i could use 800 well . so those who unsure this sb-600 , go this product . now all i find better lens then my sigma 28-300 i am all set . anyone know where find good deal 18-200mm nikor lens ? if so someone ( if there way ) please email or contact me i myspace search my companyhope this helps least one personbradpremier image	1
i'm amateur photographer , mediocre skills . this flash makes all my photos look better vs built-in , little no intervention my part . i use it digital rebel . i like flash varies intensity , depending ambient . time flashes reasonably quick ( particularly when ambient doesn't require full flash ) . avoid washed out faces , i'd always gotten accustomed bouncing flash off walls/ceiling ( my old camera setup ) . i've learned i don't need 420ex , almost always keep it directly pointed subjects ( unless i'm trying purposely create shadows across people faces ) . i also seem get much less redeye vs built	1
this flash working great me . it amazing recycle time . i able easily fire off multiple shots indoors low light without missing beat . i also used it completely dark room , all worked great . i don't like locks bounce head , it necessary press release side prior tilting . just minor annoyance	1
yes due released sept 05 updated new version this lens . it 70-300mm f/4- 5.6 lens new set up which viewed canon website . canon item number 0345b002 . msrp new version lens $649.99 i older version 75-300mm iii usm w/out i nothing but good things say lens ! ( i only paid $189.99 it ) can't wait this new version come out	1
owned 2 weeks : only thing cause me stop short 5 stars weight lens . stabilization great worth every dime . don't even think other 75-300mm non-is version , it junk - i tried it . you hand hold this lens 300 mm 1/60 !! no kidding . focus fast accurate my digital rebel - almost no hunting like other 75-300mm . you * must * get skylight filter protect front element . i'll update this review after few months ' use .	1
nick xu , if you can't figure out difference this lens , cheaper consumer grade lenses , all means , stay cheaper consumer grade lenses . after all , " mr magoo " cartoon fame couldn't tell chevy rolls royce . all kidding aside , this lens simply awesome use . one these lenses camera bag very close practice owning three or four high end prime lenses . yes , it good . i am using borrowed version right now , but soon i pay off my new 24-105 f/4 usm lens ( very , very awesome ) , i buy my own 70-200 f/ 2.8 usm . it good it gets this lens range , but if you feel comfortable pinhole camera , carry , it all end user . everyone else , this lens holy grail mid range telephoto lenses . it simply best available it range , responds well canon tele adapters . if you figure out way afford this lens , buy it , it all . if you nikon lover buy this lens anyway , buy fairly cheap 20d body make it work . it ok tell your friends you used nikon take pics , but you end up knowing canon premeir lens crafter 21'st century . ( sorry , nikon fans , but this lens stands all it self grand scheme things . it simply awesome . )	1
i love this camera ! i lot reading-up price-checking before i bought this item , i'm delighted quality product value money . this my first ' own camera ' i've almost zero camera experience , so find myself taking most amazing photos able edit/add text/e-mail them - well - wow ! i've stunned results this camera given , all within month purchase . basic handbook me taking quality ' normal ' photo within 24 hours , using this handbook i've progressed into some fantastic close-up stuff , some fun stuff too - get your spouse dress up sepia shots good laugh !! i've enormouse fun learning this camera - i've got loads more learn i feel some good camera work now within my grasp . this required modicom concentration diligence , but it paid off , precisely what i hoped . i found batteries came camera almost useless , but your quality name-brand batteries give excellent life - also , if you plan taking more than 15 pics time , you want memory card . oh yeah ! i'm ' old bird ' 53 years , so if i this , anyone :o	1
time this writing , there something wrong product shot amazon site : it makes lens look much shorter than it reality . it not large or heavy lens all , but it not _that_ short . i've mine ( part 20d kit ) year , during which i've taken maybe 4000 frames or so particular lens . lens still appears solid it day 1 , so no complaints departmen t.t he image stabilization ( ) feature works quite well surprisingly silent ( far more so than system ef 70-300mm ) . said , good fraction focal length range , relatively minor ( but still useful ) benefit this lens . autofocus ( af ) speed okay : better than kit lens came original digital rebel i used own , but not fast some other lenses i ( all non-l ) . af accuracy fine my copy . optically , my concern primarily sharpness . department , lens seems only marginally better than 18-55mm kit lens came original digital rebel ( which bought close $100 , i believe ) . it often worth turning off improve things , ironically . still , it not awful . i haven't found vignetting , distortion , flare , aberrations significant hindrances . part , probably due workflow includes dxo pro images i care . overall , i think this still pretty good choice lens keep default canon ef-s camera ( 30d , 20d , or digital rebel variant ) . optical performance over lower-end ef-s 18-55mm lens not _that_ great , but feature set may justify premium . higher end ef-s 17-55/ 2.8 alternative if you're willing double your investment change lenses get longer focal range : its imaging quality larger aperture certainly desirable . tamron sigma some offerings this range too , but i'm not all familiar them	1
i got this lens my 30d found it useful walkaround lens , able handle just any situation i threw it , other than very low-light situations . even dim illumination it able function fairly well , thanks image stabilization , which let me shoot shutter speeds slow 1/4 second hand-held . i wasn't thrilled barrel distortion wide end zoom range , but i able fix this using photoshop lens correction adjustment no problem . it simply additional post processing step that necessary	1
i got this lens replace kit lens came my canon eos 30d . this lens definitely more " substantial " lens than kit lens . even though outer housing plastic , it metal mount seems very durable sturdy . really helps improve image quality induced my unsteady hand . usm very fast quiet . i read accounts this lens not able lock , but i not any issues it varying ( including low ) lighting conditions . i know lens supports ftm focus , but i not tried it yet . i like focal length range this lens . 17mm even 1.6 multiplier , angle very wide . only drawback this lens me 17mm there significant barrel distortion . my test shots my next shot 24mm distortion completely gone this focal length . it not showstopper though since it easily corrected photoshop . all lenses i plan get , ( sigma 30mm 1.4 , canon ef 50mm 1.8 ii , canon ef 70-300mm usm ) , this most likely lens i keep camera most time , using others opportunities warrant	1
i am 6ft tall this such perfect tripod someone who beginning/novice photographer occasional moderate use ( would my guess ) . my fort� post-production , i am graphic designer needed something use my new dig camera . i lot research tripods this seemed what i needed my usage . plastic clips concern me somewhat durability long haul , but i would love surprised just my nerves luck talking . how you beat price regardless ? i am so happy this tripod so far . i love how tall it me particularly how easy it use . i so much research online found this 70 " one said " screw it " i am tired looking bought it . i knew i needed something accomodated my height there isn't whole lot out there us tall folks decent ratings hundred below dept . i didn't pesos make " hundred+ " purchase took risk here when i rated cost versus quality ( my head ) . i feel though i won this battle now . i like two " levels " ( i noticed ) make sure i am squared up this piece equipment . equipment smooth pan i using it my own photo work , video tours my husband realtor work recreation/family photos . i am excited use this more my dig rebel . legs extend easily . metal ( light weight ) body plastic clips pieces . comes black bag hold your tripod also . easy snap-off piece remove your digital camera attach . fact i just leave it always my camera it expedites process when i am hurry . tripod feels quite sturdy my rebel attached . i think this really good-looking tripod . it so so light weight portable . i love it not clunky loud assemble when pulling it straight out trunk/car quickly assembly . i would've liked seen manual recommended usage ways maximizing longevity product , but i am over it product great so far . ( revise 1 0-0 9-06 ) still love love this tripod . i use it all time . so easy use it so lightweight i just toss it trunk . so quick set up too . love it ... it rocks ( tall gal ) . :	1
i bought this battery canon 30d take around thousand pic one charge . very happy battery performance	1
some reason , canon- branded batteries better than those sold actual battery manufacturers . don't just look $$/mah ratio , consider safety , reliability longevity . these categories , canons rock . i bought g1 camera five years ago , camera toast , but battery still works like charm my 20d . others start out 1400 or even 1700 mah , but fail after six months - read reviews here amazon.com	1
i'm loyal canon fan who only 4 canon branded lenses ( though i great sigma 70-300 ) .. said , i'm huge fan opteka grip . canon just not worth extra money . excellent build quality it , batteries it came work very well ( more mah than std battery ) . i heard some complaints how far you depress shutter release grip -- it further than camera , but very usable , since purchasing i've heard similar complaints users canon grip . save $ grip , get opteka get other accessories ... you wont regret i	1
i bought opteka battery pack grip my canon eos digital rebel xti , bit leary considerably lower price than canon brand battery pack grip . i am pleased report opteka grip met my expectations . prosthe grip fits extremely well rebel xti . it even comes convenient place store battery compartment lid ( which must removed insert grip into camera . removing lid easy procedure ) . attaching grip quick easy , large , serrated wheel tighten grip against camera bottom . finish grip different than canon-brand grip . opteka thin , rubbery , texturized non-slip insert layer over front , bottom back . canon grip rubbery insert smooth looks more " finished . " my only concern opteka insert it shows signs it may not stay perfectly attached grip , likely need touch cement future . not big deal , though . vertical shooting buttons grip ( exposure bracket , a-e lock , auto focus point selection , selector wheel shutter release ) , far i tell , identically placed like those canon grip . all work like they supposed . grip comes " on-off " slide so you turn off vertical shooting buttons when they not needed . this prevents accidentally activating one buttons or taking picture if they inadvertently pressed while shooting horizontal . battery compartment grip very easy remove insert batteries . although i haven't used it yet , optional aa battery insert looks easy use , good emergencies . two nb-2lh batteries came grip seem ok , charged up just fine . battery came camera , i now 3 batteries use . more than enough number pictures i take during typical shoo t.t he grip certainly improves handling feel xti , which comes too-small grip many hands . personally , i like additional heft mass opteka grip gives camera , although some may object additional weight . consthis very minor point , but worth pointing out . shutter release button opteka grip bit " mushy . " what i mean it not always easy tell when you pressed shutter releae halfway down activate auto focus or metering . there noticable tactile difference pressing shutter release down camera , shutter release grip . it if spring underneath camera shutter release button bit stiffer than one grip . however , if you use viewfinder determine whether you achieved focus or not , then little bit mush grip shutter release won't make no never mind . bottom linewould i recommend this grip friend ? yes . would i buy one if need arises ? yes	1
i both canon version grip this version . they identical . i two rebel xts they work great . i like them feel it gives holding camera . camera small my hands this makes it perfect . if you thinking buying accessories rebel xt , this should one them . grip holds two batteries , which gives you way more shooting time . i highly recommend this	1
good quality , perfect attach , but no cord avoid loose it . incredible canon forget it !!! so ... remember put it inside your pocket when you use your camera	1
just sure get case it , because large screen could get scratched	1
i bought this camera two weeks ago , taken 100 pics , my battery still nearly fully charged . i thought i'd buy battery when i decided buy this camera , but i'm glad i held off , because it not necessary ( unless you're going two-week excursion bush no access electricity ... ) no problems red-eye , no blurry pictures when taken inside low light , outstanding battery life . i am getting more than i expected when i purchased this camera . i would recommend it ( show it off ! ) anyone	1
i am new slrs i cant belive how good this camera . this camera worth every penny amazing quality it produces . i always thot my old digital pics point shoot excellent , but looking back , they look terrible compared this .	1
it extremely easy use . hard figure out menu , but once there no problem . takes beautiful pictures . great action shots well . seldom find blurry photo it stabelizer built	1
this great product . i rather large lens it helps stabilize it so i don't blur my pictures when i'm taking pictures kids playing soccer . however , people think i'm professional photographer local newspaper when i use it grandkids ' games .	1
it works fine , but canon s2 digital camera sometimes feels little heavy monopod .	1
if you've found these reviews , you already know this lens one best canon products out there . i not bite version , i not found myself ever wishing i ; this lens everything it hyped up performs well low-light/indoor situations . i don't think it weight big deal . i really don't any problem carrying this lens around day -- my hands or bag -- even 1.4 extender attached . it feel bit heavy but i don't mind , neither you when you see results later . i've used this lot shooting professional baseball it landed me front page ink several times . my mind , i could get 1.4 extender this lens give myself 70-280 range , which pretty adequate most sports nature photography , considering 300 f/ 2.8 it friends much , much more expensive . lens works basically just fast sharp , my opinion , 1.4 f/4 , although some may debate this . flip any baseball or football game you see this lens around neck most every pro . if you swing price , enjoy it ! my advice continue reading up this or similar products , although i found most everyone agreed , this one finest lens around . it one makes people stop stare wonder who you	1
this probably canon best value mid/long zoom . i got this same day i purchased my 30d ... ef-s 10-22 ef 24-70 2.8 . talk pleased ! no regrets whatsoever . this lens just screams quality . images just pop out you . if you're considering f/4 model ... take hard look this one . add hood ( cha-ching ) ( yikes ) $100+ tripod ring value this lens really shows . it bit larger heavier but look what you gain ! if you're one those considers sweet spot lens stopped down step or two just look where puts you f/4 compared this one . focus speed nothing short " holy mackerel that fast ! " sure , you could spend few more bucks get version ... but frankly , me least , if it important i'll using tripod anyway . hmmm , just took shakes out equation . all all , great lens decent price	1
my cousin wife professional studio photographer who occasionally lends out her lenses me clothing / lifestyle photoshoots ( i've pretty active this area some time , just now starting go full digital ) , i've used f/ 2.8 four or five times this one best lenses i've used . period . shooting wide open allows you retain high shutter speeds night shots , well get very interesting vibrant long shutter shots ( crowds , freeway night , etc ) . when shooting action shots , tripod mount get way zooming focusing , but it removed easily enough . i personally just purchased f/ 4.0 , which , coupled relatively wide max aperture shooting either 1600 or 3200 my 20d , should nicely , but i still rate 2.8 high up my list	1
excellent product , easy use , great edging cards making trims cards craftwork . i can't wait experiment it	1
i've my d70s year now , haven't regretted it second . controls laid out logically , everything hand . dual control wheels make adjustments fast accurate . i personally love optional grid overlay , i no excuses horizons aren't horizontal . wireless flash system great , though you buy sb-600 or sb-800 get full benefit . this camera bigger heavier than d50 d80 , which my opinion positive thing .	1
d70s minor update original d70 introduced 2004 , few new features slightly larger lcd . it still great camera , but expect it replaced new d80 , which 40 percent more pixels , 2.5 -inch lcd , additional useful features old price d70s . so , you probably save little money still purchase sophisticated digital slr if you wait until prices d70s stabilize new , lower level . , say , $600 , this camera would incredible bargain . d70s shined one best cameras its class since its introduction . example , it 1/500th second flash synch speed ( found no other camera but d50 ) so you keep ambient light under control avoid ghost images . its autofocus fast accurate , features both single-autofocus , continuous-autofocus ( tracking action ) , novel " automatic " autofocus mode switches af-s af-c required . if you no nikon lenses , get this camera 18-70mm kit lens , which very sharp versatile , rather than more limited 18-55 lens . you won't regret it	1
i bought this grip year ago after shooting homecoming weekend my school , central michigan university . pain it saved my wrist able shoot sports vertically without hang my hand over top my camera huge relief . recently though , after year solid use , i've problems it . there days my camera suddenly say my batteries dry - after charging them day before . i've checked , my grip not part series recalled similar problem . i actually removed grip , batteries , restart camera correct problem . -- this big problem middle sports match -- however , grip great addition 20d/30d models . it not same feel using 1d , but it close you're going get . $150 , you can't go wrong vertical shooting doubled battery life . it also simply evens out weight camera , especially heavier l-glass lenses your camera	1
i recently purchased this use my 550ex . if you use alot flash event photography , you want this your kit . it expensive , but i think it worth every penny . it keep you changing aas your strobe it quickens recycle times nearly instant . you shoot bursts still get proper flash exposure . you attach strap sling it over your shoulder or slip it your belt . mounting my 20d just not comfortable . it gets way hand-grip	1
yes , it overpriced , just like any specialty item . yes , screw attachment bottom camera useless . but when you need fast recycle times or hundreds flashes go , cp-e3 invaluable . you strap case light stand or flash bracket , coiled cord length adequate these uses . i use elegantly compact really right stuff flash bracket which no place attach cp-e3 , so battery back without its case slips into my shirt or pants pocket . case could also strapped your bel t.t he unit little weighty 8 rechargeable aa batteries aboard , i'd hate see how many pieces this plastic gizmo would break into if i dropped it hard surface . top tunnel strap hang it something , strap should included . i made loop some hiking boot shoelaces ( which i also make zipper pulls ) i hang it knob light stand when shooting studio set-up . without short recycle times cp-e3 allows , my 580ex flash would gotten only one shot my daughter bowing after playing her piece piano recital . instead , i got three . decide yourself how important kind thing	1
i bought this because i needed top recycle speed my 550ex flash unit without spending huge bundle . i shoot karate demos my eos rebel digital , lots fast action rather large space ( meaning many full power flashes ) . digital rebel set iso800 mode flash set +1 stop exposure i adequately cover action basketball court sized gymnasium . using this battery pack 2000mah aa sized batteries ( 6.50 set 4 walmart ) i've taken over 400 pictures no slow down cycle speed . this particular pack uses 8 aa cells compatible lithium ion cells . older version this unit used 6 cells i believe , not compatible lithium ion batteries . unit very simple . box light it , space strap ( though none included ) slide out battery tray locking button course connector coiled cord hooks into side flash unit . i'm sure they it reasons resistance , but cord kinda short , thus limiting you where you hang battery package . if your tripod socket free they include screw designed mount battery package bottom camera ( kinda useless if you ask me ) . battery box comes fairly nice padded nylon case includes velcro strap , this what i use hang battery package camera or bag strap it works fine . eventually i'll get around finding something i use strap worry me less ( 8 batteries this thing it bit heavy trusted velcro if you ask me ) . unit works way it intended but i think price exhorbitant hunk plastic , price should half what it . if you can't go all-out buy top end rechargeable battery or true professional ( what they used call 512 ) battery package then this enough most us	1
my first lens . very sharp solid build . canon dr amazon gc , you get it lower $400 !!	1
like canon ef 17-40 f4l usm , this it sister $100 cheaper boot ! excellent images f4 ! outstanding images f9 . lightweight combination canon 5d . even lighter more compact combination canon digital rebel t.t he only gripe i purchase optional expensive tripod collar ring . ring add bit noticeable weight . since i am not steady shooter , i upgrading canon ef 70-200 f4l usm when it available november this year . least tripod collar ring should fit newer weathersealed lens .	1
this lens i use most often . it unbeatable portraits low-light photos indoors etc . it very sharp relatively light small . i also found it useful aerial photography . i used 50 mm 1.8 but upgraded because i like extra low-light power 1.4 ( which i often use ) one-touch usm manual focus distance scale ( which just nice-to-have ) . said , 1.8 great lens too	1
lens great ! i'm using it my eos 20d , shots beautiful . wide open setting ( 1.4 ) , depth field amazing provides absolutely outstanding boquet . this lens definitely worth difference price over 1.8 . boquet much better . little advice : avoid using auto focus your camera when using this lens ... its too easy catch any little thing front or behind what you intending focus , you see difference , just small difference depth . manually , lens provide you perfect shots every time ! its well worth extra few seconds make sure shot composed correctly	1
this monopod very sturdy easy set up . i looking monopod capable handling weight my large canon lens ( over 3 lbs ) , this one job very well . i mainly use it taking soccer pictures , so far , i'm very pleased . i highly recomend it	1
price went up !!! great value money spent . buying " ball " attachment better adjustability . got some great steady shots 48x digital zoom canon s2 i	1
this camera so user friendly versatile ! 8 megapixel resolution , pics sharp clear ! honestly best camera i've ever !! great buy cost all us non-professional users	1
kodak p880 remarkable bargain produces astonishing photos . its 8 megapixels zoom lens it operates like more expensive slr . quality photos , even highest zoom , astounding . anyone interested easy operate , high quality camera , this one	1
this third 8 meg sd camera i tried - it only one without using tripod indoors gave me sharp , crisp pictures most time . zoom smaller fuji or panasonic , but color saturation sharpness heads shoulders above others . excellent camera shoots jpg , tiff raw	1
this filter works great . i used this filter nikon 18-70mm lens produced excellent pictures . i yet experience any flare this polarizer . great polarizer great price	1
this review personal experience . i recently picked up d200 replace my d70 . this past weekend i took photos my sister wedding . i shot full functionality using lcd review every shot using nikon 18-200 vr lens . over course wedding reception i took 295 photos fine jpeg mode reviewed them while shooting . end afternoon , i still battery life left very likely could taken 100 more photos . given features capability d200 , i absolutely no issue many photos . i pick up second battery back up soon someone some stock . i could not agree more previous reviewer . if you not personal experience this product , there no need attempt review it based hearsay or something you might read elsewhere	1
this excellent camera . i upgraded eos 20d which also great camera . i upgraded couple reasons . first full frame sensor . eos 20d 1.6 crop factor which effects your lenses overall focal length . eos 5d you get true focal length your attached lens . just like film slr cameras . awesome ! one problem i've noticed full frame sensor eos 5d it huge . when you changing lenses this sensor picks up every little piece dust , dirt fibers like vacuum . i'm constantly cleaning sensor blower . i also bring it canon service center . just remove some dust off sensor my blower could not remove . canon service center very far my home . ( very annoying ) . i never experienced this problem eos 20d . but , images you get full frame sensor far superior smaller sensor eos 20d . other reason i upgraded larger lcd . 2.5 ' lcd screen nice plus . images look bright sharp . overall i love this camera . build , features image quality excellent !!!	1
con:i've own this now 6 months , i shoot weddings portraits . i alot tests , especially picture modes . well don't waste your time these , their all bad , theexception landscape . you'll just end up using standardmode best all arround shooting . venetting accure arround edges , mostly low light . worst all color ballance or white ballance auto mode . what ever reason it hard time . my d60 out performs it here big time , not sure why . so you may shoota grey card get your white ballance more accurate . pros : quality pic excellent , color saturation awsome . blow up 2'x3 ' excellent detail , no noise . i've found focus mine real good , no problems here . ease use after learning curve becomes easy , just read manuel . conclusion : i would buy again except awb problem . now i owned both d60 10d neither seemed this problem bad . i use this mode when doing weddings because i'm always move go one differn't light sorce inbetween shots ( tungsten daylight ) . i still think canon best alway buy their products	1
i switched digital rebel xt . since i already l-glass lenses , i didn't run into problems 5d " exposing " cheaper lenses . 17-40mm really shines full sensor ! burst rate simply astonishing . missing flash doesn't bother me , heck it $3000 camera , i don't expect built-in flash . i speedlite 580ex , which course wonderful itself . i also battery grip which i recommend , well rs-80n3 cable release . image quality superb overall - 5d really shines high iso numbers - more so than even 1d what i've read . even 1600 there hardly any noise . it allows you take great , crisp photos low light where other cameras would require flash . camera also quite light while very sturdy same time . 3 fps might bother some , but i prefer incredible burst numbers .	1
i bought canon eos 20d digital slr canon ef 75-300mm zoom lens take photographs my children various sporting events . magnification factor this lens perfect variety sporting events including lacrosse , basketball , swimming gymnastics . focusing speed very good capturing action shots . i highly recommend this lens affordable general purpose zoom lens	1
i just begun my interest photography this first zoom lense i ever bought . lense provided all i could ever ask . i just got back zoo kids photographes excellent	1
all reviews this lens all true . it great lens . i love quality it . however , if you like take door photoes don't very big rooms , you might want consider 50mm f/ 1.4 . i mostly find my self backed up corner trying take picture home	1
i recently bought this lens amid trepidation 85mm focal length would overwhelm 1.6 crop factor my digital rebel xl . my worries needless : just step or two back subject plus some getting used telephoto perspective enough turn this lens into most effective portrait lens i . when attached my eos elan 7n film camera , however , lens really truly comes into its own , full frame 35mm slr delivers entire focal range this lens . focused image incredibly crisp compared any other non-l grade lens . i agree this lens deserves red ring courage around it , like lenses . this glass absolutely essential very short list affordable lenses , should give many non-affordable ones run their money . solidly built too , old-fashioned no-nonsense look it . i highly recommend it	1
monopod functions i hoped price excellent dea	1
it everything it reported . it works very well . we take it every trip we take	1
my mom lost her usb cable her digital camera amazon always everything i need so i order it her	1
item just what i needed hook my camera my computer start downloading photos . it unpacked , plugged working less then minute	1
we received our usb cable promptly . you know kodak usb cables special they not fit any other regular devices uses usb cable . these usb cables kodak only . product itself turned out everything it represented	1
great case . small , soft , compact , extra space batteries . however , hole camera strap center , which means if your camera strap attaches anywhere other than middle camera , it doesn't line up this case . minor detail . example , strap a530 near top camera , so strap goes out side case , unless you pull it sideways go through case hole .	1
i never take my uv filter off my lens unless i am going immediately put different filter . there basically two camps out there , those feel you should always use uv filter protect your lens dirt scratches those feel it waste time only degrades your image . well , i tried going without one awhile then dirt started build up front element my very expense lens . although you clean front element lens , i feel much , much safer wiping my comparatively cheap uv filter time time again rather than chancing any actual lens damage . i think nearly unquantifiable loss image quality you may suffer uv filter , it well worth extra piece mind it gives me	1
this also correct lens hood new ef 70-300mm f4- 5.6 usm lens . 4 stars because it $40 piece plastic should included both its intended lenses . shame your cheap ways , canon	1
i am generally pleased this lense , if i could only carry one lense my digital rebel , this one i would take	1
this great lens if you need shoot wide angle very low light siuations . if you don't need lens this exact purpose , you'd better off spending few extra dollars either 16-35l or 24-70l . these two zoom lenses cover 24mm ( more ) very reasonable 2.8 good results . they won't bag shot shadows , but they handle any decently lit scenario ease . if you just own 1.4 prime lens , 35mm 1.4 much more universally well-regarded lens than 24mm 1.4 . 50mm 1.4 1/3 price either just amazing my opinion so long you don't need wide angle . only reason i give 24mm 1.4 4 instead 5 price	1
i've bought several lenses adorama , two which include new 300/ 2.8 other , this 500/4 . all their deliveries prompt well packed . i zero complaints them . i dealt john ( green , i think his last name ) via email . i highly recommend them . this lens , it incredible . wide open it creates wickedly sharp subject against wonderfully soft background ( good bokeh ) . af very fast . this lens extremely good still af when used 1.4 converter . ( af works up 5.6 .	1
good advice other reviewer picture . said i three these really wouldn't want without them . these clean my camera screen glass my lenses without scratch every time . my opinion almost must your bag ! good luck	1
this really handy lens your bag . i added this lens my collection several months ago , i haven't regretted it one bit . i took trip montana august used this lens photograph ton wildflowers . i also using 70-300mm telephoto lens 24-70mm wide angle lens heavily , but most my favorite shots trip taken this lens . autofocusing very quiet since it usm powered , but it often tricky get right focus if you're doing extreme closeup . this general facet macro lenses , so you'll probably find yourself using manual focus 90% time or more . manual focus this lens quite excellent though , responds well fine adjustments . it also quite easy me handhold it , long i decent amount light or pop up flash . all said , this nice lens grab after you decent telephoto lens , if you like photographing small things . otherwise , you might look into getting some other lenses first , i.e. wide angle , fisheye , etc . ( unless you already own all them :-))	1
i use it my s70 .. it works over 10meters ( thats right ! ) back too , so i am very happy it .. i bought it today so maybe it improved now ..	1
i purchased this camera year ago ( summer 05 ) . definitely great upgrade over original rebel , although new xti larger screen which one aspect this camera not perfect . there other sites perform more comprehensive reviews this camera , but after year mine still working perfectly	1
i am 67 years old started out photography kid contact printer box camera . i all types cameras over years , mostly 35mm film canon slr . i too bought all sorts these 5-7 mp point shoot digital cameras before returning my true love , slr . i my digital canon rebel xt month now i can't keep my hands off it . it lacks nothing . although kit lense good , i bought 28-135 canon zoom lense image stabilizion produced stunning photo it . i love way you use 7 points focus , i mainly use only center point focus lock never get out focus picture . i guess nicest thing me i now don't urge buy every point shoot camera paraded out qvc or hsn " wonderful " new feature like " low light or non-shake . " this canon every good feature known universe you can't outgrow it . its camera let you good you , it won't hold you back . battery life great , built flash good but i bought 430ex that even better . i never figure i'm wasting money buying accessories this camera it my main squeeze many years come . i always missed my 35mm canon slr now feel i old friend back again , only much much better . believe me , you can't go wrong getting this camera , its beyond description ...	1
when i bought this camera sales people tried get me buy battery . they said one came it would only good 20 minutes . now i bought alot items my lifetime , 20 min battery camera just doesnt seem like very good " business " choice . so i said no . so i got camera , charged battery until light went green ( which sucked because i wanted play it right when i got it ) started taking pictures ( oh i also got 2g cf ) worked great .... so i planned go up mountain take soem scenery shots . keeping mind what sales person told me i pocketed charger just incase . well , 6000 ' , 300 pictures , 5 hours later camera still running strong , still 200 shots left trip home , battery life indicator hasnt budged off full button . so all all , i think battery life great , now i see if your taking say thousands pictures all row you may need but just going trip shooting few pictures every stop point , original work fine . quality photos ..... i love them	1
best camera i ever owned . easy use even all features . don't afraid buy this one	1
i bought this little camera recently amazon . thanks tremendous service speedy delivery , amazon . sony dsc-w100 terrific . it very simple operate . menu system well-organized easy understand . inserting battery memory card snap . zeiss lens system yields incredibly sharp photos even automatic setting . flash pretty powerful , too ! i took some shots rather dark restaurant , pictures came out really nice clear . macro function superb crisp , well-defined details very close range . powerup time this camera fast well time shots . there very little shutter lag , you usually get picture you intended get . autofocus little slower until it " finds " target perfectly certain situations . but this no big deal compared older digicams . i like able switch quickly viewing pictures replay mode back camera mode simply tapping shutter release button lightly . you quickly ready picture . camera not miniature weighs nearly six ounces , which not extremely light -- but comfortable carry or place purse or pocket . i also canon digital rebel xt , this little camera take sharper pictures . course , you not versatility slr , but it great everyday camera take you all shots you would otherwise miss . i highly recommend this camera recommend purchase amazon . update : i now used this camera video mode . wow . it produces incredibly sharp videos fast frame rate looks terrific our television . multi-purpose cable supplied camera allows usb 2.0 audio/video hookup . you must decide what zoom level before you start shooting your video because once you start , you cannot zoom out . if you 1 gb memory stick pro duo you take 12 minutes video . i want get 2 gb pro duo stick which allows almost 25 minutes video . this would ideal take when you want switch still video shots keep your video shots consistent consecutive order . you must use pro duo stick high quality ( fine ) video mode	1
bought one these year ago . works same canon battery i got camera . i alternate canon lenmar batteries haven't noticed any difference	1
product top quality product . filters work excellent my canon powershot s2 . without doubt , worth every penny , especially considering price i paid it , which least half where i saw it listed other places . very happy purchase	1
backpack holds all my stuff extra room . only thing i thought i ordering bag not backpack based picture shown . backpack little heavy side me but i like it	1
i've many camera bags over years , this one seems fit bill best . it roomy - carries camera body one lens , plus charger , extra batteries , manual , memory card , room lens or two . i wouldn't say it would able hold more than three lenses . we recently took this trip st. lucia it held up well , even repelling some unexpected rain . we very pleased . size perfect - roomy but not overly bulky . i'd highly recommend this bag !	1
bag suppose hold two cameras , i rebel two lens cant fit them lens filters extra batteries . i recomend you buy bigger bag it not meet billing here . might good couple point shoot cameras but not sl	-1
battery pack arrived quite quickly , we delighted paying far less it than manufacturer charging product works just fine	1
i received short amount time just what i needed . this way i am able my camera turned almost full day using this backup nothing worse than needing little more time able get enire family reunion unable add last family into scrapbook but this cured it all	1
sure beats price buying polarizer , uv 2 nd filters individually	1
i this bag year recommend it . i use it all time . it great walkaround bag . first time you're place where you want get your camera quickly or don't want put your bag down you'll appreciate sling design . just aware long mountain hike you may feel weight your shoulder after some time . my only error getting 100 - i should gone 200 , plan so . i like keep my lens hood place which requires little more room . i'd also found i need little more room non-camera things . word all-weather cover - great feature . few weeks ago i bermuda walked beach 25 minutes away . just i arrived soaking rain began didn't let up entire walk back . if i hadn't able pull cover my equipment would soaked . now i wouldn't buy bag without one	1
this my first review amazon because i've bought products never really felt like they deserved review . i would say i thorough search bag would fit me . i nikon d50 18-55mm lens 70-300mm zoom lens . i originally large nikon bag pain carry around . it inconvenient carry access my camera . so when searching bag i wanted something compact , easy carry , could hold my gear neatly securely , my camera easily accessible those moments when you want take quick shot put it right back . i went camera stores tried bags , looked all over internet reviews finally came across lowepro slingshot 100aw . it everything i looking plus more . besides able hold my camera gear , it able hold my battery charger , cleaning supplies , extra batteries , filters , built all weather cover . even all packed i still space my wallet , cellphone keys , thus freeing up my pants pockets . great thing bag it able give me extra stability when taking photos when bag slung around front me . bag so well designed there no worry bag opening up all your expense gear fall out . opening where you remove camera straps prevent it opening all way accident . all all i am very satisfied bag . i would recommend it anyone but if you more than couple lenses your photography arsenal i would upgrade slingshot 200aw .	1
i love this remote . i find it very convenient take self portraits night time long exposure shots . unfortunately i lost remote during my trip smokies still no clue how where - might slipped my pocket hurry . i ordered second one now . it so tiny you not feel weight or volume your pocket or camera bag . i wish it strap/thread or hole so it attached key chain or camera or etc .	1
i use it my nikon d70 , am very satisfied it . i most often use it long exposures , taking picture include myself , taking pictures my 6-month old daughter , who stops acting naturally when she notices i hold camera , so i place it tripod , take pictures her .	1
i agree all others comments this lens . it works great but it big , heavy attracts attention . when i say it attracts attention , i am not kidding . i airshow taking pictures lot other amature photographers . my 100-400mm lens , however , attracted attention local newpaper reporter who interviewed me . however , i bought it use my 20d airshows i honestly say i am not disapointed . it well worth money . i also bought cheap kenko 1.5 teleconverter kicks . while converter isn't " " grade , i am pleased results autofocus still works which i understand not case canon tcs . those looking big zoom lens you want , you ulitimately going wind up buying this lens .	1
reviews this lens web mixed some showing soft results , particularly 400mm . this likely due wide variations sample lenses . i decided take chance seem gotten lucky . my copy , just received amazon ( build date oct 2005 ) produces fantastically crisp contrasty images my 20d all focal lengths 100 400 . it almost magical . images much sharper using same f-stops than those 70-200 2.8 lens 100-150mm virtually same 200mm . even wide-open 400mm this lens quite sharp . 400mm , i've compared very nice canon 400mm 5.6 prime lens , without 1.4 teleconverter . images virtually same extreme sharpness contrast if zoom stopped down just one one-third stop ( e.g. zoom 6.3 , prime 5.6 ) . 1.4 tc both lenses manually focused but produced outstanding clarity no perceivable loss quality . focus swift true this lens really works ( not hum like 70-200 2.8 ) allowing handheld shots 1/100 sec 400mm . it may canon quietly improved this lens since recent reviews seem much more positive than those few years ago . some folks don't like push-pull zoom but it works great me allows very fast composition scenes . lens same size 70-200 2.8 but seems lighter better balanced . given razor sharpness its images 100-400mm range , this seems like perfect single lens solution nature bird photography . however , it big white so it may not best candid people photography .	1
i purchased lowepro slingshot 200 replace tamrac adventure 7 backpack i recently returned amazon . i spent quite few hours researching bags use sightseeing/hiking initially purchased tamrac bag b/c its similarity ( style ) regular backpack . recent " series " purchase encouraged me keep low profile when transporting my gear . while tamrac bag certainly looked part , its functionality left something desired . adventure 7 held my entire kit , which includes : canon digital rebel xt , ef24-105mm " " , ef50mm ef18-55mm " kit " lenses , ex580 flashgun various hoods/filter/etc above lenses . now bad part , once strapped into its normal position , only way access your gear ( adven . 7 pack ) fully remove backpack , place it ground , unzip zipper fully , then remove/replace camera/gear you desire . this proved very cumbersome while rocky terrain " great falls " national park va ( near dc ) , fact , there times when i gave up few nice photo opportunities simply b/c getting camera would too difficult . i own lowepro holster , but going route , i would limited my ability bring alternate lenses/accessories . after some additional research , i decided try slingshot 200 . let compare tow some key points : gear capacity : nearly identical both bagsadditional capacity : tamrac trumps lowepro , it nearly double useable storage capacity , great bringing snack , your keys , etc . styling : again , tamrac winner , looks like standard backpack , versus strange look slingshotfunctionality : backpack , tamrac much more comfortable , greater storage capacity even offers waist support strap longer trips . but , this comes cost accessibility . lowepro slides easily around front . simply unzip your camera right there . it also stable platform lens changing/cleaning/etc . summarize : hiking/walking/etc where you need instant access your camera accessories , lowepro slingshot 200 wins hands down . pros : instant access your gear , includes all-weather cover ( attached ) , nice attention details ( lens cleaning/protection cloth particularly nice touch ) , etc . cons : strange styling , not reversible ( only worn right shoulder ) , nearly impossible carry hanging one shoulder .	1
case opens partially side allow removal camera only . then after unclicking fasteners you unzip rest case allow access lenses . it makes it easy if you only want remove camera . you swing bag around while wearing it pull camera out without taking off pack . my digital rebel xt fits canon battery grip my macro lens attached , however it would not fit my 200mm lens attached . my canon speedlight flash not fit well lense section but fits perfectly separate section top portion bag . lenses all fit nicely allowing several lenses depending size them . i bought regular lowepro camera bag , but found it awkward place camera lens attached . this bag designed camera lens . if you search google images lowepro slingshot 200 you see what i mean side unzipping allow camera removal .	1
if you believer protecting your expensive lens purchase filter than you lot worse than tiffen filter . glass quality good price reasonalbe . filter cuts down glare adversly effect some shots out uv filter advertised . not much else say .	1
great filter price-no reason spend more . filter threads high quality , it possible stack filters if you want-not recommended , though , if you using it wide-angle , i am . no vignetting , sturdy filter .	1
this fantastic lens . it takes crisp , rich photos , large apperature makes impressive low-light photography , includes usm technology lightening-fast focusing . since i am only serious hobbyist , i can't yet afford quality canon lens ... but 2 years i perfectly happy leave this lens camera ( 10d ) . portraits , landscapes , indoor shots no flash ... it them all ease , photos look grea t.t his lens little heavy , combined my 10d weight certainly consideration . but me it feels well-balanced camera , i like substantial feel lens-camera combination gives . if you plan use flash , remember this big lens built-in flash may not clear barrel ( especially 10d , before canon redesigned pop-up flash ) ... might want think external flash head hot shoe . there lot glass front this lens , don't forget uv filter little extra protection	1
my all-around favorite lens canon eos system 50/ 1.4 . i find most time , most pictures i want take achieved using hte 50mm focal length , fast aperture allows me take photos low light . i bought 24-70/ 2.8 hopes getting high quality images zoom lens , lot my pictures weren't particularly dark places , flexibility get little wider or closer sounded appealing . i not disappointed . image quality produced 24-70/ 2.8 outstanding . great color , great sharpness . it might not make images quite striking canon 135/2 lens , but they very good indeed . this lens replace 50/ 1.4 ? no way . 50 lot smaller , weighs lot less , still much better low light shooting . but photographing events where you don't want lug around several prime lenses or go extreme lenghts frame shot better , 24-70 great tool	1
you buying quality not price . im amazed quality pictures i get my new lens . it seems i changed my camera new model ... totaly diferent pictures . i compared my previous cameras lenses wow ... i cant believe i thought i some great pictures my collection . i dont want use my other lenses anymore , i new standard my pictures . i say it " crazy " decision buy this lens because price , but this investment once you it you enjoy last many years . if you love photography really like go full detail you wont regret it	1
i already 2 smaller versions other lenses but wanted sure my efs 17-85-mm would snug bug its own pouch instead cheap felt sling thing . well , canon came through again its soft felt line lp1116 . this pouch thick same firm bottom made naugahide protects inside lens . cord strong silky doesn't open accidently way silky cord would . obviously we can't throw pouch around we careful but it really trick feels good your hand . moment i buy lens , i shall buy its matching pouch	1
i not actually taken this underwater yet , but it appears well made similar quality other cases . it keeps theover-all size camera/case down size could fit into bc pocket . downside , it only limited functionality camera through available buttons . you zoom telephoto , change camera , playback movie mode shoot picture . you cannot any setup functions while it case . regarding stobe , sony makes one looks little cheezy . there " universal " strobe sea life ( sl 960d ) fits , but fiber-optic trigger just taped onto flash camera . i'm waiting how this works . one replacement o-ring comes case-replacements sony outrageously expensive . color-correcting ( red ) lenses $100 sony , but not needed if you use strobe . ( unless maybe shoot movies ? )	1
i lot research picking out camera wish i known this camera before purchasing nikon p3 ( wifi ) . i happened receive refurbished sd700 right before our honeymoon took both test them out . what better place than kauai take some great shots ... so , after first day shooting i came conclusion canon better camera hands down !!! matter fact it best camera i've owned i'll never get brand again . there several things set this camera apart others : 1 . picture quality scene modes ( beautiful beach floral mode)2 . picture quality auto ( true sign good camera)3 . 4x zoom ( unbelievable - best feature ... took pictures lighthouse mile away looked like i right front taking it . i also used camera binoculars see mountain goat wimea canyon picture unbelievably clear)4 . battery life5 . user controls softwarei really can't find anything bad say this camera . i didn't get chance even read manual before our trip figured out all " bells whistles " fairly easily . point shoot camera , this canon delivers professional quality like no other ! definitely great purchase	1
i love this camera . it everything you'd want compact point shoot camera . perfect taking pictures my toddler . fits your pocket starts up split second . never miss " kodak moment " .	1
obviously , i am enamored nikon d80 . one who extensively used d100 , d70s , d200 , i curious how d80 would " shake out " comparison these fine cameras . answer it very well indeed . most obvious improvement d80 over d70s d100 upgrade 6.1 10.2 megapixels -- same its " big brother , " d200 this not major issue many users , 6.1 mp image ( uncropped ) looks essentially exactly same 10.2 mp image . however , if user intends crop images post-processing , larger amount resolution becomes importan t--t he more megapixels more detail when images cropped . shooters wildlife , example , appreciate additional resolution d80 , it often necessary photograph wildlife distance then crop image cause subject dominate frame . other very obvious d80 improvements larger viewfinder larger rear-lcd . these very welcome improvements , also borrowed d200 . viewfinder wide , bright , literal joy use . combined 11-point autofocus system ( basically same d200 although some differences options ) viewfinder makes d80 powerhouse camera moving subjects , or framing subject places other than center image . autofocus fast sure . i literally never use manual focus d80 -- autofocus just too good not use almost every conceivable situation . 2.5 inch rear lcd bright vivid -- joy use . this too , mentioned above , borrowed d200 . menu selections d80 closely track those d200 largely pretty intuitive anyone who somewhat familiar nikon system . few nits . first all , d80 not selection focus-priority continuous focus mode . this unfortunate , such option ( present d200 ) allows fast action shots using continuous-focus surety subject , fact , focus . happily , this absence ( which i predict hope nikon correct later firmware revision ) not huge loss . i shot hundreds images fast-flying birds using continuous focus d80 images almost all perfectly focused . user trust d80 continuous focus mode , focus priority or no . nikon chose equip d80 sd cards rather than cf cards . why nikon this mystery many us d80 clearly upgrade wonderful d70s , which uses cf cards . further , d80 fantastic backup camera d200 users , d200 , course , also uses cf cards rather than sd cards . cf cards would more logical choice my opinion d80 . fortunately , cost these media dropping so fast this less issue than it would few years ago . d80 sucks up power lot faster than d70s . 2.5 inch lcd entails higher power use price . most users want own spare battery . ergonomics , d80 terrific ! i just finished 8 day stay maui , hawaii , during which my d80 literally always me . weight camera low , its bulk , reasonable . there no digital slr i would rather carry extended period than compact d80 . placement various controls excellent , pretty intuitive . quality d80 body construction standard nikon-prosumer grade , which say , excellent albeit not heavy-duty metal-body d200 . overall , d80 destined become one great nikon cameras find place users all over world	1
i recently test drove d200 impressed useabiity camera . it almost perfect . when buying i opted d80 because it very similar feature-set less cash . which meant additional money lenses . ok , it doesn't shoot 5fps or alloy body weather seals , but it sensor useability . it light , quick joy use . changing settings such iso , wb flash almost easy d200 . this fine camera . it uses sd cards - much more preferable than cf my opinion . worth every penny	1
this camera awesome ! i upgraded my d50 better sensor more mp . wow - am i amazed increase quality . say goodbye digital look . extras lot fun i've only begun play . b/w various filters name one . very worth money	1
first all i not consider myself anything more than very beginning photographer !!! so i not go into anything technical . i leave people who know more than i . but what i am international traveler . i simply got tired coming home fantastic trips " snapshots " . i wanted someting much better , boy i get it this camera . i looked d70s since i very small hands , i could never feel comfortable holding it . this camera smaller without small . i only taken photos locally , but this time year leaves changing it makes good start . built editing features ( filters etc . ) wonderful work . i would highly recommend this camera anyone who wants something more than " point shoot " snap shots	1
camera more advanced photographer very detailed instruction booklet . takes excellent photos auto mode . memory chip included not near big enough	1
i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
this item good companion use battery backup ; i recommend this item all people using digital rebel xt . this battery long life after full charge , very light small piece you accommodate into any pocket or bag , i'm very satisfied this purchase	1
i am certainly happy i bought this filter kit . starting photographer , price right , i not noticed any quality issues . uv filter stays lens all times , it cheaper replace filter , than it scratched lens element repaired . light polarizer very handy , also works very well , cutting down greatly glare . i not yet occasion use warming filter yet . filter case nice extra , it fits right my camera bag , out way untill i need it	1
great kit ! i haven't used any filters before but i tell i'll using these quite bit	1
this camera case exactly what i looking . it fits my canon sd600 perfectly . it fits like glove- not too big , not too snug , it not scratch lcd screen . it really cute nice punch color contrast basic black every other camera case out there . i've gotten lot compliments how cute it . i definitely recommend this product !	1
i love this product ! case slim enough carry around purse without taking up all room . red color fun , too !	1
i mainly use this when taking landscape shots where i want either make clouds pop or liven sky up some ( remember it works best 90 degrees sun . ) i also put it when shooting highly reflective vegetation or waterscapes would otherwise cause blown-out highlights . one other little secrete use this when shooting waterfalls since it allow you shoot slower shutter speeds thus increasing wispy waterfall look	1
this uv filter it job protect lens well . build solid ( metal construction ) . glass also descent quality . performance , it absorbs some uv light . uv light absorbtion hardly noticeable , probably sky 1-a haze filter version absorb more uv light than this lens which fine me . now , one problem which internal reflection . i've heard many people say it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out it not caused directly low light/night situation . internal reflection appear when there strong/bright source light comparison overall exposure ( surrounding environment ) . put it example ( which hopefully easier understand ) , when you take picture lamp during nightime light much brighter than surrounding area then you see internal reflection . you move position light closer sides/corner picture ( not center picture ) , internal reflection reduces finally dissapear ( if you move light far enough center ) . if light isn't too bright/contrast compare surrounding environment then there no internal reflection . but course most time , lamp nightime often very bright . but point i'm trying make internal reflection doesn't happen all time during low light or night time . additionally , internal reflection isn't only happening night . it also happen afternoon if you taking picture sun example . basically same rule above , how bright light source compared surrounding area , you move sun center photo near side internal reflection move side/dissapear ( also depending angle ) . but best way just remove filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you reduce occurence internal reflection identifying correctly when internal reflection occur then remove filter during those situation ( which not hard ) . i'm actually not fan lens filter ( any filter ) i think it only degrade picture quality we added layer sensor object , but i decided use them anyway all my lens . i would recommend everyone get one this filter if you don't any filter your lens yet .	1
this little camera may small ( great feature ) but it loaded this goodies . this my first adventure into digital photography i would recomend this one any first time user . very easy lots fun use .	1
i 580ex it works great . i hopeing it would work studio light but nope so dont try it . only thing you mindful distince flash subject	1
i this camera year now am very impressed . i used nikon 35mm slr all my life so i little hesitant going into digital . lugging around equipment became too much issue so i started looking . picture quality great even full optical zoom . i very rarely use digital zoom . most impressive ... camera taken 2 direct hits concrete ( 8 months ago ) still works perfectly !	1
i've this camera since just before christmas 04 . i purchased www.bhphotovideo.com $350 . i should waited until after holidays , because price come down . it great finally small camera . i often forget i even it me ( which i guess bad ! ) . over all pictures good . focus sometimes soft . it doesn't take good night photos , but takes great daytime pics	1
this bag great active photographers . it doesnt matter how you store your equipment because straps velcro , come off moderate adjustments . me my lifestyle photography leads me many times up highplaces my photos , i tried many different types bags what i needed . mainly shoulder straps this one best so far it keeps contents bag very well protected so far not affected snow/ice or mildew/rain i am very pleased would recommend this bag anyone who would want alot room everything they'll need more	1
i like bag . pleanty pockets pouches all my little small accessories . just wish it little better suited 2 cameras like i . but , everything fits ... comfortable haul around all day . nice pads straps secure it my back . well padded equipment . i'd highly recommend it anybody	1
i humped this thing around dc last week 7 hours , not worry mention . well balanced , i it full camera , 4 lenses , flash miscellany . i cut all extra straps off , just shoulder harness left . it looks good too . course , it great advertisement thieves so never let it out your grip .	1
i'll keep this short , i assume most tec stuff covered . i sold 350d get 400d(xti ) . 400d focuses better , better ergonomics , same size/weight , takes great photos . i tried nikon d80 , but it loses way too much detail iso 400 up . plus canon line lenses fits my needs better , cheaper , available . nikon costs $300 more ( canon discounted ) , nikon raw converter adds $150 . so true cost difference $400-450 . i'd buy canon over nikon same price due image quality , especially if you shoot jpeg . btw , if you afford canon lenses(the 25-105l 70-200l-any 4 ) amazing . one caveat , any dslr , these cameras not p/s best some post processing knowledge how camera meters/exposes , etc . i can't emphasize this enough	1
emphasis portability , canon digital rebel xti designed firs t-t ime dslr photographers travel enthusiasts . measuring 5.0 " 3.7 " 2.6 " weighing 1.1 lbs ., it large largest point shoot cameras one smallest dslr camera bodies market . its size source both popularity criticisms . if you large hands or heavier lens , it may feel too small . optional battery grip help , but some want something more substantial . visit store nearby find out yourself . package includes camera body lens cap , battery , charger , manual , catalogs , neck strap , usb composite video cables , cd-roms . you need lens compactflash memory card . there may some static energy packaging , so remove lens cap dust-free environment such bathroom prevent dust entering sensor . much promoted sensor cleaning system helps , but it best not get any first place . canon sells 4 versions xti : black or silver finish or without ef-s 18-55mm f/ 3.5 - 5.6 lens . black or silver largely personal preference , but most lenses , most accessories , all but low-end dslr camera bodies black . kit lens , it affordable introduction dslr capable if used exclusively f/8 or f/11 apertures ( soft other apertures ) . other words , lens not ideal shooting under low light . if you don't get zoom lens now , start canon ef 50mm f/ 1.8 ii . it famous top-notch performance very low price . due xti aps-c image sensor ( compositions multiplied 1.6 ) , this lens becomes 35mm-equivalent 80mm . if you budget good zoom lens , over 100 lenses , canon you covered . some canon popular zoom lenses include ef 28-135mm f/ 3.5 - 5.6 usm , ef 17-40mm f/4l usm , ef-s 17-55mm f/ 2.8 usm , ef 24-105mm f/4l usm . if these too pricey , third party vendors such sigma tamron make canon-compatible lenses less . their focus not nice canon usm but they generally outperform canon lower-end lenses . tamron sp af 17-50mm f/ 2.8 di ii ld aspherical ( if ) sigma 18-50mm f/ 2.8 ex dc af 17-70mm f/ 2.8 - 4.5 dc macro popular among budget-minded photographers . 10.1 megapixels image sensor , xti benefit sharper lenses . although increasing resolution over same image sensor area increase noise , canon improved sensor technology maintain low noise floor high dynamic range . performance wise , there very little criticize . great example canon trademark smooth , high contrast , saturated , low noise . noise remains low even iso 800 . it said shooting raw equivalent getting extra exposure ( 1.0 ev ) it help you maintain usable details acceptable noise iso 1600 . low noise gives xti bit excuse missing in-body image stabilizer . according canon , lens more effective location image stabilizer , especially telephoto . that true but i think feature would've nice . consolation , xti mirror lockup reduces vibration caused mirror movement . my sole performance criticism metering mode . it includes only partial not spot metering mode ( very useful when shooting high contrast scenes such candlelit birthday cake ) . perhaps more problematic evaluative metering mode , which occasionally underexposes images 2/3 ev or so . some criticized xti " plasticky " build . except metal lens mount , exterior largely made high quality engineering plastic rubbery paint . if you drop it , it probably crack or break , but it sturdy well made . flipping power lever , it starts up almost immediately ready use . much promoted auto sensor cleaning kicks when powering up down . most dslrs , there virtually no shutter lag it focuses split second ( especially when using usm lens ) . continuous shooting mode fast memory card , it take 10 raws or 27 jpegs 3 frames per second . raw images 10 mb each , so get speed 2 gb or larger memory card , such sandisk ultra ii series . replacing both 1.8 " lcd info display 2.5 " high resolution lcd led backlighting . it displays current camera settings , photos memory , menu . thanks greater real estate more refined user interface , xti very intuitive pleasure use . minus 10% lower battery life , which merely adequate begin . xti 95% crop 0.8 optical viewfinder displays 9 auto focus points , shutter speed , aperture , more , but misses iso speed , white balance , metering mode . overall , xti viewfinder more than adequate but pales nikon d80 larger more comprehensive one . highlights software package imagebrowser ( mac os universal binary ) , zoombrowser ( windows ) , digital photo professional ( mac os universal binary windows ) . imagebrowser zoombrowser easy-to-weight lightweight applications managing jpeg raw . digital photo professional considerably more powerful lets you use xti dust delete data feature removing dust its sensor cleaning hardware couldn't remove	1
amazing quality affordable price ( still not cheap tho ) . this lens takes great quality photos my daytime/outdoor performer . although i don't think equal 1 f-stop when it comes low light situations but it sure very helpful these high f-stop numbers	1
my first lens i'm sold . while i spend lot time - lot , this isn't small purchase - deciding this 24-70/ 2.8 , i feel i made right decision . first , i took into account what i actually shot . not what i thought shooting or wanted shoot , but what i really spent my time shooting . then i backed up looking past six months ' worth photos . me , this right choice . big decision wasn't over image quality - rather it max aperture . 2.8 vs 4.0 . 4.0 won . i absolutely love ! even higher speeds , rocks . ( it also eats batteries like hummer guzzles gas)ok , so shooting it dream . incredibly fast focus . wonderful fit finish . i could gush all night . if you're spending lot time trying justify it , don't . if it won't break your bank , it well worth it . if you're trying decide which lens , try what i . it made all difference me . what downside ? i'm ordering 17-40 today . lens bug bitten . next 70-200/ 2.8 . there goes kids college fund . : -	1
everyone gives this lens rave so maybe i should approach this terrific lens shooting pov . shooting wide open f2at 135 gives your pictures distinct quality you would never get zooms , there isn't zoom this focal length this speed either . few primes come close but they're nowhere near sharp wide open . af fast very accurate lens great feel 20d/5d/10d body even wo battery grip cameras . close up magnification . 19x . 21 therabouts nice bonus this lens , letting you get closer wo too your face tight headshots . i always felt photographers usually sweet spot when shooting certain things like some portrait photographers like distance 85mm gives them when approaching subject , turns out i'm liking 135 focal length quite bit headshots 85 torso head shots . one thing i like this 135/f2 combo there enough dof get most main subject view focus but background still blurred out . it really great when you want subject focus nothing else , opposed 85 1.2 parts subject could melt into background resulting images little too ethreal some tastes . couldn't you just stop down 85 ? sure but relationship foreground background would still different 135 . 135 f2 give result that juuust right . backgrounds just little more compressed foreground but foreground sharp but background gone . almost like you lurred background photoshop . but you'll never get same results blurring photoshop , one thing highlights would get muddied blur treatment ps while highlights stay clean f2 . don't just use this thing portraits , use it way you would use 50mm try frame such , again focal lenth wide aperture give interesting result . i basically use it candids portraits during wedding . fantastic lens , very sharp , very handholdable , focal length terrific portraits bokeh very beautiful , equal sharpness 85 1.2 or any canon $5k lenses . this probably best lens you get price , only lens i've used better saturation contrast 35 1.4 . downside : not handholdable 50 , 35 1.4 or 85 1.2 during low light situations due it focal length	1
i believe this one best lens $1000 . forget zoom lenses even if they . this lens far better than 70-200l my opinion . it very sharp f2 even more sharp 2.5 . zoom lenses you set f/ 5.6 better result f/8 match this lens . it very well built but not excessive heavy , come hood bag , but unfortunately , canon decided remove hard cases all lenses . combined tamron 1.4 teleconverter this lens provide very good optical quality par any zoom lenses 189mm focal length . yes i know i lost convenience 70-200 zoom lens . but i am really happy i decide change plan buying 70-200is 135/2l+ 1.4 . this not only saves me money but also let me get better pictures , especially wide open . better portrait lenses , like 200/ 1.8 300/ 2.8 , would cost several thousands dollars . trust me , once you play primes , you not like zoom anymore . i am also using 24-70l shoot my small kid . after using this lens , i don't like it anymore thinking change primes someday , only reason preventing me doing 1.6 crop factor digital camera . 35mm/ 1.4 become 56mm which really not good . order amazon free shipping even though it says not stock . they shipped mine 2 days this happened before even though item stated " stock soon " . pros : very sharp f2 super sharp start 2.5 . very fast lens f/2very good bokeh ( background blurring ) . overall extremely good picture quality good contrast/color . smaller size , less weight black color compare those white 70-200s . it lens : best build quality , fast/quiet ring usm af ftm . cons : no hard case . no inexpensive . effective focal length 216mm 10d/20d/rebel/300d which little difficult use portrait	1
i bought this keep dust iraq out my canon ef-s 17-85 lens . it fine job i've seen no noticeable change quality images i'm capturing my canon 20d	1
i searched researched lens purchase my canon rebel xti weeks because i knew i not want kit lens . i also not money spend 5 , 6 , or $700 dollar lens . end after reading countless reviews , ones implementing professional techniques ones using just opinion , this lens looked best value . money i really don't think you beat this lens . it focuses quickly , it really quiet while doing it , it sharp enough money . plus it full time manual focus , which really big plus lens this price range . only problem it little narrow side 1.6 crop factor rebel xti , but i would much rather deal than sub-par image . summary i would recommend this lens place kit lens anyone who doesn't money buy " " series lens . it really great value	1
i bought this lens replace kit lens rebel xt . i find this lens very good value , very good value . i also canon 28-135 3.5 ... find 28-105 lens very stong lens price . it might even just notch clearer then 28-135 but half price . it size nice light weight fits nice rebel since it smaller dslr . all all , great lens budet price but it dosn't act like it . fast focus , fair range , nice size , easy lug around . i would sugest this lens any one first my list someone who not wanting go crazy lenses extras their camera , just want simply get some nice pics without spending all their lunch money . also lens takes same size filters kit lens , so if you spent few dollers few filters kit lens your luck . i know i happy still use 3 filters i've already got .	1
i've my remote switch almost 3 months now . i love it . so far only feature i used remote switch it works flawlessly . if you want trip shutter distance without shaking 20d ( camera i use ) this what you need . i use it extension cord since i am generally 30 feet away camera . i am very pleased this purchase . no complaints this point	1
i somewhat surprised receive my tc80n3 only canon international warranty .... anyone else receive grey market version this remote control ? i ordered $1000s canon products amazon.com always received canon usa warranty card items .... not sure why this item didn't carry usa warranty . i sent several emails amazon.com regarding this matter . i'll update review when i receive answer satisfactory . please note : amazon shipping replacement remote ! i'll amend again once replacement received . control itself wonderful product but this price i expect canon usa warranty card . gar	1
i some dust spots my lenses , mirrors inside . i afraid use brush or cloth kits , since they could easily scratch . one my photography books suggested i use this exact air blower , so i thought i'd give it try . it simple tool , but it emits strong amount air i able clean everything off . even works well keyboards or other dusty spots	1
i owned giottos rocket air blaster 2 weeks now love it . i use it blowing dust everything : camera lenses , computer screens out computer keyboards . it made nice soft material allows it stored flat out way . additionally , it creates sufficient pressure force away most dust particles course requires no canned air , it works you pump it . i'll never forced air again	1
best feature this flash wireless e-ttl feature . two 550ex one work master one slave st-e2 both flashes off camera fired e-ttl . draw backs : price , no manual control slave mode greater light control , size ( this thing big ) . plus side weighs out negatives . it great flash	1
top line . works advertised . ttl , e-ttl . 4 double aa batteries . tilt , rotate head , soft lens built . control slave flash	1
this camera first digital me , only camera i ever enjoyed . macro setting gives amazing closeups bugs , flowers , etc . purchase charger some batteries , i've kept it going almost nothing . better get big memory card , too . silly settings like " color swap " " fireworks " fun play . my only complaint it slow recover shots , so you miss some action kids , etc . price , it can't beat . gramma	1
very quick delivery . product exactly advertised . very happy whole process product	1
i never take my uv filter off my lens unless i am going immediately put different filter . there basically two camps out there , those feel you should always use uv filter protect your lens dirt scratches those feel it waste time only degrades your image . well , i tried going without one awhile then dirt started build up front element my very expense lens . although you clean front element lens , i feel much , much safer wiping my comparatively cheap uv filter time time again rather than chancing any actual lens damage . i think nearly unquantifiable loss image quality you may suffer uv filter , it well worth extra piece mind it gives me	1
very small size ( fits my baggy jean pocket ) , fast startup , fast response when shooting picture . much easier carry around than my canon g3 . not well indoors when flash needed . lots red eye , much more than my canon g3	1
optics best i've ever seen . clarity great . abillity focus small objects only 2 " away allows great macro pictures . however auto focus much slower than most canon lenses , but i focus manually . this my favotite lens ever	1
i only wish i bought this lens earlier so i could using it longer . i am especially pleased short minimum focus distance - 3 inches . this allows you get very close small subject still fill frame subject . i no problems this lens i love it	1
i canon sd-550 . this battery works perfect it . i've noticed no difference charge time usage when compare original manufacterer one . except price lot lower	1
product great ! you should get it . usually , i'm skeptical abour getting generic brands , but this works perfectly	1
incredible piece equipment almost give away price . i no complaints this camera surpasses what i expected	1
there already tons reviews eos 300d ( digital rebel ) but i want share my experience camera , so i keep this short . i bought this camera 5 months ago i am love . i not new photography or slr , but new world digital slr . i previously used ancient minolta x-570 , " pro-sumer " 35mm film slr vivitar 35-105 standard zoom lens . first foremost this camera takes excellent pictures , very high quality no distortion i seen . this camera particularly good beginner dslr because there so many options use learn . but until you ready take advantage all featues , you use this just like point shoot . battery life excellent so far : thought i would suggest getting extra backup long days taking photos . i also quite happy kit lens , which i wasn't sure i would like since it not versatile lens i using my minolta . but kit lens proved great learning tool : i able take some great shots , while also learning what kinds other , better lenses i would like add my setup . ** only issue i problem sandisk 2gb cf card . after 300 shots , camera froze stopped responding card . i able salvage most photos after fact , but don't risk it . if you're serious enough spend this kind money camera , spend little extra money sandisk ultra ii line high-speed cards .	1
i've owned one these cameras four years now , i very pleased it . it light , small easy carry . it takes beautiful pictures -- very sharp , good colors . pictures look good even when you blow them up so big you see individual pixels . it actually my second camera like this . first problem usb port side camera , i took it back store traded it new one . this camera also problem too , after two years , button back needed making settings stopped working properly . but still , considering cost camera quality pictures , i buying one . it worth it .	1
i tried several digit-cams say you cannot find better camera this price . pros : + great value , low price+ easy handling+ portability , light weight+ great fuji colours , good auto white balance+ fast shutter response , close film cameras+ control over exposure , flash pre-programmed white balance+ it uses aa , great battery life+ changig images playback mode doesn't take hours+ excellent prints photoscons : - images noisier than competition ( but they more expensive also)- images too much compressed , therefore less detail , no control over jpeg compression ( but this same most fuji models unfortunately)- no control over iso- low resolution lcd , too dark low-light- no optical zoom ( but this price it ok)- camera cheap feel it ( but again , this price it ok)- weak flash outdoor night shots , but enough smaller room shots- flash recharge time takes few seconds , camera freezes ( but this same most fuji models unfortunately)- it uses expensive xd-cards- sluggish zooming panning playback mode- no sound videoi highly recommend this camera beginners or those who doesn't want spend more digital camera . i've read many negative reviews due it bad photo indoors . okay , it not canon g3 . first i thought same , but then set controls manual , set exposure up highest value then shot picture . end result much better than full auto mode . so my advice indoors low-light set exposure manually , you'll glad you i promise . colours well balanced , prints come out great , no matter how noisy images , you won't notice photo paper . this model now out sale , but if you find second-hand one good price don't afraid buy it , it excellent buy	1
this lens great those indoor regular nothing fancy shots . i recently used mine indoors restaurant distance or close up range perfect .	1
this lens works really fast . it great lens . captures color real depth detail my canon 20d camera	1
i initially canon s1is ( just 3mp , 10x optical , cf card ) needed upgrade same i visiting disney , la . s3is ( 6 mp , sd card ) delivered gusto its image stabilization higher iso modes . i full video reasonably good snaps disney parade during evening darkness ( switch highest iso dedicated iso button ) : 1 . amazingly low jerkiness due image stabilization . here course better than s1is . 2 . snaps came allright even maximum zoom - if there slight blurs , you maybe use software like coral adjust . others said here , yes , tripod best , but who time or patience set it up . 3 . even many disney fireworks snaps came out ok night mode maximum iso setting - though course tripod would helped darkness here , sure :) 4 . best value price . nov 2006 , nice deal would getting this camera within 350$ amazon . two things here : 1 . i would not buying videocam i planned earlier , s3is vidoes suffice most situations - sending videos afv instance . 2 . last point , i would recommend waiting 3-4 months till 4gb sd cards come into 50$ range . but others mentioned before , please least 2gb card . look amazon or fry i 35-40$ deals 2+ gb cards	1
i bought one when it first came market back may . half year 5,000 pictures later , here some my comments : - it great digital camera its own class . " class " i mean one should not compare it dslr because s3 not one . so not expect it overcome " shutter lag " easily , although among other dc ( digital camera ) i used , shutter lag s3 greatly improved -- degree i feel comfortable taking photos very fast pace , e.g. , catching flying birds . ( however , only good dslr completely eliminate shutter lag s3 not dslr . ) one also should not compare s3 " small " point-'n-shoot dcs . s3 not small those -- it won't easily slide into your pocket , unless your pocket relatively big loose ( like mine ) . but slightly larger body brings great features none small dc offer . - big optical zoom ( 12x ) . 12x great combined canon imagine stabilization , s3 turns into powerful large zoom camera superb imagine quality . my recent trips included shooting ( cameras case you wonder ) wild wolf yellowstone national park . this little s3 came out only one capture animals great distance , other " big guns " professionals carry . feature eliminates hand shake great effect i could shoot 12x low light still get quality photos . i also highly recommend " tc-dc58b tele converter lens " s3 ( or s2 ) which gives you 1.5 zoom effectively make s3 18x zoom ( equivalent 600mm lens ) . check how much those big telephoto lens cost ( close 10k ) ... - excellent video shooting . again feaure one almost never finds any other dc or dslr . s3 takes dvd quality video stereo sound , not just video clips most dc . this little ( almost ) pocket-size camera now forces our digital videocam into early retirement . - many other great features . however those more or less standard one always try argue some other dc may similar or better features . i won't comment those . summary , s3 great small-size dc . its superb lens offers big 12x zoom , two technology canon pride . it also offers dvd video shoot stereo sound -- this feature alone save you digital vidoecam . one suggestion -- get big sd card if you want shoot video too . i 4g sd card i think 2g must . also battery life excellent . it uses 4 aa-battery , which seems lot odd beginning . but it comes handy because long you get aa battery you never worry power . typical dslr , if battery out you day unless you find power outlet recharge ( your charger you ) . i one small complain . menu button back camera location where my palm presses body . sometimes i raise s3 i see menu viewfinder because my palm pressed it strong enough trigger it . press needed i lost several shots because this . i other dslr quality lens . but i always take s3 me any trip	1
my 2 year old really active my point shoot camera cannot keep up him . i also don't like washout look when i uses flash . so i researched which slr best meet my needs , mainly catching fast action , candid moments low light photos without flash . canon 30d comes up top list . it best high iso performance its class ( better than nikon sony ) . when i combine 30d fast zoom lens ef-s 17-55 mm f/ 2.8 , result amazing . i stop any action daylight , capture every candid expression my 2 yr old fast burst mode , take indoor or night photos without using flash or tripod . portraits also excellent sharp image beautifully blurred background ( bokeh ) . even dimly-lit decors disneyland haunted mansion came out superb when we went there halloween party night , without flash or tripod . this really important factor me buy this camera , taking pictures tripod not option when your subject active 2 yr old . but you need good lens make this work well . if you use cheap kit lens , then it probably not matter which camera you pick . remember these 3 all very good cameras small differences image quality you see reviews apparent only when they use best prime lens ( not kit lens)and crop pictures magnify details . sony very good choice if you budget don't need low light performance ( use flash save money ) . nikon more custom function than canon , it really good canon . they both their strength weakness . canon just happens slightly better high iso performance suits my need better than nikon . fair , i should mention nikon d200 tops most reviews camera year , beating canon 30d overall . but d200 bit too advanced amateur like me , better suits someone more serious photography . d80 like " mini " d200 , but slower . so it really boils down what you really need how much you want spend . shooting low light without flash need good high iso performance , good fast lens ( wide aperture , usually expensive ) , image stabilization . if that what you want , canon 30d ef-s 17-55 mm f/ 2.8 not disappoint you	1
this camera incredible . i ordered it my husbands birthday he just begining figure it all out . there so many great features . one best how quickly you take digital pictures . our other digital cameras lag time shots , but not this one . pictures crisp it easy even novice like me use . i highly recommend this camera if you want take digital photography next level . it one best	1
though i am not qualified write quality filters , they seem doing job pretty well . finish good they fit well 58 mm canon lense my rebel xt . lense cap goes right over it so it doubly protected . small pouch hold three filters also big help keep them safe easily accessable	1
hoods offer several benefits photographer . primarily hood shades lens stray light may result unwanted discoloration or hazing image , or appearance lens flare . shading your lens helps improve contrast image quality . hood not required eliminate these problems , any item used shade lens provide same protection stray light . hood convenient it built offer protection while ensuring it not inadvertently find its way into your image . photographers often state protective abilities hood reason one . this hood solid petal shaped offers limited protection keeping moisture wind blown debris off lens element . when place , hood protect lens impacting solid objects . shallow petal shaped , this type protection also limited . even if protection limited , replacing damaged hood usually cheaper than repairing lens easier replace . this hood manufactured canon 28-135mm f/ 3.5 - 5.6 ef normally not included lens when sold new . amazon often suggests purchasing one your lens , worth considering . since hood wider than lens ; it easily stored attached reverse position . this doesn't add length lens , but make it wider inch . inch may not seem like lot , but tightly packed camera bag , it huge . this lens itself isn't unusually wide so extra inch may not problem . while protective benefits exist , they secondary limited . i find impact hood my image quality more convincing reason use hood . considering impact image quality low cost compared my other camera equipment ( except lens case ) , purchasing hood money well spent . pros : improves contrast image quality reduces lens flare problems offers limited protection lens cons : takes up more space your camera bag store lens	1
this camera lot modes you use . it very good resolution optical zoom . 12x optical zoom you click awesome pictures , specially live performances sightseeing trips . 5 mp resolution more than enough , otherwise pics become just too big fit one screenshot . you also panoramic pictures it . big advantage windows recognized this camera soon i connected it using usb cable comes it , transferring pics pc becomes very simple . only two complaints - flash recycling time should lesser , sd card comes it only 16 mb , which hardly enough 7-8 pics . you buy 512 mb or 1 gb sd card separately . also , batteries come it not rechargeable , so you buy charger batteries well , which not so expensive . but these drawbacks there s3is also . overall , this camera gives very clear pictures worth buying if you happen get it decent price .	1
i got this canon camera back may my birthday my husband . once i got it home it very easy learn use . i actually not even used all features yet ... because there so many . this my 3rd digital camera 1st canon ... i say i stick canon now ... i use always like kodak but canon much better . i print off pictures using my kodak printer everything still looks great ! i love canon so much i just bought canon camcorder ... i hope it just nice their digital cameras . i highly recommend this camera families ... i used it live action after you get hang image stabilizer everything turns out well ..... i feel i use this camera while when it time upgrade camera i stick w/ canon ..	1
i started looking earlier version this flash when i saw upgrades 430ex i didn't hesitate order it . it what i've needed take my photos higher level . i shoot two magazines now instead taking my studio light into every shoot , i still carry it me , i use this flash instead it makes world difference	1
this very nice flash unit integrates well powershot pro1 camera . i appreciate zooming strobe tube match lens focal length well ability bounce flash off ceiling softer effects . i should purchased this flash when i first got pro1 camera	1
i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
this good zoo lens . it not heavy or noticeable something like 100-400 lens . also , 3 stop smaller size weight this makes great backup lens 100-400 trips or when i just don't feel like carrying around 3+ pound lens all day . so if you don't want deal cost or size series lens this one next best options	1
i am lifelong photographer i purchased this camera january . i taken it several major trips . it wonderful performer . i many 11x14 enlargements i received terrific feedback . quality this camera cannon optics not disappoint . price right now replacement out .	1
i am just hobbyist . this big purchase big step me get into this level camera . i still haven't mastered using it yet , i've it few months . it wonderful job taking pictures . if you right lenses , it take some most beautiful pictures you've ever seen . again , i'm just hobbyist/enthusiast . i use it take pictures work , too . i highly recommend getting couple very good lenses go it . don't go cheap lenses canon , tamron , sigma , etc . make this camera . yourself favor get nice zoom - spend some bucks . you'll happy you . camera itself pretty easy use if you leave it auto , but that like buying race car never shifting out first gear . auto settings great , they wonderful job , but you so much more if you learn use camera manual , av , tv , or mode . it allows you so much more creativity you'll amazed difference . 30d came out right before i bought 20d , i would probably buy it price now , but i'm very happy my 20d	1
my kids competitive tae kwon . i now used camera my wife gave me one year ago several tournaments . it able stop action take great shots even low lighting . now , we tried it when we went skiing it also worked great glare conditions snow . i bought monopod worked real well stabalize i use software called photofinale crop share photos . one year into usage i am still looking forward each chance i get play this " toy " . next options : battery grip , flash diffuser , extra remote flash ..	1
i concerned when i ordered this filter previous problems reported here . but , i hurry needed two these vacation . there absolutely no problem product . both filters sealed perfect condition . could packed little better shipping box , but arrived good condition . no problems photos taken this product	1
i never take my uv filter off my lens unless i am going immediately put different filter . there basically two camps out there , those feel you should always use uv filter protect your lens dirt scratches those feel it waste time only degrades your image . well , i tried going without one awhile then dirt started build up front element my very expense lens . although you clean front element lens , i feel much , much safer wiping my comparatively cheap uv filter time time again rather than chancing any actual lens damage . i think nearly unquantifiable loss image quality you may suffer uv filter , it well worth extra piece mind it gives me	1
this it . i upgraded sigma ex 2.8 80-200 . i should spent money nikon first time . sigma very nice lens less , good alternative , but if you want it all , go nikon . leave your tripod home when you get this glass . i don't know how this compares , but i'm shooting hand held 1/30s shutter full zoom ( 35mm equivalent 300mm ) . vr phenomenal , wide aperature delivers beautiful blur , overall fit construction flawless . tack sharp images too	1
i buy this uv filter protect my kit lens(18-55mm ) , so far so good . i am using canon rebel xd . if you just want get cheap uv protect your lens , buy this one	1
after overpaying fancy camera store , i happy purchase identical filter amazon fraction price . these filters give you piece mind , protection sand , fingerprints baby spittle	1
i recently purchased this camera it very easy use takes nice pictures . i bought case put it so i could keep screen getting scratched . go out find generic camera bag fit it . they so much cheaper than canon camera bags . only thing this camera i would like change i wish it battery life indicator .	1
this tripod total shock ! i amazed quality , stability portability . heavy duty denier carrying case great bonus . level quick release also welcome surprise . this best $9.00 i ever spent photography accessories .	1
previous review not completely correct . problem not product but description what amazon.com put up canon cpm-e3 battery magazine . it battery magazine canon compact battery pack cp-e3 not camera battery grip . i think product itself great thing , it lets you switch whole magazine 8 preloaded batteries instead replacing batteries canon compact battery pack cp-e3 . previous reviewer should not judge product incorrect infromation given retailer	1
canon 1ds mark ii not list $ 11,999 . body only it lists around $ 7,500	1
i purchased this camera online one month ago amazon here [ ... ] i taken pictures alaska florida washington i love how mark ii captures images imho more clearly than any film slr could ever take . best camera i every use	1
this cleaning pen just advertised . i used it daily basis since i got it , it never failed great job . i use this visibledust huricane blower , combo unbeatable . great value price	1
i bought this pen my boyfriend his new canon digital rebel slr , but you could use it almost anything lens . it got small brush one end swipe away big stuff , round felt tip other cleaning smudges . he finds it very useful it fits right hiw camera bag	1
i got this cord mainly macro work so i could use long macro lenses my flash without deal lens shadow picture . it also very nice able control direction lighting placing flash above , below , or beside subject . red eye also almost entirely reduced moving flash further away camera body , so this cord helpful portrait work . it could little longer , but longer it gets more difficult it would pack it small spaces , so all-in-all i think they pretty good job . it works fine , if you want all your flash functionally , but don't want it hotshoe , this good choice	1
only problem i live holland things sent my daughter us then forwarded since you don't ship overseas . any hope may change future	1
i needed replace lost s4oo we year . looked sd series thought them too small comfort . there such thing too thin handle comfortably . s500 , like s400 , just right size . big area back thumb so you even one-hand hold it . try any sd . pictures excellent hand-held . not nikon n70 film slr good , but plenty good enough any snapshot purpose . bought one last new s500 available newegg abd very , very happy it	1
this flash unbelievable , most time i use built-in filter because it so powerful , great value money . just takes some practice getting it adjusted correctly i said before it really throws light out there . highly recommended	1
finally able put some money aside get new flash my d50 . i looked less expensive sigma flashes , but end i decided go nikon . i figured i spend money camera , i'm going get better flash . used it other day took some great portraits my daughter . flash worked like charm . it better than camera pop-up flash . pop-up flash comes handy if you can't or forget bring main flash , but it really nice extra power sb-600 . if you think your going lot indoor photography ( birthdays , holidays , etc .. ) this great flash . if you children , best bet portrait photos ,,, nikon d50 , nikkor 50mm 1.8 sb-600 flash . great combination very good price . we haven't take kids their pictures taken studio . this set-up , you take great portraits your kids their own environment more convenient time you kids decide . no traveling nice cloths worry	1
i waiting 3 years any manufacturer market camera similar specification canon eos1 . exploration health , safety environment advisor , work takes me middle desert or oceans . wait 35mm film quality , speed picture taking ( 5 frames per second barely enough capture dolphins - hence 8 + fps eos 1 desired ) . there parallel wait image stabilised 28-300 zoom lens . let cut story short . if i want camera bring holiday , it would not this one - battery charger too heavy bulky ; instead i would choose eos20d without hesitation . but hundreds failed 35mm film frames i decided not wait any longer but buy eos1d mark ii because 1ds mark ii not fast enough 4 frames second . 35mm cameras , after few seconds shooting , i would run back inside cabin ( ship ) change film . if there large enough memory card eos1dii , there no need . this camera built seals against environment ( so 28-300mm lens ) . instead scared running out film , now it easy keep shutter button pressed while panning ( hoping ) dolphins their jumps into air . 28-300mm lens attached , there no need change lenses either . dolphins riding bow wave ship could captured 28mm while those further away could caught 300mm setting . it disappointment battery not lion but older nimh . but any photo gear requiring battery it wise spare , whatever substance . i just wish canon package small travel size charger instead standard one which very bulky . it connections two batteries ( yet it could only charge one following other ) but most people would happy using one battery while other one charged . you just try convince some airport officials let you plane above kit , binoculars , laptop , mobile phone , gps ....... ext . hard disk .... hand luggage . work , i am committed therefore bear weight troubles hauling hardware . but holidays , i would choose eos20d built-in flash because who would want lug around 3 kilos all day plus flash gun possibly tripod ? camera gets 4.5 stars but battery charger lets it down . why just 4.5 stars ? one beauties i thought digital slr not anything processing , just transfer images computer . wrong . . jpg straight out camera not sharp enough . post processing required . why ? why necessary when canon s60 ( which i use different assignments ( underwater housing )) doesn't need ? defeats point . jpg file 5.5 meg when 1.5 meg s60 looks sharper straight out camera ? still , there raw if standard output not suficient . incidentally , eos1dsii also produces 5.5 meg . jpg those also require post processing . those us who not interested working longer than necessary ( me ) 16.7 million pixels would seem bit wasted . i am still waiting camera which produces sharp . jpg files in-camera without post process , shoot 8+ fps sensor size equivalent 35mm film . meantime i shall learn shoot raw files post process . also incidentally , sensor size eos20d smaller , which means although itself lighter than eos1d series camera , carry around extrawide lens not my idea fun holiday . magnification ratio eos1dii 1.3 whereas eos20d 1.6 . this means i could still travel reasonably light ( compromise ) 1dii 28-135mm lens attached . sure it possible use stitching but more time spent computer time precious . any regrets ? none what-so-ever . it state technology moment . benefit using digital , it doesn't matter if you shooting iso 100 all day . come night if you want shoot rig moon backdrop , just change iso 1600 without bother " pushing2 film developing . it beauty when lens attached . you'd need when there machinery vibrations ship moving swell ! good job canon . now you need shoe horn more capable cpu ( process images in-camera ) , fit 1dsii sensor into this one or this motordrive into 1dsii you may persuade me part more cash .	1
i cannot say enough this camera ! moment you pick up box , you know you quality . construction materials used top notched . contents box found elsewhere , so i won't bother details . charging battery full takes 2hrs . if you memory battery repeated charges without complete depletion , you recondition battery included charger . it just takes 8hrs . while many lament fact no li-ion battery included , canon seems anticipated needs professionals field . one also option plugged into ac outlet not dependent batteries . reading manual takes bit time . camera endless customizable functions which overwhelming times . not it should deter you , but one rarely need all those functions anyway . using camera not seem too difficult . many functions need use two buttons , which may take some getting used . navigating through menu confusing initally , but improved time goes . autofocus speed responsive sharp . shooting high iso ( #62 ; 1000 ) minimal noise . looking some my pictures taken 1 fluorescent light room iso 1600 , appeared if flash used . photos my black lab incredible considering ambient light high iso . camera always ready go . if you manipulating within depths menu heirarchy , want suddenly take shot , just press shutter button , compose , focus , shoot . its quick responsive . incredible ...! some may wondering sizes pictures . jpeg 4 sizes range 1 - 2.8 mb ; raw files 8.4 mb . one take average 800 - 1200 shots full battery charge -- assuming one capacity hold it . prints my i9900 outstanding . cost pretty penny then some . also consider amazon authorized canon reseller . many rebates require you purchase authorized reseller eligible rebates . also , some internet deals camera not authorized resellers . overall , very impressive camera . cost many may prohibitive many . eos 20d may more cost effective alternative , but i not regret my decision one bit	1
this what i discovered when i've used my brand new 1d markiinwell , i say i am truly impressed this camera . friend mine got his month ago , so i played it little bit , but since i got mine thursday , i really gotten explore many features performance differences beween this camera 20d i upgraded . used few original 1d cameras , 1d mark ii , 20d battery grip 5d , size weight this camera really doesnt bother me ( i heard so many people complain size weight before ... ) i actually really like feel 1d mark ii . there only slight difference original 1d mark ii feel , but if you hold them side side you notice it . autofocus absolutely stunning . used 20d year half , i forgotten how nice it those 45 highly sensitive autofocus points ! soon you pick up this camera hold shutter button half way down , you realize why this #1 choice many best photojournalists . body construction highest quality i ever seen camera , but course very similar , if not identical other 1d series cameras . compared 20d 5d though , this thing just feels solid . stunning feature , course , speed which 1d mark ii capture images ... 8.5 frames per second ! just 1d 1d mark ii past few years , this camera holds its own all other cameras its class , 22 frame raw bursts 8.5 frames per second . i hardly ever shoot jpeg , but i test it found 48 frame buffer quite impressive . packing two 2 gig sandisk ultra ii cards ( cf sd ) i capacity 450 total shots . screen , course , fantastic , blows any nikon camera menu image review quality out water . 1.3 crop factor certainly improvement over 20d 1.6 , bigger sensor definitely yields better image quality low light due lower signal-to-noise ratio . overall , color reproduction , metering , exposure sharpness all much better than 20d . since i love wildlife photography i able get 75% more caption information than i ever my pervious camerasthe camera performs great studio , images beautiful , would expected . i yet make any photographic prints this camera , but i'm sure they look stunning .	1
canon three digital cameras $ 2,500 + . 1ds mark ii , 1d mark iin relatively new 5d . i chose canon over nikon ( which i've shot most my photographic life ) because canon more impressive suite lenses . here decision process i went through . most products , it comes down how you'll use it . all them tradeoffs . 1 . megapixels . more pixels - few caveats - translates into image enlarged ( cropped more tightly)with less deterioration . 1ds market leader 16.7 mp , 5d comes 12.7 mp 1d 8.2 mp . if you're commercial art or magazine photographer 1ds probably makes sense . if you're wedding photographer , 5d probably sweet spot . practice , however , difference pixels these cameras not make appreciable difference most people . 8.2 mp , you make 11x17 print 200 pixels/inch without any enlargement beyond camera native resolution . up size , you certainly won't see much difference prints three cameras . said , higher megapixels other cameras gives you more extreme cropping lattitude . 2 . full frame . 1ds 5d full frame - means sensor camera capture view scene you're accustomed seeing your 35 mm film camera . 1d most digital cameras what called field view crop factor ( fovcf ) . 1d , it 1.3 . what means both viewfinder image sensor don't capture everying lens " seeing " - it crops view little tighter . result : your lenses effectively 1.3 longer . 70 mm lens becomes 91 mm lens so . because camera effectively " cropping " edges image lens produces , it also tends eliminate softness or vignetting appears edges some lenses . whatever camera you use , what you see viewfinder still what you get , it doesn't affect pixel resolution image . my 300 mm lens 1.4 extender 1.3 fovcf effectively 546 mm lens - getting into birding territory . ( if you're switching film digital , some your lenses may may no longer fit your needs focvf . your 35 mm lens no longer really wide angle 45 mm . ) 3 . durability . this most important me , though it may not someone who doesn't shoot extreme conditions or expects replace their camera two years . both 1ds 1d sport complete metal bodies , sealed against weather shutter last least 200,000 cycles . 5d - very solid camera - designed 100 , 000 , not weather sealed more plastic components . 4 . weight/size . what solid , metal body giveth durability it taketh away weight . those who prefer camera heft , these it . many people , this big drawback . 1ds 1d 43 oz ., or almost three pounds just body , without big battery . add battery you're 54 oz . 5d just 29 oz . 31 oz . battery . 1ds 1d , built-in vertical grips , also more than 2 inches taller . if you're looking something less obtrusive easier carry around , 5d it . 5 . speed . there reason 1d camera choice photojournalists , sports many bird photographers . it shoots smooth 8.5 frames per second , compared 4 fps 1ds 3 fps 5d . most day-to-day uses , 3 fps more than adequate . using both , i'd say 1d autofocuses bit faster , too . 1d 45 autofocus points , compared nine 5d . 6 . price . give or take hundred here or there , 1ds $ 7,200 ; 1d $ 3,900 ; 5d $ 3,000 . price determine whether you get 1ds or not . if you afford it , go it . otherwise , other features - or possiblity buying more lenses instead more camera - make your decision . what i decide ? first , i looked how i'd use camera : photojournalism , travel wildlife photography . higher fps not important me durability autofocus speed , so either 1d or 1ds would . end , i decided i'd rather spend money lenses would not obsolete next new improved camera . ( i bought 300 f/ 2.8 close difference price . ) so , i went 1d mark iin . if my camera generating some good cash flow or my wife didn't need new car , i'd probably gone 1ds . i'm very happing decision camera . most people most uses - general portrait , landscape travel photography - 5d probably way go . ( or perhaps next greatest camera canon announce later this year .	1
since this my first digital camera , i really can't compair it others out there . however , it everything i need it more features than i make use ! i've never problem it	1
yep , it extends eyepiece out little bit ... which helps those us noses not smudge lcd display ... but it also distorts view annoying way . i use mine occasion ... but not all time	1
my take this lens it " " quality optic fine , non " " package . there nothing else market compete it ( nothing all ) , it produces supurb images . it isn't f/ 2.8 lens , but it close enough most uses . competition tamron full stop slower , not sharp , awful dim light compared canon 10-22 lens ( sorry , tamron fans , but tamron lens isn't even playing same ballpark ) . i use this lens 30d body , i always keep it hand if i'm doing any indoor , or tight group photography . it perfect solution perennial problem not enough room capture all kids birthday party one shot because your back up against wall . this lens just get your toes into picture widest setting , yet delivers tack sharp , colorful , contrasty images . auto focus spot , silent , fast . it must lens active amateur , or any pro using 1.6 crop factor camera . you simply can't beat this lens anything available market today . beng said , not try convince yourself this make good " walkaround " lens . it isn't . even max length , it far too short live your camera standard lens . you need this lens , even if you don't know it yet , but it should not your first lens , it only used 15 20 percent time . those times , it performance simply cannot equaled any other zoom lens 1.6 crop factor camera . you amazed quality this lens . it rivals performance modern prime lenses , presents bright viewfinder image , delivers goods tight situations . this not casual assessment , nor canon " feel good " moment my part . i developed my first bw contact prints 1964 , my own darkroom age 9 ( my parents concerned :)) , avid photographer ever since . small , medium , large format cameras lenses passed through my hands over years , canon become my favorite small format brand . still , canon builds some trash lenses should avoided . 10-22 usm not one them :) . before you go out buy this lens , you should already own ef-s 17-55mm f/ 2.8 lens . king 1.6 crop factor standard lenses , includes awesome canon feature . it end up mounted your camera 80% time , keep you smiling after every shoot . get lens first . then , get 10-22mm lens . then , let your imagination run wild , plan serious telephoto lenses future . trust me or not , two lenses mentioned above provide you photographic tools astound you . get them your kit soon you afford them . little warning either lens .... some here argue point , but either lens , get good quality uv filter multi-coated both sides , built extra thin avoid vignetting wide lens settings . good filter cost little less than one hundred dollars , cost up one hundred forty dollars . minimum brand would hoya pro 1 multi coated filters , ante goes up there . everything else garbage , including canon " sharp cut " filter costs less than fifty bucks . no kidding , no conjecture . if you use cheap filters , you never see what your lens really . ever . no doubt many respond claims their twenty dollar filter works just fine , but they simply don't know any better , never used their expensive equipment it full potential . it akin chevy owner passing judgement mercedes benz . chevy might feel real good , but until you own mercedes , you just no clue . bottom line .... make sure quality your filters exceed quality your lenses . yes , hundred bucks pop 77mm filter , it hurts , but you never regret it . also , amazon not stock lens hoods all non canon lenses . price stupid high those hoods , but they make night day difference picture quality . whenever you order non canon lens , find web seller who hood stock , get it right now . again , you never regret owning i t.t hat it my review/rant . buy this lens . buy 17-55 f/2 , 8 first . buy lens hoods both . toss any " kit " lenses came camera trash bin ( where they belong ) , very happy .	1
many great things already said this lens , i support them ! my copy delivers outstanding sharpness ( nearly par my 24-70l ) even * wide open * ( rare wide angle all but finest german manufacturers ) , great color , very little distortion ( many objective tests revealed it probably " best breed " ultra wide angle ) , impressive contrast . surprisingly , build quality not bad : tight fitting mount , damped rings , no jiggles or rattles . if i forced offer ( slight ) negative , it would bokeh lens somewhat " marbly " ... however , when shooting subject oof area differential high enough make bokeh component frame , then subject likely going demand far more attention than bokeh ! ;) fine lens , canon : definitely worth premium over sigma tokina rivals ( both which i sampled before purchasing this optic )	1
i've my d70s year now , haven't regretted it second . controls laid out logically , everything hand . dual control wheels make adjustments fast accurate . i personally love optional grid overlay , i no excuses horizons aren't horizontal . wireless flash system great , though you buy sb-600 or sb-800 get full benefit . this camera bigger heavier than d50 d80 , which my opinion positive thing .	1
it learning curve , that sure , but wow ! this camera worht every penny , far more stable then comparable canon rebel , product comes better lenses . quality glass matter	1
this excellent add-on close-up lens , not confused relatively inexpensive 1-2-4 sets sold aftermarket accessories . this double-element achromatic ( color-corrected ) lens made canon recommended lenses range 50-135mm focal length . it very sharp clear no color fringing . " 250 " indicates maximum distance subject 250mm main lens focussed infinity . actual lens power 4.0 diopters (+4 ) . it 58mm outer thread so you add clear filter ( uv or skylight ) protect lens surface . i am using it canon a620 required adapter , it produces outstanding pictures excellent detail sharpness .	1
i got this lens go wider 20d . i wanted go wider so i got 5d . started shooting events this lens i learned 580ex couldn't give me enough light dark . used lens during day . terrible problems lensflare . hood showed up edges pictures ( wide ) . went back 24-70l my primary lens . when this lens works circumstances right , results stunning . i'm trying use two flashes get power use it night , again terrible flare problems . whenever it matters i go back 24-70l . i just don't all these problems i t.t he problems 16-35 lens appear wide end . 35 lens operates well but that not what i bought lens . i love lens but it lens gives me most frustration worry . wish it cost less but what you	1
we dedicated thumb drive use digital photo frame we download our digital pictures computer . then we simply plug thumb drive into usb port digital photo frame follow menu instructions select usb port thumb drive pushing couple buttons digital photo frame . slide show pictures we view approximately ten feet away very good resolution . it great family gatherings received many positive comments our guests .	1
picture quality better than i expected . you still can't see picture sides , but straight it good . interface load my pictures very simple . i would like few more options available , but simplicity purposes , it works great	1
i love new digital canon . only problem it not nearly tough it film twin . i camera less than month when pop-up flash quit working . canon people great , very helpful , but i'd rather not send brand new camera back factory . photos , however , wonderful . film quality most part - printable enlargable . ( it would probably better use camera tripod when using 300mm telephoto but i hike it , so just remember steady it before taking wildlife photos .	1
i'm really impressed , i bought sd-110 year ago quick small digital trips . i never planning take it diving . housing really impressive , i've 4 dives month i waterproof case ( wp-dc10 ) it works great . i so excited try it out i went water full memory card . i got down 35ft took my first picture " memory card full " . it easy navigate all buttons i able delete while following my buddy . taking pictures fast moving fish doesn't work out range flash 1-3ft . my deepest dive so far 109ft off monterey coast , i worked if it 10ft water	1
recently picked up hobby digital photography i not aware nuances importance some accessories . back " day " when shooting 35mm film i could barely afford cost processing - let alone what i thought fancy accessories . well - some reading trip alaska my canon digital rebel xt - i learned , appreciate , importance lens hood . i bought rubber lens hood ( not lens specific ) local camera store totally unacceptable - then bought lens hood my canon lens amazon . it works great - no flare - no vignetting - it makes lens look pretty cool too ! i would suggest hood all your lenses never shooting without - obvious - it saves front lens bumping damage which important longer lenses or tight quarters like shooting photo excursion boat full other people all jockeying shot ! amazon service prices - usual - fantastic although i hate wait things - i am usually happy i when i order here . happy snapping !!	1
when hood reversed lens , it blocks zoom ring tremendously when 17mm . it not end world , but you're probably better off storing this bag , not lens itself when not use	1
i've used canon eos 10d 5 months now i'm absolutely thrilled it . eos cameras extremely comfortable hold handle . auto mode , camera produces correctly exposed , sharp photos . unlike my canon powershot , camera takes picture very little delay after depressing shutter button . creative zones , you set aperture priority take , example , selective focus shots , or use shutter speed priority set slow shutter speed take some good blurring shots . auto focus quick accurate , though how much camera how much lens i not know . i never use manual focus mode . pop-up flash works great lighting subject shadows or back lit . i now find it bit frustrating use my film camera ; i'm addicted viewing my shots spot . i canon eos a2 film camera i purchased 1995 . since i'm familiar eos system canon system lenses , i chose 10d over similarly priced nikon prosumer digital camera . i like my canon cameras so well i bought canon digital elf my sister canon powershot a80 my mother . both reportedly excellent cameras . 10d , i've used canon 50mm/compact macro , tamron 28-200mm canon 15mm fisheye lens . because difference way film camera this digital camera operate , you multiply focal length lens 1.6 figure effective focal length when used digital camera . so , example , 15mm fisheye lens effectively 24mm lens 1 0d.i bought 1 gig imb microdrive storage card allows me take 400 high res jpg or 160 raw format files . if you shoot auto mode , camera only capture jpg format . if you shoot manual mode , you select jpg or raw format . if shooting raw format , ensure you software program , such photoshop cs , open raw files . know not all developing printing shops accept raw format . but many image libraries only accept raw files ( or high resolution tif scanned slide ) . raw format files , i've found many my shots require bit exposure adjustment , but this simply matter moving slider bar photoshop cs . when you first open raw file , you get adjustment window allowing you play exposure , tint , saturation , white balance more . you even simulate warmup filters such . very cool stuff ! i bought extra battery take trips . one battery typically lasts me 2 days shooting , long i don't much reviewing my shots through camera monitor . unless you need quality 1ds immediately i would recommend getting 10d because technology moving so fast quality 1ds available current price 10d near future	1
i this camera 4 yrs now - i take it all my business travels . whenever i get chance go out weekends , i take this camera my sony camcorder my backpack , roam streets new city shoot pictures . pictures i shoot this camera just awesome - no matter whatever experiment i it . most useful features : 1 . aperture control depth field preview - lets focus foreground blur background2 . shutter speed control upto infinity - lets you control amount time which shutter kept open3 . it pretty rugged , dont try dropping it :) i used it shoot pics ' maid mist ' niagara falls i almost thought i going lose it . but it worked liked charmnegatives - bulky , but you get used it , it always gets attention - cost developing film - what i these days just get photos cd , then develop only those photographs good . why this camera better than digital camera ? - if you spending $200 digital camera , i feel slr way far too ahead any digital camera price range - if you spending $1000 digital camera , digital slrs very mature today - worth buying . ideally , i would buy this slr , take this whenever i really want take good photographs , then i would also want $100 kodak digital camera casual shots . this would mean ideal combination . if you buying this slr , you also consider buying film/photo scanners ( available less than $150 now ) - which lets you scan negatives/positives without even going cheap cd print . reviews what i read amazon , these scanners must amazing	1
item exactly described . works perfectly helped make some great shots yosemite	1
worked well while i took pictures fireworks over lake tahoe 4th july . only wish camera accessories canon logo weren't so expensive .	1
i purchased this canon remote switch 4 months ago i use it almost constantly . this one most useful camera accessories i purchased . every photographer should one his/her toolbox . remote switch essential if you photos low light or macro photography . slightest movement your camera when you press shutter release could cause your photo ruined . this switch eliminates " camera shake . " before i purchased this switch , i use self-timer feature my camera time delay very inconvenien t.t here few reviews saying canon remote switch over-priced cheaply made . i don't think true all ! i would definitely buy this accessory again .	1
anyone who wants make their photos different , this lens ! 180 degree capacity fabulous auto focus capability , this lens takes ordinary photo turns it into something extraoridinary . i shoot magazines many photos selected publication taken lens . it expensive toy , but worth money when you see results . i highly recommend it	1
i feel these filters not required if you digital camera coze you you what ever you like computer graphics programs only uv protector important	1
first , let me cover most important point : it work ? yes . praise most users express this item well merited . i purchased this because , like everyone else , normal batteries just not last . ten or fifteen photos , especially if you used flash , they'd ready change ; even so-called " heavy duty " or those marketed " digital camera " didn't make difference . well , both those terms should reserved these power cells ; they really less like battery more like power pack . my first charge up , which took only 3 hours 6 minutes - i timed it - i wanted actually test how many photos one could get . my smaller camera , 3mp fujifilm finepix s3100 , i got 52 photos , some flash , most without . not random snaps see how many it could record , but actually taking time frame them , select composition , etc . camera stayed entire time using full lcd rather than viewfinder , took all photos highest-resolution setting , transferred auto , manual , situational modes , charged full flash 8 times , went into preview mode . three hours , 47 minutes later , i got " low battery " warning - not depleted - low . i stopped then , sure i not overpaid . ** note : these power cells likely last much longer than 3h47m . lower resolution may result more photos . these numbers simply represent unscientific but strenuous personal test see what product would o.o ther notes product : - all parts except door made hard , impact resistant plastic . - fold away plug back makes charger easier store . - red green leds very bright , no mistake charge full mode . - two " channels " , . seems charge sets batteries best ; this may issue reviewer who reported issues using one battery time . - black ( body back ) , silver ( body front ) blue ( door ) looks nice . i one complaint , though perhaps it only one founded pure puzzlement . door flips open ... right . when holding unit your hand , monster logo top led bottom , door flips open right . my guess this decision made so door didn't close your hand when loading , because most people tilt it their left hand so it facing away them 45 degrees ; i know i . my final review : 5 out 5	1
2 years heavy use - not even one little bitty problem . they've traveled well under harsh conditions , they still function wonderfully . there you go	1
fits my canon sd550 perfectly no complains abt . quality product pretty good . when used belt clip , its easy open easy put camera back . camera seems very secured when used belt clip .	1
i cannon sd600 i've pleased my carrying case , it takes beating but protects my camera nicely . highly recommend both camera this case	1
i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
i using my sony cybershot dscn1 8.1 mp month now . it so easy use . , i love how you easily delete picture via touch screen . only issue i it , i can't use memory pro stick my sony photo printer ( 5 year old model ) , because stick not compatible . ps : don't forget buy memory stick pro if you purchase this camera . you're gonna need it .	1
d70s minor update original d70 introduced 2004 , few new features slightly larger lcd . it still great camera , but expect it replaced new d80 , which 40 percent more pixels , 2.5 -inch lcd , additional useful features old price d70s . so , you probably save little money still purchase sophisticated digital slr if you wait until prices d70s stabilize new , lower level . , say , $600 , this camera would incredible bargain . d70s shined one best cameras its class since its introduction . example , it 1/500th second flash synch speed ( found no other camera but d50 ) so you keep ambient light under control avoid ghost images . its autofocus fast accurate , features both single-autofocus , continuous-autofocus ( tracking action ) , novel " automatic " autofocus mode switches af-s af-c required . if you no nikon lenses , get this camera 18-70mm kit lens , which very sharp versatile , rather than more limited 18-55 lens . you won't regret it	1
just what i needed out spend fortune glass filter protect my expensive nikon lenses . i bought one each my different lenses because i would rather break filter than glass lens	1
i this camera several months now could not happier . i'll preface this posting saying i always meticulous research ( borderline a%$l retentive ) before making purchases over $400 . this camera no exception . i using " credit card " camera before often disappointed results . this camera corrected big way . pictures crisp video files very good ( although they hog lot memory ) . you must upgrade memory card provided . battery life me equal credit card camera i past . if you take lot videos battery life shorten . i carry extras my case . always amateur " photog " this camera excellent upgrade . weight feel camera perfect me . i friend who nikon . only real difference i see he change lens various situations , oh 500 bucks . overall this very good camera .	1
i bought this camera based several online reviews , including steve digicams , couldn't more pleased . i've using it since last christmas ( bought it present myself after six months looking various brands models ) . aside image quality ( which it plenty ) i insisted least lcd viewfinder ( evf ) well screen , real filter ring ( no adapters , please ! ) easy basic controls , long optical zoom , cf card , hot shoe ability use ordinary aa batteries pinch . also fit my hand feel natural . this all , plus actual cable release socket shutter button ! ( thus i easily use my cable bulb releases , well long-duration timer i my 35mm kit . ) it also standard pc socket more flash options than built flash or hot shoe . heft good , but not very heavy . you carry it long time without fatigue , but it enough mass steady your hand , enough size easy gripping . i find it very instinctive point shoot it . most basic control locations convenient easily remembered . ( zoom manual only , but suits me . i don't like waiting motorized zooms get where i want , especially zoom range this long . ) i'll leave it pro reviewers discuss image merits , but i say me they seem perfectly sharp very good color even default settings . addition , i've gotten very good results shooting night very long exposures . ( starry sky , clouds backlit moon , streets under moonlight streetlamps , etc . ) much less noise " grain " than i've experienced other cameras . so far it closest film i've found such situations - any price i afford , leas t.t he electronic viewfinder ( evf ) bright sharp performs well low light . i don't miss optical viewfinder much all . there diopter adjustment accomodate most people visiion . ( stops just short enough my worst eye - comes closer than most , though - but i find i use efv my glasses if i want ) . one accessory i strongly recommend soft rubber , wide angle , lens shade ( 58mm filter ring ) . they found cheap ( i paid $7 local store ) protect rim lens when you set down camera addition shading lens . there included hard-plastic lens shade clips outside lens rim , but t " notched " i worry catching it things - i like soft rubber ones better ( they look more " pro " too ) . it may interfere supplemental illumination lamp focussing , so you'll want remove it when shooting close mid-range photos dim light	1
( wife account holder)i knew before i bought this camera it just what i needed ! i am semi-pro-am photography hobby job . i knew i didn't need $5k camera we work , but wanted something more than my $200 point shoot . this it ! out box , it took 15 min take my first pic . hardest part threading camera strap lens cap holder - nice little detail . main selling point me " natural light " mode . tried flash without mode quality amazing . my little ps didn't any good low light without flash , this camera gets a+ . few minor notes i wanted make before i lovestruck : lcd screen no protection , just kind out there open . cover or even just little plastic stick-on most low end cameras come would enough make me feel like it isn't going bust . viewfinder really just mini-lcd screen , which i imagine bit number batteries , though not much full size lcd back . menu looks pretty extensive , but fairly easy navigate once it becomes little more familiar . so far , i love it , but took off one star because lcd issue . maybe i find cover or something it help me feel better it . other than , i already tell this camera everything i need take great pics get creative some manual settings exposure manipulation . love it takes xd cf cards - both camera same time ! save movies one , pics other ! it feels pretty solid , takes super inexpensive aa batteries - selling point me , hot shoe sync capabilities . if you looking go slr , but can't fork out dough , this perfect alternative . ( though check around price - [ ... ] rebate , i got mine less than [ ... ] !!	1
i paid $225 out door this camera it competes cameras almost twice price ! automatic setting , it takes incredible photos , but capability go manual if you so inclined . price , there nothing market comes close . macro this camera great close ups i taken even automatic setting unbelievable . if you looking something slr like , but not slr price , this comes close . course , slr take better photos if you expert , but if you amateur or intermediate photographer want something gets job , put this one your list ... taking price into consideration this thing doesnt disappoint . you glad you purchased this one !	1
wonderful camara , excellent characteristics , ample selection accessories available protected one you lead manufacture camaras lenses	1
i purchased this my s2 instead third-party adapter . only issue i it black instead silver ( doesn't match camera ) . i also make sure i purchased correct camera bag hold camera lens adapter attached	1
works great my s2is , clicked silver main page but switched black order form , didn't notice this but i like black anyway . looks good acc	1
what wonderful camera . photos come out sharp clear . small size makes it very handy carry around you all times . photos load very quickly computer . price i would rate this " best buy " . i found only one drawback which i feel minor . very bright sunlight it difficult see object screen unless it shaded hand or piece paper or cardboard . but this minor problem would not stop me purchasing second coolpix l4 . you purchase 512 or meg memory card very little money . check amazon kingston or sandisk . i both they great .	1
i simply love this camera , it very tiny size takes great pictures you buy rechargable batteries or regular batteries if you should choose . it simple use , didn't even read manuel . starter camera or advance user , get this one , you love it !!!	1
seems little much pay " extension cord " but upon receipt i see it very high quality nice build connectors . plus , its brand item canon , so what you	1
pros : - reduces flare ghosting when shooting bright light . - helps protect your lens dirt scratches . - somewhat protects lens case fall . better break hood than front element . - makes you look more like you know what you doing helps keep others carelessly walking front you . cons : - increase lens movement windy situations , kind like sail boat . - takes up more room your bag , even when reversed they still add diameter lens . - people take more notice you , help blow your cover if you trying keep low profile	1
i purchased this lense novelty inexpensive 1.8 lense . i use this low light sport situations like basketball or volleyball - especially gymnastics where flash not allowed . i'm not huge fan locked into focal length , but anything under 2.8 you don't choice . this definitely not primary lense indoor sport shooting , but it fun companion when you need speed 1.8 indoors	1
very happy lens , price definately right amateur like myself	1
first all , i am amature photographer , still learning curve . i avid film slr ( minolta xg1 ) user until i bought this camera . after extensive research , i finially purchased d50 . over one year later , over 15,000 shots , i couldn't happier . pictures just amazing . camera quick what you want it . if you point shooter , or someone who not like make adjustments optimal picture , this camera not you . i believe most people problems come lack experience , bad lens , or rare situations , bad camera . you must patience this camera get best out your pictures . pros :::: * sharp , sharp , sharp - always depends your lens - i shoot nikon 18-200 vr , even get wonderful pictures off sigma 70-300*instant start up*instant pictures - press button picture taken immediately*all manual control you could want*great autofocus metering , once you learn how use it - i shoot aperture priority autofocus*great pictures stright out camera - i rarely post-process*sd cards - i love small size quick write read speed . plus price keeps dropping*nice lcd - large , gives idea what photo looks like , but not trust it ( any lcd)*absolutely amazing battery life - i taken over 300 pictures ( without flash ) battery still reading full strengthcons :::: * not ideal indoor/very low light situations . bad noise high iso , poor built flash*no light top lcd screen*i don't really care " dummy " scene modes - this just may due fact i haven't used them extensively*it hard get used small viewfinder when compared film viewfinders . but i eventually get used it*may too small big handswith low light problems , i am looking into fuji f30 , since most my low light pictures friends i don't want carry around bulky dslr ! overall , i couldn't happier ! it may cheaper than most other dslr , but power lays lens photographer . it awesome camera i learned so much . hopefully i this gem while come	1
long time film person , i really wanted find digital slr could surpase feel quality film without guess . other digital cameras basically point shoot versions . two children athletics year round , d50 it all . we've shot over 3000 pictures past three months just soccer softball . nikon software makes converting storing breeze . only thing missing protector viewfinder , it standard d70 now d80 . there aftermarket available fine dept . i recommended d70 so many people nikon must put me their marketing team	1
make sure check compatibility charts verify your lenses work this before buying it since only handful series lenses compatible . if you already one or more these lenses though this nice addition . af only works lenses f/4 faster most camera bodies . you also give up little image quality putting this your lens camera body , but extra reach really nice	1
i've my canon a510 over year i still love it . i've taken it vacation me several times , including one trip yellowstone park , where i took 1000 pictures . it great . it small light i like way it fits my hand . it fast . i never spend time waiting it . it takes great pictures ! it uses 2 batteries batteries last longer than my last camera lasted using 4 . only problem i've occassionally lens cover stick not completely open . i just barely touch it my finger it unsticks opens rest way so that not major issue	1
i initially bought this switch able take fireworks pictures my 30d tripod . it worked well this application . got some great shots fireworks . since used it some wildlife photos it works well this application also . cord camera switch only two feet long . sufficient use tripod , but perhaps just little short any other application switch . i consider it " overpriced " what it , but if you need manually operated remote switch , it performs this function well . release button option where you lock-it " " . it useful if you what leave your camera shutter open long exposure . i didn't research any other brands remote switches my canon 30d . there may others , but i hurry something before 4th july , just ordered it , since i knew suppose work my camera . it performs it intended design function . it overpriced , my estimation , but if you need one , this one perform job .	1
rs-80n3 works advertized . cable could longer but other than i am totally pleased	1
i own this hood canon digital rebel xt . i like hood . it works well limiting stray light well protecting lens . you hear many experienced photographers ( i'm amateur ) , they would never shoot pictures without hood lens so why would you ? all hoods expensive what they , piece plastic , but they serve necessary function . get hood if you want best your lenses , including this lens 50mm 1.8 ii . i would give it 5 stars but it pricey	1
wow ... now if you really want see rip-off , here it . not damaging amazon.com but hey 50mm just get some carboard tape it front shield it sun . hood definitely not worth it	-1
this great ' only lens ' day . good weight vs capability handing most photo opportunities you'll come across . good price versatility function provides	1
i bought rebel xt w/ 18-55 lens exactly 18 hours before xti introduced , but that story . this my first dslr , i blown away results . but after initial euphoria , there always room improvement . my first choice 28-200 , favoring longer zoom over , but i found this one used penn camera got deal it 380ex flash , so decision made me . i like zoom range , it great framng portraits . if i need wider angle , i still kit lens . i won't make usual complaints herky-jerky zoom ring or rackety extension tubes , i prepared this these reviews before i ever saw lens . i'm no expert sharpness , still trying get myself dialed , but my shots so far look pretty sharp me . i no " " lenses compare , nor would i make comparison if i . my somewhat uninformed opinion , this great step up kit lens . this lens working guy afford most likely get great results . working guy , i'm extremely happy it so far , glad i made purchase .	1
it would cost you more buy these separately . battery alone could cost this much . rest accessories come handy . i originally wanted this only battery , but now , i options . great value . buy it	1
although this good batch accessories , camera case itself little unhandy times . it no carry strap -- camera strap sticks out through slit top . so , if you want carry case strap you decide take picture , you must open case , pull camera strap through slit , then lift camera out . it would not keep me buying this but it make it unhandy	1
i bought battery grip , based fact my rebel xt small camera , when using it my last model shoot , someone mentioned it looked like �tourist camera�which pretty depressing , since adding grip not only i more than enough battery life my camera , it also pro look people recognize , even though i still believe it not camera , it eye behind it counts , good looking camera always welcome	1
i've used battery grip almost every canon camera i've owned since 1980 . this rebal xt battery life seems almost forever battery grip , gets doubled . grip also allows you use regular batteries so you could use them should rechargables ever die you need keep shooting . it adds shutter release button turning camera 90 degrees . larger hands would probably find camera more comfortable more grip area . it adds more mass which pro ( little more stability ) or con ( heavier carry around ) . it would nice if canon could slightly remolded it stand camera up . it , camera lean forward it lense . bottom line : i'm glad i purchased but think it could much cheaper . when you consider ( way back when ) these types devices added motor winder ( standard modern film slrs not used digital cameras ) added battery capacity . all this adds additonal battery capacity . price reason 4 stars instead 5 . course most businesses don't care long people buying . mark	1
canon bg-e3 battery grip one awesome extra you cannot without . i found extra weight size not even minor burden . i rec'd product 2 days after initial receiving date/17th st photo fantastic job ( once again )	1
i compared number pro-sumer cameras became firmly convinced this best camera money . although nikon one time considered premier camera professional , they now take second stage canon not only engineering , but quality lens , innovative user-friendly design , overall quality . i used camera approximately one month delighted . talken pictures over 35 years - including professional - always using minolta equipment all those years , i am truly enamored this canon camera	1
this very easy use camera . simply using auto mode composing your pictures properly you get very good jpeg images . it also complicated you want make it . it many advanced features it . i shooting 35mm 32 years . my most recent before this one elan ii 7 years ago . it still working also . 30d my first digital i absolutely love camera . i generally work aperture priority mode tripod 100 iso when shooting landscape . but , camera very capable auto mode well without tripod . i like shoot raw so i tweek things bit , but jpeg images very acceptable . it also works extremely well portraits . it actually better than 35mm me because it very low noise even higher isos . 1600 looks like 800 film me . this very good value money my opinion	1
this lens works very well two amateur photographers like my wife i . we take photos our kids their sports activities . even though lens little heavy side feels like we shaking little when we snap picture , none our shots come out blurry . i am pleasantly surprised this . we feel it well worth price we paid . ( under $100	1

i am delighted this product . i am really grateful all reviewers this other similar products . image this unit fabulous ! i not any problems it whatsoever . one improvement i would like see stand helps unit prop itself up . it would benefit more secure attachment picture frame so when you pick up frame , stand comes it . this isn't any kind major issue so long you know how it works , you just pick up frame stand same time . i would highly recommend this product price .	1
camera works great , took it my vacation used it , videos cme out great !!!!!	1
this great digital camera . i no problems it . i got it my 1st anniversary 2 yrs ago . its great ! you take pictures , put xmas , valentines or birthday borders around them b4 you take picture . it video too , you play back video , but there no sound because there no speaker camera , there mic thuigh . so when you download video , it play sound too . camera survivied dropped many times . i would like take long videos , so i am going purchase 4gb sd card . i feel sorry all people i saw complaining camera because i no problems 2 years now . only thing batteries die quickly ( using flash really drains battery ) , so i went bought high quality rechargable batteries , or disposable duracell meant digital cameras . also people who complained blurry pictures , it depends what setting you camera . i not like all those different setings , they just mess up pic . not use auto feature i always use non auto , egulr pic , flash . all those other settings confusing . oh yes great self timer when you noone hold camera	1
great size shape taking places . feels good your hand . boots up pretty quick . like color . impressed features . takes decent pictures . internal memory , well taking memory card . i suggest getting set good rechargable batteries .	1
because its shirt-pocket size , this digital camcorder easy bring family outings such . i originally bought it because i plan attending my sister graduation didn't want bring plane both my very large semi-pro canon digital camcorder my digital still camera all its lenses . i took pure digital business trip plane just check it out it great fun . simple operate , results surprisingly sharp . only two drawbacks : 1 ) like any small device , could easy drop it , 2 ) it seemed like batteries getting kind low , boot-up time getting longer longer , after 40 or so minutes recording . i recorded 55 minutes , it still working . but , if you need quick capturing precious/important moments , might want carry spare set batterie	1
i actually bought this case house my canon elura 100 , it perfect fit . i really like belt loop although video camera your hip little bulky . my one complaint : some trim this case pink . now , i'm not most macho guy earth , but it seems me tht sony could gone little more neutral tone . end though it very minor complaint	1
forget packing any accessories--there no room spare . think this one more " holster " keep camera your fingertips without lug around full-sized camera bag . i own both , but big one stays home or car most time . integral wide belt loop allows me mount it my fanny pack waist belt hiking , i especially like gussets , which hold camera securely while opening or closing zippers . shoulder strap also provided if you prefer . although not listed , dcr-hc96 also fits , albeit snugly	1
this case very designed fit camcorder perfectly . but it would nice if there little more space keep things like remote spare cassette atleast . case god cushion all sides which keeps camcorder pretty safe	1
these glasses small , protable good concerts quick bird work . i keep set car , but they not replace my larger busnells birding . please don't expect more than little backyard birding these , i am now adjusted my larger set , so i use those yard . you get what you pay	1
bushnell powerview 12x25 fine , small pocket-sized binocular . since my wife avid bird watcher , we already several binoculars various sizes viewing power . our grandson accidentally broke her small 10x25 bushnell we used trips , so i researched , then bought this one amazon her birthday . she loves it . viewing power bit greater than other every bit compact , which makes it easy pack vacations , yet provides good viewing experience when enjoying various bird populations around country . we both highly recommend this , other bushnell products	1
i am very pleased performance rechargable battery pack . i not yet recharge it , i taken numerous pictures few videos . i would replace alkaline batteries least twice this time . these should pay themselves no time . why i wait so long ?!	1
just got camera what i've seen so far it wonderful piece equipment . my only complaint amazon misrepresented battery type saying it , " powered en-el3a or en-el3 " which not true disappointing anyone who upgrading camera use those batteries ( ie d70 ) d200 uses en-el3e which doesn't same fit en-el3a or en-el3 . aware this if you upgrading	1
nikon d200 amazing camera . this review amazon packing procedures . this review alert prospective buyers amazon not pack these cameras well . i just purchased one it came packed like book , very little padding . i called nikon their recommendation return item pronto . i returned camera ( much trepidation)and purchase trusted source . just wanted give you all heads up	1
nikon always leader photography/ camera/ lenses . others nobly tried but nikon remains high bar others only hope reach . when shift film digital began , there some speculation if nikon could keep up competition . well , rest assure not only they kept up , they continue lead way . latest example this d200 . like d70/ d80 - this solid piece equipment . just feel it tells you you holding excellent piece technology . but proof always end results again , combination nikon know-how nikon lenses lead even beginner come up excellent pictures . gone " lag shots " . you fire up shoot multiple pictures seconds so action shots all yours . without even " tweaking " picture computer program , you print top line photos home . people cited cons : expensive . yes . camera come hefty price tag but it should kept mind this piece machinery intended serious photographers . if you " vacation holiday " picture taker , then you should elect buy cheaper camera . same true difficulty multitude small buttons , dials switches . there too many they overwhelming but only someone who " point shoot " school picture taking . anyone else relish options nikon provided us d200 . room improvement ? well , battery life nowhere near good d70 which i upgraded but weak complaint you still get hundreds shots one charge . also , it would boon if flash would automatically pop up when needed like former models . so if you serious photography always one ready , this one you	1
i recently purchased this camera when my venerable nikormat el-w developed shutter timing issues during my photo 1 class . this camera reasonably priced preformed flawlessly thus far . i shot multiple rolls ilford hp5 plus film through this camera yet exposure not come out due camera . after reading manual i able easily understand different modes how change user controlled settings . camera flash leaves little desired it rather harsh its range somewhat limited , accessory flash overcome this there other flashes operate this camera not just canon . i not opportunity shooting color film through this camera yet when i i update this review . only thing i dislike this camera there no provision remote shutter release . rebel k2 date only version this camera use remote shutter release , why canon removed this feature this model unknown remote release very handy when photographing nature or when used timer self portraits . if you any plans infrared photography not buy eos canon , frame counter uses infrared sensor cause fogging your infrared film	1
soy un principiante en esto de la fotografia , esta ha sido mi primera camara slr , por lo tanto me ha tocado experimentar con ella para obtener las mejores tomas posibles la vez que han aumentado mis conocimientos en el area , el desempe�o es excelente tanto en tomas fijas como las que he realizado objetos en movimiento , tanto sus funciones automaticas como las profesionales ofrecen un desempe�o excelente , he tomado mas de 300 fotos en poco menos de cuatro meses , el zoom que tiene es rapido , los botones tienen una disposicion excelente para manejarla con una sola mano , lo unico que necesita es un flash de la serie speedlite , tuve oportunidad de conseguir uno prestado de un amigo el cambio fue estupendo ya que este tiene mas alcance para el lente que la camara trae , ya que el flash que trae carece de potencia el cual ofrece su mejor desempe�o en los 28mm del lente(no le podemos pedir mas un flash integrado ) , por ultimo les dijo que posee el mejor sistema de medicion de luz que existe en el mercado ( e-ttl)y esta disponible tanto con flash integrado como con el flash externo	1
we used this camera our honeymoon snorkling it great ! pictures little grainy , although i credit silt water more than camera quality since out water shots came out great too . lever front much easier use than push button strap perfect . we bought kodak hawaii when these used up picture quality significantly worse than fuji . we would definitely use these again	1
if you reluctant invest $$$ ' real ' underwater camera , this fine temporary solution . i realize it not rated go beyond 17 feet but i took two them 90 feet no problems whatsoever - all seals held i could wind film just fine . only slight critizism pictures come out more blue compared kodak max ( which i used same dive site year earlier ) . but hey , if you're going way beyond manufacturers specs , you're not really allowed complain ... snorkeling ( down 30 feet ) , pictures come out real nice	1
this cable works fine my sony dcr-dvd403 handycam . i play record s-video this cable . key change setting camera so it uses s-video instead default composite video connection . i found this my handycam user manual . it works exactly it should . perhaps this not case all sony handycams	1
previously i bought several ' no name 12mpixel ' camcorders whould produce great stills but left lot desired when taking movies . sanyo it all , excellently . excellent mic image stabilization this camera well worth price	1
filters included dramatically helped getting me one special shot i looking . i troubled glare such daylight looking way bring out colors . someone told me try filter i couldn't happier this brand . my pictures now come out right color balance great look out	1
i use uv filter my lense insurance policy . polarizer really makes difference highlighting sky/horizon shots . here southwest warming filter adds really nice touch lot my nature shots . very nice package overall price hit versus buying all three individually . fold up case also comes handy	1
i've this camera 4 months now i am very pleased it . pictures clear , focus quick options endless . this my 7th digital camera i purchased 2 close up lenses t-con 1.7 it which really made it versital . large manual zoom anti-shake best part camera . it very clear lens i like when focus manual it gives zoomed look what you shooting . fz-50 close dslr you get without all expensive lenses drag . manual settings let you set-up camera you personnel needs . i'm really enjoying this camera .	1
i'm not entirely new photography . i two canon pocket cameras ( 35mm ) sony digital pocket camera , so i some expectations what could . i say fz50 blown me away . automatic mode , it great point shoot . i doubt i'll ever use it video clips , but i've able include pictures my power point presentations very helpful . i slowly acquainting myself various modes capabilities , such macros closeups . this process take several months least . well worth price . quality outstanding everything works it should . i'm not sure extra memory ( 10.1 mp ) actually necessary , if you could get fz30 less , would actually better deal most folks .	1
this camera great , easy use clear results . we replaced cheap digital camera not near nice this one . we not professional photographers but wanted good quality , easy use camera family photos work needs well . we love it . its not one those extraordinary cameras all doodads but if you looking straight forward , clear pictures , its great	1
i am happy this camera . only it little bit outdated . but prce - performance ratio great	1
i don't think you'll find better camera around $100 , but it some downsides . most downsides it really really tiny lens . it says 36mm but that just 35mm equivalent ( not i expected 35mm lens it just i didn't expect lens small ) . picture quality still good especially medium distance shots high lighting , but low light hit or miss . it great camera vacation , or family photos most drawbacks won't even noticed these users . battery life camera really good i've taken 100 photos ( most flash ) battery bar hasn't even dropped . it also aut o-o ff feature save battery life when you forget turn it off yourself . this camera fairly easy use doesn't really alot features mess around ( or mess up ) so it great those fairly new technology . it also priced just right so you take it anywhere not worry too much it lost or broken	1
this my first digital cam . i looking good price , but also pretty good quality . i nothing but success this cam . it takes great pictures zooms subjects clarity i love auto timer 2 or 10 seconds . battery life isn't greatest but also not worst i seen . i would definately reccomend this others	1
just came back 10-day vacation disneyworld orlando , florida during holiday season . used this my sony dvd505 it fantastic . captured every single firework display without necessarily panning left righ vice versa . just propped my dvd recorder tripod it	1
good : wide-angle lens works great . i've mostly using my camera inside my subjects so close i need use this fit everything screen . not so good : i can't leave it - my camera bag too small . threads little small making it little difficult put quickly but certainly not hard	1
we not big users technology . this bundle very inexpensive allows us produce printed photos nearly no effort . camera straight-forward use , though not sleek some we've seen	1
i just got this camera recently printer . setting up very simple . only problem i came across putting ribbon printer . you use your finger remove slack ribbon but it not easy . when you put ribbon printer it gets caught something could damage ribbon . it takes time tons patients get ribbon printer . pictures come out very nice print even better . i washed couple pictures test quality they came out flawless . this camera value shouldn't passed up . screen camera huge buttons take some time get use too . if you any further questions feel free comment them i'll reply possible	1
i've s400 this housing two years now i've taken it least 20 dives . it gone me down 80 ft numerous times . no issues , no leaking . i am not exceptionally careful camera prep but i use dessicant - which i think no brainer uw photography . $170 this bargain lifetime . i love able use same camera both land underwater shots . i don't master two camera interfaces . after two years , even if it fails this point , i got my money worth 18 months ago , my opinion . i can't recommend this enough - anyone who nervous , just buy insurance your trip like other reviewers suggested - see how it goes . canon made fan life	1
works , which good thing ... it replaces single type card reader sandisk ( which still works after 8 years using it ) . windows explorer it displays removeable disk each type card reader it , all these extra " disk drives " confusing someone not fimilar computers or windows	1
features 30% more stamina than np-f960 rechargeable battery pack . i bought this after spending half day shooting sony fx1 very cold weather my np-f960 battery . pausing occasional power down , battery survived this bitter cold day lots juice left over . so imagine what this np-f970 you . i np-f960 clone battery , it isn't holding charge good storage . my only beef waiting it fully charge . if you serious videographer , or use sony hvl20dw2 20 watt video light , this definite " must "	1
great purchase ! case small fits 4 memory sticks . definitely recommend it	1
this little camera my first digital . it quality line samples convinced me . colors true life , not pastel look . this what i've looking . digital point shoot renders true colors . it very good clear view finder . unfortunately , it no diopter . but view finder this one very clear . lot you may not problem no diopter . i wrote canon expressing my concern view finders diopters still demand . lcd screen this washes out bright sunlight . movies this camera produces very good camera this type . i'm still learning how use scene modes , so not much share you there . i like " " mode changing iso settings " vivid " colors . ability change " ev " settings certain lighting situations big help , " auto " doesn't always achieve what you want . you ability change focus light metering . bottom line , you get lot bang your buck here . if you looking get started digital i , this certainly open lots fun interesting doors . experiment . take lots pictures . you fun while learning . i	1
after vigorous research investigation , i decided this camera because portability quality . bigger cameras may provide better hd picture quality but i believe you may lose lots opportunities since camera not your pocket . i used 4gb sd card take 1 hour hd video . two 2gb sd cards , i am pretty much covered most occasions . recent purchase 80gb portable hard drive i dump sd card , i don't worry running out storage . battery life also reasonable : i didn't measure actual hours but i used all three sd cards one charge . flash also relatively powerful , but like other digital camera built-in flash not effective once it passes 10 ft or further . ergonomical design best all like-kind portable video camera . i control button one hand without too much worry dropping camera . high definition quality not nearly good bulky ones such sony hdr-hc1 , but much better than average among same level pocket size cameras . little adjustment iso , you capture better images you want . however , iso 400 presents noticeable grain . 5 mp still camera image not good my canon digital camera but good enough print share friends family . overall , i finally settled down my seemingly endless research enjoy this camera	1
i purchased this polarizing filter my sony hc96 . sony store mall not it stock sony website also out stock . either it popular item or sony didn't produce large volume it . anyway , it took amazon least couple weeks ship it . i took filter my trip yosemite . it just advertised --- made sky more blue removed light reflections glass windows water surfaces . if you want keep reflections visual effect , you just rotate lens out effective meridian . protective lens came filter handy , too . first , i didn't know why i would need it because i justed wanted polarizing filter . it turns out it good protecting camera lens wind/dust water spray waterfalls when polarizing filter off camera . it seems pricy ($75 ) , maybe because it sony or because it not popular item . i'd say it not useful most occasions , esp . indoors . it luxury item outdoor shots hobby	1
lenmar msc-aa 1-hour mach 1 speedcharger seems all it promises . batteries charge quickly hold their charge well . my previous charger took approximately 24 hours charge 4 aa batteries , so this quite improvement .	1
charger works great . you charge each battery individually . my previous charger need battery charged pairs . built-in fan keeps unit nice cool , little noisy though . no problem here	1
this case great pictures kids underwater ! i also use it occasionally protective case trips areas where it rains lot- it protects camera very well . i wish i purchased it current sale price ! it little expensive when i got it ( half price camera itself ! ) but i no regrets .	1
this uv filter it job protect lens well . build solid ( metal construction ) . glass also descent quality . performance , it absorbs some uv light . uv light absorbtion hardly noticeable , probably sky 1-a haze filter version absorb more uv light than this lens which fine me . now , one problem which internal reflection . i've heard many people say it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out it not caused directly low light/night situation . internal reflection appear when there strong/bright source light comparison overall exposure ( surrounding environment ) . put it example ( which hopefully easier understand ) , when you take picture lamp during nightime light much brighter than surrounding area then you see internal reflection . you move position light closer sides/corner picture ( not center picture ) , internal reflection reduces finally dissapear ( if you move light far enough center ) . if light isn't too bright/contrast compare surrounding environment then there no internal reflection . but course most time , lamp nightime often very bright . but point i'm trying make internal reflection doesn't happen all time during low light or night time . additionally , internal reflection isn't only happening night . it also happen afternoon if you taking picture sun example . basically same rule above , how bright light source compared surrounding area , you move sun center photo near side internal reflection move side/dissapear ( also depending angle ) . but best way just remove filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you reduce occurence internal reflection identifying correctly when internal reflection occur then remove filter during those situation ( which not hard ) . i'm actually not fan lens filter ( any filter ) i think it only degrade picture quality we added layer sensor object , but i decided use them anyway all my lens . i would recommend everyone get one this filter if you don't any filter your lens yet . i use this filter my 70-300mm lens .	1
i wanted lense protection very low price . i can't see any difference my digital pictures betwen filtered unfiltered , using this filter . now , if i get dirt filter , or scratch , or whatever ... i just dump filter buy one	1
this really nice frame - looks like expensive black wooden frame . it extensive setup menu , but it really no-brainer . just pop card slideshow starts . cons : not remot	1

i using it almost year , i got it my mother , she loves it . pros : picture quality so good !!!! ( 7.1 mp)battery life superb , probably one best small cameras . lcd sizeno redeye ever !!! very few cameras this size thatlots featurescons : video not very impressive , quality goes down considerably when you make it full screen 15 inch monitor.it still very expensive , almost 300$ even now , i still think it expensive camera , but i guess it worth qualityi didnt use software comes this so i dont know if there cons or pros related .	1
i really like this camera ! it fairly simple use , takes great pictures packed features . it fits nicely hand compact enough slip coat pocket or purse . we bought this camera our daughter birthday . she using it ease especially loves movie sound option . my opinion , camera winner any adult or kid wanting good all around digital camera . my only negative it battery hog . most digital cameras , you want make sure you get rechargeable batteries large memory card	1
this camera takes great , crisp photos . it easy use , great value . even close-up photos turn out great . you would think this camera more than 3.2 megapixels ! you get much larger memory card though , case most digital cameras	1
this amazing camera , simply put . compact portable incredible detail satisfactory low light functionality - i love it . ergonomics easy get used battery life not all bad either . if you hunt around , you hear complaints low light quality , lack hdmi , lack mic input , etc ., etc ., but fact , i've found no issues this camera after shooting ample footage nothing but amazed watching output my hdtv . if you're not professional videographer , techno-snob , or av geek , but ratehr average family man like me who simply wants great up-to-date camera even your wife throw her purse use whenever wherever ease , this no brainer buy . two thumbs up	1
canon it again ! i got rid gl2 order reduce size camera got real gem ! now we more movies because camera so much smaller they all hd ! great little camera	1
anyone needing several hours shooting or picture taking away outlet source , extra storage capacity providied this pack almost vital . recharging taken 20-60 minutes which fits my schedule . i find this power pack greatly enables convenience long shooting periods	1

this my 4th underwater housing , second sports pack i used . it works great my hdr-hc3 , keeps it clean dry boating outdoor adventure . not heavy-duty like housings designed deep water , but fantastic snorkeling fishing trips . cons : hard see display screen unless you exact right angle control buttons somewhat small hard use smoothly .	1
overall it what it supposed . compact size plus . only complaint view gets dim when you zoom cloudy day .	1
fact this little light so bright both pro con . if you low light you don't want use night shot , this good light bring out colors whole room . it also small stylish while your camera . easy carry anywhere because it comes it own pouch . problem also same benefits . fact this light so bright , you get similar reaction people when they camera , " get thing out my face , i can't see ! " it so bright you can't get anyone look into camera . they're always squinting . but i figure that downside any light . if you feel light necessary your camera , this good light	1
i already owned sony z1u , paid $6000.00 several months ago , paid this canon lot less quality lot better , great low light , sony much noise same circunstances	1
this camera great . its low light performance high definition really great combination . side side tests i sony fx1 v1u it beats both low light performance lower noise . it many manual controls which key me picture manipulation settings cannot beat comparable cameras .	1
this my first camcorder ever i wanted it right . buying sony 505 great choice . large 3 inch touch screen really nice all controls extremely easy use . within minutes i recording my kids playing . i also love fact you record dvds well memory card . you really get what you pay when it comes this camcorder . well worth it !!	1

i bought this last year ago after my wife raved hers . it lived up canon name takes excellent pictures . i haven't taken time yet figure it all out but even movie option great . i love camera low price i paid .	1
i've my camera almost 2 years now . it great . i haven't any problems it , no lcd cracking or purple stuff . i dropped my camera before , i would say 4ft+ onto cement it barely left dent , it still works good new . picture quality awesome also video feature really good . i love it . but one con there no battery indicator thing , it only blinks low battery when it die , but pros this camera definitely weighs out one con . also , few reviews i read , some people said you'd take extremely good care this camera because it really sensitive . but honestly , i haven't taking care my camera . i don't carry it case i always either it back pocket my pants or my purse or i'll just hold it my hand actually it banged around couple times , but i hardly any scratches it except tiny dent one time i dropped it . pros : durablesmalllcd screen hugeit doesn't lagit cuteexcellent picture/video qualitylong battery lifecons : no battery indicatori definitely reccomend this camera everyone :)	1
i took delivery one these bags today because i've just purchased hdr-fx1 i'm walk around japan three weeks : oh joy it :-) i presumed bag container camcorder nothing much more but i wrong . firstly it very well made ( china course ) padding side walls ' roof ' exemplary : 3/4 inch thick . it good rubber feet quality zip . fabric excellent quality used similar before i attest its durability . camcorder fits perfectly inside no rattling there movable/removable velcroed partition hold lens hood separately if you prefer . supplied shoulder strap ok usable but i immediately ordered op-tech bag strap because i'm like ... strap attached hold bag horizontally or vertically you choose . attachments heavy duty steel rings bag usual clips strap . where bag really scores its additional storage . it large fold out pocket each end which hold quite bit smallish items ( my electric shaver vanished inside one ) . it also large front pocket running width bag which happily hold ( tested ) canon 10-22mm lens lowepro case canon 580ex speedlite its case room spare . you tell i'm mixing my slr kit my video kit but you could fit most video accessories bag . back bag zipped pocket ( flat ) containing rain hood . pull out hood wrap it around bag make it very water resistant . this covers whole bag except base ( i think , not tested it but look amazon image ) includes what top bag , it finest moment ... bag tripod holder !!! oh joy , i didn't know this when i ordered it it makes my life next few weeks so much easier ! top bag cunning set straps folds fabric lock small medium pod down securely . you still open bag extract camcorder even tripod place ( genius ) i remove pod few seconds . finally : sony either very lucky or very astute because tripod attached all pockets full bag exactly matches dimensions typical flight bag restrictions ( lufthansa spot ) . coincidence ? maybe but darned useful sure . conclusion : this worth every cent more . i happily trust security my $4000 camcorder it that all there said .	1
pretty comfortable . could more practical couple inner pockets	1
nice piece glass . easily screws over existing lens . job nicely allowing zoom through no unsightly bending around edges . attractive price too .	1
i love this camera . i would suggest this camera anyone looking . it takes great photos easy download	1
i several digital cameras this tops them all !!!! everything they say it , true . i love not even think batteries , i didn't believe what people said battery life , i just happy i didn't need think batteries , but i just got married my 13 year old daughter took more than 100 pictures this camera her pictures almost good photographer i hired yes camera battery lasted all day thru next 4 days our honeymoon 200 pictures taken , no low battery light !!!!! i even going buy my parents one . also , one more note i love how fast you take pictures , no wait 4 seconds shots . i kodak digital before only 1 1/2 years old hated it , i hated download procedure , it didn't put your pictures onto your hard drive , but it own little cubbyhole trying attach them your email absolutely nightmare , you'd identify picture copy it your desktop , remember what you called it then attach it your email . this main reason why i purchased this camera . i never own anything else , especially kodak .	1
my husband purchased this camera me my birthday last year . his aunt uncle one we thought it simply amazing . since our purchase , we've help several our friends family members buy same camera through amazon . actually , we've bought 4 other ones besides one my husband bought me my birthday . i highly recommend this camera everyone . it small , many neat features , quality pictures best i've ever seen any digital camera . don't just take my word it , buy one see yourself . it very affordable . ( best feature	1
i purchased camera after my old one ( casio ex z-40 ) broken since i loved my old one very much i concerned if new one would good old one . it 10.000 times better ! automatic mode helps unexperienced photographers take great pictures . but using individual modes settings results even better . i tested camera any situation during 6000 mile roadtrip across american west it not disappoint me all . only thing bit annoying everytime you switch camera it automatically go snapshot mode you switch through different modes again adjust settings you need . but surely there way figure out how avoid , i'm probably just not patient enough find out how since all other models casio cameras i tested not show this problem . overall , i highly recommend camera all types photographers !	1
1-25-07after my nikon 4300 stolen year ago , i bought nikon p4 april 2006 . bottom line : i get more photos acceptable p4 than 4300 but none great . 4300 occasionally produced superb shots perfect color incredible subtle detail . * my main interest photographing wildflowers . macro mode not focus close 4300 , there less detail what detail there not sharp , even " max sharp " option turned . color generally not natural finely graded even post processing . however , p4 not blow out highlights crudely 4300 . i take pictures yellow flowers fairly bright light still see some details all petals center . * p4 only shoots jpeg mode , no raw option . means 8 megapixel pictures smoothed internal algorithm into photo only quarter size original . three quarters information discarded so much 8 megapixel power lost . * mode i usually set white balance cloudy , sharpness max exposure +3 . this gives more pictures closer accurate . * photographing wildflowers i set timer 3 seconds so i brace my hands against my chest or rock avoid shake comes pushing shutter button . vr or off doesn't seem make much difference this situation . however , when wind blowing so flowers wave continuously , using vr normal makes difference getting adequate picture or blurry mess . 4300 could not take even adequate shots any kind breeze . * p4 seems optimized taking photos five ten feet away subject good but not super bright light . my photo water lilies taken top bank 10 feet away partly cloudy afternoon extraordinary -- sharp , perfect color detail . * 2.5 " screen excellent all but very bright sunlight . 3 " would even better . * lack better alternative , now i continue use my p4 but plan upgrade some point dslr , probably nikon d80 , which gets best reviews all sub-$ 1,000 models .	1
we took this camera trip austrailia , fiji , new zealand . vr great camera performed flawlessly . would buy again	1
i just received this device yesterday . i got play it hour so far . so , this review going " first impressions " or " initial quality " review . quality , packaging , instruction manuals , supplied accessories all look good quality . i couldn't find sd card packaging . i 2gb memory card me , so i ok . i could put battery , charge device , take couple pictures , couple videos without even reading quick reference manual . i would call intuitive enough user friendly . quality pictures video acceptable considering i used device straight out box without adjusting any settings . actually pictures video looked much better my home lcd monitor , but looked pathetic my work crt monitor . ( this not first time i experienced this . ) i played video 61 " widescreen hd tv using s-video cable quality acceptable . nothing compared off-the-air hd programming , but it not bad all . i placed couple pictures videos elsewhere web . amazon doesn't allow urls reviews . search google groups you may find link pictures videos . i come back here update review over next few weeks . update 4/12/2007 : i uploaded couple low light videos . link web site first comment this review . results disappointing . what i know now , i would probably give it only 4 stars . can't change rating now . i could quickly easily compile burn dvd using supplied ulead software . i didn't try any bells wistles , just used simplest path i production process 10 minutes . burning process itself ( 8x burner ) took long time ( unattended ) . dvd played fine regular panasonic dvd player . minidv based camcorders probably produce much better hd footage . but , not much use me , because burning dvd out minidv footage very hard . i don't think i could posted sample clips internet so quickly if i using minidv camcorder . so , should we compromise quality video or ease sharing footage ? update 4/16/2007 : this camcorder going back . while it very easy use very convenient quickly share footage ( compared minidv based camcorders ) , i don't think this replace my existing dcr-dvd201 due poor video quality under low light conditions . i am not kind maintain multiple camcorders use different one different situations	1
it perfect . i especailly like detachable side pouches carrying just camera . everything fits nicely it , cords all . this going really handy our trip hawaii april .	1
this bag perfect size . it carries my kodak easy share camera all its accessories ease . i love all compartments . they keep everything neat organized plenty room extra batteries , etc . construction bag also excellen t--t ough exterior shoulder strap option . highly recommend this bag !	1
this bag awesome , lots room everything . i looked all over bag large enough carry my printer dock all accessories , this bag even holds my camera accessories all user guides , etc ... etc .... you even store your camera too . i use smaller bag carrying my camera short trips but longer ones travel bag great !!!	1
there not much say this case . it more than adequate dvd or minidv camcorder lots room camera all extras .... charger , remote , tapes , etc . i would buy it again instant	1
sony quality every detail , it big enough all your handycam junk	1
if you looking entry level minidv camcorder , canon zr500 offers excellent value money . pros1 . very intuitive interface2 . high optical zoom3 . use joystick reduces number buttons just 3cons1 . motor noiseit also lacks still camera mode , though i don't consider drawback	1
i am very , very pleased this camcorder . it produces great photos videos . it small compact . price appropriate optical zoom numerous advanced options makes it one best options market . well , canon . thanks this great product	1
very good , small size , well made manufacture camera . reason i bought already waterproof camera-oly-720sw ., even if housing leaks it not compromise camera ., so it double insurance guaranteed longer lasting camera .	1
i never owned camera my life ( hubby always took all pics ) this perfect beginning photographer mom . it fits my pocket ( guess that elph part ) , we taken it two summer trips so far . i can't believe photos so crisp colorful , print up well ones we always developed drugstore . i admit my two young children helped me batteries , memory cards , understanding how get photos off printed . but if they it , i certainly learn . great camera i am capturing memories i might lost otherwise .	1
i'm amazed how my pictures turned out use this film . colors so vivid vibrant . images come out sharp . definitely film i'll using now	1
this camera best digital camera i ever owned . very active person , i needed camera would hold up anything . waterpoof , shockproof .... everything proof ! it compact size makes it great sticking your back pocket during night out town , or packed away your backpack while traveling world . large screen makes easy viewing your pictures all functions very easy use understand . this 7.1 megapixel camera taks great pictures aren't too large so they don't take up too much memory which makes it espescially easy upload your picutres onto social networking sites without reformat them . you definately get your moneys worth buying this great all around camera .	1
befores this camera i cybershot user ; since i believe this camera great characteristics : good flash level take close pictures , several especialized modes , compact size 10x zoom , great outdoors pictures ( vivids colorfuls ) . my main complain software : i not choose diferent flash intensity levels ( shots not well iluminated indoors really poor)and i not choose iso mode ( avoid bad pictures objects moving ) . besides night shots mode not good i expected . my general opinion this camera could really better if software would more versatile	1
this little gem camera packs mighty 10 times optical magnification into small but sturdy case . leica lens marvel design . it good easy read lcd screen very intuative menus . i now camera few weeks it lives up panasonics claims . i wish i could waited new models but i needed it my vacation . my wife refused entertain idea such large magnification range because lens size she envisaged , based past experience . she now completely won over	1
great little camera . i also dmc-fz30 , this one almost many features much smaller , less expensive camera . hard beat	1
i bought this camera my sister replace one i broke ( oops ) . it not zoom range her other camera , but megapixels higher . i borrowed it one day ( she let me ! ) see how it works . it worked great ! i high school gym taking pictures my son basketball game pictures not too dark came out pretty clear situation . i next step up camera 10x zoom 5mp not get clear pictures same gym ! i am very impressed she very happy	1
kodak camera dock makes digital pictures easy . push one button download all your pictures it charges battery same time	1
i wanted wider view camera this converter took care it beutifully . i'm very happy it	1
first off this fun accessory my a95 a80 . 26mm lens you shoot some very nice wide angle landscapes close-ups under $100 . lens sharp nice piece coated class . once mounted you zoom lens works inside adapter so you probably 26mm 40mm ( total guess)zoom lens . yes it barrel distortion , yes it stick out block flash , yes it black it look bit dorky camera . so either go buy digital rebel 19-35 zoom over $1000 or correct barrel distortion your image editing program , use slaved flash indoor shooting ( manual mode only ) paint it silver . bottom line ... if you like look wide angle , don't mind or even like very very mild barrel distortion ( ever so slight fisheye look ) , good silver paint , then price cheap hotel room or nice meal two , you lot fun this accessory . highly recommended !!	1
they what they supposed .. they batteries	1
this purfect , exactly what i looking , great price too .	1
this good product . i like way it automatically resizes pictures fit full screen . image quality excellent . it like always looking your photo album . one complaint - colored trim rings magnetic don't line up perfectly due magnetism .	1
nice compact it place everything i need my 35mm camera . shoulder strap adjustable makes it easy transport	1
overall i like case very much . it little big my canon powershot s45 , but extra room tolerable might handy later carrying other stuff . front pocket just right size my usb small card reader , extra cf card battery . i like dual protection camera ( velcro plastic latch ) fact lid entirely covers camera pocket ( protects against rain ) , it would nice hard case really bumpy rides . great product	1
easy use digital camera good features someone wanting venture into digital photography . canon not disappoint here . ergonomically well designed	1
this my first digital camera i am so impressed ! pictures very clear sharp . it easy use , even someone who electronically challenged like myself . my son(who camera buff ) recommended this camera me because canon reputation it definitely delivers . i looking something more megapixels , but he told me this camera would more than enough someone like me who takes pictures mostly family events he right . i would definitely recommend this camera anyone like me who looking easy use great quality camera	1
if it wasn't safety caps fall off easily i would rate this item 5 stars . however , binoculars great checking out sports like basketball football , especially if you can't afford pricy seats	1
i looking something stargazing . i read few reviews bought it . i couldnt see stars but binoculars if excellent quality , optics very clear without no color distortion . its reasonably light weight cost magnification . material very good doesnt feel cheap . if you looking binoculars take field trip , hiking , trekking , sightseeing etc this would pretty good	1
it good battery life but if only they make it smaller than it perfect	1
i'm casual photographer i don't permanent studio so i needed backdrop could set up taken down quickly . it also needed versatile durable . price , savage port-a-stand exactly what i looking . it breeze set up dismantle comes handy carrying case easy storage . although included paper bonus it generally too narrow my needs . so i'd recommend anyone purchasing this item consider how much width require consider buying wider seamless . outside i am very pleased this product	1
i am pleased all aspects camera . combining 6x optical zoom 10 megapixals allowed me lot flexibility crop my prints . stablizing must work , all my pictures sharp . there some lag time you push shutter button until camera takes picture	1
filter may cost bit more than some lesser filters but one gets what one pays . this filter kit complete plastic case pouch protect filter when not use . since it 67mm filter , toughtful touch because filter this large get scratched pretty quickly . what nd filter good ? think it sunglasses your camera . i use it allow slower shutter speeds when i want blur part or all my image . this comes handy when photographing waterfall when you want silky blur water rest picture sharp focus . it also works well car races where you might pan camera , staying fixed your target you shoot , creating effect blurring everything but moving car . very effective . those two main reasons me use nd filter . you won't use it often but when you , you create picture out ordinary .	1
this replaces my 2.1 mp digital elph i use when i don't want carry my big slr ( digital rebel xt series lens ) . positive : instant start-up , menu navigation zoomscreen quality comparable video ipodcomfortable intuitive button placementstrong flash ( camera size)modern/traditional camera aesthetics ( great looking)acceptable battery lifecamera operation obviously well thought outlow price what you getnegative : poor low-light shooting without flashlots noise iso more than 200no image stabilizationzoom ring spring little too strongplastic battery doorthis perfect pocket camera if you care more ease-of-use , aesthetics , size , price than trying capture print-worthy photo . overall i'm very pleased this camera , but only because i slr capture important moments/places . think great myspace photos rather than great family christmas cards .	1
pro photographer here . using so many different digital cameras .. because i am very picky . this camera fantastic . great looking sexy design . simple easy use . fantastic looking pictures .. fast easy small size fits your pockets . great micro function . great movie mode . sharp accurate color pictures .. best compact digital camera market . well always new things coming out surprise me but least now/so far this best one market right now- point shoot/compact camera catagory . canon makes great camera ..	1
i deal major brand cameras panasonic cameras my personal favorite ! i've seen people whine " noise " they make many times but never found it problem . i own fz10 fx01 my personal cameras . fx01 very fast camera takes great pics ! i love 28mm wide lens . compared most cameras i've used fx01 real good job metering light exposing images . i love panasonic solid build reliability . they may not popular canon or sony but my opinion every bit good .	1
good product but color not so attracticed	1
purchased birthday present my husband use his telescope . he used enjoyed this product several times	1
i bought this camera april 2006 it great ! however , july it just stopped taking picures ; camera would come one all functions worked , but you can't see anything lcd screen- it black . when you tried take picture it would flash , but picture itself black it still specs time stamp black picture . it like it taking picutres lens cap on- but it doesn't lens cap- which makes me think its somesort internal shutter problem . anyway i took it back store exchanged it same exact camera . guess what ?!!? new one only lasted one week !!! it same exact problem ~ ~ what chances this problem happens me twice ? now , unfortunately i lost my receipt , i mail my two week old camera off vivitar- where hopefully they fix it or perhaps i try out . don't waste your time or money there other cameras much much better ! only reason i decided this camera begin , large viewing screen , functions , video it easy work . oh .. btw .. if you use rechargeable camera batteries you save money regular double .. batteries don't last long	-1
zoom resolution amazing pictures generally turn out clear . " snapshot " function automatically adjusts settings seems little retarded , but " bestshot " settings numerous create good pictures . some great innovations i noticed this camera picture management software allows you view pictures your storage monthly calendar date taken . there other neat features , but i cannot think them right now ...... but remember i impressed . lolagain , zoom resolution absolutely amazing . because high resolution camera , even digital zoom creates clear crisp pictures many feet away . make sure you go through settings when you get camera disable " review " " record " buttons turning camera ( set it only allow power button turn camera ) ....... it way easy accidentally turn camera extend lens right into immovable surface . now serious drawback .......... absolutely horrible , disgusting , disgraceful , noisy high iso images . anything above iso 300 , pretty much , far archive quality	1
worth wile considering if you snap shooter growing enthusiast . great features mostly practical mini package , but prepared print out study manual beware some flimsiness [ battery cover , telescoping lens easily scratched exposed screen ] . don't overlook casio trade-in offer if you recent camera you like replace -- it could make purchase 850 true bargain !	1
my son plays competitive golf , so we golf course 4-6 hours . i follow take pictures mini movie clips my panasonic fz-20 . one battery last me least long sometimes longer i upload card my computer afterwards . this includes turning camera off during round . but i also forget turn camera off we walk down fairways , camera power save mode , it never problem . i always carry extra battery my back pocket , but rarely switch it out . i 3 batteries i rotate use . i just found panasonic superior product my needs	1
we bought 2 these battery packs our kids mp3 players . it saved us spending fortune batteries since they go through single battery two days . these batteries seem keeping charge least 70% disposable , since they four batteries they plenty back-ups . my only complaint when we ordered batteries we got one , but not second . i emailed company let them know please send second one . they not reply 5 days . they send second battery pack withouth further question . it just would nice get some response i least sent email right place	1
soon battery charged , we ready go . auto mode , it easy turn , point ( focus ) , shoot . especially love ( 1 ) speed which it turns ready go ( 2 ) large , clear display screen . additional modes available , but i only begun explore . downside , this model larger than other elph models barely fits into canon camera bag	1
i've purchased other bags but this one beats all it great price	1
well , i bought bino my 7 year old nephew introduce him birding . he loves it , infact he pronounced it " pretty cool " . good buy considering its compact what its supposed	1
this camera large screen very easy view . we satisfied all features this camera so far . wireless transfer function using our existing wireless network so convenient efficient . just need clean screen often because all your finger prints over glass screen when you hold camera	1
we bought this camera keep handy so it would always available around our newborn daughter . we bought case fits strap diaper bag/backpack/purse/briefcase this camera always ready when needed . size great !! we not intend buy professional level camera ( would bought d80 if i looking professional settings ) . this camera awesome !! response time quick , we not missed shot yet . when our digital video camera not readily avialable , it very easy shoot video s7c . battery life great . everyone who sees 3 " screen jealous it . picture quality outstanding . i've read several reviews mention problems blurry images delete pictures out focus ; i think these people must issues . i not seen one picture least bit blurry . i printed pics home my hp photo printer i photos printed costco , wal-mart , etc . quality always same ... awesome ! i researched months ( 9 exact ) before making my decision i don't think there better compact camera available . if you want slr features , buy slr . if you want best pictures small camera point-and-shoot features , buy s7c	1
this my first hdd camcorder . i owned several minidv camcorders past . i owned camera 2 weeks , so this review should considered initial impression . pros : - picture quality very good good daylight . i some shots night well lit family room , video not sharp day time shots , but still very good . - super nightshot feature fun take kids video while they sleeping . expected , video very grainy . - quality still pictures acceptable . - zoom very smooth- touch screen awsome . hope screen won't get scratched long run- camera easy use without read too much into manual- menu sort confusing some areas , but not too bad- lightweightcons : - pricy , compared minidv models similar quality- battery sticks out too much off back camera making it look sort ugly- allows only 3 still shots during video . i wish i snapshot still photos video like most panasonic models . - all connectivities charging base . this means one more thing carry vacation- no separate battery charger . battery charged charging base or camera- only 10x zoomoverall , pretty happy purchase , lot funs making family videos . i not make single dvd my previous minidv . this 4.5 stars rating	1
we wanted camera uses aa batteries ( convenience ) easy hold ( my young children when they take picture us ) so we bought this camera . i canon powershot a80 liked picture quality but it broke after three years use . a80 quite expensive time so i hesitate get point-and-shot priced higher-end . we very satisfied price , picture quality , functions a550 . only shortcoming a550 i noticed so far recharge flash quite slow ( even full battery ) so there longer-than-usual wait time before you take next picture after using flash .	1
i ordered nikon coolpix l6 ( 6mp digital camera 3x optical zoom ) then ran into friend party . he one i gave it try . slow fair pics . i went home , jumped online changed order canon powershot a550 . this camera slightly larger , but quick , good zoom , easy enough batteries takes wonderful pics . make usre you buy additional sd cards ' cause you'll love using this camera .	1
it takes little getting used but very similar any movie cameras out now ( focusing tilting ) . takes awesome pictures . i wanted camera small but least 10x optical those basball , recital , play pictures kids . i could never get close enough would get picture entire class stage . very happy now ! close ups items wonderful too . my daughter needed close up pictures flowers showed detail her science project i so impressed what we got ! my 10 year old take pictures without problem so shows you how easy it use . oh , yes , you see screen sunlight it very sharp image	1
i didn't want camera so small i would subject lose it ! i didn't want anything more than click shoot . i got just what i wanted solid camera clicks shoots without any fuss gives me clear great photo's!!i am totally happy ! should included started memory card case protect lcdmsladyja	1
i coolpix 2002 , liked it , but rather slow needed updated . new s10 great extremely cold temperatures(-60 degree windchill ! ) . it much faster than my previous digi . very happy it . haven't read up all features yet , but very easy use	1
works well . packaging item good package came destination good condition	1
this first camcorder i've ever owned . i saw it demonstrated shopping channel , eventually went shopping myself equal good price . it 2006 model , only around few months . after it just few days so far ... i'd say so far so good ! i'd say it fairly simple operate , offers great many bells whistles price . 32x optical zoom what sold me , it works like charm . digital zoom extends 64x 800x . i yet try out " super-zoom " . camera features stabilization control , but i'll admit its still tough keep it steady even 32x ! other features include night vision , live slow , automatic focusing control , auto white balance etc ... operate digital ( still ) camera well . if i make design changes , it would some operating controls , ff - stop - etc , outside unit , instead open lcd viewfinder operate many basics . only operational button within easy reach , release pause mode record standby . actually , button take " picture " right there too . battery power ok i guess . rechargeable pack ( included ) allows up 90 min average . upgrade 3 hr or 7 hr battery cost you !! no sd memory card included either . so end , if you compare features prices jvc competitors , i'd say they pretty well this one	1
this kit all you need start taking great photos online auctions websites . screen provides diffused lighting really captures all detail wihtout any glare . tripod not most stable , but it get you pinch .	1
i so excited when i got this camera amazon . why ? looks alone - flip out screen cool , like mini camcorder . it mpeg4 stereo sound which , indeed , very cool . , video great ! but where excitement ended . now i'm not technical but i've 3 digial cameras past so let me explain simple terms why this camera sucks . why this camera suck ? it bulky . they packed something better than standard 3x optical zoom i could understand but they didn't . pictures came out blurry darker settings . maybe i didn't make right settings adjustements ? but it worst standard settings all my cameras . flash weak . again camera this size you expect more . 5.1 megapixel camera only . not bad , but come one , my wife credit card sized dcs t10 7.2 , so again , why this camera so big if specs so ... average ... you need base station both charge camera view tv using av cables . considering base sticks out like sore thumb its bulky design its not something you easily take you unless you carrying luggage or something . bad choice . but here what really clinched it . after 3 cameras where lcd screen exposed i thought , wow , this screen protected inside so it never break - never mind none my screens ever broke before . so what happened ? two months after i got camera i dropped it waist level it fell little rock or something because i saw little indentation outside guess what - lcd screen all messed up . 90% unviewable . $450 wasted . i wasn't going put $200 get this junker fixed . bottom line ? best video i've seen , esp . size . everything else camera sucked	-1
when i sought purchase digital camera , i intrigued idea hybrid camera/camcorder . reading what written limitations these hybrids really dampened my enthusiasm . but i decided take leap sony cybershot dsc-m2 couldn't happier . it takes crisp , gorgeous shots automatic mode , although it doesn't many manual controls , it enough keep average snapshooter happy . movie mode surpassed my expectations . my little home films look like ones my dad made his expensive camcorder . it big , beautiful lcd screen which makes others envious . people complained design awkward , i joint problems , but handling it snap me . my only complaint i wish zoom function better ... otherwise , this excellent purchase	1
i purchased pentax k10d digital slr four weeks ago , am very happy this camera two lenses -- 18-55mm 50-200mm . shake reduction anti-dust features , you can`t go wrong . if you went canon or nikon , you would pay through nose their lenses . construction very solid seals help prevent dust water entering camera . features k10d make it joy use . i would highly recommend this camera anyone moving up digital slr . i am age 81 , so it`s never too late move up ladder . . . rhyn	1
i photography hobby over 20 years . i love pentax cameras because lightness lens compatibility this best slr i ever . i still need test some its features . but i am very happy quality pictures . i upgraded istds i got two years back . shake reduction come very useful when i take pictures my 2 year old son who not stay one place . i used get many blurred images ist ds low shutter speeds this camera handles very well . colors very natural i like fact i save images both raw jpeg same time . i usually use raw store my images jpeg web email . image processor may not good what u may find nikon or canon but raw images very impressive . i think i finally got right camera really replace my older film based pentax slr still i use all those expensive lenses i without spend more money . if u owner pentax slr many lenses wants go digital , there no better choice than k10d unless u lot money invest camera new lenses	1
i nikon lens pen cleaning system which i purchased fast easy way clean my lens however this system much more effective . cleaner phenomenal pre-moistened cloths come package easy use very effective . very compact 4in 2 1/2 cleaner tag my crumpler no problem . all dust particles i've my camera nikon lens pen cleaning system picked up completely nikon complete lens cleaner kit , i'm back crystal clear pictures again .	1
i simply love my nikon coolpix 4600 ! it so simple use offers so many features this perfect camera me ! i kodak digital camera but it big bulky , so i market smaller updated version digital camera . after doing some research i decided i wanted get nikon coolpix . it effective megapixels 4.0 , up 3x zoom over 16 scene modes . this such easy camera use . i basically point shoot check my results screen back . it red-eye fix which i love macro shooting choice well . one things i love this pulling out my memory card popping it into my computer . within seconds my pictures right front my my screen . i'm always impressed how great pictures come out . i love this camera ! i love size this camera well , it small compact , but not so small it hard hold onto ! nikon coolpix 4600 easy use takes great pictures , which makes this win/win me	1
fuji s5100 exactly one year now . meant write review after our hawaii trip last year . just back second annual trip remembered i hadn't entered review yet . first - you'll more satisfied more you use it . this my 5th digital camera first fuji . it really grown me . my wife rarely uses it since i take virtually every photo . but when she , i just set it auto , remind her how zoom , find pic just fine . i use 512mb xd . i routinely fill up card one set batteries ( almost all my shots 2mp setting which just fine most any purpose ) . but beware - use only high quality digital batteries . if you budget , here surprising find - buy kirkland 40-ct box costco . it only $11 they conveniently shrinkwrapped 4-ct bundles - great packing extra set . these far better than any other generic or store brand versions rival special batteries digital products . 512mb card , i never deplete batteries reviewing/deleting photos camera . download using card reader your purging pc instead . shots you might deleted using lcd may turn out interesting look when seen computer . , unless you really use lcd , learn use viewfinder it matches final shot pretty well it more discreet . here fail-safe insurance tip good shots . use fast shutter mode . there special button this top camera . this allows 3 shots time rapid succession . you select first 3 , last 3 or bracketing mode . i use last 3 almost every photo . just depress shutter camera starts shooting . when you release , last 3 shots saved . i always find least one keeper . ( bonus tip - only auto mode , you squeeze off up 40 row - try it knee level while following your toddler or during last 10 yards before finish line ) . i get incredible indoor shots without flash , using sports mode fast shutter while increasing iso 400 . sure resist urge zoom too far , shots get darker fuzzier dim light . use widest mode move yourself closer . great photos talent show without distracting performers flash . i recently discovered cool new technique using continuous af aperture mode . open up aperture highest level , set your iso 64 , find still subject interesting background . you'll get ultra crisp detailed view your subject background blurred slightly . very professional ! i use tiny 6 inch tripod night shots . there two timer modes . one 10 seconds one 2 seconds . use 2 second mode when you not shot . sure use bracket mode squeeze off 3 shots row . you'll get one regular , one brighter , one darker shot choose later . one technique i started using utilizing more candid shots less posing . you turn off beeper false-click sound using set up mode so your subjects less aware . while getting family line up group shot , try squeezing off few fast-shutter shots they moving around . you quietly zoom smaller group get some very interesting touching photos they'll never know . i think it relatively fast response time . it helps lot if you frame your shot before hand but it not really necessary . just squeeze half-way down so all you need squeeze all way right moment . when i can't frame exact shot , just pick spot approximately same distance frame substitute . this works well when there lots light . why won't i give this 5 stars ? it bit too big ultra portable briefcase or purse ( i travel lot ) i find some colors appear bland . i fix fair amount photo editor . but it still my favorite camera .	1
we very pleased product . we recently purchased brand ended up returning it mustek pf-a7005 . it easy use . we like idea able use regular flash drive .	1
i ordered this christmas gift my sister because i love one my husband got me mother day present . i love watching random pictures our family , friends , vacations often just stop what i'm doing become mesmerized . my sister her husband also enjoying it very much well	1
i bought this two reasons 1 ) i didn't large budget 2 ) i wanted camcorder palm-sized ultra-portable . i surpised how tiny it ( very ultra-portable ) controls simple easy learn -- perfect beginners like me ! i took it trip miami it worked great , though others found , it doesn't record very well low light situations , digital zoom grainy , but hey -- you get what you pay ! i first used aa batteries while waiting my ni-mh power up , they actualy lasted long time before i switched rechargables . i very happy my purchase , would given this 5 stars , it survived trip back maui ; i this my purse stashed under seat plane i may kicked my bag around bit . my pentax digital camera next it bag came through without problem , while aiptek doa . so , if you're rough your stuff , it would better idea spend bucks better , more durable camera . if you're gentle it don't big budget , this great little camera it little price	1
this camcorder pretty good . it perfectly priced , although amazon it higher price . good things : 1 . low price2 . camcorder/camera/voice recorder/mp3 player3 . very small4 . easy use5 . perfect kids who don't much money ! bad things : 1 . you need least medium-lit enviroment get good footage camcorder mode . 2 . only go up 512 mb memory card . 3 . ulead video editing software comes it doesn't let you many cool things , but picture editing one great . you should get this camera if you don't all much money spend !	1
i've amateur photographer almost 40 years devoted nikon user last 30 least . time i've owned every professional film slr original f5 , one time or , almost every piece glass 18 300 mm nikon ever produced . like many , i went through period only " best " my camera bag consequently paid premium own only " professional " primes zooms ( many which i still own ) . what constitutes good lens however not it performance test targets alone but how it performs real life . $1000 , pro level , 2.8 zoom useless if it so heavy you hate taking it you vacation . all money you spent " pro " performance useless sitting bag home . real life " user " , this lens hard beat . range covers focal lengths used large percentage pictures you want make , sacrifice 0.5 stops short end 1.5 long small price pay - unless you ( discouraged ) habit using slow ( iso 50 ) films handheld all time . lens covers it long focal length range surprising lack distortions - tribute designers - even usable " macro " feature . it equavalent my 105 2.8 af micro nikkor ? no ! but difference only shows corners wide open . occasional close up beach you might want grab vacation it performs surprisingly well . all lenses compromises this especially true zooms . this lens generally nice package stand alone vacation lens . or , if you prefer , couple it af20mm 2.8 nikkor old af70-210 f4 nikkor or newer af70-210 4.5 - 5.6 nikkor ( all using 62mm filters ) you very versatile travel package film shooters . my only complaint recent addition nikon d100 my collection bodies . 1.5 multiplication factor sensor makes this effectivly 42-157mm zoom body . consequently , digital shooter who " sees " wide this becomes unattractive range . if , other hand , you , like me , " see " better longer focal lengths , you now " normal " medium tele zoom macro capability . addition , since digital sensor only uses center lenses projected circle - this lens digital sharp my af180 2.8 nikkor prime film . my way shooting these acceptable compromises	1
if you looking extreame camcorder this one . i use it all my extrame adventures italy venice etc . i highly recomend this advanced users . his 5th camcorder i own . it produces great playback sound amazing	1
fit semi hard case perfect easily removed when using camera	1
i just got this camera christmas already taken tons pictures used video feature several times . its small design great feature , great students , styling absolutely adorable . my two complaints : 1 . lcd screen shows black what most would think well lit room . indicating need flash may more prominent than other cameras . 2 . camera not , any means , self explanatory . i absolute phobia manuals guides , so when i first got camera out box , i say only i amazed many functions fit into only 1 button . if you , like me , fear manuals , either not buy this camera or get trained professional ( or closest person near you ) help you figure camera out . one day time , my brothers sisters . one day time	1
when i bought my evolt e-500 it came genuine olympus battery , i bought knockoff use hot spare . admittedly they new performance degrade over time , but identical conditions genuine olympus lasts up 500 pictures knockoff barely 300 . i bought second olympus battery more confidence going out into field	1
i purchased two secondary brand batteries my olympus c5060 camera . price very good i thought i getting good deal . these batteries lasted one month then started indicate low battery after two shots . i purchased olympus blm-01 i am getting very good performance . beware sometimes deal looks too good true usually isn '	1
i bought these bird watching yard . focus them little stiff but i see well them any other binoculars i used . overall they seem good product money	1
this set binoculars performs it said it would , fantastic purchase price	1
this exactly what i looking for- small point scoot camera good zoom . it little tricky use but once you get used it it great .	1
ok someone go who doesn't extra usb port their laptop spare . forty dollars it bit expensive but what i say , it works	1
package real money saver-almost half cost what i could buy it office depot or even walmart . it arrived within 5 days right my doorstep ! also no shipping charges which real bonus those us living hawaii	1
i would given this 5 stars if info amazon/kodak website little clearer batteries . this camera dock not charge " rechargeable " batteries . you buy recharger . website says dock used recharging your camera but nowhere documentation came camera it say anything recharging dock . i think this mis-information , but we love camera anyway it takes great pictures . printer prints excellent prints also	1
this decent , pretty standard bino harness . if you're still using neck strap , benefits harness you don't sore neck end day , your binos don't bounce swing your chest you walk or other activities , it slightly stabilizes your grip while viewing . harness highly superior neck strap !!! down sides this model : quick-release clasps actually little tricky unclasp . maybe this good thing if you super-expensive binos , but i find it little frustrating . also , plastic strap-junction pieces aren't designed quite ergonomically they could . there big " nikon " logo back i wish wasn't there . but if you find it competitive price , go it . downside : bino harness makes you look like you're some tool thinking he tough because he wearing pseudo-gun-holster ( ie gareth keenan cell phone holster " office " ) .	1
i got hc7 couple weeks ago am really impressed image quality . i originally tried sony hdr-sr1 but put off its dismal low-light performance . hc7 much better front . color tends wash out bit , but noise not overly prounounced . however , bright outdoor lighting , picture quality absolutely stunning . regards photos taken hc7 , i haven't printed any out yet , but i've viewed some my 1080p they look very good . overall , i am happy camper . perhaps unfairly , i gave this 4 star only because it lacks 3 ccds .	1
i reflex nikon cameras previously this my first digital camera , im not disappointed . wonderful quality pics , very customizable , lot options course easy use . worth money . 5.1 megapixels enough quality photos superb . wi-fi bit more complicated non-advanced computer users , but works fine if you search through forums read how setup . construction camera solid , very confortable hand , but you must good pulse your hand or pics could distorted , otherwise excellent product .	1
i got this christmas , i notice price dropped lot since then ! good points : - nice small size ; easy pocket , lightweight - easy use controls . i like adjusting iso/flash/wb - automated red eye removal works nicely , auto enhance - new lower price ( wish we paid that)less good : - not sure pictures stellar without editing - shutter lag slower than i expected , particularly flash - wifi transfer difficult xp firewall . i've updated this review . owner manual under ports gives 2 settings windows firewall allow camera use wifi firewall . works great , but may not someone who doesn't understand these issues . documentation not describe this problem , you apparently understand issues . - must remove battery charge , flimsy plastic keeping it i'm afraid going break . - picture organizing software not great . i want able delete photos , only " some " directory views them . i'd also like easily lighten/darken change color tinting . i keep going back print shop poster making software ... i agonzing over this vs canon a610 . i didn't likethe canon larger size or 4 aa batteries required . i suspect pictures may better however ...	1
i lot review verious camerias prior purchasing this one . expecially comairison reviews number resourcs . this one floated top list though little more expensive than i wanted , used it , it worth every penny . features far numerous note here , but let just say camera beyond great . what ever complaints you your present digital camera ( if you one ) , this camer probably solves them . you read manul most super features , but it well worth it . borrow saying old tv add " buy it , you'll like it "	1
i've this camera two years . compared other cameras i've used , this digital camera very fast . only five megapixels , i've managed take some really fine pictures amazing detail . macro mode excellent . this camera also very durable - i've dropped it least twice hard floor but nothing broke . after using it obsessively two years though ( i literally attached this camera ) , camera lost some its reliability . example , when i'm automatic mode , camera would randomly switch review mode no reason . also , when i take pictures using self-timer , pictures now sometimes turn out blurry - it doesn't make sense me because nothing holding camera moving ( subject isn't moving either ) . also , this camera rather bulky heavy compared some compact digital cameras out market today . this camera little confusing use ( even manual ) when trying control settings manually . my photography professor told me canon cameras best manual picture taking . nonetheless , i really think i got excellent use out this camera time i've it - i'm quite satisfied	1
i appreciated they sent product quickly us . it right part worked correctly	1
grainy iso 100 pictures any light conditions . usage 5mp low sharpness options partially solves problem , but if you take pictures panasonic dmc-fz7 compare ... it clear garbage trash right place this camera . i panasonic dmc-fz7 only cons . really noisy high iso sensitivity mode . fz8 camera panasonic implemented venus iii processor ( fz7 venus ii processor ) . result picture quality really improved high iso sensitivity modes but dramatically changed worse iso 100 mode	-1
i just bought cannon 8x25 binoculars through amazon . because this purchase other heavy 35mm cameras i own , i though this shoulder harness might nice . after comparing similar products i bought this through amazon partner adorama due its low price , inclusion " metal split rings " " micro-fiber lens cleaning cloth " stated amazon product description section . problem neither rings or cloth came packed product . i could return it spend 50% what it cost me just so but that insane . since amazon provided description , i think they should credit me back something re-write description too . product seem well made money when i just tried it my camera binoculars it seem perform well . this god send avoid sore neck	1
i am completely satisfied overall value this camera . picture quality great it very easy use . lcd clean bright . video capture lacks little , but price i don't think you could get any better .	1
i got this camera my daughter christmas ... it great little camera !! small enough she throw it her purse go it takes great pictures . it many cool extra little features too ... like memo movie . only fault we've found it not come memory card . not big deal it internal memory , she just went out got new memory card hold extra pictures . i'd highly recommen	1
i impressed my friends my pocket photo album , referred few new customers while i it . not only it great technology which easy use , but it slips into your purse or pocket great way share pictures your dogs cats ; i make people look all five mine . you also share photos your kids , your latest trips , or even blackmail photos last party you attended . it also really cool design my " artsy " friends like colors fact it tiny	1
my son ( he 21 ) recently announced he wanted telescope christmas , so i got on-line educate myself . didn't take too long before my head began spinning ! so , make long story short , this scope i ended up buying . my husband immediately set it up blast it ! don't know if my son really get it now ! i definately recommend you buy accessory kit it also . i really enjoyed coming home work today looking all craters moon	1
i purchased this battery my panasonic fz7 except little high price i am very happy it	1
camera exceeded my expectations . some people stated customer reviews their camera case leaked ruined digital camera which made me hesitate purchase . i read other people reviews stating you must follow instructions ensure watertight seal which i made sure i followed . camera took some beautiful underwater pictures while i snorkeling hawaii . i would recommend it anyone wanting take some underwater pictures . my wife only complaint i took too many underwater pictures filled memory card . just make sure you follow directions you not run into any problems .	1
this camera great . i haven't used it much but times i its really nice , quality movies really good . i also liked i didn't need any tapes . would big hassle . main reason this camera purchased because i getting married it job quite well . i would recommend if you doing any outside filming need sound other people get microphone . i received one free amazon when i bought camera . it made sony camera . i would recommend this camera other people .	1
camcorder great . good picture quality , easy use , organizes your videos date , easy play back tv , remote makes it very convenient . battery life fairly good , but you may want spare if you'll recording more than couple hours time . i record highlights all day family outing still battery spare . software really falls short , i wish it half user friendly camcorder . it doesn't organize your videos well camcorder , dvd creation confusing rather limited . software documentation also limited , confusing , not always accurate	1
- stiff attractive leather case contours camera perfectly protects it against knocks scratches lcd screen . - includes belt loop . - when attached belt , camera slides into case like gun slides into holster . stiff leather strap wraps itself over top snaps place . therefore there small gap top- so you probably don't want this out rain	1
camera accessory kit perfect s230 because it didn't come camera case elph models so small , this kit provides kind protection this little camera needs . it comes smaller leather case camera itself then large purse-like carrier lots pockets zipper pouches . it thin case , not too bullky , soft interior pockets storage cords , user manuals , there lots room other stuff too . battery comes it useful because i battery came s2300 year or so it takes longer longer charge up .	1
binocs really nice sharp , but you purchase just good less . eye pieces difficult get used , but viewing i really like them . camera absolutely disappointing . i not taken first clear image . shutter top makes taking photo quite awkward someone small hands . i tried different cards , case write speed blurring image . no difference quality . i used prop snapped photo , image still unclear . played around settings still no good results . i would not recommend this camera all . help your decision , please view submitted photo . if your needs require better clarity than submitted photo , think again . this taken noon cloudy day . 3 megapixels . please identify bird inside airbrushed red circle . so , example : if you're searching ivory billed woodpecker , you'd better choose more wisely - cause there no way anyone cornell going accept this scientific proof . bird photo red bellied woodpecker , which approx . 9 " . i am 70 - 80 feet away . 66 ft minimum focal distance . hope this helps .	-1
my skill level : beginneri picked up latest canon zr800 local store tried some shooting it , since there no reviews latest model - but i totally disappointed quality - video granulation worst part - it motor noise which gets dubbed tape :( so i ordered this sony hc48 i am really really impressed performace , great video quality ( no granulation ) sound too . some you curious , it infrared light which great plus point shooting night time . infact , when i tried shooting dark nightshot plus turned i tried put my hand front infrared light , i could see patch light my hand , i really thrilled , seeing its actually light coming out camera . ofcourse you probably need use tripod shoot night light better stability . also , it various other features/modes i didnt notice canon . instance , it color mode bring out colors more effectively low light , shooting mode capture minute objects like insects etc .. i am glad i returned canon zr800 bought this	1
we got this printer dock bundle easy share camera ( c643)earlier this year . this our first experience printer dock we've happy it . it super easy print high-quality pictures right here home . we've since added easy share camera ( z612 ) our household used dock print both cameras . it easy switch one camera other - just remove plastic " foot " camera snap other one dock . we've not used wifi option , nor printer dock connected our computer , so i can't comment those particular options . we've noticed one little glitch dock - every once awhile , it seems not recognize camera . example , if camera off dock it put back , dock doesn't " power " camera . we've fixed this unplugging dock few seconds , then plugging it back . when it plugged back , it'll go through its start-up works fine . this certainly not everyday occurance - i'd venture it happens maybe once month or less . even though it bit annoying , it doesn't really decrease our overall opinion printer dock	1
more than satify this product , easy use excellent results . photoes sharp excellent colour reproduction , highly recomended any one who owns kodak camera or any other camera , must . thanks kodak	1
echoing what most others said , this great camera . it dream use , pictures stunning . since it based minolta design , it accepts lenses my old minolta maxxum 9000 ( circa mid 1980s ) . this huge benefit me ; i now excellent quality 70-210mm zoom lens my new alpha-100 no additional cost ! auto-focus ttl metering work properly , since anti-shake hardware camera body , works old lens also . even my old minolta cable release ( switch end electrical cable proprietary rectangular plug ) connects works fine . i'm very happy camera . said , there couple annoyances . one them might significant you , depending how you want use camera . first , noise . not picture noise , grainy low-light photos , but acoustic noise . shutter mechanism * loud * , much louder than my old maxxum 9000 . if you want unnoticed photographer taking discreet pictures like cartier-bresson his leica , this isn't your camera . second , lens shade . this nit , but i find it more clumsy use than lens shade old camera . old one held spring clasp ; you just squeeze opposite sides install or remove it , or reverse it storage . new one positioned precisely so tabs lock into place when it turned . not quick or easy use , but not really big deal . i suppose it saved couple dollars , new one one piece plastic while old one several parts . whole , excellent product . i'd buy it again heartbeat	1
i checked lot camera reviews many sources it hard find anything better than dvc-30 making documentaries , shorts , sketches , interviews . i tape lot live performances well , after i figured out how simple it adjust colors settings , it puts out great picture . i friend consumer sony hd , he wants get this camera . only drawback : xlr adapter around $200 bucks , but if you need super high quality sound , it worth it . i shot short horror film right out box , it came out amazing true black white infared . i love this camera	1
this superior camera money . simple operation well constructed . it " well built feel " it fits well your hand . detail image awesome , better than i hoped . i'm very impressed 16x zoom , very nice clean image . don't fooled size this camera , quality image beautiful . lot camera little package . it 4 built shooting settings different situations . it low level light option decent job capturing scene after dark . i gave it 4 stars because i didn't like manual it came manual controlling iris focus could made easier access use . built microphone not really pick up desired audio well . i recommend picking up external boom microphone or lapel mic system supercede built mic depending your application . if you need firewire cable download video your computer make sure you pick one those up well . camera firewire port 4pin firewire connector	1
i picked this camera up amazing 150 dollars sam club ! i originally going buy canon powershot a630 but didn't want pay 100 dollars more . this camera takes awesome pictures great movie mode . i don't know much photography jargon , but i know you adjust white balance , iso shutter speed manual mode . some shots come out blurry but most look great i'm sure look better 3x5 photo . i blown away macro mode , i submitted macro my eye . photo viewer here amazon doesn't picture justice ... when i view it my computer it just breathtaking how detailed it . my old cam 2.3 megapixel i could only take 16 pics internal memory , fuji f10 my 1gb olympus xd card , i take 341 fine-quality 6mp pics . i love this camera	1
i recently purchased f10 my local walmart clearance . i would recommend f10 anyone seeking easy point shoot camera good battery life . i tried f10 after purchasing 2 other digital camera . f10 comes 16mb xd memory card approprate cables . battery built but exceptional life . i initally concerned only one battery , but performance demonstrated there no need concern . terms picture performance camera number settings but takes excellent photos use auto focus setting . it also works well motion once you understand how use autofocus . pictures this camera much better than 8mp polaroid i using . i purchased 512 xd card this seems meet my needs terms storage capacity . overall this best camera i seen $200 . it rated 1 consumer reports last year . if you find one under $200 its well worth your money .	1
after much research i finally found binoculars fit my every need . price right , delivery right schedule , product excellent	1
this camera great ! not only it take great digital photos extremely user friendly , but if you add 1gb memory card it ( which slides right only costs $40.00 ) you take lot great quality digital videos sound very easy upload your computer and/or internet email family etc . fact , there no need buy video camera when you this it fits right your pocket . i take up 30 minute videos lots photos one time . you easily take photo while you making video well	1
i used camera three months , absolutely love it ! pictures crisp ( even very close-ups ) , video feature right up there . sound pick-up excellent . i created two dvd combining videos still pictures . folks thought quality very good . battery life rated very good , i found this true . i carry camera me nearly everywhere i go . people impressed size . drawbacks ? because its size , there no connections camera computer , tv or battery charger . docking station small lightweight . because battery life , i never away home long enough need recharging . i recommend camera without reservations , look first casio future	1
this really great camera ( it purpose ! ) this isn't camera get if you want super-fine shots or some kind amateur photographer . if you want camera preserve memories , snap shots during travel , parties , etc , this one get . here few my favorite things camera : solid construction . thing just reeks quality . very fast startup time - not only it easy fit pocket so you grab it while other idiots unzipping their camera bags , but it starts up so fast you're taking picture before you know it . portability - i've taken this everywhere . i've gotten great pictures i'd never gotten otherwise because this camera small , unobtrusive , always available , etc . i'm very happy this purchase my next digital camera ( sooner or later people laugh 5 megapixels ) definitely card/small sized casio	1
this post-christmas gift myself . i shopped around read many , many reviews . this my choice because it seemed offer best value my price range its 5 megapixels optical zoom . i bit surpised find it didn't come even small , cheap case keep it . so if you buy one , you'll need make sure you or get case it . i've just recently finally worn out batteries . it would nice guage screen tell me how low my power before it shut off . operation easy pictures come out nice clear . however , i found it usually works best without flash so i turn off . but if you use flash get red-eye , you remove picture right there camera which pretty neat . only things would made this better would battery guage , quicker shutter time case . but i'm giving it five stars because i feel i got more than my money worth here	1
it came before expected , nice , so nice , all new , working fine . ' i truly recommend beach camer	1
i sticked sony since i got my first digital camera 4 years ago sony camera moneys worth ! this one dsc-t10 one parent who carrying much already needs pack down change . it fits my purse still space more , only thing remember buy slim fitting case camera extra battery(for those kind battery not sold everywhere ) you need one when you don't thing you need extra battery , you always run out wrong time . i recommend this one	1
what purchase !! simple easy setup great christmas gift . now it holds our wedding photos proudly displayed living roo	1
late 1960 early 70 , i purchased nice 35mm slr lot accessories while navy . once i got back state re-entered college , i could not afford take develop all pictures anymore , so i sold all my equipment . recently i wanted get back into photography intrigued point shoot digital market . cost developing prints limited me my desire take lots pictures given subject . plus , i want more than just snap photos family ge t-t ogethers . digital cameras solve these problems finally grown up their ' toy-like ' beginnings . consumer reports rated this camera " best buy " advanced compact . all i say this camera " wow ! " addition " auto " point shoot , fujifilm finepix e900 modes natural light , portraits , sports , after dark , plus ' photo ' mode lets you change focusing method , photometric method , white balance , flash intensity . it also functions allow up 40 shots burst mode auto-bracketing shots changing exposure value ( ev ) your shots . you also work shutter speed , apperture setting or just everything manually . it also movies up 30 minutes long 1 gbyte xd photo card . what makes this advanced point shoot great . i experiment subject take hundred shots just see how camera responds then keep all , some , or none pictures i not spent cent photo-finishing . 3 weeks , i taken over 1,100 shots while trying learn basics operation . it very easy camera use . it forgiving auto mode most other modes also . if you want camera more than point shoot , then e900 good camera consider . sucking pictures off camera into ' my pictures ' folder your pc simple plugging camera into usb port clicking ok . software included camera basic editing . word warning , however , buy large xd memory card when you buy camera . camera shipps 16 mb xd-picture card holds three 9-megapixal pictures ! 1.0 gb xd holds 200 shots , while 2.0 gbyte xd hold 400 shots . you , course , crank quality down little 2-megapixals . also buy rechargable ' aa ' batteries . e900 accept regular ' aa ' batteries , but life two standard alkaline batteries 20 shots compared 160 rechargable ones . i am still learning bells whistles , but thus far , i like what camera how it it	1
i'd assumed e900 would slight improvement over e600 , very least pulling even . i surprised how much improved e900 over e600 , camera i've very satisfied . performance : point shoot capability much improved , especially low light conditions ; less sensitive shake , remarkable improvement movie mode sharpness low light . convenience : tether outlet cover ; no longer go through menu multiple shot preview , display " sticky " . nit-picks : i/o ports reordered , causing initial confusion a/v power ports , a/v power ports use same connector , case marginally cheaper maybe less robust than e600	1
this camera deserves 5 stars if you need camera easily fits your pocket or purse ready use whenever picture or movie moment arrives , even under water . considering varied picture taking situations , action , lighting conditions , performance beyond my expectations . only significant limitation seeing display bright sunlight or under water , even when screen set its brightest . however , aiming intuitive enough i never missed shot i able change modes even under water ( but i practice switching underwater wide 2 movie ahead time ) . one feature would improvement would ability zoom while taking movie . i received this camera just couple days before leaving cruise so i didn't any time practice it . careful not your finger front lens , especially under water where you may not watching screen . also aware when you zoom movies image movement also magnified . wide angle underwater movies much better than full optical zoom ( digital zoom off ) . after couple days controls easy use change modes review pictures movies . i used 1 gig cards highest resolution which provided 240 pictures or 40 minutes movies . switching back forth easy . movie recording continue until card full or battery runs out , not just short clips . my clips too short until i comfortable i would not quickly fill up memory card or run out battery . under water pictures superb natural shift color toward green . i recharged battery every other night . battery able take 100 pictures 15 minutes movie recharges . i recommend spare battery it indicate it getting low couple times ran out once . camera also used daylight , inside , without flash , even night shots ( auto setting better than night scene harbor lights night . camera steadied railing ) . i purchased lanyard metal clasp sports authority dollar which provides very secure leash . lanyard around my neck i could tuck camera my shirt pocket . i always ready next picture opportunity without worrying dropping it . i'm very pleased picture quality although it may not match camera much larger lens system , but it great able take pictures movies when i would not my larger camera available . 15 fps movies not match 3ccd digital video camera , but they acceptable . i even recorded short clips during live theater performances ( screen brightness set its minimum ) i pleased quality this tiny camera .	1
i use this case carrying ps digital camera accessories . case well-designed crafted . padding provides ample protection contents . movable divider padded makes case versatile . lowepro products deliver excellent value money . highly recommended	1
real high quality bag very low price . well padded perfect today small camcorders . enough room necessary accessories(eg . batteries , mini dv tapes , cables , mmc/sd card ) . good enough fit my elura 100 my canon sd700 fitted inside canon psc-55 deluxe leather cas	1
unlike one other wireless mic , i used , this one never yet picked up fluorescent light noise . battery economy this mic . quite good . transmitter receiver each use one size aa penlight cell , which seems last least 10 hours . i suspect this microphone sometimes picks up cell phone interference cell phones room , since i don't know what else would cause rare rat-a-ta t-t noise receiver picks up . best advantage this microphone there seldom any dead spots room where receiver gets weak signal	1
$15.95 kodak site . strange ! cable usb kodak 4 pin usb not firewire some folk tried say . typical cost video/audio $4 , kodak usb kodak/usb/b4 $9 ( oem ) $14 ( radio shack ) $19 ( kodak ) respectively so should considered even if you just want new cable . oh dock connector changer works great ! use it work my report shots . doesn't care if you use kodak easyshare software or xp pro camera wizard . just works	1
i this more than month now . installed 256 mb sd card , currently loaded 800 photos , configured my albums based trips occasions . i set photo frame slide show mode daily auto off settings . 1 week ago , i bought product , pandigital ( 7 ) w/ 128 mb built memory . philips far better picture display where pandigital acceptable photo display . when you look closely or stare photos , you immediately see philips not any grainy reproduction . it also elegant slide show transitions ; pandigital needs work their transitions . you just patient when transferring files your pc photo frame , i find myself hitting reset button more than i really would prefer . i find this no harm my pictures . this resolved just your pictures displayed straight or transferred your card . i just chose pc method because easier management what i needed transferred .	1
this good product . i like way it automatically resizes pictures fit full screen . image quality excellent . it like always looking your photo album . one complaint - colored trim rings magnetic don't line up perfectly due magnetism .	1
we ordered this product retirment present co-worker who leaving week so we even fed ex shipping . product kept showing up order status never updated until almost week later when it delivered . product arrived excellent condition but we wondering if it ever shipped ... amazon or retailer needs update shipping info instead leaving product showing order status not shipped	1
i leaving college this fall wanted little something easy handle send home videos , or post them . it works great ! i am especially excited compiling them onto dvd my laptop dvd burner . it so tiny it fits my pocket it very good batteries , you need buy scan disk ( i suggest 512 mb or 1 gig ) but it still turns out cheaper than regular clunky sized video camera . course it isn't amazing quality but it small enough take anywhere capture every anything . great deal money	1
good product , like price . this much less expensive than current pinseeker 1500 models , i bought it ebay used $150 so you may able find it less ( look under hunting golf rangefinders this model ) . this not pinseeker feature newer models but normal mode scan mode work perfectly ranging flags no reflectors ( although you may need try more than one time relatively stable hands ) . i able range flag 270 yards , able range top telephone pole 375 yards ( but it windy so flag straight out little cloudy ) . i would estimate this work ranging flags calm sunny day ( these don't work well sunny day because laser used visible light laser gets little interference sunlight ) 215-230 yards flag ( which what i need it ) . less expensive alternative than pinseeker , i really like performance , very impressed .	1
i am female bowhunter who really trouble judjing distances green fields . this great product . it easy use very accurate	1
i am extremely pleased this flash . olympus well ahead curve digital camera , lens flash integration . fl-36 achieve beautiful photographs appear taken natural light . i am just beginning discover its capabilities . you spend some time manual fully utilize its features . before purchasing , i read complaints fact it utilzes only two aa battries short battery life . i haven't found this much problem , using 2400 mah ni-mh batteries . they're cheap , easy carry recharged quickly fast-charger . it not cheap or disappointing . i highly recommend	1
my evolt 500 , i found automatic flash came camera would often give blue hue photos when flash came into use . finally photos bright no longer blueish hue . one thing isn't mentioned other reviews no battery comes this camera . make sure you order battery so you use this flash right away .	1
this set binoculars performs it said it would , fantastic purchase price	1
i bought few binoculars past couple years . satisfied only couple . these binoculars i am very pleased . clarity very good price terrific . i wasted alot money some not so good bushnell binoculars . but this pair pleasant surprise	1
so far i've this camera week im am pleased everything . its actually my 10th digital camera i think i've finally found one i like . it takes beautiful pictures , film good movies it also great sound . its also smaller than any other camera i've bought better looking . i think it takes pictures better night though sometimes good thing . buy it cause its very nice !!	1

controls this camera not hard figure out . it fun haveall little things you pictures 12 almost 13 , photogerphy somthing i love this camera . if you think thiscamera complicated , well you didnt read instruction guide very well	1
i great dslr i use " real " photography , but there times you just want throw camera your pocket go . samsung digimax great . 5 mp it great family ge t-t ogethers , business travel , kids playing , pets pets , etc . i'm not thrilled it didn't come case . it would nice just little pouch - even if it adds couple bucks price . perhaps i'm spoiled my " good " camera , zoom leaves little desired clarity department . transferring your computer super easy . i didn't even install software came it any my machines . i bought one my mother law well , so i recommend this camera non-tech savvy person . she able use it no issue . i'd also recommend it second camera	1
it ac adapter . one end plugs into wall , other end plugs into camera . it pretty hard screw up	1
camera works great , especially under water case it . i love item , it fits very nicely pocket going out camera get pictures too	1
-this camara picture quality nice , depend user purpose . my gf kinda satify it . -function easy use . -battery life so so . -battery charger design not convenience . you put battery into batter charger . recommand get cradle charger , but extra cost . it should sell cradle charger .	1
i bought this item whim before trip europe case we wanted take some pictures us trip . it turned out one best ideas i trip . it small , so it easily carried around bag or even your pocket light so you don't even notice it . when it proved immensely valuable taking picture low light situations . i tendency shake bit , so i get blurry pictures quite often . long exposure times low light situations compound problem even further . many old churches few museums they allow pictures , but no flash ( flash ruins art ) . i able get some great pictures because i able set up tiny tripod allow camera sit perfectly still 2 4 seconds exposure finish . it also took some great pictures night dimly lit monuments again ability aim hold perfectly still those couple seconds key great pictures .	1
great addition my sony v1 . very sturdy . well built . looks great . it comes carrying case soft towel wipe it down . overall good	1
it possible love inanimate object ? because i am !!! i love wide angle lens this camera , it just makes pictures look more professional whether your doing landscapes portraits or just night out bar . i'm not big fan their red eye technology , but rest makes up it . you use fish eye lens , sepia aged look , or spotlight . it also enhances your pictures perfect touch , if you so choose , your pictures become more vibrant ( helpful if they taken dark setting . plus you 26 different portrait settings choose ( landscape , action , night , portrait .... ) it great buy me . it very sleek easily fits pocket	1
there lot canon lovers who like post negative reviews other camera brands . well , this camera unique feature other brands don't -- in-camera stitching up three wide angle shots so you get great superwide panoramic shot right out camera . no computer needed . yes , you save shots individually if you want stitch them computer . just save three individual 23 mm shots -- it not rocket science . comments camera lacks raw silly -- this not big , bulky dslr or really sophisticated camera lots manual controls -- sorry , but not target this camera -- it pocket camera takes easy , wide angle shots panoramics . raw people who want fine tune pictures their computers . so , sum , this great camera shooting scenery when indoors , getting all folks picture without back up far away . i highly recommend it ! ( kodak colors wonderful !	1
i bought this case my new kodak digital z700 camera . it perfect fit . prior purchasing case , i read several reviews . many slightly negative , saying camera didn't fit properly case . few people said they're glad they didn't listen other reviews because case perfect fit them . i'm latter category . this case perfect size me ... way z700 fits it , ease carrying it around	1
i used this lens year both film digital . general , it decent lens price . even though it ed ( extralow dispersion ) , i get purple fringing high-contrast subjects long ( telephoto ) zoom . since i wild bird photography , this would show up purplish bird beaks twigs against bright sky . annoying . other hand , it produced some excellent portraits even wildlife photos where contrast wasn't excessive . doing side-by-side test w/ help camera store d70 , i compared this lens both 80-400/ 5.6 vr ( nikon ) tamron 200-500/ 6.3 . all three " good " , but nikon vr sharpest ( tamron roughly similar ed ) , also lost least contrast ( tamron somewhere middle , ed worst ) , ed tamron lenses both appeared kill color very slightly ( not big deal ) . only ed showed purple fringe w/ high contrast . but although 70-300 ed wasn't stellar these tests , i still prefer it backpacking due low weight size ( robustness ) , i rely 80-400 vr serious wildlife photography where i tolerate weight/size exchange image stabilization sharp optics .	1
one thing otherwise excellent stock lens comes d70 package telephoto not really very telephoto . 70 mm you just life size so you don't get much pull distance , if you're taking people pictures , you want something enhance faces more , give you more flexibility when shooting things farther away . this your lens . picture quality excellent it picks up where stock lens leaves off , so combination two lenses , you're going 18mm 300mm . picture quality excellent , what you'd expect nikon lens this price range . cons : it large heavier lens , it funny hood over front it , which i haven't able divine purpose , but it not obnoxious , f/4- 5.6 , you really need good quantity light it . but if you're looking lens give you magnification you find missing stock lens , then this it . price very good quality you're getting	1
just aware maginfication such it takes very steady hands , especially distance viewing . sure , you bring it ball game count players ' nose hairs , but field vision better suited fixed sky objects , long-distance spotting , or ( fairly motionless ) birds . tripod strongly recommended	1
i purchased these binoculars night sky viewing . i pair 10x50 bushnell binoculars i impressed what i able see through those so i bought these even more depth viewing they not let me down . they ideal supplements telescope or if you don't telescope , these great your first introduction optics open up night sky you . they much easier use than telescope you see all kinds neat things . i viewed such things orion nebula , andromeda galaxy , pleiades , double stars such mizar alcor ursa major relative ease they looked stunning . focus these binoculars milky way you tons stars you wouldn't able see otherwise . i even able look saturn some steadying binoculars against my chest , could slightly make out definition rings . these binoculars also magnificent job viewing moon . i read some reviews they really heavy bulky , but i found they surprisingly light easy steady free handed . they quite large , which means they take up more space than normal binocular , but this expected . mine come carrying case tripod adapter ( which i haven't used yet , so i cannot comment its quality ) . overall , price , you can't go wrong . i've used these binoculars daytime they great -- crystal clear optics . they also seem very durable some care , probably last you many many years . if you new stargazing considering good pair binoculars show you all kinds wonderous things , look no further than celestron skymasters -- you not disappointed .	1

i kodak easy share 7300 , which i loved , but pieces battery compartment broke off it wouldnt stay closed , so i buy new one . i spent few days researching cameras within my budget , my mom hp she liked it , so i decided try it . i love it . its so simple use , software easy install easy use once you try transfer your pics camera computer . i not yet tried print pic , but everything else camera wonderful . its small fits your hand , zoom decent , picture quality changes when you use max zoom , but pics still come out pretty good . only feature i dont like much when you looking through lcd display , when you move camera , its little blurry doesnt focus right away . everything else wonderful i am very very happy my camera	1
this my first slr camera . i'm pleased i choose sony a100 digital slr camera . i purchased sony 75-300mm f/ 4.5 - 5.6 compace super telephoto zoom lens it . i've taken wild life , landscapes , luna , celestial pictures . i amazed sharpness photos . i would recommend it friend .	1
there isn't much more say here . this superb little camera , definately worth 10 cnet , not 7.0 their review gave it ! they completely got it wrong their rating because this camera definitely deserves least 8.0 ! here , it also gets my 5 stars ! far pros go this camera ( 28mm wide angle , 10x optical zoom , 3 '' lcd , , built-in lens cover ) , it exactly good it sounds ! real life needs real life situations real people loves superb photos right camera capture those moments . cons side ( no manual controls , no zoom video mode , average battery life ) , those practically only things more advanced user would care . manual controls mostly expert photographers white balance exposure settings already this camera , so i don't know what else you need . zooming video mode isn't important me since i don't particularly take much video footage . i only say average battery life because i tend look through photos i already shot pretty often without using power save lcd , therefore , that particularly what drains battery . however , you usually get @ 250-270 shots per charge , without frequent previewing . panasonic basically taken original tz1 made it even better . there not much missing this camera . i've said , 28mm wide angle leica lens , 10x optical zoom , 3 " high resolution screen , excellent image stabilization , etc . all this fairly compact camera . panasonic also improved " noise " higher iso . low light performance much better than previous panasonic models . most important this , camera takes fantastic pictures . thing i'm extremely impressed construction finish alone . just holding it your hands it screams quality feels like tank . i love it . it seriously feels like $700 camera . no exaggeration . i little worried it not able fit my jean pockets before buying it . women may issues really tight jeans but us guys no problem . it fits fine . i seriously can't believe i carry around camera 10x zoom inside my jean pockets . truly remarkable . 3 " screen amazing . you practically enjoy your pics right screen without even printing them high resolution output . image quality great , if you need extra sharpness want " canon-like look , " you could always use camera " vivid mode . " it also not much bigger or heavier than your overpriced sony . plus , here , i found it three hundred , high speed 1gb panasonic card included . what better than ?! only accessory i buy now just dmw-ct3-k , leather case specifically this camera . you really can't find perfect digital camera , but this comes close you get . overall , i am extremely pleased . if you looking great zoom camera small enough form factor , you should seriously consider dmc-tz3 . this best compact camera i've ever owned	1
upgrading tz3 4yr old canon 3.2 megapixel . waited few months purchase when i heard tz1 updated . tz3 , panasonic fixed main complaints tz1 which : no build lens cover , noisy images higher iso speeds . imo , build lens cover alone wirth price permium over tz1 . others said , this camera great build quality , easy operation , high-quality look . i ordered black model pleasantly surprised when i opened box . it look retro 35mm cartridge camera , which cool . chrome ( or polished stainless steel , cant tell ) , first rate looks great matte black case . lcd huge bright . camera " simple mode " great job other modes fully customizable . zoom fantastic , but you need really steady hand full zoom , even optical stabilization turned . i take some surprisingly sharp shots zoomed way my car i came across herd deer . shot shot speed really great , unless you using flash . red-eye reduction works better than any other digital camera i used . overall , i am extremely pleased . if you looking great zoom camera small form factor , you should seriously consider dmc-tz3	1
i just received dmc-tz3a . i love this camera . this my first camera ever . i love features , build quality , menu system . i am still getting used learning how take quality pictures . example , i trouble getting it focus times . i am certain this just learning curve me . one feature i am disappointed it lacks - auto retraction lens when playback mode . most other cameras automatically retract lens protect it when viewing pictures camera . this one not this you turn camera off get it retract . i really wish they would update firmware support this important safety feature . all-in-all i definitely recommend this camera	1
i bought it go snorkeling , but after few days realize it very useful rainny days well protect camera . very very useful	1
usual , sony very good job case . last year i losted similar camera ( t33 ) skiing whistler because i didn't sport pack like this one . whole package stills very compact yet . very good stuff	1
this really nice point-and-shoot camera . outdoor pics really impressible clarity also quite good . only big problem i noticed this piece its night shot mode . since it not any outside flash , night pics not good expected sony . indoor pics also affected same problem	1
if you're looking style , size , picture quality easy use , then this sony camera one you ... this my first ever digital camera i must say sony never fails dissappoint me . only reason they didn't receive 5 out 5 stars because i sliver model i really wanted black model .. but it wasn't available	1
i love this camera ! it light easy carry , low cost takes great pictures . though i heard others say it battery eater , i able take over 100 pictures without needed recharge . picture quality awesome , even when printed 8x10 . especially such low price i very very impressed . i would most deffinetly recommend this camera those looking great everydaa use camera , great price	1
received item pictured no defects noted	1
not buy this camera $899 listed above seller ( maybe amazon might correct price after reading my review ) . it priced $299 or lower many online physical stores	1
digital camera owners product very susceptible obscuring dirt , dust , grime coating not only lenses but picture composition veiwing area rear camera . mavicas also more moving parts than stick storage ulilized others . this product greatly reduces cameras exposure these environmental threats . it thoughtfully equipped storage areas bungi straps . it very well made . it classic example form following function	1
it pretty good camera . its my first camcorder , i bought it because i baby october need capture everything , my nikon digital wasn't doing it me . optical zoom great , its pretty easy use , i love you just press finalize button wait little bit then play dvd dvd player . only negative thing price , it bit high , im not sure if its much better than other ones out there lower prices	1

i researched both pv-gs500 pv-gs300 . they same exact picture quality . these best quality camcorders you buy if you average consumer . if you amateur or aspiring filmmaker you need go higher end cameras . not even sony hd touch image picture quality these panasonics because it only 1ccd . 3ccd what pro models this gives you color rich professional looking picture . yes hd camcorders more lines resolution , but without richness color quality 3ccd , picture doesn't look good . pv-gs500 or gs300 can't beat any other camcorder it price range . drawback going hd or hard drive based camcorder you very limited when it comes editing . most editing software aren't even compatible hd yet . most importantly , if picture quality most important you , there no reason spend extra $500 pv-gs500 , just buy gs300 since they both 3ccd . paying more only gets you 12x zoom instead 10x , 4.0 mp instead 3.1 mp . $500 i live without extra 2x zoom 1 mp . i'm not buying camcorder taking still pictures anyway . also gs300 only 2.7 lbs which important taking handheld shots . gs500 4 lbs which drawback compared gs300 . if your filmming your kids soccer game handheld hour that big difference ! bottomline , panasonic needs come up more important features put into gs500 make it worth extra $500 . it just isn't!!!so that why i give th gs500 only 4 stars , gs300 5 stars .	1
great camcorder , excellent lens , image stability functions ... all package very functional ergonomical . zoom amazing . great outdoors recordings .	1
this battery pack , i make more pictures then before without changing batteries . i also better grip while taking pictures	1
i bought this my first digital camera . picture quality decent , there lot settings user tinker around ( though i haven't really much use them ... yet . ) my only problem this camera it eats batteries like candy . i recommend buying least 2 pairs rechargeable batteries , well fast recharger if you're type takes lot pictures . alleviate this problem , you option turning off viewing screen , which help conserve battery life	1
i found this great camera , not just it price . it simpl eto figure out how use , multiple settings cover any occasion picture takeing . i love it runs aa batteries . i bought cheap compact battery charger coming four rechargable batteries so all i keep both sets charged my camera case ( i don't keep batteries camera keep both safe leaving batteries there takes some their charge ) so wheni want 2 use my camera i put one set if set runs out ( but set lasts good long while ) i other set my disposal start chargeing dead batteries 1st outlet . this solved any problems might happened short battery life me . only other problem delay when you push button actual picture takeing . however this delay it focuses picture you so ur shots almost always turn out well focused , opposed friends camera who not delay but it takes many more tries get focused one . i love this camera recomend it anyone , especially first time digital camera users	1
perfect size well made . makes it easy compact carry camera battery extra memory	1

good product , it year now . wish i bought one jack external microphone . consider if you buying camcorder used recording teachings or other educational event . it good sound pick up but not good enough proper recording teachings	1

i bit worried this camera after reading bunch complaints lens error some other issues . maybe those early versions or bad batch , maybe design got tweaked ?? but i no problems all . i just came back two weeks portugal shot over 1500 pictures four weeks or so i've using camera it bounced around bunch . i tried get lens error ( before i left after i found " fix " ) but it never happened . maybe if you actually stop lens moving or pushed it back ? but would probably break most cameras . so either issue fixed or some users violently rough camera get error . images look great , it fast it great	1
camera takes good photographs . my issue its recharging system . it purchased cradle cp fx-a10 , after 9 months battery would no longer charge fully . i discharged nickel hybride battery fully no success . i purchased new battery ... same problems . not buy cradle , it waste money . i now recharge aa batteries external charger	-1

great single sensor mini dv camcorder . same sensor image quality more expensive models . easy use . great first buy families who starting video . doesn't leds night shots , although most case it isn't major inconvenience . sound good . pros : 1 . low price ! 2 . intuitive enough beginners . 3 . large lcd . 4 . good picture quality . cons : 1 . no digitizer . meaning no video . model up it , although it costs little extra . that major draw back form me . ( thus 4 stars)2 . cannot confirm it'll reliable over time . bought it too recently	1
first one i got amazon wouldn't hold charge , but they sent replacement within couple days no hassle or grief ! yay amazon111the unit exactly what it supposed , so reasonable clarity . keep mind pictures relatively small , so closer you take picture better you able see it screen . make sure your focus money you not disappointed . great way show off children grandchildren	1

i purchased this bag carry my hp photosmart digital camera photo printer , 100pk 4 " 6 " photo paper , power cord two chargers each hold 4 aa batteries , i still room left . i'm very pleased	1
i bought this battery back-up my canon sd630 . this camera no viewfinder so 3 " display always . there no problem using canon charger lenmar battery . i didn't time first charge , but i'd say it took hour . over next three days , i took 162 pictures 7 minutes video out recharging . half those pictures indoors flash turn . only reason i didn't give this battery " five stars " i can't yet speak battery longevity i only it few weeks yet . i'm very happy this battery . save few bucks buy this one instaed canon nb-4l .	1
bought these amazon only $7.99 . i bought two both equally good . i got 320 pictures 10 short videos one charge these batteries , which more than one came my canon sd630 . i only got 210 original so when i got 330 out this battery i estatic . only $8 what deal ! esp . when canon $50 . i got two these so i enough battery power over 800 photos before i need charge . don't know longitivity these batteries but even if they don't last long canon , i'm completely satisfied	1
battery this size , price great . i applied amazon credit card got $30.00 off which made price even better . battery works great so far	1
good news i got what i wanted this battery . i go all-day outings zoo , amusement park , or any place far ac outlet , just keep my camcorder turned without worrying running out juice . or , i use my camcorder battery power several days running without recharge battery . furthermore , battery level indicator back neat extra added attraction lets me see how much juice i left without use any process . however , this extra security comes price -- i don't just mean dollars cents . granted , none drawbacks i'm discuss actual show-stoppers ( come think it , dead battery literally would show-stopper , wouldn't it ? ) , but they're worth thinking if you want buy yourself some additional battery time you're trying decide whether buy it form this high-capacity battery or several lower-capacity batteries . first problem admittedly least important because you get around it simply either planning ahead or buying one those separate battery chargers job faster than camera itself . but if you rely camera recharge your battery , this baby takes long time go fully drained fully charged . no big deal if you remember start it charging night before day you need it , but if you forget , you can't start it before breakfast expect full charge time you've finished your eggsbut there one other reason why this lesser worry . unlike some other rechargeable batteries * , np-qm91d ** recharged before it fully drained no resulting loss capacity . my understanding if you try this some batteries , amount charge they hold point becomes maximum amount they ever hold again . example , if said battery originally capacity six hours you recharged it after using up only four , battery could then take only four hours worth charge , so would would only hold four-hour charge point . because np-qm91d ** recharged any time , you never let it fully drain once you've charged it , thus never long wait it fully charge after you've it once .. more significant drawbacks me come this battery increased weight size ... np-qm91d increased weight doesn't make camcorder uncomfortably heavy any means , but it shift its center gravity significantly , which took some getting used . but larger size np-qm91d , its resultant shape , what really causing me trouble . lower capacity batteries , such np-fm50 i'd using , slide nicely down into recessed area back camera , held snugly place until you release them because their back surface flush back camcorder . this higher capacity battery fits into same recessed area , but protrudes beyond back camcorder . yes , viewfinder extended accommodate this , i usually use lcd screen side camera anyway -- which i now much more readily afford because i don't need worry so much extra drain battery . but protruding battery it makes much harder connect ac power adaptor . more importantly , battery isn't held place nearly securely , because it long , heavy rectangle that gripped only one end . i've actually it come loose fall off back camera several times . one these occasions , meant i missed shot i wanted get because i reattaching battery . however , i admit this probably wouldn't happened if camera mounted tripod . so maybe real problem this battery intended professional videographers , i definitely ain't one . if you definitely ain't one either , you might want hesitate before buying this battery -- although , i said start , it helpful , despite problems . * such one my cell phone or my cordless razor . ** all sony camcorder batteries , most other camcorder batteries nowadays , i understand it	1
what it supposed . i use it sony dsc-v1 , no problems	1
nice zoom record button separate camera . tried using remote , but it zoom goes too fast looks jerky . only wish zoom button variable control like camera	1
i admit i am novice most part when it comes cameras , but this something everyone should ; mainly case but also extra battery . i climbing wall florence get picture dropped my sony dsc-200 ( while it carrying case ) 15 feet up it came through without scratch . even if you always carrying it around purse or bag , padding around carrying case great prevent scratches or damage . i know you get carrying cases less but extra battery great addition anyone who taking it vacation or worried running out battery power worth spending extra money .	1
price i paid amazon amazing . battery alone through sony style whould cost me 10 bucks more . case i got i gave friend mine cuz i ot my self aluminum case looks better takes duo cards , pouch i honestly say ok but i'm not using it i'll go friend mine . lives me battery which i constantly use rotate one came camera	1
i great experience . service pricing excellent . seller provided exactly what when . i would buy them again without reservation	1
really like camera . just little hard download . my brother-in-law bought one after using mine . but he got download kit sony recording videos(about $200 ) . money well spent . ok pictures , great video recording . best part , it 2 1 fits regular digital camera case ! zoom awesome this camera ! 30gb hard drive records forever	1
front compartment plenty room sd cards , batteries , other small accessories . my kodak dx7440 fits great middle , my phone fits it too . i spend alot time zoo , park ... go my 2 1/2 year old , so i just slip my id , money , credit cards whatever there too , it became my new little purse it not my shoulder , it right there my belt loop	1
this great purchase my purposes - birding wildlifing . i get used turning center-focus ring finger , zoom lever index-finger position . use full zoom , you really need total stability , but half zoom very useful even moving kayak . right-eye focus ring right up against eyecups hard move unless you twist open eyecups , which case focus ring fine . focus crispness not quite what i hoped full zoom , but still good seeing field marks . one big advantage light weight . this set light smaller nikon i lost . very nice	1
binoculars past either way too expensive or too cheap , i wanted new pair would replace pair loaned out , then lost . opportunity presented itself form trip canada this past september , which required something would able capture canadian rocky vistas , but also not so heavy i would feel like needing cart stow them . nikon eagleview binoculars seem fill bill ( not too expensive , but also not too heavy ) . they great zoom feature easily changed well able easily focus one hand . my only complaint while zooming subject , light level reduced , which occurs naturally due nature optics . you can't everything , but these just right , allowing my wife i use them time time again while observing nature . summary , good pair all-around use !	1
i looking case my canon digital glad finally find one amazon.com . case perfect ! not only it protect my camera but beautiful . red leather case gets lots compliments --- plus it matches my luggage ! thanks amazon	1
i am thrilled this beautiful red leather camera case . it fits my sd600 perfectly . just like camera , case stylish , elegant functional . leather rich red , it very well made . ( matches my coach red leather wallet wonderfully ! ) case features tiny pocket could hold extra battery , belt loop back , matching red leather wrist strap . case closes magnetic snap it features metal canon logo closure flap . great case wonderful camera . i couldn't more pleased	1
this case awesome . not bulky all nice shade red . not too bright , but not dark so it looks feminine . i love it . one small complaint - it little tight my sd630 . yes , i know it not advertised one , but it elph , so i thought it would fine . it fine , just little tight . it takes maybe two extra secs make sure case closes . i'm hoping case may stretch little use then it'll great . right now it tight fit , but it fits .	1
i quite few camcorders over years ( none them sony ) , when i looking new one , i my usual 3-4 weeks researching , etc . i chose sony dvd handycam because it easy use , menu pretty straightfoward , it 40x optical zoom ( compared 32x ) it dvd . i skeptical dvd part because i heard minimal recording time , etc but i didn't understand different disk formats i guess . anyway , i am very pleased this camcorder , able shoot 16:9 format also nice feature i didn't even think first . so , although i am new sony camcorders , i am really enjoying this one . my only advice would go ahead buy memory stick disk pack when you buy camera because you want them	1
i some research regarding this camcorder couple cannons . i picked this one because it usb port , 40x zoom , sold immediately when i tested it out local circuit city . touch screen easy navigate i use memmory stick my sony vaio laptop . only negative it not come any memory ; other than , it outstanding value . i highly recomend this product	1

i bought this camera my granson he alot fun learning alot how use it . i also saved 25% thru amazo	1
it works camera . this second lenmar battery i used . they not seem last long panasonic but good value	1
before i bought my fz20 i alot research not only what assecories get camera , but where buy them . read alot reviews . i ended up ordering1 . ) two equivalent panasonic cga-s002 camcorder/digital camera batteries ( same ones i'm doing review . ) i'll go concert , take hundred pics only go through one battery . panasonics offical battery costs around 40 something plus shipping handling if you order it online . i paid 50 altogether 2 batteries last just long panasonic ( actually bit longer then one they sent me camera . ) can't beat value . here what i also recommend : permaraal 72mm 62 mm adapter ($40 bucks ) 62mm filter uv filter your choice ($15- 30)(mainly protect lens , i keep it all time . ) 62mm filters don't affect picture or lighting quality , they're cheaper . plus you need least inch half long adapter so lens room move . 72mm one they send camera too long . also , get micro fiber cloth . i seriously recommend microtear . awesome brand . case , go tamrac , i got tamrac 5314 travel zoom 4 camera holster bag . fits perfectly even keeping 62mm adapter . when i want it off , i keep it bottom bag , no big deal . i got mine bhphotos 17 [ ... ] i suggest getting your camera butterfly photo , i got my fz20s 388 grand total 397.80 , no tax . if you get it best buy or circuit city expect end up paying around 550 . amazon ; 500 . look into getting tripod well , i can't stress how important they . if your not serious getting into photography i don't recommend fz20 . get cheap cannon dig ;) . or go compac series panasonic lumix brand . yah ones crappy lenes . hope this review helps	1
i used nikon 80-400mm lens my d200 first time last week my kids lacrosse game . before purchasing this lens , i little concerned some comments here autofocus slow react . i took 100 pics game , one slightly out focus . all other pics incredibly sharp . i think this great lens	1
bought safari africa large part based other amazon reviews - am very satisfied . contrary one these reviews i find lens quite light what it . only issue it really bit slow not ideal very low light situations . but it compact optics really great . highly recommended	1
only problem this video camera ( i mean only problem ) it wasn't color i expecting ( grey all over instead black accents ) . other than it amazing . granted , it doesn't take greatest quality video , nor it take night shots all , but if you're going buy video camera this price , you better not expect those things anyway . this camera perfect catching moments your life making fun little videos fun .	1
i like take pictures , my husband wanted camcorder , so when we saw this wal*mart under $100 we thought we'd give it try . i've using it my main camera little over year it isn't too bad just family photos . camcorder fun play , i sometimes use mp3 player . it worth money . however , eventually you going want better camera . indoor shots all come out slightly dark yellow . but don't expect get better camera this price . i am looking $300-500 quality i really want . i am trying decide if i give this camera my 8yo daughter when i am it . she budding photographer she enjoy taking videos , but honestly i think camera she now better quality than this one	1
it charges battery promised , quick efficient . it small easy hide . this makes it easy pack vacations adventures , however , it also makes it easy lose , which why i'm purchasing charger . go figure .	1
this order bit confusing . i tried repeatedly contact via email company shipping this item but they very slow responding my inquiry . turns out shipment already arrived but one my family members failed let me know it come where they put it . so , while it turned out there no problem shipping , or product , company slow respond my emails when i thought it not shipped . eventually after i sent 4 separate email inquiries i hear them they said it shipped i should received it . when i started questioning all 6 family members deliveries . i wrote company apologized letting them know i received it but never heard back them again	1

overall , this nice digital camcorder under $150 . my only complaint still images always look blurred when taken indoors . if you buying this taking still images , i suggest you buy different camera . i suggest you purchase sd card this camera , because 32 mb built-in memory just isn't enough fully enjoy this camcorder	1
i use this camcorder my own videography business never any complaints video quality . get better camcorder , you would literally pay twice much money . some people complained low light capabilities , my mind this one problem camera . you need find good camcorder light make up this problem . but images shot outdoors look similar quality my friend $2000 cannon camcorder ! if you're looking " pro-sumer " camcorder you're budget , or if you simply want top line regular camcorder , buy this camcorder	1
i quite bit research video cameras but i am no means expert . i selected this camera hopes image quality would lot better than my older jvc camera . although colors bit better , all you seem get 3ccd . i love small compact size well features ease operations . it bit uncomfortable hold my hand , it seems better suited someone smaller hands . i wish it built lamp low light	1
i actually originally went this page through google see if they still selling this model . i say this really good camera casual photography , even still good camera 4.1 megapixel camera ( considering you purchase 6 , 7 , even 8 megapixel cameras now ) . i bought this camera myself january 2005 , it reaching its two-year mark , still works close perfectly . it'd actually still working perfectly if i didn't accidentally drop it so many times hard surfaces ( more than three hard falls ! ) . my opinion , it takes great quality pictures , slightly above-average video if there good lighting , takes great pictures even without flash . it definitely better camera than my dad fujifilm 7 megapixel camera , too . i think my camera still year or two it , if i could less clumsy . i've also gotten lot comments photos i've taken . people said i really good camera , it takes excellent pictures . i used take lot pictures bands , they've always pleased them . it surprisingly well dim environments . lately , i've taking lot still life pictures fun , got lot good feedback quality this camera . there only one problem i this camera , however , it it eats up batteries really fast . i'm not exactly sure what considered good battery life digital camera , but i charge my batteries every day . overall , this really good camera me through concerts , parties , film shoots , landscapes , still lifes , amateur " artsy " photos . i'll incredibly sad when i part it	1
i bought this camera christmas 04 trip ireland . picture quality ease use great . battery life also very good . i took over 600 pictures my vacation almost every one turned out perfect . quality good enough flawless 8x10 print . i not any problems this camera . i also owned older model sony , nikon , kodak digital . this one my opinion best all them	1
this great camera if you're looking something basic . i bought it start videoing my baby , picture quality great . one thing though , this model doesn't " spot light " , so if you'll need extra lighting , upgrade sc-d363 model	1
this camera so much good looking you afford bad picture quality or bad power management . it not those who really concerned pixels zooms . it camera people go	1
it great when product just " works " . read manual get full benefit this great camera	1
you read reviews , saying lcd broke , other things just dont work . personally , i no problems whatsoever . yes i nice case padded we keep camera when we not using it , no i am not professional so i am not too incredibly pickey when it comes camera . quality great , eveyone enveys this camera who uses it . o also let me mention we this camera year now two kids handeling it times no regrets so far . pros : * small * sleek * exellent picture quality * great video playback * good in-camera photo catalog * durable ( this my experience .. remember 1 year 2 kids , good case . * good battery life cheap batteries , i bought 2 extra batteries like $20 ebay . * simple user interfacecons : * red eye could better this camera * get 7.1 mp version if you plan cropping pictures blowing them up large ( using picasa2 )	1
although i not used this tripod serious recording my old digital video camera , this tripod not difficult connect into my digital handycam . i tried it once after christmas it so easy . i should bought this long time ago . i got this tripod one my christmas presents .	1
this product deserves 5 star review . tripod itself very sturdy , supports wide range heights ( including its lowest height which works nicely macro shots ) , it light compact ( which makes it great travel ) . top off great price , you've got great tripod . here why i gave it 4 stars : product accessory list categorized incorrectly sony website . if you look up cybershot dsc-n2 , click it supported accessory list , vct-d680rm remote control tripod listed ( currently , writing this review ) . furthermore , if you open sony description vct-d680rm remote control tripod , it directly lists dsc-n2 compatible . note dsc-n2 only half compatible . it fit just fine tripod itself , but it not work remote control features . dsc-n2 doesn't acc jack , which necessary make use tripod remote control features digital camera . i've called up sony discussed problem , they agree product mislabeled . they've very helpful far customer service goes , considering fact i didn't purchase tripod directly them . they even offered full refund product directly them . hopefully they'll update their website soon so this doesn't confuse anyone else . this why i'm giving tripod 4 star review . tripod itself great , but documentation incorrect . note , this still excellent choice tripod . if you're willing spend more money , you upgrade vct-1500l tripod , which give you extra 2 inches high low end tripod , but i found vct-d680rm gives me plenty flexibility travel accessibility , saved me some money . even without use vct-d680rm remote control features , it still excellent tripod , especially amazon price	1
tripod well built . each leg 4 sections , not 3 . this tends help strength stability . controls handle make capturing video very easy . it not professional tripod built 40-pound cameras , but it very easily handle any sony consumer video camera . only minor drawback speed zoom through handle little tricky manage . however , if your tired cheesey cheap tripods sell $30-$40 , spend money this one . it well worth it	1
sony cybershot great camera . colors features amazing . very easy use . only thing i dont like camera zoom out button . if you zoomed you wont able zoom out .	1
sony w55 followup successful popular w50 . it very good compact camera , easy carry easy use , reasonably priced - so most people happy it . not much changed w50 , which this case good thing ! one change w55 7 mp camera , rather than w50 6mp . honestly , that not big plus , they haven't made sensor catches light any larger . same ( good ) lenses , same size sensor = same ( good ) pictures , but not better . ( though it might help little features like smart zoom . ) obvious change course colors . don't make too much fun ! there 4 dsc-w series cameras our family , colors would kept my mother-in-law taking my sister camera home her . little personalization good thing . internal memory expanded ( 56mb ) , but i've never used internal memory cameras it , so i'm not sure matters much . it might worth knowing how use backup , dozen or two shots if your card full , or you some other problem . controls , menus interface w55 reasonably easy use . example , w55 easy access various scene modes ( twilight , etc ) , some explanation screen what those mysterious little icons mean ( so you might actually use them , since it tells you what they ! ) . if you're new digital photography , there learning curve . but if you've used other cameras much , especially sonys , you pick this up use many features right away . read short introductory guide comes camera , though ! rechargeable battery should easily last you full day shooting - hundreds shots - no problem . ( little wise turning it off when you're not using it ! ) so you probably don't need second battery , unless you're going into woods while . it nice not mess bulky aa rechargeables . also , lithium ion batteries don't memory effect , so don't worry partial recharging . just charge battery each night . so - before getting second battery , try it while see if you need it . but get case - something protect screen , least . fully closed one might help resist rain splashes little , too . you'll also want get memory stick pro duo card - pro cards faster , you need smaller duo size this camera . get 1-2gb card so you don't think running out memory too much - if you shop carefully , you find them so little these days it well worth avoiding running out memory . you might want spare card if you plan travel more than week , or use video mode often - which surprisingly good ( though bit dark ) if set fine , but uses enormous amounts storage setting . you stretch your memory , your hard drive space , using one lower-resolution settings take snapshots . you don't really need 7mp all your photos ! w55 take better photos than those credit-card type cameras tiny lens system - optics always make difference camera . any reasonable person very happy pictures w55 , given size it . camera little slow often take disappointing pictures low light dark situations . try high iso mode low light no-flash situations - picture quality suffers some , but most people find it useful . realistically , no ultra-compact camera work really well situation - if you need often , think something bigger lens bigger sensor . good light always gives best pictures any camera . there limits what you currently expect any ultracompact camera . w55 offers enough controls ( through scene modes program mode ) allow fair amount control over pictures , automatic camera . charger fairly compact rated 100-240v , so while you'll need plug adapter overseas you won't need voltage converter . battery charger little slow , though probably ok . keep this camera charged handy , you'll find you take lot pictures because it easy carry easy use	1
i own various digital cameras , cheap point shoot pricey slr small camera , this one great . 10x optical zoom camera fits your pocket awesome . i took it wildlife sanctuary 10.3 meg slr , pictures this camera almost good those taken 300mm zoom slr ( least 4x6 8x10 , i didnt try anything bigger yet ) . easy navigate screens , loaded options . i would definitely buy it again . dont let other brands 3x 5x optical , plus digital zoom fool you . digital zoom degrading pixels . this one buy if you want camera fits your pocket zoom close .	1
this best digital camera i've owned . first , i believe camera should fit into my jeans pocket so it me when photo opportunities arise . it not smallest camera market any means , but it fits comfortable into my levis . i use this camera all time . second , zoom amazing . 10x optical zoom camera fits my pocket ! because camera built image stabilization , deeply zoomed pictures look terrific . third , my wife finds it easy use . this says lot . i'm techie , but she thinks dials menus intuitive easy / quick use . fourth , camera takes 16:9 aspect ratio movies ( or regular 4:3 if you prefer ) . image quality much better than i expected . image stabilizer probably helps improve quality , but i played videos our 42 " tv . quality appears just good our normal cable signal . definitely not hd , but good enough share short videos friends tv more than sufficient emails youtube postings . fifth , we very pleased image quality . because we amateurs , we take pictures under all sorts less than ideal conditions ( low light , moving subjects cameras , long zoom shots rocking boats , etc . ) . this camera sharpness , colors , details better than any other digital cameras we've owned over last ten years . pro might not satisfied , but we . sixth , it works great iphoto , mail , iweb , imovie our mac , so sending pictures or videos via email , making webpages them , or editing them into movies / slideshows very , very easy . battery life sufficient , but i would rather it took standard batteries ( aa or aaa ) so i wouldn't bring charger vacation . charger small , but takes valuable space tight suitcases . first , i not thrilled manual lens cap . however , i veiwed this camera store before buying amazon . salesperson convinced me integrated / automatic covers provide less protection likely places mechanical failure . big lens lets lumix pull such massive zoom definitely needs good protection .	1
bit more info program . it exist . it free . you send your camera or , if big city , take it repair center free replacement . it not matter if your camera out warranty . replacement program exists other countries well ( least uk canada ) . jvc standing behind their product you really respect them .

what i've read some reviewers i might not bought jvc . now i'm glad i . taking time learn pros cons various menu settings allowed me avoid all pitfalls they encountered , especially low light shooting . if you shoot electrically lit areas , not use nightshot or auto-a menu settings if camera or subject might move . use agc setting . autofocus image stabilization only work well dim lighting using auto mode , not manual . color balance videos outdoors slightly toward " cool " end spectrum , but made perfect doing manual white balance ( carry pure white card set it ) . i not encountered any unsurmountable problem yet . only negatives so far ( 7 months use ) addition what i said above : if you power camera it high zoom setting last time , autofocus problems until you zoom out ; front led light little use , it creates keychain flashlight type illumination , bright center dim around edges ; wide squeeze mode 16:9 only good if you never want make copy 4:3 tv . best points : excellent color quality outdoors acceptable indoors reasonable illumination manual white balance , small easy carry , battery charges quickly it life ok i don't use lcd much or leave camera scenes ; good optical zoom range but you might need wide angle converter cramped spaces ; sound quality adequate unless you're recording musical instruments want precise accuracy . suggestions : buy 30.5 -37mm step-up ring , uv filter proper lens hood . it fits snugly roots n5 bag ( belt , hand , shoulder straps ) , available photo stores , leaving room extra tape ( or two or extra small battery ) , a/c adapter white balance card	1

this little unit take anywhere camera job just anything . kids easily use it , back screen large enough you really see what you shooting without squint . menu structure basic but adequate . i seen this unit priced alot more other places high reputation but once again amazon its other retailers come up goods . thanks	1
price , you really get lot neat features : mp3 playback , short video , decent pictures , use sd cards , rechargeable battery , so . regrettably , quality hardware leaves lot desired . buttons flimsy scream " fragile ! " i've exchange my device twice , each worked less than 2 months before failing . i not know if there quality control problem : some units work described whereas others simply fail , or if there quality issues across board . either way , you may want consider spending few dollars more buying separate camera mp3 player ( ipod shuffle only $69 ! ) ...... you'll get same functionality much better quality . -- dad 2x disappointed son :	-1

i got this after switching digital camera . digital cameras didn't offer depth i wanted not proofs big drawback . i am no means expert photography , but i know great photograph when i see one , this camera takes beautiful shots . this beautiful camera . elegant design ; grey body black accents definately attention grabber . people look your camera . it definately brains back up it beauty . loading film easy quick . it 8 or so presets . there automatic " point shoot " mode which you'll probably use most . it automatically compensates light , adjusting shutter speed aperture perfect shot . quick autofocus allows you grab your shot quickly , without waiting camera decide take picture . it also settings portrait shots , close ups , night , landscape , no flash , many others . those settings maximize camera features those particular shot . it also program setting where you program shutter speed , aperture , flash film advance . though comprehensive presets , i don't think you'll ever need use it . 28-90 lens comes kit nice , selector autofocus or manual focus . it also , course , removed so you add other lenses . zoom powerful leads beautiful shots . overall this unbelievable camera . great price , features , pictures best you've ever seen . they very crisp , clear almost 3d lifelike quality them , something i've never seen outside professionally taken photograph . this camera awesome	1
i looked digital cameras months - literally - before i just decided lug around 35 mm slr . everyone probably already knows , megapixels matter whole lot when you're talking blowing picture up larger size . what great film unless picture taken out focus , or bad light , you use negative blow something up quality really doesn't start go down until you're making huge prints . ( how huge exactly i don't know , but biggest i've blown up around 4x4 feet , still no trouble . ) prints i've gotten out this camera so far stellar . ( i use fuji film -- i think it better than kodak , even though kodak better commercials . give it try ! )the camera itself not too heavy , granted , it not convenience tiny digital camera , but it not bad i'd expected carry it around all day . neck strap nice , manual actually easy comprehend . i like camera buttons lot it features body -- it seems complicated first , but once you know how use features , they're much easier access than they would if you scrolling through menu . t2 seems worth hundred or so more dollars than you would pay very similar rebel k2 canon . one thing - make sure you take batteries out if you're not going using it week or more . it seems like they go dead if they're camera , even if it off	1

this my second fujifilm camera . i recently bought this one after my dog ate ( yes ate ) my older one ... i pleasantly surprised quality pictures i taken this camera comparison my older camera ( not sure model but it 3mp ) . i'm also not photography guru , perhaps thats why i like fujis , they pretty self-explanatory . outdoor shots shots right before sunset seem best !	1
perfect holder my hp camera . love magnetic clasp . though i removed wrist strap , it nice option ( i'll simply use actual camera strap toting ) . sleek look , extra pouch inside case hold extra memory card nice bonus	1
i really hedged sky caddie rangefinder . i've used both now convenience sky caddie hard beat constant readout yardage . however , given fact i often find myself " unique " locations any given course , there much said able shoot specific target get distance , which sky caddie doesn't allow you . sometimes you need odd distances lay ups , getting ball back play , etc . short , i would recommend this product . it easy use , appears very accurate . definite time saver course	1
i use this golf yardage when i'm location where yardage hard determine . very accurate . require steady hand . would not recommend more magnification than this one it would very difficult hold steady enough target small flag	1
ignore all glowing comments this product . resolution terrible , even fully cropped mug-shots just person face . you hold device arms length just make out some images since they so blurry any closer . save your money this one .	-1
excellent transaction . seller quick communicate ( automatic process ) , they delivered product fast safely . so far , it working great . thanks	1
i sony digi camera some time . i found features difficult use one carry manual around you reference . while pictures excellent general , i often failed get shot i wanted due some adjustment i forgotten or couldn't otherwise access . delay shutter excessive . then one day , camera ceased focus . sony wanted excess $200 make repair i decided look alternatives . this camera result i love it . menus very well thought out there onboard instructions everything . camera comfortable size . pictures sharp mechanism reliable . battery life amazing . size weight very convenient . shutter delay very short . best all , wifi feature dream . once you get it set up , you push botton pictures your computer without wires or hassle . ( you disable microsoft xp firewall however . ) i feel going company making fine cameras forever choice i should made beginning . i am buying two more similiar nikon model my children who off college fall .	1
this camera best digital camera i ever owned . very active person , i needed camera would hold up anything . waterpoof , shockproof .... everything proof ! it compact size makes it great sticking your back pocket during night out town , or packed away your backpack while traveling world . large screen makes easy viewing your pictures all functions very easy use understand . this 7.1 megapixel camera taks great pictures aren't too large so they don't take up too much memory which makes it espescially easy upload your picutres onto social networking sites without reformat them . you definately get your moneys worth buying this great all around camera .	1

lot already said there some excellent reviews here ( well elsewhere ) , but i just want add my 2 cents . i purchased this guy few months back , since purchased light second battery it ( i'll talk those shortly ) . my favorite features include : 1 . 3.5 " screen , which should must any camcorder , 2.5 " screens common today worthless imho . 2 . sliding door accessing hdmi port well other video ports . this unique sony ux1 sr1 hd camcorders ( far i tell ) best implementation i seen cover uncover ports . much better than little plastic plugs inevitably break-off lost . 3 . beautiful , detailed video . my least favorite features include : 1 . stupid little plastic cover plug power port . mentioned above , this camera great sliding door all its video plugs . inexplicably , sony used plastic plug power port , which right next video ports could used sliding door . stupid . mine already threatening break . 2 . short recording times . it hard blame sony short recording time dvds . this just fact life short time isn't limited hd dvd camcorders but it problematic all dvd camcorders ( though less so than here ) . you make choice you live it . while lots reviews mention dual layer dvds out there , they much more expensive i don't even really consider them option . luckily , lower quality modes still look very good , especially when taping outside . lower light situations , i would use higher quality settings . still , all video i take this thing looks better than any standard def . stuff you may see . also , related dvd issue camera insists popping up little comment saying it recommends sony brand dvds every time i put any other brand . this completely annoying sony should rethink way they try lock you their own brand . 3 . automatic lens cover . not bother cover great little addition this thing . features i thought i wanted but could lived without : i haven't yet used focus ring or mic or headphone out yet . i really wanted these , but retrospect , they unnecessary my home use . mic this thing plenty good , i just don't want mess focus end day . other notes : i purchased light extra battery here amazon couldn't happier them . light sony hvl-hl1 battery same one comes camera , sony npfm50 . light just right give boost indoor recording makes picture much better low light situations . it only 3 watts but seems very bright . it attaches hot shoe top camera . it priced right works flawlessly . grainy picture mentioned many reviews , i haven't noticed anything distracting . every camera positive negative aspects , but i am more than happy quality video this thing takes . i give this camcorder 5 stars not because it perfect , but if you weigh price features , i'm not sure there better hd or sd camera out there right now . it would not worth list price , but price they it now , you simply can't beat it , long you live dvd format . if dealbreaker you ( it wasn't me , obviously ) , it dealbreaker , but otherwise , this far best buy this price point	1
but you need very fast pc playback . 3ghz pentium 4 or equivalent simply won't cut it . i get jerky poor video my single core pc but problem fixed soon i move video my dual core amd box . keep mind avchd playback software so demanding both cpus running 90% utilization during playback . conclusion : there no way single cpu system pull it off . people who complained recording time mac incompability , those design technical limits . i am prefectly happy 15 min hd recording time per minidvd . if you need longer recording time , you should buy hard drive or minidv based camcorder . mac incompatible ? buy pc . they cost less than mac accesories .	1
this item one get . it roomy very durable . it stands tought nature wear tear some cases unavoidable . not mention this go almost any camcorder plus you know sure you getting best i quality because it made samsonite . i advice you look no further than this product	1
this good basic tripod . much sturdier than many others i've seen this price range . smooth controls . very easy use easy our children ( ages 10 13 ) use digital camcorder . comes two parts connect camera stand , so you pre-attach connections two different items ( e.g. , camcorder camera ) quickly attach detach each tripod needed . level works ok , but not positioned clearly not large higher end ( higher priced ) tripods ( e.g. , bogen ) . overall , good value price	1
great camcorder bag , just right size . i especially like detachable storage items you don't need your outing .	1
this really isn't bad everyone saying . compared what you get standard most cameras , this mic great job picking up dialogue . just point shoot . i'm pretty satisfied	1
i bought this year ago taken many great pictures it . it light , many features used automatic when all you want point click . i can't recommend it enough .	1
kodak makes great film , gold max one their best amature films . this film provides maximum versitility outdoor sports , decently lighted indoor shots . grain structure good , holding well up 8quot ; x10quot ; print . best part this film price ... i think kodak amazon.com real winner here	1
we pleased our new panasonic camcorder . we only used it few times christmas , but pleased picture quality . we knew looking different models store we wanted joystick operation only panasonic seems use . it could not more simple move choose options functions . image stabilizer works well image looks good even 10x zoom . many reviews stated , under very low light conditions you loose picture quality , but we found case lots cameras friends ours . we upgrade our computer drive read mini dvd-rs , so i cannot comment software yet . but we love menu funtion playback , no fast forwarding or rewinding , just shoot , finalize , put it dvd player choose what scene you want watch , it very simple . us simplicity not convert over tapes every time worth cost mini dvds short record time ( 20 minutes per disc ) . we very happy camera so far	1
this my first dvd camcorder i absolutely love it ! it also my first 3-chip video camcorder . image quality just really good , like other guys said . machine also apiece cake use . i e-mailed " gadgester " he recommended tdk 8.cm dvd-r blanks amazon , so i bought them now i just pop one go ! no formatting needed . finalization camcorder needed make dvd-r compatable my sony dvd player home well my thinkpad . one gotcha look out slow start-up times , power off . it takes anywhere 5 10 seconds camcorder ready record , after you insert yoru dvd-r . if you use dvd-rw , manual says it might take up 20 seconds ! other than , i no problems camcorder . it high quality , i just love conveneince well image quality .	1
i got my canon hv20 yesterday . just post several problems after testing it . 1 . handling . handling quite awkward . my hand feel very uncomfortable when holding it , it alway slips . i use other hand adjust it time time . also it quite hard switch camcorder when using only single hand . 2 . building : this camcorder not sexy previous one . it not cute , it not professional . but given its excellent video quality , this ok . 3 . noise : i shoot some video indoor 300w light bulb , i should say light fairly enough , but when i play it back using my 30 inch lcd monitor , i still find quite bit noise although their grain size not big . i tried " neat video " plug sony vegas reduce noise , it seems work pretty well . 4 . manual control . manual control part part really disappoints me . because i used lot photography . manual control this camcorder far slr camera . especially manual exposureit funny . say when i shoot video bright place , i set exposure -1 , then i moved dark place , then video very very dark . this means when you adjust exposure , you adjust its " absolute value " while not relative value . it doesn't mean you get less exposure all time . slr camera , if you adjust exposure -1 , it means no matter where , camera measure light then decease light coming relatively -1 its measured value . 5 . thing i recommend when you use this camcorder , try adjust contrast lower level , brightness lower level , no sharpening . this definitely give you lot flexibilities post editing	1
i work local camera shop , we just ordered few these cameras . i've chance test it out over past few days , i am quite impressed . i've worked many different video cameras over years , including few high-end cameras such canon xl2 panasonic dvx-100 i think it safe say hv20 best video camera you buy under $1100 . it comparable other hd cameras other brands such sony panasonic , but there few more professional features enable it rise above rest . main feature it got me so interested camera its ability shoot 24 fps progressive . normally , this feature could only found cameras starting $4000 above . this very cool feature , it lets you shoot feature movies look like film , achieve quite few effects only 24fps . feature i found quite useful ability switch variable fixed zoom speed . this let you zoom set speed , no matter how hard you push down zoom button . there countless other features this camera , but i suggest you just try it out yourself . without further ado , i think i'll get back admiring this wonderful camera	1
i bought this gift so i can't say personally how good it , but recipient stated she loved it . especially ability change frames match her decor it came remote	1
i got this my mom when i got digital frame my husband it very easy download pictures she show off all her grandbabies this awsome gift anyone color pictures great	1
great gift idea . easy download pictures use afterwards . just use close up shots able view them easier	1
i love this camera ! i looking buy new camcorder since my old jvc one broke . i got this one because sale price , but i'm so glad i . video clear , it lightweight , small . basically everything i'd want camcorder . obviously i'm not using any professional kind stuff , but family vacation filming , its great	1
fine 35 mm camera , simpicity design ; photos turned out beautiful . camera which very easy use . diane carde	1
this great little camera you take go . it so easy use . i several cameras , but i find myself grabbing this one when i'm running out door think , " i should take camera . " i like way cover slides over protect lens . when you open , it turns it you're ready go . zoom adequate 95% shots i want take . photo quality very good compact camera . i like mine so much , i just ordered one give christmas present	1
found out i use little liquid lubricant adapt my zoom lens adapter . minor issue , works great . highly recommend zoom , remember adapter or zoom not mount	1
this product worked exactly it supposed . i tried using cable came camera ( usb cord ) found out exactly what many others said blogs ..... it doesn't work !!! once i got this cable , it worked perfectly . i able easily download video my camera my computer . only frustration i i would rather paid little more camera gotten this cable it first place	1
this battery stays charged long period time . i two them so my camera always ready use	1
i cannot evaluate this product now . it item i bought use reserve it not used yet	1
i bought this battery spare my kodak z760 ( excellent camera ) , now i use 5001 more than original 5000 ( which now spare ) . it better battery far . its longer lasting charge means more pics , charges same time 5000 . i would buy this battery [ ... ] again , no second thoughts . price right , too ! definitely 5 star winner	1
this camera works very well . it small enough fit my purse ( size my cell phone ) it takes good pictures . zoom works good preset settings nice too . panorama effect nice bonus fact you don't spend time putting couple pictures together . i would definitely recommend this camera if you're looking something small compact always around	1
this great scope beginning astronomy -- beyond . it sturdy simple operate . it enough light-gathering power ( more important than magnification ) reveal dim star clusters , nebulae , galaxies good enough optics show you surface planets like jupiter , saturn , mars . affordable this scope , there no reason give so much glance trashy 60mm refractors exaggerated magnification claims litter market . some advice selection . dobsonians come range sizes ; bigger instrument , more you see . long-focus 114mm ( 4 � " ) like this one fine instrument , especially children others whose ability carry large objects limited . teen or able-bodied adult should consider going up 150-200mm ( 6-8 " ) scope . bigger dobsonians ( 250-300mm above ) too heavy bulky some people . some advice use . viewing through telescope less like playing cd more like playing guitar . finding objects takes little bit practice . simplify it , i would suggest supplementing finder supplied this scope " red-dot " finder aid initial pointing . you also need buy star atlas ( sky telescope pocket sky atlas best available ) , red flashlight read it without blowing out your badly-needed night vision , guidebook lead you interesting objects . these investments greatly add your enjoyment . what more i say ? this kind scope experienced observers trying steer novices towards decades . although , i recommend you your homework before buying any scope -- learn sky get know experienced stargazers who advise you -- when it comes time purchase , this scope fine choice . more advice , see my encyclopedic guide here amazon , " so you want buy telescope .	1
this , quite simply , one best buys smaller , portable dobsonian newtonian reflector scopes today . usually , two terms ( portable dobsonian ) mutually exclusive , but 4.5 weighs only around 22 pounds , which makes it quite portable , pleasure operate turn point its dobsonian base . i owned xt 4.5 xt8 . both phenomenal pieces gear . both capable deep sky views . used both , i assure you 4.5 capable clear views up around 200x . it even able handle increased magnification barlow lens high power eyepiece , utterly stunning close up views lunar surface really clear night ! saturn rings ' cassini division ' easily discernable well . course it won't rival views larger dobsonians , but 4.5 holds its own real , well crafted , quality telescope . adult bend down bit viewing , but i solved challenge simply putting scope milk crate , or using small , portable folding gardeners chair , which low ground . no big whoop . all all , great tool viewing heavens your kids adults	1

this good product . i like way it automatically resizes pictures fit full screen . image quality excellent . it like always looking your photo album . one complaint - colored trim rings magnetic don't line up perfectly due magnetism .	1
this nikon charger works very well . it always pays off use charger camera recommends . this charger works very well charges lithium batteries quickly ! top shelf product	1

soy un principiante en esto de la fotografia , esta ha sido mi primera camara slr , por lo tanto me ha tocado experimentar con ella para obtener las mejores tomas posibles la vez que han aumentado mis conocimientos en el area , el desempe�o es excelente tanto en tomas fijas como las que he realizado objetos en movimiento , tanto sus funciones automaticas como las profesionales ofrecen un desempe�o excelente , he tomado mas de 300 fotos en poco menos de cuatro meses , el zoom que tiene es rapido , los botones tienen una disposicion excelente para manejarla con una sola mano , lo unico que necesita es un flash de la serie speedlite , tuve oportunidad de conseguir uno prestado de un amigo el cambio fue estupendo ya que este tiene mas alcance para el lente que la camara trae , ya que el flash que trae carece de potencia el cual ofrece su mejor desempe�o en los 28mm del lente(no le podemos pedir mas un flash integrado ) , por ultimo les dijo que posee el mejor sistema de medicion de luz que existe en el mercado ( e-ttl)y esta disponible tanto con flash integrado como con el flash externo	1
this much better than battery supplied camera but i prefer bigger battery available this really cool camera , jvc bn-vf733 . caution , don't fooled ( like i ) buying so called " compatable " batteries , they not work . money you think you saving better spent buying real thing . james hatsisjames1@oconeeairservice.co	1
i left my camera charger hotel couldn't get it back . this exactly what i needed . camera just sits right it . they sent it quickly it excellent condition . hint : now , i'm putting small tag my chargers so when people find it , they'll know where return it	1
using this much easier than charging my casio cradle . this i never need worry running out battery power since i charge 1 battery while using other . someone like myself uses my camera shoot video , this important	1
casio series digital cameras nice little cameras . too bad they ( some ? ) must charged through cumbersome cradle . get this travel separate charger . it bit pricey but well worthy it . i never even unpacked cradle my z750	1
this camera what it says it : it takes 16:9 pictures video 10.2 mp pictures ok resolutions video . it takes decent video , if you put it tripod . built-in stabilization worthless video mode you'll get palsy type shaking no matter what you . other words , this not replace your camcorder . picture mode , it good job most outdoors/indoors settings if you're not too picky lens distortions around corners highest resolution . this especially obvious if you take pictures where vertical objects appear near left or right edges frame ( like stop signs , light posts , building edge lines etc . ) all all , decent buy home use . not something look into if you'll frequently printing your pictures posterity or use professional publications	1
very pleased tripod - it very nice silky feel catches threads hold head place . i wouldn't call it ' heavy duty ' any stretch , but it handle my nikon d50 nikkor 70-300mm zoom it , without much problem . i used video tripod my camera it kept everything pretty tight steady , even long nigh t-t ime shots . this one same , but isn't heavy or bulky carry . however , if you older , heavier camera or use heavier lenses , this might not you . all-purpose serious amateur use modern cameras , it fine . pretty lightweight travelling fits very nicely bag , which i also bought ( separate amazon vendor ) . minor irritations - i probably could use few more inches this , i'm 6 ' 2 " , but it manageable . also screw plate fixes camera needs screwed down quite tightly prevent movement . otherwise all fine so far - very happy product vendor	1
i'm not professional photographer , i canon s3 lensmate adapter couple filters , that it . main things i photograph my artwork , friends/family things reference images/ideas ( objects , landscapes , etc . ) , this tripod works great all those . it sturdy , looks nice works exactly like it should . i don't drag it around me all time i treat it well , i expect it last me least couple years . if you pretty much just lot miscellaneous amateur photography you'd like something better than those cheap , generic tripods but don't want spend ton money then i'd highly recommend this one . i think it great i actually pretty impressed it when i opened it up . two things keep mind , it isn't smallest tripod world it doesn't come bag or strap carry it	1
i am not much filming specialist , but i am very happy this tripod . it very sturdy easy adjust . quick release camera mounting plate nice feature . price it good choice	1
awesome camera ! looks good takes good pics . only down side lag time pictures	1
only thing not like this camera included software . it what it supposed , but feels clunky little slow . i purchased additional sd storage card card reader . this allows you upload edit your images into your pc/mac using whatever photo program you prefer . other hand , if you going make use easyshare features such instant emailing photos , flagging favorite shots while they still camera etc ., then you need use supplied software . lcd screen large . it easily smeared fingrprints , but when camera turned , you cannot see this all . sold feel . picture quality outstanding , battery life good , it very trim . excellent macro feature . fast start up writes images quickly memory . no complaints	1
i bought this camera when my old one exact same brand model broke . i loved it too much try anything else !!	1
i wish i'd this adapter long ago . shooting video more fun because how much more i see it . my camera movement seems more fluid , too , because wide angle . i also seem able frame shots more interestingly because greater field view i	1
i recently bought this camera upgrade my sony 8.0 mp 828 . this my third sony slr-like camera , my first one 5 mp 717 . i upgraded this one order get photos clear sharp possible miniature items i buy sell . i found 828 when upgrading 717 , there significant learning curve over previous cameras . however , now my third sony camera , i've discovered learning curve lasts month - then one start taking photos good results . learning curve r1 predicted . out box , camera impressive , if only just size ! it probably double weight ( or least close ) 717 , probably 25% larger than 828 . lens whopping 67mm - full increment larger than 828 . next thing you notice camera lack lcd viewfinder , which sony took off camera placed adjustable screen top camera . quite novel . quick walk around camera shows sony learned cumbersomeness 828 regard adjustments camera made r1 very " user friendly . " camera easy hold ( though heavy ) one hand , photographer able make adjustments his other - definitely making it two-handed operation . it seems just everything button back or side camera , once you learn where everything , it easy change exposure , etc ., just quick adjustment . what i ( if you're planning use it photographing small objects , this something keep mind ) major initial drawback focus length camera . unlike 828 , where you could within inches object shoot beautiful closeups , this camera requires least foot , if not more , order focus . once you get it right focal length ( after purchase macro filter - must ) shots glorious . however , what long focal length detailed photos mean ? you must camera stabilized ( tripod , etc . ) order get good shots . hand-held detail shots no-go this camera . also , if you like take . mpg movies through your camera , you'll disappointed . this camera not capability . far plusses , camera super high quality , relatively easy use . lens fantastic , rest camera seems equal quality . i've gotten used lcd viewfinder , able use it some great shots i might not otherwise able view fixed viewfinder . i also add my wife gotten quite savvy this camera , which first her . she able get some phenomenal photographs , particularly portraits , thus far . she loves this camera ! would i buy ? i'm not sure . i'm fan getting new toys , so i it . however , i think my 828 may take better ( or least easier ) close up shots . i must admit i haven't taken this camera road trip just yet take outdoor photos , i only imagine lens processor it terrific . my word advice would : if you highest-end quasi-slr , then this camera you . overall , i'm happy this camera , but i just don't know if it might just worthwhile moving over quality slrs don't cost much more than this , such canon 20d . though i'll happily use this camera now am giving it five stars there no significant detractors i found it , i believe my next upgrade quality slr .	1
i this camera since july 2006 grown love it . see what kind photos it take , take look eric pouhier work pbase . i took it three week tour europe my 14 year old son august . i took two memory cards ( 1 2 gb ) also took 80 gigabyte portable wolverine drive which worked flawlessly ( i only used up 6 gb ) . wolverine charger no trouble working overseas voltages ( nor sony ) . if you're used travelling slr , sony pleasantly surprise you . if you're used travelling compact point shoot , sony seem huge . i also canon 20d slr which also great . i mainly use canon bird photography 300mm image stabilized lens . sony basically useless bird photography ( unless you extremely cooperative- or dead- bird ) . most other purposes , sony better than slr . it takes great portraits landscapes . it fabulous cities photographing buildings ( great wide angle ) . it also fun candid shots using lcd view finder	1
its good always spare your coolpix camera these things run out when least expected ( when you're nowhere near your charger ) . i would recomend buying one these keep your camera when out	1

i've using this camera over year . i'm pretty satisfied this camera - taking account both price performance . yes , lens not cover , but i've always careful it . number reviewers complained batteries - my case i not encounter such problem - provided batteries served well half year then i just bought new ones , no problem really . it perfect taking pictures you want send e-mail or post online - while previous generations digital cameras failed capture large landscapes or anything distance . high quality printing it would not good though . still , me it pretty good camera within its potentialities price	1

if you're looking all one lens , this good one take . weight conscious travelers who want just one lens keep all times happy this option tamron . upon getting it , i put it my 20d , it hasn't come off since . i took it trip thru se asia it worked great nearly all light conditions . some focus lag if you start longer focal lengths , but fixed either switching manual , or just patien t.t he long end good unobtrusive people pictures , while short end great capture some stunning wide angle shots . it also sufficiently bright get some decent handheld pictures low light . other pros zoom lock kept lens extending when you don't want it . flexibility wide angle zoom without take off lens risk getting dust sensor well worth it . other than slow focusing , there few things i think would make me consider switching it other than using lens low light photography . i'm not sure i'll ever use lens came my camera again ... anyone want it	1
i've canon digital cameras past two years my first , opted purchase accompanying canon camera case . though it good fit , it couple flaws caused me look elsewhere case when i got my second digital camera this year . this time around , i chose tamrac case because , unlike canon , it zips closed . canon flap closure creates two big gaps either side case , allowing small particles get inside camera itself . second , tamrac features not only belt loop , like canon , but nice shoulder strap . this means user carry camera hands free without put it purse or backpack . this case fits many small film slim digital cameras ( go tamrac website download spec sheet lists camera/case compatability ) , so don't expect custom fit . my canon a510 , this case bit long side , but no so much so i concerned it shifting around too much case . it good bag great manufacturer decent price . recommended	1
my experience amazon very good almost excellence . products like description specifications exactally functionality products . i brings my thanks you great services fast work complete orders	1

these binoculars amazing they completely crystal clear perfect size you going hiking or walking . i would completely recommend this product	1
these great binoculars . i've owned much more expensive binoculars truely don't see any difference . great buy . they 100% waterproof since i flipped my canoe they not affected any way	1
this charger exactly what supposed , very quickly . there cordless model bit more compact	1
it exactly original i got my camera i got adaptor car , 220 plug " " socket type . cool	1
i got this lens mainly low light photography , initially disappointed i could never seem get sharp enough results . this because wide open lens very narrow depth field . work within this limitation , or better yet stop it down little , it becomes amazingly sharp . focus little noisy , digital slr 50mm more like 85mm , but it fine general purpose lens	1
you cannot even believe this lens . every time i put it my d200 i kick myself using anything else . it just good or better , btw , than 50 mm 1.4 . this lens all others should measured should aspire equal . it basically costs nothing . p.s. i didn't buy this price . i also love my $ 2,000 lenses , but use this little one more , honestly . pps . there one other lens you may want consider lieu this : sigma 30mm 1.8 . equivalent 50 mm 35mm camera , captures more scene , still great bokeh ( sexy blurrying background ) . either way , you'll get stunningly great pictures all kinds light . , it also great discipline use straight lens rather than zooming all time . truly .	1
sharp , cheap fast 50mm prime lens . f/ 1.8 aperture allows you take great pics low light situations without using flash lens gather more light . good potraits , indoor weddings , fast action shots etc . small dof wonderful potraits bokeh also nice . it also comes 5 year warranty . lens every nikon user should own . far negatives , nothing complaint , though macro feature would icing cake . i use this lens my nikon d80 .	1
i've played this camera few weeks now zoom great . it various scenes choose help you take pictures different settings , lighting , scenery , etc . it works very nicely . i haven't installed software , but loading pictures my computer very easy . battery seems little high maintenance , but its just matter not storing it inside camera . overall , its nice , easy use camera snapshots novices , extra zoom makes it all better	1
i just bought this camera so this review might changing near future . what i love : - 8.3 optical zoom . enough said . -menu systems . they pretty self explanitory , though reading manual helpful , especially if your not electronics saavy . -lightweight . it lighter than my smaller kodak digital camera . -macro mode . my favorite feature . macro mode absolutely amazing . i love able photograph jewelry much sucess insects flowers . great feature alone well worth money . -the price . i got great deal my camera just 214.00 major retail store . i wanted something i could take sporting events without dragging around my heavy , professional slr . i think i've found it . -i like way it feels . this might sound little weird , but camera fits well my hands . it comfortable use . what i don't like : -size . okay , i'm not really conserned size , mostly because i drag pro slr almost everywhere i go , but it big downfall this camera . bigger bulkier than most camera it class . not easily able fit pockets or purses . -software . i'm really not fond picture project came camera . i'm big fan easyshare ( kodak ) software came my second digital camera . layout picture project just doesn't appeal me . -slow transfer . it took forever it seemed like transfer my pictures . i top line computer , so i know it not my computer . right before i transfered my nikon pictures , i transfered my kodak pictures they transfered much quicker . -rechargable battery pack 2cr5 batteries . i don't really any trouble battery life ( i'm actually amazed how good it ) but i'm just not rechargable packs . i like aa battery type . they easy find both regular rechargable . my real gripe this camera take throwaway battery : 2cr5 . they expensive . they hard find . they don't last very long .	1
this great digital camera . i no problems it . i got it my 1st anniversary 2 yrs ago . its great ! you take pictures , put xmas , valentines or birthday borders around them b4 you take picture . it video too , you play back video , but there no sound because there no speaker camera , there mic thuigh . so when you download video , it play sound too . camera survivied dropped many times . i would like take long videos , so i am going purchase 4gb sd card . i feel sorry all people i saw complaining camera because i no problems 2 years now . only thing batteries die quickly ( using flash really drains battery ) , so i went bought high quality rechargable batteries , or disposable duracell meant digital cameras . also people who complained blurry pictures , it depends what setting you camera . i not like all those different setings , they just mess up pic . not use auto feature i always use non auto , egulr pic , flash . all those other settings confusing . oh yes great self timer when you noone hold camera	1
i received merchandise working condition promptly , lowest price . i use amazon again	1
if you own olympus digital camera this smart way keep fresh supply batteries . it simple use fairly quick . it charges both aa aaa batteries	1
these binoculars awesome ! clear view easy focus . camera really neat feature easy use . photos clear , but little grainy side ( which i expected they would ) . all all - binoculars rock camera fun , even if it takes less than perfect pictures . i would totally recommend bushnell digi-bino 	1
this fabulous camera ! item description not it justice long shot . this my first digital camera before purchsing it i went walmart web site check out their digitals . 7.1 mp $50 more so i came back amazon placed order . camera nice large screen back previewing , 20 mb internal memory . this large compared others similar price . pictures superb quality . my grandson connected it tv slide show preview special effects like expensive video . i am very , very pleased this camera	1
i bought this camera take mexican vacation could hardly take bad picture , even night . our company travel agent even suggested i submit some our newspaper travel editor ... 10x zoom would nice but it seemed well , even whale watching -- i couldn't see what i taking due sun glare but pleasantly surprised pictures i got . i'm only little peeved because i bought camera amazon gold box special price gone down $20 since i purchased it	1

i just got f650 replace my olympus f-110 . senior , i needed something larger viewing screen . this fills bill . easy use takes great pictures . negative note , call fuji help when i started download my first batch photos . problem program not populating . glad i bought ac5v power adapter , which they recommend , but only state you could lose your pictures if battery dies . unknowingly , problem battery low . however , manual not tell you even though you connect using power adapter , it not by-pass battery . i removed battery there it , ready download . recommend people get power adapter when connecting pc , remove battery your set go .... bottom line , this great camera i bought online $150 ....	1

i really love this product . it works great i hoped it would . nightvision amazing . screen monitor small , but picture usually very clear . one my favorite features ability put it standby mode . then when baby makes noise picture sound come automatically . this way i don't it staring me face all night while i try sleep . but it comes when i need it . we 5.8 ghz phone 2.4 ghz wireless internet system . why i chose this monitor it works great no interference . we baby her room upstairs take monitor all over house it works great . it run out batteries pretty fast if you don't it plugged , but it not much problem us . we just take cord plug it wherever we need it . i am very pleased . i bit worried after reading some reviews baby monitors , but i am very happy we bought this one !	1
this best color print film there . it even better medium format size . just sure find minilab fuji frontier machine get proofs made . it not saturated enough those cartoon colors landscape photographers seem obsessed past fifteen years or so . but it gives consistent results fairly low amount grain my personal favorite color palette . everyone should least try it . it sure beats anything i've able get outta digital ( imho ) . alas , i'm not sure whether or not order it online . i always make sure get film says it packed usa canada . imported stuff may sitting hot shipping container long time .	1
i owned this camera since it came out market . i used many different digital cameras - i believe this one most user friendly produces very fine images . it well constructed- i take mostly outdoor/nature photos traveled extensively this camera it held up remarkably well . i spent over 8 months one year fishing boats bering sea ... no problems . this camera captured thousands images ( intervolometer option - awesome ! ) inside it waterproof housing while strapped steel gantry 100 ' ships less than ideal weather ... no problem . this camera went me top ecuador highest volcanos ... only problem lcd freezing - now there few ' spots ' it ... but hey ... my fault it wasn't exactly warm up there 20,000 ' so , yeah ... it nice tuff little camera . if you want see some my images ak , check out - [ ... ] you'll need click each underlined link ... course image size reduced save space .... check it out	1
i received merchandise excellent condition , new , time . everything promised . thank you	1
i bought fuji s6000fd december 2006 help me take better pictures experiment advanced photography techniques . initially , i mixed feelings this camera several times even considered selling it get " better dslr " . but after thinking long hard using it quite bit comparing its image qualities , i come conclusion it indeed excellent camera what it intended . camera now keeper . i use this camera mostly travel family pictures . below my personal views this camera : pros : 1 . picture quality : this generally sharp excellent color rendition ( i use " chrome " ) iso 100-800 . 2 . noise : this becomes evident only iso 800-1600 , but they still usable after running pictures through neat image noise reduction filter , 25% amount iso 800 75% iso 1600 . i don't use iso3200 because loss details . 3 . slr-like : this closest thing slr manual twist zoom , program mode dial comfortable grip/ergonomics . fixed lens comes nice looking hood allows use polarizer filter creative control . 4 . live view/histogram : this without doubt best feature this camera . i use it every time compose my shots adjust my exposure compensation white balance " get it right first time " . result , i am getting very high percentage quality pictures out this camera without much post processing . this dslr , you take shot first , then preview lcd , make camera adjustments then take shot again . live view , it close wysiwyg . 5 . focal range 28-300mm : 28mm wide angle provides excellent coverage landscapes tight internal spaces . i don't use telephoto range much but it there when i need it zoom details . 6 . face detection : it works , so i use all people shots . 7 . movie mode : this bonus feature , works well enough it replaced my camcorder . i get 30 minutes video 1 gb card . manual zoom works but you move it slowly avoid " jumpiness " lens changes focus . 8 . aa battery : i already use rechargeables , so not buy spare lithium battery benefit . 9 . price : ~ $300+ quality/features , this camera offers tremendous value . cons : 1 . no image stabilization : this potential deal breaker many buyers . but compared other non-dslrs noisy pictures iso400 up , shooting iso 800-1600 fuji s6000fd offers " compromise " which somewhat compensates lack real optical image stabilizer . but this 2007 , so i think it should requirement include ois any lens longer than 200mm . i personally don't use long zoom much , so it less issue . but it would nice if fuji include this feature its next release . 2 . no shallow depth field : this means you can't isolate subject creating blurred background , universal problem all ps cameras small sensors . fuji s6000fd , there some work around , such using telephoto focal length combined macro mode , but blur effect not good what dslr produce . 3 . limited burst mode : continuous mode slow buffer limited only 3 shots . if you taken lot action photography , then this camera woefully inadequate . 4 . electronic viewfinder : brightness adjusted up or down but resolution only 135k pixels so it not sharp . 5 . auto mode : this camera doesn't produce good pictures auto mode or even natural mode because tendency use high iso . those looking simple ps should look fuji f20 or canon models . conclusion : there trade-offs any camera purchase . despite my initial hesitation , this excellent camera offers close ( but not same ) what you'll get dslr . i recommend this anyone who wants learn photography but not ready invest dslr . this would " perfect " camera ( me , least ) if fuji included optical image stabilization ( 2-3 stop advantage ) higher resolution evf .	1
i received lens adapter timely manner . however , i need send it back because i mistakingly ordered wrong item .	1
i've this camera 4 months now i am very pleased it . pictures clear , focus quick options endless . this my 7th digital camera i purchased 2 close up lenses t-con 1.7 it which really made it versital . large manual zoom anti-shake best part camera . it very clear lens i like when focus manual it gives zoomed look what you shooting . fz-50 close dslr you get without all expensive lenses drag . manual settings let you set-up camera you personnel needs . i'm really enjoying this camera .	1
i'm former 35mm photographer who little older not spry i once i eventually got out habit lugging case equipment everywhere i went . i got re-energized photography digital but small compact point shoot left me wanting more . digital slr pricey friend pointed out i'd back lugging case equipment around me her . she recommended this model more i looked it more i liked it . it fixed lens model , but 12:1 optical zoom what other lenses would really need . it start up fast , zooms focuses internally so there no moving barrel hold . it just every feature advanced amateur could want . it macro . it optical stablization system works advertised . so far i haven't come across anything it can't . this nice unit advanced amateur or even semi-pro who doesn't want go full digital slr yet .	1
i am only amateur photographer , but still . . . this small camera long nose gives performance one might expect slr film camer costing lot more , lot more complicated use . i caught digital bug sevearl years ago . my latest before this beauty simple little canon sureshot 3mp . great camera , but this camera same simplicity , but takes pictures which much more refined terms sharpeness not much more than i paid camera four years ago !! this panasonic lumix leica lens , which ' matched any other camera but it twin leica camera -- much more expensive piece equipment . long lens might put you off if you average family photog , but if you want all around 35mm-12x camera without huge heavy expensive bag lenses , like me , this baby you . it only looks massive . it quite lite manageable . i use it bird photographsy , but it could great any situation where you need get really close up just any lighting situation ultra-fine resolution . don't want spend mega bucks mega-camera ? this answer . i love it , i think your , too . easy use , easy wallet . if you're not quite there , try next model down , same focal length but 6 mp , couple hundred less . terrific buy . no , i don't work panasanic . i'm retired print editor . jim isha	1
this camera exactly what it suppose : convenient , reliable , compact , user friendly above all else , it takes good pictures . if you want camera takes great pictures , you'll need buy something little more expensive , quite bit larger . i bought returned several cameras this class before realizing no camera this size , sub $200 price range perform way my slr . said , if you don't mind playing exposure compensation iso settings , you take some pretty great pictures even low light . i learned long time ago worst camera one you don't you when great shot presents itself . z1 you'll never excuse . even case it fits nicely my front pocket without protruding too noticably . only issues i it doesn't continuous shutter mode , dock required charging downloading images . said , i'm still giving it 5 stars because i said , it exactly what it suppose .	1
i bought this frame my wife . she alot digital pictures no good way see them all . after reading reviews others , i decided try this one . she loves it . little card reader we our computer , she drag drop her photos sd card . then just plug card , hook up ac power , turn frame . it goes slide show automatically . we didn't bother re-size or crop photos . 1/2 " black bars each side photo just aren't bothersome us . no remote controls or sound features but if you're looking simple frame just show off all your digital photos , reasonable price , this one great	1

well .... this my first camera ever i attest accurately advertisement holds very true most features . picture quality fantastic , special editing camera capable ( built-in templates ) , different modes camera positioned take photos . one weakness i want point out it could hard determine which mode take appropriate picture ( outdoors , bad lighting etc ) . therefore , i strongly urge you read instructions which state , " please experiment this camera before taking photos " ( basically i paraphrased it ) . other than , this camera rocks !!! advantages outweigh disadvantages far	1
ok if you know your way around camera looking nice slim shot camera just around . then this great camera . i very nice digital slr camera but i really wanted something i could just take me . i admit auto setting not best you get , but it get job . however if you switch camera over program mode you whole bunch settings choose . i am very impressed what this little camera . it far most advanced setting any slim shot camera i used . 7.2 mp , you never really need push this camera , your pictures probably turn out alot better if you use 6 mp settings . just because it might speed up shutter time processing time . i am really fan long-exposer pictures , but i find myself situation where i want take picture but i didnt bring my huge camera bag . this little camera take these sorts pictures . just put night shot setting push +/- button setting come up your good go . findiing your way around this camera quite easy . there not lot buttons so few hours experimenting you it down . dont bother reading manual doesnt really help . pmp camera , it nice touch . although if you apple computer putting movies camera take little work , but it . putting text files it couldnt easier just save file txt throw it your camera again you good go . since i mac i definetly use itunes but most my music protected mp4 format . this camera not play mp4 , just mp3 . again all it takes little work you get those song your camera . just find converter convert song you want put them different file you computer just . i would gave this camera 3 but advanced feature easy learning curve really jumped it up point . i love this camera it serve well anyone . dont worried pmp features taken away quality camera . it feels if this camera cut out solid block metal . one last note , just becareful shooting , although it very nice lens , it also sensitive time movements , but it not bad compared many other cameras . all them this problems so dont let this scare you off . just right settings this problem corrected . i love it . i love it . i love it . samsung headed right direction slim shot camera market . also check out nv7 nv10 if you want extra boost lens quality functionality .	1
it nice product price . very compact . good quality video my purposes . battery life problem . i've using it tape portions my son baseball games , recording 10 seconds time pausing ( when he batting or pitching ) it barely makes it through game	1
after reading all " professional " reviews , i decided try mg57 anyway i am completely pleased . it may not top line , pro video / coffee maker but it very competent video camera . manual actually useful although you dont need it . menus easy use " auto " camera takes very good video or stills . i chose this over mg77 because it video light ( vs . flash ) i dont expect take serious still pics it ( although stills quite good ) . controls menus really well thought out ( big change most gadgets like my cell phone ;-) size weight very good unit always ready use , just open lcd 3 seconds later you recording ! mac sw supplied trimming clips combining them into one file burning or opening imovie , this sw simple but easy use exactly what needed . this very competent little camera i expect get lot enjoyment out i t.p.s. most my video taken indoors best results i manually set white balance ( very easy ) . low light video quite acceptable me ( good my sony dc20 but without tape bother )	1
i purchased this camera year ago i no problems it yet .. it also light weight compact .... great product ..	1
very good helpful device . adds quite bit bulk weight . i would recommend you use it when you can't get ahold smaller batteries , or you going trip . vertical shutter release comes very handy . it comes down this , if you want more battery life you accept more bulk your camera . even battery pack my rebel k2 still weighs less than most digitals i tried out	1
when you take long exposure photo whith motorized camera batteries drain whith first picture ( four hours exposure aprox . ) , you wasted 8$ or more , whith this baby you take four cheap aa batts take same photo less $ , recargeable nimh batteries best choice , i take three hours half exposure whith this ones . last , adorama ship fast very good package !	1
i purchased these because i don't like taking my $100 binoculars football games rock concerts . these perfect . optics little cheap , but $20 , i think it steal	1
bushnell powerview 12x25 fine , small pocket-sized binocular . since my wife avid bird watcher , we already several binoculars various sizes viewing power . our grandson accidentally broke her small 10x25 bushnell we used trips , so i researched , then bought this one amazon her birthday . she loves it . viewing power bit greater than other every bit compact , which makes it easy pack vacations , yet provides good viewing experience when enjoying various bird populations around country . we both highly recommend this , other bushnell products	1
small compact . let me see everyting i wanted	1
my son bought this camera his own this past summer take videos his friends skateboarding , etc . his desire get video editing software add sound effects , music , titles , etc . camera works great what advertised . always keep perspective $300 something camera not match up features extras $1000 something camera offers . real reason my posting this message relates how connect this camera your pc download videos . this how it work . 1 . ignore usb connection stuff manual . good still picture transfer webcam stuff only . look page 43 manual : " pc connection dv interfac cable " . you must use this method transfer video . 2 . you need " firewire " ieee 1394 ohci compliant card your computer . i purchased added pci trendnet tfu-h33pi my 5 year old hp xl773 computer i also recently loaded windows xp . 3 . here key . i bought cheap sanmax 4pin 6pin 1394 cable . could not get camera recognized computer os . xp it should recognize camera soon you connect it turn it camera set playback mode . xp treat it like new hardware first time . i tried everything reload card software search online drivers through forums answers . then i remembered my neighbor video editing . i took my sons camera over his house his computer recognized pv-gs19 panasonic camera right away . i then plugged my sanmax cheap cable into his computer ... nothing . it cable . i borrowed his belkin shielded $25+ cable plugged it into my computer it worked . moral story . don't skimp firewire cable . they not all created equal .	1
this great camcorder . i've read people problems uploading video computer , but i not tried yet . we purchased camera film everyday things ( holidays , dog , etc . ) it works much better than i expected . zoom feature great -- i can't believe how crisp film things so far away . i've even used camera place binoculars our travels because you see everything screen so clearly . we also play back video car our way home travels enjoy watching it mini screen listening audio . most unexpected benefit camera how easy it take pictures film . we watch what we filmed tv just hit picture button snap digital photos after fact . it fantastic ! i really like digital camera camcorder one ; it one less thing carry . again , i can't speak computer upload film , but not everyone wants either . only drawback camera it doesn't light or flash . however , we haven't found we really needed it yet , we filmed lot inside out . i am so happy camcorder !	1
i received my cd timely fashion spent three hours playing it soon possible ! thanks prompt service	1
remember cell phones 80 ? that what this reminds me . it doubles weight camera . however , only other downside i now need carry extra tapes because i now film everything i want not worry conserving battery time . i burned through almost 2 tapes ( long play ) during day disneyland , used lcd screen entire time even play-back while waiting line . hindsight , i wonder if 2 4-hour batteries would smarter purchase , but would one more item keep track . cameras today so small light , large hands like mine benefit extra weight , but only point . summary : extra weight , but allows you completely forget time , concentrate shooting anything everything you want . michae	1
i used this camera pool get ready our family cruise . it works great . you need read manuel prior use follow directions . works great water case works great land very sharp pictures	1
shipping very very fast cost paper low enough they still beat out everyone else i could find net total price , even pay shipping	1
i am just average guy when it comes using camera . probably below average . i started trying use 100% sony electronic products because my computer sony sony-sony linkages make easy use . given , here what i think product : 1 . it amazing how much camera you get money . compared just 6 months ago , or year ago , this lot camera money . it very small , fits easily your pocket , but takes great pictures . also , it very easy use recharge . 2 . visit sony website , suggests sony new cameras coming out constantly -- new cameras very similar . this makes it hard compare cameras , even within sony brand , makes you feel if your camera obsolete minute you buy it . 3 . problem this camera , given it so small -- not shake . your pictures blurry . i am typical guy , very little fine motor control . my hands trouble holding small objects . holding this camera one hand taking picture -- well results not pleasant . 4 . i tend disappointed telephoto capabilities these small cameras . i guess if you really want zoom , then you go big camera . but it still seems like small cameras could offer more . 5 . said all , end , this camera small easy carry , light weight , durable , it also easy use . when you look it , it looks well made . i ended up giving camera my in-laws , because they lost theirs . my in-laws tend technologically challenged . i said them , just leave dial set little green camera , snap away . i say - they love this camera . overall . money , great purchase , technology amazing . just grab it two hands or develop steadier aim than i .	1
after using my friend cannon 30d its nicely sized viewfinder i cant understand why oly made this one so small . this magnification only helps , it doesn't fix problem	1
number photography review sites recommend eyecup magnifier olympus evolt e-500 i purchased it my e-500 . complaint e-500 view finder small compared other dslrs market . eyecup magnifier fixes this problem instantly ! i was/am glad i paid extra it ! i think olympus should include it standard piece e-500 package , obviously isn't going happen . if you purchase evolt e-500 only afford one accessory , buy eyecup magnifier	1
you get what you pay , great outdoors pictures using uv filter great color effects , also indoors using fl filter . bargain price	1
i extremely impressed this camera ; i felt only not exceptional feature its nonwithstanding aptitude steady shots . other than , i felt it fantastic , exceeded all expectations	1
i'd like share reasons why i bought this camera strongly recommend it : 1 . innovative design size . i absolutely love design compact size this camera . any other innovative products , form factor this camera received mixed reviews . i think it perfect , i no problem handling holding camera when filming . you give credit sony : there no other dvd camcorder market this compact , even after year market . 2 . media support . this should number one criteria when buying dvd camcorder . i read several reviews other dvd camcorders complaining issues finalizing discs or playing them standard dvd players . i no issues whatsoever discs burned this camera , finalizing discs very smooth process : one click few minutes . this camera supports dvd-r , dvd-rw dvd+rw . most dvd players play all these formats . dvd+rw format allows you view disc most dvd players without finalizing disc , while dvd-rw format allows you edit delete scenes disc when used vr format ( though this format typically supported dvd recorders only ); both rewritable formats formatted reused many times you'd like . note capacity discs 30 minutes sp mode ( or 60 lp mode ); this limitation size discs , not camera . you buy double-sided discs which allow you record 60 minutes sp mode , but you manually swap disc , so it equivalent using 2 different discs . 3 . it sony camcorder . i mention i not owned other brand camcorders , just because i've extremely satisfied sony camcorders . they not only cool design , but they also best terms ease use reliability . i cannot vouch quality this camcorder yet , but i expect this last , it seems well built . it also comes carl-zeiss lens , which among best market . 4 . other nice features worth mentioning : * usb cable allows you copy any or all recorded scenes your computer , even if disc hasn't finalized . * almost all functionality driven touch panel , main menu programmable which allows you add only features you use most . ok , so this camera not perfect , it some areas improvement : 1 . if you buying this camcorder take still pictures well recording video , this not your camera . resolution stills only 640x480 ( less than 1mp ) , quality so poor it not even worth using it stills . 2 . poor low-light filming no nightshot feature included . 3 . no upgradeability , because its compact size there not lot room attaching typical add-ons : microphone , flash , or headphones ( though you use adapter a/v cable ) . battery provided lasts 90 minutes , however you buy larger battery , np-fa70 which lasts up 180 minutes . 4 . original msrp $699 , this camera expensive , if you pay less than $500 this camcorder , you getting good deal . if you're willing pay over $600 this camcorder you're not crazy its design/size , you might better off buying dcr-dvd203 , least you'll get 1mp digital camera	1
i've using this 2 weeks now i love it ! it very user friendly touch-screen controls . i only wish dvds could last longer than half hour , but size this model i over look	1
we needed easy use , lightweight , quality video camcorder anyone could use . sony dcr-dvd7 great . worked excellent vacation , our beach video images excellent - " easy button " makes whole experience shooting video snap . when we reviewed video quality surprising very good price this camcorder . we jvc camcorder we paid double price which i find difficult/complicated too heavy use . note : dvd7 so easy use - example ; i holding one dog ( 7 month old wiggly puppy)in one arm , using our dvd7 other hand capture our other dog playing tag sand crab , video images turned out steady , focused , clear . digital still images - i not purchase this device still images . if all i wanted still images , i would use disposable camera beach , our sony digial camera other times . now software : easy fun use . ** battery - really last full hour ! i using it video , play-back video , not still pictures . overall impression : i wanted point shoot camcorder great video images . here all you : insert dvd , turn power , touch " easy button " , shoot . if you want lightweight , easy use , excellent video images , battery lasts full hour , dcr-dvd7 exactly all these things .	1
i purchased this bogen ( manfrotto ) swivel/tilt head bogen ( manfrotto ) monopod . i wanted something stabilize my camera without carry tripod . this head great !!! it comes plate attaches camera . then you simply place camera device it snaps shut . it easy pull lever disconnect your camera . prevent you doing this accidentally , it safety lock you deploy flick your thumb . i recommend this other folks wishing stabilize their camera not lug tripod around	1
i canon s3 got this go manfrotto 676b monopod . used it numerous times it works great	1
this came quickly very competitive price . it works well my fuji s5000 camera - noticeably wider view minimum zoom	1

this camera great quality ! photos unbelievable color detail . it great camera price . software fine , but not amazing , but great enhansing , color effects , cropping , fun effects	1
we purchased this photo album christmas gift our 25 year old son who down syndrome . this good purchase he loves watching photos he taken himself his digital camera . we simply showed him how slip his sd card into slot told hiim wait it load . we it set slideshow after unit turned , it loads shows all pics card loops repeat . this unit operates very simply . we not " format " pictures into unit . we no idea what others complaining . we purchase leather case not use frame on/off button , plug electric cord all other switches ports accessible case . leather case substitute frame it stand itself when opened . frame clumsy opened get controls . frame could engineered more logically . we also purchased rechargable battery this good choice well . it makes unit totally portable seems adequate playing time . it never lost power while our son using it . " portability " this unit big draw if we could make only one suggestion it would battery should part package rather than purchase it company separately . we glad we purchased this item our son it brought him much joy ! we listened less complimentary comments others submitted not purchased unit , our son would missed out one his favorite " gadgets " . we rating this 4 stars only because we think battery should included original package replacements should available purchase stores . we also think frame itself should access openings all switches ports .	1
small compact-functions well . good not only road , but also when you want recharge your spare battery without " tying up " your camera .	1
this camcorder best deal if you looking something easy use don't need newest bells whistles . it small light , making it easy hold record . options there zooming , light , snapshots , etc . so far quality great . even if it lasts just few years , this price it still well worth it . would definitely recommend it	1
wonderful camcorder . very easy use really small . enjoyed it christmas my grandchildren	1
i really like this camera . it 10x optical , image stabilization , 3.0 inch lcd 230,000 pixels , more . size great 10x zoom camera . image stabilization great getting shots would come out blurry my canon powershot a620 . my other favorite feature besides zoom image stabilization , wide angle . it great finally get cityscapes whole skyline one shot !! camera set 16x9 , i get 24mm shot ! what i don't like this camera it short battery life . even the1300mah battery i bought , i get less shots than my canon . colors photos this camera lot less colorful than canon . something i get used . i very disappointed find out this camera no zoom movie mode , unlike its predecessor , tz1 . luckily , not stop me buying this camera . overall , this camera great buy , especially if you want i.s. wide angle , long zoom	1
i just received dmc-tz3a . i love this camera . this my first camera ever . i love features , build quality , menu system . i am still getting used learning how take quality pictures . example , i trouble getting it focus times . i am certain this just learning curve me . one feature i am disappointed it lacks - auto retraction lens when playback mode . most other cameras automatically retract lens protect it when viewing pictures camera . this one not this you turn camera off get it retract . i really wish they would update firmware support this important safety feature . all-in-all i definitely recommend this camera	1
matsunichi seems get it right - price , size , resolution . main problem * all * digital frames resolution . while typical print gives you around 200-300 dots per inch , most digital frames offer mediocre values 72 100 . matsunichi offers you quite respectful 125 dots per inch . this means images look absolutely perfect distance two-three feet - even if you 20/20 vision . other positive things i want mention : - it offers excellent view angle - i would estimate it 170 degrees screen bright crisp great ( lcd screen ) color reproduction- it usable remote control- it understands all major memory cards- it plays mp4 movies sound , though manual says they recommend use compact flash card ( i tried sd without any problem ); movies pictures may mixed slideshow- it play unprotected mp3 music background- frame internal software upgradeablefrankly , frame ability play mp4 movies not so easy use - because most digital cameras produce video clips different format . it not play drm protected mp4 movies music ipod either . bottom line here - this just picture frame , not tv or music player . now not so good news . this frame not internal memory - so you need memory card , but not rush buy new 2gb unit . it seems this frame only display first 256 images any memory card , so old 16mb memory card you received your camera two years ago suddenly may become useful . slideshow parameters broken - power frame always resets 10 seconds interval pictures . problem maximum selectable interval 30 seconds - i would prefer it 10 minutes range . because software upgradeable there chance matsunichi fixes these bugs eventually . frame tiny internal speakers produce sound just laughable - not expect anything good this area . other hand there audio/video output cable ( included ) , so you attach external speakers and/or tv ( standard resolution ) - but i not see how it fits product intended usage pattern . all thing considered - this solid 4 stars . i could give it five if not problems mentioned above . matsunichi seems go right direction offering affordable useful product great consumer value .	1
image real sharp bright , however , instructions could clearer . grandkids like seeing themselves pop up brilliant color	1

this got best camera money you buy right now !! i looking affordable camera , small thin , well-known name brand , takes sharp digital photos , shoot low light , uses cheap sd cards , good-sized lcd display , take decent videos . well , this casio exilim everything more , great price . i used it so much during my out-of-state travels without running out power or memory ( i bought 2gb sd card $20 [ ... ] i take more 1000 hi-res photos or hour video ) . i absolutely surprised how good videos i shoot this small digital camera , now i decided not buy new video camcorder , this casio exilim all i would need any occasion . if you're market great camera , look no further than casio exilim	1
this product exceeded my expectations performance , picture quality ease use its excellent . i already recommended this product 4 my friends , its must gadget 8 inch screen it just capitavates you every time you look it . well worth buying	1
i purchased 55mm filter my konica minalta 18-70mm lens . quality filter excellent . my photographs exceptionally sharp , course , filter protects lens . when using lens 18mm , due thickness filter band , small bit vinetting evident . this expected standard filter used strong wide angle focal length . those doing extensive wide angle photography , special thin banded filter better choice . overall , excellent filter great price	1
this one best presents i ever gave my elderly mother . it kept her touch members her family who scattered across three continents bring them her home . she loves it - once you programmed it , it requires no maintenance , not turning off , nothing . it switches itself automatically every day displays anything up 300 photographs sequence or randomly . great present . only one small complaint - device downloads images card onto its own rather limited menory rather unpredictable uncontrollable fashion . i believe more recent models fixed this problem . but don't let this put you off . you give someone great pleasure offering it them	1
i bought this camera back september when it new $200 ... now i see price mere $140 . wow ! point shoot cameras go down value quickly ! i originally wanted get film slr camera but i didn't know much cameras i needed something quick easy pick up learn . time cheapest film slr also $200 . i figured i'd probably spending more film developing long run so i just got this camera instead . it came 2 regular aa batteries , av/usb cable , thin cotton sleeve , carrying strap , instructions , warranty info , cd rom . first it pretty easy use . all i ended up photographing first few days just simple little things around town or around house or whatever using auto mode . first picture i took my dog . few days later i buy some rechargeable batteries because lets face it , regular alkalines not last long high-draining devices . i started taking more more pictures following weeks experimenting different scene settings learning adjusting lighting focusing my camera it job without any problems . it very easy use that what i liked it . it decent size also . i could just put it my bag i'm off wherever . once i filled up 32mbs internal memory i went out picked up largest capacity memory stick best buy which 512mb ms duo around $60 it well worth it . i wanted duo because i like view my photos my psp ! following months i also picked up vad-peb lens adaptor , wide angle telephoto lens also some filters basically maxed out this camera its full potential . overall i'm pretty impressed this camera . it simple use features make it easy anyone pick up take great photos . over months i it i've definetley seen improvements my photography skills i've basically learned all its ' features mastered this camera . before i just pointing shooting here there ... i just got back trip down oregon coast i've taken some breathtaking photos even people dslrs impressed . i've also used it record me riding bmx too . seeing i've learned thing or two taking amazing pictures i am more than happy because i never knew anything photography before i picked up this camera now it my second favorite hobby . see this camera gone down price -- well i can't recommend it enough you beginners . but don't fooled fact it only point shoot . give it some time creative because you eventually learn how take amazing pictures . if you want best out this camera though , sure pick up vad-peb ring , 512mb memory stick , bunch lenses filters you one finest 4.1 mp cameras market sure . eventually i end up picking up nikon dslr camera because this little sony camera only beginning my passion photography . but i not sad when i lay this camera down ! it taught me basics ease i am thankful . reason i give it only 4 stars following reasons below . 1 . if you get vad-peb ring adaptor , your flash blocked . 2 . zooming really far increases chances blurred pics . but it nothing little iso 400 tripod can't fix . 3 . night pictures take awhile process normally come out blurry if you can't hold your camera still . otherwise , back tripod . 4 . focusing only certain subjects takes awhile learn . but like i said , give it time	1
i bought this camera 3 months ago used it few times . last week all sudden pictures look out focus over-exposed . i haven't changed anything or anything . i no idea what wrong camera , but given price i'm pretty annoyed amazon.com not refund my money because it over 30 days	-1
i've camera over year , taken several thousand pictures it . it pretty darn good overall . i've pleased image quality , especially scenery shots . it fall somewhat short portraits people many cases , though . easy use . minor durability problems .	1
i bought this camera my wife christmas after i bought it she talking said she not like hp products . well she opened it christmas said it looked nice . after she took 40 pictures it i could not pry it out her hand crowbar .. it takes great pictures very easy work . she even let me take couple pictures it . so it shows you don't spend lot money get great camera . keep up great work hp ..	1
this camera basically norm disposable cameras , it isn't too hard see why . if you just want cheap camera works well very reliably , this one you . if only this camera could zoom , but asking far , far too much disposable . also , try smacking bottom this camera set off flash without taking picture ; just useless tip	1
great addition gadget bags when smaller version just won't	1
highly recommend . huge difference pictures . i quite amazed cannot live without it anymore	1
love love love this camera . simple , easy use , just point shoot . i handed this off my husband no instructions one day said " take some pictures " ! he turned it , saw button taking pictures , found zoom button off ! he so impressed , i kept telling him fujis really intuitive now he believes me ! takes wonderful pictures , nothing complain . fine low-light , outside , sunny days , cloudy days . i haven't found situation where it doesn't work well . there all sorts manual settings you use if you want , fun dual picture option ( takes two pictures row , one flash , one without flash ) , or just let camera decide you based upon situation . definitely recommended my friends , i just love orange color . sure makes it easier find when you put it down covered end table ! :	1
honest , i am more particular canon sony cameras , but my wife got this herself so i got play it . it very nice lcd screen , decent battery life , easy navigate menus controls . it comfortable hold . pictures it produces don't seem any different then my canon sony cameras computer web images , but i haven't tried any prints yet . i don't think it turns quickly enough , not like my canon sony point shoots . my style " shooting hip " so speak , random , sudden , unpredictable moments . also , usb cable it uses connect computer not standard , it not work same cable my other cameras use(they all work same cable ) , but it comes its own . or just get card reader . fun	1
i bought this my 9 year old daughter she loves it . she use all functions make movies . very easy use takes great pictures . would good begining photographer , great price too	1
dsc-t100 very good camera i would highly recommend it . i several generations cybershot series ( dsc-t1 , dsc-t9 now dsc-t100 ) they've all great , high quality cameras . this camera takes beautiful pictures . pictures clear , little no white bleeding , superb colors great contrast . lens bigger than previous models so it works better low light conditions apparently this camera uses noise reduction technology used new high end sony cameras so pictures should less noisy when it dark too . movie quality 640x480 30 frames per second audio . unlike previous models you zoom while recording movies ( big plus ! ) , whereas previous models you locked whatever zoom level you set before you began recording . also , movies saved into mpg not quicktime so you're not locked into video forma t.t he camera bigger than previous top-end models , but not much . i imagine they made change fit 5x optical zoom ( over previous 3x ) . while they extra depth they threw 3 inch lcd ( instead 2.5 ) larger battery ( drive larger lcd no doubt ) . i personally preferred feel dsc-t9 , but i accept trading features bit more size . downsides camera few minor , if i could i would given this product 4.5 /5 , but they don't let you . but , here problems i this camera . 1 . reduced buttons : previous models they removed buttons replaced them software driven menus . while i not mind software menus , i mind not choice using software menus using physical buttons . they really should included button delete i really want switch pick movie mode picture mode . it takes few extra seconds switch previous models i don't like . companies seem think it makes something easier use if they make it software driven , but really it makes it harder slower use . 2 . options not very accessible : software menus impose too many limitations . i should able cycle through all flash options flash button auto mode , but i go into program auto mode it , i use software menus it . this camera ability set brighter flash or dimmer flash , but it takes so long change i won't ever able use it . same type problem applies red eye reduction ( although , i don't think it necessary because it doesn't seem red eye problems since flash further away lens ) . 3 . camera still missing options dsc-t1 . when i bought my dsc-t9 i remembered so angry they changed removed options , still they're missing . example , you cycle through different display levels ( normal , normal histogram , bright , etc . ) . dsc-t1 there option turn off backlight , which increased battery time dramatically . but , you can't this newer dsc-t9 or even newest dsc-t100 models . 4 . it sony so you pay lot more it . camera reasonable price , but make it useful you need buy memory stick pro duo , which costs considerable amount more than sd cards ( even though they same technology ) . you also may want docking station , which far overpriced , all various other peripherals more expensive then this should also . don't let negatives discourage you though . this good product sony deserves praise making it . i just wish they'd consult me before they marketed it . :	1
this camera pretty incredible . you so much camera itself , before you even upload pictures . it so advanced compared my previous fujifilm digital camera or any other camera i've seen matter . only thing little bit bummer it little slow times due capacity information it processes , but it well worth couple seconds extra wait time . i am extremely happy satisfied my purchase am looking forward seeing what hp comes up next .	1
i love this camera !!! screen huge ! pictures come out great !! there not much you can't this camera , great investment if you love taking all kind pictures indoors , outdoors , light , or dark !! great job hp !!!	1
this pocket sized stainless steel package delivers more than i expected . it easiest digital camera use than any i've owned or used . i get more use this camera simply because it truly pocket sized camera i carry it me most time . huge 3 " lcd display one most outstanding features . its battery strong not let me down yet . camera much quicker use than low resolution camera built into my cel phone . video audio quality very good . this feature packed camera one best values out there	1
very versatile use because its many features . easy use basic point shoot mode . difficult aim accurately outdoors bright light because display washed-out background light	1
i decided get one new stylus cameras my old camera dying new ones water resistant ( supposedly waterproof ten feet ) . i lot canoeing i believe dampness hastened demise my previous camera . camera takes excellent pictures 4 power optic zoom works quite well . i used it indoor outdoor pictures . while it not versatile slr types , it good quick pictures which mostly what i take these days . it fair amount versatility , but it takes bit time adjus t.t he only downside i found camera it not viewfinder , only screen which tends wash out bright light . this not posed serious obstacle any pictures i taken date , but it restrict ability finely compose picture . if this issue could resolved , i would absolutely nothing but good things say this unit	1
this camera really fits niche if you like hike , bike , canoe , raft , kayak , etc . rubberized corners sealed design , it made adventure . i've dropped mine , rained , splashed big time- without problems . also , it most features all other camera . easy use , rugged , good pics- i highly recommend it . i use it often my blog : www.riverrant.blogspot.com . many photos this camera posted .	1
delivery camera very prompt . camera what i expected , i am very pleased it portability , usefulness . sanyo support vpc-c6 camera great sanyo firmware update downloads . thanks	1
i just purchased c6 took it disneyland video kids . bottom line i love this cam . here my thoughts after using it one week : without doubt , size makes this camera so much more usable than larger models " go " shooting . i mini dvd cam fits your palm , but you can't put it your pocket . me , its pain get it out fanny pack or whatever i miss shots . trip like disneyland , it so nice able this thing my pocket able take it out fast discretely shoot all kinds great shots rides , etc . after few hours , i could literally take it out my pocket , flip screen up my thumb shooting 3 seconds ! able go back forth pictures video gave me way more shots i wouldn't get dig out camera . i just hate carry around all gear . far quality , photos turned out pretty good . i expected less based other reviews . i not enlarged anything yet . my only complaint would bit overly saturated colors . i may able fix setting camera . best shots bright sunlight pool . video quality decent , better than i expected low light . it focused pretty well low light . i got some good results indoor rides . my favorite thing hold camera out shoot myself my son ride . size makes this easy course you turn screen around so you see yourself . i it my dvd cam , but it gets heavy bulky . anti-shake not great . you really watch how much you move it around . it works , it just could better . i didn't problem stills even when zooming . like others , i found you get lots camera noise when taking picture during video . wind reduction works much better than my other cam ( panasonic dvd model ) . sound decent overall . flash very weak . 6 ' max i would guess . weaker than my pentax optio digital camera . i not take lot indoor/night shots though . i really like how fast it warms up . when you turn it or flip up screen , it ready go just few seconds . this why i don't like dvd cams , warm up really slow ... like 30 seconds my panasonic vdr . i lose lots shots becuause this . i like buttons all front accessed thumb . it took bit get used its small size . there slide type switch go back forth viewing recording so you it fast without menu . i forgot buy extra battery which mistake . i don't know how much life i got , but i started out each day 8:30 am noon it dead . but i took lots video flash pictures . i really like docking station becuase you don't take battery out charge it you plug into tv watch videos . cool use docking station it doubles table-top tripod . i used it video fireworks show pretty good results . remote worked ok , but one bad feature if you paging through bunch clips tv you stop 10 seconds , it goes back different screen you page all way back through clips get where you . maybe this changed setup , but i don't know . also , there now battery level indicator screen . battery just died . i think you check it menu , but pain . i got two , 2 gig sd cards . sandisk extremes ( or ultras i think ) . it writs them super fast . no issues so far . each card gave me 80 or 90 minutes hights quality . i didn't fill them all up 5 days disneyland . lens cap cheap plastic kind hard get off but i got used it . it working ok , but i bet it crack before long . they should figure out how integrate one slides off . bottom line : if you like me don't like tons gear hanging around your neck or fanny pack or whatever , this camcorder you . i able get more cool shots becuase its speed size than using my dvd model . i don't put so much weight quality , becuase family vacations its way more important get once lifetime shot my kids doing something cute than image quality perfect . now i just need learn how use imovie put all these clips together	1
this camera great value , i bought it two lens package . normal lens good zoom lens huge . i bought 133x speed 4gb flash card pictures i've taken some amazing shots . sports mode great skiing captures very fast movement . focusing little more elaborate so takes bit getting used if you're coming compact digital camera . highly recommende	1
i this camera 4 months now its outstanding pro-sumer grade digital slr . amazon price this camera body two lens kit simply best price found anywhere , less than most vendors charge this camera single lens . no longer i mourn loss my nikon 8008s 35mm film camera . both lenes outstanding optics metering system superb . included lens hoods very helpful , but make sure you take them off flash photography . lenses operate quietly quickly . they nice grip . built-in pop up flash adequate close-up snap shots , but you'll want one two available dedicated flash units fl-36 or fl-50 . don't waste your time or money fl-20 . i bought fl-36 , which full featured dedicated flash significant manual overrides just camera meet your creative needs . i'm likely further upgrade fl-50 which more powerful full professional grade flash . serious photographers , this camera gives you total manual control provides overrides every possible setting ensure you realize your full creative needs ( just any professional 35mm or digital slr ) . automatic settings focus exposure outstanding well . there several program modes various types shooting user program mode where you essentially make your specific manual settings automatic set-up . controls well placed , except one-touch white balance auto-focus frame buttons right where you may normally want place your right thumb while holding camera , especially if you're taking vertical shots . large lcd display excellent easy read even bright light , but advised its not composing lining up your pictures . display making your camera settings viewing pictures you've taken . you must compose your shots through viewfinder only . viewfinder gives you gives you plenty camera setting information immediate exposure composition feedback so you make adjustments without removing your eye viewfinder . camera shoots every file format complete amatuers want serious professional photographers need ranging various degrees quality jpeg all way up tiff several raw settings . shutter speeds go manual settings up 1/4000th iso range up 1600 . camera built solid , very well balanced lightweight . it looks great feels great nice grip . included olympus lbh-1 battery extraordinary life . i camera first 3 months without change or charge . time i took over 600 pictures , often found i left camera when i went pull it out my bag next shoot . fact , during my trip ireland during this mentioned timeframe . i basically left camera night day entire week juice spare when i got home . phenominal ! mentioned included lenses this kit ( wide angel normal normal long telephoto ) very , very good . i'm so pleased overall performance capabilities camera itself , i'm definitely going invest heavily professional level lens upgrades . exception macro extreme wide angle , those lenses essentially same focal lengths included this camera kit . however upgrades " faster " lenses allowing more very low light levels greater ability capture sports activity . bottomline , this camera fantastic everything far more expensive professional cameras . olympus full range accessories serious professional photographers amatuers work their way up . this camera it all price no one seems able beat	1
pretty comfortable . could more practical couple inner pockets	1
pros : good those who want automatic camera those who want adjustable settings . cons : software awkward . it can't used webcam . bottom line : great camera lot features used beginners enthusiasts . why you buy this product ? my husband i got fuji finepix f31fd digital camera our christmas gift december 2006 . we wanted something replace our current digital camera which quickly becoming more more irritating because it not take good pictures low light it not zoom feature . describe your experience using this produc t.t he fuji finepix f31fd digital camera arrived when my husband work i home vacation . i so excited immediately started playing it . one first tests i fuji finepix f31fd digital camera check how well it worked low light . i closed all blinds , turned off all lights , took picture items approximately 18 feet away . i took this picture night room pitch black . i amazed . picture came out clear it looked if it taken afternoon . you could not tell looking picture it taking completely dark room . second feature i wanted test face detection feature . so i took pictures me this feature turned off it turned . i pleasantly surprised results . while pictures not hugely different , it clear feature worked i more focus picture taken feature . this feature even worked when i took pictures dolls when i took picture picture several faces it . one feature i didn't think would all useful video capture feature . i love taking pictures but never into recording video . however since this feature included i find myself using it more more . it quick easy switch over video capture component record those precious moment . it limited approximately 15 minutes video which isn't great deal time . there supposed new memory card coming out soon allow users record longer periods video ( approximately 30 minutes ) . my husband keeps looking new memory card released but i'm fine approximately 15 minutes video approximately 350 pictures . what you love this product ? it compact easy handle . it lot great features including taking pictures dark , face recognition , video capture , ability let camera automate setting or let user manually adjust them , 2 sec 10 second timer , excellent zoom feature . i also like it warns you when you need make adjustments get best picture . example if i am zoomed closely auto focus work , it warm me . what you hate ? i not like software comes camera because 1 ) i think way it labels items awkward , 2)it seems all or nothing i.e. save all pictures or erase all pictures 3 ) it doesn't let you view before saving items , 4 ) it kind slow . maybe i just haven't learned use it correctly but doesn't work well me . i also not like i not use this webcam . i connect it my tv tuner view what happening my room but yahoo messenger not recognize it webcam . recommended : yes	1
tis best digital camera i owned or used . picture quality outstanding speed super fast . it so many options capabilities make it such great camera . face detection little slow i'm not sure if it makes much difference but i no complaints all . camera little pricey but i'm sure it give me years trouble free use . i also got 1gb type " " ( high speed ) card go it this combo fantastic	1
title this listing says its a80 g6 , but its only a80 . g6 uses ladc58d adapter	1
our kodak camera takes aa ( disposable ) batteries - this battery best so far we've used . highly recommended affordable	1
image stabilizer technology ( ) really works . around long time video camera but you could never see it work real time . you either turn it or off . these bino you just push button top , all shake stops . this not gimmick or sales hipe . i would not believed it unless i saw it myself . i used steiner 7x50s military other high quality optics , these little 10x30s beat all others my home use . pro's: ( ) really works . affordable . light weight . enclosed soft case fine . great value money . current rebate canon . con's: not water-proof . i would not want backpack these . overall : must buy !! fair weather sports , racing , birding , general home use . read reviews .	1
these binoculars not gadget but real advance . i am engineer first skeptical internal control system binoculars could really deliver enhancement seeing . however , i amazed their resolution first try . i view astronomical objects well animals . my first trial reading number tag high voltage line 500 yds away . unstabilized i could see yellow sign containing number but could not resolve it my eye ; soon i pressed stabilizer button sign easily readable ! second example , i noticed buck deer dozing fence 300 yds away but motion binoculars unstabilized not allow me count his points . press button , seven one side 6 other ! so even though resolution binoculars not change theoretically , mechanism , increases your hand held seeing resolution what i would say would factor 5 . this addition fact image not jiggle but remains locked view . works correspondingly well viewing star clusters , nebulae moon . no motion stars hand held	1
i've this device since 5/2006 relatively pleased results . video low light conditions not great , but outdoors video indoor/outdoor photos fine . though i hd television , i tend not view my videos it . i transfer video files my macbook pro view them quicktime player . i think video quality great just fact i instant access videos huge plus ! small size also great ... i just came back ski trip actually skiing filming same time ! you wouldn't big sony hd camera ! sanyo also told me sdhc ( high capacity ) cards also work this camera , so i intend buy 4g card very soon . amazon also sells some lens attachments sanyo come out i may look	1
after reading alot reviews here other places , everyone gave it ho-hum rating . i disagree , other things you take these grain salt . i just purchased mine 3 weeks ago i've already taken it two nascar races more importantly , las vegas weekend . it really proved itself vegas . i walked up down strip multiple times ( made few stops way ) this camera my pocket whole time . it never felt heavy or uncomfortable walking , standing or sitting . plus i could just take it out within few seconds take picture or movie many sights there . unless you're some sort videophile , this camera great . once you make few important settings , its rock solid . remember , its hd video 5mp camera ... it looks it . my requirements good video camera good still camera all one because i don't want carry 2 cameras i wanted something small sleek fit my pocket i don't want walk miles up down strip camera bag . this perfect ! price bit steep comparable sized units ( also sanyo ) , but i don't plan buying while thought hd would worth it . i opted 2gb card off bat it pretty inexpensive would hold plenty video ... it . i've found rarely anyone shoot anything hour straight ; it usually 1 min here , 4 min there , etc . only thing it doesn't night shooting , but ya can't everyhthing it takes fine pictures even little light . anyway , great camera	1
nikon d200 amazing camera . this review amazon packing procedures . this review alert prospective buyers amazon not pack these cameras well . i just purchased one it came packed like book , very little padding . i called nikon their recommendation return item pronto . i returned camera ( much trepidation)and purchase trusted source . just wanted give you all heads up	1
okay , let get few things out way : 1 . this case no belt loop . none . zip . nada . so it good protecting your camera while carried around pocket or purse , but you won't hanging this thing off your belt like batman . 2 . picture doesn't show it , but there hole top center " lid " case let wrist strap pass through . 3 . case white stitching . very classy , imho . 4 . round " bump " flap secures top lid case not snap closure , it magnet . intention here good it makes lid easy open without tug excessively case , but it double-edged sword because case also opened if it carried purse or bag any other object rub up against front case push magnetic flap up . so make sure this case sits solo , i guess . 5 . although case made genuine leather , it sure doesn't smell like it ; it smells like it buried ground black pepper month . pretty disappointing . all all , fujifilm sc-fxz1b leather camera case elegant well-crafted item ties z1 target user : fashion-minded occasional snapshooter carries ultra-compact camera more statement than necessity	1
this very flexible capable camera . if you looking more than point shoot offer , there very few would compare . me deciding factor high quality lieca lens wide angle , if you havent compared this directly conventianal lens you amazed what youve missing . 16:9 ok feature if you plan hdtv veiwing but screen size compromised when you switch 4:3 . i would prefer larger screen lose 16:9 feature . lens cap little annoying well but those issues aside , i am very satisfied	1
meets all expectations . questions noise greatly overblown . image stabilation reduces impact noise low light . people really expect get great image very low light condition ? regardless noise contrast too low get quality image except very special circumstances . up until last few years iso 400 film similar problems iso 800 virtually useless except get image . when i got this camera i took numerous pictures night inside got very good quality pictures without flash . far better than my old ditigal better than my film camera . lcd size image quality really impressive . best i seen	1
this camcorder awesome !! easy use instruction manual breaks things down you barney style :) battery only lets you record continuously 2 half hours ( more than i need ) so you may want standby battery waiting if it nessasary	1
if you want lens stays 24/7 while you chase your kids around ( carry their stuff altogether ) try take decent pictures , well this it . good every occasion , wedding landscape . every once while i look up new lenses wondering if it time get new one , but 18-200mm , one not make sense unless you time change lenses carry them . i am not pro , this lens my d70s i am way too happy . sometimes when i am out shooting pictures i hardly time change camera settings , i cannot imagine changing lens too . my other lenses cabinet . if you professional you may get 4 lenses better performances , i am sure . but i read reviews pros like this pricey toy too .	1
undoubtedly great achievement nikon offer this 18/200 range , very convenient carry . lower f/stop alternative would made this lens even more successful .	1
this works fine me - easy use light carry . if you filming mma or muay thai half cage , extend legs straight down , spike-style , otherwise some heavyweights clinch up topple onto your new tripod before you move bust one struts .	1
if you want catch something binoculars quickly without fooling around trying focus ... this it . we live lake we always something wild catch our eye . this very beneficial focus there all times . they bit bulky somewhat heavy but excellent pair binoculars . " shake " power not bad like we thought it would . i not say enough bushnell company . they support back their products like i never seen any other company . i always buy this brand now because this .	1
i purchased these because i don't like taking my $100 binoculars football games rock concerts . these perfect . optics little cheap , but $20 , i think it steal	1
bushnell powerview 12x25 fine , small pocket-sized binocular . since my wife avid bird watcher , we already several binoculars various sizes viewing power . our grandson accidentally broke her small 10x25 bushnell we used trips , so i researched , then bought this one amazon her birthday . she loves it . viewing power bit greater than other every bit compact , which makes it easy pack vacations , yet provides good viewing experience when enjoying various bird populations around country . we both highly recommend this , other bushnell products	1
small compact . let me see everyting i wanted	1
my sister considering telescope but unsure whether she should put out large amount money something she might not often use . i suggested orion starblast astro telescope way test waters first . telescope very inexpensive , yet reviews scope good . what i didn't expect how good this little telescope . saturn rings clear , hint cassini still nights . jupiter two primary bands clear well , globular clusters much brighter more resolved than you would believe possible scope this price ( don't expect glittering jewelry boxes though . ) scope well built , solid , yet lightweight . its incredibly easy use , view primary sweet spot bright clear . outside sweet spot images get distorted quickly , but this price small consideration . like rest scope , red dot finder easy use . my sister scope not jerkyness other reviewers reported , but i can't say whether we lucky or they weren't . i informal test whether first telescope any good : new owners put it closet after few frustrating attempts , or they developed growing fondness knowledge astronomy ? our case little starblast excelled this test . one prior reviewer asked why , telescope this good this price , everyone didn't telescope ? good question -- first scope , its well worth price . if you planning buy or give first scope , i wouldn't look any further . you still happily using this scope long after you move up larger , more powerful telescopes	1
i've orion starblast over year now , even though i larger , more sophisticated telescopes , it one i use most . setup instantaneous though , like other reflectors , it takes some time cool down cold nights . it easily portable , works well grab `n go . short focal length makes it excellent low power , wide field views deep sky objects moon . through starblast , i observed ( name few ) ring nebula , andromeda galaxy ( its two neighboring galaxies ) , galaxies m81 m82 , countless open clusters , lagoon trifid nebulas , eagle nebula , nebula orion , comets neat linear . jupiter belts moons apparent higher power , staurn rings phases venus mercury . during last opposition , i could see martian polar ice caps . during last lunar eclipse , i no trouble taking digital photographs through this instrument . this same fast optics formula edmund astroscan bushnell voyager bowling ball . starblast far away best three , but others , high power views soft . feature not problem those us primarily interested deep sky . planetary views could more detailed , my own starblast won't split double double suburban skies . ( orion somewhat longer 4.5 " 8 dobsonian more suited these subjects . ) addition , most globular clusters present unresolved fuzzy balls , they any instrument this aperture . price , though , you can't really beat starblast . it works well family telescope , or casual scope someone interested but not obsessed astronomy . it small , inexpensive , intuitive enough handled children . it also works nicely crusty old guys like me who bigger hardware , but just don't feel like moving it every night .	1

i bought this camera back-up my d2x so i wouldn't change lenses much trip i'm taking alaska this summer . well let me tell you , d200 18-200mm vr lens incredible . it fast , quiet pleasure use . i've read forums 18-200 little soft . so far i totally disagree , pictures i've taken very sharp . i wish this would available when i bought my d2x . if it , i would own two d200 instead one each . highly recommended !!	1
i recently recieved my new camera , i am thrilled . i researching which camera buy since december ( when our last camera went capoot ) . there mixed reviews olympus sw series , but could not resist appeal this camera unique features . i cannot wait take it into pool this summer kids . so far , point shoot options pictures lovely . any person screw up pictures any camera , but this camera so many features avoid . my husband i wonderful time taking extreme close up shots our garden . i not seen quality , much satisfaction camera since we first switched over digital . i am very pleased , say least , this purchase .	1
we bought one these items see how well it would work pictures kids grandma grandpa . it easy use , holds lot pics , nice picture quality , convenient size . we liked it so much we bought 2 more - 1 uncle living state 1 my wife keep her purse . well worth money not traditional pictures getting ruined your wallet	1
i read all reviews considered other possibilities , but this far least expensive most needed features it intended use . viewer works others mentioned taking limitations ( no indexing ) into account still very worthwhile tool . what i could fiond out imnag es ordered software according date picture taken . i haven't delved into manner which one could change dates enable arranging images group subject matter , or what ever groupings one would want . my use take images trip visit relatives show them others back here home . it works very well this prupose . compare prices , say , ipod or such .	1
versatile tripod low price , light weight , sleek design , compact retracted mode , allows great stills almost any position	1

i wanted good quality consumer grade digital camera take short trips , so i purchased this one . i think quality picures very good it most features i wanted . it few dollars more than i really wanted spend , but all all i am pleased . my main complaint battery life little short side , it takes while see photo you just took lcd screen . i really want something hold me two years , then these things twice good fraction cost . now it what i need it pretty well	1
i used nikkon d70 before i bought this one . advantage this camera i dont change lens again again . it includes both wide angle telephoto lens . addition still image , this camera also video feature . so i capture video too . i bought this camera before my niagara vacation . so , i took lots wonderful picture niagara i also video . so , this works me much better	1
i just bought this camera , i think it really great . lcds lens what sold me , they're everything i hoped . very high quality camera . feels solid , all components well made . pictures amazing ( see my posted pics ) . i don't think you need pro use this camera , but features all there those wanting manual control	1
initial impressions new super-zoom olympus camera excellent . thought i'd like view finder , opposed just screen back camera , but digital image view finder isn't crisp i'd like . relatively small fault . still learning use all features	1
i got camera week ago highly recommend it . if you buy this camera , i recommend getting type card which much faster than type taking pictures . some movie functions not work full capability type but faster type . i also recommend getting nimh 2700 mah batteries charger . their higher capacity worth money save over long run . far camera goes , i wish camera higher than 7.1 mp , but compared my old 3.3 mp camera , pictures so much clearer finer . camera many functions build , you need read manual get full use camera . out box auto mode works well , but after reading manual , i think most higher end users want set their own modes . some nice included functions manual ability , ability choose among 15 different shooting types ( such through window ) , ability store raw images among others . storing raw images slow due large file size take several seconds type card . movie mode able take 30 fps 640x480 , but 15 fps still good quality . type card you only take 15 seconds movies full mode , but type you fill your memory card . default setting movies without sound so you need turn this . however , sound turned , i not able zoom , even card . image stablization nicely setup set just push button rather than going through menu . also , eyepiece viewfinder setup so if display back , viewfinder off vice-versa . fact when you use eyepiece viewfinder , picture normally displayed back now eyepiece . i suppose this good taking pictures when it too bright see back screen . finally , i like take weather shots this camera includes time lapse mode , which i put together my old software ( not olympus ) into movie . [ ... ]	1
i camera 5 months now . i great time learning use it . easy use takes good pictures . only negative nighttime fireworks setting not greatest , but still pretty deciet	1
this supposedly entry level digital camera , but i already found more cool bells whistles than i ever use . since most my photography performance horses , i very interested how camera would handle motion pictures . " sports " mode stops them their tracks totally terrific resolution . it very easy operate screen menus really effortless use . only thing i am diappointed strap carrying . it so flimsy useless .	1
hp camera very easy use takes great pictures , its small enough carry comfortable but not feel fragil	1
great picture quality very easy use . auto picture one best i seen . only con display not bright enough see under sunlight	1
this my first digital camera after using slr ( film ) camera last 15 years . i'm very happy z710 , quality photos , ease use selection features . other reviewers said it well i could . i tried few test photos , zooms , sports , etc . photos came out clear distinct , even under conditions swift movement . important point me ability use rechargeable batteries , which z710 . so there no dependency expensive throwaway batteries . i would prefered digital slr camera , but think i satisified z710 until day finally comes . one thing i miss ability experiment different filters . that worst thing i say camera . but few things i didn't like which nothing photo quality : 1 ) accompanying software ( once installed ) started each time system boots . i would prefer start it myself when i need it , but this option doesn't seem available . 2 ) video sequences filmed quicktime ( . mov ) format . i would preferred more accessible format ( avi ) which i could burn directly onto video cds . i still test more , but video sequences seemed not smooth they might , especially after converting them avis . i realized this might general artifact videos produced via digital cameras . general , it great value money , i would recommend it anyone market digital camera	1
i've using it couple days , i love it . harddisk gift , once you get used it , you'll never believe you've using tape before . usb 2.0 transfer your computer works like charm it pretty quick even very large files , also because video file types mpeg , dvd authoring software doesn't take forever compile dvd , it very quickly . there couple simple , yet powerful editing using camcorder itself . interface pretty intuitive , touch screen very usable even my thick thumbs . video picture quality excellent medium light , ok low light ' far better than my previous canon zr70 though ' . stand still camera simply top notch , compared my current sony p8 . i love slow motion feature , unfortunately it only capture couple seconds , also taking photos while you're video taping great , but you only take couple photos during shooting videos . all all , i'm very happy all it features , also surround sound works pretty well . i didn't give it 5 stars because camera doesn't come usb port , or video output options camera itself , i dock it docking station then connect it my pc , which leaves me choice either put docking station beside my pc move files , or beside my hd tv watch movies camera , not sure why sony least didn't put usb port camera directly , pretty annoying ! also , there no way capture video using this camera , although kind standard feature any cheap mini dv cameras , now i think getting video capture card my computer if i need copy any my recorder programs my dvrs or previous tapes dvd !	1
i went into local camera store look nikon 12-24mm wide angle zoom eventually augment nikon 50mm 1.8 18-200mm vr i currently use my d200 . after seeing sigma 10-20mm , taking test shots it nikon , then printing shots store , i walked out sigma lens . i planned buy 12-24mm nikon next spring when my budget would allow expenditure . i success nikon optics past - starting my first nikon fm back seventies . sigma good construction , nice finish , smooth+fast+quiet focusing 10mm focal length convinced me try my first non-nikon lens 30 years . big factor : sigma lens less than half price nikon lens here canada . it fit my budget , so i took plunge . sigma fits into my " sharp enough " category . real world shooting , its sharpness par my 18-200mm nikon . both lens less sharp than my $100 50mm 1.8 when " test " images blown up 16 " x20 " size . i never notice any lack sharpness " real " pictures . i care more color saturation , contrast color balance anyway . this area , sigma well . saturation contrast equal both my other nikon lens - particularly f8 smaller aperatures . wide open , i find some weakening contrast . sigma warmer color termperature than my other lens . one click toward blue photoshop would fix this minor variance color . but i use my 10-20mm almost exclusively landscapes . warmer color generally good thing . i noticed some vignetting @ 10mm f4 . zooming 12mm or stopping down 5.6 elminates any artifacts pictures i taken thus far . i found it more important avoid " thick framed " filters - stacking filters no no this lens . they cause more darkening than wide open f-stop . btw : i added 72 77mm step-up ring my 18-200m vr nikon allow me share filters my zoom lens . i miss manual/autofocus switch sigma lens . i accidently nudged manual focus ring couple times . said , incredible depth field this lens ( or any lens this focal length ) means small focusing errors tolerated :) i recommend this lens - even people like me , who never non-nikon lens before .	1
i got my mb-d200 last fall after more than 6 months using it i should say nikon created winner yet again !!! good : 1 . ability 2 fully charged batteries while going out field gives you extra peace mind . 2 . addition nikon added menu give shooter very good indication battery power remaining . i able get more than 200 shots day starting out 2 fully charged batteries mb-d200 . 3 . weight increase very minimal fact meager increase weight enables shooter balance camera better . 4 . it very thoughtful nikon add shutter release buttons taking portrait shots main sub command dials , mb-d200 . i find myself using these controls quite frequently . if user revert controls camera it would quite frustrating imho . 5 . if you nature/landscape/wildlife photographer , you carry additional aa batteries you field rest assured you won't miss out " kodak moment " due drained battery . some suggestions improvement : 1 . first thing i noticed latch battery compartment . it feels quite flimsy i wish nikon better job this . latch lines one found camera release door compact flash card would solid imho . 2 . though i mentioned you use aa batteries ( you need 6 them ) , they drain out amazingly fast , depending type lens ( or without vr ) , depending whether you using in-built or external flash other variables . so you need quite few aa batteries if you ever rely them field . overcome this problem i am thinking purchasing 2 more en-el3e batteries i found they impressive battery life once fully charged . hope this review useful you ! thanks reading	1
ever since my first purchase my mb-d100 battery pack ( my nikon d100 dslr ) i made it point get one every new dslr i purchased . i believe i even got one my nikon n65 film slr way back when . i currently d100 , d80 d200 they all equipped corresponding battery pack . let face it , d200 battery hog ! maybe 650-700 shots per battery less if you auto preview or preview each shot . mind , dual battery compartment makes this battery hog shoot forever ! when i shoot weddings , i work all day take nothing short 10gb photos there still juice it when we leave ... impressive . i change my batteries half way through day out " principality " more reliability but if you pinch , you just throw 6 aa batteries backup holster slide into compartment . we all know aas bought almost everywhere so you always shoot ! most crucial part this battery pack side shutter release button . no longer you uncomfortably twist turn your right hand strenuous angles if you want compose vertical shot . when you turn your camera sideways , extra shutter release button right there where you used . when paired shutter aperture command dials you ready go quickly efficiently . comfort factor huge this grip . grip fits into your hand like glove very sturdy stable when mounted camera itself . i swear i could hold my camera one well placed finger battery grip ! i notice my wife co-photographer bit trouble couping sheer weight this camera + battery pack but after dealing it shooting , she quickly adjusted now fell love packs well . other features grip nice but not essential such af lock such ... well nikon	1
d-200 great camera but unlike d-100 single battery used camera doesn't last very long charges . multi-power battery pack correct problem-two batteries instead one it also give camera better feel when handling . i love it .	1
nice scope , feels hefty appears well made . glass optics good light gathering abilities . large objective lense nice metal screw lense protector . only drawback i found battery compartment tiny kind hard screw battery cap	1
great product panasonic . this my first digital camcorder i am very pleased quality . used it research fiddler crabs , needed zoom picture quality it excellent . picture crystal clear i took shots 7-8 feet away zoomed max . it also picks up sound even whisper great feature needed . easy use easy transfer video tv viewing	1
well , i it . i finally bought digital camera . don't tell anyone , but i didn't buy it here . canon s1is gone lot places me , always exactly what i want it , flawlessly . it gone ocean , bowling alley , numerous hikes , burning man , mountains , work .. performed like pro . me , controls laid out very logically , it easy me turn off flash when i want take night shot . after few days manual , using camera regularly , menu options became familiar . those us who like self portraiture , lcd screen swivels turns around all way perfect , you set up your self portrait easily . i love black white sepia modes too . taking video this canon , even night , easy . only hitch i seen you cannot zoom very close , otherwise camera cannot possibly keep up keeping video focus ... this easily solved my tripod . sum up : i am so glad i bought this camera my first digital . it perfect me , we very happy together . now i am eyeing smaller canon i slip my pocket . but sssshhhhh , don't tell my s1is	1
i bought this camera last year i'm very satisfied whit it , it incredible resolution good color , saturation quality pictures , you must atention low light condition but rest its great camera very sofisticated when i more money i buy s2	1
i love this rangefinder- much better than type shoots prism flag sticks . you use this one find yardage bunkers , creeks , etc . very accurate very useful . well worth money	1
i got nikon laser rangefinder chrisymas it 8x magnification . i found this powerful golf . i could not hold it steady flag . 6x magnification bushnell yardage pro scout much better . also it very compact stores easily my golf cart . price amazon well below i could find anywhere else .	1
i used this snorkeling grand cayman it fantastic ! easy use , make sure you read instructions seal gasket properly . don't afraid handle it , just put little sealant your forefinger thumb coat it well . getting gasket easy , taking it out ... well ... honest , not . look little area stick something in-between plastic housing ring pop it out ( it not easy , maybe plastic tooth pick ? ) . not use anything damage ring or housing !, if you , very careful . don't forget diffuser ! it works great flash . also , keep diffuser hold it your hand if you must but use it take better portraits , flash simply much this make your portraits much better ( look skin tones after using it ) i wish this camera way clip this diffuser it without case . i didn't buy weights but wish i . camera floats easily , i would get it next time . also , learn buttons well before you go , really get them your memory , its not easy remember them when you're underwater moving around .	1
i loved this - it perfect me . i'm not diver , so i don't know how it would hold up greater depth , but i took it snorkeling ( looks spelled wrong , but i'm not sure , but oh well ) got incredible pictures videos . it also allowed me take it kayaking without paranoid , so it great me .	1
this case nice , but i think expanding sides unnecessary . camera easily slide out out unzipping sides , except elastic strap usually pop up flash when you put camera , then same strap won't let go flash when you pull it out ... unless you unzip all zippers pull it apart . this still best case this camera though , long you don't want carry extra batteries , sd cards , etc .	1
ideal case panasonic ps-slx2 . easy open / close , sturdy nice design . highly recommended	1
money i spent this charger money well spent , i replace my original after my dog decided she needed new chew toy .	1
this camera great ! not only it take great digital photos extremely user friendly , but if you add 1gb memory card it ( which slides right only costs $40.00 ) you take lot great quality digital videos sound very easy upload your computer and/or internet email family etc . fact , there no need buy video camera when you this it fits right your pocket . i take up 30 minute videos lots photos one time . you easily take photo while you making video well	1
i used camera three months , absolutely love it ! pictures crisp ( even very close-ups ) , video feature right up there . sound pick-up excellent . i created two dvd combining videos still pictures . folks thought quality very good . battery life rated very good , i found this true . i carry camera me nearly everywhere i go . people impressed size . drawbacks ? because its size , there no connections camera computer , tv or battery charger . docking station small lightweight . because battery life , i never away home long enough need recharging . i recommend camera without reservations , look first casio future	1
i many traditional film slrs including original pentax k1000 ( fully manual ) , canon rebel xos canon elph . when considering digital slr cameras canon digital rebel point-and-shoot canon digital elph top my list . but $150 less than canon digital elph , casio exilim ex-s series better buy same features ( some cases better execution same features ) . if you're looking fun point-and-click camera record audio , avi movie files digital pictures this it . it takes 15 miuntes read manual you're off taking pictures . pay attention when reading manual everything else seem very intuitive . all cameras i i use this one most often . other users complained proprietary lithium ion battery but 3rd party equivalents available right here amazon site , you just look . my back-up battery only [ ... ] bucks . san disk 1gb memory cards cheap too , [ ... ] online , [ ... ] retail . last , i agree many users lock switch needs developed so you keep camera accidentally turning when it your pocket -- but remember many cameras this problem/lack/this feature . i solved my own issues buying [ ... ] case belt loop	1
this ac adapter sure saves batteries . although it not device use wilds it sure handy use your home photography work shop . it could setup permanent location handy you where it could stored(wound hung)on wall hook , easily accessible whenever need arises . i use mine fairly frequently	1
camera fits perfectly space front pouch extra battery memory card	1
1 . easily accessible menus change camera settings . less used settings deeper menus . one touch flash control nice . 2 . lcd good size framing shots reviewing . 3 . accessing downloading images not require use included cd software . just plug into usb slot [ either win2k or xp ] pc enumerates camera drive . this good those us who other imaging editing software don't want install basic nikon package . 4 . must taken over hundred shots charged pair nimh batteries . 5 . image pixel resolution programmable . 3mp very clear viewing printing . 6 . works fine 1gb sd card ; max spec'ed user guide . 7 . others mentioned , fact lens extends anytime camera turned problem . i originally bought soft case it found lens extended one time when i went take it out . error message screen . power button must gotten pressed . got hard case after . over all good size , feature set , battery life .	1
i just received sd750 my birthday ( thanks mom dad ! ) . i've it several days taken over 3 hundred pictures tons video . it now replaces my old canon s400 , which replacement my antique canon s110 . i've remained true canon because i see amount work they put into making each new generation cameras " much better . " first , colors so much crisper sd750 than prior models , although some tweeking may needed , you always find setting capture color you after . second , video quality outstanding ( highest setting , ) , canon finally took off 3 minute cap video recording allow longer videos . also , highest setting only , you zoom out while recording video . i love 3 inch display incorporates shifting orientation so picture always upright . i wish camera came more powerful optical zoom ... but i imagine i'll get next generation . end , i emphasize , this camera takes oustanding pictures . that what camera should , after all . now quick rundown improvements previous models ( you canon loyalists ): - much improved color- faster picture taking faster everything- extended video capacity ( however much memory ya got)- large lcd appease instant gratification generation- overall improved picture quality ( clarity , color saturation)a few small camera quirks outside picture quality ... jog dial back ( trying emulate ipod ) not smartest addition " play " button little hard hit times . overall , i definitely without hesitation recommend this camera	1
i purchased this product after doing quite bit research . i am big fan canon cameras but recently there some other really good competitors . i bought this one take me everywhere . it almost perfect . size just right . it fits nicely into my pocket or easily into my wife purse . face recognition great feature seems work very well . start-up time time take picture extremely fast accurate . it would nice more powerful optical zoom , little lip one side make holding while taking picture easier . this well built high quality camera i would purchase again second	1
good telescope . i would suggest buying extra lenses ( only two others available this model ) . very light easy travel	1
excellent . upgraded yardage pro 400 . this one so small . much more convenient than 400 . this one just clips your bag . works better well . even picks up those flags just hanging there overcast , windless day . scan feature nice verify you zoning proper target	1
firstly , i love its black all-metal body . i also love its ergonomics size . i've own other digital p/s slrs . they all good cameras , but big size . i tend bring l60 me everywhere i go ( e.g. biking , hiking , etc . ) convenience . inside , it also beautiful . i've ordered prints upto 11x14 they turned out beautiful . using 2gb sd card , it also allowed me record more than 1.5 hours 640x480 video mpeg4 30 fps . if you need small , robust camera you take everywhere you go still takes beautiful pictures , this it	1
i gave this xmas gift my 14-yr-old daughter she loves it . super easy use . good idea get backup battery if you're like her forget charge it sometimes . big selling bonus it thin enough fit into her pocket	1
i purchased second sony vct870rm tripod use separate video cameras because ease setup stability operation . quality construction supports lot good use . eldon wolf - albany ,	1
i got this frame gift my parents after returning different one . quality good it easy use . only thing i would improve there no usb input so you need card reader . overall i would recommend it friends	1
it great product , very easy operate , great size , accepts all my flash card formats . but resolution could better plastic back ( ok , no one look back picture frame ) looks cheap . compared other products i know , i still think it great one	1
if nothing else you get neutral protection you get polarized may or may not work well , but only $17 . i thought it worth it	1
it holds my camera nicely so lcd not get scratched my pocket . camera easy access stays tightly clipped your belt even when hiking . my wife thinks i'm dork wearing camera but we lot great photos camera always me .	1
this not only ideal scope beginners but enough instrument show you new things sky years come . it sturdy simple operate . it enough light-gathering power ( more important than magnification ) reveal dim star clusters , nebulae , galaxies good enough optics show you surface planets like jupiter , saturn , mars . affordable this scope , there no reason give so much glance numerous trashy 60mm refractors exaggerated magnification claims litter market . some advice selection . dobsonians like this one come range sizes . 114mm ( 4 � " ) bit small side but still fine instrument , especially if your ability carry large objects limited . 150-200mm ( 6-8 " ) scope like this one middle recommended range . 250mm ( 10 " ) big side , you should buy one only if you able-bodied . some advice use . viewing through telescope less like playing cd more like playing guitar . finding objects takes little bit practice . simplify finding , i would suggest replacing supplied finder orion superior 8x40 model also supplementing it " red dot " finder ; both available amazon . you also need buy atlas ( sky telescope pocket sky atlas best available ) , red flashlight view charts without blowing out your badly-needed night vision , guidebook lead you interesting objects . these investments greatly add your enjoyment . what more i say ? this kind scope experienced observers trying steer novices towards decades . although , i recommend you your homework before buying any scope -- learn sky get know experienced stargazers who advise you -- when it comes time purchase , you could hardly better than this scope . more advice , see my encyclopedic guide here amazon , " so you want buy telescope .	1
found lens very useful , actually find only minor faults , which not even worth mentioning . considering purchasing wide angle lens supplement my picture taking . would recommend purchasing both	1
i received lens timely manner am very pleased it . thanks provider	1
our camcoder not holding charge . online search found what we needed amazon . placed order received quickly . exact fit our camcorder . camcorder working fine now . thanks	1
i bought this camera after owning olympus digital camera years . i extremely happy my olympus , but wanted something smaller would fit my purse or diaper bag since i'm expecting . this camera such disappointment . just every single picture i took huge white blobs all over it . ( this only happened when using flash . i must admit camera takes great pictures broad daylight without flash . ) plus , if you used zoom all , pictures came out fuzzy . first digital camera i ever owned ( 7 years ago ) took better pictures ! store i bought camera wouldn't take it back because i waited two days past 14-day return policy . so , i sold camera took $100 loss . i'd much rather lose $[ ... ] than keep this camera	-1
this why sony hot ! this sexy little ( yes its really small size pack cards ) it takes perfect clear crisp pictures battery life long 320mins perfect vacation , make sure get memory stick it though , because w/o it it only holds 15 pics . this my first digital camera i would definitely buy sony again	1
i am just average guy when it comes using camera . probably below average . i started trying use 100% sony electronic products because my computer sony sony-sony linkages make easy use . given , here what i think product : 1 . it amazing how much camera you get money . compared just 6 months ago , or year ago , this lot camera money . it very small , fits easily your pocket , but takes great pictures . also , it very easy use recharge . 2 . visit sony website , suggests sony new cameras coming out constantly -- new cameras very similar . this makes it hard compare cameras , even within sony brand , makes you feel if your camera obsolete minute you buy it . 3 . problem this camera , given it so small -- not shake . your pictures blurry . i am typical guy , very little fine motor control . my hands trouble holding small objects . holding this camera one hand taking picture -- well results not pleasant . 4 . i tend disappointed telephoto capabilities these small cameras . i guess if you really want zoom , then you go big camera . but it still seems like small cameras could offer more . 5 . said all , end , this camera small easy carry , light weight , durable , it also easy use . when you look it , it looks well made . i ended up giving camera my in-laws , because they lost theirs . my in-laws tend technologically challenged . i said them , just leave dial set little green camera , snap away . i say - they love this camera . overall . money , great purchase , technology amazing . just grab it two hands or develop steadier aim than i .	1
first all , i just looking decent camera ~ $200 took good clean pictures 6x zoom . i narrowed it down canon a710 this . since i didn't need few extra features canon , i went cheaper lz7 although i some reservations , i'm very happy my decision . i primarily use camera taking pictures my pets , family get togethers wildlife/nature pictures while hiking ... i've camera two months . pros : simple use , image stabilization works great , takes aa so you'll never run out batery power , there several different image size settings change accomadate use extended zoom ( up 9x . regular 6x ) , manual exposure controls , nice bright screen , battery life excellent using nimh batteries , price everything comes it . cons : there lag when flash used , but i think this common all cameras don't use lithium battery ; there no view finder although i haven't encountered situation where i've wanted one ; size little large " pocket camera " but any camera 6x optical zoom , it really not bad . i haven't really used camera nigh t-t ime party type shots , which i'm guessing would not problem . i also not used video capabilities , which based claims should excellent . overall , $200 , you'd hard pressed find 7 megapixel , 6x optical zoom camera excellent image stablization , excellent picture taking capabilities . seven years ago , i paid $180 1.8 megapixel fugi no zoom ... this camera awesome deal !	1
this camera shoots gorgeous pics movies . i picked it after some pretty intensive research . i wanted camera would capture all pics even low light stabilizer would give me steady pics even if person holding it shaky hands . i also wanted it so simple it icons obvious . ( other words , camera " point shoot " challenged . ) i wanted it easy get cheap batteries ( double a)and memory card ( my 2 gig sdm cost $29 ) i also wanted it download right my pictbridge printer event i didn't want power up my pc . just make it really fun , i wanted all this less than $250 . it deliver ? oh yeah	1
hey , whats really say , but it it job . i dig ilink because i hook it up my tv watch my minidv tapes my camcorder just this one cable ! also i use it my sony dvd recorder make dvd my camcorder . just one cable ... kool	1
i highly recommend this item sony handycams . i used belkin while , but this tops it over over . i can't tell you why but my video upload my handycam my computer lightning fast now i love it . thanks sony	1
i bought this camera my wife christmas 06 . she small canon point shoot great . she wanted something more zoom other features so she could take her photography level . this great camera ! controls well placed easy use . it tons pre-sets various settings etc . pictures very sharp . only thing my wife not sure first cameras size . she so loved way camera works pictures it produces she willing live it size . i think this camera going classic - gives slrs run money .	1
i am very impressed this flash excellent way camera controls it . inside it zooms match lens-view , which very impressive feature . exposure together flash dead-on my p880 which also lets me use built-in flash little extra fill ! recycle time also great flash only uses 2 batteries . i believe it based sunpak pz-40x series flash made non-kodak cameras . compared other manufactures flash pricing , full mrsp pretty decent current pricing great deal ! while this not marketed professional equipment , it enable you create top-notch indoor flash photos . you may consider getting sto-fen omnibounce it enable you diffuse light little bit bounce situations .	1
this lens great value . feels well constructed , opitical quality good(could better but not price range ) . it great beginers or amatuers . used lens 1 year no problems it . great range , 28mm very wide 35mm format cameras . great walk around lens . canon also amazing online customer support	1
bushnell pinseeker 1500 rangefinder ( non-slope model ) easy use constructed elements . after using pinseeker few rounds i quickly learned how focus acquire desired target matter seconds . i walk up my ball i pull out rangefinder , acquire target , put it back case hit shot without adding more then 10 seconds my preshot routine . this rangefinder most definately game improvement device helped me select right club , many cases made me aware i needed change clubs . my opinion it better then gps devices whereas you must course loaded or manually enter course info beforehand . if you ride golf car gps subject cart path only , then point where your ball lies only estimate actual yardage . pinseeker go any course world used immediately any part course . if you looking device help club selection game imporvement , then i would highly recommend pinseeker 1500 .	1
i really like this camera . it 10x optical , image stabilization , 3.0 inch lcd 230,000 pixels , more . size great 10x zoom camera . image stabilization great getting shots would come out blurry my canon powershot a620 . my other favorite feature besides zoom image stabilization , wide angle . it great finally get cityscapes whole skyline one shot !! camera set 16x9 , i get 24mm shot ! what i don't like this camera it short battery life . even the1300mah battery i bought , i get less shots than my canon . colors photos this camera lot less colorful than canon . something i get used . i very disappointed find out this camera no zoom movie mode , unlike its predecessor , tz1 . luckily , not stop me buying this camera . overall , this camera great buy , especially if you want i.s. wide angle , long zoom	1
i just received dmc-tz3a . i love this camera . this my first camera ever . i love features , build quality , menu system . i am still getting used learning how take quality pictures . example , i trouble getting it focus times . i am certain this just learning curve me . one feature i am disappointed it lacks - auto retraction lens when playback mode . most other cameras automatically retract lens protect it when viewing pictures camera . this one not this you turn camera off get it retract . i really wish they would update firmware support this important safety feature . all-in-all i definitely recommend this camera	1
lit shot properly , footage this camera 24p mode come very close 16mm film . this fantastic camera price , this new model worked out lot kinks earlier models . those you looking xl2 , it true this camera not interchangeable lens ( although wide-angle telephoto adapters available ) but camera feels more compact robust , more features ( like xlr ) built right into camera body vs . external attachments .	1

i've bought this camera year ago i am very happy it . batery charges fast lasts long , movies good quality ( clear , not blured , colors come out exactly same ) camera light enough . only problem i've so far you cannot record dark - movie comes out darker than it seemed you hardly see anything . otherwise i am more than happy camera	1
long story short , i 12 years experence personal security training consulting business . i install two or three these units outside every one my urban customers homes . commonly my customers problems their neihborhoods home break-ins , agressive vagrants , threats their dogs or restraining orders . i watch deterent effect these fake cameras these types people via real video capture cameras nearby all time . they often cross street or sheild there face they pass fake cameras . my customers advise me regular basis they see deterent effect all time . just spoke single female customer tonight who advises her agressive vagrant problem she her back street two years solved my install one these her back garage . she me installing two more these svat isc200 next week . you decrease chance your home invaded significantly installing these . best security deterent item you could add your home price , period ! you increase effectiveness printing out small little sign red black ink placing it under camera , warning they recorded . i usely use " smile ! you monitored recorded remote location ! " . if you plan placing real camera somewhere public access , put one these up first 30 days insure it not damaged . also use these " damage bait cameras " near real ones reduce chance getting real one damaged . check you fake cameras once week insure no one damaged it . you should also add few " beware dog " " no solicitors " signs homedept/lowes your gates near your front door ( regardless if you dog or not . ) . might not pretty , but combined fake cameras , creates significant deterance factor against all bad people . plan change batteries every 2-3 months . difficult get thing screw back once mounted , difficult get innner " camera " re-align when it pops out , i've recieved few doa ( thus , 4 out 5 star rating ) . hope this helps ! ( sorry spelling errors !	1
we've used lenmar rechargeables other digicams great results , so it no-brainer pick up this crv3 compatible battery new olympus camera . 1350 mah battery comes charging base two electric adapters ( wall outlet car cigarette lighter which not shown picture ) . nice plus choosing this lithium battery weighs less than pair nimh aa batteries yet it runs cooler so camera doesn't get too warm . battery charges few hours lasts quite while charges . we able shoot several hundred shots over multiple sessions without fully draining battery . only quibble we this charger related directions found one page instruction sheet : " once battery fully charged , promptly remove battery charger . note : not leave battery charger prolonged periods after battery fully recharged . " this battery can't left charging overnight ; it must monitored manually removed when cycle complete . why couldn't lenmar put auto-shutoff circuitry charger when light turns green just like their other chargers	1
it nice camera easy carry it fit your pocket i am satisfie	1
i several pocket digital cameras but this excellent . easy use i wanted longer zoom , this true 5x optical zoom . pictures came out very good battery life very good . my only complaint screen very hard see bright sunlight , but i think all cameras this range without viewfinder same problem . also , price great . i would recommend this camera i like blue color- it different rest	1
we bought this " swimming dolphins " excursion our honeymoon cruise it worked perfectly ! it easy set up , easy use , easy clean . i only wish we more opportunity use it , but pictures we get great	1
this case everything it advertized . i know ya can't scuba it , but i'm not diver so it doesn't bother me . i live hawaii , home wettest place earth , i use this thing almost daily . it very nice not worry your camera . it effectively keeps out rain , ocean , sand ( that really important one ) everything else . its fun watch all stupid tourists trying run down beach , snap their pics , then run away before they get wet , or wading into waterfall knee deep snap some pics . this case , you just jump right not worry . trust me , taking pics those funny tourists water fun hobby mine . update -- 5/31/06my o-ring bit " loose " some time . i still get it close watertight long i pay lot attention when i am shutting case make sure seal doesn't get pinched . canon offer replacement through canon parts , but it 16 bucks $7 shipping . i bought one intent examining it figuring out how make bunch new ones much cheaper . after all , it just piece rubber -- can't hard . i repost information if i am successful	1
this case works well camera , but elastic straps releasing flash significant design error . placing camera lens facing back case works much better . belt loop only measures 1.25 inches effectively , so it not work all belts . all all , case protect camera , which why i bought it	1
ideal case panasonic ps-slx2 . easy open / close , sturdy nice design . highly recommended	1
this foldout-prong charger came my canon camera functions perfectly . however , travel i prefer canon cb-5l which same except long cord rather than prongs . why ? because plugged-in cg-580 too easy forget when you check out hotel room . ( i forgot similar item once . ) yes , cb-5l cord bulkier , but i never carry battery charger my camera bag anyway . cord means i perform gymnastics only once during stay inexpensive european hotels where electrical outlets oddly placed . also , foreign outlets sometimes deeply recessed , even plug adapter , appliances plug flush wall may not connect all way unless you stack adapters . both units dual voltage , so that not problem . listen voice experience . .	1
i love my new camera !!! this my first video camera there definitely no buyers remorse here . it soooo user friendly ! i researched many cameras found this one most suitable my needs . my company subcontracted work production company my camera ( pv-gs250 ) used secondary camera b-roll it fabulous . footage almost seamless two cameras when it edited . i'm very happy my purchase look forward using it more more	1

easy get up running , unit goes into slideshow mode after power automatically . picture quality excellent . easy put pictures memory card them show up . recommend re-cropping your pictures 16x9 aspect ratio so you get full picture . unit accomodate std . 4x6 format well , but not fill screen . small quirks : - when slideshow mode , you can't hit pause button zoom . - very poorly designed stand collapse after couple weeks . - documentation lacking ( typical coby style ) - no support quicktime video popular some digital cameras - unit faint lingering glow screen after power down which doesn't go away unless you unplug unit	1
i just received my coby dig . frame . put 25 pics memory chip stuck into device . pressed slide show it started working . minimum frame time 5 seconds i wish it faster my needs ( window display gallery ) , color not perfect , but it only $107 . so i'll live it	1
we canon powershot s50 3 years ago , loved it . so this time when my husband wanted buy digital compact camera , we specifically looked canons . we originally thinking getting sd 700,800 or something like . but after we compared these cameras together store near us . we found out sd900 finest lcd display , more opitions control panel ... so we came back bought it amazon ( our favorite online store ) . we used it our last trip grand cayon , lv , sf etc . this sd900 takes very good pictures , especially good lighting conditions . colors also smooth rich . downside , you may already read others ' reviews , no battery indication , no raw(it ok , my husband doesn't much editiing anyway , it too much ask campact camera offer ) , control panel sensitive ... don't get frustrated if you happened pressed wrong button couldn't figure way out during time shooting . stich great function which comes , but when very bright area , you not see stich alignment very well lcd screen ( i guess it common trouble all digital compact cameras which relay lcd dispay ) . overall , it wonderful camera , we love it . it my husband camera , i uses canon 350d , but i borrow it my husband sometimes because it tiny compares my 10 lbs " moose " it takes very good pictures .	1
this camera takes great pictures all time . i haven't one picture turned out bad . it also very easy use there lots fun things you it . i would recommend this camera anyone	1

i bought this camera my daughter pretty impressed . it easy use , takes great pictures , lot options , very small ( pocket-sized ) . fact it kind depressing because i paid $250 5mp this time last year . you need memory card this camera . internal memory only holds 3 pics highest res . 1 gb which hold 400 pics . only thing i would warn you : if you try use used memory card , you need format it camera though menu , or windows , befor you use it . i tried use one my old camera transfer software wouldn't work two different computers , it kept saying " enumerating " never read pics . after formatting card , it fine . also , this camera claims support only specific sd cards sandisk , panasonic toshiba , which weird because i thought sd standard . see page 102 manual	1

this good battery canon digital cameras . this cta digital db-nb4l battery original canon batery both used take digital photos during recent mexican cruise . this cta digital battery worked well .	1
first off , let me make it clear i am satisfied this camera . i it 8 months now i put it through its paces its held up fine . but there few things you must know : camera no zoom . i mean , practically no zoom . 2.2 may look decent but its pointless any real-life situation . you find yourself moving lot your camera get better shot , not standing one place using zoom feature . you never get close wide shot - its just not possible this camera . this camera great average stills but that it . you click twice take picture or " press halfway then fully " according manual . this major pain . sometimes when battery weak , it may take lot time take picture ( lot frustration ) , so this not cam capture any special pictures or " kodak moments " . apart these cons , camera great value money offers video all kinds stuff . if you're looking mostly looking take landscape or portrait stills , this camera good job	1
cute , compact , easy use - these just few ways describe canon cool a400 ! this stylish digital camera lightweight perfect snapping shots go . mine sunset gold . plus , there perks like macro mode ( which lets you snap sharp pictures close 2 inches ) , lots shooting modes ( like snow fireworks ) . movie mode lets you capture video clips sound . this camera takes great , crisp photos . it easy use , great value . just what you would expect canon	1
got this almost year ago it completely changed way my photographs . amazing light most indoor photographs . i got product shots , abstract shots fantastic portraits using this great unit . definitely recommended anyone who wants shoot anything indoor .	1
this great purchase my purposes - birding wildlifing . i get used turning center-focus ring finger , zoom lever index-finger position . use full zoom , you really need total stability , but half zoom very useful even moving kayak . right-eye focus ring right up against eyecups hard move unless you twist open eyecups , which case focus ring fine . focus crispness not quite what i hoped full zoom , but still good seeing field marks . one big advantage light weight . this set light smaller nikon i lost . very nice	1
binoculars past either way too expensive or too cheap , i wanted new pair would replace pair loaned out , then lost . opportunity presented itself form trip canada this past september , which required something would able capture canadian rocky vistas , but also not so heavy i would feel like needing cart stow them . nikon eagleview binoculars seem fill bill ( not too expensive , but also not too heavy ) . they great zoom feature easily changed well able easily focus one hand . my only complaint while zooming subject , light level reduced , which occurs naturally due nature optics . you can't everything , but these just right , allowing my wife i use them time time again while observing nature . summary , good pair all-around use !	1

you get much expected this price range . 4x objective ( see meade example lacks it ) very desirable . 15x eyepice give acceptable quality 600x avoids much need go oil immersion lens . almost everything works quite nicely . i would recommend not using oil comes microscope - cedar oil . this older type oil slightly yellow harder clean than modern synthetics . buy tube modern low viscosity immersion oil edmund scientific or similar supplier . i found this oil works great 1000x 1500x this microscope cleans off reasonably easily isopropyl alchohol . i would definitely recommend purchasing this microscope , but also consider similar featured revelation iii lw scientific . it very slightly superior features , slightly higher price , company specializes microscopes ( vs . celestron , where their customer service knows almost nothing microscopy ; they telescope experts ) . there few tiny initial problems microscope . one eyepiece small optical defect near its periphery . celestron immediately exchanged it flawless one . iris diaphram came very slightly off center . there adjusment screws correct this . alignment error so small i haven't bothered fixing it . color filters , design , placed right top ( nice ) halogen light source . compare lw-scientific model mentioned which fileter holder few other light source advantages . fyi : achromat objectives typical ( no better , no worse ) amount spherical aberation outer edge , giving you 2/3 field view sharpest focus precisely flat specimen ( e.g. quality blood smear ) . this not defect this price range . apochromat plan objectives ahieve 95+% freedom spherical aberation cost much or more one lens than this microscope costs . this microscope uses standard lens sizes so it readily upgrade better eyepieces objectives acommodate kits specialized microscopy ( dark field , phase contrast , etc . ) , well accepting standard through eyepiece digital image capture accessories .	1
well !, i just purchased this sony a100 body only $[ ... ] no kit lens me . i bought sigma 28-105mm 2.8 af it . reason i bought this a100 because i got sony r1 few months back , r1 really impressed me its results images zeiss lens , thats motivated me buy sony dslr too , sony got great colors balance , contrasty , sharp , good dynamic range , not like other brands while colors off yellow cast . a100 small light compare other dslrs , it made malasia light plastic , not real pro body , but more like consumer camera , its good me cuz i need light dslr , a100 fast camera many ways , fast buffer refreshing time , review , delete , start up , af fast too . images stunning sharp help its body super steady shot . colors well balance , bright , neutral . lcd backside 2 neat features : if you turn camera vertical lcd turns vertical too , so you see info before shooting . when you put your eyes eye piece look thru view finder , it got smart sensor turn off lcd backside save batt life . super steady shot body really helps , now i buy any lenses sure all image stabilizer shots . small thing bother me a100 shutter slap noise when shoot , it clumsy ( clunk)sound it . price i paid , its best dslr its range . advantage a100 you buy many other lenses it like : minoltas , zeiss , sonys , sigmas , tamrons , tokinas , vivitars , quantaray.im happy mine , highly recommended whom who wants fast , light , small , good colors dslr . not mention good price too.im watching new coming sony pro dslrs coming june 07 . i use my a100 opteka battery grip , you see my review it here amazon , just hit search opteka grip .

if you pretty much any digital camera want closeups or see what you're taking pix before flash , you need this or similar light . german company makes high-wat led video light but it speckled pattern , not good closeup stills . light pattern this very even . closeup up light one hand camera other , cover object 6 8 inches . pull back widen light 2 feet or more across . keep video light close camera possible , reduce shadows camera sees . even outdoors 9000 ' colorado i found use this , taking picture shady trail where plant half shade , fix this . bulbs replaceable . yet 4 years one bulb never wore out , heavy usage , 8 hours time . ( 3 fp-970 batteries , such batterybarn.com sells give you 8 hours light . last time i got it off amazon , fp960 $47 computer brain . new 15 hour camcorder batteries power this light 2 1/2 hours)the onlything eventually broke switch . don't force it , push down middle safety button when turning it or eventually break it . take battery out when travelling so won't go accidentally . you add grip getting disk shaped tripod adaptor screwing hand grip such hakuba monopod / tablepod combo ( most comfortable grip there , $25 places like fry ) into tripod adapter . it gets warm , almost hot but keeps running no problem vent slits . even using it caving anza-borrego , we knew we sure 2 hours li-ion batteries . anyway , indoor shooting converence halls bad flourescent lighting , this brings out colors . you can't use flash closer than 2 feet most objects or you get too much glare reflection .. so use video light instead serious indoor shooting where you can't fixed light stand . use it 10 watt mode most objects , tall or dark objects , switch 20 watt . when battery starting run low , light only go into 10 watt mode . i sony video light 3watt dvd-403 . i keep this top camera sometimes when too much hassle get out video light . but it drains camcorder battery unlike this one , light output alot lower . good small objects tho . all means , turn flash when farther than 2 ' object looks slightly dark . this helps alot your pix . if it looks ok viewfinder / lcd leave flash off ! see flashlightreviews.com general light patterns battery life other flashlights incl led lights you might want buy . if sony would just come out led version i'd happy lark ! it would last 10 hours or more . most flashlights throw uneven ring pattern so unsuitable lighting photos	1
it great . i hadn't any problem phone interference . i recommend	1
best camera this price class . feature amazing , must feature . only complaint flash recharge time little slow due 2 aa batteries . if you take lots indoor pics , go canons 4 aa batteries ( a6xx ) . sports kids this great camera	1
last year , after extensive research , i bought canon a540 replace my trusty olympus d40-zoom . my goals camera selection where ( ) compact size , ( ) standard aa batteries , ( ) full manual controls , ( ) outstanding image quality , ( ) speed , ( ) optical viewfinder . a540 fit bill almost perfectly , handful limitations i noted my review . this year , canon release a570is , i decided upgrade , driven addition optical image stabilization ( ) . while impressive , i surprised other improvements canon made . image noise levels significantly lower more controlled higher iso captures . digic iii processor seems make more intelligent decisions lighting flash exposure , especially when its face recognition engaged . add dramatically better quality lcd screen , slightly higher 7.1 mp resolution , improved case , support high capacity sd cards , i doubt i'll need upgrade any time soon . like a540 , a570is me perfect balance size , speed , photo quality . a570is same physical size a540 . it small enough fit coat pocket or small belt case yet uses 2 aa batteries . like a540 , overall processing speed very fast unless you're taking flash pictures ( then you should expect 4-6 seconds flashes depending battery level what flash strength camera selected ) . note flash time significantly better high-capacity rechargeable nimh batteries than standard aas . , unlike some other cameras i tried , speed user interface ( especially during playback ) very fast . picture quality general excellent , even low light situations . noise higher iso significantly more controlled than a540 , perhaps benefit new 7.1 mp ccd digic iii image processor . according documentation , noise reduction applied slow shutter speeds 1.3 seconds or greater , this slightly slow down sho t-t o-shot time . there no option disable or adjust noise processing , but my experience results very good . when noise reduction applied , there slight loss detail compared a540 , but results noticeably better a570is its built-in noise reduction than post-processing noise pictures taken a540 . my own head-to-head comparisons a570is a540 , a570is better light metering noticeably sharper detail indoor shots without flash ( especially when image stabilization engaged ) . a570is favor slightly higher iso auto modes than a540 , giving generally better results without flash . however , when taking close-up pictures flash , a570is doesn't seem select anything lower then iso 200 , sometimes requiring manual iso override program mode . a570is offers new iso 1600 mode , but i'm not quite sold it . without tripod , under low light conditions , iso 1600 offer opportunity blur-free photographs not possible iso 800 . but level noise artifacts noise processing don't give very usable picture . a570is raises bar optical image stabilization , which only works when camera held horizontally . one biggest limitations consumer digital cameras need hold camera steady get clear shot . higher zooms night shots this problem compounded . i've taken number shots without , it useful but not " magic bullet " poor shots . small details like far-away signs night become clear when engaged . you set run continuously during preview , only when shutter released ( slightly lower battery drain ) , only vertical movement ( better objects moving horizontally ) , or disabled ( i yet find reason so ) . , unlike many cameras i've seen , works video capture mode . like a540 , a570is offers full manual controls . a570is , canon adds two more modes ( kids pets indoor ) mode selector wheel ( instead find them special scene menu ) . a570is also adds new aquarium scene mode , while removing useless color swap color accent modes . canon also removed " my camera " customization menu ( changing startup picture various sounds ) which i never used my a540 . although i never expected use it , movie mode excellent . it still not replacement dedicated camcorder . but i used it number occasions capture audio video when picture just won't . standard movie mode 640x480 ( vga ) quality 30fps , but you raise capture 60 fps 320x240 , or lower it 15fps 160x120 . a570 now capture video up 1 hour or 4gb whichever comes first . video files very large ( around 1.9 mb/second 30fps ) but they compress extremely well quicktime pro mpeg4 codec . a570is , canon also addressed some my minor complaints a540 . most notably , lcd screen much higher quality higher resolution . case plastics seem more solid , small rubber door covering usb - a/v - power ports pivots open side not top , handle area no longer chrome insert which tendency fall off . ring covers conversion lens adapter mount chrome trim , making camera more attractive but least my a570is it more difficult remove than a540 . once again , i looked canon a710is which offers 6x optical zoom , but same 7.1 mp sensor , optical image stabilization user interface older digic ii image processor . end , after trying both cameras store , i again settled a570is . a710is noticeably larger ( 0.25 inches wider slightly taller ) , more complicated lens takes longer startup zoom . both cameras limited number stops their zoom range , but this noticeable 6x a710is where it not noticeable 4x a570is . me , larger size wasn't worth extra zoom . benefits digic iii impressive . summary , canon a570is pros : - 7.1 megapixel sensor , 4x optical zoom- iso 80 1600- optical image stabilization higher iso or zoom , even during video capture- optical viewfinder shooting lcd off- full manual controls ( shutter priority , appeture priority , full manual)- preset custom white balance control- outstanding photo quality , even relatively low light ( good color balance , very low noise higher isos , almost non-existent chromatic aberation)- digic iii processor offers face detection , makes more intelligent decisions exposure , flash levels- very good results built-in noise reduction slow shutter speeds 1.3 seconds or greater- very fast startup sho t-t o-shot speed ( flash not withstanding)- excellent speedy auto-focus even low light ( although af assist light slow this down)- orientation sensor recognizes if you rotated camera take shot- flash adjusts angle based wide-telephoto zoom- built-in red eye reduction during playback lets you select area remove red eye save new or overwrite existing image- surprisingly usable movie mode - outstanding user interface : options well laid out easy locate , very well thought-out record playback options- extremely fast user interface playback performance , even zooming photos- high resolution lcd screen- well built case , very comfortable grip- uses sd cards supports high-capacity sdhc ( takes advantage high-speed sd)- uses 2 aa batteries ( least 2500 mah nimh rechargeable recommended)- very good battery life ( approx 400 shots 2 rechargeable nimh aa , display on)- replaceable lithium battery protects settings when changing batteries- supports optional high-power flash , conversion lenses underwater casecons ( me , all very minor ): - flash recharge time acceptable but not great ( 4 - 6 seconds shots using nimh batteries)- preview display blanks while flash recharges- auto iso indoor flash close-up pictures doesn't seem select below iso 200 ; you force iso 100 program or manual modes- iso 1600 questionable real-world use because noise artifacts noise reduction- noise reduction cannot adjusted or disabled- it possible insert sd card upside down you don't realize until you try close cover ( would easy break cover if you force this)- markings battery orientation difficult read- no raw image support , but you select 3 different compression ratios image qualitytips : 1 ) make sure you low-level format before you use your sd card this camera , even if you formatted it canon camera . it makes significant difference sho t-t o-shot speed2 ) always use high-capacity ( 2500 mah or greater ) nimh rechargeable batteries - flash recharge time much improved ( though still 4-6 seconds)3 ) indoor flash close-up shots , may need override iso 100 better quality4 ) outdoor shots bright sun , setting exposure -2/3 gives better control bright areas5 ) if you use conversion lens adapter , don't plan using built-in flash which partially obscured adapter . i haven't tried it , but would expect external flash not this problem	1
i admit , i new whole camera buying experience . frankly , i hate responsible keeping track something so small expensive when i am out getting wasted , but i am glad i made purchase . i needed something would help me remember what happened night before . it simple use , there isn't one those confusing wheels top funky symbols . this guy knows what i'm talking . since i dreading carry around camera , size definitely issue . when i took camera out box , its size blew my mind . if there one downfall i've noticed , it camera almost too small . make sure you use wrist strap when using ... especially if you drink much i ... wow ! anyone spare liver i could borrow ? preferably one clean free cirrhosis	1

my coolpix 8800 image stabilization zoom real pleasure use . i just wish somebody pointed one thing out me . when i finally got my computer upgraded handle large files , tried some camera raw files , nikon pictureproject reported raw ( . nef ) file un supported . when i went nikon web site which listed update process raw files , it asked my camera serial number . it then rejected number message i might camera wasn't nikon us camera , cancelled download . i'm not sure how this could avoided , but recommend any purchaser nikon camera register it immediately while they send it back refund if it doesn't meet nikon us requirements . i still like nikon cameras lenses , but i point out this problem anyone asking how i like my camera	1
i've owned 5700 , then 8700 , now 8800 . i've also owned half-dozen high-level 35 mm film cameras over years , beginning nikon s2 1950s ^|^ . 8800 fine upgrade 10x zoom vr fabulous ! i lot macro work , tripods not really always necessary these new days . best all image quality : vibrant , plenty " snap , " when recorded 8fine jpeg , easily enlargeable/croppable really big prints , resolution spare . af works well , controls more logically placed than its predecessors , still far more bells whistles than i'll ever use but they're not way . one terrific digicam . complaints : all accessories unique available only great price nikon . bah	1

after i spent much money my s80 , i wanted find perfect case carry it around i am very picky ! this first one i considered , but after so many bad reviews , i marked it off my list kept looking . i bought semi-hard case bodyglove but abandoned it because it too large it made me not want take my camera anywhere . then i bought cheap 3.99 case target super small light protected my camera well enough scratches while my purse but offered no screen protection . it slightly too small zipper kept catching strap i always stuff it . finally , i decided buy this case despite negative reviews when i saw my sister canon case her s450 . this just what i looking all ! it soft form fitting so it still fit my purse . it easy get my camera out quickly so i don't miss those shots ! it even hard front back so i know screen wont get scratched or punctured while my bag . so if this sounds like kind case you looking , don't scared away negative reviews !	1
i just needed nice , slim case protect outer casing my camera -- i wasn't looking anything heavy duty , no storage compartments , no bulky padding . love it	1
i am completely satisfied overall value this camera . picture quality great it very easy use . lcd clean bright . video capture lacks little , but price i don't think you could get any better .	1
i purchased this my son he really likes everything camera . he loves quality pictures . he mention camera proprietary cable hooks his computer - just fyi	1
i bought this tripod short while ago , i'm extremely glad i . it very light easy carry around , even without carrying bag or even handle , neither which it comes . bubble level built into it very handy works well . little practice , you break set it , camera attached , 10 15 seconds ( provided you keep quick release tab screwed bottom your camera , like i ) , so you won't miss once lifetime shot . it also very inexpensive easy use , head fantastic range movement . while legs , when fully extended , don't bring it all way up eye level , it brings it close enough keep you comfortable while looking through camera . if need , just buy small folding travel chair carry you use tripod	1
i bought this amazon more than $40 .. now it $5 less after only 2 weeks . sheesh .. anyway , tripod itself stylish it black color very useful because it 3 way pan it maximum height around 56 " . it lightweight it seems durable enough normal photoshoot sessions . if only this case or something , then it easier carry anywhere you go . might buy separate case purpose	1
well i bought this wed night recieved it fri night , you just love amazons free shipping , it simply amazes me how fast they ship out . now tripod , its mostly metal which i like its all black which i also like . it bubble level which comes very handy when outdoors uneven surfaces . all controls move very nice smooth which my biggest concern buying tripod online not able try it first hand . though i read some reviews online this tripod i happy what i read . i only wish it handle make it easier carry but i only seen bigger tripods handle . all all its great i love it , also it only 5.94 since i used my 25gc amazon weeeeeeeeeeif you dont want spend much i def recommend this one it out performs all crap circuit city offer	1
update 3/06 : well , after using this camera 3 months i come back following feedback : -it heavier bulkier than many 5mp cameras ( not fit standard pocket-size portable camera bag)-sometimes people lips come out black or purple pictures-the shutter lag time annoying ( someone reported above ) . i haven't yet figured out setting where camera take one shot exactly when i press button if i just took shot within last few seconds . so i get few pictures people frozen smiles their faces or miss some shots . anyone offer some advice this sticky situation ? -other than , i still love camera - great resolution if you red-eye reduction it works pretty well , battery easy rechargeoriginal review : i purchased nikon coolpix 8400 12/05it rated first advanced compact digital cameras category consumer reports 11/05we got big discount buying this camera through amazon.com when there limited-time promotionit actually shipped ritz cameracomes neck strap , battery charger ! not built-in memory so you need separately buy compact flash card . high-speed cf card would good idea . i would also recommend you buy extra rechargeable battery camera case . per specs : " coolpix 8400 , lens cap , strap , usb cable , audio video cable , rechargeable li-ion battery en-el7 , battery charger mh-56 , remote controller ml-l3 , pictureproject cd-rom " i changed settings take pictures " fine " resolution they running 1,600 - 2,500 kb size . " extra fine " mode also available but i don't think i need use it unless taking super-important photo . we upgrading nikon coolpix 5200 ( zoom button broke when i dropped it deck ) . 8400 black , not silver , bit larger/heavier . this digital camera big step up . 8400 seems better red-eye correction good backlit mode . some people complained nikon camera red-eye correction automatic , whether you like it or not , however 8400 you not need worry because it optional	1
i rated this camera 5 two reasons : 1 . ) highly polished product steal price . 2 . ) it more than i asked when i walked into store . i bought olympus d-460 $450 long time ago . 1.3 mp 3x optical zoom . then i bought this , 5mp 6x optical zoom * stabilization * quarter cost other one . i went looking 5mp w/3x optical zoom removable storage expectation dropping $200 . i ... but i also walked out 1gb sd card in-store repair plan . i've enough experience digital cameras know some type plan virtual necessity . no , this not high end camera , nor it pretend . but if you want something decent resolution , bunch presets , yet still allows you customize your own shot , then this your camera . i've snapping pictures ever since i got home it ... taking some really difficult shots ... tv ... computer . stuff dark closet . only thing it couldn't take decent picture me ... then again , professional photographer $3000 camera photoshop couldn't get good picture me . : -	1
i very pleased this easy use camera . it takes very good quality pictures price can't beat	1
such simple product difference lighting my photos dramatically increased when added my sb600 . when taking close up photos faces lit up come out very clear . definitely great addition my camera gear	1
i bought this lark , it just seemed like such fun though i bought it back dec , i finally really used it today wedding , i shocked ! it took great video inside church where my ( low end ) digital camera could not . i wasn't sure how video would actually turn out , but it great considering time things i paid $[ ... ] it . built software wonderful ( though i wish i could download it computer ) i made " movie mix " wedding camcorders software how fun ! shoot , $[ ... ] if all i got wedding video it worth it . i really couldn't believe how clear video this little " toy ! " i don't understand any negative reviews , it cheap , it fun it heck lot [ ... ] bucks . pure digital inc . $[ ... ] rebate their website . buy it , use it , fun !	1
i one those holdouts carried lots prime lenses , disdaining zooms " compromise " . no doubt , i missed some fine lenses because this . lens sold me zooms this lens , 16-45 f/4 pentax . lack distortion , contrast , fine color control , all finally convinced me zoom perform some functions prime . i've using this lens while . my studio , 50mm primes become main portrait lenses digital cameras . but now , i'm not afraid use zoom lens job . big step me ! it extends quite far when zooming , fact i don't like , those who care , on-camera flash blocked lens hood ( i use studio strobe , so it no import me ) . modern lens , it polycarbonate barrel ( they don't seem inclined make zooms lmited series . too bad ) . if i could use it film cameras , i probably would . no aperture ring means it definitely meant current cameras . despite all , i highly recommend this lens . it great " walk around " lens , going very wide moderate telephoto ( remember , it aps-c sensors ) . image quality astounding old grouch who loves primes , even lens general it right up there . if you're faced choice kit lens or this lens , take 16-45 . if you serious your craft , or you make living it , it well worth price	1
it very small , extremely well made , works perfectly . belkin pure hdmi cables also great value . no signal degradation noted this switchbox - seems completely transparent . i would buy one	1
it great camera quality price . only downside it so small , i am used camera feels weighs like camera . ( i think it little smaller than deck cards ) so if you want small , this camera you . or if you want great camera you adjust compactness , purchase this camera	1
i tried digital . i really . but i could never get really gorgeous shots i got my old yashica slr which gave up ghost several years back . i also could not really " focus " what i shooting ... just pointed shot because there no film run out . result ? pointless pics weren't even good looking . digital just didn't feel " right . " so 8 months ago i decided go back film . what get ? after much research , i finally decided canon t2 . absolutely brilliant camera . my favorite feature ? i let camera handle focus , etc . or i go completely manual . may not seem like big deal , but it feels so good control what camera when you want . course , means letting your imagination go ... something sorely lacking digital . couldn't happier no more pointless pics . okay , maybe few , but they still look good . isn't point	1
i got this after switching digital camera . digital cameras didn't offer depth i wanted not proofs big drawback . i am no means expert photography , but i know great photograph when i see one , this camera takes beautiful shots . this beautiful camera . elegant design ; grey body black accents definately attention grabber . people look your camera . it definately brains back up it beauty . loading film easy quick . it 8 or so presets . there automatic " point shoot " mode which you'll probably use most . it automatically compensates light , adjusting shutter speed aperture perfect shot . quick autofocus allows you grab your shot quickly , without waiting camera decide take picture . it also settings portrait shots , close ups , night , landscape , no flash , many others . those settings maximize camera features those particular shot . it also program setting where you program shutter speed , aperture , flash film advance . though comprehensive presets , i don't think you'll ever need use it . 28-90 lens comes kit nice , selector autofocus or manual focus . it also , course , removed so you add other lenses . zoom powerful leads beautiful shots . overall this unbelievable camera . great price , features , pictures best you've ever seen . they very crisp , clear almost 3d lifelike quality them , something i've never seen outside professionally taken photograph . this camera awesome	1
i looked digital cameras months - literally - before i just decided lug around 35 mm slr . everyone probably already knows , megapixels matter whole lot when you're talking blowing picture up larger size . what great film unless picture taken out focus , or bad light , you use negative blow something up quality really doesn't start go down until you're making huge prints . ( how huge exactly i don't know , but biggest i've blown up around 4x4 feet , still no trouble . ) prints i've gotten out this camera so far stellar . ( i use fuji film -- i think it better than kodak , even though kodak better commercials . give it try ! )the camera itself not too heavy , granted , it not convenience tiny digital camera , but it not bad i'd expected carry it around all day . neck strap nice , manual actually easy comprehend . i like camera buttons lot it features body -- it seems complicated first , but once you know how use features , they're much easier access than they would if you scrolling through menu . t2 seems worth hundred or so more dollars than you would pay very similar rebel k2 canon . one thing - make sure you take batteries out if you're not going using it week or more . it seems like they go dead if they're camera , even if it off	1
when my exilim ex-750 fell cooler , it over . i loved camera , but couldn't bring myself get refurbished one almost price what i paid 15 months prior . so , i " upgraded " exilim ex-z1050 . it even easier user than z-750 . changing most used settings very quick . lcd bright outdoors , so even though there no tiny viewfinder it not problem . i highly recommend this camera	1
just got this camera few days ago i admit i hesitant buy it because bad reviews z1000 got . my video camera built 4 megapixel camera , but i not happy quaily still pictures , so i started looking around several months . i love look , i taken tons pictures outside inside quality excellent ! i love quick burst mode taking many pictures same time . buy this camera , it incredible deal awesome camera	1
all around positive experiance ordering this camera . reasonably priced arrived time . i'am very please	1
i bought this ring fit wide angle lens my sony dsc-w1 it perfect fit . i love it . very high quality . only drawback , course , how lens blocks flash little	1
what i say ? i needed it connect zoom lens sony camera . worked great	1
this sunpak flash very nice flash price . it very cheap compared other 3rd party flash manufactures . auto mode this flash works really well . i say exposure calculated flash accurate 90% time given under normal lighting . there might some tricky lighting conditions could fool flash auto mode ... but then again , nothing perfect . i use this flash my fujifilm s9100 digital camera it very simple use . even though it might take some pratice , but it shouldn't scare you using manual flash . plus , you should feel like " real " photographer if you able use manual flash . just tell flash what iso you using how far subject camera , flash rest . return , camera tell you what aperature use . shutter speed , just set it highest speed your camera could synchronize external flash everything should ok . also , if you feel exposure little too dark or too bright , just adjust shutter speed step time compensate it . battery life , i get 100 shots out 4 rechargeable batteries ( nimh 2500 mah ) . anyway , this really reliable flash money . you don't really spend big bucks original manufacture flash such nikon or canon . just get sunpak flash it should work same , if not better . thanks reading .	1
i recently purchased gl2 , am very pleased results i'm getting so far . image quality great , especially such small lightweight camera . manual focus really nice . zoom amazing . should you buy this camera ? maybe . gl2 falls into odd mid range . if you just want easy use camcorder great image quality , i'd probably reccommend one small panasonic 3ccd cameras . if you want digital camcorder broadcast quality video or high definition , then you want step up next level . so , basically you could spend under $1000 get good simple camcorder , or you could get next level quality $4000+ . but this price -- $2200 -- this camera great . even though it not 24p , there something image me very well suited film ..	1
i wanted shoot my first short film , so i shopped shopped until i found this one , best price best features , looking back , i should saved my money . websites like mandy.com others , you easily make film putting 2k towards hiring junior or if your lucky , mid level dp w/ their own better equipment 200-400 day . if you short film mind dedicated work ethic w/ tight scheduling , you make entire film this way . but- if you want shoot get used holding cam setting shot angle lights actors everything else incvolved , this perfect starter cam . i actually wish i would saved up cash bought 24p cam like dvx100 or xl2 but this great entry level kids shooting their first flicks which mostly garbage anyways so ... make up your own mind	1
i dsc-r1 ( see my other review ) recently added telephoto accessory lens sony toolbox . oh , its companion " adapter " too . this not cheap lens nor it lightweight one , but it seems good one . front element this baby nearly 5 " diameter . what get you ? no loss f-stop start . that right , light-gathering ability sony addition already phenomenal optics carl zeiss vario sonnar costs nothing terms your ability " paint light " . ( your credit card , different calculation may appear . ) size lens makes necessary adapter " sidekick " mounting bracket . why ? without it , lens unbalanced , rather than cheap screw-on extender , this allows primary lens gain few elements become credible telephoto . it also advantage allowing quick removal tele use zoom primary lens adapter place . so you vision running sidelines capturing every grimace quarterback face defense floods over him ? not this lens . spring $ 8,000 canon outfit , get two you might get sacked yourself , assistant hand you your equipment . hiking into outback capture dawn mating kookaburra ? there better choices . ( note friends kookaburra : i seen one , heard one , but no actual experience their reproductive practices . ) other hand , if you occasionally need bit more reach manage tripod mounting , then all means pick one up . speaking " picking one up " , this lens hand-held deliver acceptable results ( better than using digital zoom or enlarging get same magnification ) , but only nearly still subjects . example , yacht race race deck club . ( my choice ) digital zoom ( 2x 120mm ) lower mega-pixels good enough , but not great . natural 200mm beats stretched 120mm any day , which what you get digital zoom alternative , but fast shooting combo may too , shall we say " bulky " . which brings me my main point : why we doing this ? photography i mean . if you see camera way capture visual poetry your mind sees , then this camera combo work you , you'll enjoy experience . if you see camera cool tool makes statement who you , well join gear heads photo chat rooms natter max-mega-pixel-mania spurn " point-and-shoot " favor bag full expensive interchangeable lenses . frankly , some best photographs all time captured spur moment , " point shoot " . excellent 24mm-120mm lens mounted camera , you'll get shot 95% time . if you need stretch you view bit farther time-to-time , all means spend $400 or so this telephoto combo look forward some good photography	1

i bought my k10d dec 06 after owning number pentax cameras over years very pleased engineering . combination features , if executed properly , make this camera best buy 10mp dslrs right now . i postponed my review because i wanted get some real field experience . i just went mexico , panicked because i left camera instruction manual behind . i now report trip . i little fumbling first , mainly because i didn't manual , but i soon able find combinations i wanted , camera performed both flexibly intuitively . af button exposure compensation button very well placed . i found myself difficult lighting situations often , both af exposure metering worked quite well . i also took some hand-held shots i normally would use tripod ( such 450mm ) , very few came out fuzzy because camera movement . few cases , i used bracketing , easily able obtain good balance details one or more bracketed shots . exposure metering worked so well i stopped bracketing . i particularly liked display modes : i could boost brightness see display even bright daylight , deep zooming gave me good check whether shot " soft " or not right scene . rechargeable li ion batteries , although not readily available stores , seem last forever ( even using power zoom , full-bright display , some fill flash ) . i believe i could shot all week ( 700 shots raw ( dng ) + jpeg ) battery grip attached . summary , this camera pleasure hold , very easy use manipulate , resulted high percentage crisp photos ( even if percentage well-composed shots lower because photographer ) . i bought it because its compatibility pentax lenses , 10mp sensor , shake-reduction technology , larger display , especially dust water seals . but what makes me quite happy it its overall ease use good results . i am still discovering its features , but i already know this camera frees me creative ways other cameras not past . some features this camera unique ( new program lines ) some available only cameras costing several hundred dollars more , making k10d good choice best buy . once again pentax , engineering supurb .	1
i owned * ist dl 8 month bought this upgrade . i don't any experience cannon or nikon . so my review mostly based comparison * ist dl . hope this help those same situation . i am not pro not pro . so i only need decent but inexpensive camera handful choice lenses . i bought k10d mainly ( 1 ) shake reduction ( 2 ) dust removal ( 3 ) raw button ( 4 ) 10mb ccd . course , there plenty other features expect . this pice level , i think k10d beats cannon nikon any others . plus , i da 50-200mm couple m42 takumar manual lenses . sticking pentax best me . after 150 test shots , i share you some my opinions : pros : -- shake reduction great ( but it its limit) -- dust removal comes handy -- raw button very useful -- manual choice any one 11 focus points , great composition -- faster focus than * ist dl -- rich functions , e.g. sv mode , program line -- support iso 100cons : -- weather-seal not mean too much if you don't get weather-sealed lenses -- 10m not much bigger than 6m (* ist dl ) , it good but don't expect big difference ( but this not pentax or k10d problem) -- battery meter drop full empty without stopping half-empty status -- pentaprism viewfinder not brighter than pentamirror my * ist dl ( least no noticable difference) -- shutter release not crispy * ist dl ( just personal feeling)it bigger heavier than ist dl . great ergo design . i am happy k10d . i take one star off cons listed . ps : ccd/stablizer slides inside ( even power off ) when you flip camera . little scary when i first got it . but after some reading i think it " normal " .	1

i've tested other pacific digital frames feature using any standard 8x10 frame really what i like most . i got this unit ( which comes dlink usb 802.11 dongle ) tested it my linksys router . after configuring windows correctly ( which they now posted web site ) , i able see frame my pc bundled software . there small learning curve , but i really like this method copying over photos instead wires . it takes same amount time you name frames if you mulitple units ( like living room , office , etc ) . overall this best resolution units i've seen removing wires gooood	1
not only this product allow us bring our camera into water get some really cool pics while we caribbean ; it also gave us peace mind knowing our valuable camera our possession we enjoyed water rather then leaving it unattended beach	1
this my third canon uw housing . i sold or gave away other two , i moved up sd110 ( 3.2 mp ) s500 ( 5 mp ) now sd550 ( 7.1 mp ) . all my previous cameras still great working order , still used regular basis , both inside housings out ( you see my previous reviews photos those housings elsewhere amazon site ) . i am underwater tour guide hawaii , so i put my housings through more day day abuse than average consumer . mine all held up well . you need religious soaking rinising housing after use . occasionally lube o-ring . not store it heat ( sealed up car hot day , etc . ) , since this likely warp it , cause it leak . other helpful hints i give , : 1 ) get soft carry pouch it , help ward off scrapes nicks plastic housing ( i use coleman stove pouch ) while transporting it . 2 ) not put camera housing while you your air conditioned hotel room . wait put it , until you outside . this minimize chances condensation forming inside housing it warms up . this housing little better than other two , there shade lcd back , which makes it little easier see bright conditions while it housing you wearing mask . my only complaint this housing lack thumb rest my right thumb . other housings one . but this one cannot , due it small size . since lcd much bigger than other models i used , it means all controls shoved way over one side back panel , leaving you little room hold onto it . since i typically wear gloves water , i , few occasions , knocked camera out one shooting mode into . not real big deal , it never cost me photo , but you need look display sure you right mode . just minor complaint , i understand why , since camera so small lcd very large size camera . overall great product price , especially if you like able take nice quality uw photos while your snorkel/dive vacations	1
most part it good product . taking pics darker places seems minor challenge due othe different features . also , when zoomed , pictures taken sometimes not clear you would like them	1
simply pu t--t ake three pictures side side camera stitches them together make wonderful panoramic shot ... no computer even needed . three snaps shot ! camera excellent kodak colors 7mp detail . camera also nice zoom take super wide shots its 23mm lens -- no need back up across room get everyone shot . but it simple panoramic feature make this camera unique . wonderful scenery , etc . wide angle lens , it no wonder real estate agents snapping these up ...	1
this actually 1500mah battery opposed original en-el3 which " just " 1400 .. so very slight increase . this new battery released d70s , but it work d70 . check out kenrockwell[dot]com verify . nikon doesn't list mah specs this battery their website	1
very nice piece equipment . great taking self portraits . i very prompt delivery . thanks amazon !	1
figi underwater camera out ranks many others due fact after going through beefed up security scans when developed it bright color clarity . others turn dark	1
if you reluctant invest $$$ ' real ' underwater camera , this fine temporary solution . i realize it not rated go beyond 17 feet but i took two them 90 feet no problems whatsoever - all seals held i could wind film just fine . only slight critizism pictures come out more blue compared kodak max ( which i used same dive site year earlier ) . but hey , if you're going way beyond manufacturers specs , you're not really allowed complain ... snorkeling ( down 30 feet ) , pictures come out real nice	1
this charger fully charge blm-1 lithium battery 2 hours ( or less if it partially discharged ) . there red light indicates it charging ; it turns green when battery fully charged . it very dependable small unit , so you store it camera bag minimum space required .	1
camera one best considering price size it . only problem i found it not light , so you need buy external one , if not all shots you night very dark	1
this camcorder few months now it put lot use . compact , light , easy carry around . tons features which takes getting use since most it touch screen . battery life pretty good . video quality excellent well . very happy purchase , i no problems so far	1
i love this camcorder ! it fantastic low light , good lighting too . i torn this new hidef camcorders out right now chose this one mainly because low light ability . i not disappointed all . there numerous manual controls tweak any shooting condition . almost all separate buttons dedicated perform then individual functions . it balances very well , while it heavier than small cameras it really not feel way after short time using it . i would buy this again	1
leica lens great bonus my decision add camera . i love size . my other panasonic/leica camera took several falls long trip never stopped performing . it discontinued , so it now held together duct tape . this dmc-fx07 wonderful replacement.ps . i bought cell phone belt case leather magnetic closure perfect camera case . ($[ ... ]	1
i absolutely love this camera . i my research before purchacing what i found held true . flash only issue . it not strong enough take far away shots . this camera exactly what i wanted though , small lightweight camera takes excellent pictures i carry it almost anywhere	1
sony great job again . it could bit better low light conditions , but ' back light ' option it works well .	1
sony dcr hc32 one sleekest cameras it price . however , i find little touchscreen tad difficult use without stylus ( wonder why sony couldn't include one ) . if you stubby fingers like me , it takes while get used tiny menu buttons . inevitably , screen gets covered thumbprints . i started using top-eraser small pencil . sony also notorious not providing larger optical zoom , even its high-end camcorders . fact , this camcorder fares better than some more expensive sony mini-dv . though 20x probably okay casual use , it would help some more . lastly , aware package extra battery docking station not worth much . i irked find battery only charged while its loaded onto camcorder ( which then set dock or take ac power directly ) . this stupid feature means you cannot charge battery while simultaneously recording off second one , basically defeating purpose extra battery . i would recommend considering canon zr600 which cheaper , more optical zoom widescreen recording capabilities . it almost small , but i think it still lacks external battery charger	1
camera great point shoot users . it very easy use ( although camcorder menu bit tricky ) very decent images . software provided not great .	1
following camcorder first camcorder i ever owned . i purchase it because i am interested taking home movies keepsake . purpose , this digital camera work perfect anyone , however , if you keep your expectations too high , you probably disappointed . many people complaned motor noise camera this line , if you purchase zr 800 , you use external mike high quality possible , avoid this background noise . if you like me , wanted higher offered pixel ratio , then you get zr 850 , which lacks external mike possibility preventing noise . noise , i might add , appears me little more than suddle white noise background , which easily filtered out most video editing software . when recording sd card ( plus 850 ) , movies shot rather low resolution appear bit blurry me . part this could videos i shot this way consisted lot close ups . this camera not seem designed doing much lines close ups . night vision very good job pitch black . small led front camera adds extra light . unfortunately this only light you get , since any high powered light isn't available attach this camcoder . led doesn't add very much light , any low light area , picture resolution severly hindered , but still seeable considering how dark it . still pictures look decent , but obvious static you would easily not see any modern digital camera very evident , so definately don't purchase this digital camera replacement . battery lasts 45 minutes , guide suggestions you buy larger batteries increase life . since i kept my expectations so high , i expected resolution little better camcorder general . it decent enough , so sound . i just expected more than i should small handheld camera . camera feels great though , it easy carry , easy use . you run pretty much no risk getting your fingers way view finder . it very comfortable easy use . very little instruction needed figure out just everything you it . my biggest beef this product , which really nothing product itself , it didn't come firewire cable or capturing software . this means you can't transfer stuff your compuer out box . rather , you need get firewire cable ( presuming you firewire port ) up $35 price best buy . you probably should order cable camera . capturing software available canon website , just requiring you register your product . after trying several programs , roxio seemed work best me trying capture video . capturing video breeze , although more software than camcorder itself . besides , its good product , it comes remote control if you happen filming yourself , av cables so you put image television . not best market , but pretty decent camcorder , especially discounted price .	1
wonderful pictures . prints great pictures .	1

purchased this unit new $160 . good performance - little practice , getting readings well over 800 yards , even bright sunlight . also like fact it uses standard aaa cells . housing design leaves bit desired - it bulky , battery cover not very secure . see losing cover easily . not ergonomic more recent models . overall , $160 rangefinder genuine 800 yard performance , good deal	1
this camera case stylish , compact fun ! aware there not much extra space inside store camera cards , definetely not room extra batteries . there plenty larger camera cases purpose ; this camera case stepping out style	1
only used it once so far it worked great	1

i similar issue reviewer ... my z740 lcd screen failed few months ago . i turn camera all screen shows solid white . little eye-piece viewfinder still displays fine , pictures videos still come out fine , but i can't use lcd screen my viewfinder any more ... which one biggest reasons i bought camera ... others online this problem , but i can't find anyone who gotten it resolved . my camera well out warranty , so i no hope kodak fixing it . otherwise though , it great camera ... very impressive actually . i just wish it hadn't died after year half occasional use ... : -	1
i bought this camera last summer . i taken enough pictures put up review now . i love this camera ! pure simple , it met exceeded my expectations . pictures it takes very nice , sharp , focused , crisp . it so many features you play around . i probably only used half them more than once . it very nice lcd display , or you take pictures through traditional peep hole . view screen it always tell you , which mode you , gives you nice centering square , what picture you , etc . zoom it awesome , although i haven't used much date . you take close up shots flowers , insects , etc ., it still get everything just right . three my favorite features though : option take video clips , fact you shoot photographs black white or sepia color , which gives your pictures real antique or historical feel depending what you going . it even let play around shooting night picturs , or different landscapes near far . when you print out pictures off your computer , if you any kind decent printer you almost shocked how detailed crisp picture . i would almost swear it better than film pictures . i couldn't stop looking it , because i so amazed ! person like me mainly takes normal snapshots most time , i don't know what else i could ask camera ! moreover , you can't go wrong price . it little more expensive than other cameras ? sure ! however , features it it well worth it . it isn't exorbinent begin . way , you people like shop around best price like me , i went 3-4 different stores my area cameras like this one , best price i found here amazon . if you buy it , you love it , end story .	1

great little bag carrying not only digital camera printer but room camera , extra film , memory , etc . bag well constructed easily carried via shoulder strap . lots pockets come handy . also very stylish . great value	1
we bought this digital camcorder just under year ago very happy it ... up until last week . lcd screen just quit working . no mishandling or anything . we still record using viewfinder , but who wants when one main reasons we bought this model lcd screen recording viewing . issue comes up when screen quits working playback mode , you must utilize play/rw/ff controls ( record mode entire control menu unaccessable well ) touching screen . when screen doesn't work , this issue . you still use these controls if you flip screen over shut it back into camera ( screen facing out ) then guess where buttons would ... challenging because they're upside-down now , backwards . sony apparently only 90-day warranty , so we now requird pay $136.74 labor get lcd screen repaired . thank goodness it quit working less than year after we bought it new , because first year least parts free !? we realize things don't last forever , but when one buys $600+ video camera reputable name like sony , you expect it work least year . if not , things made right no charge you . very disappointing . buyer beware	-1
this one best camcorders market today i would definitely recommend it anyone planning buy mini-dv camcorderpositive factors : - very small easy hold one hand . easily attached even mini-tripod ease . - excellent widescreen video hi-fi audio . your videos finally get " hollywood " feel when you shoot movies 16:9 ratio ( widescreen format ) . even if you don't widescreen tv currently , you very soon one more more people buying them . so its better buy this camcorder shoot 16:9 format enjoy your movies later widescreen format . - includes widescreen rotatable lcd so what you see what you get when you shoot 16:9 ratio ( widescreen format)- good battery life . one extra battery enough . you easily manage day worth shooting two batteries before recharging them again- includes docking station making it easier connect computer or tv . if you good computer firewire port , please buy firewire cable connect camcorder your computer . you download your movie excellent clarity . avi format edit it required- make sure change audio setting 16 bit ( instead default 12 bit ) very good hi-fi audio- touchscreen menu system great . you don't search any buttons they all available touchscreen menu itself . - 12x optical zoom more than sufficient ordinary home videos . anything more produces more " shaking " would necessiate use tripod . when you shoot without tripod , 12x best zoom you achieve without worrying shaky videos- 1 mp widescreen still photo . you use this feature if you forgot bring your digital camera . photo clarity not good so please don't expect great shots . since photo 16:9 format , you take panoramic photos cover more people group shots- nightshot : cool feature records using infrared light . useful shooting night you record video even 100% darkness- color widescreen viewfinder - very useful when you running down batteries need use viewfinder . color widescreen viewfinder gives excellent picture good lcd claritynegative factors : - outdoor videos especially bright sunlight overexposed . so please adjust white balance when shooting outdoors . add white-balance menu your shortcuts so you easily access it return default once you start shooting indoors- sensitive microphone may pick up button clicks ( best turn off button click " beep " sound ) . notes : - use fresh cassette after recording 2 or 3 times same cassette . head tends get dirty if you re-record same cassette more than 3 times- you edit movies windowx xp using windows movie maker , but beware it not support 16:9 ratio video . hence your videos look ugly you shot them 16:9 but movie maker converted it 4:3 . invest pinnacle software version 9 or 10 better movie editing capabilities . pinnacle only software , i am aware , preserves teh 16:9 ratio . even roxio could not allow 16:9 format . - you also invest wide-angle lens it gives excellent coverage	1
this binocular simply fell into my hand though it made me personally . love first feel ? yes ! i compared this binocular several others same price range , here what i found : fit finish : nikon easily equal any vixen or pentax or olympus ( i didn't try canon ) . feel : nikon far best . optics : nikon something clever here . first all , they gave this one wider field view than , example , pentax pcf . looking through pentax ( , way , i high regard pentax * love * their papilio series , but binocular different purpose ) after using nikon , view seemed dimmer claustrophobic . nikon , you wonderful feeling actually " out there " field or sky your object . everything so bright sharp ! nikon really excels sharpness center . however , nikon clever thing ( i checked couple pairs these nikon binos see if this true generally , it ): this price point you can't possibly whole field view perfectly sharp . no binocular perfectly sharp edges . here what nikon , best i tell : they put sloppiest edges outside top field view . wow ! think it : if you compromise somewhere , you want compromise away center bottom . why ? because , inside edge fov each barrel where object . , most likely ( especially terrestrial viewing ) , object or its environment also resting or near bottom ( think bird tree or animal ground ) so , nikon seems made sure bottoms inside edge fov sharp possible , while allowing far outside top edges little worse . smart ! there some chromatic abberation , but , too , unavoidable this price . even some very high priced camera lenses ( only one barrel worry ) this . ca not all objectionable . little rim faint purple edges fov high contrast situations . very nice binocular . not too heavy , not too big , very comfortable use , excellent imagery , top-of-the-line sharpness-at-center , great construction . i expect get lifetime enjoyment out them .	1
i like this camera . size great , it cool carry around wow factor . screen huge camera this size . i love it ! navigating menus graphically pleasing . pics ok , flash works decently . i one nagging problem : video . ( note : i've only taken indoor video . outdoor , daytime video may not problem . ) if you get right lighting adjust settings just right , you get good looking video this type camera . my problem , it rare everything so perfect . when you look around room without camera , you see things normally . when you look same room same lighting through camera , it almost completely dark . you put " low light " setting all time . problem this setting blurry , so you move camera around very very slowly not get headache watching video . ( manual suggests you only use this setting tri-pod . ha ! this only way see anything indoors ! ) bottom line : i constantly adjust settings camera before i take video order get decent viewable quality . exacerbating problem video lights two lcd lights , they absolutely useless . they flashlight " pointing " effect rather than flooding effect . so if you use it , center your view lit circle fading dark towards edges screen . even such poor performance , lights still too bright ppl look camera while it . speaking completely useless , don't even bother using image stabilization . it makes video extremely blurry ... unusably blurry . they should rename feature " image messer-upper " . said all , i really like this camera . i've focused video because it probably one thing bothers me this camera . everything else great . even though i've harped video , it possible get decent quality video once you adjust settings . it just nags me bit it not easier . i shouldn't turn low light setting all time , setting shouldn't make things so blurry . then again , i bought this camera $200 aiptek website got $100 worth accessories free . so i try remind myself i buy low-end pocket-sized camcorder . that probably most important thing remember . if you buy this multi-function camcorder what it , you get great product . if you want $1000 high-end camcorder size small digital camera , you're not going get it $200 . update : ( 16 mar 07 ) i finally got chance use this camera outside sunny day . video excellent ! beautiful ! i am so much more pleased this camera now i know , least normal daylight settings , i get great looking video . no " low light " setting necessary . no blurriness all ! i even played it back my tv , it still looks great !	1

i using this camera 2 months , taking it cruise well filming couple college choir concerts . all went well , exceeded my expectations , based other reviews i read . only problem i seen lowlight indoor filming , however fix i came across supposedly works , but i not chance try it yet ( see fix end review ) . 20gb drive plentry me , cpaturing several hours hd quality film , still plenty drive space remaining . i very few problems software , ones i more around lack manual , but figured out thru trial error . overall , i would highly recommend this product anyone interested new camera . plus you stop buying tapes . lowlight fix ( note i not take credit this , found it web but not remember where ) . here text exactly i found it , including comments end . how i get good low-light/indoors video ( following steps indoors camera capture mode ): 1 ) disable " gain up " feature ( major contributor grainy low-light video ) 2 ) turn " manual " mode ( via auto button ) 3 ) go manual control menu ( down ' stick ' ) 4 ) set ae ' +2 ' 5 ) highlight ' mwb ' wb menu , point camera sheet paper ( position camera so sheet paper fills view camera ) press hold middle ' stick ' until ' mwb ' stops blinking ( 5-10 seconds ) . 6 ) set . sp . 1/60 7 ) press down ' stick ' exit manual control menu after doing this , my indoors video quality much better ( no more noise/grainy video ) . settings saved , even if battery removed or depleted ; they return even if you switch auto mode then back manual .	1
i got this wide angle lens my sony dcr-hc96 . it fit great ( it says , it 30mm ) . i've wide angle lenses past which created distortion corners frame - that not case this lens far i see . i'm happy picture quality . if you intend film indoors , my advice definitely get wide angle lens . $30 it well worth it .	1
i only use few times , but price it great job	1
this great lens . sharp tack . big but not heavy . it kodak , says it all .	1
i am pleased purchase wide angle lens my kodak dx-7590 digital camera . but ! i am disappointment lens not used cameras built-in flash it , produces shadow . kodak not offer external flash dx7590	1
when you buy product designed meant fulfill certain needs , just expect best performance out those features . pc55 camera everyday home shooter , easy use made best sony quality one smallest mini dv camera ever created . if you thinking buying this camera don't hesitate one minute , this camcorder one kind , it gives you pretty much flexibility video quality regular camcorder but amazing bring-it-in-the-pocket size all coolness attention it brings ( let it your best ice breaker , believe me it works like heaven ! ) . i work camera store let me tell you : we haven't received one return this model during time i've worked there ( 8 months ) , which proves high quality sony built into this model . i using mine few months now all i say " product great ... period ! " . let get real , 500 bucks you paying it not film quality kind movie you get picture ( you need spend least couple thousand dollars ) but portability worriless no need big luggage camcorder used past " ( some times people don't realize motorcycle couldn't compared truck or vise versa ) . picture shooting option , well let see ! camcorder videos digital camera photos , if you want them both one package , brings excellent quality , you'd spend lot more money than if you bought them separately , let me explain you few words , average photo quality mini dv camcorder 1.3 mp or lower ( same quality you get out your cell phone camera ) honest you , manufacturers add this option just give it extra feature same time take more money out your pocket , tape less digital cameras it happens same way , video sound quality very poor ; so why bother paying more camera both functions excellent ( there quite few out market now , starting around $1200 models similar size ) instead buy two little cameras , one each use , half price . if you looking cool , high quality durability mini dv camcorder smallest size available its kind , sony dcr-pc55 your best option . finish , i just want wish you all enjoy , more than product , unmemorable moments you live your loved ones because this little fellow	1
if you want capture every precious moments , this right camcorder you . it easy operate video crisp clear . sound pretty good well . you also take still picture video same time ( thanks memory stick ) . don't burn your video using your computer , it took me time download cd or dvd . instead burn them you watch them . it quicker way . you love it first time you use it	1

hii bought this camera after powershot a80 , which unfortunatley got stolen . i loved th powershot a80 , this camera , younger successor a80 also good camera . it fast , good picture quality , battery life great it really good camera if you new getting into phtoography want learn little more shutter speed aperture . one my only gripes it doesn't seem great low light . it always moans me taking potentially unsteady shot when light low , i don't remember a80 ever fussy . but i think it down cramming 7 mp into same sensor size 4 mp a80 , so each pixel becomes smaller , therefore less sensitive light . i taken some really great photos this camera , would only replace it moving up digital slr , however i would still use it everyday carry around camera . it metal frame construction makes it quite robust too . i dropped it many occasions , once solid stone floor , 6 feet , aside little dent casing , it worked fine . i recommend it	1
love it . it several months now yet find something wrong it . if you've owned digital camera before , there absolutely no learning curve what so ever . just follow your guts you'll find function you want . but all frequently used ones right there your finger tips . i personally love custom timer function allows you set delay up 30 " take up 10 pictures ! you never go back forth ... use energizer e2 lithium batteries you'll wondering if you camera your hands it becomes soooo light	1
case great , but someone else mentioned there no strap . big draw back when carrying camera	1
its great camera dsc-w7 other this series since it small stylish . besides it doent " sony " writen it , just cyber-shot logo . it also small secon pocket storage adicional batteries memory sticks . my only complain this second pocket not big enough keep also my a/v usb cables	1
my twins both rec'd these cameras . they take camera them school trips or vacation . they even took pictures their own bday parties . plug camera into computer play great borders . twins so much fun them .	1
it good case extra battery very usefull trips or events	1
very nice camera case , battery added bonus . all half price battery would cost . now my camera safe home i'll never run out power my adventures ....!!	1

i several digital cameras this tops them all !!!! everything they say it , true . i love not even think batteries , i didn't believe what people said battery life , i just happy i didn't need think batteries , but i just got married my 13 year old daughter took more than 100 pictures this camera her pictures almost good photographer i hired yes camera battery lasted all day thru next 4 days our honeymoon 200 pictures taken , no low battery light !!!!! i even going buy my parents one . also , one more note i love how fast you take pictures , no wait 4 seconds shots . i kodak digital before only 1 1/2 years old hated it , i hated download procedure , it didn't put your pictures onto your hard drive , but it own little cubbyhole trying attach them your email absolutely nightmare , you'd identify picture copy it your desktop , remember what you called it then attach it your email . this main reason why i purchased this camera . i never own anything else , especially kodak .	1
my husband purchased this camera me my birthday last year . his aunt uncle one we thought it simply amazing . since our purchase , we've help several our friends family members buy same camera through amazon . actually , we've bought 4 other ones besides one my husband bought me my birthday . i highly recommend this camera everyone . it small , many neat features , quality pictures best i've ever seen any digital camera . don't just take my word it , buy one see yourself . it very affordable . ( best feature	1
i love just everything this camera . it nice small , it easy use , it takes nice photos . but , i haven't figured out yet how get good night photos , ' though , i've used " best shots " ( feature camera ) . i've it 3 months am still learning it . but , all all , i love this little camera . price right , it what you want it if you get camera sun shield , any camera store ( $19.00 ) , you'll glad you	1
i love : how quick responsive it . how tiny it ( without " i lost it again " tiny ) . i'm surprised it sub $200 , seems like camera worth much more than tha t.t he photos it takes gorgeous . video it takes surprising good quality . battery lasts quite impressively long time , recharges quickly . screen gorgeous . menu navigation easy . only downsides :( this minor ) focusing takes tiny bit getting used . it'll shoot without you focusing properly if you get trigger happy . it feels bit fragile - like ipod ( although i've already dropped it it survived fine ) so you'll want decent case it	1
good product , like price . this much less expensive than current pinseeker 1500 models , i bought it ebay used $150 so you may able find it less ( look under hunting golf rangefinders this model ) . this not pinseeker feature newer models but normal mode scan mode work perfectly ranging flags no reflectors ( although you may need try more than one time relatively stable hands ) . i able range flag 270 yards , able range top telephone pole 375 yards ( but it windy so flag straight out little cloudy ) . i would estimate this work ranging flags calm sunny day ( these don't work well sunny day because laser used visible light laser gets little interference sunlight ) 215-230 yards flag ( which what i need it ) . less expensive alternative than pinseeker , i really like performance , very impressed .	1
this product rugged forgiving . accurate +/- 1 ft ., this absolute must all serious bowhunters . lightweight easy use , i find only one minor design flaw . it designed right-handed use slightly cumbersome those who choose use it left-handed hunters ( i am ) . even this minor design flaw , i still am very satisfied this unit would not hesitate recommend it others . most encounters under 50 yards ease use accuracy critical elements hunt . i harvested nice elk this year 52 yards using this unit . thanks bushnell	1

lacross charger using these batteries . these batteries blow away both rayovac 15 minute 2000mah energizer 2500mah batteries . i baby monitor chews up batteries these batteries last over 3 hours one charge . energizer rayovac last hour most . i using them 2 months non stop rotation seen no performance degregation . also my digital camera , i leave these there weeks , shoot many shots they still going . others i can't leave them there they simply loose power quickly . cannot say enough good things these batteries . i would highly reccomend them anyone make sure bundle it la crosse charger	1
i deal major brand cameras panasonic cameras my personal favorite ! i've seen people whine " noise " they make many times but never found it problem . i own fz10 fx01 my personal cameras . fx01 very fast camera takes great pics ! i love 28mm wide lens . compared most cameras i've used fx01 real good job metering light exposing images . i love panasonic solid build reliability . they may not popular canon or sony but my opinion every bit good .	1
good product but color not so attracticed	1
truly amazing little camera . i looking something small i could stick my pocket when i go out everyday but still took sharp pictures . this camera all more . its small solid still manages take gorgeous photos very nice videos . i highly recommend this camera anyone looking easy use very portable camera	1
canon all way ! i've s230 , sd300 , sd400 , sd630 . i really not like feel sd630 very much after living it while . i also didn't like button placements .. not comfortable it . it take great pics video . but , i moved sd1000 ( black ) , it one week love it ! all canon point-and-shoot digitals , this my favorite . it tiny so pocketable . pleasure use . switches buttons where they should feel good . screen 2.5 so people who want 3.0 need go sd750 which basically sd630 replacement digic iii processor . same form factor . if you liked sd200 , sd300 , sd400 , sd450 or sd600 , you love this ! my only reservation how great pics this little camera . i'm sure they excellent but jury out how good they compared earlier canons . i like vivid pics so i may set camera vivid . got good deal amazon	1
i got this camera use digital photo class . it wonderful . there wasn't anything confused me when i first got it , it took great pictures . software little tricky because it moved all my photos different place gave me very little access , but easily taken care uninstalling software using usb cable itself . 10x zoom great , but if you move all your picture quite blurry . i would get tripod use when you it zoomed really far . overall it great camera takes great pictures good video	1
very easy use , using it over two years now . great quality pics easy print , command , choose options quickly . also take fast photos so you not miss any moments . also like video mode shot blips when i forget or not want carry camcorder	1
i shopped around online quite while before i settled this tripod . i narrowed it down this one slik u9000 . all other things equal ( what i could tell ) , i chose this one aesthetics . i not chance use it yet , but it looks very sturdy , not cheap all ( cheap relative thing , i'm not professional , so me it fine ) . i'm glad i bought it . it well worth price	1
like other reviewer - i checked out tripods camera store . hadn't heard velbon , but quick internet search showed them recognized name tripods . i needed tripod my nikon d50 ( especially 70-300mm zoom lens ) , perhaps video camera , df-60 fit bill - lightweight , quick set up , leveling bubble , detachable baseplate , etc . sure , it pretty much all plastic , but if you take care your equipment - shouldn't make much difference non-professional use . it stable enough built-in leg brace spreader . price camera store almost $70 - amazon beat them mile . received it few days . so far - everything i though it would . highly recommended if you need lighweight tripod . now i need get bag so i sling it over my shoulder	1
i got this lens d50 package . it not pro-lens any stretch imagination , but it works well 99% situations . only limiting factor i found f4- 5.6 range . some situations ( mostly indoor ) you forced use flash . however , we talking dimly lit rooms this point . i've some indoor action sport shooting this lens - gym lit fluorescent lights this lens no problem delivering quality pictures without use flash . ( crisp sharp images , correct colors , no distortion ) focusing not issue	1
beginner or avid photographer this really lens buy . clarity picture quite nice weighs no more than 18-55mm lens comes camera . i am very pleased performance this product would highly recommend it others . i not noticed grainy pictures like some others said plastic focus , you would never think twice it . great lens ! thanks nikon making product reasonable yet high quality ! works great my d50 .	1
adapter great . no issues , shipment received very quick time-frame . lens blocks flash canon g6 , but other than , pictures turned out great ! it all i hoping	1
it pretty neat case . fits nicely . but it only accomodate camera maybe extra cf card . if you want carry spare battery , battery charger , usb cable , etc , then this case definately not yo	1
i bought this camera six months ago my 12 year old daughter . it her ( ours ) first digital camera . i read so many reviews prior selecting this model . reviews this camera so helpful . this camera so easy use it takes excellent pictures . rechargeable batteries definitely must ! this camera best camera this price , no doubt it . we taken still shots videos . it so fun option take video . we some great clips . all i say we so happy camera . we would definitely choose it again	1
cute , compact , easy use - these just few ways describe canon cool a400 ! this stylish digital camera lightweight perfect snapping shots go . mine sunset gold . plus , there perks like macro mode ( which lets you snap sharp pictures close 2 inches ) , lots shooting modes ( like snow fireworks ) . movie mode lets you capture video clips sound . this camera takes great , crisp photos . it easy use , great value . just what you would expect canon	1
case great , easy use camera fits it well . it nice option put belt thru it extra little case hold batteries/extra memory cards nice too . would recommend it anyone	1
good all around works well ; however , external case gotta go . sony should made case fit battery memory sticks inside	1
all tamrac products it inexpensive well made . this 5th tamrac bag i bought various cameras i . first one i bought still holding up almost 10 years later .	1
tamrac makes great camera case , this one no exception . sturdy well-made . it advertized right fit my fujifilm s-9000 , but it actually bit too small this camera . time i got camera pushed , surrounding pouches squeezed so tight little else would go . i should gone bigger case	1
i've this digital camera almost year . it fourth camera i've owned . i spent quite some time searching compact camera i could carry everywhere . amateur photographer ( mostly taking pictures myself not others ) , i didn't want lug around extra bag just my camera . it fits discreetly your pocket or small purse ( formal nights out ) . size weight this camera its best feature , this carries through newer generations this camera , too . this perfect camera everything selling items on-line landscape scenery . my pictures always turned out beautifully , wonderful color crispness . i discovered " automatic " lighting feature not always most ideal , but you re-program just anything this camera . it really quite good camera , given its price these days newer generations out there , it steal	1
it everything i expected , works great amazon partner service very goo	1
my grandparents one love it . its very easy work . takes great pics . its also easy share your pics tv . they love it i love it .	1
i am accustomed using larger point shoot zoom . this sleek pocket sized point shoot gives exceptionally sharp pictures . it focuses very swiftly i would suppose due leica lense . battery life good . i notice photos tend calibrate little blue range . i like little more zoom . overall , i like it very much	1
i enjoy this camera i carry it my pocket wherever i go . it takes great pictures videos . only problem i it hard turn off big fingers	1
this camera pretty fast small enough kept your pocket used if photo opportunity occurs . it also offers wide screen modes taking videos ( 704x384 ) addition excellent standard resolution ( 640x480 ) . my one concern it looked like all pictures i took blurry review screen back camera ; after i take shot , image appears few seconds review then goes back capture mode- all review shots looked out focus . i uploaded images my computer they looked fine . i also went back camera put it play mode they also looked great- so i think scaling review image ( 7.2 mp t0 230k ) after taking picture blame this ; ( perhaps ) fixed future firmware update . all all , this great camera . i keep it me much possible it given me some awesome pictures .	1
pros : compact , lightweight , portability , easy use , big screen , good reproductioncons : microphone sensitive wind , getting used not viewfinder , bad low light performance . summary : i picked this camera upgrade my old canon zr10 . first reason i chose it small size portability . good light conditions , this little beast its best shots , but low light conditions this camera disapointed me ( specially compared mi old zr10 ) . please don't buy it if you plans use it stills shots because it low resolution . included handycam station all ports ( firewire , usb , power , video ) you need conect it . big touch screen must , because screen only way access camera controls ( besides some them edge screen ) . you camera more characteristics better image quality same price , but if your concern size portability this your best choice world mini dv format	1
i can't really belive quality this product until i manage make print out my hp 8050 . i may need upload picture . if you plan buy one camera around $100.00 i belive this would right choice .	1
i bought gs180 prior my trip china . i also bought 4 hour after-market battery ; i've since bought one . that what you'll need if you touring all day using lcd screen all time . battery , viewfinder becomes just useless since it doesn't tilt up . review says camera doesn't come lens cap ; mine . i've remote my sony digial 8 but only used it few times . this camera haves some options only available through remote , though , such audio dubing variable speed search . it aftermarket accessory , picture quality very good . stills taken sunlight also very good ; however , they subpar low light situations . contrels fairly self-explantory . outdoor stills very acceptalbe ; you produce them while shooting video which nice when you see something you kow make good still . large sd card , you shoot 1000 these . i opportunity shoot lion dance just fied way , clicking constanlty , getting great sitills while capturing video . i only havea couple functions i need learn manual ; cmaaera fairly straagiht foward . joystick works great moving around tapes you recorded ( i avoid doing one i am working so i don't mess up time code ) . it really beats membrane control panel my old digital 8 which beginning fail . size camer makes it easy carry put ito your carryn computer bag plane . i shot 15 hours tape three weeks . only times i diappointed when battery died before end long tour day no break return hotel recharging . extra batery bought beijing , i am prepared further excusions . this great camera easy use produces good quality pictures	1
i just recently purchased this camera , haven't chance use it professionally yet . i use it shoot school event my daughter . i shot two cameras picture quality fx1 beautiful(actually too good edit other camera shots ) . i definitely buying second one soon !! only serious videographer this camera would overkill someone looking shoot home videos .	1
every great camera needs great editing software . i am sure most people already know , but all apple editing programs support hdv format this camera natively , without need purchase any additional video cards . this true apple final cut pro hd , final cut express hd even imovie hd ! high definition video this camera edited even ibook new imovie hd right out box . this what i call truely amazing	1
i shopped around while before i bought this camera . i checked out many reviews i say , i'm very happy this camera . i wanted something worked low light . this most important feature i looking . i canon video camera , i now very few videos my daughter growing up because if there wasn't enough light it would make interference tape . this camera works very well normal indoor lighting . you don't turn extra lights . ( it also nightvision which works very low light ) only complaints i 1 ) battery doesn't last more than hour - but i don't video long anyway 2 ) memory stick doesn't hold many pictures - but i'm spoiled my digital camera holding lots . general , i would highly recommend this camera . you download video you pc really easily burn it dvd . oh , some reviews it mentions zoom hard use . i don't find true all . it sensitive , but not hard use .	1
dcr-hc90 fantastic little camcorder performs well all types settings . it might best consumer camcorder recording low/dim light . more information , photos clips , visit my website :( ...	1
i too purchased this camera online . i believe camera itself took quality photos , but upon lense no longer telescoping . i contacted repair line only find out they quoted me $150 repair ! i could not locate my receipt , even though i purchased it new online registered it , they would only say , " no receipt , no warranty " . valuable lesson learned . keep receipt ... nice camera	1
i use camera taking pics our commercial web site photos very good . easy work , light weight , auto-focus works well . manual settings easy figure out too . you don't need install software many computers : just insert card into slot there might already software included pc . also don't need docking station if you media drive . i haven't problems excessive battery consumption nor sudden shutting off . i think many camera brands pulled back quality control favor mass production . if camera fails quickly , you return it . i olympus ( which i loved ) die after couple years repair costs would much new camera . it not just kodak . sure , get extra memory card use .	1
this camera lot fun . it not just snapshots ; many pictures distorted through fisheye lens artistic pictures	1
long time photo nut , holidays , my wife bought me fish eye , gold no less . i shot fujicolor 400 , took pictures my car all kinds crazy angles , streets , people , all shot awarness viewfinder just aid . took film into one hour developer , following instructions , no prints , just negatives put them cd , he , got them home viewed them . they wonderful , little work them picasa 2 converted some black white , it seems like artwork . today queens ny , floyd bennet naval air station , concord taken off deck intrepid now view public , am taking lomo me , should fascinating . my only negative fisheye film advance bit raggedy , but really works fine . i love this camer	1
i've owned powershot g5 better than three years now , while i've never used any lens accessories , i couldn't happier it . i also eos a2 it met all my needs film camera . i thought i would giving up lot when i got g5 go digital , but so far , i haven't disappointed . fact , i've surprised how good g5 ; since i bought my g5 i haven't even once picked up my a2 , let alone actually used it . g5 everything i need it . one only drawback it compared my a2 it took me little while get used longer latency shots ; my a2 i got used lighting fast latency ( a2 built powerwinder goes 6 fps ) so it bit adjustment , but i'm not sports photographer , so i've learned live it . my next camera also canon digital , but i'm going make sure get one that got good latency shots replicates powerwind my a2	1
very nice . attractive stylish . fits purse , very compact . good clasp , well made good leather . places spare chips . not one thing i disappointed . not disappointed any thing case . you pleased this product	1
i nikon user nearly ten years . my first nikon used n70 i loved it . it wasn't until after i read review i learned it supposed confusing , somewhat difficult master , not quite up nikon standards . i loved results loved my nikon camera . when n70 needed repairs cost prohibitive , i purchased its replacement , nikon n80 which all likelihood my last film camera ( i've just purchased nikon d70s ) . n80 best features n70 : automatic mode programs portrait , landscape , night shots , action shots , close up , settings allow manual focus ability set specific apertures shutter speeds , bracketing , red eye reduction . it more features than n60 , but works similar manner omitting some dials n70 seemed confuse many people who used earlier nikon models . it light weight camera excellent . features easy too master it allows person take sophisticated creative photographs . it also sturdy i hope use it many years come . my guess some people reading this review may asking should i invest $300 film camera when i could also purchase digital slr camera just bit more . digital wave future future now , there no question , i mentioned i own digital camera . i believe film camera teaches person more careful photographer . i see lot people take lousy digital shots figuring they erased miss great shots . while it true digital results seen , screen awfully small until images downloaded viewed eth computer , what appears great shot may fact junk . film cameras teach photographer carefully frame photograph if no other reason than film costs money . photography also supposed fun , seeing results film whether it prints or slides fun . also even though photoshop create black white portrait digital shot , nothing ever beat darkroom experience . most serious amateurs professionals i know use both digital film i'm assuming foreseeable future i'll using digital candid shots film scenics , landscapes , nature shots . if you serious taking good photographs looking film camera , nikon n80 excellent choice . it reasonably priced what it offers , easy use , allows opportunity take great photographs . me , it well worth investment .	1
serious student photographer who worked old metal bodied all manual slrs i thought transition automatic camera would difficult . too many cameras market made cheap , lightweight plastic feels like it going crumble my hands . i like camera weight it , but won't require visit chiropractor after day shooting . n80 great this . it very solid construction , comfortable , weighted feel my hands . grips both sides well sized well placed i feel i optimal control all times . thing sold me this camera over similar models its ease use . someone who never wants read instruction manaul , but still wants use bells whistles , this great camera . controls most intuitive i've seen any camera its kind , whether you're your way becoming professional , or you're just starting out , combination versatility ease use perfect . it extemely self explanatory change automatic/program mode , aperture priority , shutter priority . its also easy use timer multiple exposure controls . bracketing , similarly easier . i've camera ofr 6 months enver needed consult instruction book , hopwever there many features i explore book if i so choose . focusing same you get most cameras this price range . focus lock works very well , zones . ; problem focusing low light conditions , but this typical these cameras . overall , i've found this camera perfect blend great price , great variety accessories , utter ease use , bells whistles serious student or amateur or aspiring professional	1
nikon d200 amazing camera . this review amazon packing procedures . this review alert prospective buyers amazon not pack these cameras well . i just purchased one it came packed like book , very little padding . i called nikon their recommendation return item pronto . i returned camera ( much trepidation)and purchase trusted source . just wanted give you all heads up	1
i think point lot people not mentioning d200 quite obvious . let me first say main reason i bought d200 over d80 increase my credibility prestige amateur photographer , make other photographers jealous my kit , brag obscene amount money i spend camera equipment while my co-workers can't even pay their rent . i bought grip because i thought it looked really cool , it increased size visibility my camera other people . question really sold me d200 : strangers i might want photograph more likely say yes standing other side d80 or d200 ? people less doubts me holding this thing opposed smaller model ? which one looks cooler ? if i completely loaded would i buy d2xs ? without second thought . course i talked lot camera people making minimum wage hoping they would some technical insight purchasing nikon or other camera . course they let me down said lot bogus things me most saying something like : " d200 way much camera me . " none them knew how change exposure settings , they contented wheel " child mode , " top d80 recited this me several times if i looked like soccer mom . usual i offended human experience buying real world , especially atrocious mark up several hundred dollars , i refused help pay those employees wages . breaking point i think time associate instructed me buy one camera over other because , " when she dropped this camera it broke other one didn't . " so i turned internet where i only say hi ups man he leaves . i studied studied all things technical , sometimes just staring pictures cameras long periods time without blinking . i poured over thousands photographs taken all kinds cameras amassed photographic library while i decided . basically i went way overboard let decision buying camera engulf my life until i dreaming it . so one night i just bought d200 after fence over d80 or d200 . after two days it arrived i impressed it . thing literally cold hard photographic machine . after broken d50 i firstly impressed size , then secondly all dials switches change things i used dig through menu get . thirdly i liked blazing fast 2 frame rate . when i go out night i snap 50mm f/ 1.8 onto it crank iso up . lot people forms complaining noise high iso d200 but i thought it fine . i feel most people camp want perfect clarity all way up into highest isos but i think artistically limiting . i read one scathing review written veteran film user saying basically high iso digital lot less graininess than film basically saying d200 step up but some people still want complain . far d200 goes versus d50 iso 1600 it leaps bounds better my opinion . noise way reduced without nr there isn't pixel chunkiness i found d50 high isos . thing stands out d200 enhanced colors . reality ultra vivid setting d200 makes lot things look sort fake , but it make people who don't sun tan look like they one which plus my opinion . it make your dull green lawn look like lush paradise , skies ultra blue , reds spectacular . i remember when i used d50 i would steer away photographing violets red roses because it would blow them out , not so d200 . some reason coming point shoot it always used annoy my d50 didn't bw or sepia . d200 bw but no sepia . nerds forums would just say , " use cs2 , or photo editor , " but i say no because i should able everything camera . viewfinder so awesome . i literally hated electronic viewfinders d50 viewfinder so small it hindered my framing times . d200 big bright viewfinder huge lcd sucks down batteries like nothing . far my evolution goes photography sometimes i feel like i literally climb into viewfinder because its so big compared what i used . like i said grip awesome i really like it . i kind like many accessories possible kind steered me away d2xs into d200 . watching percentage marks count down batteries drain always fun . best thing d200 little things like because they make me feel like i greater control over my pictures because i know exactly how many i take . conclusion buy d200 over d80 i am really happy it i am not happy anything . if you're trouble considering what you want photographically try pull yourself away forums outside sources really consider what got you into photography first place where you intend go it , i think important part . advertising gear collecting never made anyone better artist	1
all three items worth , package represents good value - but these three don't always play well together . obviously , digital camera , it always pays spare battery keep you shooting when other goes flat . leather case also worthwhile well-made , providing impact scratch protection , particularly important keeping lcd screen good shape . oddly , cut-out case flap isn't really large enough metal strap pass easily through . thr strap rather stiff while it forced through , rectangular juncture near its end just too large . but leaving it inside case flap against end camera virtually guarantees it'll grinding away camera finish while transit . truthfully , metal strap looks great , works well ultra petite digital elph models , but extra weight s-series mean strap begin biting into your neck over time .	1
after opening box charging battery , i it shooting without cracking user manual . easy use confidence-inspiring . menu system mostly self explanatory , only changes i made put it xp ( highest ) quality mode , 4:3 instead widescreen aspect ratio , disable digital zoom . most options you'd want there . this tiny device , size my 4-yr old 3x zoom digital still point shoot . such , screen size little small , particularly if you shooting 4x3 instead widescreen . case mostly plastic but feels solid nonetheless . sure attach included grip extender tripod socket . this crucial one-handed operation zoom . i like use thumbnails identify each clip . so you delete unwanted clips same way you would delete photos still camera . i pleased image quality . i tested it indoors daylight bulbs fluorescent lights . i didn't see low-light problems some people mentioned , but i wasn't shooting candlelight ... i've heard good things still image shooting so still camera 10x optical zoom nice bonus . i no problem mac connection , just download mpeg streamclip apple $20 mpeg2 plugin , you convert dv format imovie . though some users may find this difficult or annoying .	1
you know what i hate video tapes camcorders ? you never really know where record heads : " if i hit record now , am i taping over something else ? now let see , last time i played back tape , i think i fast forwarded back current record mark ... or i ? ooops , i missed my chance great clip ... again . " hard drive , there no chance recording over older clips . camera always ready record , if battery still charged . yes , battery it comes lasts hour . i never ever my entire life video camera using/owning needed record more than one hour time . when i am not using this camera , it sits camera bag charging off ac adapter . this isnt hard thing , so i dont know why so many people complain battery life . still camera capabilities not too bad really . sure , still pics same resolution first digital camera i ever owned , but i still got some good images ~ 1.3 mp . changing into still camera mode ver easy switch , vs . through gui . i not know cf slot when i bought camera , so very nice bonus me , all our digital cameras use cf well . 30 gigs space nice , but hind sight , better glass lens what this model all when compaired its siblings . i leave video quality highest resolution , occasionaly copy videos my external hdd editing , backups , etc . i got this model video camera because we new baby , i tired putting energy into making sure i wasnt taping over priceless moments . this video camera , fear gone , i am able get capturing our memories	1
great compact battery charger . it relatively fast easy take you when traveling , due it size .	1
found exact replacement charger came camera , shipped me promptly , actually got it quicker than i expected	1
this my 3rd digital camera i bought this one supplement my larger 10x zoom camera . this one fits nicely into pocket or small camera bag easily take it all events or travel . i've found it takes nice photos indoors when flash used .... even when cats or dogs i'm shooting moving around . i've felt life battery set pretty good , but i've using nice rechargeable ones . definitely get set 4 , then you 2 use 2 backup set . settings pretty easy figure out change 99% my photos taken " auto " setting came out pretty good . others indicated , indoors - without flash - produce blurry photos , but that nature almost all cameras , not unique this model . glad i bought it would highly recommend it	1
cute , compact , easy use - these just few ways describe canon cool a400 ! this stylish digital camera lightweight perfect snapping shots go . mine sunset gold . plus , there perks like macro mode ( which lets you snap sharp pictures close 2 inches ) , lots shooting modes ( like snow fireworks ) . movie mode lets you capture video clips sound . this camera takes great , crisp photos . it easy use , great value . just what you would expect canon	1
i've read good reviews this camera this other sites but i am not same experience . quality photos horrible so i started thinking it me i tried it different settings , tried very , very still etc but , i only get one good shot out ten . i fuji 4mp i bought 6 years ago it takes way better pictures than this . i bought this so i could give my old one my daughter but i'm gonna end up giving this one my daughter keeping my fuji . we recently snow here tucson so i took pictures mu fuji compares them canon 6 year old fuji finepix beat it hands down . i don't get it , i get defective camera or am i doing something wrong or this camera just suck	-1
i tried binoculars sent them back . optical quality excellent but distinct cost . binoculars simply bulkier much heavier than other 10x42s i really felt price not justify improved performance . addition , why pay price expensive optics then no good way protect lenses - primary lens covers terribly designed can't stay lenses .	1
this my my 3rd pair binoculars . 1st pair canons they're best i've . better than previous models i've owned . battery consumption much lower . only slight problem flat surface binoculars rest slippery plastic . boat use , bincoulars instantly slide if you put them down . this easily cured gluing non skid material . i would buy these again	1

this very elegant well-made all leather camera case your fuji f30 presumably , f20 . it nice stitching dark chocolate brown / espresso color . i gave it 4 stars because it not quite " slim " it could - it could tad more " form-fitting " imho . contrary other reviewer , it much bulkier than my neosprene case i using but again , its elegance set it apart . second , magnetic enclosure doesn't seem quite " strong " i would like . overall , i'm pleased but just realize it add bulk ! it not come wrist strap	1
