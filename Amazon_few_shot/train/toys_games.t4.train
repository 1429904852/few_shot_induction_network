my son loved this tent . he fit perfectly it it fits inside his crib so he sleep his tent . my only beef it somehow he bent frame it so now it doesn't sit right floor . actually it doesn't sit floor all because where it bent . tent would better made if there floor it some support ( similar what keeps top portion rigid ) base it keep " legs " ( there aren't any but that best way describe them ) apart . tent would also better constructed if it didn't one continuous wire frame each side . if wire gets bent there no getting it back into its original shape , unless you take out stitching ( around whole tent frame ) repair it then restitch it , but who kind time ? overall it fun toy little one but not well thought out build . i'm glad we got it gift it wasn't something we spent our money	-1

this car pictured could base or first version defintely not worth 299.00 these going 100.00 less web . if you havent noticed differences packaging it wouldnt suprise me . lots people dont notice . heres differences below ... these 5 cars there two versions each driver(5 different drivers ) made . first versions or base version second versions or " added features " version . first versions no " added features " stickers you cannot race any two ( or more ) cars 5 different drivers ' cars same time ! dale sr. dale jr. , jeff gordon , jimmie johnson tony stewart cars first versions ( no added features ) cannot race together ! transmitter frequencys cannot changed . speed steering straight function . ( no varilable anything ) they either turn right full turn or left full turn or it goes straight . speed either it goes full or it doesnt . same reverse gear . again , each 5 different drivers ' cars made two different versions same car one more features than other . updated or " added features " versions " added features " stickers . those " added features " ... digital proportional steering ( variable steering ) , which means you turn transmitter wheel slightly car turns little . turn transmitter wheel alot car turns alot . variable speed control this means you pull back trigger little car moves little , pull back trigger all way car takes off ! this also works reverse gears well now if this isnt cool enough ... each " added features " car different frequencies different drivers ' car . transmitters cars different well . " added features " version transmitter two " trim " adjustments back remote well frequency chip side remote than changed , also changed chassis car . so if you own 2 tony stewart cars , you would frequency pack race them same time . now , two or more different drivers ' cars race together ( or five people race 5 different cars ) . no two alike cars race together unless you " frequency car transmitter " change it , or " frequency pack " team up inc . all 5 frequency chips not come car box , off shelf . this " frequency pack " sold seperately ! you also purchase tires , suspension parts body hold down clips , fully painted ready use new spare or other drivers ' teams bodies , extra rechargeable battery packs seperately ! i lots research these cars should you any questions please ask...nascarnbroncosfans@msn.co	-1

teething two molars cold croup-like cough over week made my little toddler ultra-grumpy zapped his energy . poor fella couldn't even play blocks or puzzle without falling pieces frustration . i going buy 100 balls put his baby pool summer , but this whole thing sale less expensive than pack balls . he shuffles around , rolls balls down ramps , dunks them through rings hours . no mental challenge , no frustration , it doesn't zap all his energy . it made same weak plastic 99 cent beach ball made out overnight whole thing visably less inflated -- wish it little more substantial . sides not sturdy sit or used pull-up . 31 inches , he barely get out safely . balls inconsistent -- one thick hard next so thin you squish sides full inch . we're not trusting it last long time under everyday wear tear . our plan store it out way until next rainy day , he sick or worse , if mommy gets sick ! no need air pump . two us huffing puffing we got it inflated under 10 minutes . take note some these ball pits free shipping -- shipping this cost more than sale price	-1
only thing " deluxe " this addition glossy foil cover box , which designed make you think you getting something special paying more money . nothing could further truth . this edition screams " cheap " second lid comes off . let go thru hype above set record straight all " deluxe " features : board quad-fold affair , redesigned presumably allow smaller , less expensive box . it much less rigidity than single-fold board " classic " version . when it left out extended period time , especially overnite , ends board curl up refuses lay flat . houses hotels completely featureless , just small blocks wood . they looked dipped some type vegetable dye rather than painted . this probably attempt eek out few extra cents corporate profit . " bankers tray " " property wheel " flimsy plastic jokes . neither would last under play children much more than few games . this edition sad legacy great game , cheapness set detracts joy play . additional cost , all you really getting fancy foil cover one extra play token , plus board curls up edges : whoopee ! my advice : save extra money buy " classic " version .	-1

i purchased this myself my 7 year old play . screen way too dark able use dusk or after , but if direct sunlight , you can't see it either . it pretty small ( buttons screen ) little confusing . if you person who using hard earned money purchase this , then don't . but if you just want check it out okay not wanting it later or losing money you spent , go it	-1
radica used amke good hand held electronic games ; this cheap . buttons need pressed unusually hard respond . dark screen lights up only when room nearly pitch black	-1
my daughter got this her 5th birthday , it really looks cute fun box . within 5 minutes playing it , small clip holds starfish open broke . addition , mermaids other pieces come this toy microscopic . if your kids like mine , they lose items bug you all day help them find it . this toy really cute , but not worth it . save yourself hassle . buy big barbies pretend there big seashell play	-1
this toy needs work ... first all , it heavy ! my daughter ( now 19 months ) usually likes pick it up throw it . after all , it ball ! we hardwood floors - throwing this ball extremely loud it really some damage our floors ! we don't any problems it moving around ... however ... when you're asked find something ball , even i hard time finding it push button time . so , i don't know how 6 month+ baby/child could find correct answer time . i think this nice idea toy , but it just doesn't work . it colorful , my daughter enjoy throwing it , but that obviously not it intended use . she never played this toy crawling infant . she only plays it now , she only throws it . please don't waste your money this toy . it not worth it	-1
quick shipping product but product not what i hoping . " snow " much grainer than i expected . i seen what i thought same item stores during holiday season " instant snow " very fine really looked like snow . this product doesn't look much like snow doesn't same texture	-1
got this xmas present 2 year old . he loved it , but sounds steam quickly stopped working zero abuse . incredibly cheap toy costing 40 bucks . this just how ruin fan show . folks who design such badly designed stuff should ashamed themselves . my son important deserves toys last more than two days	-1
start button too difficult even three year old hold down . battery tedious re-charge ( required after every use ! ) . dangerous . when child leans slightly side entire engine turn over . all your time money you only see child bored expression - or frustrated child who can't operate start button alone . you could tape down button then child must ask you stop it . total supervision required any way you look it . real expensive , gimicky toy !	-1
it never worked - period . not even second . get disney fish - it doesn't look real but least it works .	-1
i bought this my son fourth birthday because he superhero nut . it cute toy except one critical flaw : it doesn't come anywhere near fitting around waist my average-sized 4-year-old ( wears size 4t ) . i'm talking three inches waist gap even smallest setting . yet belt adjusted size would fit teenager . if you 9-year-old who loves running around batman costume , go it . my 4-year-old , he still plays it sometimes , but we keep it him pair firefighter suspenders . update : thick plastic belt now ripped halfway apart . we've only it two months , he hardly played it abovementioned reasons . not so great batman , but perfect playing super chintzy toy man	-1
all non-yellow parts ducks painted come off pretty easily . little moisture some teeth minute remove paint . this toy best those who past placing toys or anything their mouth . i still think they cute great idea ... just need made better/safer	-1
well , now this carry case goner . latch no longer close top rim hopelessly bent . it fun while it lasted	-1
i see reading below reviews i'm not only one who hates this thing . what total waste ! i got it my little one , remembering how much i ( every other kid i've ever known ) loved this toy . well , this version made too safe any fun . it barely spins . if you want your toddler develop amazing upper body strength , then force them work out this thing couple times day . it almost impossible spin you never get up any momentum all . not mention loud loud music no volume control . which i could deal if thing any fun all	-1
features this toy cute , just not planned out very well . my boys love music bubbles , but micky goofy go up down sides broke off after couple days . voice recorder very hard work because short cord . ride my boyslike radiio flyer retro rocket more . overall , our house this bubble machine .	-1
it lauches marble so forcefully marble bounces off ramp it lauched . instead using it fridgits set , my youngest son used it launch mm ( but that story ) ..	-1
i got this clearance like 2 years ago . i new it would not hold up . i many kids it because i home daycare . my rule only 3 kids time . bigger kids could only go 2 time . it got 3 holes which i patched . they even took naps it . i must it 6 months only keep it up like week time . my problem it hard store . i leave it inflated some pushed it back my closet . finaly one big kid big belly flop it popped seem . no way fixable . if i ever find it clearance again i would buy it but not what they asking it . not worth it if it break couple months	-1
i support comments others make : this game so poorly designed , it laughable . i cannot imagine designers or writers even sat down play game once . forget trying follow directions ; they left out many important rules . board doesn't work , especially way pieces fit into it , what terrible ending spinner doesn't even work like spinner . what up ? forget this game	-1
i'm sure this would fun toy , but us it didn't last long enough find out . we this our pool 5 minutes one guns stopped working . boys very disappointed ! i taking this back store tonight try exchange it new one hopefully works	-1
this very cute set however , it not very well made holders free-standing so when ball knocks against it they fall over . regular croquet wires pushed into ground so you don't problem . kids . . . stands knocked over frequently so you run over set them back up order game continue . i wouldn't buy this set again if i it over . disappointing	-1
this seemed well put together would job fine except it not stated anyware i saw weight zip line . rated only 100 pounds not enough weight limit this child . this information should published advertisment	-1
we like lunchbox because cute designs , but little disappointed it durability . first time i dropped it ground , it scratched off parts design . so , mom some creative thinking some touch up paint sealed design " self laminating sheets " . trick . we also wished thermos lunchbox insulated . other than , it o.k	-1
this new low , even our feminazi-drenched anti-culture . whole message this whore doll tell impressionable little girls superficial , arrogant , shallow slutty positive attributes , desirable healthy , contrast , true strength character , integrity , honor modesty ' losers . ' other words , looking behaving like skank tramp = " empowerment . " term so misued over last 30 years ( particularly last 10 ) , it ceases any truth it whatsoever . barbie used epitomize what it meant feminine , lady , fulfilled -- husband , home children . now standard completely perverted ruined onset dolls like this -- exchanging true values ( good wife mother ) false ones ( materialism promiscuity ) . even barbie face uglified -- grossly overdone mascara/eyeliner collagened-out lips -- resembling those hideous whored-out bratz dolls . realize -- this war our children souls ! mattel should ashamed themselves , hilt . this child abuse , pure simple . any mother who allows their child get one these monstrosities should jailed neglect her tubes tied	-1
ok , i don't this doll , i won't buy this doll ... if i ever little girl she never anything like this . i saw some girls saying how doll appropriate 10-13 i almost fell out my chair ! this doll -in-appropriate someone under 21 ! short skirts short tops . how heck mattel think this good idea ? i'm 23 years old i would never dress like nor would i allow my child dress like . bottom line : shame you mattel !!	-1
toy makes extremely loud animal noises , screeching motor when backing up or top speed going forward . my son enjoyed heck out it 2 minutes before my wife said it going back store , which exactly what i thinking . least 3-4x louder than any other toy i've ever seen , let alone purchased . also when performing its " flip " maneuver , it gets stuck 70% time then makes same screeching motor sound while it repeatedly tries reset its " flip arm " . might okay just outside use if you stand lot high pitched noise . controller extremely toddler friendly compared other rc toys . toy also seemed fairly tough .	-1
i agree first two comments . we went check it out after my 4 year old saw it tv liked it because bear glasses just like him . product seemed decent store , so we bought it . he only played it once or twice since christmas . only time he fun it when i got mad yelled thing because it wouldn't what it supposed . save your money don't buy this junk	-1
just what world needs , clone worst board game ever sell like hotcakes . i not think any reason recommend this game . winner determined luck , there no skill involved winning this or any game monopoly . game hardly fits into single evening play , few unlucky players who exit early means either sitting around watching or finding something else ( this may blessing if it means not playing anymore ) . so anyone who buying this play it ( not because you huge dog fan must own everything dog it ) i recommend you look into better product . i would start going google searching " board game " . follow 1st link you find	-1
i purchased this my sons birthday this year . he three . he so excited play tent but when i took it out box started put it together i noticed stitching not straight missing some places . it took him no more than 24 hours brake it . plastic supports cheap fabric horrible . there also center support pole no place put it . he likes it but quality craftmanship zero .	-1
i bought this christmas present my 4-year-old daughter . she huge my little pony fan . ponyville lives our house fact . we got it out played it couple hours . we didn't problems described hand crank . seems very durable . problem flower zippee goes . pony steps flower open flower then you wind gear counter clockwise close it . after couple hours , flower petals now broken can't repaired . toys certainly don't quality them they used . hasbro quality general declined . this demonstrated newest my little pony castle well . this toy some neat features . crank works well braiding mechanism useful . breezie lives flower goes story my little pony video series . colors vivid bright . i would liked suggest pink stage daffidazey stands should built-in storage hold hair accessories . some additional clips would also nice addition this set . 4 clips set designed all your ponies ' hair bit skimpy . braids nice tight even young child operate this toy .... bit assistance . ( hint : putting suction cups or velcro hook loop bottom makes it even easier little ones play minimal adult assistance )	-1
i bought this product my children because it looked neat ! what they don't tell you paint must diluted before you use it ( why not include pre-diluted paint ? but i digress .... ) . even after thinning paint , product hardly spins . if we could get it work , it seemed like neat concept . but it just doesn't work . i no idea if it because it needs very thin paint or motor weak or what . we returned ours refund	-1
my stepmom bought set these each my three kids ages 12 , 9 , 6 . all i say not buy these !!!! my six year old great first page but other reviewer said film gets all over markers . we even tried washing them off it no good . also when my 6 year old coloring he would rest his arm bottom page when he would pick it up it would covered black . bottom line 30 minutes after they got them my kids arms faces covered black smudges my hands somewhat just holding their pictures look them . messy messy messy . my 12 year old finally just went stuck one papers under running water washed off all black see neon underneath this proved least messy but least rewarding way it . good idea bad execution . my kids who crazy any kind arts crafts hated these things . save your money buy regular papers markers crayons	-1
start , description this kit false . there not 75 pieces ... only 11 . detail very , very poor ... large soft-edged raised blocks only vaguest resemblance death star seen films . you'd honestly better off starting smooth plastic ball making death star scratch , rather than buying this kit .	-1
barbie plug play 12 dancing princesses thing joke . my daughter only wanted christmas three months . after one christmas morning not function all , second one so terrible she gave up after two days . graphics straight 1981 " dancing princesses " even make roboty bendy noises they move . very strange disappointing	-1
santa gave this our daughter this year . i am thoroughly disappointed it . we put batteries started it up . after reading how part , graphics terrible . i prompt her which flower step , not necessary . princesses started dancing without stepping flower , it just made funny sound . dancers go fast fuzzy . you can't tell sure what foot work doing ballroom steps . i even went mat " tried . " my daughter lasted all five minutes . i hope santa take this back	-1

others stated dvd mini-games nearly impossible play due wonky controls . i also no idea what cards or pieces , other then they may come into play if you " win " main game . they should just choose your own adventure type game . it would less high-tech , but you could least laugh when you choose " set up perimeter " terrorists once again escape . not buy	-1

main issue controls . we hard time getting this thing fly well idea pulling down go down weird us pilot types . it tends just nose dive regardless . we give it go park tomorrow but so far all it crash . it still one piece amazing	-1
back day ( 1970 ) these made stiff , strong plastic , rigid " insert " w/ poly-rope outside . this gave " leash " realistic , " tight but curved under own weight " appearance , believable / realistic " bounce " " dog " most imperceptible wrist action part " dog walker " . however , this piece crap thick soft wire inside leash , this gives leash very phony , fake-looking , too-heavy , all bent-up look . piece junk piece junk piece junk !	-1
there many significant shortcomings this interactive dvd game . i not recommend it all . it not all like real feud . most frustrating shortcoming you must get answers right order , since it reveals them order , or you lose . no steals , no strikes . sadly , i can't return it since its dvd game	-1

my wife i purchased videonow xp interactive video system my son this christmas however when we walmart out headphones . well i amazon one day decided look here . i ordered them seriously disappointed when they arrived . my 5 year old son attempted put them all they fall his shoulders . no matter how we tried all they would . my 12 year old daughter decided try them her mp3 player same result ! i am able wear them however even my 30 year old head ( size 8 1/4 ) it still loose . these not adjustable which course makes things all worse . i would just go ahead pick up some other company aftermarket headphones your child . if tiger reads reviews their products all then they need ensure they rethink engineering this device	-1
we looked trash truck our 4 year old boy could play . surface , bruder looked part . not cartoon-looking some , fact it looked like real trash truck but few obvious breakable parts made it seem like ideal choice . actual play testing though shows this product isn't very well-built , least not enough withstand normal wear tear . this truck wasn't subjected thrown down stairs , jumped , etc . it just played , but it started coming apart quickly . hinged door back truck poor design . plastic hinges truck too thin , break easily . plastic hinges door start bend after multiple open/closes , plastic weakens breaks off . hinged front compartment rear sections difficult operate , stick easily . items put into cab ( like essential green army man who drives truck ) easily get caught here very difficult remove . worse though key point this toy , ability latch trash lifting/dumping mechanism . this way complex child , intricacy getting solid connect difficult even adult . if it not hooked up right , falls off when you try lift it ; very frustrating . some little pieces ( rear view mirror , etc ) broke off easily early , but we kind expected this . parts simply too small fragile last long . i don't hold this part against design ; part attraction it looked like real truck , i don't think there easy way add small details without some fragility . while this orignally one my sons favorite toys , he can't really play it way he'd like . while he still enjoys driving it around house , he can't pick up trash dump it without adults help , that shame . price , i expected so much more .	-1
this item looks great theory , but it just isn't worth it . pegs made all different sizes - some fall out , some don't fit , some stick out too far , leaving you messy look your lite art . one crayons neon broken when received , but it didn't matter , since it just looked like regular crayon drawing black paper anyway . if you buy this item , sure purchase 25w light bulb isn't even included	-1
kids got it christmas , it looked like fun . however , one we got doesn't work all . i'm not sure if we just got bad one or if this problem common , but i can't even get it turn without changing batteries , then i can't get it go into game mode . plus , rules electronic version different , you lose all your points if you keep acting out words . i prefer rules old version better . i'm planning return this get old version	-1
we excited first bunch stickers then my 5 year old wanted try it himself . it jammed up end it . there no instructions how fix it so i threw cartridge away . don't waste your money	-1
this paint brush globs out paint , doesn't spread make any kind picture brush barely holds any paint . we went through both provided things paint five minutes no picture show it . not mention bottle small brush fit so when paint half way down you can't get brush it suck paint up . i am so disappointed	-1
we purchased this our daughter after she loved original ballet version so much . i expected same quality original product very disappointed . mat very cheap flimsy my daughter broke headset trying get it her head	-1
these figures look pretty decent first glance but when you take them out box you see how bad they really . my superman broke half ( waist ) when i took him out box ! add fact there only average six points articulation each ( only three wonder woman ! ) you see these aren't very high quality figures . amazo transparent , which makes no sense whatsoever . he isn't invisible character . i also don't like , while superman belt stick out his uniform , bizarro merely painted . only buy this item if you love doomsday its sale . it not worth its list price long shot	-1
we bought this game yesterday our daughter . dolls very difficult her dress . we it her . also , two dresses torn already after playing game only 4 times . she loves game princesses , it teach memory , but it could made much better .	-1

purchased this 3 1/2 year old boy . hesitant buying any large , plastic truck , but we not see any alternatives time we purchased this . we should stuck our instinct . when it arrived , we immediately struck fact plastic seemed flimsy , many small plastic pieces attached grader appeared felt so cheap flimsy we doubted they would survive 5 minutes play , our humble opinion . we not going wait find out , we decided send this back . you get steel tonka 18 " grader off ebay less than what amazon asking this plastic thing . that exactly what we . good luck	-1
my daughter almost 6 we got her this christmas . commercials made it look really cool easy kids , no more scissors ! well we opened it today it too hard her hold button down any amount time move it around slowly enough actually cut anything . i'm it all her my hand gets tired too ! they should made it " pen " cuts when just pushed paper or something . i 9 year old also trying use it it wasn't all easy him either . seems more like something teens or adults scrapbook would use	-1

i just bought this game tried 3 hours make it work 3 different t.v. sets - no luck . i can't even give it 1 star because i don't know how fun it ( or might ) . i tried every " input " available every t.v. , i tried changing batteries , i tried hooking it directly t.v. well thru vcr dvd player - nothing worked . i guess i know why it only cost $5.99 .	-1
don't buy this unless you plan attaching remote your forehead duc t-t ape ; if you lose remote you cannot operate moon . moon also automatic time it comes ; it supposed when it gets dark , but it comes way too early any good , because nobody their room early , it only stays 30 minutes . when it comes itself , ( because its too early ) you barely notice it .	-1

after returning three defective tonka hands power shovels , ( aka crane , ) we decided try different piece machinery brought home dump truck . so far dump truck doing fine . it not exciting crane or digger , but it work seems holding up . my son loves turn it amp ; it quot ; followquot ; him around room . however motor strains , truck moves very slowly , so i'm concerned load too much motor . he likes loading action front end shovel into dump bed , dumping bed . he disappointed it doesn't steer like crane , but only goes either forward or reverse . but working toy better than non-working toy , i'm hopeful this one keeper	-1
i think this doll incredibly fun beautiful , but somehow tail broke off very first day my 4 year old daughter played it . she loves it anyway , she insists . she just screamed pleasure after seeing hair turn purple tattoos appear after 3 minutes freezer . i don't know how it got broken , or how rough my daughter might , but it seems strange it would break so quickly . disappointing	-1
my son loves cars trucks so this looked like it would big hit , but like other reviewers , we put this toy away because all injuries . he used handle push it , but toy unbalanced , so any pressure back causes it flip up hit him face . he several big bruises one cut lip . since posting this , i've spoken rep little tykes . she said they would look into this toy bit more sent replacement toy my son play until he able ( if ever ) use dump truck again . if you've problem this truck , please call them so they get it record	-1

it looks fun picture , but there major design flaw this toy - wheels stick out so far when rider tries go they end up slamming their ankle into tire . within 2 minutes using this toy my son ripped open his ankle . this toy should recalled . not buy it . i would send mine back , but we already thrown out packaging	-1
my daughter got this came christmas it still fun play , but new graphics very confusing hard follow . they want little overboard their updating this one . new colors would fine , but all curves , zig-zags , etc , make this version poor substitute older versions . i'm going ebay !	-1

i bought this carry case my son l-max . it works well carrying unit all games he it . i wouldn't advise dropping it hard surface any sort . it not nearly padded enough carrying hand held gaming unit any sort . my son likes take his l-max school him mornings before school begins . i place it carrying case then place carrying case inside his backpack give it some extra cushioning . if i known how little padding there this particular carrying case i probably wouldn't bought it . there carrying case out nintendo wii similar style but much more padded . i almost purchased it but then thought i should get something designed leapster l-max . if i it over i would purchased case wii . it might little big but extra padding would made up it . overall , it not bad purchase but money you should get something little more protective . after all , leapster starts $69.99 price goes up accordingly l-max	-1
it almost impossible turn times . instead moving one right , you go three left , or fiddle it so it lines up properly . you still solve cube but it gets annoying when it doesn't move way you want it . i hoping it'd better cause it really cool it fits your pocket . it just too hard turn . i ended up breaking thing trying get it turn one way . i cant put it back together cause one pieces missing . i really like this product ( i'm buying one ) , i just wish it wasn't so stiff . maybe they made it stiff so it wouldn't turn your pocket but if you know how it , you finish rubik cube 5 minutes , max , so i don't see need prevent it turning . apparently they thought people would solve like half it finish it latter	-1

don't buy this price increased version . i doesn't work any better than $19.95 model . plus it uses twice amount batteries . concept great , graphics great that end it . this just like first plug play ms pacman ( which i also bought ) joy stick issue . if manufacturer would take off games need twisting action joy stick maybe this would actually fun play instead frustrating . while playing ms pacman which only reason i bought these plug plays ms pacman mind her own , turns corners her own runs into ghosts her own . it impossible use joy stick without twisting it during play then you're out control . it extremely frustrating . popular pacman ms pacman their day still these plug plays would sell merit alone so take off games needing turning action joystick	-1
my 4 year old really wanted this christmas , after looking similar products , we chose this one . should spent money one w/the dvd . tutu way too small - fits her 18 " doll . mat little too sensitive , she tries put her feet position kicks off music pads . only 2 instructions - feet up , feet down . other arms up , arms down . bar isn't very stable . company should save money they spent putting tutu slippers create more helpful mat . my daughter press music button mat then dance off it .	-1

my kids grew up overseas quite familiar renaissance paintings . they've seen many these paintings very familiar them . i realize this not typical situation . i disappointed game basically game luck . it not challenging or reinforcing our kid knowledge . i hoped game like " famous authors " which builds tests level knowledge players . nonetheless , game well presented . it expensive side , but book alone worth half price . looking fancy gift cultural overtones ? i recommend this	1

we enthusiastically played candy land each our three kids . it easily best starting point introducing child board games . players take turns drawing deck moving their pieces around board . cards one or two squares particular color ( such red , green , yellow , etc . ) players move pieces ahead path next matching spot same color . no counting or reading required . there also special cards move player ahead or behind , they indicated picture spot board which player should move their piece . play continues until one player reaches end . some my observations : 1 ) most kids probably start playing enjoying this game before recommended 36 months age . if you child attention span desire sit down 10-15 minute game , i'm pretty confident they could enjoy it . 2 ) among lessons our kids learned candyland : taking turns , recognizing colors , dealing disappointment . luckily , games quick enough it usually possible play multiple games one seting . this makes it possible keep playing until each child least one win . ( very helpful managing little egos)3 ) such simple game , it manages perfectly balance possibility changes fortune without seeming arbitrary . game literally doubt until last card played ( one " special " cards might send player back near start ) . this great teaching most valuable lessons : " never give up " . 4 ) most simple games , it almost impossible get older kids play after they reach certin age . we not found true candy land . we've games adult kids ages 3 , 6 , 9 playing together fun . if you more than one kid , you know how hard this . parent three , i give this game my highest recommendation	1
both girls , ages 4 2 loved this	1

bought this our girls , 2 4 . huge hit , even before batteries put blow dryer . this set great several reasons , i'll try list top few . first , dryer actually little fan it whirrs loudly enough seem real , but not so loud disturb cat when she getting her fur . ( uncommon kid toy ) also , nail polish eyeshadow both made open " use " , but no mess . once you removed inner packing materials , bag large enough headband tiara storage . must today princess . one thing i caution you curling iron . if your child longer hair like my girls , it get tangled when hair " curled " . fortunately , curler no moving parts , so tangles discovered long before any permanent damage . all all , pretty sturdy little set $15 . great practice make-overs such , but probably not experienced princesses , there no actual make-up involved , just imagination . perfect my house ! no glittery door handles or perfumed pets !	1

i so glad when my little sister got this game her birthday ! unfortunaty our version wasn't like version i when i young . some reason people stand didn't open or close very well . so while some you could smack down , others you jiggle wiggle get lay flat . not only but when we would start new game , you're soppose able just flip board over all stands would flip out . well red board they didn't flip so well , fact only few would flip up out help . could my fault when i put pieces together . game still fun , althought it hard teaching my six year old sister not exclaim out loud she glad who she got because she likes her hat . although i didn't problem her picking her person instead doing it randomly , ( like you're soppose too ) i still love this game forever .	1
two grandsons ( 4 years 6 years)have truly enjoyed this cartridge . recommend it highly !	1
i got this game my then nearly 4-year-old daughter year later she still enjoys playing it . game very simple not require reading . all parts pieces high quality . it good opportunity work numbers measuring , plus game goes fast so you play it quickly if needed or multiple rounds if you time/inclination . object create tallest character mixing/matching 5 parts ( feet , legs , body , head , hat ) . character pieces brightly colored fun include : ballerina , doctor , fireman/woman , policeman/woman , cowboy/cowgirl , clown . roll die determines which part you select . die both pictures words -- except wild side which printed red . after characters assembled each player measures included ruler ( you choose centimeters or inches ) see whose character tallest . it sliding ruler base so kids actually fit their character inside line up top corresponding number ruler . i wouldn't recommend this game kids beyond 5 -- it may little too simple . but 3/4/5 it great game	1

we recently played bonkers our game club . we read instructions we hoping going bonkers would fun it . bonkers game based asking players questions . questions not trivia knowledge-based questions , but instead word-based questions . instance , question might ask you " come up words end bell " . during your turn you 30 seconds " go bonkers " trying blurt out answers like : barbell ; dumbbell ; doorbell , cowbell etc . your goal would find many answers possible order hit any or all four answers provided game card . every answer you hit , you win scoring chips . just one category questions called add ons - where you find words begin or end certain word . other categories : what blank - where you find words complete blank ; rhyme time - where you find many rhymes possible order match those provided game card ; letter perfect - where you would find words which begin or end certain letters . game play interesting because there some strategy thrown . beginning round , one player ( card reader ) peeks question answers game card decides how many scoring chips each answer worth . so , example above , card reader might allocate 5 scoring chips answer cowbell , four chips barbell , three chips dumbell two chips doorbell . this placing chips gameboard under target answer " " ; " " , " " or " " . object card reader decide which answers hardest place most scoring chips hardest answer . this because if players not hit some or any answers provided game card , card reader win scoring chips leftover advance board . however , if players hit all or any answers game card , they win scoring chips correct answers provided . i really like strategy part game , it adds good deal spice . bonkers provided entertaining evening . we play again !	1

i bought my seven ten year old daughters moon shoes christmas . i read all reviews , so i immediately instructed girls always wear their bicycle helmets when playing their moon shoes . yes , they dangerous , but few precautions , i think kids more fun , safer , parents peace mind . 1 . don't let kids start jumping right away , hold their hand or them put their hand your shoulder they practice walking them . 2 . once they've achieved ability balance , them practice bouncing place just little bit . this help them learn balance they move learn how moon shoes respond way they move . 3 . set ground rules , no bouncing when there lot debris around , no bouncing while holding objects , always wear helmet , no bouncing near each other , if you feel or hear any rubber bands break while bouncing sit down immediately take off shoes . my kids spent first half hour/45 minutes getting use their moon shoes . they now bounce around stability confidence	1

this well thought game . game where players play dvd gatemaster gives you commands , rewards , or punishiments while they playing game . players also watch rules setup instructions dvd . six keys six different types laid out some spaces , your goal get one each type rush center before 49 minutes up . if neither player wins 49 minutes , gate master defeated you . beginning you write down your fears reveal them end which always fun . board six territories . each character owns territory which set same keys . you pick up key landing key space , card telling you , gate master telling you , or winning duel . duel when you land battle space 2 players wager key dice roll see who gets both . there two types cards ... time fate . land skull head get fate card which allows you something certain situation . time card you get if you land clock . time card allows you something if you play it exact second it tells you . sometimes gate master give you power banish someone . when there reward , there also punisment . if you land cursed key , you pick it up whenever you it , you cannot win . if you landed into black hole , you cannot participate until you freed . also , you lose keys . during game gate master says " stop !

i got this yesterday my daughters ( 3 6 years old ) , they like it very much ... let see how long lasts . space kind cramped , but both them fit there few dolls , so i wouldn't complain . setting it up pretty easy , although it almost no stability ( it gets toppled every couple minutes or so ) , doesn't seem take away fun it . however , there couple surprises me : ) product i got very different picture advertisement . it still shaped like castle disney princesses all , but it just different . i am not complaining , my girls like it lot . ) i said before , setting it up fairly easy ( just keep your face away you take it out box , it spring out you very fast ) , but , trying disassemble it putting it away completely different story . , you remove 4 rods ( which not so easy insert first place ) , then , you fold thing away twisting it way only experienced snake handlers would expected able so ( i don't care how easy it should according instructions ) . i tried it 20 minutes until i gave up . , if you don't keep box this thing came , just forget storing it folded , it would like trying keep " jack box " compressed without " box " . think it . so , if you don't mind adding this permanent decor your house , go it , your girls probably like it .	1

we bought my son couple starfighters , tri-fighter , at-rt , wheel bike . he loves starfighters likes at-rt little . he rarely plays wheel bike . i think starfighters just simpler , sturdier , easier play . wheel bike ( smaller extent at-rt ) more complicated , thus less fun 5-year old . we run around mock dog-fights starfighters , but poor old general grievous sits toy box . overall , probably good older kids who more expertly manipulate legs other stuff , but not all fun younger guys	1

this pony proved ( princess promenade ) one most popular my little pony we bought . it comes pink skirt , pink crown high heel shoes . most popular item dressing table revolving mirror after several months it still hasn't broken despite harsh treatemnt . pony white silver strands through mane tail . it very pretty but rough treatment really make mane matted very quickly . also , think getting white pony very seriously younger children , while coloured ones drawn pen stains wiped off least partly concealed - white ponys it impossible hide . younger ones ( 3 year olds ) it hard get them not first . desert rose very pretty but now bit stained sorry looking . never less she integral my children games still which nice . one more popular ponies we bought . generally very hard wearing , including accessories , only item which broken crown which didn't last - it too thin got badly bent early	1

i purchased this expansion set , thomas friends water towr figure 8 set , my 2 year old this past christmas . expansion set afterthought , prompted no small part manufacturer promotion running time ( 50% off this set purchase figure 8 set ) . conclusion many initial hours intense playtesting ( ongoing process , no termination sight ) , my son agrees this essential choice any but most basic ( read : boring ) wooden railroad layout . this expansion pack comes switch tracks , allows little train engineers ( their dads ) reverse directions or explore different parts railway . retrospect , i think i would dissatisfied i not purchased this set complement basic figure 8 layout , promotional price or not . far quality , learning curve wooden track made hardwood , more substantial than many other brands compatible track ( i.e. maxim , first learning , etc . ) . this consideration when your child insists taking track apart him/herself put away . we already broken couple pieces generic track this way , since male end connectors bit weaker than rest track . overall , we quite satisfied this set , look forward many more hours enjoyment	1
we bought this set my seven year old boy we bit dissapointed . there better magic kits out there price older children .

i started playing this game it original german version . which , went through some revision expansion decks put out . result , english version may end up little more together you get expansion decks . talk wonderful game play two people ! it absolutely well put together , though certainly different playing than boardgame version catan . it uses same notions , but far more dynamic involvement within game play itself . expansion packs absolutely great , overall add lots options twists play game . it takes couple hours , signicant amount table space . it travels well enough it box , but actually play it you need time lots space . i highly recommend it , especially if you only two people looking game you play fun , involving , certainly full strategy . this one many wonderful games made klaus teuber , i hope he keeps coming up winners	1
i stumbled upon this game years ago , my family enjoyed it -- even my adult friends , who seemed balk first playing kids ' game . this past year , i decided purchase it my sixth grade classroom . i must say ... wow . i allowed kids play it while during homeroom , kids would waiting early outside room get snag frog juice . they would even play it over other outdoor games recess . anytime you heard " noooo !

chaturanga oldest known form chess . it dates back india seventh century a.d. front porch classics carefully re-created this game it now available everyone ! game itself beautiful . it played fabric playing board ( all games once played fabric , it extremely portable cheap , cardboard wasn't even invented until late 1800's!) . unlike chess , game played two four players . each player gets 8 playing pieces , made clay : raja , elephant , horse ( cavalry ) , ship four infantrymen . these pieces kept beautiful velvet bags . each piece loose equivalent modern chess . raja most important piece , much like king . elephant acts much like rook . ship bishop , you cannot capture raja ship . cavalry moves exactly like knight . infantry , which this game look kind like tiny buddhas lotus position , like pawns . big difference chaturanga chess chaturanga played four-sided die ( it long rectangle , instead perfectly square cube ) . die tells you which piece you move . game somewhat easier learn than chess , but easily much fun . game should used teachers parents introduce their children history culture india . rulebook includes lots interesting information india well history game . game comes convenient bookshelf edition , where game kept beautiful book-shaped box looks great any bookshelf or coffee table	1
this first game i've tried venerable reiner knizia . i really taken combination simple rules , but interesting strategy . since then , i've purchased several his games . those who like lost cities , but also soft spot poker , try battleline . samurai great introduction sometimes complicated world " tile games " , tigres euphrates much more complicated cousin ( although again , rules aren't complicated ... difficulty comes via strategic decision making . ) so far , my all time favorite knizia game ... frankly , one my favorite games period , modern art . game mechanics fairly simple , easily explained 5 minutes , some more complex bidding rules explained trial game . essentially , it game playing auction ... who best playing market , guessing art values , spending money wisely . it also true crossover game ... non-gamers , or those only exposed standard monopoly , trivial pursuit , etc , quickly learn how much fun it ... probably asking play again	1

this without doubt best [ ... ] we spent toy our 7-year-old son , but it isn't toy . it highly functional , albeit inexpensive , metal detector . we've it now 3 years take it camping , etc . it easily find something small rusty staple , detect railroad spike far 4 1/4 inches down , very good if you consider how small detection coil . when camping kids love find dig up ancient tent stakes , rusty nails , occasional coin . adjusting sensitivity trivial , just hold it away any metal , turn sensitivity knob until red detector led just goes out . other reviewer noted three-piece shaft breaks easily , which happened ours , but little duct tape goes long way this shouldn't stop you buying one . if you get one , make sure bury some coins other treasures garden kids find . ps it also really works great locating studs plumbing pipes walls	1

i went online look other little tikes toys handle saw this truck - which my 17-month old son loves - only two stars i wondered why . i disagree most other reviews . handle top makes it easy him push around carry - he run it up slopes , ground , anywhere . he never fallen or injured himself it . fact his frustration occurs because he only pull dump truck end up 50% time . usually he just hands it me , points he wants it open . i agree handle make it difficult put large items back opening end dump truck makes it difficult items fall out . this only reason i'm not giving this toy five stars . but my son loves this truck pretty much playing it constantly since we got it month ago . i'm planning get him train handle because he likes this toy so much .	1

why people purchase toy tikes when it specifically targeted older kids beyond me . always look box minimum age toy best . said , all ltto taggers , including this one , simple " grab go " game called ltag . all you pull trigger twice you're your way . this early manual , way before all complicated games frustrate 6 year olds their parents . i love ltto . i even run club uses it here auburn , wa . but i * always * start new players out ltag , then move up hosted games , then more complicated games . never try start out hosting team hide seek game , ' cus it just too much young or completely new player . but that why ltag game exists ! just grab it play ! no messing control panel . don't take low rating based inapproprate purchase worth much . similarly , take my rating grain salt since i'm huge fan . but kids 8 up adults , ltto taggers wonderful , durable , long lived toy gets you moving thinking	1

if you know movies inside out , this game fun dedicated fan . i play my son knows so much more star wars trivia than i but find game enjoyable . only minor annoyance when you land pie question too many times , dvd portion game runs out questions tells you use question card deck . not sure why they could not load up more questions dvd but maybe game not intended poor old mom answers so many questions wrong	1

if you hardcore family guy fan like me ( i am actually one few people watched family guy when it originally air ) , you not disappointed this monopoly version . box beautifully designed griffin family pictured center , some easter eggs look around . board not most impressive one especially compared simpson muppets monopoly versions but it pretty nice griffins center . what you love board properties , which include everything chris ' closet seamus ' lighthouse james woods high geronimo palace clam channel 5 news mayor west mansion finally petoria , all both old new seasons plus some scenes stewie untold story movie . property deeds somewhat disappointing though . not color watermarks like those found simpson version , but i guess they . peter fishing boat , hinden-peter , peter-copter pope mobile replace railroads . i bet you not laughing too much when you pay $200.00 ( income tax ) volcano insurance or $75.00 workplace sensitivity training ( luxury tax ) but hey , you can't stay mad long salesman guy , right ? it would cool joe swanson go jail space picture quahog prison jail space but well , what you ? pewter tokens nice . you chose tv junkie peter , mug hand brian , nose picking chris , lois , stewie high chair meg ( who looks like peanut character ) . you also order four more tokens include giant chicken , quagmire , joe evil monkey . coolest changes chance community chest cards replaced what deuce ! giggity ! giggity ! giggity ! cards , respectively . they beautifully full color you find things like ; made sheriff bumblescum advance go , get liposuction implants pay $100 , confederate civil war veterans after you go back 3 spaces , take big fat paulie movies favor collect $25.00 , help death get girlfriend collect $100 , many more . money goes follows $1 - meg , $5 - chris $10 - lois , $20 - brian , $50 - stewie , $100 - peter , $500 - griffins there no special rules this version , which weird since it norm some time these special monopoly versions . wrap it up i must say even though they could better job this beautiful wonderfully monopoly game . family guy fans love it making this great gift . fun	1

i loved electronic talking battleship kid 1980 anxious recently play this game again . i always excited looking through back play booklet when picking out board . i also always nervous when opposing player would hit red button , firing their missile . you hope they'll miss but you'll get bit nervous once they manage hit one your ships . you also hope they won't sink all your ships before you figure out where their ships . other hand , when you're one pressing red button , you're eager hear crashing sound - hitting one your opponent ships . good feature this game you play someone or you play against computer . when someone plays against computer , one usually loses . but i recall kid beating computer few times so that not case here . all , electronic talking battleship worth money bring many hours entertainment . great investment ! - donna di giacom	1
my 9 year old son just started understand this game , we bought it when he 7 . he would get confused how call out other persons ships . he would say where his ships . this game helps kids understand they need pay attention coordinate where their ships . it depends how quick your kids pick things up if they would enjoy playing this game .	1
sorry excellent game working my first second grade boys well my sixth grade girls . boys practice counting reading while everyone lessons sportsmanship . excellent choice	1
concept more or less same standard monopoly . product good worth price . its nice family members sit toghther njoy	1
what makes this monopoly version special large tokens difeerent styles houses hotels . i love how they made tokens bigger heavier . also four different styles houses hotels little variety housing . money holder felt it make it little more fancy then standard plastic course case metal instead standard cardboard box . other than it same game . only complaint i i thought looking tin shelf it silver gld colored tin , but it only siver . gold only plastic around tin .	1
my 6-year old daughter her friend got one these christmas . they love it !!! it tons learning games 5 levels each game . i can't tell you how much this helped her reading writing skills . once you complete level , you get " prize picture " . i've looking all over expansion cards because she noticed they slot them . i no luck . i would highly recommend this product	1
i know alot impressionist already . so getting this game just add my collection . i actually impressed i learned something new . writing explanations pretty simple , because it geared towards children , but i still enjoyed it .	1
i bought this my 5 year old son who loves draw . crayons cheap , compared crayola . we tested 10 different reds searching correct " spiderman " red , but they all looked too pink , pretty much same color . also really waxy . oil crayons terrible , totally waxy - no oil all . markers ok ( so far ) , but why provide two each color same thin tip ? they could given broad thin tip marker each color instead . case seem pretty sturdy , so worst case i'll replace contents better quality art supplies . i'm going look around something better ... if i find it , this going back toys us . any ideas ?	-1
my daughter received this christmas when she 20 months . she loves it !!!!!! it perfect size her she now tall 2 year old . it conveniently one piece very durable . easy clean . you need buy some food pots pans it not come any . highly recommend any little tot	1
i bought this gift my daughter 2nd birthday . she really loves this kitchen . abby reese spends hours hours cooking up storm this fridge . she so imaginitive - i love how it teaches her pretend play . this kitchen very compact - fits almost anywhere . i'd recommend this kitchen anyone	1
my 11 month old son received this christmas . he loves it , goes it more than all other toys he got christmas . easy little fingers , entertaining , great practicing fine motor -- pounding , pushing , turning . little tykes really hit mark this one ! much better than kitchen my daughter	1
this first real toy we bought my son ( other than real baby toys ) , he 6 months time . moment we brought it home , he loved it ! it comes three balls you drop slot they come rolling out - he never got into part even this day but he loved loves hitting different parts workbench hammer hearing sounds seeing lights flash . it also winding crank some other great little features kids love . now he 20 months although it no longer one main toys he plays i see him go over give it whirl here there i still see same excitment his eyes just like first time . i don't know if i'll ever able get rid this toy not because my son so attached but because i am attached memories his very first toy would hate see it go	1
shopping puzzles over last few years i've noticed manufacture age recommendations seem bit off . when puzzles too advanced , simple solution put it up later date ; however , when they too simple , they're waste money . unfortunately , alphabet art puzzle one those disappointments . puzzle encourages thinking , matching , but i'm not sure it helped teach alphabet . addition , some images too goofy this age group . instance , piece rope shaped into letter " , " but 3-year old don't associate such thing . example this , letter " " yarn . wouldn't yo yo better solution ? raised pieces offer new motor challenge plastic knobs , but they too shallow board . i can't seem move this puzzle without dropping several pieces floor . my son found this frustrating well . what more , i think age recommendation needs adjusted . i purchased alphabet art puzzle when my son 2-years 4-months old . it recommended children 3-years up , so i thought it would make good choice . it didn't challenge him all . second time he worked it , he completed it less than 4-minutes himself . said , my son benefited puzzle . he likes working it , continues ask questions pictures . i recommend it children 18-months up , they find it more challenging than 3-year old .	1
this puzzle one best we found age 18m - 3.5 yrs . it now used our second child great condition , very sturdy wooden pieces . it fabulous learning all sorts things - alphabet , hand coordination , new words , you use it play i spy well . it visually appealing well	1
play game itself great -- similar scattergories you'll coming up words fit certain category looking them start certain letters alphabet , but several twists make it even more entertaining . one beef i really this game deck available categories too small -- just two or three games you'll begin repeat categories . so , you may wish augment deck categories your own	1
i purchased this game 5 years ago searching more because all my family friends wanted their own copies ! we familiar fundex toys ( phase 10 ) wanted family game ages 6-86 could play together this game ! rules easy , game never same , everyone fun	1
my daughter loved color pencils sketch pad comes this set . crayons , however , not survive shipping , those broke shortly afterwards first use my seven-year-old . overall , lovely kit , but crayons not well crafted rest kit .	1
grandchild loved this gift . her her friends made tattoos everyone . there so many styles choose they really lasted . would buy again minute .	1
i agree previous review you get what you pay . but future i would highly recommend paying more once instead replace this food few months or so . we received this gift outside it looked like great choice ! i very happy . but we this package food one week i am already taping boxes packaging tape keep them together . little hands pull apart milk , juice snack boxes no time . cans food so small they topple over easily play kitchen . pies , pizza , such food all actually hollow underneath . there no base them . they tell you 101 pieces but our kit it counted 8 hotdogs ( without buns ) , 12 individual french fries same potato chips . not necessary especially since you also get two french fry packets french fry container you get hot dog bun separately . why would my child want four jalepenos too . so much this food not they type thing small child would familiar . anyway , my opinion spend money smaller quantity higher quality food or go online find " vintage " fisher price or little tikes food . now those made last good size small hands .	-1
my daughter 2 1/2 when i gave this her . i use it teach her food groups encourage her taste real version . pretend " invisible " food fun , but little one who lot learn different foods , touch see worth 1000 words !	1
i bought this kitchen my daughter her 2nd birthday . she didn't seem very interested first i just figured it would take time her like it . i showed her how play it how sounds work but she still very uninterested . i think she needs little bit older fully enjoy it . she plays it long someone there playing her . she can't reach top shelf yet gets upset everytime something placed up there . tell you truth my 4 year old sone loves it . he loves pretend cook things clean dishes . this kitchen withstood my daughter climbing all over it , my husband falling it my son standing it . it tough toy ! i love it so small ... it doesn't take up whole room like most other kitchens i love it moved easily . i would recommend this toy anyone who shopping 3 year old or older . i am sure my daughter enjoy it more once she little bit older	1
i purchased this kitchen my daughter christmas . it arrived i started assemble it only find few minor manufacturer defects one pieces compramised way it assembled way it would " wear " over time . i called little tikes ' customer service phone number after explaining problem they said they would send me new part immediately . i haven't received it just yet but they said they would try get it here before christmas . i dissappointed when i found defect certain , one week remaining before christmas , i would difficulty getting someone respond my request help . i spoke nicest man little tikes so impressed how company stood behind it product sent needed part absolutely no hassle ! they didn't require me prove part defective or even return it them ..... they simply took my word it . i am impressed , more than ever , little tikes company appreciates their customers ...... even it they aren't making " large " purchases . this not one their most expensive kitchens yet they still stood behind quality their product !! i'll try update this review once i've recieved new part entire transaction complete .	1
we 2 these toys - they both same problem others - only says " red pan in/out " if you slam it hard floor it occasionally sing , but this also random . fisher-price rep. not seem surprised when i called report this - told me keep toy i sent me voucher new toy .	-1
my seven month old thinks pots pans best thing ever , i'd definitely rather he bang plastic ones than real ones . but i say songs little irritating i find them running through my head when i'm trying sleep	1
reading all reviews different toys it still come down individual child .. my little man got it christmas 8.5 mths .. he like it .. he takes them apart . shakes pot balls it .. he also loves just pressing button .. makes it talk .. overall not bad price ..	1
we got this my daughter 3rd birthday it such hit ! we no issues chalkboard thankfully . it really simple assemble very sturdy . she able use this item many years come !	1
my daughter received this her third birthday . she loves it . i would agree insert chalkboard not work so well . dry erase , however wonderful ! i cannot wait get paper so she start painting next ! i would recommend this three above . there some small pieces height could pose issue smaller children . but overall , great product ! only downfall , they not provide even few sheets paper get you started chalk/eraser etc .	1
we bought this our 10 year old grandson last christmas he loved it . he interested animals he wrote book ' dangerous ' animals . he great time doing it . finished product great . his parents copy book printed seller sent it us gift . we always cherish it	1
great idea ! bound book sweet , not cheesy all , nice quality . makes great gift grandparents . my teenagers even enjoyed making them .	1
my three year old grips these perfectly . array colors make them such enticing reason try learn write . great set markers . really really great	1
very interesting spoof original game . i found first one boring after few plays , but this one still interests my kids i after 10+ plays . it bit convoluted put it together initially , but well worth it	1
this extremely fun addictive game . you shuffle cards , place three ( room , weapon , person ) secret envelope . every room you go into , you make accusations . if someone card you accused ( like room ) , then they show it you you write it down your notepad . game changes constantly , so it never gets boring . character pieces teeny details , like mr. green straps buckles his briefcase . i gave it 4 stars education because it teaches you focus really think . oh , good problem-solving skills too . coordination ( you add all clues up see who it ) . all all , terrific game . great rainy days or playdates . i mention weapons ? very realistic . cute	1
i bought this game long time ago but unfortunately all my friends busy until x'mas . there 5 us once we started playing , we all addicted ! i heard some other friends commented clue boring game , but we all found it fun challenging ! apart strict logic thinking , keys win ask right question make good , well organised notes ! last time we played we 5 players , so some us got 4 cards hand some got only 3 hands . bit unfair because players 4 cards more clues beginning so their chances winning higher . so we tried one game open 3 cards table , game finished lot more quickly . but we all found it less challenging . overall , great game !! train you brain logic thinking much sudoku mastermind	1
my daughter received loving doll house christmas loved it , however our family consist mommy , daddy , girl , boy golden retriever . when i spotted this item i so happy see i could duplicat my daughters real life family . she absolutly loved it . she actually played just dogs accessories 3 days . it hard find stores so i just ordered it amazon/toysrus . it out stock so she not get it until after christmas , but ok she said " more presents " when it came mail	1
varry good board game . i played it first time over weekend . game we like strippopoly 5 stars them bot	1
first time i played this game my co-workers happy hourand then again my family members our summer vacation thebeach house . although we already close " thought " we knew lot eachother-this game only made us closer . i don't remember laughing hardas i once secrets started become revealed . next morning atbreakfast , no one could even make eye contact without laughing ! this game perfect play group friends or family willkeep you laughing all way thru ! it would make perfect holidaygift-i highly recommend purchasing this game if you up somelaughs !	1
i bought this my 2yr old grandson his birthday so he could motorcycle like his grandma . he loved it ! wheels wide enough keep it tipping it light enough just right size throw car take . he make his own " motor noise " , but that plus my book . no batteries replace or noises annoy ! also his very tall 3 1/2 year old brother ride it comfortably , so i look it last long time	1
this little motorcycle cute . however , it very lightweight similar quality ride-on toy could purchased much less any discount retailer . stickers seem high quality date , none peeled off . extreme shipping price added $10 $19.99 price tag . this definately not $30 toy .	1
idog very cute , but he takes long time get going sucks batteries down record time . too bad , because he nice way play your music .	1
i've trying get some sort way listen my i-pod without earbuds . i not going spend $100 bucks boom box just i-pods . so it caught my attention while i herbergers noticed i could listen music through dog . it cute so i grabbed it . you put two aa batteries dog leg . then you just plug your i-pod instant music . sound isn't good stereo system which makes this good me since i live condo not want make lot noise . dog cute its head turns its ears go up down beat music . there also lights go off beat music too . it also cries barks . kinda gets annoying after awhile . it demands attention . if you pull its tail it growls . you control songs volume through your i-pod . this cute cheap way listen your i-pod without spending lot money or lot hassle .	1
shuttle bay door fall off no time . booster rockets next . ability stand it up launch pad last few days best . robot arm cheap garbage . this my experience 4 year old boy , but it applies all ages	-1
this more costume item adult or older child than toy young child . there only two working buttons , one open visor one repeats single message through crackly speaker . there some padding top , but not enough . manufacturer acknowleges this including note suggesting more padding added . overall not good value all price .	-1
my twin boys ( 16 months ) love this toy . i would suggest getting least 100 extra balls . ( i 250 our ball pit it really looks fun )) connections aren't best , but they work better than other company models don't velcro straps . our kids play this off most day . cautionary note , this fairly large system tunnels tents so make sure you plenty room . course , you use pieces separately make several smaller play spaces instead one large area . overall , i am glad i purchased this i didn't wait until recommended 3 year old age range .	1
what bunch junk ! upon opening megaland , i noticed it ripped seam one area . this pretty large rip i might add . after inspecting it more i noticed dozen more places where it ripped . i noticed parent said same thing . now i know why it half off ! don't waste your money .	-1
it good toy but balls rather small youmust check seams when they arrive poor sowin	-1
we bought this shopping cart my daughter birthday replace cheapie one she'd before . her previous one cost under $10 ( gift ) there no comparison one little tikes one . old one flimsy get go , faded quickly , when it broke , left sharp edges plastic . little tikes cart much , much sturdier safer . i put it together less than 30 minutes , even my daughter ' help ' . there nice deep basket holds good amount pretend play food or whatever else your child wants push around . seat doll folds against cart just like real shopping cart , easily holds good variety different style dolls . empty shelf under basket nice touch , perfect stashing more groceries . this cart definitely worth extra money , i'd gladly buy it again	1
without doubt , this best shopping cart available ! 1 . sturdy2 . little seat baby doll- easy get baby doll out it makes it more like real thing . 3 . holds ton food . both our kids , 26 mo . girl 15 mo . boy love this !	1
i bought it my niece , she love it , play it instantly . i not buy accesories because she use any single toy she put it	1
we got this cube before my son born . he enjoyed playing it since he very small . first he would just look it , then he started moving flap bullseye now he grabs all different parts it really manipulates it . different rings sections grab make this great toy child learning reach . my son now six months old he still enjoys this toy	1
our 3 month daughter loves this toy . it multiple shapes colors visual devlopment enough different textures keep her busy while i write this review . very good product	1
it very educating entertaining toy ; my baby only 6 months old he loves it ! he shakes it scratches it !	1
i came across this item accident while doing my christmas shopping yesterday . not only am i sure my 6 year old son love this ... i love it ! lol ! it really cool . you push top it pops open while wings shoot out . there flashing lights sounds . you put any number codes all beginning bat access games activities . it keyboard it just like real laptop which i am thrilled . now my son type his computer instead mine ! lol ! i played it myself probably half hour . sure there some things he wont able but it wouldnt much fun if he already knew how it . it definately something him awhile . only small complaint i would screen could bigger . size top laptop actual screen used very small . i dont see why they could not utilized more screen still room list bat codes . either way , i am sure any batman fan would love this , any little boy love this ... any mother who looking cool , fun , educational toy love this ! best part me lights you turn . there probably 2 or 3 settings lights help you see screen so much better . great feature well wings which dont really add much except it make any young boy think he something batman might actually use ! i totally reccommend this " toy " anyone boys ages 5 7 or even 8	1
my two little girls , 2 3 years old , love this table use every day . i bought it month ago it still their favourite toy . they love it so much they want eat their meals it also . it expensive but well worth money . i love fact there enough space benches their friends sit create . table also large enough each child their own drawing space	1

my daughter 2 1/2 she loves dora . she loves playing dora babies	1
let me just say this : my 4 year old certifiable dora nut . she loves her . you could give her bag dora it she'd think it cat meow . but , i must say , mom-mom came through big this toy her 4th birthday . she loves dora feeds twin babies bottle attached her hand . she loves little song dora sings big sister when she presses dora hand . she already singing it around house . feeding accesories cute durable well twin babies themselves all too cute themselves . also , since my four-year old daughter twin well - she twin brother - i think she really relate this toy level well . great toy	1
unlike all bad reviews this doll , i want say how wonderful this doll she everything it says box , i know lot people says she doesn't cry but she it takes while if your child plays her lot feeds her right way she cry , our doll cry every time my daughter squeezes her hand , even my 8 year old son loves make her cry , it over all great doll my daughter dresses her different outfits take her everywhere she goes ...	1
this best kitchen out there . my kids it year now . ( 4 2 , girl boy ) they love it . they play it everyday . we tons kitchen accesories they all fit . freezer one open space , fridge one shelf , stove one shelf pantry one shelf . so this doubles your storage too . my husband put it together , no problems . i must add ... box came very damaged ( it very heavy i guess ups guy wasn't happy ) . it ended up 4 major pieces badly damaged . i called kidkraft they sent brand new pieces ( big sides ) no questions asked !!! so top off great product great company .	1
my girls love this kitchen . they play it everyday . it lot storage so you store play food , dishes , etc	1
i bought type fridge attached . my daughter loves it . i researched kitchen sets well , this far most reccommended ! love it love it love it !	1
i bought this my 5yo daughter . it actually one better dora games i've seen . runs very similarly television show . offers little bit more spanish than show . it probably tad ' easy ' side its age group though my daughter didn't find it particularly difficult , but didn't phase her interest any . it now become one her favorites smile games	1
i needed kitchen my 3 yr old daughter would fit into very small space ... but one enjoyable play . we received it very quickly , time her birthday , although she not played it yet ; i test run it it seems made very well ; especially price . it small but many different little areas she work either slide out or open up . it would probably difficult more than two children , max , really play this same time ( again b/c size ) unless they some other accompanying toys like table chairs so one child could chef others could help preapre food table or customers , taking turns , etc ... tipping over part reviewer mentioned , hers against wall ; i think most people their toy kitchens so i dont think would problem . all ; good basic kitchen great price	1
my 3 year old my 1 year old play so nicely together this toy . my only complaint it could heavier bottom ; it toppled over couple times . otherwise , it great ; they love ' burners ' which make noise light up . i bought some more accessories because there not too many included	-1
after surveying lots kitchen sets , i decided buy star kitchen my kids( 1.5 1.2 years old ) . it turned out great choice . my kids love it , i love it , too .	1
set great rule book refreshed my memory . item not come color shown . i wanted pink one i got red taupe set . kind disappointing	1
i bought this my 3 year old daughter . she loved it store i thought it cute . i also agree other reviewers there should instructions stickers , but you don't need genious figure out where they go . i chose not sharoen pencil because she 3 i didn't think it necessary . twenty dollars it good buy . i know my daughter loves it lot fun it	1
overall this nice toy . my daughter loves animals if your child this would one they would enjoy playing over over again . it comes everything you need care puppy . puppy soft very huggable . only thing i would suggest it should come small bag keep all pieces . my daughter ends up throwing all pieces into carrier dog it they jiggle spill out sometimes when it carried around . it would also help avoid losing those small pieces . other than , we love it	1
i always thought clue looked like complicated game i'd never touch ! until i played it my friends house ! now i'm clue fanatic trying collect all versions ! this game never get old because it different outcome every time ! i strongly reccomend it anyone 8 older	1
this little difficult figure out beginning - actually read instructions - but it very fun very disney . fam loves it	1
i always loved b-wings told myself one day i would get one . these new releases caught my eye so i spent my own money get one . i not disappointed . b-wing awesome !!! it copies design features fighter movie very carefully , so it good-looking model actually , b-wing movie pretty ugly , this copies ship movie , but i've played enough video games respect its firepower . i guess it doesn't look too bad . it nice lego , but nothing perfect . here pros cons . pros : good 15 inches tall , this thing monster ! it looks really neatthe service tower nice thing realistic playwith tower display stand , this thing looks cool your bedroomfor huge fighter , it actually easy play withthis thing would probably rock star wars ship battles kids like me its 7 guns . not too hard buildcons : kind expensiveit doesn't break often , but when it , it tough repairit not too hard build , but it take whileit doesn't balance too well service tower/display stand because it so heavy . don't touch it though you'll finethe ten numb minifigure doesn't look too good my opinionyou open s-foils manually . you think lego would little gear-wheel open it . missiles zip range , but lego never really came through missile department anywayengines look bit tiny compared rest modelthe mechanic minifigure(whichever one you choose use , i like use ten numb minifigure)doesn't lot room stand onthe pilot minifigure kind hard fit inoverall , most flaws tiny it really cool ship worth $35	1

my daughter loved it her birthday . it really cute	1
we bought this our son christmas present . he not quite two yet , i thought he might not totally get concept this would toy i could put up later . boy i wrong . he loves this puzzle set . i find he plays it longer gets less frustrated if i first let him pick out which picture he wants " build " then take necessary shapes out place them next him . he very proud himself once he gets pieces then he'll give himself big round applause(which mommy daddy also ) . great self-esteem builder fun way teach shapes	1
this brightly-colored , sturdy pattern block set . i would give this set child 20 months 3 years . my 22-month old just loves it . soon he saw it ( hidden away , intended christmas gift ) he kept me open it . i finally gave , i am so glad i . he perfect developmental level this toy ! he tries match up shapes colors , even starting name shapes his own . this such exciting age ! i like how solid wooden boards double-sided very sturdy . there more than enough pieces go around- even if few lost over years . few pictures arrived some scratching , but i think this more annoying me than it my child . don't forget these patterning blocks also used independantly boards . this enables your child come up more challenging creations she or he developes greater skill this area	1

our little girl absolutely loves puzzles , this one presented real challenge . pieces somewhat irregular , left right , which allows growth her problem-solving abilities . i bought this when she 22 months , she able master it quickly . not only pegged pieces help define fine motor skills , but numbers , colors , left/right make this multi-dimensional learning tool . she 24 months now , most colors down well learning count . colors really helpful , because neurotic parent , i beginning wonder if she some colorblindness because she wasn't recognizing colors first . but silly me , i forgot she toddler . so much my fears why she isn't solving quadratic equations .	1
definitely must buy !!!! my two year old learned her right hand her left hand using this puzzle . not only she understand concept counting 1 10 , but she also understands each finger each hand different other . this puzzle teaches spacial concepts , counting , colors , coordination . i wish there more puzzles like this one . if anyone knows any , please contact me through amazon . chrische	1
this puzzle through two kids my house it still great shape . cardboard thick durable . picture friendly interesting . it favorite my kids . however , if you buying this puzzle two-year old or younger , this puzzle very cumbersome solve simply because pieces gigantic . small child solves puzzle , he must basically crawl over it reach other parts causes pieces come apart . floor puzzles like this one caused some aggravation my kids simply because they can't avoid getting puzzle reach sections undoes their work . we found smaller sized pieces easier solve , long fine motor skills allow . just something keep mind ..	1
this such cute puzzle your thomas train fan love it . it comes thomas train-shaped box pieces large enough toddler grab fit together . my son 2 1/2 he loves this puzzle put most it together himself . i highly recommend it	1
my 28 month old son got this puzzle christmas loves it . he put it together first time out box himself . it first thing he every morning then several times day . my almost 5 year old likes it too . it not sturdy melissa doug floor puzzles , but it still really sturdy .	1
my son three yrs old 42 inches , we keep it next last highest setting it enjoyable him we probably need put it highest setting soon probably need bigger one next summer . he alot fun it although it not very tall or not ability go tall some other models , he still fun trying aim shoot hoop so we use it practice these skills before buying . you definitely need fill base sand before using ( not use water substitue ) it tip over repeatedly without sand per directions . overall just like any basketball set this one provides great outdoor/indoor fun well exercise durable compared others its price point . we not problems height adjustment bar or any parts falling off my son rough this toy b/c i not fill sand right away it fallen numerous time seems wearing well . so i think it great deal price	1
i bought this basketball hoop my son who two loved shoot hoops . great height small kid , but difficult adjust , latch always got stuck . also , after few months , latch broke right off . now i hoop too low basketball any fun my son . now it just $30 peice trash	-1

growing up , my family always loved playing games , so now i am starting family my own , i've collecting old favorites my own " game library . " game life one first games i purchased , but i could not more disappointed quality " new improved " game . game i grew up buildings , bridges , houses , etc . permanently embedded into game board . new game , these 3d decorations come off placed board each time you play . this my main complaint new game . every time you accidently knock board or brush one buildings your sleeve , they fall off . add this age-old problems people not staying cars spinner not working properly ( it worse new game , way ) game life becomes game frustration . after one game new game board , our family decided we would not play game again . i am now looking auction sites trying find one " old fashioned " game boards . they really took step backwards this one	-1
step 2 fantastic brand , slowly climbing up ladder alongside fisher price , little tikes etc . my kid loves motorcycle , so what better toy buy than his own ride-on motorcycle ! this toy extremely durable . it might take kids while get used balancing bike , so it doesn't topple over - but scrapes bruises part growing up ! bike little taller than i thought it would , which meant my child tiptoes first couple months - but its strong , cheap exciting toy any kid	1
my son got this his second birthday it his absolute favorite toy ever ! next week his third birthday he still plays it every single day . he rides it house , outside down our sloped driveway even takes it park . we actually make trails him woods so he could go off-road it ! this toy definitely gets 5 stars my book ! it sit little high , but makes it perfect someone his age	1
i love this little dog ! i named him max he just cutest little critter fun watch listen my music	1
i am so disappointed . i remember doing this child far superior results . why they make toys so cheaply now . i would gladly pay more toy actually what it says . it not spin fast enough evenly distribute paint . my daughter not seemed mind yet enjoying toy but knowing how it should operate i am very disappointed .	-1
this looks like such great toy , packaging really impressive , but don't fooled like we . i assumed paying close 25 dollars it would somewhat durable-just reasonable durability-i don't expect much plastic toys ... but this really really bad . you might also think paying much would give you things like closable doors ... you know , 99 cent matchbox cars ' doors stay closed , but space shuttle doors don't-which limit it " fun " factor . " movable arm " just free floating plastic stick simply stuck into hole .. it doesn't even stay . " launch pad " fuel tank/boosters down right horrible . they don't connect shuttle , which disapointed all us , especially my son . it so cheaply made , i really can't believe it wasn't bought dollar store . my son so excited this set . but after playing it just few minutes he hasn't gotten it out again . i would definately not recommend this	-1
i've got this thing my twins ne = ew year , they've enjoying it one day so far . we two sets , it much more fun than just one - going one shooter against two robots indeed deathwish . i don't know how durable it prove - robots suffered some tumbles without ill effects , but it only one day . one drawback i found toy inability go shooter shooter - some reasons pistols , when set team team , refuse shoot one . but it fun toy nevertheless . only educational value i discern this set little bit understanding just how stupid computers , may realization light " bullet " gets reflected off white surfaces , so robot canshoot you even when its back turned toward you . otherwise , not eductaional all . thankfully :)	1
i gave this purse my niece her second birthday , she never put it down . keys cell phone her favorite . she put it her arm , ready go ! i would recommend this anyone who gift give little girl . they feel just like mommy	1
i bought this helmet hoping it would big enough fit adult . i pleasantly surprised when it big enough wear comfortably ! while there no headband or suspension , inside padded foam , whole thing light enough it very comfortable . any helmet get stuffy wear , but front visor opens up so much it very easy breath , you could wear this hours . electronics inside speaker repeats same sequence , microphone doesn't work , but overall look so good it doesn't matter . i plan putting together astronaut suit this , it would perfect outfit halloween parties	1
my kids 4 6 both love this , i bought it my 4 year olds birthday . i really liked fact it folded flat easy store , however , my husband i yet figure out !	1
little scary . i'm sure it fluke , but one i bought inside one tent inseam not sewn around metal frame tent , therefore portion metal frame available toddler . possibility breaking small metal pieces all i could invision . therefore i sent product back . other 2 tents perfect condition , 3 tunnels , so i said , i'm sure it fluke , but didn't want take chance my 2yr old	-1

my 11 month old son received this christmas . he loves it , goes it more than all other toys he got christmas . easy little fingers , entertaining , great practicing fine motor -- pounding , pushing , turning . little tykes really hit mark this one ! much better than kitchen my daughter	1
we discover sounds kitchen ( which great ) so i decided try this toy . it not nearly interesting kitchen but girls enjoy ball drop nails . i think it decent toy price , but i wish it more interesting parts it .	1
play game itself great -- similar scattergories you'll coming up words fit certain category looking them start certain letters alphabet , but several twists make it even more entertaining . one beef i really this game deck available categories too small -- just two or three games you'll begin repeat categories . so , you may wish augment deck categories your own	1

ok , so my daughter appears like toy , but it driving me crazy !! music singing voice incredibly annoying -- far most annoying all her toys ( which saying something ) . furthermore , whatever educational value there may voice saying " red pan " when red pan placed top yellow one subverted when my daughter figured out ( within 2 minutes opening box ) how press button get same result . so we just hear " red pan ! red pan ... red pan ... red ... red ... " over over . i personally am suspicious these toys so many sounds lights music voices etc etc not encourage development imagination .	-1
parents find songs really annoying !! :) my baby thinks this greatest toy ever ! he 10 months old these two months so far . he loves taking pots out putting them back getting them play music , over over over over .... we put it away every once while so it doesn't drive us crazy , but baby , it great !	1

i bought this my 5yo daughter . it actually one better dora games i've seen . runs very similarly television show . offers little bit more spanish than show . it probably tad ' easy ' side its age group though my daughter didn't find it particularly difficult , but didn't phase her interest any . it now become one her favorites smile games	1
i waiting this game come out my daughter reward potty training . my daughter just turned 3 this game very easy her navigate , previous poster stated some other v-smile games hard control . graphics characters voices if your watching cartoon dora . this game also very educational teaching spanish english colors numbers . also they teach animal sounds recognition animals ( both underwater farm animals ) . today first day we it so i'm sure i'm missing lot this review , but this game far best v-smile game them all we all v-smile games ( we keep up date when new games come out ) .	1

i ordered this particular bunco set because company description said it pink ! i received very ugly cream red set .	1
this game people play if they're drunk or mindless ... or some cases both .... it completely pointless uninteresting ... if ur just going play bunco see if u get 21 snake eyes you either love waste time or just stupid ... sorry but i mean think it ?... why pay money this when i just use dice other more interesting board games i already own ? not waste your money ! ~ *even if you manage make game interesting creative thinking little ... you still shouldn't buy it ... b/c like i said before just use dice other board games you already own !	-1
i played this game bunch times today . game pointless , slow , boring . only thing i liked ringing bell . point game roll 21 ones , then twos , then threes , etc . how lame . i recommend you try yatzee instead	1
tattoos really nice , but ink part ( markers ) wash off easily . black tattoo outline seems last several days	1
we got this my daughter her 2nd birthday . she plays it daily love pretend she doctor darby . she puts him bed his kennel everynight just like we our real dog . would highly recommend this toy	1

okay , original b-wing little under-scaled wasn't very accurate movie . lego gained alot popularity over years , alot more than before . alot people asking new b-wing because : 1 . they weren't fans time get it . 2 . b-wing just so cool . here my review : b-wing , well , just looks so nice ! i don't know why it called b-wing , since it resembles more than anything else . oh well , still cool ship . you get two minifigures , b-wing pilot dressed nice looking red . you get sullustan pilot named ten numb . ( yes ten numb real star wars character , he dressed red return jedi . ) i think ten numb looks great . if you see his actual picture , i think you would agree . b-wing pilot classic smily face what looks racing helmet . shweet ! two pilots you only need one . b-wing masterpiece . not only it look more accurate than it previous self , it more accurate . b-wing itself very sturdy . two cons come b-wing though . one them missiles shown not fire properly . you must tilt b-wing so , which very annoying . those dreaded stickers . you never really get them right . oh well , i don't even put stickers anyway . b-wing comes nice yellow black service station tools so you display b-wing . i don't use it because reality , b-wing lands horizontally . but it still nice used other sets if you like . all all , this b-wing literally destroys old . you get two pilots when you only need one . price isn't bad considering pieces . i think every fan should own least one these . i'm still trying figure out shape though ..	1
i bought this game my 11.5 year old daughter she not thrilled it . she played it once or twice bored it . it not good game if you want toy your child love	-1
my kids really enjoy playing candy land dvd game . there 3 different games play you play fun or play win each game . kids running bouncing around , i really like fact mats pretty much stay put carpet . unlike other games , kids not slipping sliding or falling down mats . i believe this game rated ages 4 up , but i think most 2 3 year old kids could play most games if not all games . my son 2 he play all games ( we help him bit ' mister mint says ' game though )	1

[ ... ] my sister i thought we would able instant message using these across neighborhood . so we split up , loading " chips " . our displeasure , we walk all way back , switch " chips " put them . this not very good toy . first , you annoyingly scroll through each letter . example , type , you press select button 25 times enter it , so messages take least 5 minutes . then you physically hand these little chips your friends . it would 100x easier just talk them . there ton little gadgets like these , but this one worst . you better off just talking or buying toy this nature , nobody wants walk , switch " chips " walk away .	-1
my daughter loves open close microwave , refridgerator door , oven door . she also likes sounds this makes . my older daughter different model 5 years ago which she just adored . both seem really good , although prior one bit better ... door sturdier it came shapes " ice cubes " - they would put them shape sorter door , then push button they would come out . this one , you just place food shapes slots they fall out . also , there slot phone ... this model it just comes phone , no real " place " it . anyways , all all , this one good she enjoys it ( just turned 1 ) . definitely good buy 9mos+	1
my 17 month old enjoys playing this kitchen , mimicking mommy . however , past few months she really shown interest kitchen playsets 2+ child stand while using . she doesn't go this kitchen often she used . her , this toy seemed it prime 3 months ( 12-15 months age ) now she moved next level play . it cute toy introduces toddlers kitchen " ideas " , but it either needs more intrigue or younger age start . i think when she 9 months old or even just sitting up she would fun playing parts it-opening refrigerator/microwave/or oven , hitting stove make music play or turning " water " sink make music play . she may more trouble shape sorter then , but i think toys good grow into . i not recommend this 12-month toy . wait few months buy one 2+	1
my daughter got this gift her 2nd birthday . not only she love putting puzzles together - double fun two-sided - her 4 yr old sister also enjoys it . it useful teach more complex concepts our 4 yr old , such 2 triangles make square , 4 triangles make rectangle . both girls really enjoy this toy , all melissa doug toys , it very well made withstand abuse . just wish it easier fit plastic cover , we can't seem fit shapes neatly close easily , especially hurry . minute inconvenience . great toy	1

over all good gift children but i feel maybe you could added few peices paper . thank	1
this christmas purchase our house this year we found game incredibly fun familiar classic level very strategious advanced level . one drawback we found annoying fact pegs not fit well vertical grid board always falling out , or case planes sometimes impossible get out without pliers we keep handy when we play . there four holes grid part support pegs these holes not hold peg anything . this really detracts otherwise superb game	1
this puzzle great , i'm glad i bought it my 2 year old , claire . however , like most toddlers , she prefers things her size . i find hands this puzzle slim adult sized hands , like my own . maybe makers felt " mommy " sized hands way go , or simply they wanted fill space standard sized wooden puzzle . i think it would nice make hands toddler sized , chubby palms fingers . said , it great tool . we don't use it much counting , though it intent . this more prop song fest " where thumbkin " even more exciting prop game " dr. claire " wherein she repairs " owie hand " . all all , fine addition your wooden puzzle collection	1
little hands well two hands this puzzle . bright , colorful art images thrilled my children . it well made sturdy . my children think this " big kids " puzzle since it isn't farm or baby animals . it makes them proud when they put it together	1
this puzzle through two kids my house it still great shape . cardboard thick durable . picture friendly interesting . it favorite my kids . however , if you buying this puzzle two-year old or younger , this puzzle very cumbersome solve simply because pieces gigantic . small child solves puzzle , he must basically crawl over it reach other parts causes pieces come apart . floor puzzles like this one caused some aggravation my kids simply because they can't avoid getting puzzle reach sections undoes their work . we found smaller sized pieces easier solve , long fine motor skills allow . just something keep mind ..	1
our son loves puzzle , only negative thing we would like add , when we opened box , pieces piece glue stuck it , unfortunately separating pieces torn puzzle piece , which my son notices . he not like see ( something broken - he says ) , apart puzzle lot use .	1

after priming board instructions indicated ... it still useless . chalk actually cuts into chalkboard so now , my daughter who loved chalk drawing can't use side easel . i wouldn't recommend this anyone if they looking product what it supposed . i wonder if makers even tried use it ... why would someone make product doesn't work then expect people buy it ... very disappointing	-1

first all i would like point out mr. i-was-40th-in-australia kind jerk . posting up reviews bash all other reviews page rude arrogant , frankly its pretty egotistical him act like his opinion better than all others this board . although it true , itself , this deck wont winning any tournaments , you dont insult people point out . just remember this customizable card game , so dont worry switching around cards this deck enhance it bi t.t hat said , i would like say this deck some really fun cards . my opinion , not only cards some great powers ( marauding captain able special summon monster just summoned example ) . one other thing note this deck it only 1 monster you need tribute summon . which means if you get monster your hand , you play it . my opinion cards this deck also some coolest pictures structure decks too . obnoxious celtic guards mid-evil look , beautiful warrior lady waste land , each card really colorful detailed . folks who design yu-gi-oh ! cards definitely went extra package this . other thing i want mention this deck its warrior specific . yu-gi-oh ! there more warrior-type monsters than any other type game . what this means warrior-type most flexibility , most customizable all monster types due massive amount abilities warriors . so when you go customize this deck , dont worry lack monsters , spells , or traps add it . final statement : warriors like rpg characters . some may start out weak , but get far better adding equipment them . so here my suggestion , look around different equip spell cards get idea what abilities you your different warriors just adding some good weapons . combine equipment right abilities your warriors wipe out anything your enemy sends you	1
well , i these cards while i love them ! i mean i thought 5 combos won duels all them . if your fan warriors i recommend you buy it . plus all you add few elemental heroes you mini jaden deck	1

i very tall 4 year old almost 2 year old . they constantly fighting over foot room big step 2 wagon . i broke down bought this $[ ... ] radio flyer navigator wagon . after using it couple months now , it well worth money . it considerably bigger ( wider seats , slightly more room feet ) plus storage seat boot . it much nicer ride ( nicer wheels , longer handle , feels less likely tip over even sharp turns ) . i use this wagon cart my kids everywhere , fromt mall museums . since this wagon holds up 150lbs , i figure i'll get couple years out it . very much worth money .	1
i purchased this wagon yesterday my 3-1/2 year old daughter . i absolutely love it . she over 40 inches tall fits it comfortably . i love cup holders storage area under back seat . you take this wagon anywhere place put snacks or other items . it very easy pull handle longer than most . alot room 2 children sit without constantly kicking each other . my parents purchased radio flyer all terrain wood metal wagon her her first christmas . its great wagon but now she wants one sit . it also fits back my van so we taking this parades walks now	1
when we looking wagons i tried so many them out store . i finally settled this one because i wanted plastic durability little flip up seats seat belts because i not too sure my 1 year old would sit still ride wagon . i casually mentioned this wagon described it my grandparents saying i putting it my son christmas list . 2 days later my grandpa called found wagon brand new yard sale $8.00 . you imagine ! my son got it birthday gift , it remained his favorite toys ever . he immediately climbed it sat down . we wouldn't fasten straps , but we usually . i like fact he can't fall out wagon backwards when we go uphill or if i start pulling it too suddenly . fact it converts flat bottom wagon also nice hauling stuff around garden or laundry one end house other . we typically keep wagon our garage , i move it side car opposite door house because every time i would let my son out house get car he would climb wagon cry when i got him out . every chance he gets he pulls it out its parking spot wants go ride . few times i brought it inside he played hours it- which 1 year old remarkable . steering little more difficult due handle atached wagon tires rotating instead traditional design , but just means it less likely tip over . it light even fit trunk our volkswagen passat lot luggage few other birthday gifts . i surprised ! we taking it trips zoo now . definitely worth money- it investment should last years	1

we bought this item 5 years ago while my son only 1-1/2 years old , then he couldn't reach pedal but wanted ride it so bad , since i'm petite ( 102 lbs . ) i drove it around our yard together my son . it great ! now my son already 6 years old little sister ( 2 years old ) they fun driving it together . my yard not smooth , it gravel driveway but i say this gator surpassed my expectation ! i noticed plastic wheels kept spinning uphill surface but just little push it works , other than my son loves driving it our dirt round-about it runs fine	1
i bought this my 5 year old march . after reading all reviews i figured i either going get lemon or not i not . this thing run into fences , swingsets , gas meters , house , sand boxes , trees you name it my kids pretty much ran into it im not just talking head either they run into poles axle nothing gone wrong . battery lasts atleast hour half around 100 lbs . ( 3 kids ) it riding so so slope . my son weights around 40 lbs . started problems getting started hill because he doesnt enough weight back but figured if he put it fast he get going . one thing i didnt like peg perego website makes it look like seat slides but you take some bolts off move it , also instructions like everyone says took me little over hour put together i think reason mostly because they only pictures no words . fact this hold up 130 lbs . amazing my children able use this years . my daughter ( 2 years old ) starting drive this now instead her little 4 wheeler . we thinking getting something else peg perego her . cant really think anything else im sure im forgetting stuff but i hope this helps your decision . i never contact customer support but sounds it other reviewers they seem pretty good	1
my 4 1/2 year old son got this his 3rd birthday it still going strong ! even after his uncle put tow hitch it he tows any thing he , including his sister barbie jeep . he " 4x4 "' , slams into things just generally very hard it ! compared his sister jeep cousin ride toys , turning radius best i seen , two front seats quite roomy battery holds better than i expected . it rides pavement , gravel grass ease running start make it up some decent grassy hills . it well worth extra money . only con i could find it isn't big enough me drive !	1

my husband i recently purchased this item our 3-year old daughter , although toy recommended ages 4 up . advised if your little one prone sticking small objects his or her mouth or if there baby house then i would probably pass this product . pack includes small , button-size " click-in controllers " which choking hazard . my opinion , real fun this toy comes rocketpack itself so small pieces always stored away smaller children . our daughter could not get enough out her new rocketpack . she even wore it when she brushed her teeth ( well , we pretend earlier our bathroom moon) ! reason i highly recommend this toy because it helps child use their imagination fullest . pack also includes activity card space mission activities which helps aid their imaginative play . rocketpack very durable good amount storage space . it even useful outside house . instead putting her newly found " treasures " ( a.k.a rocks flowers ) into mommy pockets , my daughter now place them her backpack . it so much fun our daughter , yet still practical . your little one pretend zoom into space no matter where they turbo rocketpack	1

i bought this my boyfriend he avid fan playing golden tee countless hours bar . actual joystick game very similar bar version , although graphics somewhat reminiscent nintendo circa 1990 . regardless , fun , well priced way simulate game your own home	1
i looking forward this game quite some time . i so happy finally get game . after installing 4 batteries i hooked game up my tv disappointed before i even started playing . graphics horrible screen shaky . besides look control panel this nothing like real game you find bars . i am surprised incredible technologies willing put their name this product . trackball joke . it barely spins you can't get any power your shots . you never see golfer like you real game when you putting you can't adjust hill , terrain , or anything else . putting too easy . there no way miss . driving fairway shots unreliable because weak trackball doesn't respond what you intend . i don't money or room my place buy arcade version so i figured this would good substitute . boy i wrong . there no course selection course you play absolutely boring . i am going return this unit tomorrow . it way too frustrating there no way get any enjoyment this game . i think i am going head bar now , play real game , drink until memory this cheap imitation long gone . i side note : i wish you could give product 0 stars . it doesn't seem fair 1 star lowest you go . one star gives this product way too much credit	-1
i got this my oldest three children ages 11 , 8 , 7 gift santa opening " balance " . children loved idea write checks now when they want something they write their " bankers " (aka mom dad ) check we buy it . so they learning once it spent its gone , so trying decide should they save or spend . since they no actual money its not burning holes pockets or getting lost . they actually thinking diffrent things when we say get your check book re-think decision wheather they really want it or not . i'm hoping it not only keeps them " borrowing " one but make sure they really want what they buy , so it not stuck toy chest within week . would given more stars but it early tell how this work long run	1

my initial reaction , " this stuff horrible " but came after my two-year-old threw it all over family room . course , it my fault thinking i could leave him under supervision his four-year-old brother while i changed my clothes . after destructive two-year-old went bed , my four-year-old asked me play moon sand him . few minutes later , i realized stuff really wasn't bad i first thought . yes , it messy , no doubt it . but upside , it vacuums up off carpeting very , very easily . moon sand not play doh . you can't roll it out like you play doh . you can't really use cookie cutters make shapes like you play doh . i would suggest getting one moon sand play sets or making sure you molds use it . when using molds , you pack it really tight kind tap , squeeze , tap get it out . only very gentle pressure destroy item you just spent all time creating -- moon sand very crumbly . i find it almost therapeutic squeezing it into big lump then breaking it apart fluffing it back up . consistency this stuff pretty cool . so , expect mess expect it going take little practice get hang it if you -- errrrr , i mean your kids , used play doh or clay . but , if your children enjoy crafty things or creating things their hands , they'll probably enjoy moon sand	1

assembled , this toy very pretty . especially when all dolls ( sold separately ) posed it . it very cute ! however , design/quality very poor . mattel needs keep mind parents sometimes need relocate or store toy , this playset cannot moved without falling completely apart . it falls apart when it played too . also , backdrop made out cardboard . cardboard ! it doesn't attach firmly keeps falling off . i don't think mattel bothers test market their toys actual children anymore . if they , they would know this needed more work before release . i guess it cheaper rush toy market before christmas than perfect produce quality product . if i able examine one these playsets before purchasing , i wouldn't purchased it	-1

when you first realize 2006 topps baseball card set 659 cards it , numbered 1-660 , you probably thinking you know which card missing card . because wake mickey mantle death several years ago topps decided honor mick retiring card #7 . today we say modern era baseball cards begins 1952 topps set , which mantle card biggie , not just because it his topps rookie card but also because it high number 1952 set , which jumps value way up well . however , there actually card #7 2006 topps set , it mickey mantle . what kind cool card it just like all other cards set there nothing distinguishes fact mick no longer active except his career stats ending 1968 ( he stole six bases his final season those ruined legs ) . card missing #297 , alex gordon , who turned out not meet new gold standard rookie card . there some cut out versions card floating around out there you want really complete series 1 collection ( opposed four incomplete collections same price ) . intact version sold $ 7,000 because clearly it rarest card around this year . topps cut outs because under major league baseball players association rules former university nebraska star , who second pick last year draft , not sign contract until september . after years baseball cards players who never spend day major leagues , mlpa changed rules so rookie cards now only put out players who make 25-man opening-day roster or played least one major league game year before . topps anticipated gordon would make royals ' 25-man roster , but third baseman assigned wichita instead . then again , when you get complete factory set you get 659 cards plus five exclusive bonus rookie cards , so now you up 664 deficit more than made up . solves mystery missing card 2006 topps set . personally , i think this rule change great , because i like see who playing each team each year . granted , difficult today because this set already johnny damon yankees ( #185 ) , but coco crisp ( #12 ) still indian not damon replacement red sox . tom gordon ( #163 ) appears phillie photo back , but his card still says yankee matt morris ( #238 ) seen cardinal front his card giants . main thing when you get rookies , cards 296-325 series 1 #616 -45 series 2 ( jason papelbon , #355 , one two exceptions ) , you actually find players who major leagues right now , including prohibitive favorite american league rookie year award , francisco liriano ( #309 ) twins . this beats going back couple years looking all rookie cards finding only handful made it show this many years down road . topps set remains set me each year because it one history behind it , so if you feel same way it must your collection . cards #243 -59 american national league gold glove award winners , set missing a.l. catcher , who not i-rod but jason veritek , who not topps card again this year . we then award winners two leagues cy young , most valuable player , rookie year awards ( #260 -65 ) , followed team cards/managers ( #266 -95 , 586-615 ) . what they doing here interesting , because they teams arranged alphabetically arizona diamondbacks washington nationals , what you hear manager card or team card each , but never both ( e.g. , you get mets manager willie randolph new york yankees team card ) . series 2 , you find appropriate counterparts . there team stars both series . it interesting me both series 1 series 2 when you look three checklist cards each cards series end front second checklist card . rest checklists devoted insert cards available . series 2 they list seven trading places autographs trading places autographed relics each , 27 trading places relics , 20 trading places cards , 40 signers constitution , 31 signers constitution cut signatures ( includes franklin , hamilton , madison washington ) , 30 hit parade cards , 15 topps stars , 100 mantle home run history cards ( " mhr2-mhr101 ) , 100 mantle home run relics , 18 walmart cards , 15 opening day relics , 15 opening day inserts . me trading places hit parade cards interest , because they sort basic reflect what actually happened 2006 season , but rest surely takes us into realm glorious excess . no wonder i am " buy complete series " rather than " tear open hundred packs " sort person , because i really not want position hoping autograph roger sherman rather than billy wagner ( or visa versa ) . topps one baseball card set i get each year because history company not because extras	1

we thought this game bit pricey , but you get much better-made game than plastic-and-cardboard ones nearly same price . glass ' jewels ' , metal dubloons , metal ships , velvet purses , cloth gameboard all stored very well-made wooden bookshelf case strong magnetic latch . game play not limited preset course or path , but up player determine direction route . treasures gathered raiding , trading , or attacking other players . extra powers received becoming " dread pirate , " but this lost combat player . rulebook includes basic rules advanced variations keep play interesting . like all games , die rolls luck sometimes play large part but always changes . i expect it eventually become monotonous , but long after most other games would become excrutiatingly boring . rules easy alter ( such more or fewer jewels gather ) experiment other variations keep it interesting . bottom line : much more - both fun ( especially ) quality - than other games same price . we no ' buyer regret ' purchasing this game all . top-notch all way ; we could ( ) gotten far less same price . highly recommended	1
i got this my grandson ( 6 ) who wanted it because commercials . stated most other reviewers , it just doesn't work . everyone who bought it should able get their money back , or mattel should send each one free car work . it piece junk . terrordactyl works very well , but you'd crazy buy crazy croc . maybe we should all send them back company out complaints .	-1

this game really great i highly recommend it . my 3-yr old girl my 7-yr old boy both really enjoy it . even though my daughter doesn't know all characters , she search color match pictures her bingo card pictures screen . because it random anyone win which , course , kids love . this also great grandparents who know nothing nickelodeon characters want fun , low-key game play . spongebob little video tutorial beginning , so there no difficult instructions understand . also means it takes just couple minutes before you're actually playing . there little montages throughout ( like 2-min . shorts ) featuring various characters keep their attention . we play this again again . they should come up version magnetized chips so we play car	1

my " not quite four year old " received this product christmas gift . he loves building toys , loves cars , enjoys putting together toy cars . this easy four year old manipulate , but allows child create his or her own designs . it works manner similar k'nex , but pieces easier snap together , therefore less frustrating	1
i recently gave this car birthday gift four year old boy my home daycare . he loves it so much ! it very detailed yet still very rugged . he two problems it but older child would more patience . it difficult getting his batman sit all way down seat . unless he all way down , top won't close popped off ( it looks difficult pop off , but this kid it ) . it easy adult pop back . second issue getting arrows shoot out back into guns . you rotate them until they pop . these pretty minor problems if you child little patience overall quality far outweighs these issues	1
my 5 year old hooked this toy when it first came out . now movie just released dvd it contains lot batmobile footage .... he hooked all over again ! my kid really hard his toys most missing heads , arms , legs , broken or dismantled within day . this toy still working 100% still one piece ! this not junk toy well worth money spent	1
product impressive but it more delightful if miniature batman included . i thought miniature batman included this product . well anyway , product impressive	1
we recieved this part gift box my mom bought costco . i didn't think much it when i saw it but it bright colorful . also package blue hippo blocks inside it plunger push them out . frankly speaking my 6 month old ( time , now 7months ) didn't know what it , it didn't capture his attention . however wow ! this gadget triangle ! my goodness !! there so much look , he captivated it . :) he'll play one side triangle so long he forget it activities other sides . so every 10 minutes or so , i'll flip it he gurgle renewed enthusiasm start playing ' new ' side ! when my son gets sleepy lies back his nursing pillow , often i'll hold it up turn it back forth so he watch 2 gears race up down . one them moves zig zag pattern other spins , its even fun me watch . side note , its great exercise your wrist . it also makes pleasant sound , when tiny balls rattle , sounds like your shaking box salt , not too loud , perfect drowsy baby . i also like : 1 . it so many toys it but just one piece , so no lost parts or cleanup . 2 . no batteries needed . 3 . its not loud toy , just loud enough . i highly highly recommend this toy , its really bargain ! one update : 9 months , my child still crazy triangle . i believe whole infantino gift box both toys $[ ... ] . no batteries needed . :) what bargain !	1
gift my sister 6th birthday . i over-joyed because i one when i her age . i ended up decorating crown , although i'm sure she could handled it , i just think she wouldn't thought make pattern make it look nice . setting game board up little hard . you remember how colors go otherwise it won't fit just right . it like puzzle almos t.t he jewlery just like classic game , simple easy take off . yes it cheap that good thing seeing how both my sister i forgotten take off one piece well after we played game . jewlery even fit me 22 so even us big kids play ! there isn't much difference this one original except you cinderella themed board edges clock tower . if original cheaper then get one . it won't make difference girl because game still same . only downside when we played just two players it hard get rid clock tower ( which you need , win ) . we would just end up going around around board either trying get rid tower or trying get " take any piece " circle get crown . we ended up making it so if you landed clocktower after you already it you put it back game board . i think three or more players we could just keep circling but just us we use cheat . thing us when i tried open one earrings it fell apart this first time we played it . it didn't break , i just pop it back into it tiny holes but it still sucked since it new game .	1
my daughter loves this game . it not educational , but usually better than watching tv . advantages- box takes up little space . i actually like how board 4 puzzle pieces this reason , not find it flimsy . - jewelry seems durable other play jewelry me , but i not bought disney jewelry before . - spinner/ jewelry box seem very durable , such great idea . - my daughter loves just playing jewelry dressup . disadvantages- not very educational ( little strategy involved ) . - many fathers would not willing play this game . - game pieces so much fun apart game , they may become los	1

tamagotchi connections very cool . they usually sold out lots places because right now they so popular . they're really fun play because you play games enter codes online , buy stuff , feed them like real parent would . they're not best bring school though because they distract you class . it usually best leave them home put them pause . most people think they're pretty dumb so if you like playing electronic toys , then you should maybe consider buying one these . if you decide buy one these you might want buy extra set batteries case yours runs out . they're platinum batteries tamagotchi hold two	1
my friend three tamagotchis they so fun play wit ! minis make no sense but still v3 so awesome	1
my 3 year old grandson wild cooking shows especially emeril . so his mom . he would set up large ottoman his mother pots pans . now he his own utensils loves them . his favorite his own timer which only times one minute	1
i this ant farm child loved it . it very educational entertaining . ants created their own little community , connecting " highways " ( tunnels ) , graveyard ( they carried dead ants one little area farm buried them ) , even food " cellar " ( they stored all their extra food one little area bottom farm ) . my ants lived several months only died when my mother cleaning house tried move it . tunnels all collapsed ants killed . i am currently 4th grade teacher purchasing this my classroom . i am going use it teach habitats communitites , but most importantly lifeskills . ants exemplify so many lifeskills ... patience , cooperation , perseverance , endurance , caring , effort , problem solving , etc . wow !! so much we learn one tiny creature .	1
ant farm wonderful educational toy , but quality disappointing other reviewers said . plastic rough , unattractive edges manufacture , bottom not perfectly flat , so it wobble little bit . none this matter my nephews , but certainly manufacturer should better job	-1

our 5 year old daughter got this holiday gift . it turned out favorite game entire family friends . it clever , fun , fast creative game whole family . even our 2 year old son loves it - however it changes whole out come game . he stands back just throws toppings wobbling pie but he entertained 15 or 20 minutes so that worth lot ! we'd recommend this birthday gift kids because it unique fun	1

i used love playing 3x3 rubik cube kid decided get it my son christmas . i mistakenly ordered 4x4 , but decided it didn't matter - still same kind fun challenge . day it opened , stickers started come off when i tried use it , within first 30 seconds , four pieces came off , one which broke can't fixed ! i just went online order 3x3 , but finding similar reviews stickers , etc . what disappointment !	-1
i bought cube , it ruins week later . one center pieces broke off , it irreparable . i saw it coming , though , because cube started showing signs flakiness second day : some stickers ( mostly orange ones ) begun peeling off , pieces getting very loose , very fast . cube burst side pieces out two occasions before its final destruction . i gentle possible , but if you learn how solve cube , then you'll performing thousands turns it . both 3x3 5x5 cubes seem hold up lot better than 4x4 . i'm hoping i find manufacturer . i've played 3x3 cubes many manufacturers over years , some obviously better-made more durable than others . this isn't one good ones . if you're going make serious attempts solving your 4x4 , i recommend lubricating it something . cube-solving sites seem recommend silicone spray ( whatever ) . when i high school i'd take them apart put vaseline them , which smooths over " catches " happen you turn rows slightly misaligned , also slightly glue-y effect holds it together better	-1
i bought this dissapointed . it not good turning all eventually i got angry threw it straight up watched it fall crash into nothing . most fun i've plane . if you're looking easy plane fly buy tyco rc sky scorcher it way better	-1

my daughter absolutely loves this playset . it fairly small compared ' normal ' sized playset comes different mini-ponies ( depending where you buy it ) . mini-ponies size littlest pet shop figures , without bobbling heads . accessories however tiny , i wouldn't recommend this set around any child younger than 4 . mini-ponies themselves fairly sturdy solid . there lot attention detail playset . also lots cute accessory sets purchased under $10 . i like fact you buy packs mini-ponies around same price regular sized pony . this great way good sized pony collection your child , without give up lots room . all all , i think this ponyville theme line mini-ponies hasbro keeper nice addition my little pony world	1
we given this gift when our son 5 months old . he loved it ever since . first he would lay under it kick toys , then we changed it so he could sit bumbo seat hit toys , then we changed it so he could stand it , now he walking 10 months loves walk over it his own . i think our son active guy probably destined early walker , but i credit this toy keeping him interested many stages his development helping us encourage his interest standing . it always easy change set-up this toy so he not bored it . whenever we play dates other babies , they love it too ! after it his life 5 months , he still loves play buttons rattles . i'm sure he'll continue use it he gets older art table or something . highly recommended	1
this monopoly game exactly what i looking . i impressed durable wooden property houses metal player pieces . " chance " " community chest " cards neat too because they relevant 1930 history . there only two things i think they could better job . first all , there aren't enough houses hotels . i played full-length game several others , end game we using household jiblets signify houses hotels . secondly , property prices not printed board . game comes paper sheet lists property values . it cumbersome keep referring easy lose track .	1

i'm not sure what people talking three foot radius . that how mine first , but i finally figured out how make them work . they more or less average 2 mile radius . i wouldn't expect too much , come people ! these kid toys ! they aren't going give 7 yr . old pair hundred dollar talkies , now would they ? main trouble getting battery . after we batteries , it came testing time . they work pretty well , except if it below 60 or 50 degrees . then , only one work , not even well . but , i figured out how make them quiter without turning them off ! hold you're hand over mouth piece really tightly ... it should elimanate most static . but , ten dollars , these very good pair . i am however saving up uniden ten mile radius 20 dollar adult walkie talkies	1
my son received this his 4th birthday . he his older brother , age 8 , spent lots afternoons playing this toy trying out all our cars . they great time i think this great product , much better than some other hot wheels tracks we gotten past . this would make great gift	1

i like handle carry this keyboard around , but it kind awkward little ones use unless it sitting table or other flat object . characters set off when they moved you get jumbled mass sound coming out it if it resting against something causes characters pushed all once . i know my 2 year old not like sitting still , so using this table not really option her . because height characters , it not good " bring " toy since it doesn't fit bag well . same price , go wiggles guitar . it many more buttons songs they carry it around play it same time	1

this toy purchased birthday gift our 5-yr old son . great toy . instructions story . we bought pedal type exercise value item . it scoop/lift front trailer back lots yard fun/work . i'm rn put multitude toys together over years . my husband engineer built our home , our son " treehouse " bed multitude safety features , fixes people air conditioners computers after experts fixed them they still don't work , etc ... we both use reading following assembly instructions . ( three children grown married . ) basically saying , we're not rocket scientists but we reasonably intelligent people . instructions come written words drawings show assembly . no where parts identified what they or how many included . there parts list if you need reorder something . part 4 ( shown drawing ) spst3215n . instructions don't assemble it numbers , just name . ( " insert screw , attach retainer " . ) there assorted screws different lengths . instruction simply read " insert screw ... " you wing it this one hope select right screw . instuction number nine reads " insert retainer special device . " seriously , " special device " . no where it identified what special device . i started it , my husband finished it it together working only one mystery part left . our son enjoying it loves helping yard even more now . great toy ! poorly written instructions . people who wrote instructions should return their salary hours , days or weeks they they employed write these instructions . very poor job	1
my 3 year old got this christmas . seemed like neat idea until he figured out if he picked it up it just really great , big tamborine . it also just encourages my kids get wound up . faster they move , more wild music . we never use it , i'm just waiting appopriate amount time pass before i sell it e-bay	-1
i trouble getting this product work , but only because i too eager play hadn't read enclosed instructions . initially , i set sensitivity all way 10 frustrated when it didn't work all . instructions say turn down sensitivity until lights turn off . once i , it worked great . sensitivity too high , it interpreting everything one constant movement not picking up changes , so it wasn't identifying my movements . now i understand instructions , i get it work anywhere . it such great toy , you can't not buy this one	1
we got this game something new family after thanksgiving dinner . this great game if you looking something just any age play . only limitation only 4 play time . we overcame this playing teams .	1
i so looking forward playing this my kids . i 9 3yr . old , big age difference hard find games we all play , so i thought kerplunk would perfect . older one would fun it something little one could play without stop mommy read card tell her what next . boy i wrong . first all while trying put thing together , where top bottom suppose fit perfectly together , they didn't , sticks suppose go through tiny holes couldn't because top bottom would not stay right some holes closed up . sticks also really flimsy two big top bottom pieces . i remember when i younger played it wasn't this soft plastic , it hard durable . end we tried play , first time after second stick pulled all marbles fell out so i never even got chance play . second last time we tried top fell completely off ! maybe , i just picked wrong box but i won't try convince myself it buying one	-1

based previous reviews written other people , screenshot this product ( also rediculous price ) , i bought this thinking i going get something replica . i wrong . this product biggest waste my money i long time . first all , one i recieved very rough texture card table part it , not smoothe like i expecting . second , spelltrap card zones rediculous , cards fly out back it simple flick your wrist . thirdly , place it takes your arm horrible . show , disks clearly attached duelist forearm close elbow , leaving plenty room hand movement . these attach literally your wrist actually require you hold disk one hand , making it very annoying hold , let alone look your hand . best feature it life point counter , even isn't great . it easier me callate math my head than it change numbers mark life point damage , couple calculators work much better than this pathetic system . all all , this definately not worth money . buy something else	-1

my eight-month-old received more toys than she could ever possibly play christmas , but this one far away her favorite . she loves it !!! she cannot play it enough . it adorable so clever -- so many features . only drawback it difficult push balls through top -- takes more strength than baby . however , she still great time it spent countless happy hours . i recommend it highly	1
my 6 year old son got this gift christmas immediately wanted make " food " . all recipes gummies basically same , you just change flavor suit your taste . we never find flavor or combination flavor he liked , ended up throwing out all treats he made . drinks equally bad tasting . there no directions how set up your " lab " , just lot connector pieces didn't seem fit everywhere you wanted them . other reviewers stated , you need adult there help mixing . he grew bored kit , put it away , not asked play it again .	-1
we thought it lot set up . lab not seem stable . my 9 year old could not snap mold covers molds not fill up all way mix , which left him 1/2 gummy worm . it messy , awkward not worth money we paid it . it trash . we wouldn't buy one . also piece used mixing - what odd design . i could barely pull it apart clean it make batch . save your money buy supplies make goodies bowl home	1
i got this toy my cousin who 6 . he loves it . course i help him it , reading experiments all but ok . it pretty messy sticky so adult around helps . he didnt like taste some experiments so we ended up just throwing them away . i also didnt really understand whole thing connecting lab together stuff . luckily he didnt care setting it up he just making food . overall it not bad toy . just few hitches	1
i've played game maybe five times . same questions came up least three out those five . short , no fun . it also not like game we see tv . so not worth cost . whoever created it should ashamed .	-1
this one best dvd games there ! i totally reccomend this game everyone , including kids . kids adults bunches fun playing game , but even more fun , just make deal other team say " best two out three games champion !! " because this family feud game very short but fun . one lamest questions they asked team : " what famous man sideburns ? " our family puzzled . course , who could thought abraham lincoln ??!! but although it short it one coolest games out there !! trust me , it addictive game ! pretty soon your party next day someone say , " hey , guys , wanna play family feud again ? " fun sure buy this!!!!!!!!!it great dvd game !!!!!! it works my laptop !!!!!!	1

no children ... bought this mobile my office , i'm setting my sights final frontier . better mobile might exist , but i never found it . mobile consists cardstock photos nasa ; i would not say it durable , but it hangs ceiling so should not deterent ... children should probably not hanging ceiling anyway . it easy put together if you two sets hands hangs beautifully once place . unlike lot other mobiles i saw , this one sun ... nice touch . i would highly recommend this product . world needs more mobiles	-1
this organizer looks great , i spent some serious money it , but end it disasterous . i use wonderful laundry hamper part , but once you put anything bins they automatically fall down because there nothing securing them . this product total let down	-1

my two year old new fan dora , so i bought her beach set this series stocking stuffer . say she loved it would understatement . so i bought her this ' go ' set get tico character , i thought she would like car . we many dora toys now , but little dora tico figurines this set very loved . what nicest them they small enough her hold one hand , so very portable . they also hard molded plastic , so while they aren't poseable , they also aren't breakable . she bring them bathtub , bed , play them meals sandbox . paint held up well wear . car wheels not turn , but it compartments very easy small child put dora tico out them push them around without it difficult maneuver . my one complaint this set opposed beach set tico nose very pointy actually rather sharp . i think recommended age this toy slightly older than my daugheter actually though	1

this bookcase looks great our playroom perfect height our 2-year-old put her things away . it hold more than it looks . great quality wood . i read reviews assembly problems , if i didn't screw up step #3 i would've fine . but i didn't realize i'd put piece backwards until i end . whole thing again- what backache ! but it worth it we really happy it	1
we needed storage system our 2 year old . this perfect it just his height , it great storage both toys books . i'm glad i read reviews first thought . i knew right away look hardware one bins ( although i can't imagine why customer service doesn't know tell you look there instead sends more)also , first time we tried putting it together , i couldn't get sides fit . we would get one screwed , but other side would then other side would off . we really trying force it , finally gave up after 30 min . i then read review one sides ( ) always faces you since other people put it together so easily , i thought i something wrong . we took then whole thing apart carefully followed directions , making sure we matched peices according picture given . this time everything came together nicely we 15 min . so other than installation ( which easy if you really follow directions carefully ) this great product	1
before you call little tikes order your missing hardware ( it arrives 1 week ) , pull apart trays make sure its not hidden there . since installing trays last assembly step , we just set stack aside never thought it again . otherwise , assembly took 1 hour not difficult	1

ok , i don't understand negative reviews this game ! this such fun great game . little ones play it because their isn't any reading involved . yes , adult take 5 minutes set up . leaves not come out ... i am not really comprehending what wrong . yes game quick ... you bees balanced leaves ... after first 5 pulls bees begin slowly drop people . purpose game afterall . it fun quick game unlike some tedious games like " candy land " . parent 3 kiddies under 5 ... i am very happy when games quick fun	1
it took several tries before i realized " trick " setting this game up more quickly . branches enter one side hive exit through hole other side . first , i found it frustrating get all leaves through exit holes . then i realized once you've inserted dozen leaves or so , rest don't exit . then just popped quickly find support properly inserted brances . i didn't think directions clear they should . i definitley fell prey " award winning " sticker box when i bought this game . however , more we play it , more i see educational value it . my 3 year old simply thrilled learn turn-taking we try make bees fall out . my 7 9 year olds definitely more into logic competition game . all told , once you've mastered branch issue , it really fun game worth space your family game shelves	1
i am not biggest fan bratz babyz , but once i saw three i thought they changed my mind , it ? no ! i got forever diamondz sharidan she gorgy !	1
leaping lizards wonderful compact matching game gamewright games , who make whole line inexpensive , educational fun board card games . instead conventional playing board , game played long cord which beads strung it . spaces beads playing spaces , players race get their little wooden lizard end . game play relatively simple . each player gets set " creature cards " . before every round , they pick one their creature cards their match . then creature tiles ( which two-sided ) lead lizard tile shaken up provided cup spilled out . if lead lizard tile smiley face showing , player whose lizard furthest back line may move their lizard many pieces forward they matched their creature card creature tiles . so if they chose dragonfly their creature card three dragonflies showing face up , they may move three spaces forward . if lead lizard tile shows sad face , player whose lizard front line must move their lizard back many matches they've made . matching skills only essential skill needed game , kids who still too young read play this game easily . it also completely game luck , which levels playing field different ages children . because this game super-compact size , it makes great travel game . it'll work airplanes or back seats , kids fun it hours . illustrations wonderful pieces made real materials . this great game	1

i bought this toy thinking kids going fun it pool . they , but only very short time . after batteries died we changed them new ones it became submarine . it dropped bottom pool never re surfaced . very frustrating	-1
just case you wonder if it collection , it same metal cars " normal " or regular edition . it only country or provider ( i guess ) . but they brilliant idea develop more cars movie . well , not more cars but more variant models . example , they this version mcqueen ( it looks last part movie ) . they first mater ( not re-colored one bowling game ) complete nose ( you get ) , dirt mcqueen ( like one one track game ) , hudson hornet ! yellow ramone . i uploaded back cover box just your entertainment . it whole catalog ! peru it costed me $9 each but they so hard get . it happened here they just disappeared regular stores .	1

we love this game . my girls ages 8 6 i play this game evening . they both struggling math , which not uncommon girls their ages . we tried reduce gender bias math skills providing materials enhance math understanding young children , unit blocks , sand water play cooking activities . we just couldn't break through wall . last christmas i bought dino math tracks other math related games . this breakthrough we needed . both girls math skills understanding math concepts improved leaps bounds	1
this game great ! tiny dinos spark my 5 year-old son imagination enable him so much fun he not realize he learning . furthermore , he not want stop !!! he learned place value up thousands during our first game . after each roll dice player uses all four dice make number then s/he reads number aloud ( i.e. if you roll 6666 you say six thousand six hundred sixty six ) . we move our dinos around board t.r. looks forward our pieces landing same track so we " showdown " . " showdown " you simply roll dice person who gets larger number wins . however , we move our dinos middle board miniature battle . player who rolled larger number wins battle . loser sent back home winner gets move ahead . after playing game couple times without using cards - which simplest level play this game - my son asked use cards . so day 2 we began using cards . again he uses his imagination great deal role play he carries out instructions . it fills my heart delight see his excitement see he truly learned how read numbers up thousands . ( t.r. learned read when he 4 so he independently reads dice reads cards . ) parent i highly recommend dino math tracks because kids quickly learn lot while loads fun . this game played three levels , so it grows your child	1
it amazing how something so simple spark excitement enthusiasm babies toddlers . friend this out her 1-year-old party all kids loved playing it carrying it around if it long train . my 8.5 month old watched all other kids crawling through so much fun he crawled over peered down tunnel . i thought he'd too scared go through , but since he seemed curious i decided sit him up one side while i ran other spoke him . instantly , he smiled me started crawling toward me through tunnel . he laughing seemed enjoy interesting view sensation going through tunnel . since he still working his crawling seemed love tunnel so much , i bought one our local toys us store he loves playing it!what great : - folds up compact ring storage/travel - approximately 19 " diameter ( size tunnel ) 2-3 inches thick . - see through windows allow added fun/peek-a-boo- velcro tabs connect tents other tunnels gives added flexibility how it used- encourages crawling/floor time babies - my little guy also likes sit up look around it , or just lie around rock it ( since it free-standing ) . considering he just discovered standing can't seem get enough pulling himself up everything , it good way keep encouraging him strengthen his crawling/sitting skills . durability : - it seems relatively sturdy , really " pops " open nicely . don't know how it stand up long-term . - careful velcro mesh windows - it stick windows snag it bit . - my friend party , i notice older kids ( 3-4 years old ) really wanted jump it smush walls - not good idea case there kids still crawling through tunnel and/or because tunnel walls not meant withstand kind play , but their point view , i see how tempting it may jump it see tunnel pop back up .	1
my 15 month twins love this tunnel . they giggle chase each other it every day . definately would recommend this toy	1
not bad , but i slight problem mine staying closed . i bend plastic pin get it stay locked . i paid $5.29 w/ free shipping , inexpensive	1

my daughter ( 4 ) absolutely loves this train . we've it year , i found her sleeping it other night . sounds great , she likes it moves bacwards forwards ( although it needs help mastering steep hills ) . my complaint ours sucks life out batteries extremely quickly ... it doesn't seem normal . i don't know if its just ours or if all them work same way , but most time batteries dead she just plays happily it making her own noise . if i it over i would consider one without batteries -- i really think she would loved it just much . however , she overjoyed when i put fresh batteries quickly wears them out again	1

this great game , my whole family , ages 6 65 , enjoyed thanksgiving	1
after months my friends son saying all he wanted x-mas huge elmo doll . i seen this item claiming " large " 25 " doll i agreed spending 60 something dollars get it . when he opened it my friend said it small looked sick . all they extend his legs few inches his belly strunk . needless say i highly disappointed dish out 30 something more dollars one alot bigger cheaper . so if you think your getting your moneys worth this doll forget it . i suggest " large elmo soft plush doll " fisher price .	-1
my 6 year old informed me shortly after opening this gift christmas morning it exactly what he asked santa ( thank goodness since he insisted keeping his list secret) ! we got his 3 year old brother remote control mator boys thoroughly enjoyed both toys ! i thought this especially interesting since they other remote control trucks , but there something characters cars movie really seems capture their imagination	1
i got this spare money me my brother my older parents . i only played it few times , but it worth money . some rounds fun challenging while others fun easy . usually last round , bonus round , easiest . it doesn't 10+ . my brother 8 he no problem playing it . it lots fun whole family , ages young old . my aunt it too , because she so obsessed wheel fortune , she wouldn't share it us ! so we took advantage bought it . boy , tv plug video game people made great hit this ! it truly one kind ! i also like childish constantly spin wheel controller even when game hasn't turned :) but now , this second , i am trying get it . it not turning ... could this end my game ? maybe ... i might check batteries . ok ? now , i must my way ..	1
i wrote this review because i not think this game should rated so low . my son picks cars play everytime we get vsmile out . i like it because he able drive car road out difficulty bigger systems or arcade games . he learning while he playing , too	1
package arrived quickly exactly described . very pleased this item would higly recommend this vendor	1
typical lego sets few pieces people put together , my kids always argue over who gets them . this set they more than enough people put them together build their cities adventures	1
i love this desk only $[ ... ] ! my son 1.5 yrs old loves read color we didn't small childrens table him sit down these kinds activities ( we live very small 2 bedroom apt manhattan ) i took my chances ordering this desk him , hoping it would comfortable ( right size/length his body legs ) we this desk now 2 months i receive so many compliments it . my son loves sit it all activites/reading even eating his snacks it ( crayon marks come right off simple wipe ) .!! his little legs don't yet reach ground , but little blue cubby below little lip allows his feet rest just perfectly ! ( this also how he gets up sit seat all himself ~ stepping blue cubby lip ) . it very easy put together well . box came without nuts bolts accident , but i called company directly they fed-ex'd n/b very next day ! great company great product ! i definitely give it thumbs up	1
shake go police car racer great - my almost 5 year old son loves it . good racing noises , he use some kid energy make it work . even though it requires batteries , it encourages him use his muscles charge up racer . seven good shakes get 5 full circuits race track . very engaging toy	1
we bought this tunnel over year ago our then-crawling almost-one-year-old . i figured it would encourage her crawl more , which it -- she loved it ! now she running , screaming , jumping , independent 2 yo who still drags this tunnel out back corner play area ( where i've tried hide it ) squeals excitedly when we pop it out her play . her older sister , who now 3 1/2 , also loves tunnel . she copies her aunt ideas stands upright tunnel pretend she monster , or hops it around her pretends caterpillar or frog . we don't yet any tent accessories , but we build our own tents sofa cushions sheets , then stick one end tunnel gap , you secret entrance special hideaway . this one those classic toys children all ages find lots uses -- it sparks creativity imagination , gives mom few minutes ' break go clean kitchen . ;-)	1
i ordered this tunnel my three year old she very excited it . she loves playing it . however , main picture product shows two tunnels joined together , so i expecting longer tunnel than we got . it still provides lots fun , just wish it long it looks picture	1
i really wanted baby doll my daughter ( 14 months)could take tub her brush/wash her hair , etc . this ok . it serves it purpose ... somewhat . dolls hair up band which i thought could just taken out but it actually " sewn " into her hair/head . so she can't really wash or brush dolls hair . water seat it comes also too difficult child put doll into . not worth money my opinion , i wish i would spent extra money gotten her gotz baby bath doll	-1

terrence probably not made track - since he tractor meant used fields , or plowing snow . said , this little guy goes everywhere our house we haven't any trouble tire treads . if your child prone pick such things like mine , just see if he get them off , then i suggest maybe advising otherwise . my little one figured out how get them off very quickly , but became aggravated they not when he " plowing field . " so , i put them back well , they haven't come off since . some neat role playing occurs terrence . he just opens new doors working outside track especially all new construction guys introduced lately like alfie jack . terrence lot fun our house he comes highly recommended	1

i agree complaints already written toy falling apart easily . also , sounds really annoying they get set off very easily . i just make batteries " die " when three screws became loose we take toy away until we could fix it . we looked everywhere screwdriver w/ triangle shape tighten them back into place , but haven't able find one . although my son asking frequently if toolbox fixed , he really much fun just using diecast vehicles themselves	-1

after reading reviews other parents stating this lego set " too much 7 year old " - well , i write something . this excellent very interactive set . age range 7-12 , so not mean you drop it lap your 7 year old miracles happen ! this set needs adult help younger kids , while my older kid put it together minutes ! it great features which make it more than just building , you play catapult-like games highly creative toys you just built - bed throws spongebob out it , 2 catapults firing play jellyfish , course , car interactive basketball hoop inside spongebob house . note parents kids 7-8 , you may actually need get down ground play your kids ! surprise ! older kids build this fairly easily seem invent lot games play their brothers/sisters . i give this set 5 stars because it combines challenge buliding legos , but more small creative gizmos play once set built . last comment people who complain legos fall apart need reassembled ... duh ! if you like play your 7-9 year old don't want use legos babysitter , this top lego set available price ! older kids , they get tremendous amount enjoyment ( provided they like spongebob )	1

this dora lego set generally high quality . my two year old likes play it -- especially dora boots figures . he little young put all it together himself , but he gets it out lot . my only negative would mat legos placed only made flimsy cardboard , but it not really essential set .	1
i not following technic series quite while but when i saw this i knew i get it . get it i . it might bit pricey , personally i don't like motorized pieces because uncertainty ( might go kaputt anytime ) , but this sure looker ! however it not all perfect , imho ; outriggers could made more powerful ( how so matter ) . turntable could geared . there could pair wheels ( imagine ) . there could suspension wheels . dummy steering wheel front looks rather ridiculous . but nonetheless this still master piece . what next , giant fire engine ? count me	1
4 kids , ages 2-8 , we least 3 or 4 bins these blocks . this size really nice because they easy handle build . finished product not come out tiny . this size nice also because it not small enough really choke hazard my 2 year old not so large my 8 year old feels like she playing baby toy . i said previous review , duplos absolutely most played-with toy this house . everyone enjoys them . possibilities endless when you million blocks ! when doubt , buy duplos ! no kid doesn't like them there no such thing too many . . . ** description says something gold blocks this set . i no idea what they're talking . we bought 2 our sets this listing here amazon i assure you we absolutely no gold blocks .	1
we got tub these legos two christmases ago our 2 daughters , then ages 1 3 . our only complaint even 140 pieces isn't enough ! we got tub next year , getting one again this year because they best toy our children ! we debated over whether get duplos again or try regular legos , but decided go ahead get one more tub duplos , because our now-5 yr . old still loves them . newer colors fun ( lego added orange , light green , light blue standard red , yellow , blue , green ) , well addition skinny blocks . definitely great buy kids ( grown-ups ) any age	1
this cute idea , but materials used make this cheap . if it weren't my daughter getting this her birthday friend , i wouldn't spent money it myself . it cheaply made falls apart easily . ropes hold swings , broke off within one day . my daughter loves this toy , gotten other sets go it . she plays it often , but isn't made well . babies homely , so tiny they hard dress . she loves it all same . she six her sister ten , they play it all time . i am hoping this toy continues grow new sets coming out , but i also hope assessories made better than this item	1
my husband i purchased this toy our 5 year christmas . we unfinished basement so we let him play this downstairs . ( it too cold play outside now . ) toy fun when it actually works . many times balls get stuck . it very frustrating constantly trying get them actually pop out . when they sometimes they too low hit . we haven't yet tried play t-ball it . it fairly light so it possible it may tip over many times . i find pieces pretty durable . my son continue play it but he often stops cause it gets frustrating . he sometimes just plays balls bat so it wasn't total loss	1
my brother-in-law loves geology ! he his early 30 we usually get some sort " gag gift " guys christmas , so i bought him this . he loved it ! i think he told me three times box rocks cool ! it size child shoe box i think there 6 geodes break . it hit	1
i've looking snap circuit sets several years now finally purchased sc-750 my daughters 9th birthday . i bit worried she too young it but found not case . she already built voice recorder , fm radio doorbell projects blast playing each them . projects really simple build ( i only helped first one ) following detailed instructions well marked components . she came home yesterday , her homework went right snap circuits began building project ( much better than watching tv ) . i look forward using computer interface so we actually learn ( together ) electronics . i suspect this one those rare toys not gather dust shelf .	1
please aware this not dvd use dvd player . it disc made only " read me dvd learning system " . this not clear item description my daughter tears when her birthday present wouldn't work . i felt really bad her feel mislead	-1
my son received read me dvd system all dvds early christmas present his uncle . after week this dvd dr. seuess one his two favorites . this dvd charming story curious george visiting chocolate factory . it fun game where kids make their own chocolate candy design machine . it also teaches new vocabulary . one part story teaches children what " curious " means so they understand why george his name . i like my son learning new words , listening entertaining story , enjoying himself same time . i would recommend this dvd purchased if someone wondering which ones series buy . it much better than some others .	1
i owned this doll over six months now . she wonderful condition . i'm not sure where start , because everything this doll takes my breath away ! i describe my doll you . lindsay lohan , popular actress singer , now beloved collector doll millions homes . i'd like start saying this doll not onlt resembles , but looks exactly like real lindsay lohan(before she died her hair blonde then brown ) . everything her looks like real lindsay lohan-from her long red hair , her freckles , her eyes , even her smile ! $30 wonderful bargain collectors doll so beautiful so much durability . her coat super soft , easy get . her dress beautiful . it flower pin . her extra outfit many possibilities . extra skirt may used dress , or it matched blouse , or it paired white shirt . all these options may used coat or wrap . top , there two pairs shoes choose . all clothes match , so you don't worry combination outfits looking weird . both shoes easy slide , but personally , i don't care pink shoes . they make lindsay feet look large pointed . but that only my opinion . lindsay amazing accessories . her director char red-carpet ropes look fabulous when display . all little accessories , i won't get into . they somewhat useful , but not so important . i would like describe one them . laptop cd drive opened . dvd cases then opened , dvd inside them may places into cd drive . nothing happen , course , but it great pretend . so , i recommend this doll ? most definately ! what not love ? ( ...	1
my 7-year old loves this . it tons extras very unique	1
i quite disappointed phone aspect this toy ( hippo game fine 3-year-old ) . entire number pad presses single unit makes random tone each press ( you cannot press different numbers individually ) . also , when you close flip phone , it doesn't hang up like real phone would , rather it keeps dialing/talking until it finishes its conversation . buttons outside phone merely decorative ( other than phone game switch ) . also it bit large child hand . positive : voices fairly realistic , not too annoying . hinge seems pretty sturdy , i expect it withstand quite bit abuse child	-1
if you put tracks carpet or even area rug i'd definitely get " sure tracks " hill , we problems trains getting stuck either before or after . however , if you train table , or any hard surface it not neccessity . battery-powered train nice though not super fast any means . also , switch top hard my son 2 1/2 turn off , front forward , middle off back backwards , kind tough get it middle off so when i tell him go turn his engine off if he going leave room , i help him or it myself . also invest some rechargable aaa batteries they only last day or two if they run lot . this mountain adventure set definitely " cute " factor going . love mountain/tunnel bears cave . all pieces seem high quality , even plastic mountain bridge .	1
all stories offered read me player all great classics . this one new one us , cameron enjoyed it . i think my son really enjoyed this story . someone also gave him hard back book his birthday , he loves this one . i think any read me dvd offered it great one . they either new or timeless classics they learn read , follow while they listen or play games relating story after . it makes learning fun . buy all them , we own them all . great concept i hope they offer more future . i think they just needed market it better during year before holidays .... awesome learning toy	1
our son ( 2-3/4 ) plays this over over . , putting pieces back into box much part game putting pieces together , so clean up not issue . who would thought 6 months playing 4 puzzles almost daily basis you would no missing pieces ! sturdy colorful well built ( other " melissa doug " products we've found ...	1
tonnes fun . comes booklet step step instructions solve puzzle , although it seems instructions might missing couple moves which makes it frustrating . i've playing it non-stop since i got it . it fun even after you solve it because it fun try improve your time i think it quite relaxing . it durable but edges stickers beginning peel . overall it great product i recommend it all ages	1
i bought this toy my son i figured if it turns out too ' girly ' i would give it my niece . it turned out , it definitely not adequae my son but it definitely more adequate my son than my niece ! it also gender neutral issues . let me give couple examples if i time one day i give more specifics : this toy sophisticated electronics but design behind it seems lacking . example , it give negative feedback choosing wrong answer but i not give any feedback if you chose right answer :-) toy designed encourage vanity other undesirable traits feels like it designed someone who sterotypical negative view what american girls like . more later got go .. probably designed some insensitive backward male out there .. my apologies all good guys out there . i know there lot you out there i am married one them :-)	-1
my son ( who just turned 2 ) received this christmas . he also received lot other thomas things . he enjoys playing it very much - we obviously teach him how connect traks build knapford station , thomas , etc ... it goes his other duplo blocks bonus his 5 year old sister also enjoys this toy . it doesn't very many " bells whistles " which why i didn't give it 5 stars , but he still enjoys it very much	1
i got this toy my 18 month old , who loves trains blocks . however , i found , much my chagrin , she insisted disassembling various lego items ( light , tunnel , station , trains .... ) . so , we could never really put set together more than 5 minutes . assembling elements also required following directions , so it wasn't really fun her play . i think this would great toy slightly older child , fact we gave ours friend who just over 2	1
this toy bit silly . my daughter likes roll balls floor , but it isn't nearly much fun some other pull-toys she . balls immediately fall off caterpillar when child pulls it , it isn't heavy enough even stay upright . it just sits toyshelf , looking cheesy . i'd recommend investing quality wooden pull-toy , instead . only great things it they didn't try jazz it up annoying flashing lights or terrible music ! reason alone , we didn't return it	-1
this toy wonderful addition roll round line , which up until this point consisted solely dinosaur , gumball machine turtle , so it certainly welcome addition . rounds come toy very cute , but not related toy they normally . instance , gumball machibe comes candy themed balls . still , rounds alwasy cute . toy itself , it very very cute . it easy pull or push or drag , moves around quite easily . only issue i it how easily balls fall out , whcih frustrates my child , i also believe pull string should bit easier hold . all all , great	1

i wrote this review product same company same applies this : we purchased item hoping it would reasonable size , meaning food would closer " real " size rather than miniature . it . we also hoped it would made well stand up hopefully more than one generation use . remains seen , but stuff made well i cannot see it breaking unless you deep-freeze plastic pieces hit them hammer . nice texture , nice flexibility , pretty realistic looks . child it intended ( age 4 bit ) plays happily it , even older boys ( 10 13 ) few moments goofy fun it	1

main reason why i purchased this set because red dragon . there very few red dragons released dragons building toy lines it bright color drew me . i no idea toy encased metal tin , which terrific convenience storage . many other pieces repaints previous dragons collections , but i never able purchase them time because mega bloks only one production run any set . arches staircase really make this piece stand out viewing front , but back really forgetable . catapult siege weapon bonus winged beast ( moment i cannot remember what they called ) nice touches . over all i would say it would fabulous starter set anyone getting into dragons	1
it even works wiffle balls ! i bought 4 pack dollar store . their weight much lighter than foam balls it comes so you'll adjust angle test distance base/hitter first . only problem using wiffle when it windy , wind picks it up quickly so we use original balls windy days	1

i bought this particular version pictionary because we playing same version many years , so i felt it time upgrade new materials , new items draw , ect . first thing i liked this version more portable box , which no more than 9 inches long . previous version i 24 inches long major eye soar . course , presentation isn't everything . i got it home , opened box , so pleased find more than adequate supply paper tablets write pencils . also , board shrunk just slightly portability . cards now include 20 phrase cards , which state phrases instead objects . also , there now option there more than 2 teams ( 5 if i am remembering correctly ) . quality game seems increased remarkably . said all , only major thing i dislike game , while it says it 3 or more players , extremely unenjoyable without 4 players . sometimes , one wants play pictionary because it very addicting game kids , teens , adults , but 3-person-pictionary lame use such well-thought game . i highly suggest buying this game . if you don't use it daily basis , it terrific addition parties family ge t-t ogethers -- almost necessity . kids love it because it allows you draw what you get your card , but since they children , sometimes they don't know what object card ; however , pictionary necessary addition any household	1

we purchased this puzzle our son when he 1 year old . now , one year later , he still enjoys playing it . this such wonderful starter puzzle because it teaches little ones pieces only fit one way . this seems so basic , but it lets them early success , which builds confidence doing more advanced puzzles later . also , chunky wood pieces easy small hands recognize , remove , grasp , manipulate . this puzzle not challenging our son anymore , but he really likes talking all vehicles , sounds they make , etc . like all melissa doug toys , this puzzle very well-made . one bonus this company if you lose or break piece , they'll replace it , usually no additional charge . that quality service !	1

we liked this toy got much use it over summer backyard my 2-year old son . accessories came it good . kids also used fisher-price little people made " water park " them table . plenty room imaginitive play this toy	1
i bought this item because i 2 kids , 3 18 mo . my 3 yr old fine kiddie pool , but i worried my little one . i figured this table would good him play water without worrying him falling :) my 3 yr old ended up loving it well . i even used it my unfinished basement when weather got too cold outside use . it great because you don't sand making mess out water portion like some tables . no complaints this product - very stable	1
this game lot fun . my kids ( 6 3 1/2 ) really like it both play it . it very fast-paced game similar slapjack , so it takes few times learn how play it , so it hard new player jump . kids love slap cards shout - it not quiet game . if you lose some cards , this game still very playable	1
i older version this game i use counseling/social skills groups elementary school . i am always looking games keep everyone engaged actively involved , slamwich fits bill perfectly . kids absolutely love it , especially when " sandwiches " disgusting ( e.g. , peanut butter onions ) . , even though game theoretically competitive ( player get all cards wins ) , kids usually enjoy game play so much they share their cards anyone who runs out . great fun , very entertaining	1
i'm not sure what other reviewers looking , but bottom line this product finger paint . it labeled finger paint , even though clear , it still paint product . it messy your fingers , like any finger paint , you should cover your surfaces- throw down some news paper or place-mat first . voila ! easy clean-up . said , i think it great product recommended age . my daughter started color wonder products 18 months . now , almost 3 , she actually enjoys them ( somewhat ) responsible them . we take marker sets everywhere : airplanes , restaurants , grandma house , stroller , etc . true , paint vaseline-like consistency , but traditional finger-paint like pudding anyway . color wonder finger paint clean up well , colors blend nicely create really interesting swirls colors ( think easter egg dyes ) provide hours fun age-appropriate child who handle waiting moment color appear . part fun anticipation magic picture show up . just try it , what could you lose	1
we moderate success color wonder markers , made next logical leap paints . don't it ! first all , your child start out digging their fingers all way into paint - it just human nature - so paints used up very fast . they'll empty little troughs within half hour . secondly , these paints almost messier than colored paints . these aren't hard-until-you-we t-t hem kinds paints you're used . these soft paints all way through , consistancy chapstick , just greasy . after rubbing paints all over paper , paper left heavy , greasy , transparent feel - days later , paper still not dry . weeks months later , paper still too disgusting pick up . yuck ! i agree prior reviews which site child lack creativity , etc ., but i think it okay just messy sometimes . said , this just too messy yucky deal . go get some water color pencils or better yet , stick grade-school acrylics	-1
i found item well made easy use . it clever idea my grandson enjoyed it lot . using amazon also plus , no crowds contend	1

my son loves cars collecting each matchbox type cars . he said he wanted mac , so i found this one on-line . i extremly disappointed truck , especially price . it cheap plastic trailer doesn't not click onto front truck . therefore , it pops right off all time . it would better if truck either one piece or would snap together so not fall apart slight touch .	-1

i think barbie looks fabulous her hot pink beach outfit ! it very hip trendy . my fave extra little bonuses come barbie like sunscreen ! i really appreciate barbie modest wearing lace beach cover-up ! this must low low price	1
i would never bought this item if i read other poor reviews first . toy made very cheap looking plastic it much smaller than it appears box . pieces just not fit like box displays them ( what appears large command center where transformer slide down wire just little over index finger long ) . i wish i could take it back but my son already broken couple cheap pieces . my 4-year old so disappointed because he could not stop talking how this would first toy he would play christmas day	-1
i purchased this item my six year old grandson . he i worked putting different projects together . different one each night . instructions seemed bit difficult him understand his own . it good quality time working together projects lot fun .	1
this item too difficult six year old even though advertised 5-8 year olds . you cannot return item once opened , so not order	-1
i would say while i think 7 bucks bit much my son constant play using this definitally put 7 bucks worth use into it i think . i agree they should included i also would like find one lego tables although someones suggestion fixing them board or something might just idea . my son used them build hotels or even makes his own " game grid " or mazes or even maps . he 7 i say he loves this thing i plan maybe getting him . i nearly forgot add while some people seen durability problems we haven't . it even stepped his older sister while it left faded green mark it not bend it or anything . it very durable us .	1

what you talking ??? im talking girl below me ... her " girls should stay home wives 15 " uh sorry . i dont like barbies now ... i really dont anything against them ... um this doll looks cute . i wouldnt buy it though . i recommend bratz if you're into kind style ^__	1
my daughter received these her 1st birthday . she loved them immediately , particularly enjoyed bucket they came . she would fill empty bucket , over over again , putting lid , taking it back off , trying other toys see if they fit ( your ball too big ! but look , block fits inside ! ) , putting beads into other containers ... you get picture . she learned lot these beads . now , 15 months , she just started able snap them together , getting whole new experience them . these one first toys she pulls out her play bin every day , they get played throughout day until it time put toys bed . while i agree these beads heavy , i find they stay together without problem ( but aren't hard her pull apart , either ) . me , they feel like good quality toys , you won't find them denting easily like cheaper snap-beads . i highly recommend this toy toddler	1
booooo . not fun , don't waste your money this one . talk disappointment . i searched cool tub toys so long thought sure i winner . nope ! 1)the little clown head doesn't stay . 2)the beach ball you squeeze make water run down slide , simply doesn't provide enough umph get water really going 3 ) slide keeps falling off 4 ) suction cups don't hold really well . i took slide off now we just pour water into cup top call it day	-1

this game easy learn strategy develops longer you play . it doesn't take very long play growing potential expansions	1
when i first read description carcassonne , i dismissed it something i wouldn't really enjoy ( i've never really liked how luck dominant element tile-laying games ) . but there so many fantastic reviews mentioned how `strategic ' it , we decided dig into our game fund buy it ! it instant hit family friends including my wife daughter , who not avid game players . i won't waste time explaining rules or details gameplay , but i say learning game very easy . game plays half hour ( bit more expansions ) , which great because people come go they please - no long term commitments here . even adding `the river ' ( included basic game edition we bought ) `inns cathedrals ' expansion rules isn't burden . only area bit confusing scoring farmlands . we it incorrectly first night , but i re-reading rules clarify it , it became clear how they should scored . mechanics gameplay tinkered produce variations you may like . instance , we don't use standard rules placing river tiles beginning game . we shuffle all 12 tiles , picking laying tiles build river only until two ends ( spring lake ) placed . this way , length river ( 2 12 tiles ) varies one game next . tile laying aspect this game , course , mostly luck . there no strategy give you tile you need - you'll either lucky or not . one game , my son i both waiting finish cities near end game , needing identical pieces . he drew tile scored , i ended up zero city lost game . i drawn tile , i'd won . course , more players you , less chance you getting tile you really need . placing tiles carefully key strategizing . should you build bunch small cities , or lesser amount large ones ? should you finish road or try build it long possible ? should you expand your own farms , roads , cities , or `steal ' points player ? there no one strategy fail-safe ( least none i've found ) . strategy comes not only where tiles places , but also placement your followers (`meeples ' ) score points roads ( thieves ) , farms ( farmers ) , cloisters ( monks ) cities ( knights ) . since you only small amount meeples , so managing them wisely utmost importance . . when it all put together , these elements combine make fun unpredictable game different every time you play it . we purchased " inns cathedrals " expansion , which inns double value roads cathedrals score you additional points cities . but if those cities roads remain unfinished end game , whole city ( or road ) worthless ! this set also comes large follower ( worth 2 regular followers ) each color , complete set followers sixth color ( gray ) , `50/100 ' tiles make keeping score easier . there several other expansions carcassone , each adding twist here or there , well increasing number tiles . we hope add some those our collection over time , but we don't really find game lacking anything way it , either . while these expansions aren't necessary enjoy game , additional tiles , rules , strategies really modify game up nicely . there also `big box ' available which includes base game plus five expansions . i recommend this game highly . while i can't say it replace game nights taking out large board game 2-3 hour showdown , this game stands its ' own merits , fine game 2 5 players ( six i expansion ) . but more importantly , it kind game entice non-gamers into fold , every person i introduced game ( both gamers non-gamers alike ) loves it . carcassonne proof game doesn't massive or highly technical rules challenging fun .	1
my family i all love board games bought this after reading great reviews . it lived up all expectations . my husband read instructions easily explained game us . strategies quickly realized but varied . game different every time played under hour . this game comes free " river " expansion pack so you play or without . i like river better . game most fun two players , but we've played up four still good time . strategy changes more people	1

geeze what you expect ? yes it $100 toy capable flight means it going light delicate . but make no mistake : it amazing toy - flat out impossible when i young . so care , realize what you're buying fun .	1
while i'm not big fan " deal or no deal " , i seen show understand why it overwhelming success nbc . game brilliant yet simple , fun watch . however , its even more fun play this handheld version not disappoint . even though unit comes instructions , interface very simple operate most users won't even need consult them . " old-school " lcd game , graphics sound obviously very simple , yet adequate enough convey all excitement dond . gameplay presentation well you need not fan show become addicted . this one most entertaining handheld games i ever owned ! my gripes product mostly minor . on/off button not responsive times , but unit automatically power down after five minutes idle time anyway . while batteries included , they disc-type ( lr-44 ) instead standard aa or aaa . aside these two insignificant issues , this product very enjoyable ... i'm admittedly not big fan dond . i only imagine how much more exciting it would someone who fan hit game show	1
we got this our son third birthday . he knows dinosaurs ' real names he his older sister play these hours ! i love how they sized they their own storage bin ... except throwing away boulders , which fit neatly into three year old mouth also kill your feet when stepped , we enjoyed everything this toy ! well worth money , very much recommended , i already told 5 other mothers them !	1
my 4 year old recently experienced " dinosaur month " daycare teacher bunch larger scale dinosaurs my daughter fell love . i couldn't find anything comparable any stores , so i took chance purchasing this item . i'm glad i they very comparable dinosaurs daycare . they look real very durable . it comes mat well plastic mountains , trees rocks so it allows her imagination go beyond just dinosaurs . i'm very pleased this purchase	1

sequence game i've playing over decade , am still loving it . friend introduced it my family during vacation when i teen . following christmas , both my mom i unknowingly happened give it each other gifts . we love gave so much we kept both them . i'm glad because i've able keep mine me i've moved around . now married , my wife become hooked we play all time . we live south america now introduced it friends we've made here . we literally get phone calls asking if we come over bring sequence us . it great because it so fun , easy learn , there no language barrier . i standard edition , so i don't know too much deluxe or jumber editions . but through years much i've played , folding board still great condition . also , i've read other reviews chips deluxe version painted white bottom easily show where sequences made . you if you want , but me , part strategy not let your opponent(s ) know you've already made sequence . if they don't see it , makes it easier you get your second one . so i think standard version just fine way it	1
we love this game .. it great ages 10 up .. nice family game include many people !!... concentrate entire board !! challening fun !	1
we've playing this game my family few years now we all love it ! it addictive ! we play prizes which makes it even more fun exciting . we players/teams age 12 up 80 years	1

i 1 year old girl 2 year old boy both them love this toy ! my youngest loves sounds it makes my oldest loves changing tiles over reveal new piece puzzle . they don't understand how make new picture ( flipping tiles until you get matching piece puzzle . there 3 puzzles ) but come time . it keeps them busy car which great , its educational because its puzzle , but it doesn't lots pieces would get lost . i think it totally worth money great itea !	1
i bought this toy my son when he 7 months old , he loved it ! it still his favorite toy - he 12 months old now . he used crawl over it pull himself up . now he walking , he make beeline it whenever he sees it . he loves little spot under cookie monster , he likes hide things there . he also likes press buttons front dance music . i found it pretty sturdy , since all chewing , pulling , banging , etc . haven't broken it yet . he now starting try climb top it , which problem , because it tip over . other issue sound really annoying . maybe it i hear it so much during day , but whole " eyes ! they help us see our friends " thing echoing my head while i try sleep . there off switch sound , but then my son gets sad elmo isn't talking him . overall , great toy	1
my child loved this toy . my only problem it , it tipped over easy . so i just set back up against wall or something kept eye my child .	1
since matchbox now mattel item , these same 24 car hot wheels cases found target every other year ( it seems ) . these far superior what hot wheels line right now . they " throw back " design black wheel they dreaded 100 car case wheels . both those allow cars bang around hard sides scratch them . these classic soft trays stack . even couple slots longer cars . exception ebay , this only place i've found this type case . excellent your redlines or latest pegs	1
yes , case itself made generric flimsy plastic they used make halloween costumes out back 80 . however , so far , i not any durability issues it . big selling point me , though , it included two plastic trays put cars . i first got hot wheels car carrier made solid plastic , but it not hold cars securely while carrying case , cars would move around inside scrape each other up . removable divider trays this case perfect not allow cars move all , even if you tip case upside down . i highly recommend this portable case	1
so we just got this gift christmas our 8 year old . took me almost 10 minutes get it " lick .

excellent game . i not want get console game system my son because i knew i'd never see him again . this game however gets him up moving .

my son this toy almost year used crayons every day since he got them . they still 1/2 their original size ! i really surprised some reviewers who said their crayons melting away fast because i amazed durability ours . maybe they haven't letting them dry out baths ?? my son no problem getting them out little fishbowl . only bad thing i say although my son loves elmo doll hasn't really captured his attention , i'm absolutely sure that just personality issue him . doll great shape , still looks like it when we first got it .	1
i don't know if this happened using hook hang dry elmo , but now his neck ripped half way around stuffing falling out . we using this toy 5 months , since my daughter got it christmas gift . she really enjoyed crayons even coloring elmo . crayons still holding up haven't worn down fast other reviewers said . she draw our bathroom wall , though , which not too pleasant side effect tub crayons . we plastic tub crayons not problem far staining goes . overall it nice while it lasted	-1

i love this new edition clue jr. it actually looks like clue now . my 5 year old little slow strategy , but she might better playing against kids her own age instead her older sister her parents . :) easy set up , no shuffling cards , you put each characters " stand " different time bottom it put different things room ( like plant or pool table ) stand beverage bottom it . extra time beverage stands go middle you try figure out what they . no one character so you move anyone around rooms making it more equal everyone . you don't hold any cards your hands so its easier kids keep track . still comes clue sheets places mark off what you find out .	1
finally i found clue junior version original clue atmosphere ! this version comes famous clue suspects classic looking board differnt rooms . it perfect game get my five year old daughter ready original clue she so curious	1

i purchased this snake my son 6th birthday . i am very dissapointed this item . starters , snake not move very easily . you make sure you only hardwood , even then , it somewhat difficult control . remote control very long antenna , which kids very careful . it unusually long such small remote toy ! also , second night he it , snake broke . we already problems last joint snake coming off . not big deal , it snaps back . but he playing this snake , it actually came apart . now , it only held together wires . my husband trying repair it . i saw toy break , our son wasn't rough it , it just very very poorly made . it not worth money buy . i feel i should come up birthday present our son , since this one barely lasted past his special day !	-1

mace windu legendary lightsaber unique due its purple crystals/blade . subsequently , one first force fx sabers i sought out master replicas this one . appearance elegant hilt not disappoint . one older force fx sabers , it slightly heavier/bulkier than newer ones , it takes 6 aa batteries instead 3 aa or 3 aaa newer ones . unlike typical blue , green or red force fx lightsabers , color not striking because they not use purple led lights . perhaps future , newer model , sleeker , lighter , brighter , purple leds made ... sound effects adequate , perhaps not sharp/crisp newer sabers . polycarbonate blade sturdy , good enough light-duty dueling . nevertheless , this one more unique designs ( master replicas often chided coming out sabers too similar design ) , entire line force fx sabers not really disappoint . star wars fans , force fx saber must your inner jedi ..	1
i've this dual disk more than year , this what i say : 1 . if you going play this item , you'd better make sure your friends one , otherwise it not much fun yourself . 2 . many people complain you cannot put cards protectors into slots , but you realize this would make it hard regular cards played . 3 . many item descriptions call this " dual disk launcher " " launches your cards . " i tell you right now this item not launch your cards , but it fold outwards " standby " dual mode , which might what they referring . 4 . people say your cards get bent , but not if you play them carefully . pros : ~ fun play friend who one ~ just like show ! ~ hold just all different types cards ~ it folds outwards into battle position ~ it life point countercons : ~ graveyard slot not hold very much cards i find myself haveing empty it place those cards aside while i refill it ~ graveyard slot very slightly too skinny fit width your yu-gi-oh cards , so cards get bent while they're it , but they come out fine end ~ dual disk " standby mode " not very compact : two halves hang out very far annoying . plus , it looks little silly standby , battle mode cool ( show 2 halves retract slightly , then extend out fold together) ~ deck zone doesn't hold ton cards , but if your deck reasonable size , not too big , it should fit just fine . overall , i am very pleased toy , i think some people critisized it little too much . it not easy make this sort thing into toy , i'm surprised mattel even it ( still it look cool ) . just remember either you'll want get 2 , or make sure your friend one , because these no fun themselves	1

i am 37-year-old artist mother 4-year-old . i , too , remember original , truly classic spirograph product -- originally manufactured kenner ( which part problem its current iteration , i suspect ) . call this current model " deluxe " cruel joke . i would recommend klutz product ( relatively new company sterling reputation quality , way ) instead . " spiral draw book " doug stillinger ( published klutz available through amazon.com)is not nearly elaborate old spirograph , all its cool , gimmicky-shaped gears . $19.95 , klutz product certainly more expensive -- but it works !! klutz says it " not intended children under 8 years " . my 4-year-old daughter require sustained assistance it , but she * loves * it . i , too !! marketing geniuses hasbro should pull their heads out their collective rear end tap into huge market nostalgia-tripping parents ( grandparents ) made up discriminating people like ourselves . if you still insatiable jones late-60s kenner original , go ebay !! you'll need deep pockets first-edition or " mint-in-box " versions , but you pick it up pretty cheap if all you want something original parts works .	-1

" important note ! " i not this gun . i am rating my research !!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
i no idea how this gun worked before i got it , but figured since it could fire 20 darts it would decent . it pretty good gun , it uses two spinning plastic discs hurl darts forward . problem this , it isn't always accurate , depending how dart gets ejected into them , also it kind loud when it . but you fire 20 darts within few seconds , still makes it very fun . i've already lost 2 darts though , only emptied clip few times . now i need find refills someplace	1

our family thrilled operation this toy ... it most interesting toy ( imaginext , k'nex , hot wheels ) we constructed so far . we got this toy markdown toy store , concluded it best deal we've ever gotten . construction : my 8 year old son needed little help build this , which 10 year old sister unable provide ( too hard find mistake , she not good spacial skills little bro ) . good spacial skills required , so recommended older kids and/or experienced builders . oversight : it took little parent correction complicated build ( checking firm clicking good angles ) tweaking ramp heights get this working perfectly feeling surprisingly stable . instructions fully detailed drawings steps , fairly easy follow , but little difficult tell orange red ( deducible length ) . operation : run three tubers fascinating watch ( least hour ... ' til bedtime ) . there only one ramp not quite enough slope * always * get tuber down , but he goes off himself ; occasional flips tubers upright bottom pool before lift helpful but not required ( 25% time ) . less than 10% time tuber flip cause tuber run off ramp . we've 2.5 hours operation without mishap ( once we tightened lift belt lift sticks ) so far , looking forward trying alternate build . we very impressed engineering ; particularly since we'd build our own machines scratch class assignments , kids know how hard it plan something actually works . reliability : cannot yet speak reliability , we haven't yet encountered problem . missing parts : unsure whether parts missing , or whether kids just lost two rods when tearing open packages . we able find same length color rods our other k'nex sets , there some " leftover " /replacement parts most pieces -- particularly unique pieces	1
i am 14 i could this very easily it worked great i reccomend it everyon	1
this premature overly ambitious design . my 7 year old gifted builder , worked several k'nex building models easily , begged something more challenging . when i bought this most expensive supposedly most advanced model toysrus , i expected it would give fun not only building , but also motorized operation box claimed . i totally disappointed . whole system appeared weak shaky , sliding connections not smooth , riders get easily stuck anywhere , or fall off . it not broken yet , but it never operate full round without some manual assistance . system also looks cheap clumsy . it now occupies big corner room , waiting disembled . we leave it there few more days , only sooth boy remorse his effort building it . my recommendation , buy it only if your life overwhelmingly happy , so you need balance it spending $80 buy few days frustration	-1
i bought this toy my baby , it his first birthday . my son played toy , he loved toy . i loved this toy , until ears stopped working . we only toy 3 weeks when they stopped moving . toy still music/voice working . but it isn't same out ears moving . he doesn't like it anymore . i don't packaging anymore send it back . i wished it still worked .	-1

great thinking game " think fun " . i belong homeschool " strategy labs " group , which run former gifted talented public school teacher , she introduced me think fun games . my children thoroughly enjoy them , more patience than i would expected try solve puzzles . previous reviewer said this game good " gifted " children , i'm sure it , but i think it great game any child who likes solve puzzles , regardless their giftedness them . i would even buy this game ( or perhaps river crossing jr , or rush hour ) child who doesn't particularly like puzzles , because some adult encouragement , child may really enjoy it ( thus learning he/she like puzzles ) improve his ability think visually plan several moves ahead - quite nice bonus .	1
i received this game christmas , i hadn't even asked it . i absolutely love it . game consists main puzzle tray , plastic stumps , little magnetic man , 5 magnetic plastic boards different sizes , 40 puzzle cards ( ranging difficulty ) , carrying bag store everything ( which comes handy ! ) . this game really gets you thinking , you actually find yourself thinking ahead many moves . object game get little man one side river , other . you so , moving planks stump stump . sometimes you drop plank off convenient location , just pick it up later when you need it . i started playing it couldn't stop ! once you start getting hang it , you find yourself wanting continue you figure out easier puzzles . i must say , they become more difficult , you really need think ahead looking pieces you need towards " end " crossing . don't drag boards you don't need ( don't drop them places hinder your crossing ! ) . i definitely recommend this game people who enjoy puzzles , or games general . harder puzzles may too difficult younger child enjoy , they may get bored it . also- there many small parts could choking hazard small children . make sure you keep parts bag , keep it out reach	1

my eldest daughter received this gift when she month old . after four years love , use abuse , it finally wore out . let me tell you , three bedtimes it took get new one delivered very rough . if it not really dark her room ( like naptime , when sun peeks around her blinds lets little light ) , projected images harder see . when battery starts die , we see same thing - light isn't bright , images hard see . we also set it bookshelf ( 4 feet tall ) get brighter images . they aren't bright when low surface , like nightstand . what i think finally killed our first one , we would often overwind music box - point where inner mechanism would make awful clacking noise because it refused wind any more . although 4 years twice daily use pretty good run , we obviously trying bit more gentle this one , so we don't make emergency order when she turns eight	1
while playing this game first time , using less than one quarter supplied cards , our family found four cards incorrect answers . example , one card claimed grand prix races take place not road but oval track . claimed radar , not sonar , uses sound waves detect objects . spelled ebola virus quot ; boliquot ; . fourth card answer correct , but not only correct answer , claimed . makers this game would well hire fact checker	-1

this cute toy many small accessories not mentioned product description . each doll blanket , toothbrush pillow well mask coordinates her pajamas . there little dvds popcorn , cookies , soda , cups ( only three cups five dolls , though ) . if you three year old like i , cute accessories get lost within hour . these dolls not brushes their hair gets very frizzy quickly . shoes mule style fall right off . it might not easy tell racial variety dolls picture , but all but one white , other ambiguous race . living ethnically diverse community , i found this disappointing . all all , it very cute set many accessories it very good buy . forewarned very heavily packaged you spend least half hour freeing dolls accessories box . i would say this would more accurately 5+ instead 3	1

my toddler son loves anything wiggles thus , this dish set his favorite . he follows me into kitchen all time asking " where go-go ? " ( he calls wiggles " go-go's!)and just likes looking dishes ! i limit use them sometimes because often he'll just dump out plate or bowl just look wiggles ! cup also good helping encourage my son transition lid-less cup learn how drink something other than sippy cup . one draw back , though , set no matching flatware . i know you use any flatware , but matching set would also help encourage some toddlers learn use fork/spoon , too . anyway , must-have set die-hard fans !	1
i bought this my daughter christmas 06 ' she loves it .. it cute works great	1
we bought this jeep our daughter third birthday , after reading all reviews here , i very excited . it so easy put together took me hour assemble due many small pieces . my daughter little intimidated first , but after few minutes , she zipping around yard patio . ( still needs some work steering part) !! only two things i would work , 1 . flower decals lights little difficult peel off shift inconvient place . other than , it great !!! i would definetly get second battery so kids play longer periods time . but well worth small investment !!	1

i love this book , especially working pre-schoolers who typically struggling concept sharing - crayons toys snacks . i disagree some other reviews . rainbow fish loses friends first because he vain , snobbish rude because he thinks he most beautiful fish sea ( based upon external shiny scales ) . when he gives away most his scales , he learns greater happiness comes giving friendship than beautiful possessions ( scales ) . i especially like large version book which makes it easier share it groups kids .	1
give this ' book ' child should considered abuse . communist propogranda disguised innocent book fish .	-1
this best pirate ship i've seen . everything it speaks volumes great craftsmanship quality . this set includes everything you need pirate adventure , more . there quite bit assembly required . set aside couple hours , least . boat goes together extremely well . every part works like it supposed , they all fit together easily . result great-looking ship two masts , four sails , opening aft cabin , working winch intricately designed pully system . aft cabin features bed , table , benches . there also some room store some myriad accessories . staircase ascends main deck , ascends deck above cabin , where steering collumn . large grates floor deck open up , offering access ship hold . ladders ascend sides boat , offering our crew way get crow nest . there also optional weight attached bottom boat so it float water . i mixed feelings rigging sails . there lot it . fun string ! trying tie knots string isn't exactly my idea fun . ship didn't look bad without it . taken time assemble it , i say it probably worth effort . it certainly doesn't detract ship appeal . there rigging holds mainsails steady , string connects masts , one steadying forward sail . string also used winch anchor . assembling it all time consuming , but result pretty impressive . our swashbuckling crew three guys female pirate , latter which i find very appealing . how many pirate sets woman board ? all figures top-notch quality , although articulation leaves bit desired . straight arms only move back forth ( i think it would look more natural if their arms bent bit elbows ) . stiff legs move one . heads move left right , so wrists . figures all look great . their hats stay their heads . they also cowls , belts hold cutlasses or other items , cuff-links , neckwear . detail these guys great . now , here where this toy really sets itself apart rest . i've always fondness accessories . tools , weapons , animal friends ... stuff figures interact . well , there more accessories here than i know what ! sheer volume cool stuff here amazing . cutlasses , swords , rifles , pistols , knives , harpoon , barrels , baskets , serving tray , jugs wine , goblets , lantern , shovel pickaxe , spyglasses , accordion ... there varity fruit ! sack flour . treasure chest ( it nice locking mechanism ) . two manual-firing cannons plenty cannon balls . there more cannon balls here than i know what ! racks storing cannon balls . parrot . monkey . chicken coup three hens ! wow ! four rats . this impressive array accessories . my verdict : thumbs way , way up . they awesome job designing this ship outfitting it great crew loads accessories . i feel like i'm looking toy designer magnum opus . takes while assemble sort out all cool stuff , but it more than worth effort , definitely worth price admission	1
this toy classic ! i first got this ship when i 9 . i'm 28 now , would just much fun it now i then !! i plan building entire pirate kingdom very soon . playmobile tops my book . i wouldnt really recommend it kids , though , they might get cannon ball jammed up their nose or sumpthin'!	1
this very cute cd player , but after i read " toxic " waring electrical cord wash your hands after handling it cause reproductive harm -- we returned ours . i don't understand why they would make such product children use ??	-1

lots lots honeypots one first leappad books my son received , so it clocked good many hours play . story straightforward , easy young preschoolers grasp . although , it games really occupy my boy . there loads praise right answers , repeat question when answered incorrectly . i like this aspect play , it encourages learning . activities challenge children listen instruction , recognize items , follow through touching pictures pages . it difficult get 3-year old listen any great length time , but this toy promotes listening , focus . alone deserves decent rating me . i recommend this book children 3 up , but caution parents it may require some supervision . go button must touched every time you turn page , so leappad identify page . this alone may cause frustration . pages sturdy ; yet , little ones may get over anxious crinkle pages , or worse , tare them off binding . i've repaired few pages tape , but it not desirable . i don't any complaints lots lots honeypots ; however , i've discerned over 6-months time these books mastered quickly . if there more pages per books progressive learning i wouldn't cringe so much price tag . overall , i'm satisfied content this book . i recommend it young children who haven't mastered counting 10 .	1
nice book it keeps my little boy keeps busy following story game	1
bath time my son favorite part day . this product actully made him throw tantrum because he so frustrated . something i've never seen during bath time or art time ! basically paint doesn't adhere any surface wet . sponges work if parent carfully applies paint straight tube presses it part bath hasn't gotten wet . however , my three year old son could only get blob color if anything all . i would take this product back , but it given us family member . i think i'm going put it arts crafts area away bath . i'm sure it work better away water . this first review i've ever written . i wanted share my experience so others save thier money	-1

i originally bought this my 12 year old son , but after starting it him then putting him bed , my wife i ended up drinking bottle wine putting rest it together while planning our future travels far off places like tanzania thailand . fun educational , even adults . course hardest part remembering which part before adults took over so i could return puzzle incomplete state my son left it . he working it now ... no wine though . overall great educational enjoyable purchase	1
i got this game my wife x-mas . my family excited play it evening . game excruciating play . we average snl viewers seen most episodes some point time ( there reruns everyday ) , but questions too difficult . you would watch show 12 hours day take detailed notes get most questions righ t.t he dvd only plays few questions each catagory so when you use up questions it refers you back written questions . lastly dvd plays same few snl theme notes over over again . we pause game make it stop . we returned game following day	1
my boys ages 6 3 love this book . it different there deck cards included inserted back book then child learn different facts different dinosaurs ... ie ... how fast ... when he exist ... how much he eat . they love this part , " runs fast chicken " " big elephant " it allows them make comparison something they know	1
we bought this our 4 year old son who loves dinosaurs . this very entertaining educational book . my son enjoys different pages fun facts games . last page culminating activity using 16 interactive dinosaur cards . we love this ! after learning each dinosaurs he play game where he improve his amp ; amp ; quot ; titleamp ; amp ; quot ; carefully deciding whether he should make friends other dinosaurs or fight other dinosaurs . this far one best leap pad books .	1
all but two pages book work just fine even if all cards missing . it might best if reviews based actual experience not assumptions made people who " almost bought book	1
my son received this xmas when he 18 mos loves it . we keep it his crib he always playing it . he wont go sleep unless he hears his elephant	1
this product very difficult set up due vague instructions . i struggled hour then after reading reviews online i discovered tip hooking it together prior inflating which makes all difference . you also understand how brackets work pushing them through past hard plastic piece then rotating 90 degrees . if hooks aren't properly place bed won't set up correctly . once set up , my 22 mo . old loves it , but even lots bedding she gets very cold which common problem all airbeds . surface always very cold touch we keep our house temp 74f . after her 1st 45 minute nap she woke up purple lips shivering . we lay lots blankets bottom top her , even though her crib she only needed bottom sheet one snuggle blankie . we also roll up few blankets mattress sides due 6 " gaps which small chid could get wedged into while sleeping possibly suffocate . it warning pkg not used under 3yrs age . now we'll make it work because she loves it so much would heartbroken if we took it down	1
we purchased this bed intention using it vacations , sleepovers etc . however , we soon came realize setting this bed up no easy feat . it comes four seperate inflatable pieces . you need first assemble footboard headboard which fitting plastic pieces into each other turning them . only problem they keep falling out . battery operated ( 4 cell batteries ) pump included painstakingly slow . even electric pump which we used , there many different air chambers need filled it quite time consuming . this bed not set up minutes they claim far taking it apart , fit it back storage bag you need completley deflate it . i would not recommend this bed somebody looking travel bed . we ended up returning it	-1
i think this toy not educational all . it way over priced it breaks really fast . it usless toy thjat expensive buy but cheap when it comes playing it . i bought one my little sister christmas two day after she playing it , it broke so i thought ok maybe she it so i took it told them whant happened then i got anonther one her then next day it broke so it really cheap toy my eyes . you might say ooh .... your sister too young playing it well my sister 14 years old . so my review pottery wheel	-1
while i wouldn't expect professional quality wheel child starter toy , i would expect wheel powerful enough least turn . even my daughter 7 year old hands well wetted lump clay proved too much resistance this wheel . it kept stopping dead slightest touch . lack power frustrating any child , making balanced bowl impossible . kids would better form bowls hand . we took this toy back	-1
easy bake oven great , i want career baking cooking , so this really helped . my little sister loves it well	1
grandma purchased this monkey my daughter her 1st birthday . it instant favorite she doesn't travel anywhere without it . i love when she put it down somehwere can't remember where it . she'll walk around house saying " monkey ... where aaaaare yoooouuu ??? " my daughter likes sucking tail so he get rather nasty smelly but luckily he washes really well stays relatively soft . monkey goes everywhere us , i thought one necessity . i accidentally got large version dangles when i pulled him out box handed it her , she stared it , picked up real monkey walked off . ( mommy think she could pull one over me ?? i think not ! ) so , since large monkey won't , i'm buying real monkey ... just case . i gave dangles 5 stars cause i know how much she loves him how happy secure he makes her feel . definitely worth 5 stars my book	1
i haven't any problems these ball pit balls . they very soft , which i like safety reasons . very brightly colored seem hold there shape very well . we haven't any them crush or dent . instructions say if they dent , place them hot water they should return their original shape . we're glad we purchased these . only reason they only got 4 stars because price . $19.99 too steep price , expecially considering 100 balls doesn't go very far . we bought 200 balls it doesn't even cover bottom our small ball pit . you definitely need lot balls make fun play . 100 seems like lot , but don't fooled . it not many you think ... toys us 100 balls $9.99 , which much more reasonable price , but i haven't purchased any yet , so don't know what they like ..	1
this game definitely amusing one play amongst group friends . buzzer adds perfect obnoxious factor arguing over tweaks rules trying get people get your point leads some very funny moments	1
though product says blocks suitable babies young 6-months , keep mind they talking how safe they ! not necessarily kid like them early ! ( they may they may not . ) i bought different set 6 blocks my daughter because * i * found them adorable . beginning , she just wasn't feeling them . even when she old enough hold examine them , i think i found them more interesting than she ! but ... after putting blocks out sight while , then pulling them back out , she much more love them ! remember kids develop different stages , not mention , they little humans simply different tastes interests ! my advice : don't write these blocks off not very good simply because your child doesn't like them . start one small set ( re)introduce it your child intervals . after age 12-18-months , they may into them whole lot more	1
i easily put this house together . it looks good kids love it . staircase not used becasue it keept falling off . very worth price .	1
my daughter asking large dollhouse since she 4 but we waited until we knew she would able take care it use it properly . we finally decided this dollhouse when we got it we found thing made cardboard particle board very few actual braces made real wood . there isn't enough hardware keep thing together it broke almost immediately despite very gentle use my mature seven-soon eight- year old . she devastated . i found much better dollhouse imaginarium almost same price this . me extra 10.00 worth it knowing my daughter dollhouse she actually use . please don't buy this dollhouse , you dissapointed . instead check out glitter dreams dollhouse or uptown dollhouse both imaginarium	-1

game , spelling primer , spelling practice " free all , " this overall good value money ( shop around : $5 - $15 range out there ) . couple big downsides when using letter cubes anything other than supplied cards : 1 ) many simple words cannot formed because needed letters same cube , 2 ) all letters not represented ( not " cool " when your child can't even spell out his own name ) , very limited 3 4 word cards ( trim 3x5 index cards supply your own cards , but make sure word spelled provided blocks ! ) it would nice additional letter cubes available , especially all letters !	1
my 2.5 year old son our 4 year old neighbor played this game almost thirty minutes tonight . i think long time young children . yes it teaching tool needs parent involvement , no , there no snazzy sound effects or anything fancy this game . it brain work , plain simple , good children . if you excited children follow your example blast ! our children jumped up down hugged each other every time they got word correct they worked together helping each other find letters . competition fun , but not needed good time learn . if you want help your child improve their reading skills or get jump start reading , this wonderful tool it way teach children learning fun .	1

i am 18 recieved this set christmas .. believe me .. this not fragile toy if built correctly .. although i don't really approve way lego company decided attach forward rear ' round ' segments . landing gear , yes , they fragile indeed . but if you big hands like i , you should no problem getting them back . all i hold whole bottom ship , grey section ( imo : center weight ) bottom my palm . it took me all hour get this thing built displayed . i like this one so much more then original lego released . escape pod more ... realistic ? occupants not going die oxygen starvation . it lot more parts then original . i think it cool way if correctly , you effectivly take whole ship split it two .. if you jedi minifigures .. you use space assembly above boarding ramp ( grey 6x4 plate comes off reveal space just big enough 3 or 4 lightsabers)i love this set	1
i think this best lego set your toy store thank you	1
if you love trivia james bond films , this dvd game younote this game before daniel craig became new bond . so i guess you stuck just five bond already out there . this dvd game hard trivia game even truest bond film fans . it game you not need board , you just play it dvd . it great just one or group . . you know before you watch bond film friend , round scene it would great bit enjoyment . this game good 8 89 this game fun , just totally funbennet pomerantz audioworl	1
this lightsaber really look feel like " real thing " . it wows everyone who sees it . it quality realism actually match my vader costume much better than popular $9 saber you see everywhere . my only complaint mechanism detects motion seems lag quite bit , sound effects often several seconds behind your action , sometimes coming after motion already stopped . still , if you $100 spend really cool toy you would killed when you 8 years old , go it !	1
ever since i first saw luke power up his first lightsaber episode iv , i knew i wanted one my very own . this replica closest i'll ever come , i say , it well worth my money . my brother , sister i each one , we're all very pleased them . craftmanship remarkable these things ! they all made metal some plastic rubber very high quality . this anakin skywalker replica feels very solid my hand--it same weight mace windu slightly lighter than single darth maul blade , but anakin feels most comfortable my hand ( not say others all uncomfortable though ) . we dueling ( carefully ) blades lately , they held up surprisingly well some fairly solid clashes . however , manual clearly states these not designed dueling , nor they toys . what they cool hell . side note , blue red sabers shine much more vibrantly than purple , all blades look much better low lighting conditions .	1
anakin skywalker ep . iii fx lightsaber essential star wars collector . lightsaber butt end handle tip blade very well made . blade made very durable plastic handle alumium(forgive misspelling ) . powered aa batteries , lifespan one set batteries impressive length . sound effects great , i love power-up power-down feature , which incorprated light sound . although , this patictular lightsaber birthday gift , i own three fx lightsabers myself . i am impressed satisfied all them . thank you	1
i love this game i hate sing , how ironic !!! only bad thing timer allows 20 seconds only , we bought minute timer make game little longe	1
okay , these games cheap but not excuse how bad they . xmas my wife bought me two titles endless games ( family feud deluxe encore ) . both horrible . it seems if people endless games skimped everything possible keep game cheap produce possible . instructions appear written 13 year old . i would not recommend either these anyone would instead spend few extra bucks get game some thought behind it	-1
it looks really cute , im saving it x-mas though . polly her friends going love sleigh . pieces small so if you little ones careful . my daughter just getting into them . because small pieces her brother getting older . so she it now good price it free shipping rock	1
i'm gearing this review mostly people who grew up transformers 1980 would either like relive their memories or introduce their kids same things they enjoyed . if you're not familar original bumblebee character or toy , then nutshell i'll say " yes , it cool , your kids like it ! " okay , now old school fans ... reviewer mentions , volkswagen no longer allow hasbro produce toy molds likeness their cars , because they don't want their vehicles thought " war toys " . when lot transformers fans heard new bumblebee figure going released something other than vw bug , they shuddered . i one them . however , this figure really won me over . car mode so-so , i'll admit . it not only not bug , it not any " real-life " car . i also didn't like all white it because i'm used bumblebee all yellow vehicle form . i'm also not big fan trailer/wave crusher . i don't think it adds anything because while it transforms into jetpack , it takes 3 years change it over jetpac trailer , doesn't seem stay hitch well . other hand , robot form out this world . this bumblebee how long-time fans always hoped he'd toy . he very posable lot fun . he bends all over place , you twist flex his legs arms into all sorts positions . either way , i think he good buy , whether it sentimental purposes or your kids play .	1
my granddaughter 3 she actually pollys magnetic clothes . this great value	1
i would not recommend this globe . i bought this my 3rd grader first day using it , equator peeled off !! i thought keeping it anyway but decided deal hassle plan returning it . it also feels too flimsy fall over easily	-1
i paid twice much , i wouldn't happier this product . it much easier use more complete than flat map . it great value money	1
i so excited see this sale , especially after seeing picture baby inside toy under customer photos . when it arrived , i very disappointed . picture clearly larger version this , it doesn't tell you . this actually quite small . when i ordered , there no dimensions listed description , i'm not sure if they changed it . it only 15 inches tall wide . also , toy isn't really great . bead thing neat , but sliding puzzles sides pretty pointless you only slide them inch . music drum thing attached very short cord , so it hard use it xylophone . it relatively durable though , made nice wood , so it probably last . but then again , my son barely plays it , so he wont chance break it anyway .	1
this monitor so much static ! we would always move it all over our bedroom just find good spot . sometimes you hear other babies crying ! when it comes through our monitor we can't tell if it our baby or not ! then top it off , cord broke so we ended up tape it monitor keep it plugged . otherwise it would unplug itself we would wake up morning find it off ! only good thing this product lights but you find other ones . don't waste your money .... keep looking	-1

i purchased this car my 4 year old son . when car shaken it makes real engine reving sounds , it allows enough time little children put car down floor before it takes off . it go very far . it works much better hard surface than carpet . we created some ramps out cardboard car jump , it actually gets up enough speed jump ramps . this fun car . i would say only draw back little kids won't shake car long enough it go very far . when my husband i shake it we get car go great distance further than our kids .	1
i got this car my 2 years old nephew , he loves it , colors bright , noise its makes movemensthank yo	1

our 6 yr old enjoying this product . she needs help getting quicker drilling addition subtraction this helping . she likes when green light lights up tell her she correct . levels very good since my niece ( 8 yrs ) , nephew ( 10 yrs ) adults all tried it . if it durable enough , it should last her years she gets multiplication etc . she doesn't think it fun though - it just something when she bored . this reason we keep it van . our plan working though because she climbs into her seat immediately turns it . we it our home awhile but there too many other fun things besides math ! if your child enjoys challenging math facts , they think it fun though - our 8 yr old niece so myself my husband	1

my son loves backyardigans we've now begin collect all five stuffed animals ty ( he began tasha since he loves hippos ! ) . tasha girlish yellow hippo flair dramatic . she often plays lady tasha manor or volcano princess ! well-stitched adorable , ty version tasha her wearing non-removable dark orange dress flower motif -- well fabric shoes ( also non-removable . ) distance , ty backyardigans may look like they're made rough , itchy fabric -- but they not . fabric soft smooth -- somewhat like chenille . if your child loves backyardigans , enjoys fantasy play ( like tea parties or role playing ) , or perhaps needs friend keep him/her company bedtime -- tasha would make wonderful present	1
this my little grandaughter - who never watched backyardigans . i gave her tasha she just loved her . she now watching show faithfully . my grandaughter loves dance so we always see her dancing tasha during shows	1
i'm my second soothe surprise nature light because first one squeaked so loudly . amazon replaced it quickly but moving parts second one also started squeaking . first it quiet i decided i'd just live it , but noise gradually got louder louder . it too late return amazon so i contacted v-tech e-mail followed their troubleshooting instructions . when didn't work , i called them . only way they replace it if i send back mine first . since i can't get my baby sleep night without it ( despite noise ) i really need replacement first . they not willing bend this policy even when i offered give my credit card number so they could bill me if they didn't receive replacement back . i guess i'll just keep it hope my baby continues enjoy listening squeaking ! despite all , i like toy . my baby didn't take it instantly though . it start act flaky when batteries start getting weak , so check first if you're problems it . but i can't recommend it others two now squeak so loudly .	-1

this cutest little baby carriage . our two year old daughter got it christmas . our daughter uses it corolle lila baby doll , which i also highly recommend . carriage fits up 17 " doll ( snugly ) very sturdy . i like fact bed part lifts out baby basket , it nice stroller fold up like real one . my complaint - bed part not fastened well enough . there two velcro pieces sides , one back , two snaps . that it . i would liked there little more holding it , because when kids push baby down carriage , it tends sag . i probably add some more velcro my own front carriage see if it helps . my two year old daughter not stay stroller herself , but if we take her carriage her baby lila , she pushes her baby stays right me . we get lot comments how cute she how cute baby carriage . i recommend this toy would purchase it again	1

i've playing scrabble almost 2 years now , i profess completely know only 2 3 letter words . scrabble really expands your vocabulary , but don't expect it use them daily life , or more commonly , not know meaning all . you see , achieve scrabble ' cramming ' , top players rarely , if ever memorise word meanings . they memorise them utility . so while you may triumph many word game , it not significantly improve your english . fact , 2003 world champion panupol sujjayakorn admitted his english still poor spite what must massive vocabulary numbering over million . i highly recommend one scrabble dictionaries , cut out those niggly disputes when person invents insists word exists . i myself use collins 2005 edition . among word games , this king . just don't waste all your time memorising words - there better things out there . really :)	1

just description says , marvel universe yours ! using square colorforms every imaginable marvel character spiderman venom spidergirl . bad guys , good guys , superheros you've never heard ( scarlet witch ?? ) ! there only 20 characters you need select put board , but over 100 characters choose . you name it , they're there : hulk , dr. octopus , red skull , silver surfer , iron man , fantastics , x-men ! it take little while setup , but it fun everyone sit around deciding who gets go board . once they're board , you decide keep same lineup several games , or go back make minor adjustments . maybe dr. doom shouldn't expensive spots ... maybe replace him professor . you also obviously need take heading character put it property cards . example if spiderman put boardwalk space it referred space# 40 ( 40th square board ) . there colorform word " spiderman " you need put onto blue property card space# 40 . chance cards called " thwppt ! " " snickt ! " . only bad part these they obviously refer " space #40 " or " go space #12 " rather than saying " spiderman " or " go hulk " . tokens cool : spider-man , ghost rider , phoenix force , silver surfer , kingpin , wolverine . railroads replaced flying machines . utilities replaced dr. doom mansion x-men place . money same ( except pictures spiderman hulk them ) you still collect $200 when you pass go , or go jail , free parking . i kind wish they would spiced those spaces up bit more . least picture dr. octopus jail ( spaces all traditional pictures regular monopoly ) . it brings whole new dimension though monopoly . really fun . you feel like you're playing different game each time	1
my husband i bought this some friends ended up opening it staying up hours just reading cards eachother . some sick twisted some gross but some start really indepth conversations . then some just make you laugh till you cry . they divided into catergories such eating , pain , embarassment , ethics . we haven't actually played game rules but just cards worth it .	1

this one my favorite batman lego sets out six there so far . this includes batman catwoman minifig reminiscent michelle pfeiffer . batdragster cool catwoman motorcycle . one downside it doesn't include batarangs or machine guns like others , but what it lacks batarangs it makes up catwoman . i found mine goodwill , but most other kids settle buying it store	1
it got bells -- whistles ! plays train sounds clack clack bell sound train crossing . you wind up track train manually , put train it away you go . i love fact this toy not battery-eater like most his others , it double duty block-building table , too ! alex 17 months still plays this ; we got it him 9 1/2 months . he loves take top off sit it , or sit floor his knees front it use inside area little table eat snack off . he his own table chairs , but sometimes he prefers use this . there no songs play , none advertised , despite previous reviewers comments . there two versions this table available -- this one , so-called new , improved , electronic , musical version , which i think pales comparison this original . who needs one more musical toy everything but allow kid use their imagination play ? not me ! if you want good old-fashioned toy , your kid love long time stand up type use , get this . you'll glad you . i only wish i could find more plastic blocks come this themselves , rather than playsets sold separately	1

good king looking someone take over throne he no children . he decided ask people locate magic treasure prove their worth . board made up twisting branching paths lead village , through forest , into castle . cards used determine what king looking . card scene popular fairy tale picture desired object . players move their pieces through forest looking trees . each tree pieces treasure hidden under it . players landing tree get secretly look treasure . once they know where desired treasure , they head castle tell king . first player successfully find three desired treasures wins game . magic also used game . certain rolls dice , players teleport any tree their choosing , go castle gate , or randomly change desired treasure card . movement little different than most games . two dice used but they not added . instance , roll 5 4 get you nine spaces but it also get you five spaces one direction four . this way 4 5 used move one space . thus subtraction skills become important addition skills . while my two kids love game ( ages four seven ) it elements make it palatable adult well . check it out	1
my daughter loved this game since she six years old . craftsmanship game itself beautiful . game-pieces little trees wooden , illustrations old-fashioned fairytale variety , very intricate colourful . cards good , thick cardboard stand up years use . it looks like very old game one would find attic trunk . winning depends such variety strategy , memory , just plain luck combination ages play concurrently feel equally challenged . i recommend enchanged forest highly . it feast colours , delight behold touch , it provides good mental exercise . what more could you ask	1

shape swing , curved like sling , makes my 2-year old son slide down . he can't sit up straight slides into slouch . colder weather , when he wearing more than light jacket , bulk jacket makes it impossible even get him stay swing . since there no way him sit up straight slide his rear end back ( even without jacket ) , he ends up right edge swing when wearing jacket , his body basically straight position which causes him slide right off . plus , harness straps not very long when adjusted their maximum , so heavier jacket they don't fit . i'm not talking big child here either . 29 months , my son still only weighs 25 pounds . i'm taking this off our swingset getting little tikes toddler swing	1
i bought this swing put new variety climber swing set extension we just bought . my 7 month old 22 month old fit perfectly it . when my best friends 20 month old boy came over try out new play set he just bairly fit . he not overweight toddler , just tall muscular . there no way bigger kid would fit . so i am going tomorrow buy little tykes high back toddler chair our bigger guests . one really nice feature this chair it 5 point harness belt . really comforting . i really feel my babies safe sitting it .	1
there nothing like waking up 2am few nights row voice saying " o olive " . keep mind it takes you few moments before you correctly determine it puzzle talking , not intruder or " voices " you now hearing . ( i completely panicked first two times ) . it keep repeating phrase 20+ times ( i counted ) , so you get out bed , middle night look screwdriver , so you take out batteries , because there no off switch	-1
these playmats fantastic . they cushion yet sturdy durable . my son chews these mats like candy yet they kept their shape . they great little new crawlers need alittle padding resistance their little knees . [ ... ] just warning new parents thinking playmats . we three sets ( large family ) these our favorite far . all other sets we shapes numbers them come out . it huge pain when our son plays w/ these mats because you end up your knee trying find missing pieces all time . save your back , money , time just buy whole pieces without all fancy decor ( letters , numbers , animals , elct . ) comes out , they just end up missing or other side room out mat you pick up figure out where it goes mat . also pieces get old when you move mat around all pieces fall out everywhere , everytime you move it you put whole puzzle back together .	1
we knew we needed something our little one play , this what we needed , thus bought . it bit thicker than multi-colored ones . she fallen her head without hurting herself . it , however , get expensive , we buy 3 sets cover her small play area . but we can't put price her noggin	1
we purchased this wagon after reading other positive reviews . our little two year old girl loves it . it probably bit big her , but it didn't take her long crawl . it took her little longer ( couple falls ) learn get back out . she loves riding it gathering things our " nature walks " bring back home . she also pull it herself . solid construction very easy put together .	1
my daughter just loves this wagon ! we rented it local amusement park she not want get out . we knew we one . we loved fact it actual axle easy turning . our previous wagon wheels directly connected wagon super hard turn . they would get stuck sideways you could not get thing move . this only plastic wagon we could find front axle which made this top choice us ! this great choice children too old stroller but too small walk . we loved storage underneath cup holders . we also like it holds two children plenty room all their stuff !! lastly , we loved surface flat so children nap if they tired !! (our last wagon seats each end so this not option)*we planning buying attachable umbrellas offered radio flyer this summer protect our little ones sun ( great plus !	1
this wagon fantastic . you fit 2 - 3 kids it , plus put food it . there cool hidden compartment you flip up . it fits 6 cans soda . this wagon also comes cup holders . we've used it zoo which perfect especially if you like bring food . we've used this go park , too . it largest wagon available	1

my three year old loves her new fisher price " ipod " . she loves pink color choose her favorite songs icon pictures(a great feature ) . my only complaint volume its highest level still very low which makes it difficult her hear while riding car interstate while traveling	1
screws pain screw little screwdriver they provide , but when i tried power drill , it stripped screws no time . so i went back manual screwdriver two blisters later , i think it really quality easel , storage space excellent idea . most easels just don't seem worth space they take up . wheels great idea take it outside when weather nice ... makes easy transport . overall , i am very satisfied this item , but i agree other reviewer cheap screws	1
balls added ball pit . i expected balls bigger not remember dimensions listed	1

if you thinking purchasing this car , note seat small length pedals short . thefore , it suited small children . description says children 3+ , but when our 4.5 year old ( who very small 4.5 ) tried it out , it way too small . it extremely difficult our child pedal comfortably . it alot interesting buttons sound effects , but i would say based size seat length pedals this more ideally suited children 3 or 4 only .	1

first all , yes markers stain , so keep mind when your children sit down play this . good news stains come out . those you problems try adding whatever clothing stained bucket hot water ... pour 1/4th -1/2 cup hydrogen peroxide into bucket let sit 30-45 minutes . stains come out .. this product excellent pre-schoolers who interest drawing . i love trace mechanism this quite frankly it one best " trace " teaching tools i've seen . children love " flourescent " look it hard get this away them ! you also add pictures them draw making your own ..... just use white crayon or marker highlight picture voila you more pictures ..	1

works well enough once your kid pedal themselves , although both my kids tipped it plenty times . steering bar isn't effective . it too much give prob fact it designed collapse . plus it doesn't actually steer bike ( some fancier models this option ) . pin lock handle bars doesn't always stick . there no brakes this thing . good pushing your kid around when they haven't figured out concept pedals . dangerous if your kid old enough ride themself goes careening down hill because they can't stop don't want use fred flinstone braking method . not worth money , imo	-1
my son 2 half this his first bike . he looks adorable bike but unless i want go over help him he can't seem manage his own . why ? well darn trike impossible steer one secondly it tips over very easily . it really unsturdy . also what up no breaks ? this cute bike take some pics looking cute but serious bike riding .. forget it ! -mom orlando ,	-1

my daughter loves this little radio flyer tricyle !!! she rides it around house constantly it seems sturdy well made . great buy	1
looks nice , but remember this inexpensive toy . so stamped steel pieces hardware show their " made china " origins . front wheel not true ( straight ) , thereby making aligning handlebars front fender wheel impossible . very aggravating . so handlebars now straight reference frame , but front wheel tilts over tiny bit , front fender sits crooked . that best compromise . paint seems nice , though	-1
thank you your prompt mailing little mommy shopping cart . it received good condition	1

my two-year-old daughter loves her computer ! we started 1-3 software- one came it , let imagine home hunt . those more interactive it seems than 3-5 software , but she really enjoys world colors anyway . she thinks it funny make purple banana . only negatives older software use word " dummy " " move " review mentioned . also , world colors just one level . younger software provides more variety levels . software comes overlay frustrating you your toddler first . my daughter wouldn't leave it keyboard first but after couple times learned accept it use it appropriately . now she knows which overlay she needs which game . all software easy change into language which great reinforcer her spanish class well . rude comments software actually opened up discussion her what would better say or what nice what not . my daughter spends least hour it each time she sits down it which once week ( i don't allow her use it more than twice week ) . main thing it reinforces colors shapes creates fun environment holds her attention . plus , she loves control happenings . i don't feel guilty setting her front it while i try get something else because it provide some learning . it better than just watching tv show , but course never compare human interaction .	1
my son 22 month old he absolutely loves it . he literally not want go bed wants play morning soon he wakes up . we set his computer his desk our office , now mom , dad , son play/work computers together . he finds it amazing this " big tv " actually responds him when he hits keyboard . right away he started repeating words , became more interested expanding his vocabulary watching our every move too . i bought let imagine birthday party . some cds choice portuguese , which my first language . he speaking both english portuguese , softwares helping his language development . he not stay front computer too long , he very active needs always moving . but he lot fun 10-15 minutes time he plays it . i strongly recommend younger toddlers .	1
i got this product my 2 year old granddaughter christmas . she lot fun it while i let her play it . however , soon i heard thewords " move " instead excuse me please , sun calling moon " dummy " . it . we taught our granddaughter polite . she says please , thank you , excuse me . i think this toy teaching wrong things small children . they learn rudeness soon enough school , they don't need learn it home	-1

money , gears great . gears wear out kids manually turn gears opposite way .	1
my son enjoyed this toy since i got it him 15 months old . he couldn't turn it off himself til maybe couple months later , but he liked playing w/ gears . now when he plays w/ it once while , he usually leaves it running , but we haven't change batteries very often . not sure why it rated 3+ , probably small size stickers , but smallest gear 1 1/2 " diameter would pretty tough choke . it well made . stickers haven't peeled off after lot handling magnets firmly place . gears turn very smoothly . it works great fridge or magnetic dry erase boards	1
we believed this greatest purchase our twins it offered two seats , extra cup holders , storage . then one my sons ( 18 mos . ) stuck his finger hole designed canopy . we could broken his finger after attempting grab him ( screaming ) out wagon without knowing it lodged . i called radio flyer since it very scary difficult remove my son finger . i liked this wagon very much decided try it one more time , but my kids still too curious holes . plus their fingers not getting any smaller . now wagon going back radio flyer . company offered pick it up full refund . radio flyer so far treating this isolated case . company not currently recall wagons canopy holes . my issue still suppose escalated throughout radio flyer executive management . so there might future design changes , but not now . i cannot imagine this issue isolated problem . canopy nice use really sunny days , but not all time . nothing else could used plug ( 4 ) holes since may pose choking hazard . we're very bummed giving up wagon , but it makes sense safety reasons .	-1
this great wagon- easy handle , my girls love it ! i 18 month , 4 year old , they both fit very comfortably- lots room spare maltese dog we have- though top could made sturdier , little more coverage- but all all it worth money sure	1
i bought frog habitat before doing any real research into frog keeping , now i feel i wasted money i would deprived my daughter actual learning experience i continued use it . i ordered " free " tadpole ( $7 shipping/handling fee ) . it came four weeks later mail . i put it habitat following directions it lasted maybe 4 hours . they promptly sent replacement which lived slightly longer . heartbreaking my daughter . i've since learned kind tadpole they send notoriously difficult care age . i later bought same kind tadpole , but much older , local store it conventional aquarium filter aeration . boy , sucker hardy compared what they sent ! i put frog enclosure away . i may use it crickets or something . kind tadpole they send leopard frog . leopard frogs jumpers . based my research , habitat really too small this kind frog . i since built terrarium my daughter i plan house current tad when it reaches frog stage . it nice green plants dirt rocks . short , it much more appropriate home frog . we lot fun building it we got talk environment how things depend each other . much more educational it prettier look . also , this thing leaks if you get any water plastic layers , which very easy when you fill it	-1

after reading reviews here i figured it worth taking chance price . most time all mine slop lot solution everywhere . sometimes it would make one bubble would float couple feet die . i would advise caution one respect if you decide buy one these . bubbles consist lot solution one popped my 4 year old nephew he got it his eyes which stung enough make him cry . lack it creating bubbles even more disappointing him . personally i don't think there any good bubble makers out there . latest toy i bought my nephew starts out fun but ends up making huge mess after 10 minutes using it	-1
my son received this his 3rd birthday after seeing commercial nickelodeon asking it every time he saw commercial . it really neat , actually makes huge bubbles like commercial , its easy . my 3 year old no problem holding wand opening it letting wind blow bubbles out . warned though , this kind messy . wand so long huge when you dip it into container bubble solution it drips quite bit . so adult supervision needed smaller kids . i usually hold container let him dip wand into it . but he loves toy , he loves chasing bubbles . haven't run out solution yet , its only few weeks , but probably just make our own when it runs out . overall i think this good toy get kids up out house , which kids need more today . its inexpensive , fun whole family	1
this absolutely worst babyproofing product we ever wasted money time ... like other reviewers , we cleaned contact points suction cups until they gleaming it just wouldn't stick . we tried it 3 different toilets , all which slightly different design , it instantly popped off all three . my 6 year old now uses it rescue tool his rescue heroes ..	-1
i bought this my son christmas just something different . we played this most ! i knew nothing them so snapping them together all different ways creative fun . then we realized they make noise when snapped together certain way they slide open extend then push back small . they make joints similar ball join t.t he learning/creativity just goes . my son made patterns , art bugs . i highly recommned this toy	1
my kids ** love ** this game ! i ordered " yo ! sacramento " same author , we found it extraordinarily easy learn states capitals . but , he still hard time remembering where states . this helped great deal , it loads fun	1
my kids love this game , learned so much united states . there 50 state cards , even more game cards . everyone receives 5 state cards , then game card read which say something lines , " touches pacific ocean ; capital 4 syllables ; nickname plant or animal it ; etc ... " first player call out appropriate state his hand wins round . it amazing how information sticks young minds - i admit i look enclosed map every time card ' touches tennessee " comes up , but even my 4 year old scan his hand almost instantaneously call out correct state - if he one . kids love this game so much they want design their own game cards add game ! someone else noted , reading skills helpful , but my 4 year old didn't let deter him ( although when he started playing this game he strong pre-reading skills ) . i also recommend book scrambled states america - this game plus book would make nice present child up through 2nd-3rd grade .	1
i used this game many groups 5th graders fun activity conjunction their study states . kids actively engaged , using enclosed map locate specific state , reading cards learn state capital , nickname ... after few playing sessions , students become more proficient knowing state location it capital . each time game played , there different outcome , unlike typical board game where everyone follows same path . playing cards duplicate same quirky , whimsical illustrations laurie keller " scrambled states america " book . game fast-paced ( avg playing time 10-15 mins)and students love it so much they often want stay during recess play some more !	1
this tamagotchi so cool . it tends more needy than others very sensitive different tyeps food . it loves play games . if you get this tamagotchi it soon get job so i highly recommend banker . i not taken my eyes off this tamagotchi since i got it . somtimes i acsadently neglect my tamagotchi . you buy this item amazon or " toys us	1
my second grader loves this puzzle ! he put it together several times since christmas . wood base shows capitals , but not states or their shapes , so he really learning where each state goes starting even learn capitals . would recommend ages 7-10	1
thought this would provide fun my 12-year-old her crew valentine day , but product arrived three days after holiday ( 10 days ship even though it stock ) when you shake it turn it over see answer , you barely see words . sounds like something inside broken , but i'm not going bother returning it this point . it thought counted . cute idea , but execution me lackluster	-1
okay , tried this out five seven year old . both them tired it within fifteen minutes . i mean , how many " snowflakes " person make	-1
i've sea monkeys before never lasted long . i got this one , after 6 months they all died . but i completely forgot tank , so i never flushed it out . two weeks went , suddenly there tons babies ! it happened few times now , they all die , but after while , new ones born . i've it year half . so if yours die , try waiting couple weeks	1
i love my sea monkeys so much ! they so cute ! but they very , very tiny . not sad if you not see them right away . they still there even though you can't see them . i began see them second day you too ! million bubble air pump very important because they die without air . this set comes everything you need ! i'm going feed them first time tomorrow i can't wait ! i hope you fun too !	1
i bought this after hearing how much my son ( then 6 monthos old ) loved stacking cups his ' school ' . he now turn 3 still enjoys them , his baby sister . it wonderful see how both them played these different times . you see little engineering minds nurtured they nest , stack - knock over towers ! i would love it just - but this also includes sorting shapes help them work problem solving too ! some cups wee shapes holes , which adds fun bath time . buckets would fun bath time anyway ( useful rinsing hair little bodies ) but it great them explore way water goes through holes some them . then we've got help learning count ... each inner cups/buckets number it , ( large bucket lid un-numbered #11 , but still stackable ) appropriate number * things * each ( stars , kitty face , etc . ) this set very durable - we've it over two years only handle bucket broke ( i stepped it ) but not big deal . one annoying thing handle bucket kept coming off . i stepped one cups also , it some white marks where plastic bent , but it still basically fine continues stack well . pieces well made enough , if you cups right order , they stack make very stable tall tower ... which just so much fun knock over . my son still loves these cups , my daughter really enjoys them too - she just learning joys knocking down towers . course my son other toys he plays , especially now he growing older , but i've heard people say they don't want ' waste ' money toys babies - this money would not wasted . it great developmentally - helping build variety skills understanding world - it one those great simple toys infinite number ways played .	1
what great chair ! i got it my daughter it just it says , pink snuggley chair ! sturdy very easy set up take down . loved furry cover ! would recomend minute free shipping too good pass up	1
i love this game i love it so cheap . only complaint i i didn't choice shipping , it took longer than i wanted ... i would paid extra but didn't even option	1
this game really fun , easy carry around especially good large groups . we played it christmas day it great	1
i one these sorters over year no problems . i use it without wrappers so there no jams . when i get home each night i just throw change my pockets there once week hit sort button . when i see full chamber i wrap coins put safe place until next time i go bank . its so easy use . i one each bedroom my house so everyone use it	1
primary purpose coin sorter put correct number coins into appropriate wrapper so you take it bank . that what i bought mine , anyway . this thing so imprecise you never really know how many coins wrapper . result , if you really want sure you count them . that huge drag sort defeats purpose owning this machine far i'm concerned . also , " overflow " reservoir where 25% coins end up whether tubes full or not . i previously owned coin sorter similar this one far its simplicity etc . but much more reliable . don't waste your pennies ultra sorter	-1
my daughter loves this toy plays it all time ~ we it over year now ! a++	1
overall game pretty good my 3 year old . graphics pretty good game fun . time , when he masters game , there no additional levels expand game .	1
my daughter loves this game , few others she , like care bears , winnie pooh , alphabet game , lion king older cartridge : little mermaid . she got it her birthday figured out how play them very quickly ! i'm impressed ! i think learning tool this great help her . she speach impairment it made learning fun her . i find it better than ps2 games my husband plays she taken liking . it more her age not just mindless games . it makes them think they learn all same time . it gives us something both sit down . learning tool i find it well worth money , well time put into it play it	1
this toy not good children just learning walk . back handle falls off constantly if pulled even slightly . mickey mouse ride-on/push toy much better choice ... my 12 month old son pushes it all over house loves all buttons	-1
i found this purchase reality what i expected it advertising photo . it reasonable size ( eggs 1 1/2 " long ) , likely stand up many years play	1
i bought these sale (...) it more than worth it . i would even say they worth more than . my sisters their kids my house ( 7 kids ) we all took turns making different recordings ( even adults ) we cracking up . i wish i would gotten extras christmas gifts	1
this product loads fun . my daughter loved hearing her own voice making sounds book . we never problem microphone , just pen when she decided chew through cord . no worries leap pad replaces them 5 dollars	1
we've purchased this doll my 3.5 years old daughter . she loves it goes sleep it . she presses ribbon when she under her blanket see glow ... truth me it just doll ( one too many ) , but she adores princesses , so her it real treat	1
this furniture made very nicely , very durable . it nice addition any little girl ' just moving ' , but i wouldn't buy it this site , because it extremely over priced , $49 bucks , you nuts ? you get this set any store $7.99 . it not like it collector item hard find , get real ! i would recommend getting this somewhere else , you get way more your dollar . other than price , set cute well made , but don't buy this seller , he over priced	1
this well made product . great design . good materials . no sharp edges . well worth money . my daughter loves it . it strong enough i sit it time time ( 150 lbs ) . easy assemble . we got it our daughter when she 1 1/2 years old put pillow under it so she could climb up it . she really loves it . lots smiles giggles	1
my 6 year-old son i tackled this project over series days . finished product truly work art , my opinion , looks better than any pictures . pros : outstanding detail , including working turbines engine you see above . feels solid when complete it rolls . ( most lego kits my son fall apart some point . not this one . ) cool flip up front turn steering wheel . cons ( these minor ): unfortunately , steering not turn actual wheels . no cool lego batman sit seat . instructions tough follow since almost 90% this kit black ! ( we few times where we redo past section because we installed it improperly . ) flames back very fragile fall off easily . quibble ... its original design doesn't look like any batmobiles you seen movies or tv . if you patience ( its 1,045 pieces , two instruction books 85 steps ) batman fan , this kit lot fun looks great when complete . well , lego !	1
my toddler enjoys this fisher price read me dvd very much ! she asks chicka chicka boom boom frequently . she learned match her capital small letters age two using this system . it easy operate -- she runs system herself . she watches story one time through , then goes right learning games every time	1
great educational toy . i 2 kids special needs this great way them learn read . i am hard time finding more dvd books system . found some here . hope they continue make them	1
i don't completely understand appeal this toy , but my son loved it moment his grandmother bought it him whim nearly two years ago . now , his younger sister cousin play it almost daily . one problem someone snapped off one doors shape-sorter part toy . also , " bed , " " chair , " other unidentifiable item go house part pretty goofy looking . kids would just happy without them . still , money well-spent	1
we visiting my inlaws europe they bought this toy our 20 month old daughter . out all toys we brought over she played this everday . we actually ship it back us . now she 3 my youngest 1 this still most popular toy house . it typical shape sorter hammer combo , but stairs where bear pops out cars big hit . i would recommend this toy anyone . very durable , washes it up great , still fun even after it over year . we bought many other chicco toys this still winner . i never written review amazon , but believe this deserves five star rating	1
we've this ball over 6 months our little one won't give it time day . i never seen her so disinterested toy before . i brought this because we several other manhattan baby products we just adore . this one huge disappointment . it much smaller than picture posted there no textures or anything really engage baby . it also odd because our ellie loves " taggies " but she not teeniest bit enticed many tags this . i would not recommend this product	-1
i agree everything madam pince review , but would just add they quite expensive add up really fast . my sons some plastic thomas trains they breaking batteries always fall out . wooden ones last forever , although paint chips off edges pretty fast . they so easy connect . my two year old knows how make sure they going right direction so magnets attract . i started small wooden train set toys us ended up becoming addicted thomas characters . now my sons probably 3 dozen wooden ones . if you want cheaper alternative , metal take thomas trains very nice quality also connect magnets . i think they actually look nicer , they more detail . they little smaller might just little more breakable ( some plastic parts ) . only possible downfall metal ones track . they only fit little plastic take track , which i don't like well wooden track , but more portable . anyway , if you don't mind paying twice much ( or more ) wooden ones last longest wooden track gives you many more options expanding creating new destinations . we spent hundreds these trains track , but my sons love them so much , i suppose it worth it . everyone always knows what get them birthdays christmas	1
james great job pulling coaches track . he pull pretty much anything fast pace . i've my jame sfor 9 years it looks almost new . he great engine you live episodes these trains	1
i bought these my 13 month old grandaughter . they make crinkly noise she loved them . she kept trying put baskets her head . it kept her entertained	1
this car extremely fast . steering car very responsive . kid love it , actually ordered one so kid race each other . battery only runs 20 minutes , order extra battery packs . this hobby grade car , not base version .	1
my seven year old got this track christmas . most challenging part putting it together getting loop ends hold together long enough snap loop connectors . i found tracks fit together well . remember use track joiners . if car jumps track , check see edges joined track smooth . tracks flexible so you bend them bit . make sure you wind cars until you hear loud clicking noise . this high quality toy , which it easier find	1
just gave this track our 3.5 year old son hanukkah . he very excited it minute we pulled it out box . tracks parts look very impressive . it took me , relatively intelligent 37 year old , 20 minutes put it together . once we it set up , it difficult get him away bath time . i definitely would recommend this toy kid who loves cars	1
this great learning tool kids learn skate . if you bad back it kills you trying hold kid up while they learn skate , but otherwise great learning tool . very sturdy love levels they give beginners already knowing how skate . little hard get feet out but i give it 4 stars	1
skates real hit my daughter . only negative i relate weight restriction skates should stated shoe size requirements . my daughter weighs more than 44 pounds listed , but i could not take them away her soon she opend box use them first time	1
like reviewer , sand bound up moving parts it largely frustrating my twin 2 year olds . boom release too hard my children release . bucket not pivot wrist-so it really not scopp up sand -- it just kind paws it . i suggest spending few more dollars getting better functioning toy your child	-1
i bought this my son 2nd birthday , since he construction truck fanatic . after reading other reviews , i prepared minor tweaking this toy required ( ie , taking apart locking mechanism , which very easy if you follow other reviewer advice ) . this definite must , my son frustrated immediately toy manufacturer made it . but after locking mechanism removed this toy incredible he plays it sandbox all time . it far his favorite toy held up wear tear sand pretty well . great buy one very cool toy	1
i bought tamagotchi amazon , it won't link up other tamagotchi , i bought 2 1 works 1 don't , can't see spending more money this piece trash get it fixed	-1

i only wish there more blocks . my son who 3 enjoyed them continues enjoy them build build build . love these blocks	1
we purchased this toy our son last christmas . first all eight year old not able put this together . it might even difficult adult . when we finally finished it we put it it major problems . gears kept skipping . we called company see if there something we could they told us " well , really this toy not ment last " lot help they . so over all it giant waste money . it made it final resting place dump	-1
purchased radio flyer little red wagon my two year son christmas . we all love it ! it perfect all our needs . our son pulls his stuffed animals , toys , dirt , rocks around ease . i appreciate steering turning radius wagon , it enable our son maneuver wagon this own . we all know this very important two year olds ! mom dad love it haul child longer walks , we pick up pace get dome exercise . it also makes running errands around neighborhood great ! wagon large enough our son two bags groceries . we live rainy northwest occasion left wagon out side , no rust or water damage . there reason this wagon classic ! note : i would also purchase pad well .	1
this toy favorite . i love tune , it stuck our heads we all bob our heads quacks . my daughter also walks around house saying " wack wack wack " also it whenever she sees bird any kind . it really cracked us up ! red connectors get bent easily , so watch how you leave it box , but it fix itself easily too . ducks fall over lot beginning . she would actually get mad me when i righted them her . result our ducks no paint one side . but now she it herself manages pull them just fine . it very loud when we first got it but i think batteries dying i'm very sad i can't figure out how replace them . i used dread putting toys away because something would hit it it'd start quacking , amplified toy bucket , wake everyone up . sometimes string gets wrapped around wheel doesn't get pulled enough quack , but my daughter supply sound effects just fine . she loves push carts drag stuff behind her so i'm sure this last ... but i miss quacking !	1
i bought this 1-year olds birthday 7 years ago . my husband spent month before party , pulling string . he sad when i took it birthday girl . i looked high low one him . after 8 months , i again found it . he loves it . it such stress buster you simply gotta smile when you hear quack , quack , quack . when my aunt cousin ( both adults ) came visit , they too fell love it . unfortunately store i found it out again . this 3 years ago . i found it again today bought both store left . i plan get some additional ones hand . i truly believe every adult needs " feed " kid him/her . so , if you think this toy only children 10 months - 5 years , think again	1
this great little ones who like my little pony . pony walks says number different phrases . she good not getting stuck against walls , etc but she doesn't run very well carpet . my only complaint there no volume control since she runs best our hardwood floors sound quite loud .	1
i think this toy awesome !!! she sometimes gets bit confused where you want her go but overall she fun play . she really move her legs so amazed me but basically it because metal attraction . her talking cute but some times wierd . this pony my second most favorite toy	1

we got this our 1 1/2 yr old 3 yr old boys x-mas . i don't know who loves this car more , kids or my husband . my favorite feature abou this toy how remote control fits into car becomes part car when not use . my toddler loves carrying handle . we not experienced any operational problems mentioned several reviews . downside , this car little fast recommended age group . our house open floor plan so we not experiencing many crashes . i would not recommend this car if you tight living quarters . also , i would recommend keeping your pets out way when car use .	1

this toy such hit my son i still purchase it gift other toddlers . it amazing how much fun they it how long it holds their interest . this must	1
concept behind this toy great , but engineering/design not . looking picture here , i believe they may redesigned since we got our son one 6 months ago chute attaches differently pictured . perhaps this works better because chute constantly coming apart ours . we've also problem balls getting stuck or just kind swaying back forth . music horribly loud . we turn it off if we're trying watch tv son playing room . many musical toys least low high volume switch . this one desperately needs one !! positive , our son love watch balls grab them they pop out or go down chute . he chase balls when they go flying . he not quite old enough know how put them back toy once they out , but he'll get there . he'd probably play it lot more i more tolerance music	-1

my daughter loves this thing .. she would sit watch ants hours if we let her ... we bought it teach her little bit responsibility so far its working . i'm glad we didn't just get regular ant farm , this one more entertaining	1
first , only one ant arrived alive . we sent off more total five living ants . these five great week then slowly starved death because they wouldn't come out sand tunnels . my seven year old so disappointed heart broken when he realized they all died . it really hard even see their tunnels because instructions say not move farm fear collapsing tunnels . now , we're waiting spring gather our own ants . guess what ? " sand " starting mold !!! total waste money , thanks uncle milton	-1
i ordered this my son 6th birthday . i knew experience we order ants wait spell good weather them arrive . here what worked me : i opened box when i got it sent ants right away . ( fyi : order tube ants , nothing else , it $3.95 . includes shipping . get ant farm club kit , which includes ants , food , magnifying glass , bunch other fun stuff , it costs $10.95 . includes shipping well . i decided splurge club kit ! ) ants arrived week after his birthday . he extremely excited get them ! while ants waited fridge ten minutes , i put sand/water combination ant farm . i put few drops sugar water then shook ants tube . while watching ants grow accustomed their new-found space , i decided i'd count . i think there 29 ants tube ( plus few spare body parts --- yuck ) . i counted 19 them living . few them died first day , but now i think we 13 live ants . that plenty small little space . i think i've more fun watching them than kids . it awesome see them grab sand move it elsewhere make tunnel . they're really fun ! i plan order more ants after these ones die . ( order form conveniently shipped ants . ) buy confidence ! this great gift	1

my son really enjoys his mater r/c towtruck . it even pulls his lightning car around house . my only complaint mater too fast , little slower or lower geared mater might better indoor use	1
my 5 year old son throughly enjoyed this recent addition his remote control collection - it extremely fast easy control . actually b/c it so fast takes moment stop we've ban certain areas house . i wish i gotten one my daughter she too loves mater when we're racing w/the other rc cars , we can't catch mater ! tow line ok , needs little sturdier i wish you could control it rc , it manual hook , little flimsy , but otherwise , i would purchase this any cars fan or children who like rc vechiles .	1
my son loves this dvd story . i think any read me products winner parent or child loves story time or reading time . i hardly believe they slashed prices or it didn't really sell much . i think society today should buy this type educational item more than video games kids ... my son cameron really loves this , parent , this great concept . all means you should own this item .	1

while this tv game cartoon-like graphics , it lot better than dvd game . it lot faster cases all lined up where you see which ones you haven't opened . you also start career mode where you keep track how much money you won total . it also bonus round end game where you win more money , even much $ 1,000,000 . game also features voice howie mandel all sounds music show . this definitely worth money , unlike incredibly slow dvd game . only bad thing game howie repeats same thing several times one game it starts get old . but considering how small controller/console/game , i'm just glad it voicework music it . definitely recommended anyone who loves show	1
grand daughter wanted drums .... she starting thesecomparable keyboard	1

this such cute picnic table boy or girl -you can't beat price too ! table top swivels so it becomes art desk which great artist family -if you one , which we ! not extremely easy put together , but it doesn't take genius or mechanic , either . also , don't plan seating four little ones , only two , but us , that great !	1
i use this game classroom math support teacher home my kids . all kids love it it moves good pace . i appreciate how game doesn't just let kids always decide what combination coins they'll use represent certain value . when they spin spinner , it sometimes land no dimes or no nickels , so . so they need figure out how make certain amount without those coins	1
we bought pair these handy easel paper pads pull them out rainy or snowy days . kids love using markers , crayons , foam stickers , glitter glue , whatever they get their hands , large 17x20 inch working space they create their masterpieces hours . this great price you afford buy one each kid everyone happy ! we didn't bother buying easel stand since our kids like spreading out floor space . stand up easel better used when painting	1
our 2 1/2 year old loves this product ! my only gripes so far jump sensor ( interactive games)requires constant readjustment , it takes up lot space ( not foldable ) , assembly instructions horrible ( took two people hour assemble ) . product itself sturdy most-used x-mas gift my son received this year	1
this different format than other shout games we played past . it even better than before ! we played teams enjoyed 2 full games without stopping . it brought back lots memories shows we all loved past	1
i played this game 20 adults 40th birthday party . we all great time . we divided into two groups : men vs women . great ice breaker people who don't know each other very well . we all something talk afterwards very informed . i bought rest shout games	1
i don't recommend this product . it gets locked up easily it hard 4 year old figure out how get it unjammed . my son got so annoyed it he doesn't even attempt play it anymore	-1
i thought this toy adorable . it great learning toy math , but it also fun dramatic play ! two toys one ! this toy also great practicing fine motor skills . all cookies big white number bottom , directly correlated number mm top . so , you count top mm or work number recognition using bottoms . my 18 month old daughter also still obssessed " put take . " so she spends lots time just doing this cookies . i one slight issue this toy - top cookie jar doesn't fit well i'd like . it never truly sits place correctly , although it sit top cookie jar . i'm not sure if this manufacturing problem or if it shipping problem . it looks like jar very slightly bent into oblong shape , which why i think top won't fit . this could simply shipping issue just me though . i've tried bending it back , but haven't any luck . either way , educational fun toy	1
h(oward ) p(hillips ) lovecraft wrote whole bunch short stories pulp magazines such " weird tales , " many which talked great cthulhu , supremely powerful force evil who laying dormant deep beneath pacific ocean , awaiting time when he would return power turn earth into waste land . lovecraft stories great old ones , cursed book called " necronomicon , " scholars miskatonic university , elder gods developed into what now commonly known cthulhu mythos ( term coined august derleth ) . other writers added cthulhu mythos , which continues expand this day , but heart it all cthulhu himself . so idea he turned into 8-inch plush toy takes concept cuteness damp , dark hole where it not seen light day countless years . cthulhu ( a.k.a. fisherman god , great old one , him who lies dreaming , him who rise again , etc . ) described lovecraft follows : " monster vaguely anthropoid outline , but octopuslike head whose face mass feelers , scaly , rubbery-looking body , prodigious claws hind fore feet , long , narrow wings behind . " addition " fearsome unnatural malignancy , " cthulhu described " somewhat bloated corpulence , " which certainly explains why it ended up plush toy , although i am not certain how accurate green part ends up . given literary heritage cthulhu , it amazing how much fun lovecraft greatest monstrous creation . there cthulhu president t-shirts , campus crusade cthulhu , marvelous on-line comic strip , " misadventures hello cthulhu " ( yes , think " hello kitty " unknowable evil walking around ) . i even seen cthulhu made out lego parts ( lego squid makes such things possible apparently ) . so cthulhu plush toy seems rather reasonable , one those brilliant examples how commercial impulse manifest itself diverse sections popular culture . plush toys nyarlathotep azathoth far behind ? stay tuned , boys girls .	1
classic fire truck -- large enough , some details , my boys feel like it real fire truck . i like fact it doesn't move its own -- you push it . sounds not too loud ( some may disagree , but i've heard louder ) . ladder hasn't broken yet , but it pretty thin plastic , so it probably break eventually . doors open put small characters .	1
he spends hours his day playing firetruck . it worth money . gives me couple hours sanity everyday !!! angie hac	1

i daughter going into kindergarten next year . my wife i bought her leappad two software modules it christmas last year thinking it would help her get bit head start before starting school . while my daughter doesn't play this her own , she likes using this software me or my wife . it seems like she introducing us characters she liked cars all things they this software . allowing her " show us around " , she learned quite bit this software . she seems fun it kid , fact she learning very satisfying me parent . i think leappad good job here	1
excellent toy interactive too !! reviewer gave it bad rating obviously bitter uninformed she obviously doesn't any hands experience this toy looking outlet vent out her frustrations	1
i read reviews " " sounding like " " . my son got this christmas gift pronunciation clear appropriate . perhaps they changed it newer ones	1
my 1 year old granddaughter got this bear christmas . it not worked right except day . after reading all reviews i am beginning think i just happened purchase bad one . course , she not age she use this toy herself . but we took it out box turned it her , voice startled her first , but she gotten used it . next day we turned it her it skipping pages . we took batteries out put new ones i turned it her today now it just keeps repeating page one . i older grandchildren very rough kept tj out their reach because i am afraid they break his arms . anyone else any problems this toy ? i am afraid buy any more books until i see if hasbro replace this bear one see if it works	-1
we bought this our daughter when she younger . it too frustrating . ants not made like they once it near impossible get them into pants . we would cheat her pretend they went after long while trying . even we could not get them . plus material so cheesy they break very easily . save your money buy better game instead	-1
i can't say enough these toys ! they so nicely made feel great your hands . small enough carry around big enough little hands . great quality , sturdy superior look . collectors buying these up like hot cakes ebay living proof people willing shell out cash these . especially ones harder find . people written reviews these no stores carry them . they sold out because there rush these toys even before movie release . hopefully time goes if they keep producing them they easier come . that what i am hoping . i don't all characters yet would like least one each my son , maybe even more collecting . good luck your search	1
where begin ??? this toy after setup , didn't last 15 minutes before breaking . ball return quit working literally after 15 minutes . ( my 2 6 year old very disappointed ) . " floor " bowling alley painted garbage bag -- how thin material . plastic tubes running sides only rest few plastic holders only place stickers/ velcro . nevertheless , these tubes constantly fell apart come undone . there 3 power wires running all over game . 1 scorer , 1 ball return , 1 pins --- ones pins ball return don't fit into their female receptacle properly ( they hang loose stick out 1/4 " . pins aren't pins . they aren't round , they cut half hollowed out . two bowling balls come this smaller than softballs plastic . i don't know what else say , i 1 , 2 , 6 , 8 year old thousands toys . this first one i said quality this toy complete garbage i must take time get internet figure out how leave review , because this toy wins award biggest piece garbage ever !!!!!	-1

we found this great toy . it actually works , unlike terrain twister . shell shocker durable , goes fast , spins around , opens closes its fins goes through just anything . it actually power . this fun toy . i dont think i would put it through mud or water though . i wouldnt want clean mud out it most rc type toys dont work well after getting them wet . we chase dog around yard it too , pretty fun . you need buy battery it cost $30.00 we've it 6 months love it , really cool toy	1
this bionicle visorak series stands among best ideas lego ever pursued . it clever , inventive , just plain fun ! i haven't kept up bionicle story over years . i always just liked action figures . bohrok very cool , rahkshi . i began lose interest bionicle when vahki came scene , but i still collected few them . far i tell , dynamic bionicle stories usually same . heroic , robotic toa versus horde monsters . that pretty much what going here . visorak cute four-legged monsters large pincers . there nine them here , they fighting against six elemental toa ( humanoid robots ) . it should noted toa figures not posable like other lego minifigs . they're more like mini figurines . each guy stands his own heroic pose , each guy carries his own unique silver weapon . there spears , halberds , battering rams . i'll forgive lack posability here because rest this set so cool . there six different visoraks ( they different styles pincers ) . this set comes nine them ( i get extra one mistake ? other sets come eight ) . three cute little monsters duplicates . they're made semi-flexible plastic . you push down monster back spring him into battle knock down robots . very cool . visorak also glow dark . both toa visorak figures some great textured detail , visorak some very nice color detail well . we also get larger visorak who i haven't seen before . he no pincers like his smaller buddies . just small tusks like elephant . like other visoraks , he four-legged monster . he constructed technic bionicle parts . pushing down his back raises his head reveal spring-loaded missile launcher sof t-t ip missile ( it also fires missile ) . colors dark blue , dark gray , he gold head piece . this guy isn't quite cool visorak queen battle metru nui set , but he appealing uniqueness . backdrop our frenzied melee monsters robots tall tower big black mask front gateway . above entrance tower grated window flipped open reveal spring-loaded missile launcher turntable . this one fires silver sof t-t ipped missile . launcher turn left right , raise lower aim , it also move back forth rails . high atop tower target our large visorak aim hopes knocking it over . tower also opening doors ground level , manually operated catapult launch flaming boulder . finishing touch some vines our little monsters use scale walls . little visoraks snapped firmly onto vine . going into construction tower mostly regular lego pieces , just few technic parts used catapult . colors primarily dark gray black . tower also ornamental blades silver spruce up look , toa mask , some torches , some really nice flame pyres , we get decorative decals opening doors mask gateway . this set lot tiny white horn/spikes . i found construction here easy enough . nothing too challenging . finished model sturdy easily portable . this set isn't quite action packed other bionicle visorak playsets , but it still visorak charm . added plus tower connected metru nui . i say , all sets this series great ! this kind thing i like most . lots guys cool weapons , lots cute little monsters , really nice techno-stronghold cool action features so i stage epic battle . my verdict : thumbs up	1
i got this my son he fun it , but i spent lot time trying unjam coins mechanism . actual coin sorter it stinks . number coins ( or even types coins ) end up each roll fairly inconsistent . also , it comes top keep little fingers out it , but there no way keep top , so my son got his finger caught rotating coin sorter once pretty scared until i could pry his finger out it . i wouldn't reccomend it	-1

okay , concept this game cube great , believe me : you spend many hours trying solve this puzzle . now reality ... i first tried this brain buster eighties when it came out . upon its first release , stickers stayed , plastic squares didn't break off , it just seemed like higher quality piece . i beleive plastic might heavier . but now , twenty years later , stickers peal off , squares pop out . junk , junk , junk ! if this made usa it would now cost more than it manufactured over seas , however ... it wouldn't junk . you get what you pay . stephen john becciaauthor treelanders	-1
they're stickers , stickers peel , get over it . what , ya expect paint job like car or something ? what next , pimp my cube ha ?!?! ( like reality tv show , pimp my ride) ?!?! i really like cutely packaged anniversary edition . makes very nice display . if you get anniv edition ya don't want ruin it , then i suggest ya keep anniv edition displayed shelf also buy 2nd cheaper version . no biggy	1
i recieved this shower gift before my son born . toys included great throughout his first year . we use toys beach toys now my son 2 . his favorite part alligator sprays water . i like toys all brightly colored instead usual light blue or pink most baby toys . only down side i found storage containers no drainage bottoms so you dry all toys before putting them away	1
i got this pool our back garden - i toddler i'm heavily pregnant - i wanted pool comfortable both us sit . it perfec t.t he aircushioned bottom great letting my toddler jump land splash around without hurting himself , sides robust enough me lean against . also they robust enough him lean against outside play his boats pool ( obviously only when supervised ! ) because cushioned bottom , i could quite easily spend hours justing sitting there ; it really comfortable . we got little electric pump it took no time pump up , although it takes while empty water out bottom valve , you it without any effort ( no heaving tugging turn it upside down ) . we're really happy it	1
we use this pool indoors ball pit . it perfect size our playroom inflatable bottom which makes it comfortable kids they're rolling around inside . can't comment its use swimming pool but it makes fantastic ball pit	1
i gave this my 10-month-old niece , she loves it . it really three toys one , so it hold baby interest long time	1
first all , price listed here amazon.com cheaper than toys'r'us or even wal-mart ... otherwise , i think it ridiculous pay more than ten bucks this toy . medium large cubes each opening one side , so you place small cube within medium cube , medium cube within large cube . they stick up out each other just enough little fingers pull them out , or you just dump them upside down . if you turn them upside-down , they become stackable . we got this our son when he four months old teach him hand-eye coordination ... he learned stack them before he could place them inside each other . ( my son kind kid who learned open our dogs ' kennel latches before he figured out how get rings his cone toy . ) he still plays cubes , he thirteen months old now . his favorite piece always small cube because it rattles inside . big cube mound " bananas " inside , medium one tree stump - both great exploring tiny fingertips . he likes putting some his other peek-a-blocks inside medium large cubes ... small cube works toys like peek-a-block goldfish . this toy also easy clean , which makes it great " sharing " toy playdates . it also nice way carry " three toys one " your diaper bag without taking up much space	1

we just purchased this game our 3 1/2 year old daughter she got pretty bored it after few rounds placing beans top pot . explaining how game works doesn't really matter - she just thinks if beans fall her side , she wins ! alone priceless . i like fact this game teaches her wait her turn when she playing someone only place one bean time - patience . i played this game kid , it seemed entire plastic pot holder so much thinner lighter than 30 years ago . i guess comes technology newer raw materials . scale 1 10 , i rate this toy 5 . it great toy if it around 30 years ! just keep things simple your little ones - they may not engage this toy more than 30 minutes , but it better than alot other games out there 3 year olds .	-1
other magic sets all too difficult my 8 year old son , so we tried this one mainly because it stated it " beginners " . my son loves it now working mastering his technique performance rather than spending time frustrated because he cannot tricks begin . i disagree others who felt some items flemsy . i feel all contents built well enough easy assemble use . instructions easy understand tricks fun watch .	1
this kit directions equipment ten magic tricks . some items made paper seem bit flimsy . i agree previous reviewer who said stacking boxes needed some reshaping . however , overall , this great kit . my son worked hard practicing practicing showing off his magic tricks . we one day few days running . it taught him work practice it helped him practice his speaking public ( since he performed everyone ! )he able complete most magic tricks little help after one demonstration . lots fun . enjoy .	1

nothing brings people together like games uno one best because it appeals such wide range age . everyone grampa his 1st grade grand daughter play lots fun laughs . what better than ?	1
what great game ! rules simple enough pretty young kids play , it entertaining whole family . there slight bit strategy , there times when one must make decision , unload cards selfishly or use reversals or draws work alliance , batter leader . bit strategy , more strategy than card game like war , where fate decided final cut cards , just ceaselessly played out robotic fashion . but uno game chance , it unfolds enough pick cards savvy five year old should almost equal footing adult . play game dialogue sorts . it serves wonderfully play therapy . nice resistant child who not open up his or her inner world , but engage game . you sit silence , responding card card , there communication . communication , start alliance . there also , i've only recently discovered , real cult uno out there , numerous variations , things like " ascending rules uno , " " pirate uno , " " speed uno , " " slovenian uno , " even one called " cut throat uno ( not title appeals me play therapy ) , " well solitaire versions uno , i guess no-shows or lonely nights .	1

my family i avid scrabble players looked forward trying new super scrabbble edition . we , however , sorely disappointed . only thing " super " it it super-long . while it great idea add more letters , higher points per word larger board , end product seemed inferior edition , hastily manufactured largely untested . manufacturer simply added border existing scrabble game board . new higher point squares all near periphery so it takes some game time able use them . board itself flimsy too large comfortably swivel each player takes their turn . it would better it turning pedestal similar deluxe edition . there many more tiles this board . it would nice tile pockets board hold them all place - again like deluxe edition . score pad too short length this game increased number tiles should larger bag same size bag makes it harder pass mix . we tried giving each player nine , instead standard seven , tiles but tile holder too short this comfortable . short , we not recommend this new version . it compares unfavorably deluxe scrabble edition	-1
family already loves scrabble super scrabble great addition ! gave it gift it received joy . it opened immediately game underway . great fun . higher scores	1

my 4 yr . old son obsessed his cars trucks especially cars movie . he constantly racing his growing collection cars trucks around house i began think he might enjoy track race them . my husband fond memories hot wheels track he when he boy suggested some friends family might make good gift him . he receive couple different hot wheels tracks , but they proved too complicated difficult my son set up run himself my husband afraid constantly buying batteries would prove quite expensive . after doing some research , i finally settled this cars lightning fast speedway track set . i knew it would only work his diecast cars cars movie not smaller hot wheels cars , but i figured it would good way introduce him using race track his cars we could worry getting track his hot wheels cars when he older . besides i knew he would love it , because he loves cars movie so much . i right . this definitely right track my son right now . it one piece which means there no complicated track pieces him figure out how assemble him scatter all over house . it also folds up which makes it easy store move around . on/off switch bit stiff but he it himself . he also place cars start ramp himself he loves watch them race around track . he also loves when crash middle . track works best 2 cars time , but it also works reasonably well 3 or 4 cars time long batteries fresh . only thing doesn't seem work advertised hand pedal increase or decrease speed . it doesn't seem really anything all when he pushes it down or pulls it up , but my son doesn't seem care this all . he just likes watch cars race crash . not all cars diecast vehicles work this track . ones designed race cars work great - lightning , chick , king , doc etc . some cars aren't race cars but similar shape also work fairly well - sally , sheriff etc . - though they sometimes get little hung up their way around track slow things down or crash . other characters such mater , filmore , ramone , luigi , guido , red etc . don't work all . however , doesn't seem bother my son much . he just turns motor off races them around track hand . he races his hot wheels tonka town trucks around track hand well . overall , i'm very happy this purchase i believe my son too . he played it every day since he received it over week ago , i haven't replace batteries yet - though i think they slowing down bit now . i definitely reccommend this track set any child 3-5 yrs old who not ready traditional hot wheels track who loves cars movie cars	1
my 12 month old loves anything elmo it . she loves lights turning pages . this keeps her entertained awhile , something not so common her	1
my daughter recieved this gift her first christmas her grandmother went nuts . this most played toy million she . thank you elmo !	1
my son loves this toy . it bright , durable , it plays lots songs it easy batteries ( our first set toy came lasted almost whole year frequent use ) . one key moves elmo head back forth , one key spins dorothy ( fish ) around her bowl , other keys move whistle-shaped figures up down . song book flips three different levels fun . only complaint i key spins dorothy also key moves elmo head too stiff baby or even younger toddler push himself . ~ sta	1
neca continues get very cool licenses their movie figures , continued where mcfarlane started . fact i prefer their figures mcfarlane ones . however they some problems . sometimes their figures won't stand up . such this one . only way get him stand lean him up against wall . design this figure his feet positioned weird angle . fact whole stance figure looks off . pushing button back figure play freddy jump rope song . yes , thats cool , but it pain activate due fact you lean this figure against wall . it also comes optional demon head , which you replace freddy head . honestly , if you want large freddy figure display , track down older mcfarlane one . you pay lot more , but it lot better sculpt than this one it based better nightmare film ( nightmare part 1 ) . or just buy 7 " figure neca recently re-released	-1

personally , i am bionicle freak . when i saw first bionicle set 6 original toa , i knew i would pretty much anything get them . ( if you wondering i am 13 years age ) course i ended up loving them time , i bonkers bionicle . you parents who read this , you probably thinking these lego models just item your child want so badly , play week or so , never touch again . this completely different matter . these aren't your ordinary action figures , these fun build play you use your imagination make new things out them any time you wish . plus they not brake easily . ( if you've gone through conflict mommy-my-toy's-arm-broke-off ) if your child loves build things , remarkable immagination , likes various colorful action heroes , ( my apologies those going through power rangers phase ) bionicle toa toa nuva worthy title , " must-have " . educational well , your child learn few basics simple machines motors well . thank you reading my review , i just hope my mother reads it	1
we leappad plus writing couple years now . when it works it great my kids love it . durabily awful ! we now our 5th or 6th pen it . this must problem most them since last time i called company they autimatically stated one phone options you get up 2 free pens it ( cost $5 s/h each pen -another $10 bucks down drain when it actually only costs them probably $1 ship mail . ) pen so sensitive sometimes it seems work ok then others like bones body- you touch bone it give you wrong answer . books lot fun educational but we paid $80 this when it first came out we own probably 7 book ($15 average per book)and if leap pad isn't working books waste ) . last time i used this my son it started off working fine then all sudden pen wouldn't recognize anything . i called co . they told me they would give me 1/2 off new leap pad plus writing book . i thought kind stupid considering i already one obviously isn't working wouldn't spend money getting new one same problems . they suggest when problems pen clean prongs alcohol - this never worked me . it might okay buy if pen wasn't attached book because it seems every little tug you need new pen . i am debating getting new leapster l-max , but am worried it also problems . very disappointed leappad plus writing	-1

if you planning serve your eager children half cup chilled but still liquid halfhalf sugar seaweed it but thought making them wait half hour first would increase enjoyment , fine . but don't bother buying this item because assembly , clean up expense waste your time money . two cautions : because it child oriented activity it not those who use occasional swear word everyone should wear safety goggles case you decide smash device into even more pieces . this review based several trials . thanks refill packs , gift giver	-1

this toy really rude ! it says " outta way " other very rude phrases . i can't believe anyone would produce toy like this think it okay . this toy got home bottom garbage	-1
i wish i seen these reviews before buying this obnoxious toy my 10 month old christmas . i agree what other reviewers saying ; this toy barks rude orders like " outta way ! " demands you " fill ' er up !! " extremely snotty voice . it sing couple traditional tunes , such alphabet song , but even singing voice attitude . so unless you want your little guy or gal learn poor driving manners , steer clear this toy ( no pun intended) !	-1
this my fourth lego star wars set , i must say , i enjoyed it very much . not only it fascinating piece together , but i even fun playing it after it assembled . i started x-wing . intricate set gears rubberbands work mechanism slowly opens closes wing formation . it so interesting watch pile plastic come together into working , simple machine . i find it bit repetative assemble all four parts wings , however . details ship include variety appropriate colors textures . i pleased final look . however , anyone wishing any excessive play this toy should expect some less secure pieces pop off occasionally . i then moved yoda hut . this my favorite toy set . it opens closes , either formation looks like appropriate home yoda . it includes little fire pot , mug pitcher , barrel , even small bed . my favorite thing hut bed top swings away reveal yoda hidden light saber . even yoda himself highly detailed head appropriate shortened body . i pieced together hut , i issues pieces falling off , but completely finished model perfectly stable . this set very enjoyable put together . it variety moving parts play . details pieces make it seem right out star wars universe . it perfect lego set either display or playtime .	1

this set composed five main sub assemblies dragon , should take 4 hours ( or more ) complete . it comes six mini-figures number operational catapults , inner keep , main gate . lego integration technic parts never better than last few years , like all their recent sets , number one feeling one gets one extreme cleverness . ( one point building this set i said aloud " this exactly what vikings would if they technic parts back then . " ) concerns rest this series , ship similarly awe inspiring boat , catapult , wolf sets make excellent additions battlefield . only thing one could wish enemy series pit vikings against . though all mythical creatures well designed look impressive , it would nice array viking sets ( boats especially ) against competing force , none current sets good match	1
this great version game . we got this our 11 year old son it fun play . it easier than regular edition ( no surprise ) . really nice thing it multiple choice -- each question three options choose . instructions simple questions good , wide range interests . definitely recommended children families	1
display only stayed bright enough read clearly 3 weeks . i turn sound off so writing would " appear " . otherwise , it wonderful ! second set batteries already going out now . i recommend playing without sound so they last longer	1

we bought this our 7 months old she not like it all . there really nothing amuse her . we placed some toy it , but still nothing her . if you looking somewhere place your child listen them scream boredom ... then here your two stars . far bouncing , this not good idea . there really no support walls this item . bouncing 18-20 pounder not good idea . bouncer never sat straight , it always tilt it . maybe packaging . also , toy hung wrong overhead well . we now 4 months later ( not much use ) throwing it out !!! somewhere , it sprung leak we cannot seem find it either . so , overall ... this not one our better choices	-1
this worst children game i've ever seen -- bar none . i am few months away completing phd i can't understand/remember confusing directions ... you imagine how frustrating it my 4 year-old her friends ? game so complicated so devoid fun we never finished it , whenever we play it , everyone ends up unhappy . ditto what everyone writes cheapness construction pain-in-the-butt set-up . i hope disney pulls this market -- it so awful i am not even going give it goodwill , i'm just going trash it	-1
my daughter likes it , but only because she unusually high level patience . her friends refuse play it after they tried unsuccesfullly finish game . 30 minutes into it they nowhere near even middle game set friends who quiet calm . i would never pull this game out some her other more rambunctious friends . please not this game	-1
my daughter got this toy when she 6 months old . time she could pull out shapes , bounce birdies push big counting button . now she 16 months old match shapes into correct spots still enjoyings bouncing birds counting pond . great toy !! one few she enjoyed nearly year ! rare ! not worth paying $60 here though ... go bru or walmart	1
both my handicapped 8 year old son my 15 month old absolutely love this toy !! it taught my 15 month old sort now he uses his block box sorting instead throwing !! even older kids i take care enjoy playing this toy . music warm nature sounds very clear . only problem i tips sorting blocks break when stepped ... * lol * other than this wonderful addition our toy collection !	1
i toddler who very picky toys , i hard-pressed find one keeps his attention . he received this little tool set christmas loves it . he into more mechanically oriented toys , naturally , so it up his alley . but set well-crafted easy him use . drill actually drills screws interchangeable bits . our little guy pretends he bob builder yellow hard-hat . i can't vouch longevity this toy , since we've only it month or so , but it neat little tool-set held up lot abuse so far	1

i've playing kismet my friend house since childhood , what great game ! they recently taught me easy way spice up game ... add strategy required win ! here it : each game sheet columns six games . instead playing one game time , you play 3x or 6x . obviously , each longer time commitment other . say you're playing kismet 3x - you play three games all once . when you're finished , game 1 column score remains ( 1 ); multiply game 2 column score 2 ( x2 ); multiply game 3 column score 3 ( x3 ) . then , add those three totals together - this your final score ( could range 1500 - 3000 points or so ) . key here choosing which column input your different rolls . obviously , good rolls w/ high scores should fill up your game 3 column , b/c it going end up multiplied 3 . you want put your poor rolls game 1 column . try it , it fun !	1
my sister i played this game every night two months . it almost exactly like game yhatzee , but it colors thrown . there list sets get like : three kind , all same color , two pair . after you roll , you pick which dice you want roll again . you roll total 3 times see if you get any sets . it so fun because it so basic . not lot rules remember . we usually play 3 games night . also good travel since you really only need dice score cards ( maybe rolling cup ) . not good play when your parents trying sleep though ! dice really loud when rolling them cup . really fun game	1
i bought this my nephew christmas it one those toys he opened right away end night there dominoe trains all over kitchen . he kept us entertained	1

these cars so much fun ! just name says , you just shake it up it goes . my son several these they all slightly different reactions . some faster than others . they work best hard surface - cement , hardwood floors , tile . they go pretty slow carpet . cars very durable . one my son favorite games launch them off deck see if he get it land grass below . if weather isn't nice , he likes send them racing down stairs . so far , nothing broken its over six months . these cars easy my daughter ( who only two ) play too . kids love shaking cars racing see who car goes farthest .	1
i agree first review , it tough open . my daughter puts all her hair ties things like inside , so when we're getting ready school , it pain get open . music adorable , design itself well . necklace comes it , course cheap fell apart quickly . overall , if your daughter loves cinderella , she love this toy	1
car fun toy our 22 month old . she little trouble steering it but she getting hang it . it moves just fine our berber carpet also works fine outside- even grass . overall it great little car perfect young toddlers because it doesn't go too fast very simple operate . cons : back tires spin zero traction . also , stickers already peeling off it 3 weeks old	1
this game two four players , more better . there not too many games you play six players . this keeps all ages interested , even my seven year old . we thought he too young , but he won ! he seemed think most money way go , not buying much it . it total pokerface , he bluffing whole time making us think he really didn't get game he felt most money would win , but he ended up tricking us winning . we all stunned . we so much fun we actually continued game whoever left game . even parent it challenging play against kids . some games you sake interaction your kids , but this one hold your interest	1

i really wanted like this game , but there serious problems version comes blue box . 1 . pegs fall out vertical board . this serious game play issue because you cannot tell where you fired or scanned . 2 . voice very difficult understand . i cannot emphasize this enough ... not buy version blue box . it stinks . i able contact hasbro ( not easy feat because their phone line constantly busy , you wait hold ten minutes their operators hung up me twice [ accidentally i hope ] before i got speak them ) , they sent me entirely new unit green box . buy version green box ; it great ( just don't use it elevated mode ; keep it flat table )	-1
this dvd contains six rounds . questions same everytime you play round . so once you've played one rounds , you know all answers . price , sux . i expected different random questions every game , not so . i bought this game because it packaged like it rock based game . ( guy les paul guitar front box , lollapalooza sample question back , it comes hard rock cafe poster which box game their logo all over it ) so i bite . then game questions country artist clay aiken rapper 50 cents . what up ? plus game main theme music c+c music factory " gonna make you sweat " . it still rather enjoyable , except dvd kept freezing up . so overall , avoid it unless you find it five bucks or less !!	-1
we hadn't played any new dvd games until this past weekend . one party we played shout movies riff . we hated shout ( i am posting our review ! ) we loved riff . riff completely dvd . you play teams use dvd remote . best part battle bands questions which went people screaming laughing . high or lower fact or wack parts game most original stuff we seen . loved this . then there music videos , picture questions , music . what really great how much stuff current music this game . how much stuff we managed actually remember . there other stuff too . look inside hard rock collection very cool . so poster included . but star game . we went out bought our own copy next day . we can't wait play it again ( this weekend . ) riff amazing !!!	1

this renditionof hot rod ( also known rodimus ) one gems transformers : classics toyline . this toy suprisingly solid both forms attention detail quality impressive . his car mode looks most like his g1 cartoon/movie version than any other classics transformers except perhaps starscream . i especially like way his gun turns into jet engine ( like one batmobile ) rear car car mode . one worst things original transformers keeping track their accessories , but this latest line toys weapons usually integrated into vehicle mode somehow . this one best examples integration . only thing i could really find nitpick this toy lack autobot symbol hood , but isn't nearly enough keep me giving this toy 5 stars its great transformation , solid feel amazing poseability ( especially compared original	1
rodimus homage generation 1 autobot hot rod , who later became rodimus prime transformers animated movie 1986 . transformation bit tricky , few connections finagled back forth before they become lose . one careful when putting feet position , it not readily obvious it stabilizers within main part feet flip out behind robot . once correctly , rodimus stands quite nicely stablely . gun shoot it missle , but not more than 18 inch range . all all , nice solid toy .	1
this such cute little box , but , most importantly , chocolates great ! they kinda squishy melty , they taste like they're custard-filled . why spend your money something see or sweet factory when you just buy this ? besides , it educational . when you chew chocolate it gets all mushy ... that what i call " cause effect ! " my only complaint it smells little poopy . this product you must buy !!!	1

im not understanding how so many parents outraged songs tape . " stacy mom " song sunny delight commercials pete sake ! when i hear it , i picture boy innocent crush stacy mom . im not over thinking it neither kids . kid thinks " stacy mom got it going " so what ?? what you people thinking ? outkast " hey ya " song .... song virtually everywhere , its even few kids bop cd . you really think child knows what meant " dont wanna meet your momm-a , just wanna make you cumm-a ? kids know what word means ? no , my children certainly dont ! so why worry ?? i think parents definitely over think project their adult knowledge into child . children think simply , they arent worldly or knowledgeable such things . " dont want meet your daddy , i just want you my caddy " ... i doubt kids age even know what caddy never mind why he wants her back it ! when i kid i singing " push it " salt pepa . i no idea what they talking but i liked song . course now i know what song am shocked i sang it 9-10 years age but song way more sexuallity it . maybe i just raised different generation or maybe i just let kids kids sing songs all over our countries airwaves anyway . censor censor censor .... kids exposed it anyway , might well relax put letter writing campaign rest . really , its not bad people	1

i purchased bubba bottom feeder game after reading instructions back box . i grew up playing all kinds cheap pool games my grandma pool , most them some type ring toss game , or you dive certain items scattered across bottom while your siblings desperately try stop you getting last one . bubba bottom feeder bit different- it set up like -reverse- dive game . " bubba " big fish big green weighted lips who sinks bottom pool . ( his lips also hinged , making nice carrying case other parts game ! ) his body made mesh net , probably safety reasons- so everything dry quickly when game over . game also comes several adorable little round plastic fish , each one weighted slightly different size ping pong ball . most float surface , while some sink slightly below . object then gather these little fish , one time , " feed " them bubba , resting bottom . each fish he fed causes him get little lighter -- until finally he eats " too much " floats surface , game start again . person feed him fish makes him float- wins . ( i think . ) it no means hours fun , but it nice spin dive games , concept feeding big fish well thought out ( it would much less fun putting ping pong balls underwater net , example)the construction pretty good inexpensive pool game well- i only worry bubba hinged lips breaking where plastic gets fairly thin . overall though this great little summer pool toy price , nice sense humor ( maybe teaches kids not overfeed pet fish ? ) quite fun kids	1

while this newer editions look almost exactly same , i assure you they not . aside playing them , which fun they what else you dominoes general ( build small house or so ) , dominoes you'll get not originals . original version " item 707 " written bottom weighs more than 2lbs its lunchbox very noticeably heavier than its newer counterpar t.t he new version " item 00707 " written bottom weighs around 1lb . what this mean ? well , original version dominoes made dense ivory or bone ( i don't know much them , but they thick ceramic-like dominoes ) . newer ones hollow plastic feel cheap - you crack them if you apply fair amount pressure or accidentally step them . original , however , you toss through car window hurt someone . so before you order , ask merchant specifically what bottom pale says ; they won't know real difference , but if it doesn't say " item 707 , " you're not getting your money worth ( they cost same , original may discontinued ) . fyi , i ordered my original stuff kids like newer one entertainment earth ( both directly their respective website , not through amazon )	1

it big , apparently tough outdoor play , but nearly 3 year old , very limited what it . even adult , i found crane mechanism difficult manipulate hook system impractical use anything . ours came bunch heavy paper construction blocks you put together , intended use crane hook , but they don't fit it , so they're useless . plastic tabs some them insert hook rail , but even isn't very functional . crane winding knob too difficult small child also . only 3 big tonkas available now kids play outside , this big disappointment set . only mighty dump truck really good toy kids , even loader little going it . crane definitely worst , though . not tonkas my youth , that sure	-1
my 3 yr old son likes this only because its big wheels because he put stuff ( other toys small cars ) into bed . like other reviewers said , crane doesn't work very well piece supposed hold cars or whatever you pick up comes off very easily . he basically using it like dump truck ... he wanted crane though	-1
my daughter ( 2 ) actually fell love one these display target heartbroken when we found out they sold out them weeks . she plays her " kitty " all time , often rest us tempted pet it just hear cute noises it makes . only annoying thing mechanical noises it makes when it moving , but i guess can't helped	1

i purchased this tuesday morning one dollar 99 cents . it well worth it ! my son loves it ! little car wooden but train car mostly plastic . son train lover so 1.99 we indulge him . brio durable brand but more plastic pieces thomas friends brand mainly wooden . only fall back me . it pulls perfectly behind thomas , percy gordon . it same scale thomas so they work beautifully together !	1

i'm not impressed quality this marble set because blocks which curved tunnel carved roughly there only one way set them up so marble doesn't just stop tunnel . if inside tunnel smooth more carefully designed , marbles would roll like they should . when i kid , i fantastic wooden marble run set , but nothing market seems equivalent . most sets holes lengthy pieces marbles drop through . i think without holes there more possibilites set up . however , my four year old enjoy this set . i play her shown her how change set up when marble stops .	-1

i am very impressed this game . it my birthday present . i really love little clones droids . it perfect star wars fan . i hope my review helped you	1
i loved star wars risk since i kid combination two awesome . star wars risk very different traditional risk . example : you can't back stab your partner take whole world -- er -- galaxy yourself but keeping star wars : light side good dark side bad . game play very ballanced ( despite initial appearances ) but some traditional risk strategies may not work so well . first all light side must act quickly capture many sepratist leaders ( new rules ) possible instead trying take whole galaxy force . need haste comes power darkside declare executive order 66 ( more new rlues ) thus turning whole lightside worlds troops dark side . i seen complaints unbalanced rules eo66 powerful tool evil but light side win ; it just requires speed some new strategies . when i play variant game i want game similar but different than its parent game i think this nearly perfect risk variant . very different but great .	1

we just bought this adorable puppy today my daughters could hardly wait get him out box . after placing 3 aa 1 batter him , he ready play . i found his bark wasn't too loud not annoying i thought it may . he barks wags his tail when pet his head , back or tummy . he gets excited , his nose gets cold . he even gives kisses . ( makes kissing sound ) . if you touch his nose he sneeze too . what i really like he automatically turns off after minute or so if he stops getting played . i love this automatic shut off function save battery life . puppy very cuddly , legs soft . it doesn't feel like robotic dog all . this big hit my house so far !	1

this versionof optimus prime supposed look more like cartoon optimus than original toy . well far hasbro intention , i can't say they very successful . what they , however , create very affordable very sturdy new optimus prime toy more common original cartoon than more recent incarnations prime . toy very solid , feels like something you could play , unlike recent titanium series 2oth anniversary prime . transformation very solid not difficult pull off , posability robot pretty much top notch . my only gripes design truck mode ( headlights look weird ) , no trailer , smokestacks/gun . it cool incorporate gun into truck mode , however gun doesn't resemble primes gun all , flat square smokestaks just look bad . also doors truck attached prime forearms , which just kind strange , but it doesn't look bad ( just strange way go , when they say they trying make toy look more like original cartoon ) . there gun made wind deflector top truck , but it also doesn't look like primes gun , long enough look silly robots hands	1
bratz rock angelz concert stage pretty good toy , i mean it doesn't fall apart it doesn't too many pieces , but i would just get band instrumentz because it , well , more instruments ! it also way less money , i mean $20 versus $50	1

couldn't find them ( simple , non-battery operated light saber ) anywhere columbus - everyone sold out ! we bought my son more expensive battery operated one because it only one available store , even though we went specifically get him cheaper light saber like his friend . found cheaper version online purchased it so my son husband could " fight " together . love it . loved price , too	1
this basically replica great low price . these things last , i promise you , they look much better then electronic lightsabers . these " basic " lightsabers : retract into handle . lock place so it only opens when you press activation switch . clip your belt , pocket , pants , ect . ease . basic better . trust me . may force you	1
great product great price . it nice both my daughters play same time . all under same station . i would recommend this product anyone kids 4-8 age	1
if you loved classic game operation you simpson fan , what could better ? homer operation game . his comments make you laugh . great game any age	1
i shoulda gotten something else . my son i used this entire summer , it never much fun . it smaller lighter than we would've liked . if it easier hold , weighes bit more , then when we aim throw thing into water , it should glide down least few seconds before slowly coming back up . it , it pops right up very close us no matter how hard or light we throw it , it doesn't matter angle descent , it so light it surfaces almost immediately	1
i bought this my daughter who one year old her sister 3 1/2 years old loves it just much younger one . it took my one year old week or two able turn knob make bear pop up . toy well made cute . it hit her birthday party too all kids older than her .	1

this given gift my 2 year old little girl . it very cute ! it doesn't take up much room you always fold it up tuck it away somewhere if need . only negative thing i say there little plastic pocket door , it ripped off very easily . i think it there so you could personalize boutique your childs name , not sure though . there cardboard insert window it becomes bent very easily . but price it very cute my little girl lots fun it .	1
you regret this purchase . unless , course , you not mind re-adjusting poles pulling it upright your child every 3 minutes ! however , if your child continually sit still inside never touch teepee itself , then this toy you ! my opinion , this item complete waste money . poles not stay place properly when children move inside . i constantly fix it so it would stand upright kids . not all durable . it up less than week when pole broke . material also ripped easily . wasn't even worth giving goodwill . it now takes up space some landfill . thought it would cute my little boy cowboy themed room . too bad , what waste	-1

it looks cute enough . picture it justice , but this didn't last us 9 months ! it took hours put together ... i am pretty good stuff ;) once together , it fine short while , but tiny screws hold table together completely come out wood ... unfixable . it shame . simple redesign table would make this charming set . complete waste my money broke my daughters heart when it fell apart . :	-1
it took me almost 3 months find this doll u.s ; only place i could find it originally uk . it difficult find ethnic doll when they available , they typically sold out within few days . my other daughter now bargaining her sister play baby born . only issue we encountered getting " tears " function work , which just well	1

... story activity wise , this great book my pre-schooler enjoyed . it features all characters show fits well concept underlying bear big blue house . reason i don't give it five stars because pages kinda thin age group whom book directed , so we really careful when giving it our four-year-old . given age group which it directed , i think this would better off my first leappad book rather than leappad book . but it great book younger kids enjoy	1

my daughter loves these speakers . they compact sound quite good . i gave these 4 rather than 5 because adapter nano not hold ipod securely other speaker systems i've seen . i'm concerned unless my daughter particularly careful when putting ipod or removing it dock , connector could bend or break . otherwise , this great little system	1
we went new year eve party adults some some teenage children found this great way include everyone - younger people could answer shows us older folks not even heard . our hosts gotten three cd set christmas one their grown children . it great fun - we all highly recommend it ! only downside those us who played it cannot play again .	1
i got this game , heard little it decided some friends over play it , all without trying it out first . we ended up loving it . everyone totally involved questions , which range easy obscure , making it much , much better than scene it , which takes too long too easy . we all shouting out movie titles , left right , great time . it section called still crazy , which takes still movies starts out background , then drops diff't parts , hats , chairs , until faces dropped , all while you guess what movie . it blast , very creative . it good game whether you film buff or just someone who wants go movies . so , if you're bunch people over holidays , this game get . all you need dvd player , remote tv , some friends play . you great time .	1
this not what i expected all , its granules silicone type stuff which makes most unbelievable mess . however , kids however loved it ! ( they've never seen real stuff . ) i got fed up cleaning them off my kitchen surfaces hid it cupboard end . save it summer yard or deck ! yuck !	-1
we played this friends it outstanding . it fun all ages . we played all adults it awesome , we all get dumbfounded we didn't get what we doing each others animals right away . so it fun make fun each other congrats each other also . if you better memory than your friends than this game you play them ... you win . kids it similar game memory great them build thought process ..	1
this game awesome ! we play it all time whenever our girls griends come over , they want play too ! you remember who what animal barn front them when you flip cards match , you guess what other person barn . first person guess gets give all their cards discard stack other person , goal get rid all your cards . really fun , great memory too	1
i love cabbage patch babies . i ordered this baby advertised page , thinking it would look just same . it red hair , but not purple outfit different hair style . my daughter personally picked this one out different one sent . i didn't know they send whatever may look similar . baby cute anyway - outfit probably not one i would picked if i saw it store .	1
i bought this my 27 month old son ( i know , he " too young " , blah , blah , blah ) we both love it . i no issues building it actually found no issues instructions either , maybe i'm smarter than average bear ??? my instructions tell me two power switches located annie , so maybe there two versions instruction sheets out there . my son loves it so far it functions stated . steam sounds very cool my wife looks kid me totally facinated . i only it week , but so far , if anything , steam thickened . only complaint i this point this thomas not detach second coach car ( annie ) , since annie car powers thomas forward provides power steam sounds . also , this thomas much faster than only other tomy engine we , so either duck slower than most or thomas faster than most . i wish they could made them all go least close same speed . this thomas catches up duck less than two circles around track . oh well , it still very fun cool .	1
my son who recently turned 3 years old loves this toy . my sister just gave it him birthday present yesterday . instructions not very clear . it took me some time figure out how make thomas work properly . it requires3 aa batteries , one bottom annie two top ( you need remove upper part insert batteries ) . this ok instructions , no problems all . after placing batteries , filling water tank thomas water , my son so frustrated see there no red light funnel it not making any sound , nor puffing steam . i thought it just matter waiting few minutes , but nothing happened . i noticed all water filled inside thomas came off bottom , i thought problem , but i think this supposed happen there place water stored left water tower , so i guess excess water really needs come out ( if you don`t want your floor wet , sure assist your child towel handy remove excess water stored bottom water tower everytime your child fills thomas water , or they may make it fall floor ) . after many attempts make thomas puff steam , i decided search internet instructions how use this toy i found manual line where i saw there on/off switch button bottom annie . i took my son`s train noticed this bottom off position , then i switched it position , placed thomas tracks , but then again , nothing happened . then i decided replace batteries new charged ones , voil� ! it began make sounds puff steam . instruction manual came toy doesn`t show this button picture or mention it anywhere . so if you purchased this toy it`s not working or if you going purchase it , check if this other button bottom switched , if it still not work , put new batteries ( requries 3 aa batteries ) . i think these tricks . you also need show your child how use it beginning . it important not fill funnel where steam comes out water ( i think children may want try put water there ) , there small whole thomas where water must poured into , but after i showed my son how use it , he learned it without problems . my son playing it all day it`s working very well . i only give 4 stars because instructions poor , but toy nice one works well . my son huge thomas tank fan , he lots trains hundreds tracks he really loves this steam train . if you looking present child , also consider buying wooden trains . my son loves these plastic trains , but he also loves wooden ones . they more expensive , but very nice children he seems interact more wooden trains . there also die cast trains , less expensive than wooden ones , but my son says he prefers wooden ones than diecast versions . he says steam thomas wooden ones his favorite . anyway , it varies child child . this what my son says he likes . :o )hope my review helpful	1
i love this toy so much . i got dalmation one christmas he so cute . he really what i tell him . well , sometimes he gets confused . like , sometimes he shakes even when i don't tell him . but i don't care . he howl . he shake . he'll play drop it . he beg little . he lay down . he sit up . i think this great toy all dog lovers	1
just others said their reviews , this not toy kids under 2 . i bit concerned spending $250+ toy where many reviewers not satisfied . but we promised this my daughter if she succeeded toilet training ( which she ) . she 2 3/4 yrs old , i thought she might too big based recommended age . " button " makes train go hard hold down , everyone said . it not like doorbell you would push . it more like bar you need squeeze , fingers top , thumb underneath . my daughter no problem it , but i would think any child under 2 1/2 would . she not too big it , i see her riding it while come . i would say recommended age should 2 1/2 - 4 . train seems stable , no tipping issues . only complaint they recommend charge battery after every use , which requires removal panel screwdriver . overall lots fun , but more attention should paid design . i would buy it again recommend it friend	1
other reviewer correct her assessment . this attractive doll . her hair great . she very angely if i may make up adjective . she beautifully packaged i collect barbies so i not taken her packaging , but i peaked her feet . i wanted see what they put her feet . i hoping she'd slippers or sandals . doll actually barefoot , which fine , but she not any toes ( no lines mark toes ) what i see . this my first collectible without shoes , so i don't know if that common or not . i've given her 4 because lack shoes my collection she falls middle . she great pink label though .	1
works just like description says . nemo other hand sank after first day	1

i'm parent 4 yr old 2 yr old , i inspired write this because few negative reviews i read here . any product few bad apples , which why we customer service departments , but i never experienced malfunctioning or poorly constructed geotrax element over 2 yrs buying stuff . my son club which regularly exchanges geotrax elements all other parents rave geotrax well . stuff takes beating kids this age , hard plastic geotrax stood up test flying colors . you get both electric trains non-electric trains/vehicles geotrax . you definitely should get rechargeable batteries ( aaa ) electric trains , since like any other small toy electric motor , trains run out power . but i'm amazed how long they last one charge . red fire rescue electric train extremely popular somewhat rare , which why amazon always sold out . you watch all time , but you find it . most geotrax elements very popular hard find , so you little homework . amazon best place find them , however , we've purchased least half dozen pieces them . overall , people who complain geotrax either rare lemon , or they never used product . this exceptionally well-designed , well-manufactured product any child love . you love it because it last years	1

my 8yo dd got this her grandma . she wanted it so bad . she loved it when she got , it so soft squishy , so cute . she used it first few mornings , but says she doesn't want use it anymore because it scares her when it barks . i'm sure this just personality quirk . we've tried putting it different places room so it not loud , which it not really loud anyway , but doesn't make difference . we also time setting alarm properly . there two on/off switches dogs legs don't seem go into right position every time it set , so i never know sure alarm go off . this our experience	1

now my son 5 , i look around good remote control car him , but i want it cheap one starters . this tyco thing perfect my purpose . it 3 rubber wheels no body , so it flip around doesn't matter - one side good ! it runs rather fast , but it isn't noisy so it doesn't drive me crazy . it turns perfectly , you get it flip , it flips if you run it against wall , so there no fear damage . five year old driver , dream come true ! remote transmitters takes one 9v , charger takes four aa batteries . my son plug car into charger 2 minutes , then he run it 10 minutes . it too bad they don't pictures here , but you envision it just engine 3 fat wheels . it little but it feels solid . my husband wrinkled his nose when i bought it ( " our kids get too many toys ! " ) , but once my son running it , he asked play it little , he won't let go until i forced him give it back ! even then , it big struggle get him give up control !

since description this not give you good grasp exactly how book set up i first fill you . first couple pages maze game , which quite frankly i see no purpose really not interesting my child ... might work other kids though . following 26 letters alphabet capital lower case tracers each game area bottom page . last few pages game pages simple three letter word tracers . okay onto review ... we got my son leappad plus writing christmas last year ( he 3-years-old , now 4 ) . well needless say he become very bored pre-k books available so i got this one . he doing tracer pages learning how write his name little while now i thought this would reinforce him wanting learn how write other letters not his name . much my surprise he not even remotely interested doing tracer area pages , however , games bottom pages really hold his interest quite well . while he not yet really learning how write different letters little games bottom teaching him how spell simple words . this very exciting my son he finally starting understand abc more purpose than just song ! while he not really interested tracing whole page a or any other letter he gladly traces simple three letter words bottom pages associated games , thus still teaching him how write some letters . result this he learned spell cat , cow , mop , dog , gum which he verbally now without word spelled out front him . game mode simple understand directions fairly straightforward . occasionally , he runs across word he doesn't understand because it hasn't taught him yet , like buzzard , but his curiosity it provides great reason teach word . overall i give this 5 stars ... even though it didn't get him excited learning write his letters .	1
went searching perfect play house type toy our 3 yr old daughter ... thought i going get dora talking house but came across fisher price sweet streets ... you simply can't compare 2 . true , dora house may help teach spanish but all it house , figurines , couch ... other accessories expensive not easy find . this entire collection sweet streets however unbelievable ! it bright , good quality that typical fp toys , hours play imagination endless . i'm sure i can't explain it well enough it justice ... there entire ' community ' ( village , city , country ) ... all sold separately very reasonably priced . check out entire collection sweet streets -- it looks so fun i can't wait xmas play it , too ! some pieces lights sounds : dinner movie ; country store ; carousel -- all well , very realistic . i can't imagine she get bored playing this because there such huge variety plenty pieces/components add it over time	1
we bought this toy christmas gift our almost 3 year old he loves it ! even our 11 month old likes it ( he uses it help him walk ) . i think it fairly sturdy toy , but i could see how it may not last long children rough it . my son already ripped some cardboard food boxes because he check if there actually food them . so those may not last long cart . but overall , i think it pretty good toy price	1

could've gone two thumbs up due voice not cullen . other than , i love this toy . i agree little pricey tag but it all depends upon if you really want it if you really afford it . if you true hardcore tf fan like i am , then price should not factor you ( you'll find way get one ) . if not , then look cheaper alternatives	1
$65 , display base , its pretty obvious optimus not meant used child toy . its 20th anniversary optimus , its very clearly aimed those us who watched big guy battle evils decepticons original airing , really , those conditions this piece should judged . starters , detail this guy insane . individually jointed fingers ( optimus * almost * flip you off he so flexible , just fingers curved enough they don't really stand out their own ) , vents his legs open , his mouthpiece moves via button back make it look like he talking , its just amazing . right down posable toes . thats not even getting into things like commlinks his arms ( one features grimlock flip up screen , other megatron)while it true his grip his blaster less than perfect , i re-iterate optimus here meant posed put display , he wasn't meant hold onto his gun while 8 year old whips him around . all articulation posability he robot mode , fact he actually transforms just icing cake . i would still given this thing 4 out 5 stars , even if he didn't transform , he good . while his truck mode isn't nearly sexy his robot mode , i say it again , he meant posed put display , why world would you want pose him truck ? optimus prime currently standing tall my desk work , watching over my paperwork , i couldn't happier . quote this very piece , " autobots , transform roll out !	1
my kids wanting these toothbrushes since they saw commercials it . i thought it great idea . now matter how hard i try unless i stand right next my children every time they brush , they don't brush long enough . since they like most songs available these brushes , i thought this would work . well it work , i bought them today my four year old keeps picking his up brushing . he doesn't seem mind sound , but it horrible . i thought maybe it just needed new battery but battery not replacable . i not make this purchase again .	-1

this game alot fun great wide range ages . i played this 3 year olds , 9 year olds adults . younger set i set it up them help them way . they trouble putting sticks back . older kids play it well their own . i haven't it long so i can't say much durability , but we haven't broken anything yet ! sticks seem flimsy but i think their flexibility helps getting them put into holes . younger kids like playing ' whoever gets most marbels wins ' version . they like hearing sounds seeing lights come when marbles come down chute . they haven't gotten into strategy side it , but still fun . game super easy put away ( which big plus daycare setting ) . just make sure smaller kids supervised safety reasons ( they could choke or turn pieces into weapons )	1
this game ended up trash bin--it made cheap plastic , falls apart easily , it difficult get all sticks , nobody wants put sticks back because that very boring . i think my memory failed me -- i thought this used fun game when my kids little -- i sure don't remember all hassles it . but i've noticed quality games/toys nowadays very poor -- so many cheezy , cheapo parts . save your money buy something else	-1

we purchased over years both brio wooden thomas sets now take sets . i must admit , my husband i differ opinion them . i always leaned toward brio he take . i say , price brio sets steadily climbing over years i just can't/won't justify added expense ( it big difference way ) brio sets when my boys ( 4 18 months ) love take alongs every bit much expensive ones ! my son loves take roundhouse i love there place all trains . i also think some negative reviews bit unfair . we've saved bundle these sets my kids love them . thats good enough me	1

i don't know quite what think game . i guess i just expecting something better than what we ended up . cons1 . while game comes rules , there lot gray areas make things confusing . other hand , you opportunity " fill gaps " yourself . what we keep track decisions we made regarding what we when we hit gray areas . 2 . workmanship game leaves something desired . when we first tried card dispenser , it would dispense cards ok , but would not latch properly when you turned key . i ended up taking dispenser apart ( caution , there spring inside you need watch out ) cutting notch slightly deeper help make it latch when you turn key . it now works perfectly . reading other reviews , there apparently general quality-control issue regarding dispenser . 3 . when you spin spinner , it often hard tell which number showing you make up rule what when spinner ends up two numbers . pros1 . kids like play game . i would say it especially enjoyable those under age 10.2 . turning key pressing " go " fun way dispense cards . 3 . i really like way you ask other players help you out mutually bad situations . when you ask assistance , either you or player may sacrifice better board position good all players . you don't find this kind thinking often enough games . 4 . although this game not really match game movie , it probably good you going get money . if i it all over again , i would buy game . however , i would lower my expectations	-1

my kids love ben-10 so it natural they would want whole she-bang during holidays ( rv characters watch ) . this cool action figure which comes its ship . it also convert into squirt gun which makes double fun ( unless their siblings don't want squirted course ) . it also makes it nice toy tub well . it pretty well made given price size larger than many smaller action figures because addition ship .	1
i say redone starscream pleasure buy . f-15 fighter looks real robot mode extremely poseable . only issues i it windscreen seen when robot mode it irritates me . second fact you cannot move arms full horizontal position since wings way . nose landing gear canopy open would nice too . but , overall very nicely . wait until you able get your hands ramjet ! he even better looking . he few issues himself , especially beginning wings leading edge restricting full downward position arms no nose landing gear or opening canopy , but i like this one better than starscream	1
i love my transformer but i'm 5 1/2 i still need some help grown up change it up . missiles broke off very first day	1
i say this updated version starscream quite nice . this starscream tall g1 version but his wings smaller . jet fighter mode more realistic looking than old starscream . i also like how robot mode looks more like cartoon character unlike g1 starscream . this starsceam definitely nice but there two things i not like it . first thing bothers me this starcream cheap plastic it made . plastic very flimsy when you try transform starscream . next thing i not like this starscream how null ray cannons not actually point straight out because back wings way . overall though this very nice looking collectors item . i wouldn't really call it toy because its questionable durability . i highly recommend not transforming this starscream too much because you may end up breaking those wing rudders his legs . if you want one these starscream get them while prices still reasonable . starscream hot seller alreadly hard find . don't wait this starscream if you want him . i already see people trying sell this starscream $30.00 dollars over msrp .	1

this toy given my kids santa last christmas ( 2003 ) if you read above review you notice reviewer just looking dimensions - i don't think actually purchased toy . this thing rocks ! quality unsurpassed . my kids ( all three ages 2-7 ) hours fun play this washing machine . it fixture when they play house their dolls . it never leaks water - i leary when santa brought it . they graduated playing it carpet . i set up clothes line nice days outside they play ' laundry ' some clothes pins their doll clothes . it always favorite when we friends over . after year i not replaced batteries it hours hours use . there fill level side so you don't put too much water . kids see their doll clothes ( or socks or rubber balls or anything else they think put it ) spin during wash spin cycle . there 4 cycles : water , where water get clothes slightly damp , wash , where water sloshed around clothes , water out- yep you guessed it it drains , spin - where it spins heck out clothes . i worried how water ' drains ' but it just goes back into resevoir - when you playing we empty it out via hose back machine into sink . it small but perfect your child play house . it 12 inches high 10 inches deep . price little steep but amount play time you get out it - it well worth it . if you happen across dishwasher matches this set - i not recommend . not much action you get this one . this great toy - buy it confidence it become favorite .	1
i bought this my nephew first christmas , it favorite toy ! this wonderful toy - simple sweet , but most amazing feature ! when animal dropped through top tent , it makes it sound - lion roars , monkey chatters , etc . when animal taken out through front door tent , tent says it name , such ' lion ' or ' monkey ' . tent very sturdy animals soft just right size little hands . highly recommended	1

star wars trivial pursuit saga edition ( 2005 . ) introduction :d espite around since middle seventies , star wars series never declined its popularity . george lucas created science fiction phenomenon stood test time , then some . needless say , many games based series - video games , role-playing games , no shortage board games adapted star wars universe . 1998 , star wars trivial pursuit released . die-hard fan series , it far my favorite ( non video game ) star wars game ever . unfortunately , it outdated fast , due fact it didn't cover prequel trilogy it immediately followed . but 2005 , seven years three star wars episodes later , new version game hit store shelves ! read my review new version star wars trivial pursuit . overview : quite honestly , who doesn't know what trivial pursuit ? well , those you who living under rock all your life , here concept behind game . players alternate rolling die moving their game token across wheel-shaped board . there six different-colored spaces . each color represents different category . player then asked question category . if he or she gets it right , he or she goes again . if he or she misses it , it next player turn . six spots board wedge spaces . objective game gain wedge all six colors return central hub wheel , answer game-winning question . some changes this edition game , rather obviously , questions overall game design star wars based , two dvds , which contain wedge game-winning questions . new concept game includes player able " steal " if player unable answer wedge question , last few seconds time . essentially , game play stays play classic stylings trivial pursuit , but gives it star wars overhaul . other words , this game exactly what it says it . review : original star wars trivial pursuit , without question , my favorite star wars game all time wasn't video game . this new version massive improvement over old version . starters , new version covers entire star wars film saga . classic galactic civil war trilogy ( episodes iv , vi ) prequel clone wars trilogy ( episodes i , ii , iii ) all get equal emphasis . if you hated original version not covering prequel trilogy , problem , obviously , corrected , major way . dvds also add nice new twist game . it good finally method setting wedge questions apart regular questions . , course , you anywhere two four players or teams . i few minor complaints , though . first all selection tokens characters you play . original version luke skywalker , princess leia , han solo , darth vader . other words , nice assortment main characters . new version luke skywalker , darth vader , obi-wan kenobi , yoda . other words , only jedi characters . this strictly cosmetic flaw , but still , i think they could picked better assortment characters than those four . complaint inclusion die . those you who never played original version game , it included electronic r2d2 figurine which would tell you how many spaces move when you tapped its head , via lcd screen . i liked better than rolling die because it helped give game unique star wars feel playing die just doesn't . problem price game - i've seen it everywhere $45 $60 ! even lowest msrp , it still rip off . one biggest problems one most obvious - if you're not die-hard star wars fan , you not get very far this game . my last biggest complaint questions themselves - like original game , they horribly imbalanced . some questions so simple , casual fan could answer them easily . some so difficult , even die-hards trouble them . this brings me my complaint dvd questions . not only these questions really no more difficult than card questions , but time ticks down , questions become easier ! this makes it ridiculously easy player " steal " wedge if question receiver unable answer . if i designing game , i'd straighten up these flaws . but i'm not , overall , i am very satisfied it . edition notes : this game fairly recent release , it remains readily available most major stores sell board-style games movie merchandise . if you want game , it shouldn't too hard - just ready pay fairly high price it . overall :d espite some minor issues , this new version star wars trivial pursuit leaps-and-bounds improvement over original game . if you're huge fan series who thinks your knowledge series supreme , don't hesitate buy this game . there many star wars trivia games/books/etc . over years , but star wars trivial pursuit ultimate star wars trivia experience . no fan should pass this game up	1

my 23 month old daughter loves chunky puzzles melissa doug . they so much easier grip manipulate into place than other wooden puzzles little peg knobs . we all chunky puzzles my daughter never tires them	1
i bought this toy my 6 month old because she loves bright colors musical things . i diappointed because it bored her moment i placed it her hands . she unimpressed pop up head , music shape . it too large her manipulate though it very durable ( nothing broke it yet she plays tough ) i don't think it worth money don't recommend it	1
everyone shower loved this gift . it too cute baby boy	1

i absolutely love my little pony petal parlor . it hasn't fallen apart me even once . ponies come it really cute . i no problem braiding their hair this toy . braids come out quite well barely any tangling . i don't know what people fussing . my opinion , you're just not careful , reading instructions properly , or rushing get it together . i'd say you're even breaking deliberately claiming it not durable . same goes other playsets . my advice you , quit whining complaining . just enjoy ponies if you don't like toy	1

my 10 month old twins love this hand puppet - they endlessly entertained fake-growling oscar impression . convenient hand puppet makes it really easy take mealtimes travel . some reason , they respond more oscar than cookie monster - perhaps it because his eyebrows ! anyhow , this high-quality puppet only thing i think lacking mouthpiece little hard move same time arms .	1
my son received this birthday present . after one use we put garbage . it simply not work shown . even after adding water paint directions state , spinner would not spin once paint poured into funnel . we tried adding even more water it still not work . once paint gets bottom tube , it slows motor point it barely spins . paint just runs out bottom pile ( if any even comes out) ! save your money !!	-1
just previous review states : i bought this toy my daughter , age 3.5 . age , kids supposed love paint or anything it . well , after trying half hour make it work her 90+ degree heat florida , she asked go inside . ( should your first clue)it wasn't any fun all , here why : 1 ) paint very thick . i thought it might just sitting inside cold air conditioning . but after outside ( 90+ degree heat ) , paint didn't thin out all , when we turned machine , hardly any paint came out . i * expecting * spin art sidewalk . we got some little paint splatters , but nothing like shown commercials . i called toys us i bought it they agreed take it back : used destroyed box ..	-1

my mom got this dino my 22 month old son christmas . he loves it ! it taller than my son so cute . it poseable enough able stand up , but same time quite soft . my son loves wrestle it drag it around house . you don't often find high quality stuffed toys this large such reasonable price , i'd say it great buy any kid who likes dinosaurs	1
i really like this toy because hamster really moves ! it better than kitty moves because you don't hook it up any thing up it . i only one problem it . wheel does'nt work me most time . hamtser usually falls out wheel 10 seconds after i put it ! but other than , it wonderful toy . i lot stuff lps .	1
my family loves this game - even though rated ages 10 up , my eight year old no problem playing ( we skip subjects like " dna " ) . there really no artistic skill needed - even plays better when few us aren't very good . we've played little four people modified it many ten - every time so much fun sometimes makes you laugh until you cry !	1

i'm afraid previous reviewer misses point maze . it designed allow user shift walls they progress through maze ; it not intended static maze if paper . there 16 starting configurations listed back product , they increase difficulty they progress . early settings require either no or very limited manipulation walls complete . you go more advanced settings , however , you encounter ever-more-complicated mazes require you plan ahead determine whether moving given wall help you or hurt you long run . this great toy teach strategic thinking , suitable variety ages ( some more advanced maze configurations quite challenging )	1
simply , big tex pistol ( likely any pistol or rifle made this company ) awesome ! 40 something who grew up westerns , i recently introduced my nine six year olds several old western classics ( they love butch cassidy sundance kid ) based their positive response , i set out find some quality western toys them play . sadly , western genre no longer cultural currency finding any cowboy related toy , book , or other frustrating there little select . i found big tex ( parris ) amazon search pleasantly surprised . these guns remind me quality you would expect product made 1950's/60 . it heavy duty very well made nice heft action . fit finish flawless very accurately detailed . plastic wood grip looks like wood . antiquing metal perfect , too . gun release lever open barrel allowing 12 round cap cylinder removed pretend reload or use related 12 round caps ( which also worked perfectly ) . action gun very sound . your children fire this over over no fear internal parts coming uncoiled or breaking . $13 , this toy great , great value . only issue i trying track down quality gun belt match guns . lastly , this clearly polarizing discussion point ( probably illegal ) , i must confess i'm not fan orange barrel end caps . they ok star wars gun , but i didn't grow up them my cowboy guns i feel they ruin look gun such , i prefer remove them ( again , cowboy guns only ) . orange end cap these guns very well attached ( again - great quality ) . should you inclined remove them , i suggest screwing sheetrock screw directly into center cap create small opening . then , well ventilated area , use bbq grill lighter hold open flame orange cap flame directed small opening . plastic smoke begin melt away , after couple minutes , render small opening center cap soft enough insert flathead screwdriver so you easily pry cap housing barrel end . you may whittle way inside bit , reheat repeat this process couple times until core housing comes out . there good smudge black soot barrel , but it rubs off completely zero discoloration or damage antiqued finish . if you looking classic , good ole cowboy gun your kids reminds you toy you would grown up - - this one buy .	1
my six-year-old got this her easter basket . she loves all kinds art so we thought this would something fun different her . not so . first page worked she loved it , but markers started dry out very quickly . time she got second page , markers no longer worked well enough dissolve black coating . my daughter colored over same area 100 times still got only faintest bit neon show through . she very frustrated heartbroken her easter present such dud . i'd expect quality like this roseart , but not crayola . what complete waste money time	-1
this cool t-rex moves roars just like real dinosaur . my seven-year-old son received one christmas , he really likes it . eyes glow , neck head move , mouth opens . it built strong hours fun , imaginative play . best all , there no assembly required . i highly recommend this great dinosaur . any child who interested dinosaurs definitely like this great life-like t-rex	1

this house so much fun ! it went together rather quickly ; i put it together myself under 20 minutes . best part this house me it fun me add while my daughter plays it . what i mean add this : only thing i really disliked house ( this minor nitpick ) door handle . it bright white just clashed house . i went home depot purchased ' santa fe style ' drawer pull it looks tons better . this all started lizard embossed side . it screamed color ! i painted it artist acylic paint it looks nice . then i started paint cactus pots . then i added knob inside . then i started paint stone siding . next i am going add hanging plants like they picture . picture i added doesn't much painting ( i took it early project ) but when i am i'll take more pictures . bit excessive ? perhaps ! nevertheless , we both enjoyed house personalizing it one kind . acrylic paint not come off weather nor jet-waterhose . before you go painting it , try it hidden place . i would hate you ruin your playhouse my advice ! fyi , i used liquitex artist paint not thinner crafty stuff comes bottle . short , proceed your own risk , but know there tons ( non-permanet ! ) ways you customize this house . add house numbers side . put name plate up . fun it ! last thing i say this : if price seems bit much look up used ones online - they almost sell same price new one ! so , when time comes you want part it , you'll more than likely get good price it	1

i'll preface this review saying i actually like this toy . i really like shuttle mode robot mode design pretty cool . said , it its issues . train mode just plain weird . it looks like somebody took bullet train stuck extra chunk boxiness it . i don't mind fact he now bullet train instead old-school smokestack model ( it not like those kinds trains even exist anymore ) , i just think actual train design slightly off . arms robot mode also bit problem . cockpit train covers his hands forearms bit too much . i think look his robot mode awesome , but forearms could much better only little bit work . however , he triple changer he cheap , so if you don't let these things bother you too much , it nice purchase	1
this action figure really fantastic , mixture silver black makes batman look totally awsome intimidateing . he five points articulation not break unless you really put some force into it . only problem this toy body poportion ( his legs look pathetic compared his overly musclular upper body ) way main frame like all other jl figures other than these minor flaws this figure please any batman lover	1

my 5 year old daughter received this toy her birthday . unlike others , we not trouble dolphins . perhaps this because my daughter often takes them off herself play them seperately . this toy seems much sturdier than barbie carriages pulled horses , where horses often fall over or become unattached too easily . all all , it seems well made me	1

i think sea monkeys great pets . i really enjoy watching them toodle around their care-free manor it very relaxing . tank fun watch them it neat looking back ground . read instrucions thoroughly several times it could cause health crisis if you not sure only feed once week . not over feed it caused resent death all my sea monkeys . you need arorate tank dayly , aqua leash adiquit put it water push not suck inward it inafective way . repeat several times . all all , i basicly told you every thing there . aditional info . go www.sea monkeys.com, click third icon " taking care pet sea monkeys " this answer any aditional info .	1
this great supplement our play kitchen . there lot pieces this set , which 3 or 4 big gadgets like mixers , food processors , blenders , etc . those items battery powered . i haven't put battteries them they use it pure pretend play mode . my reasons liking this product : good variety items contained set , pieces durable ( they plastic , but hard , smooth plastic don't ' cheap ' look feel ) , toy getting lot play use , basic simple toy terms allowing kids pretend play without entertainment noise automation . addition , i still option put batteries enjoy toy level too .	1
i just love hearing these sounds . they so relaxing except horse . i am not one whinnying . it sounds like barnyard . i really like munching slurping sounds . they sound pretty . i just make those munching slurping sounds all day . if i lived foreign country could hire someone push those sounds inexpensive wage i might it . i really don't think would cruel job like sweatshop , i mean all you would make those noises pushing toys . don't report me amnesty international or anything !!! so basically if you like slurping or munching noises you going get addicted this farm set . get it !	1

my daughter got this her 1st birthday , now seven months later , it still one her favorite toys ! she loves all action , play cymbal , little drum pad , tambourine ... my only negative comments it little bulky storage , takes up lots room toy box . i say i like nice mix music , slightly different usually childrens toy music , not nearly annoying !	1

it fun find unusual prereader games , since we four-year-old " cat person " home , this perfect . directions easy , even humorous ( person shortest pinky goes first ) . game fast-paced ends time suits attention span . cat dish little flimsy side , but easily enough replaced any old bowl home if it splits . we think purple wooden mice scream . this perfect after-dinner game play when you just want short game doesn't get everyone too wound up before getting ready bed	1
we bought this game play our sons ( ages 3 5 ) they love it ! it easy learn , quick play , lot fun . unlike some kid games out there , it not mind numblingly dumb or boring . our boys love able roll dice each time -- believe it or not , this one two games we own where there no tantrums over who won who lost . they just ask play again , again , again ! it even good kids who aren't counting very high , both kids engaged while we play . there probably more educational games around , but this one just plain fun . :) quick ' how ' this game : roll two dice . sleeping kitty - nothingarrow - pass one your mice person your leftmouse - take mouse bowlfood bowl - feed kitty one your miceso if you roll arrow food bowl , you pass one mouse left put one bowl . last person mice left wins . very simple play i said up above , it quick moving game -- no time get bored	1
i've only used traders builders inns cathedrals expansions , but i've also carcassone city carcassone without expansions . four variations i've played , carcassone traders builders definitely most interesting . variations game already described well other reviewers , so i'll limit my comments what makes expansion so interesting : -the trade goods give players incentive complete other players ' cities ; other versions game , players often avoid other players cities because they don't want expand city ( adding city value ) close city ( causing city scored ) . -in addition ot fun twist , builder also great way speading up game . i think it actually took us less time play this expansion despite learning new rules adding tiles . if you own carcassone , you should own this expansion	1
we given this game gift so addicted we purchased board game version which even more fun ( but better 3+ players ) . anyone who visits our house gets hooked well . card game good 2 players makes good gift $15-20 , board game more like $30-40 . we also invested some expansion sets computer version . don't let rules bog you down begining , you enjoy this game	1
i just went bought expansion card set ( five new themes ! ) am looking forward adding these cards into basic game . kid local game store told me board game , but i looking two-person game i could take vacation me my fiance paris . it very compact game pack , but don't try play it plane space required set up cards . bed , floor , or table perfect . anyhow , this game lot fun allows various defensive offensive strategies tested ( i.e. build knight strength /or commercial enterprise , build towns cities , use spies or libraries etc . ) , includes some luck , good memory . each game i've played pretty close , so it retains its value over time . it takes up least two or so hours , but time limit adjusted limiting victory point total . all all , great alternative way spend evening home , or abroad late into night your significant other hiding out nasty ( dollar-euro ) exchange rates	1
our three year old loves her desk chair . they very sturdy seem well built . they came right out box , almost no assembly required . finish construction really nice she seems very comfortable drawing playing . overall very pleased	1

frog juice great ! it fun play great if you're working addition . if your worrying it " little kiddies " it won't . my sister ( 15 ) her friends love this game . it slightly hard understand first time you play catching not too hard . one my favorite aspects game illustrations playing cards they're great . imaginative illustrations absolutely fantastic . overall i would highly recommend this game	1
this great game play any event i first learned it my softball summer camp . we played every night it very very fun . its easy play u play hour	1
i sad discover this not nearly fun its brother mattel football handheld . play modes not well-defined : level one too slow level two too fast even after hours play . buttons much less durable feeling than one would expect casing . kitch value makes it cool your coffee table , but most people pick it up , play it once or twice , say same thing " where football one like this ?	-1
this puzzle perfect my 7 year old attracted interests my 5 3 year old . every homeschooler should look into purchasing this puzzle enhance geography lessons .	1
i tried order this last christmas but it sold so well it out stock ! great price amp ; great buy , i signed up waiting list amp ; finally got it couple days ago . its really hard find good map us amp ; good price . this covers every state , major cities marked amp ; capitols marked . i looked other maps store but never bought one because it didnt things i looking . plus they very expensive . this help our child learning where all states amp ; know capitols . we all learn them school amp ; this fun way it . also way rest family brush up this information	1
we got this christmas present played it once , kids i bored it . us , it wasn't really much challenge game ended way too quickly . also , game not look like it could stand rough play , which i think definitely happen this game . honestly , playing " go fish " regular playing cards more fun than this game	-1

we recently purchased this game my 4 year old son after visit smithsonian see dinosaur exhibit . he absolutely loves this game ! we've playing it almost every night since he got it ( 2 months now ) . it fun game . my husband i even enjoy playing it	1
my 7 year old got this his 6th birthday both he his 5 year old brother really enjoy this game . we suggested rules roll dice twice speed game up when our youngest playing . my children discovered often times dinosaur who appears weakest actually wins , so there no fighting over who gets what dinosaur . those families who prefer board games reading over tv , this game you . yes , it requires longer attention span than most games , but so average school classroom . cheers game doesn't " talk down " kids !!	1
my family use this game weekends instead watching tv , great fun family get togethe	1
my daughter just got this doll her 3rd birthday . we tried two sets batteries it never swam . she enjoys playing it anyway . but top pain put back . i hope my friend not spend lot money this gift . i not recommend buying it	-1
very difficult assemble keep assembled . only purchase it if you intend leave it original box collectible . not worth money play toy due poor qualit	-1
i love this game !! you collect cool bean cards into gardens then harvest them gold coins . best thing this game very cooperative . you trade people because you not allowed change order you hand you plant top , it takes some strategy sometimes really nice get ahead ! i recommend highly all older players ( i am 30 ) well younger	1
how anyone not like this game ? how anyone not interested learning german name soybeans ? how anyone not want get know deeper bean trading skills your friends ? this game fun , easy explain , easy learn . when i teach it people , we usually not need trial round . it intuitive , there bean planter all us . i taiwaneese , south african , indian , hongkong , australian friend who all asked me get this game germany . shame amazon doesn't it moment !!	1
this game , three-color code , using zoo animals , great kids . ( regular mastermind four colors ) . everyone my four year old ten year old their friends love playing it . it great teaching logical deduction . even if some pieces get lost , long you don't lose too many you still play game . highly recommended , " rush hour kids , " which builds same skills	1
grandma showed him how work buttons 7 months he 9 months old now . he doesn't really understand how it works still . he hits it , drops it when music comes out he bobs his head . he likes it very much . i often turn it him . i think australian kids who sing many songs get lyrics occasionally wrong like ; " now i know my abcs tell me what you think me " instead " next time won't you sing me . " oh well he won't ever know difference . it helps me sing him . tunes short jog my memory so i sing all sorts tunes i wouldn't otherwise sing without prompting . this creates more daddy time . great toy . most his stuff he suck he hasn't used this teethe . i would take it away him i think because our boy so wet this holes it speaker . maybe not we musical rattles too	1
this version sasquach alpha flight comics . it great figure . sasquach also appears exiles comic series , age apocalypse sabretooth ( who convieniantly appear ml sxvi ) . this great figure well scale , abotu twice size astonishing x-men wolverine . cardbacks list wolverine 5'3 " , sasquach 10 ' . i both regular variant sasquach ( which technically snowbird sasquach form ) . both look amazing , well sculpted , though variant slightly more interesting paint ops , white base , blue black really bring out highlights lowlights . it great see two sasquaches pitted against one . it would nice see issue alpha flight which sasquach , snowbird sasquach squared off , since it would able show both figure variant origin quite nicely . but i've noticed comic reprints chosen more often than not their covers , which usually feature character they're packed quite prominately . whether or not character very much actual story line . sasquach seems pretty easy comr , however , finding variant may little harder . both worth adding your collection . don't let fact this more obscure character stop you picking one up , not just apocalypse piece either . i first saw character listed this series , puzzled , thinking i might not even get one , but after picking it up , very pleasantly supprised . here hoping some other alpha flight members get ml treatment , such vindicator , guardian , snowbird ; some exiles ( nocturne ! ) too	1
get cool figure build your own 14 " massive apocalypse figure which looks awesome might well sculpture . articulated sculpture ! sasquach comes massively muscled arm apocalypse arm tube . tube goes apocalypse waist his elbow looks cool but i guess it transports elbow grease or something . sasquach comes one more detailed sculpts but his color scheme little less exciting he mostly brown ( or white if you get variant ) . however , this huge guy who towers over other regular figures sculpt articulation excellent . some articulation even hidden scuplt ( such cut wrists ankles ) which always cool . very fun he always looks ready beat crud out someone . very solid buy even if you don't want whole apacalypse , which would nuts , but still .	1
my 5 year old 3 year old always fighting over swing swing set . when i bought this hung it tree . my 5 year old loved idea " swinging tree " i feel safe her it . just make sure branch strong enough take weight motion swing	1

my son got bunch books/cartridges little touch leapad christmas . it hard keep track all it , so when i saw this bag i immediately bought it . everything fits perfectly inside it great travel !! it keep cartridges more secure i put them sandwich bag before pocket , other than i just use it . this great accessory little touch leappad	1
concept good , however it just not functional . game system itself barely fits inside . there 2 small pockets storeage game books cartridges ... which if you more than two barely fit . it not organize well i am afraid cartridges fall out some point . this product not worth $20 we paid it	-1
my son extensive thomas collection his little sister always " messing things up " . it his idea buy this her christmas . now when she goes into his room mess up his track , he gets out lady , builds her simple circle track lets her play her own train next him . it worked like charm .... no more " mom , she tearing up my tracks "	1
i really dont know how whole soap opera saga going ken barbie since i played them last myself 30 years ago or so , but i bought this guy blaine my 3 1/2 year old substitute " julian " princess pauper-i bought both girls christmas each anneilese erika doll also purchased wedding clothes ken queen princess . my 5 year old given ken swan lake ( blonde)last year her birthday-he resembled julian both my girls previously ken " king dominic " but my little one not " julian " swan lake blonde ken no longer available , so i got her blaine . he worked out just fine except fact this guy expressionless-no smile or smirk blaine ??? least ken smile his face-looks like blaine sullen expression he ate too many those power bars he supplied box . my daughter asked why her " julian " (blaine ) not look like her sisters " julian " ???? i told her , " julian tutoring anneilese all day courtyard very sunny day forgot his sunscreen . " it didn't fool her-but she just fine blaine .	1
it true barbie ken never married , but those correcting others here barbie relationship kelly need open their eyes . we so gullible we're going believe barbie kelly her sister ? barbie dates era where it not uncommon unwed pregnant girl shipped " stay her aunt " year , then after her return she would conveniently gain " baby sister " . marlon brando went most his life call his grandmother " mom " his mother " sis " ; google it details . images text accompanying set barbie pushing kelly stroller makes it clear what their true relationship	1
i purchased this item when it sale $20 . after using it few days , here my first impressions . good : it already comes batteries both remote ( 9v alkaline ) car ( rechargeable charger ) . it also adjustable wheel alignment make sure it goes straight when you want go straight . tires work well carpet should work well concrete/asphalt ( haven't taken it outside yet ) bad : charge time vs . play time horrible . average charge time 4-5 hours ! usable run time anywhere 30-45 minutes tops . also , battery uses older ni-cd cells . todays battery technology i would liked see ni-mh or li-ion battery optional quick charger . tires very hard . this translates really bad traction control tile or hardwood floors . r/c also poor torque . without getting it up speed , this r/c trouble pushing small stuff animals out way over small bumps or obsticles . i my doubts actual " off-road " usability . jeep rubicon ford 350 also available which i imagine same parts underneath just different body " shells " . overall , it still fun item $20 . price tag . i wouldn't spend more than	1
i few reservations it , some game mechanics overly complicated .... which some people may seem like oportunity extra strategy , but same time it means picking up this game somewhat pain because some thing non intuitive . it true there no 1 non winning strategy it better more players . however i prefer san juan ( which same company , * very * similar . i view san juan cleaned up version puerto rico , it may * slightly * less complex game , but doing accounting stuff alot easier it less poinless fiddly bits , which i feel results more fun game	1
puerto rico kind game gets people hooked start . if you hardcore gameboard player , buy it . you not regret it . way , somebody amazon tell me why you dont sell more games rio grande company	1
lost cities captivated my wife me -- we play almost every other day . game certainly deserves its accolades , including " best game couples , " real simple ( which how we discovered it ) . gameplay extremely straightforward ( imagine two player competitive solitaire) -- it only took 10 minutes us get going , we haven't stopped since . you become more experienced , game become very strategic , elements deception sabotage . it great after-dinner game , it'll feed your appetite puzzles , competition , entertainment	1
i'm wife guy who loves games . i'm more into console pc games , but rarely touch board/table top games . my husband other hand loves both equally . we decided try spend more quality time together , trying out different things we each like decided compromise . i would play table-games more often if we could play them some time coffee shop ( he hates coffee ! hehe ) he got this game , i addicted immediately ! it easy learn , quick play ( 20-40 mins game ) , fun exciting , we equally matched win ! ( i've beaten him quite few times , thank you very much!)i've even taken this game out meet some girlfriends gotten them hooked it , too . one friend even requests i bring it me just case we get chance play ! hurrah !! ( box small enough fit my purse , too ! haha)me my husband also really enjoy carcassonne : castle , if you care game suggestion . it also meets requirements easy learn , fun play , we're both evenly matched win . enjoy !	1
product good product but it unreliable . i bought it locally my daughter when i took it home it broken ... when letter placed machine machine would say different letter , thouroughly confusing little one . i returned it got one english ... this time it worked my daughter enjoyed it . i bought third one via amazon gift shipped overseas . when it arrived , i told it broken showing same symptoms one i originally bought ... $20 down drain ...	-1
i don't like this game all . it boring , if you can't think answers while , then you want leave , which exactly what i why i'm writing this review . i can't stand it . concept so-so , but game isn't . it so slow , people i play never seem fun , they just finish find out if they'll win or not . boring ....	1
this game so much fun !! i love word play - games actually exercise your mind - this one excels it ! it great range ages .... young children learning vocabulary well older audience . ( it even fun social get togethers - cocktails help bring out some really outrageous word combinations ! ) dice good size graphics easily read . i highly recommend this game . friends i used get together play catch phrase parties - now we break out visualeyes ! it also nice because it so user friendly - so easy understand - not lot rules try remember . it just good fun !	1
we resisted buying these because they seemed so cheap ... also usual question we parents always ask ourselves ... " what they going them ? " our son received his first bionicle friend his ninth birthday ... it cleverly " bow " birthday present . i now regret overlooking this wonderful line " lego " so long ! my boys love these ! they best time building them even better time playing them . they priced reasonably so you always pick-up one treat during trips out " shopping " . if you encourage your children " save-up " some their " wants " , cost these low enough it doesn't take them months months realize their goal . please not make same mistake i made misjudge these toys . you denying your child great experience . although manufacturer suggests ages 7 up , i not feel child younger than 8 or 9 would able indendently put this toy together . my 7 year old needs some help putting these together , but he loves try all himself . point lego , construct play . primary benefit , my opinion , satisfaction " doing it " yourself ! definate a+ our boys ! rosemary	1
why ? why you keep using , same old colors ? why such high prices ? it much more than i get my allowance , pete sake ! good luck	1
if you read my reviews lego products , you see i repeated my self all them , because these people never fail amaze me new product lines . city line youngsters ( i bought it 7 y/o ) . he fun it , i think i won't trouble finding gift any coming occasions . people please believe me when i tell you , i played legos when i young , now my both boys playing their products too ... not buy building products other than lego	1
i friend young daughter who given bratz doll gift . her mom thought doll " inappropriate " dressed too racy . my friend asked me take look these dolls tell her what i thought . she asked me if she should take doll away her little girl . now i find myself , twenty something year old woman no kids , middle barbie vs bratz doll war . so i looked dolls both online stores omg they gorgeous ! i loved this one particular . cloe really pretty doll , i thought her highlighted hair awesome very realistic , looks kind like my hair fact ! i think bratz original , beautiful creative i no problem all way they dressed . this version cloe i found very non-offensive wondered how earth parent could find anything wrong here . she covered , not showing too much skin . girls wear stuff like this . big deal . i don't see what all fuss honestly . parents really this lame ? i don't think bratz any worse than barbie ( least bratz more realistic looking body ! ) fact i feel line focuses far more individuality creativity . bratz all races colors all different styles personalities not ' cookie cutter ' looking like barbie . these dolls hot i wish they made stuff like this when i kid . so i told my friend " lighten up , it only toy ! if she likes it let her keep it . " perhaps i would feel differently if i kids . apparently there lot parents who dislike these dolls but my opinion old fogies should get program ! this how women dress , many teenage pop stars young celebrities wear things like this tv it no big thing . women fashions seen lot change . 1950 girls would get trouble if skirt above their knees , now it no big deal . times change toys change . bratz modern interpretation dreams young girls today , just barbie represented what their mom grandmas wanted when they grew up . after checking out bratz ( cloe my fave ) clothing i new inspiration outfits next time i go out my bf ! all girls out there who love bratz : these dolls pretty , so play them fun don't mad if your parents don't let you dress like bratz . when you adult you wear whatever you want ! i loved glamour fashion little girl i always .	1
this one thing my 5 year old asked christmas -- it looked very cheap i didn't think it would work . i wrong --- it works very well . she needs help using it but it makes beautiful designs she finds all movement very entertaining ... i would get this birthday present 5-8 year old girl	1
my 3 year old daughter wanted this because she saw it tv . she played it day we brought it home hasn't asked it since . pens hard fit , foot stamps didn't really work well , either . we made big page drawings some newsprint paper then after pens ran dry because she forgot cap them , i no idea if replacements even sold . later day we just forgot him drawing toy just played him if he big plastic bug . now he back box . i wish i would saved my money bought drawing board or maybe nice spirograph . i always try avoid gimmicky toys like these but it seems i can't quite ever learn lesson	-1
holiday angel barbie doll best!it wings come come back . holiday angel very pretty ! i got her because i moved up level three platinum gymnastics	1
my daughter 2 years old when she got her videonow jr loved it . she soon able play discs herself . but she loved it too much soon out batteries . so i thought i could buy car adaptor it just like videonow my older daughter , but no . what i'm most frustrated . i bought second adapter no use it . so if you buy videonow jr prepared buy alot batteries	1
maybe it my imagination , but when i played pacman here , it seemed better than original pacman joystick . just seemed sharper joystick great response . i enjoyed playing pacman plus it edgier than regular pacman . eating " fruit " also causes ghost monsters go blue , but they vanish first few seconds making eating them all more challenging . sometimes random ghostmonster not turn blue when you eat energizer . short , it unpredictable makes replay value pretty high . pac-n-pal , bit more odd ball . when you energize you push button shoot beam ghostmonsters . plus there 5th ghostmonster " pal " who steals your fruit , but can't kill you . eat fruit before he carries it into center box . course , if you fan super pacman , this game rendition close you get . remember , tv screens not same aspect ratio or resolution arcade monitor , so try not gripe over graphics . game play there , what matters . i never got feeling this weak remake , but felt it better quality . some reason , my joystick only one button . very well worth money super pacman pacman plus , alone	1
wow , what great game ! i would highly recommend this game anyone looking new game try or those who already know love it . instructions contain some new variations which spice up game bit those us who played it years . it pretty easy learn full fun large groups ( we've played double decks larger groups)and only couple people . this new set comes great hard silver case , full new colors , cards good sturdy , hold up well use . i highly recommend this new 25th anniversary set	1
when i opened box , he so excited . he blast them	1
our son excited get this toy . only problem toy doesn't anything . it appears it made magnetic , so boulders stick construction equipment . however , this not case . boulders fall off trucks serve no purpose . would lot more fun if they could stick trucks	1
time this model came out , it largest set 3104 bricks . it took me several days ( 12 - 16 hours ) assemble it . model very impressive its size almost 1 meter ( 37 inches ) . even though meantime lego released death star ( model #10143 ) more 3449 bricks , this still biggest one ( size wise ) around . definitely must-have lego/star wars fans	1
if you thomas series wooden railway series , then all means , sure you get duck . he just one older trains , almost each every video . he doesn't usually large role , but he kind good friend all engines . this guy gets taken bed our house also , everywhere we go . it pretty funny listening all role playing going carseat this guy hey , he even dance wiggles ! these trains definitely develop imagination fine motor skills , but they also become friends . these wooden guys very durable too . they don't chip like you'd think they would when dropped onto floor . we plan keeping our wooden train series interconnecting them " real " train set when our little one gets older . also , don't forget check out ho series thomas here amazon . i didn't know they existed what neat way introduce your little one fascinating world trains . something they definitely grow up use quite some time . highly recommend duck	1

what great add settlers game , added all sorts new factors made it more challenging . cant wait share it our friend	1
we finally got around getting this , well , truth told , my wife got it off my wish list my birthday . we've played couple times starting get hang it . it bit more complicated longer play , there more things keep track probably lot different types ways win . i recommend getting this upgrade if you haven't tried it yet . if you're new catan games , you definitely want start off learning basic game first , before trying this out , but once you've played basic game few times , you'll want move several expansion packs try them ou t.t he best thing this game ( others series ) each game made different using few random factors , such moving resources around before starting also how you decide tackle position you end up when it comes deciding who goes first . using different expansion packs this basic game played thousands different ways depending how dice fall good player get challenged average player . this series comes strong recommendation .	1
this game addition game settlers catan . our family really enjoyed game settlers . we didn't think this game could improved upon . however , since we added addition , cities knights , we cannot go back just plain settlers catan . this game intrigue , planning , chance strategy all rolled into one game . even members our family don't often play games , love this game . we heartily recommend it teenagers adults . it really great game	1

my daughter received this puzzle gift when she 18 months old she quickly learned how puzzle correctly . she loved matching up animal puzzle pieces animals pictured puzzle slots . she also loves telling me which animals make which sounds . red plastic knobs little bit small her first , but i think just because she used large wood knobs her other wood puzzles . my main complaint this puzzle animals not painted puzzle -- instead they some sort laminated paper or something like . so when she would chew puzzle pieces ( teething babies apt !! ) she able very quickly make small pieces pictures disintegrate . i don't encourage her chew puzzle pieces , but she sometimes slip them into her mouth . anyhow , now all animals look little strange around edges -- wood intact , but pictures disintegrated bit . fun puzzle , but finish pieces definitely ought more appropriate young children . this puzzle isn't quite up high standards most melissa doug toys	1

while i am not crazy his gun mode , i absolutely love megatron robot mode . his head resembles g1 cartoon version megatron . some slight problems - megatron head seems pretty small compared his body . green color his " wings " seems off rest figure . also , lastly orange end his cannon even more off than green . purple right his coloring scheme galvatron . too bad takara didn't use this color purple reissue galvatron rather than light purple . overall this figure worth it if you want robot version megatron . his gun mode not so appealing , but robot mode rules	1

this ridiculous , you all praise multi-billion ( that right ) dollar corporation donates $ 100,000 susan komen breast cancer foundation when you clearly know this corporation capable donating millions . mattel corp like many other american corporations main concern generate great revenue before anything else . this task accomplished through publicity stunts like this , creating pink ribbon barbie few proceeds going susan komen breast cancer foundation created large publicity increase sales their products . turn , they've received more advertising than actually paid through this tactic . if wasn't enough , majority mattel products made third world nations such china where most if not all their resources obtained . estimated actual cost this particular barbie packaging around $2.50 ( pair nikes retail over $100 usd costs less than $3 make ) , given $2.50 donated every pink ribbon barbie produced sold total mattel corp donated sunsan komen breast cancer foundation total 40,000 pink ribbon barbie produced sold ( i honestly believe there more than 40k units produced personally ) . so math follows , doll sells $25.00 , mattel spends $2.50 each unit additional $2.50 donations , profit total mattel corp each pink ribbon barbie comes out $20 800% profit total cost . but lets more realistic , say there additional costs haven't calculated all , estimated calculation these additional costs mattel corp still brings home 700% profit per doll . mattel corp no way philanthropist .	-1

my son received this when he 16 months old loves it almost much i . first , he seemed disappointed when he'd squeeze legs no music would come out like when mommy played it , so he tried stepping legs , very pleased when worked . after more practice , he learned how squeeze legs his hands , now make music whenever he wants . this such great toy so many ways . he'll carry it handle top its head , it perfectly-sized so legs don't drag floor while he walks room room . handle also makes it easy get good grip , so he toss it around room . when it lands , it spin tentacles flying out , which amuses both us . when he laying his crib , he'll often just stare into big smiling eyes octopus . i wish it came little booklet many songs played octotunes . somewhat musical myself , i've able think many songs key played just 8 white notes middle high , but it might frustrating those without musical background figure out what songs play octotunes , how	1

hasbro it yet again . after success hard find darth tater earlier this year , they now given us equally elusive spud trooper . made up look like stormtrooper original star wars trilogy , this excellent addition star wars mr. potato head line . this looks great standing next darth tater someone said previously , i am now need second one go other side darth tater . i love how weapon potato masher . this very clever toy great conversation piece . i am glad i got one i because these seem disappeared rather quickly . so if you any interest picking one these up see it stock here or anywhere else buy it right away or you sorry . i no doubt this just popular hard find darth tater figures	1

we've number gazillion bubble machines . first - this one , upright rotating set bubble wands - worked relatively well , but stopped working after maybe dozen uses . ( granted , one those uses few hours ) . when level liquid low , machine stops making bubbles since it pick up enough liquid cover wand . we replaced it next year typhoon machine - this awesome , produced huge quantity bubbles worked more reliably since bubble liquid sucked up put wands , no matter how low supply liquid . it large reservoir bottom so you don't need fill it very often - it takes lot liquid though . our issue now getting liquid . gazillion liquid produce best bubbles - they last well , etc . etc . etc . however , very few stores stock liquid , except when i first bought first machine , o-o ne stocks large size bottles . even online vendors like toys.com who supposed them , never them stock ( i've their notify list long time ! ) i've ended up buying someone canada ebay - otherwise , buying smaller bottles toysrus , target , etc . just too expensive . both these machines don't really work if you try other bubble liquids - other liquids ( especially cheaper kinds very large size bottles ) much thinner liquid drips right off wands before it chance pass blower part make any bubbles . we're planning start making our own bubble liquid hopefully cover us . otherwise , machines useless now .	-1

i disagree other reviews . i think ' read me ' part system great ; however , games terrible . not because content , but because controls extremly slow respond . half time it not acknowledge correct answer , says it wrong , but we know we selecting correct answer . maybe it my dvd player , but i don't think so . i also wish stories could little bit longer , or perhaps they could put multiple stories disk . anyway system great reading stories children , but games lacking functionality .	1
i recently purchased this item my kids love it ! product involves several components different skill levels , i could see my kids playing long time . reading other reviews it looks like they might gotten defective items . we not encounter problem others spinners warping .	1
my daughter received this her 5th birthday . she some ballet experience so we thought she would pick up this rather quickly . only one portion dvd really instructional-and part fast fast fast ! i say fast ?! thank goodness rewind feature dvd -- this music redundant -- but that ok -- my daughter loves it . she so wants follow dancing but there little no actual step-by-step instruction . it basically several cute bubbly girls dancing away plastic numbered mat . upside -- she still loves her microphone headset singing . this product could easily improved adding chapters varying difficulty level so allow younger children catch . label say 5 years up	-1

moment , this starter set series , although they show even smaller dizzy set catalog but it not yet available . you get benny , fence , orange cone , window building piece . there isn't much build after putting benny together , but you can't expect much price . little benny front loader rear scoop , so your child should love playing him . other plus benny he small stout out all bob duplo characters , he withstands heavier play without his pieces popping off . one downside he only one ( although dizzy probably other if it ever released ) not able fit little bob character inside . all other sets come bob figure but this one	1

this must if you geotrax starter set . my son received basic tracktown railway 2 1/2 we immediately went out bought him elevation track packs . adults set layout up , its little bit trickier 3 dimensions , but elevation what makes geotrax way better than any other train set ! only drawback you can't just buy one elevation track pack . this one you need because it most ramps , but you buy one able anything once you get up top . i recommend flats set . we 1 each 3 elevation packs that enough connect all elevation accessories we ( clock tower , suspension bridge , mile high mountain ) . definitely add your geotrax , its worth it ! your child love it so you	1

we bought two these replace old , worn out swings play set we inherited when we bought our current house . this their second season they survived winter snows drastic fluctuations utah weather wonderfully . even protective plastic tubing over chain like new condition after out weather all year . we just purchased expensive , large wooden set i surprised find included swings aren't good quaility these . we're going hold onto these swings even when we get rid rest older set since they so well made . they also large enough fit my bum just fine . i'm not very big person , but i still impressed how comfortable they -- not pinching or tight through hip all . i sit out my kids swing without getting uncomfortable least . i think these every bit good , if not better than swings sell $60 more .	1
single player pack definitely not pointless . yes , it more expensive if you're getting multiple taggers , or even use more than just one . but , if you're kid who friends all ltto , you want one your own , $30 lot easier save up than $50 . you could say , " well , then get irt-2x . " would also fine , but irt-2x doesn't hud , can't even use one if you one go it , ' cus it doesn't hud port . hud appealing kids actually quite useful game . single player pack also good when someone uneven number members family or group doesn't want spend $20 just extra . i'm not saying it best deal or anything , just it not entirely pointless	1

i borrowed one these friend grand cayman last year - i loved it so much i came home bought 4 them different colors future vacations ! it doesn't tip over like inflatable loungers , it allows your body stay wet cool , while still keeping you above water . it easy pack too ! it very high quality , especially pool float - it should last you many years , even frequent use	1
i thought this would just ticket my 6 year old crafter . wrong ! i spent 15 minutes trying different angles , pressures , speeds , nothing helped . still popped out looking like i tore it out paper . stylus button must pushed hard long anything . must used under adult supervision point could very dangerous . it very fine metal point could just easily perforate skin . both my daughters tried it . six year old spent 10 minutes , me assisting her every other minute because she got so frustrated it trying get it work " right " . she no longer interested using it . my 14 year old tried it , same problems i . she no longer interested . i would give this item zero stars if i could . i doubt this item market very long	-1
maybe kids don't like it , but i assure you , i . i took it my stamping card making club show after christmas . they all wanted one after seeing mine . i prefer this any day over exact-o knife . you don't turn paper cut . just ' trace ' tool , it cuts you . super easy make openings small doors windows . lots fun easy use . however , it must used either paper or light card stock . nothing heavy . well worth investment	1
well , it christmas day 2006 this present huge disappointment our 6 10 year old , well myself , 39 year old ! photographs show children holding pen angle , way kids normally color draw , however , you hold this vertical paper all times , you move it slow snail order allow holes close enough together so you " cut " . even then , results disappointing . i love draw craft , this " cutter " going back box because both my children hated it . now , i figure out what it . it not even something i would pass anyone else kids , tell you truth . i bought this brand new store , so i doubt it malfunctioning . i read other positive reviews am puzzled because they love it . if you like sitting there moving tool snail pace , getting perforated line , then you probably like using this crayola cutter . if you expect anything more , then you disappointed . my advice would try out friend before you buy .	-1

bought this my 3 year old because it says 3+ . i decided listen it before giving it her any parent who cares what their preschoolers listen , this product not you . i don't think children her age should listening songs " trouble " boys chasing girls . product itself great idea very easy children age use their own , but my 3 year old no longer using this toy	-1
if you want keep your sanity you not buy this toy ! i read reviews before i bought this my son should taken them heart ! he wanted it so badly . i could used $ this other things ! this so hard but back together once you get it open . it so frustrating . i didn't realize it so many little parts put together keep track once opened . it very loud not sure what sound supposed . i think subway train . it doesn't come batman so all 6 batman we not fit .. my 51/2 year old very disapointed he gets so frustrated when playing this	-1
i two words you ... bat droppings . this definitely worst $50 i ever spent . it flimsy , it doesn't go back together , getting it together took engineering degree . i wish i read up it before buying it .	-1

my 20-month-old son lot toys , but this one he gone back several times throughout day plays it pretty long stretches , around 30 minutes each time which very long him ! his favorite so far blue room singing playdate . he loves doodleboard roarysaurus pages . he figured out how work everything within 15 minutes . we took it my parents ' house so he would something play while we there everyone curious it . soon my 6-year-old nephew 8-year-old niece huddled up my son front fireplace they all played it together long time . then my brother oldest daughter , who 12 , just see what big deal soon she playing , too ! even adults give it try . it very entertaining everyone , younger kids really engaged it , especially my son . screen dark but lights light up under parts page , you see pretty clearly . i think they could designed it bit better , but my son nor i any trouble seeing correct areas push . each cartridge so many learning opportunities great songs , we plan buy them all , even older ones original player . i am very impressed sensitivity screen . it seems just perfect , unlike reviewer , we haven't any trouble it not giving us correct response when pushing certain picture . my son touch enough make it work but if you accidentally brush your fingers across it while carrying or whatever it won't start singing out blue . far durability goes , my son handling this toy great care because he adores it so much , but it seems very sturdy carrying handle nice . it bit heavy him carry himself yet it larger than i thought it would , but it perfect size him set floor front him play . back unit angled such way so if toy placed floor or your child lap , it better position seeing screen . lastly , sound . it bit loud , even lower setting , but it not enough annoying or me worry it damaging his ears . it always noisy our busy house anyway , so extra volume helps though i would preferred slightly lower setting well quiet times . all all i think it fantastic toy great learning tool . songs catchy memorable easily help remember lesson taught . it great entertainment education same time . highly recommended ! oh , please note player pictured here not plus system , it original . plus player silver color more square shaped than one pictured . we love play record microphone it same price original player , so definitely go plus version if you	1
when visiting her older cousins , my daughter got play this toy , which belonged my 3 year old nephew . he special needs , very hard toys . he would drop it , throw it step it hourly basis . fact it still worked like champ after least 6 months him owning it miracle itself . they sent us one gift my daughter , 13 months , after seeing how much she liked it , she cannot get enough this toy ! i love it durable , literally - she stands it sometimes , it fallen i don't know how many times . it not too big her carry around or manipulate , she figured out how work it immediately . now just listening songs , watching screen rotate making noises into microphone keeps her happy . but her older cousins love educational games cartridges they , really get kick out singing into microphone . cartridges big sturdy , easy child put himself if they old enough . it would nice if microphone cord longer , but i'm guessing it would safety hazard make it longer . teh speaker really loud but some clear packing tape over it muffled it enough our comfort . lower volume control would nice . overall , i've seen it work 13 month old , 3 year old 5 year old . if it broke i would replae it immediately , only one other toy we own gets more mileage	1
excellent product . carry it around conversation piece . however , some might need warned : his visage may drive you insane .	1

i old verion radica freecell game 12 months , but wished it lit up dark . hey presto , someone must heard me now my husband even closer divorcing me- ( only joking . he says he won't , providing i keep sound effects turned off ! ) this new upgraded model game superb especially ' low light ' feature . now i antisocial day or night !!! joking aside , cards much easier read , scroll up down buttons far more easy handle than original ' roller ' buttons much bigger which makes chances mistakes fewer . next upgrade , there any chance ' undo last move ' button reduce curse words when i mess up ???	1

bought this my daughter she loved it . so much i eventually hide it periods time moments peace quiet . then without any notice it stopped working after 4 months use . before it stopped working i would given it 4 star rating . 1 star deduction because even though it ability accept power adapter , they not include one . if you don't buy one , you go through quite few batteries . we use rechargeable batteries all our toys , so i chose not buy power adapter it . thankfully , i didn't or i would spent more money now useless lump plastic . ************************ updated after my intial review ... my husband opened product up found it fuse blew . it required someone who knows electronics able diagnose what problem . luckily , we such person our house . we saved item . but i not change my rating because average household probably wouldn't gone through trouble . it required multi-meter , new fuse soldering kit . i wonder how many these keyboards would saved if only they made case so fuse accessable . $3 worth supplies 45 min time , ours now working again	-1

i seen boys girls ages 2 8 captivated uncle milton " moon my room . " adult , frankly i think it pretty cool too ! moon model contured , textured surface . it couple inches thick , curved , so it real depth . moon cycles through 12 different phases . i not seen any evidence light turning automatically after dark , advertised , but it works fine manually or activating automatic 5-seconds per phase cycle . moon lit up light within plastic not glow dark when it turned off . moon my room advertised appropriate ages 6 up , but since it mounted wall i don't see why it can't go toddler room long remote control secured . i echo previous reviewer comment you need keep track remote , i don't think it would work otherwise	1
just like what advertized . i teach high school it mounted my cinder block wall . it moves demos moon phases well . fun all ages . i would recommend it one all	1

blade cpp good , responsive heli attractive price . this only my third model helicopter , so i added training gear flat-bottomed rotors soften it bit help protect it my goofs . i've flying mine couple weeks now i really enjoy added precision outdoor performance compared fixed-pitch helis same price range . heli very lightly built carbon fiber , aluminum reinforced plastic bits . you preflight it when you get it make sure everything tight , but that just proper procedure . mine came out box balanced adjusted almost perfectly , very pleasant experience . there lot upgrade parts available blade if you want go way , but stock setup pretty good . i suggest getting extra battery pack , since they take 1.5 hr charge i hate waiting . other worthwhile upgrades include stronger motors heading-lock gyro , but those may not helpful you until you've gained some experience start trying more advanced maneuvers . flight stability medium , since it aerobatic bird . priority this heli seems responsiveness maneuverability . it reacts immediately control inputs not take well overcontrolling , so hovering challenge learn . once you're comfortable quick response , it easy fly , but it takes practice get there . this not beginner heli without help unless you're unusually quick learner . if you haven't flown rc helicopters before just take it out zoom into air , you crash , probably lot . if you're still considering this starter , you should get simulator like excellent realflight 3.5 practice before you try real thing ( you save much more than cost simulator repair parts you didn't buy ) . you'll better off still if you look rc flying club your area so you mix talk others who help you start off .	1

this 2nd biggest set duplo bob builder series , but it seems most pleasing playwise , it comes building opening windows door , table chairs , bob , his cat , travis . it also comes trailer put house , it towed travis . while scoop lofty set two vehicles it , buildings not build up much anything , so you would just end up more loose blocks around house ( big set 80+ pieces ) . i couldn't justify spending extra money it either . i recommend this one best series . my son loves these sets , but he also thomas duplos tends spend more time playing those .	1

my parents bought this pool big summer party they , ton kids used it ( i'd estimate 20 kids , mostly under 7 years , out it all day ) . then i took it home set up my daughter 5th birthday , which saw 8 kids jumping , swimming spalshing it . we've used it daily since then ( all summer ) . it small pin-hole after first use probably happened moving it our house ( back truck ) , but easily patched clear liquid nails . we haven't any trouble deflating , collapsing , leaking , etc . since then . it pain drain water because weight full pool keeps water getting out small drain hole bottom ( we've tried grass driveway - even overnight thing still full ) . i let air out top 2 rings get water out . but we bought large bicyle-type pump ( pool section toysrus ) which works ok - air compressor would better . it get dirty - particularly our hard water . so even cover chlorine i dump water every few days . it would nice filter , but then again - it only $30 pool . i give kids butterfly net them get grass out when they playing pool . kids absolutely love it ( i 3 obnoxious little monsters , 3 , 5 7 years ) they give it pretty strenuous workout every day . it held up well hopefully still useable next year . really hot days , i even get them , i see why they love it . they really swim it , rather than " wade " like they little plastic one . it won't compare easy-set type pools filters etc ., but it great kiddie-pool . i plan this pool or one like it least few more years	1
there little assembly required , but nothing too hard . you just need hammer , pliers flat head screwdriver . radioflyer logos sides stickers you place yourself . my 20 month old loves put his toys this wagon pull them around . it fairly light so if you child likes throw things , you might find this flying through air . other than , it quite durable . it more likely cause damage what it hits than itself . also if you particularly tall toddler , handle may little short . it 13 " floor it tallest	1
my daughter got this christmas loves spin ball round round , only complaint i it letters little tough toddlers push .. so all she hears abc song over over ... i push letters so she hear sound alphabet .. but overall it great toy she still continues play it .	1

i find this set just little more than my 14 month old use right now . although he loves all pieces , he doesn't understand reindeer pull sleigh houses little light-weight doors little too small really easy him use . i think this big hit next christmas season . oh , ours came " hard-t o-o pen " package ( i hate those ) , not white box .	1

if you need few curves pinch , this decent set . only reason i give it 4 stars there better " road pack " set out there . i highly recommend getting beginner roadway expansion pack ( http://www.amazon.com/learning-curve-thomas-friends-railway/dp/b000062sqm ) . if you math , buying two these sets ( which you'll need , trust me ) verses one beginner roadway expansion : $7 dollars you get few straight track more imporantly , train/road cross piece ( which only available few other track/road sets ) . if you don't bertie , beginner roadway expansion better deal ( if you bertie , either use it spare bertie or give bertie someone else xmas) !	1

this game so fun !!! i played it whole lot back when it first came out 10 years ago . wore out cards ! it best 5 8 people , so it not one you'll just playing your sweetheart , but it absolutely blast when you 5 or more . it simple - very simple . luck required but little ( little ! ) bit strategy comes into it too . rounds over very quickly - probably 5 minute rounds , seating order changes each round based who goes out first . go out first you're " great dalmuti " next round . take your choice best chair , make everybody pay you tribute ! especially " great peon ! " ( last person go out last round ) . we would always play up role higher lower classes , peons not allowed talk directly dalmuti , etc . ( it more fun way ) awesome party game or great family game if you enough people	1

this toy took " santa " hours put together it falling apart within 24hr . period . we ended up throwing it away	-1
my favorite part building this thing when parts actaully popped off base becuase they didnt fit where they should . i made it all way 2nd floor , then when trying connect 2nd floor 1st floor every part ended up falling apart . luckily i found it buyout place $10 ( i plan returning it ) , i cant imagine spending $30-40 bucks this ! if you dont kids ( mine 4 year old ) plenty glue/tape/frosting/termite spit then i supose you could eventually make good looking batcave keep top shelf away small children , house pets sudden bursts air	-1

i purchased this toy my daughter when she 16 months old . i hoping it'd similar bumble balls they used make early 90s , but it not . while my daughter found it interesting liked toy , it much heavier than i anticipated . children like throw drop things , i not recommend this toy . i constantly worried she would drop it her toes or my toes . when it crash ground , it made horrible loud noise . i am amazed it not break ( so it seem durable least ) not seem damage my floors . i ended up dubbing it " cannon ball " quietly disposed it some months later when my daughter seemed less interested it	1

i recently purchased this laser tag set my nephews : 6 years old 8 years old . i couldn't believe how complicated they made this classic game ! there least 10 buttons gun : trigger , shields , ammo reload , " option " , sound on/off , indoor/outdoor , " 2nd " ?, like 5 others underneath lcd screen . all i wanted put batteries this thing watch my cousins shoot each other . instead i spend 15 minutes reading instruction manual . there no off switch either me reset game start over ( follow instructions ) . youngest getting frustrated because he holding down reload button which wouldn't let him fire . he actually crying saying , " this doesn't work ! " . all i wanted simple classic laser tag my childhood : turn shoot . not say this game isn't fun older kids . my opinion , though , hasbro gone way overboard ruined perfectly good game	1

settlers catan fantastic game , it would seem board game world means sequel inevitable . so , eventually seafarers catan ( kosmos mayfair games , 1997 - klaus teuber ) released . it fitting expansion , so simple add-on rules , i almost always include it base game . game offers very few more choices expansion included , amount scenarios included book excellent ; some them truly fun ! seafarers expansion adds number things base game , including ... 1 . ) gold fields : these basically " wild " hexes produce whatever resource player wants if they settlement or city bordering them . this makes gold fields very valuable , everyone wanting piece action . scenarios counter this putting gold fields hard reach places , less than optimal number them , like " 3 " . still , it doesn't stop me trying get them ! 2 . ) water hexes : well adding some additional hexes each five resources ( gold hexes ) , twelve water hexes added game . when combined fourteen edge pieces hold all hexes together , one create many maps - many more than one island . when using water hexes , players usually start their first two settlements one island , then must expand other islands . edge pieces hold board together large rectangle , keeping tiles sliding around table . cities knights also comes frame ; but it more hexagonal one , allowing only setup basic game - so i prefer seafarers one more . 3 . ) ships : players expand seas ship pieces . each player receives fifteen ship pieces their color beginning game . ships cost one wool one lumber build ( this raises value wool ) . ships placed two water hexes act similar roads . fact , longest road ( now called longest trade route ) now includes ships well roads . first ship must built next settlement shore , then placed adjacent other ships . ships also move , if they last ship " open " shipping lane ( not connect two cities ) . players may move one ship per turn , location they could built . this makes ships sound more exciting than they really - reality , they aren't moved often . but either way , ships big improvement , they only way get other islands . players allowed start ship instead road if one their starting settlements coastline . ships crux game ( why it called " seafarers " ) ; while they don't add much terms complexity , they add one more option players explore make games more interesting . 4 . ) special victory points : some scenarios award special victory points - tokens included game . many times this occurs when player lands new island . this allows scenario dictate change strategy bit variety game . 5 . ) pirate ship : pirate ship added game counterpoint robber . whenever player rolls " 7 " , they may move pirate ship instead robber , placing pirate any ocean hex . player then steal one resource one players who ship adjacent hex . new ships can't placed next pirate , giving even more reason move him . either way , it seems robber moved lot less games involving pirate . this actually increases power robber , game get slightly nastier . if robber stifling production your best cities/settlements dozens turns , it get rather annoying . players must think even more carefully when moving robber/pirate , soldier cards become much more useful . 6 . ) scenarios : there eleven scenarios included book , some them rather good , others good maybe one play or two . either way , if player would get tired these scenarios , there plenty more available internet . first scenario , " new shores " , played many times , it basically generic setup seafarers . last two scenarios require multiple sets basic settlers , so i'm not sure how often they'll come into play . seafarers offers lot variety settlers without adding very many rules - probably best epitaph expansion . i won't say it necessary ; indeed , one play settlers many times without expansion never miss it . but i doubt you would return basic settlers after trying seafarers - especially when you see variety it includes . i'm certainly glad i picked expansion up ; settlers fans enjoy it greatly . tom vasel " real men play board games . " ( ...	1

before i decided purchase this item my children , i what i always : jump amazon.com check out reviews . my surprise , there weren't any . so , i hopped over leapfrog.com view synopsis . leapfrog doesn't even list this game available title their site . next , i google search try find review this title i directed sega website . i clicked link sonic game directed , suprisingly enough , back leapfrog website , where no results found . talk hitting brick wall ... so , i took chance i bought it my 4 1/2 year-old son add his ever-growing collection leapster titles . it hit . both he my daughter love it . they actually played sonic game last night instead wii which they playing daily since christmas . we actually pry leapster out my son hands just get him into bed . game , i my reservations since this game seems produced sega opposed leapfrog ; so i wasn't sure if it would same educational themes most leapfrog games . while theme this game much more video game based than most leapfrog games , it also very educational . not played any sonic game titles seem so popular , i only compare it games i am familiar . graphics remind me little bit super mario brothers , some challenges seem follow similar themes . also , game set up into different zones , which each different activity . example , one activities game teaches addition you add blocks top screen . once you think you answer , you find it board while taking care avoid wrong answers . activities teaches your child how count backward following sequence top screen , then racing find next number . all while , you collect little gold rings each stage game which added top screen . some stages timed , so you can't take too long figure out answer . there also activities teach number sequencing subtraction . each activity three different skill levels choose . target age this product listed kindergarten 1st grade . i bought it my 4 1/2 year-old he doing very well it , but he much stronger math than reading writing . i think this great game preschool kindergarten aged children help reinforce number recognition , counting simple math concepts very fun way . frame reference , my son also enjoys following leapster titles : counting zero , mr. pencil , learning leap , letters loose , mole huge nose , cars , letter factory , kindergarten , spongebob cars . if your child similar interests , he or she most likely enjoy this game . if you looking reinforce your child mathematical concepts , i recommend this game or counting zero . update : leapfrog updated their website past few days least show this title , although it listed " coming soon " . hope this helps .	1

this good addition our son duplo/quatro/lego sets , letting him integrate two fun bob builder characters into his building repertoire . reviewer noted , there aren't enough other blocks much this set alone . it , however , offer some dynamic play , such combining scoop lofty parts into elongated dual-action vehicle ( scoop front , crane back , etc . ) , well integrating some action pieces into buildings ( crane , example , could stationary building rather than vehicle , vehicle base allows expanded use other block sets even if scoopy lofty parts aren't used .	1

wonderful item bought off amazon , [ ... ] ok onto item itself . it wasent hard put together but easier two people . price wheel cover some other parts plastic , they should metal instead just main frame handles durability . back tires plastic like what you would find 3 wheel hot wheel . which good skidding out but if it used alot wont hold up long not very thick . fun factor , son love it so i give it thumbs up . far educational , really its not meant but help tune coordination . overall it worth its weight gold if your kid loves it , plus frame limited lifetime warranty	1

i must admit i've skeptical leapfrog claims their products educational . my son enjoys his leappad , it certainly entertains him , but i've wondered if he actually learned anything . tad great day letter factory changed my view . first time i popped it reader , we sat worked it nearly hour . i couldn't believe it ! my son typically spends 15 20 minutes working leappad book , so this shocking me . then , characteristically he wanted it again . presently , my son owns 12 leappad books . tad great day letter factory his current favorite , it receives lot attention . he loves trace letters , especially letter " i " because it " i , i , i , icky ..., " " because it goes , , , yeah ! " activities fun preschoolers , william enjoys silly sayings , interactive play . mazes challenging too . example , final maze asks you pick up letter(s ) deliver them specific location . activity requires children listen instructions , find recognize letter(s ) , follow path deliver them . it offers praise way , which preschoolers appreciate . william recently started asking questions words . instance , other day he asked if word " car " started " , " or " " because it " , , " sound . last night he told me his pizza , , , hot like letter " . " i think interactive play , focus phonics leappad reading writing books making difference his comprehension . two things consider before purchasing writing book : firstly , don't leave preschooler unattended pencil , second , let them practice two , or three times before you erase pages . i learned hard way my son , pencil dangerous combination . after william got hang book i stepped out room unload dishwasher , when i came back there all sorts scribbling marks pages . magic pencil automatically feeds when lead gets low , but you tap it couple times it work . this frustrates my son , he'll start banging darn thing , scrawling get it work . it trick , but makes horrible mess . also , plan spend least 30-minutes erasing pages this book . i keep eraser out my son reach , because every time he sees it , he wants use it . pages crinkle , they tear off binding too much friction . my only gripe tad great day letter factory , short all erasing , it only features upper case letters . you purchase kindergarten book work both upper , lower case letters , so if your child already practicing his letters i recommend kindergarten book instead . overall , it very helpful , i believe my son actually learning this book .	1
i got my first k'nex set my kids ( well , myself well ) when my son 4 . k'nex allows kids make innumerable constructs . enclosed book gets their imagination flowing , additional instructions web site further enhance , but then kids let loose their own ideas . my son now 11 my daughter 8 they still coming up new imaginative creations . k'nex not intricate detail lego . however , long rods , connecting pieces , allow construction sturdy models ( long bridges/tall buildings ) pieces generic enough they reused over over different purposes . its great	1
these guns great ! we purchased one each our boys . balls not hurt , they not hit hard enough break things house , gun not require batteries , simple easy use . i think everyone family played some time . worth money	1
gotta love different types rubber duckies hitting market nowadays . i gotta love accroutrements unique take classic bath tub toy , rubber duckie . one my personal favorite rubber duckies i own dead rubber duckie . it too cute too funny . this dead duckie should own anyone who into goth culture . dead duckie slightly smaller its devil duckie cousins . i like drop blood hangs below his lip crossed out eyes . this must rubber duckie collectors . it nice contrast its yellow cousins	1
this great game ! dvds really make it come alive . i couldn't imagine this game without music , images , film clips , other various forms dynamism dvds . game great fun teach most people great deal star wars . word caution order , though . if you would never call yourself " star wars fan , " then you probably able answer only handful questions during any particular game . fact , even most " diehard " fans likely find few questions leave them scratching their heads .	1
there nothing like getting together fellow star wars fans play this special version trivial pursuit . it great ! it just like old trivial pursuit , course , questions only star wars . when you try wedge , however , you resort one two dvds come game question . if you don't answer question time limit given , your oponents shout out right answer - long they don't wedge - possibly steal it you . if you like classic trivial pursuit you happen star wars fan you couple like-minded friends or family members , this lot fun definitely worth money	1
this product horrible !!!!! i send first one back because it broke second day my child it . it took several weeks us get new one when it finally come it broke after three days use .	-1
my mom gave me this game i am finding it very hard put down . it very fun addictive . i no instructions but it very easy figure out . this great take you anywhere you might wait ( makes time fly ) . i too , wish it lighted but i still love it	1
one hand held yahtzee game plus time play winning combination . it seems i belong select group folks who can't stop playing electronic hand held yahtzee game ! i enjoyed it immensely , but beware , once you start playing it hard put down ! yahtzee great passing time anywhere . it same setup regular yahtzee . you get three tries score before you select where put your total . lots fun trying beat highest score previous games played . fun play while waiting trains , boats , or doctor appointments . we one car even bathroom . only trouble it it hard stop playing ! great game , great fun . ~ mrs. .	1
when you're playing this easy carry hand help game , you'll amazed how hour or two slip unnoticed . perfectly honest , i wasn't ever big fan traditional yahtzee game , so when i received this little electronic version christmas , i only mildly amused . then i began playing . not only i pick it up nearly every free second i , but my roommate steals it away when she . it fairly simple learn rules figure out strategy . after , it hours frustrating excitment	1
old favorite when my kids young - easily learned , but challenging strategies must developed . plenty stimulus agressive-minded who like thwart their opponents . fun adults well children	1
very easy 7-year-old operate , indoors outdoors . fun play more so if you 2 them . sturdy construction	1
great fun play old game old dog new fun way , especially appeals kids under 40	1
my mom i playing this game every night this week after i fished it out closet ( she bought it us few christmases ago , but it went largely ignored , because my brother reluctant play ) . though one-on-one isn't much fun group game , we fun because we're almost evenly matched . she 56 her years knowledge her side , watches lot television , quite good pink , yellow , blue categories . she also travel agent , so her knowledge geography quite sharp ... but she abysmal guesser . if she doesn't know answer , more often than not , she'll throw down silliest thing you've ever heard , answer defies even most basic logic . other hand , i'm 18 disadvantage either not born or toddler through half 20 years this game covers . but i working knowledge modern pop culture news , am good green , yellow , blue categories , -- truth told -- am probably bit smarter than mom . she hasn't beaten me yet , but our past several games extremely close ! half fun game inevitable jokes spring it ... we invented our own trivial pursuit term " michael dukakis " recurring person , place , or thing keeps popping up questions answers throughout game , because during our first game , michael dukakis just wouldn't leave me alone ( it seemed like ) every card i given ( even now , when michael dukakis mentioned question or answer , we burst into laughter ) . i wish we could delete orange category , because i know next nothing sports , mom only slightly better . brown category also haunts us , but i am fluent comics , so i advantage there . no matter what , you'll probably missing lot questions , so just prepared ( my games played two very intelligent people , so i imagine situation worse among those less trivia prowess ) . but we've ton fun , , perhaps , maybe you , too	1
game still fun , but many questions so incredibly inane no one would ever know them . who really knows who wrote default ditty plays when microsoft windows boots up ? board low quality flimsy ; it won't even lay flat table , so dice don't stay it well . reviewer implied only uneducated people would think questions too hard , but my husband i both finishing out master degrees emory , we both found game boring frustrating	-1
molded plastic not stay kid shoulders soon my grandson raises his arms if fly , cape drops down his back shield pulls against his neck chokes him . i am so disappointed . he would love it otherwise but not wear it because it painful . not waste your money	-1
my 16 month old daughter loves little people play sets . toys perfect size little hands imaginations . she plays these items every day her 11 year old brother ! ( who decides age range these anyway ? )	1
we bought this our 2 daughters . yes , there little tiny pieces yes , it take long time put these all up . however , end result so great . there enough stars cover ceiling walls so it really feel like you out under stars . sticker pieces don't hold glow long plastic pieces but whole effect room wonderful . it lasts least hour . i similar set my son room when he younger . set didn't glow nearly long these stars . now bedtime , we all head into girls room enjoy effect	1
when sticking stars up ceiling , don't use putty provided , heat makes them fall down within few days . so instead use hot glue gun silicon it doesn't ruin your stars or ceiling paint they wont fall off ... thats what i used start previous experience .	1
i bought this item jsut 2 years ago thinking it cool e-mail things but no only well math htings like it very good laptop learning if you check your e-mail you would hook this wire computer no reason just use computer ( ...	-1
i just got vohrak he rocks !!! way beat him hit his head down kraata pop out	1
this rahkshi one my fovorites . i like this one because vohrak very fun play , he immitate just every human position . his back he carries kraata pop out pushing his head down holder , holder case pop open , kratta fly out it . his knees bend , his legs , his arms , also his head move around too . sometimes you may too ajust his legs feet him stay up , but he stands up prety well . his arms also move side side up down . vohrak also folded up certain way stored his container he came . he also combined two other rahkshi , panrahk guurahk	1
if you like scrabble , you love this game . this present my daughter she loves it ! fact , she usually beats me . if you looking fun or exciting challenge , this game great	1
i used this game my son when he 5 we would spell words then going upwards we could change word such " bat " " cat " etc . he would come up endless changes really got understand his phonics well improve his spelling reading skills . if you child just getting hang phonics this encourage your child learn while fun mom or dad .	1

my husband i bought this garage sale $3 friend . i'd furious if i bought this store . we both musicians it kills our ears everytime man sings there . my child loves playing it but it probably tossed out door everyone sanity .	-1
my son this toy couple months , he 1 now , he definately hasnt gotten tired it ! he just loves any toy plays music , he loves animal noises . this toy it all him ! he gets so happy when music goes he starts clapping bounce dancing , very cute ! good things : -there lots different songs noises phrases ( each thing you push 3 different things ) so i havent gotten annoyed it ... yet course . -you push each animal while song playing remainder song sung " moos " " oinks " or " baas " ( so cute ! ) , roll duck thing song speed up . -the keyboard 5 big keys say numbers , colors , or play music . -the storyboard two songs seperated plastic page easy little ones turn back forth . -the sun top toy lights up when anything going , also rocked back forth start new song . -there volume control - very good . -this toy not too big not too small , takes normal aa batteries . things not so good ? : -i see how fingers might get wegded under pig , but this hasnt happened my little explorer ; or if it he figured out pull his hand out without fussing , it easy he smart boy . -the toy start sing itself if left alone minute , which good or bad . it stops after little while if not touched . -the singer off-key every now then , but come it baby toy ! unless you're training your baby 9 months become next american idol , it perfectly fine ! bottom line : one best toys i've ever seen it keeps my baby busy learning dancing	1
friend bought this our 7-month-old daghter she loves it . i see this quickly becoming her favorite toy . she loves keyboards toys respond pushes pokes , but most toys this type we own switches buttons too stiff her manipulate . she hasn't built up strength play these toys yet , but vtech farm different . all buttons knobs easy move so she play it easily . it clearly designed help her develop fine motor skills i see her developing these skills this toy already . she figured out pulling pushing dog get it make noises banging keys get them play notes . i expect her discover other way play this soon . only part toy i don't like generic look all animals . dog looks like cow which looks like pig . i would prefer it if animals looked less cartoonish more distinguishable so my daughter associate them their names toy talks her . reviewer mentioned his daughter got her hand caught under pig few times , so this something we watch out . one note " actor " providing sound bites : he can't sing ! other reviews mentioned it , but my wife i don't find it annoying ... just hilarious ! right now , i think we get more entertainment this toy than our daughter while we laugh this poor sap struggle through " mary little lamb " . it seems obvious some manager or executive vtech decided save few bucks figured he could all sound bites himself . results get you rolling aisles . if you happen see this display local toy store , pause minute laugh it ( you turn it play it while it still packaging ) .	1
you really can't go wrong geotrax . we've collecting sets two years now old sets get just much play new ones . i two boys ages three six so geotrax really get workout . they easy enough them put together themselves . not one piece track broken we're talking two rough-and-tumble boys using them . variety you all different sets great too . one my boys likes trains other likes construction vehicles , so they each their favs . battery life great too . we use rechargable batteries recharge once week daily use . i just can't say enough great things geotrax . keep'em coming	1
this good addition geotrax collection but i would make sure you high chimes clock tower your collection first . clock tower also motion sensor sounds . it also ability accomodate different elevations ( opens up great world building possibilities ! ) unlike rocky falls tunnel . final reason i would go item first it probably discontinued first so get it while you . :) rocky falls ' tunnel pretty nifty . i wish there way choose which soundtrack gets played or least way just turn nature sounds . since you turn wheel your own ( rather than relying geomotion ) it would just cool if you could operate water sounds go it . building seems bit limited this item . you either choose forgo using whole tunnel or you build train large enough accomodate crossroad . not big deal , just something plan around . finally , we bought 2 these this week . first one lubricant like film over one pieces ( one houses main unit , one battery compartment ) . i contacted f.p. they said it not normal . ( i didn't think it ! ) . so , we shipping it back them exchange $20 voucher . they no replacement items stock so we just bought new one . it residue free . just wanted make note this case it happens someone else . geotrax awesome this good addition your collection . just make sure you buy older items first ! you don't want search discontinued item they showing product inserts or box . :	1

lego 2006 technic lineup features vehicles not only fun play , but also recreating technical aspects today construction material handling industries . telehandler no exception . $30 us you get build not only telehandler , but also front-end loader . both models feature rear-wheel steering very realistic functions similar machines they replicating . main model this set front bucket not only raises up down tilts , but also telescopes out quite far . i realize lot technic enthusiasts aren't crazy integration smooth liftarms instead traditional studded beams , but many models created last few years look much more life-like smooth , curved liftarms . all all , good value your money	1
i bought 2 these lamps . one each daughter . they loud vibrate/move around little table . medrmaids other items inside would not float around water . i threw both lamps away but kept miniature mermaids . girls play them bathtub but unfortunately , mermaids so small we lost few down drain	-1
yes , this lamp make humming water noise similar fish tank ... but how you expect less product filled water ? we use it bed time well during day . very cute swimming polly pockets well fish ect included . you change color reflected bottom . water ( even dry heat ) not evaperate quickly . i give this lil tank a+ .	1
this toy wonderful , very similar block patterns my childhood . my children ( ages 5 , 3 , 1 ) all loved it , older two building designs , younger " helping " . i would definetly recommend toy it fun educational many ages- something important our house . however , if you lots blocks your house , these blocks ( which needed designs ) lost mixed up your other blocks . we labeled blocks , which made keeping them separate possible , but unless you strict policy not combining toys your house ( not much fun this toy ) prepared some blocks find their way somewhere else , thereby making it impossible use patterns .	1
my son smitten ariel ever since we got back disney world last summer . so i bought him this set christmas he thrilled . figurines include ariel , prince eric , max ( eric dog ) , sebastian , flounder , king triton , ursula . my son made diorama underwater scene christmas day -- complete characters ! -- while my artistic husband crafted ship out cardboard . he affixed ship top diorama , placing prince eric ( telescope ) crow nest while max deck . if your little one ( or even " big one " ! ) fan little mermaid , they'll entranced attractive package figurines this set .	1
my son owned previous version this " garbage " truck 2 years . his orange but other than it looks same , so i hope this review still relevant . what i would like say when we bring this truck park other children flock around it . noises it makes sound real , lever arms dumping always please . it thrashed lots kids still soldiers . educational value comes seeing how those big dumpster-collecting trucks work . i'm not certain , but this truck seems accurate depiction . addition here good part , this truck lived backyard year now rained months . however , it still works ! i thought sure batteries would corroded but they weren't . long live orange " garbage " truck !	1
better than i expected - big hit - packaged shipped great	1

i highly recomend this webkinz koala everybody who webkinz . it comes wacky eucalyptus television . get koala	1
object game basically simple . read one songs card based where you landed board try hum and/or use charades so your team guess song . it what it , if this sounds fun , then there no reason you won't like it . problem songs contained within , while varied , mostly pretty old . even those contemporary category go back 1970s . i'm 24 years old could only recognize 15% songs , rendering game unplayable me . theory you pantomime title even if you don't know song , but it difficult this songs like " hey , jude " " theme mash . " my parents grandparents otherhand recognized nearly everything . this would great them , but not me . so i write this informative review so you'll know what kinds songs you'll getting . this really isn't game kids or young adults going able play .	1
my son wanted electronic baseball christmas , however , after reading many reviews amazon.com i convinced it bad product . i came across front porch games circa baseball thought it looked like one arcade games my husband son enjoyed . i not disappointed . took us some time get homeruns figured out but now we it great . what i also like we leave it out coffee table decorative piece everyone who comes over can't resist it take few swings . i would suggest this product anyone whose looking some good clean family fun	1
i ordered this because i liked look , thought it would neat addition my game collection . my delight , it also turns out great fun ! it basically pinball style game , but even without electronics all , it joy play . friend who wants play ? it easy follow basic baseball rules play through nine innings . swing bat get single , double , triple , home run , or even get out ! much like real baseball , you'll work get some points board . added bonus , this game easy assemble beautiful behold . it stays out nicely , decorative piece your game room or addition any sports memorabilia collection . i'm not even sports fan , i love this game . it good return simple fun , value added craftsmanship	1

despite reviewer warning , i ordered faucet light . or without " adapter " , this light would not fit any faucets my home .	-1
i love horses . i 2 them . so i naturally attracted this glamerous doll . i read review girl did`nt get accesories . i don`t this doll so i don`t know . she her own story one . she nice style riding horses her boots her shoes look nice . it does`nt look wierd like brats flimsy hats . ( whitch suppossed collectibles way . ) i don`t know horses , but i think they could go anyone . conclusion , i think this doll well worth your money . it`s not much either . 7.00 some odd change really good price doll	1

alrighty . firstly , i enjoy both barbie bratz seies dolls . they both thier pros cons ... get over it , but both flaws ! anyway ... barbie copieing bratz , yes they , but bratz also copies barbie . example this : barbie first released swapping heads : my scene dolls . then bratz followed ... all toy manufacturing companies copy each other ideas make money . that right all ! bratz pain remove box : yes . they . but they not glued place , they tied place . if you not mind ripping box or cutting it , it easy enough . however , if you wish keep it all intact , it pain time consuming . now stop this nonsense , enjoy your dolls	1

ds started sitting bebepod when he 8 weeks old , soon he could support his own head . age , all his other " seats " ( swing , high chair , car seat , stroller , etc ) him semi-reclining position , where he resting back his head ( , " back sleep " campaign prevent sids , contributes prevalence " flat head " many babies today ) . before baby able sit up himself , aside us holding him up or his relatively brief tummy times , this best ( only ) way him upright his own ! there really nothing else like it market . he loved freedom able turn his head upper body around interact his arms . he sat it play , eat , watch tv , or just hang out us . he really loved sitting independently , like big boy ! we bought both bumbo bebepod , since we couldn't decide which get initially , we used one upstairs one downstairs . honest , they really very similar , except bebepod more aesthetically pleasing . its styling pretty pastel colors much nicer than bumbo loud ugly colors . both made low-density foam , which looks smooth like plastic but feels soft comfortable touch . both lightweight easily wipes clean . it great seat take you park , beach , or grandma house . bumbo seat designed so baby butt dips further down quite bit further seat than his legs . , arm rests , seem support him better when he small ( around 8-14 weeks ) . however , after he grew bigger , bebepod seems bit more comfortable him , since his bottom isn't dipped down low it maintains his posture better . without arm rests , his arms able reach his toys more easily bebepod . also , he likes rest his hands or his toys center pommel bebepod , where his toys often fall off when he bumbo . ( our pommel seems very secure , we not experience other reviewers ' complaints it coming off . ) note : this not chair which you should leave your child unattended . since it not any buckles , it possible child wiggle himself out seat arching his back once he little older . we usually keep seat carpet , so he stays safe even if he manage get himself out it . ( it only happened once when he 6 months old . ds 8.5 months old now . ) sometimes , we place seat table or chair order feed him , but then he always closely monitored . update : ds now 11-months old . after he became adept sitting his own , unsupported , bebepod bumbo no longer necessary . he liked crawl stand , so confining nature these infant seats no longer appropriate . however , we're still happy our purchase . seats served their purpose we keep them next baby . summary , this great infant seat , which we would definitely purchase again . however , before you make your decision , realize usage it may limited approximately 6 months or so , depending your child .	1

this absolutely best pull toy ever ! my daughter given several others , but she loved this one best . she fascinated how he moves his arms up down plays xlyophone . i think because she could see how music played instead just some electrical sounds coming out it like they other pull toys .	1

i bought this unit after post-christmas toys began take over my 2-year old room . whe it arrived , i really disappointed its size ! yes , i'd checked out specifications web before ordering , knew it wasn't ' full-size ' ... but really , thing tiny ! this would really great piece very small children learn how put away their toys , individual bins help keep things organized . but , it horribly unsturdy tykes just learning stand still leaning furniture . if little tikes going ' toddler-size ' angle , they need re-think narrow base make it more stable . or , if it meant used independently pre-schoolers , it should larger , accommodate their growing toys bodies . only other complaint i smell - ' fabric ' bins came out package incredibly strong smell factory - bit like burning hair or plastic ... it so awful , i air our entire unit day porch before putting it my son room ... i've never , ever problem new item smelling bad like before . we've now owned this unit 3 months , i enjoy able let ' everything it place ' my son room . i also love traditional , bright colors - they're fun , but not too juvenile , go any changes i make room decor my son moves toddler preschool phase . i also very pleased strength shelves - we some pretty heavy toys stacked top shelf while keep them out my son reach , it held up just fine . all , i'd recommend this product parents new babies , it really meant very small children - just make sure they don't try pull up it	1
i bought this my 3 daughters they absolutely love it . rod actually casts bobber bait so i don't cast them . i no longer take hook out my pant legs . because it shoots bobber/bait straight out you them fish close bushes such where they would not normally able cast . i think this winner anything keeps my kids happy content while spending time me great product my book	1

ultimate challenge spatial relations try out this game . it like three dimensional tangram it really tough . great time bring this party work solutions group . personally , i think 8 years old probably little young this game . i'd suggest 12+ unless children teamed up adult	1
i really like this toy my daughter too . however , when i unpacked it , it reeked ( continues so ) high heaven sickly sweet baby powder smell . i guess babies ' supposed ' smell like makers this product . so , besides , it great . but , if you any sensitivity ultra strong stinky smells , better not get it . i would encourage manufacturer this doll drop baby powder smell	1
if you looking great value , get this engine . it so cute - it lights up makes chugging sound when it rolling track . we attach it battery-operated engine it makes sounds while other engine provides power . it just hours fun adds extra " something " your train	1

we received our blaster promptly enjoyed it fun way play marshmallows . it works well shoots marshmallows far . it provides good laugh my kids enjoy playing it .	1
i bought one marshmallow shooters , same company not too long ago . it best 20 dollars i've ever spent . acctually , i ended up ordering one my dad , one my 21 year old brother , one sixty something year old guy i work . we even took marshmallow guns my video camera out shot pretty good movie them . my review exact opposite other person who commented shooter . ( they detailed cleaning directions because young children don't know marshmallows melt inside gun hot sun , thus big mess gun . ) house not home out marshmallow gun . i'm purchase my 5th one , i can'wait marshmallow bow arrow	1
excellent kids adults well . we hada great time playing same . see who could get best highest score . what great you just plug same your vcr or tv inputs . i am goingto order several more . it much fun . iam 63years age enjoyed same	1
includes pole position , xevious , rally , bosconian , galaga , mappy . plus , naturally , ms pac man . this much better rendition than other ms pacman stick twitchy controller . left right movement doesn't seem much issue now . really great thing it saves your high scores name , you erase them all later if you wish clear memory . almost all games tweaked better than other joystick version just look , sound , play little better . control pole position twisting knob like steering wheel . variable adjustment made accurate game play . bosconian some vocals not included other version . wireless feature cool doesn't seem cause response lag . though , you want make sure you stay within line-of-sight while playing . joystick layout much more arcade-like simulated wood grain nice nostalgic touch . problem these games they still not 100% accurate arcade translations . part problem tv screens aren't sharp arcade monitors , nor same aspect ratio . many arcade monitors conventional tubes turned side . it comes close enough keep you practice enjoy golden era arcade games . well worth extra money batteries . forget other ms pac man joystick . short , not perfect , just better	1
this lovely little collection my little pony collection toys . if your children want create princess promenade then these breezies ( small winged ponys ) part . there two different sets you get . anyway , they really lovely toys my children weeks weeks fun them . whole thing , carriages breezies incredibly tough ( really surprising ! ) so they lasted some pretty hard knocks , they brightly coloured little wings back , while getting crinkled up packaging , firmly attached haven't removed . little antenna come off some tugging , but easy reattach . they overall really nice toy , they versatile , small pretty .	1
my 14-month-old twins love stacking knocking down these blocks . they so colorful fun	1

i bought this set memories family games around dinner table dancing through my head . my best buddy chris his family this card game when we kids , we played it lot . it great fun . however , one things i remember most nicely designed cards , suits depicting each commodity . old days suits rice , corn , wheat , flax , barley , etc . when i opened package i received amazon , i found " new improved " cards new commodities new graphic design . commodities now cocoa , platinum , gold , cattle , oil , rice , silver , gas . my opinion , these " improved " commodities far inferior classics . worst offense however graphic design . it quite awful . game course play same , but i say i am quite disappointed cards themselves . amazon photo depicts classic commodities , albeit different ( crappier ) design , but least that something . if you decide order this fun game , sure specify you don't want " new suits , " request old ones instead	1
description this product very enticing . but when you open box disappointment starts spirals out control . this very poorly made kit all respects . materials used , quality pieces , manner which they fit together all huge disappointment . not waste your money . save yourself seeing your child crestfallen face . i wish i taken time return it	-1
this very cute baby cute clothes , although her slippers came off quite easily . i also thought i buying doll bottle , but it sippy cup instead . anyway , child i gave it seemed happy , but we kept finding her slippers floor	1
pictures provided tanya . moynihan this doll wrong . her pictures not rock-a-bye baby chou chou , i must admit , i relied somewhat them when deciding purchase two dolls my 2 3 year olds . unfortunate . any case , i am not wild this baby doll . i don't care little button its mouth pressed make " sucking " sounds - it seems cheesy - i am not overly impressed construction or physical features baby chou chou . i think there must far cuter baby dolls out there ; i just haven't looked hard enough . also , its repertoire " coos " " babbles " somewhat limited , which quite annoying after very short time . my girls expressed great initial interest their chou chous , then threw them toy bin where they now cooing quietly beneath rest their unused toys ! i think i would more research ( person ) see what out there i known more accurately what this doll looked like . tanya , please remove your pictures - they misleading !	1
i am very pleased this food . it very realistic looking size . definitely recommended	1
just described ; good price , too . arrived quickly . very satisfied	1
commercials make moon sand look like it stays together well not messy all . it basically like letting your kid play sand inside . it mold together if you squeeze it or put it mold but not keep it making huge mess . if i could get rid it without my child getting upset i would	-1
i purchased this my son birthday somewhat hesitantly . product pretty cool itself ; it stick together pretty well . after using mold getting it out it holds it shape enough you pick it up play it few minutes . it doesn't seem stain anything , thankfully . only things i think someone should aware packaging/storing it , playmat , mess . 1 ) after you open it there not great way store it all together . there might kit something but not this one . 2 ) mat not very big it folded like map so you really smooth it out before play . it also slides around table bit doesn't actually contain sand one spot . 3 ) it sand it spreads . my biggest concern this there cautions saying not touch your eyes , not eat it , wash your hands afterwards . it made me little concerned if i didn't get every last speck cleaned up off table someone would get sick . overall it worth purchase -- better than floam	1
i bought this game my daughter 4th birthday because she keeps beating me regular memory games . she challenged loves this game ! i only put 10-15 objects time bowl her keep adding challenge her keep her interested . i also use this my work occupational therapist variety uses : sensory , pinch grasp small objects , memory game teach people how create categories objects help them remember list objects just few examples . i used it all age groups gotten positive feedback all . my sister i play ( without kids ) laughed lot we watch each other struggle ... window other players watch through ingenious . this excellent game adapted so many ways .	1

this great strategy game . object game capture your opponent flag using your military . strategy based where you hide your flag how you arrange your various pieces . warning : if you played this when you kid , beware ! new version reversed values all pieces . most powerful piece used " 1 " ; now it " 10 " . scouts , which " 9 " now " 1 " . miners , which defuse bombs " 2 " instead " 8 " . this important if you thinking buying old version game , because you confuse living daylights out your kids , who used new numbering scheme . bottom line this great game . downsides it only two people , you need put stickers pieces identification . old days , information stamped plastic ( or very old games , wood ) . there many key points remember when playing : protect your miners . your opponent probably surround flag bombs . also , not go trekking your opponents area your " 10 " without scouts or you could run into bomb or spy . also , remember where everything keep some miners scouts , among your strongest pieces near your flag . now , enjoy	1

ok . i admit it . i am truly addict , many my friends too . while , i monthly games night group my twenty-something girlfriends . this one game we play every single time ! premise simple : green cards adjectives printed them red cards nouns . you show green apple card table all players except judge choose what they feel " best-fitting " red apple card their hand . players then place their red apple card face-down table . judge shuffles cards chooses their favorite , owner red apple card wins green apple card round . everyone takes turns judge , once player won set number green apple cards , they win ! best features game how bizarre funny some cards how creative funny you interpretation juxtaposition adjectives nouns ! example : green card " jealous " red apple cards played " eleanor roosevelt , " " giant squid , " " jfk assasination , " " cauliflower . " which one would you choose , why ? this game , it fun judge equally fun compete . it worth noting although decision judge final , some players try sway judge choice . i've seen heated arguments break out during this game , it common practice play card you feel judge most likely choose ( " playing judge " ) . there also strategic thought required when keep card when make " card dump " getting rid difficult cards you don't see much potential . this game most fun 4 players or more , but you need least 3 play .	1
