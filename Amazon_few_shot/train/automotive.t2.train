these great blades , installation very straight forward . only gripe i these blades contact blade windshield extreme right where it ceases touch my windshield which 1/2 " , but odd thing tip touch my windshield up stroke . but it so minor it would not affect rating all since these blades fit onto so many different cars . i guess there no replacement factory blades	1

though i still encounter products not worth time laugh , i noticed more more products coming market actually meet sometimes beat expectations . well , mr. clean autodry met expectations , though it couple flaws . i've owned this product since it first hit store shelves , after very hyped up television marketing deal ... i figured if i bought it target it not work my satisfaction , target give me my money back . i tried it , it worked perfectlly . i knew prior experience de-ionised water not leave spots it ions molecules water left behind when water molecules evaporate . remove those ions there nothing left behind . i little sceptical such small filter would work well , however , but most part , it worked acceptably , but unit some flaws , i should list them ... flaw 1 ) soap filler cap badly designed . if there any soap left unit when you store it , you sure store it so cap upright ( it units side , not top ) , else you find puddle congealed , semi-dry soap when you pull it off shelf week later ! there no work around this except remember store unit upright , or lay other side . flaw 2 ) lack trigger flow control . unit uses very peculiar flip switch which little difficult flip off easily . it not terrible , but trigger like garden sprayer would so much better ! flaw 3 ) hose connector not turn freely ... you walk around car , hose twists water pressure tries twist it back ... this might limited unit i purchased , but either way , it quite annoying . i found perfect work around this , though it cost me few extra dollars . i bought hose quick disconnect spins quite freely . it little expensive ($6 , but works better than any other i ever tried , i simple screwed one end onto autodry other onto hose , got some extra sprayer connectors ($4 each ) other spray heads i use , it all good . other than above three flaws , i am quite pleased this product , use it routinely . i wash my car 30 minutes , i am quite particular ... here procedure i follow : 1 ) i quickly rinse down whole car get any dirt wet . 2 ) i then spray section car , usually starting roof , soap3 ) using super soft , laundered wool wash mitt , i gently " scrub " soaped area , quickly rinse unfiltered water , ensure entire car remains wet . 4 ) repeat steps 2 3 other parts car ( i.e. hood , trunk , sides , etc . ) , 5 ) using filtered water , starting high points car ( i.e. roof ) working down sills , i completely rinse off whole car then let it dry , sun or shade . i've never any spots whatsoever , except when filter turns brown ( which indicates filter exhausted )	1

i installed this item my 2001 dodge truck shortly after i purchased my truck nov . 2000 . i not any problems unit all . my key fob worn out , though it seen some abuse . i installed unit myself using their instructions . install take longer than i anticipated , but mostly because it sometimes took bit find correct wire truck . all , it great features fair price	1
this unit exactly what it says . reads codes allows you reset check engine light . it also software intrepret codes , but this very basic nature you find same info internet or some car mnufacturers . unit very well built easy operate .	1
there more expensive units out there they might appropriate you if you need more information . but this one perfect what i need . i " check engine " lights both my 2000 accord 2005 camry . i wanted find out what problems so i could decide if it something needed immediate attention find out if it something i could fix myself . it found problems both cars within couple minutes reset errors . honda " proprietary " error so i installed database software ( extremely easy install ) looked it up ( extremely easy use ) . turns out both cars non-critical problems i could just reset errors . this would cost me $150 my car maintenance shop . this device also functions pollution control system diagnostic tool . i haven't tried yet but it interesting see how works . i would highly recommend this " casual " user . pros would probably need something more stuff , but this extremely useful shade-tree mechanics	1

i'm little surprised bad reviews . i used mine years though i wear one out after 80 uses airing up four large truck tires 12 psi 35 psi through 150psi , 2.5 gal tank . i it hard-mounted my jeep . it pressurizes air tank which connected chucks both ends jeep . i start compressor near end trail time we stop air tank full pressure . then i connect hose one air chucks start airing up tires . compressor runs into tank tank feeds hose . i usually air one tire up 30 seconds this way . compressor doesn't catch up this makes it much easier work - everything up out way all i manage hose . tires i stop talk let compressor fill tank again . or i air up next tire . this unit not last forever not like handled roughly . i only handled plug once - plug it when i bolted it jeep permanently . so i don't plug problems . it noisy but it sound you want hear when you need air . i remember one night helping friend who flat . they very grateful hear sound see their tire come back life . if you want industrial strength unit , you going spend several hundred dollars . this unit keeps up well arb compressor costs four times much . treat it well it treat you well	1
this unit works surprisingly well following caveats : 1 . you must replace cheap cig lighter plug aligator style clips designed hooked directly your battery . cheap connector becomes hot point melting . this due high current demand placed battery . your mechanic or local car electroncs store should able this you . also , it take approx 5 min inflate your tire . it bit slow . 2 . you should run your car engine so battery doesnt run down . product built fan seems keep unit cooler while running . i liked it what it	1

i probably went through 5 different " suction cup " mounted compasses none them worked properly . there too many magnetic fields vehicle them work properly without calibration . this compass however worked great within 5 minutes . installation easy enough , once it mounted all you need hold button down 5 seconds put compass " calibration " mode , then drive around circles slowly until it stops flashing . granted , you look like idiot driving circle parking lot somewhere , but once you compass works just like one you would find factory installed . only complaints actual sensor feels kinda cheap it came apart slightly when i mounting it . it just snapped back together though . also , back light just stays 3 seconds . i'd rather it stay 10 , but you need think how long it really takes you read two letters ? if you actually want compass your car it didn't come one , this only one i've found actually works . so just buy it . :	1
this multimeter all around good tool . it all features you need plus some features only more expensive ones . like battery tester backlight display . i am studying electronics right now i find myself getting ton more use out it than i thought i would . it easy use instruction manual comes it tells you how perform most common tests it pictures go . there comperable multi-meters out there cost less but most would cost more . there certainly better multi-meters than this one but they cost more . only bad things i say this tool battery hard get . you remove 2 screws back pry it apart . actron should just put one those slide off battery covers it . also most multi-meters come some sort rubber , protective sleeve , also lanyard your hand so you dont drop it . if this mult-meter lanyard battery easier get out , i would given it 5 stars .	1

after reading numerous raving reviews here amazon.com several other sites , learning auto clay safe clear coat paints because it works through non-abrasive process , i decided give it try -- boy , i glad i ! my car covered stubborn deposit dirt grime simply would not come off car wash . it seemed dirt grime gotten lodged paint wouldn't budge no matter how hard i tried washing car . after every car wash , i would run my fingers through paint it would still feel gritty . when i learned mothers 07240 california gold clay bar paint saving system kit . results astounding ! after using it , paint no longer felt gritty but glassy-smooth . paint no longer dulled contaminants car looked like it new coat paint ! i immensely pleased results . unlike lot car polish or polishing compounds use abrasion strip away surface contaminants , auto clay simply picks up surface contaminants locks them into clay . clay looks feels exactly like plasticine ( play-doh�) it used included " lubricant " spray ( actually , auto soap provide lots suds -- like meguiar gold class -- work equally well . ) mind you , car polish still its place paint restoration because claying not remove scratches ; only car polish or polishing compound ( harsher ) . remember , always follow claying application wax shield your paint new contaminants . also , clay your car every so often you keep paint looking like new ! i am giving mothers 07240 california gold clay bar paint saving system kit my highest recommendation . go , try it see yourself firsthand difference it makes your car paint . it worth every penny i'm sure you'll glad you !	1
