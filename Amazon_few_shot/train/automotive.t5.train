i bought this product whim . i looking carwash detergent safeway , mr. clean autodry sale . curious , i gave it try . first all , this unit wastes lot water . after washing rinsing , you apply filtered water all over car distance one feet . it feels like spray painting . then you wait water evaporate . problem , i live san franisco , ca -- nothing dries this climate without help . if i hadn't hand dried my car , i'd still waiting water evaporate . odd thing -- hand drying actually seemed more difficult after using mr. clean soap unit . it though it left residue . i'm not sure what it . but i'll probably end up washing my car again tomorrow , old-fashioned way ..	-1
ok it so obviously obstructing view your license plate . i thought it would only blur it high distant angles cameras but it blurs it almost every angle besides directly behind it ( even then edges blurry ) . check laws your local state . i'm pretty sure this thing very illegal !!! i trash mine . thanks taking my money	-1

i same problem described . nielsen . gauge would not take new reading after i pressed release valve let air out . it only took new reading if it removed tire completely reconnected . i called manufacturer , who told me it sounded like problem i should return gauge them replacement . i returned it amazon defective got new one same problem . i contacted manufacturer again they again asked me send gauge replacement . i sent gauge manufacturer my expense . second replacement also problem . customer service told me they sent second replacement wrong batch/crate . six weeks later ( november 27th ) i received properly functioning gauge . so it seems properly manufactured example this gauge really work properly . there just very large run defective ones . this point , i would give this item 3 stars : 4 performance price , minus one hassle involved getting one isn't defective . if yours defective , you should contact accutire customer service let them know : 973-402-4240 .	-1

we bought this scratch remover years ago auto store . it wasn't expensive but totally useless . we put it scratch or two our car which black what it said . it nothing except leave white stain area i applied it . i tried everything get it off , then i use my last option rubbing compound . luckily rubbing compound got stain off . after this i dumped tube our basement lost track it since then ( probably dumped it ) . shortly after we went auto store again we found auto paint . they come little tube paint brush each paint code ( got get one your model car ) . used it worked well years later still looks good . up close you still see scratch there but only really up close . after i waxed area after paint dried it looked fine . unless you look it you not see scratch . so don't buy this product either buy auto paint or take your car auto body shop . this product would better door stop even then it would probably poor job .	-1

you trust this item works well not scratch your paint . i always skeptical previously just asssumed these things scratched car . but my paintless dent removal guy uses one highly recommended california duster me . he fanatical keeping his car totally detailed . this product works so well he never even washes his car unless it gets rained . he just dusts it every morning before he backs out his garage , if needed he uses some liquid instant detailer microfiber cloth after dusting if he feels like it . it takes total less than 2 minutes dust off entire car , yet result makes your car look like you just washed it . i use california duster before putting my car cover so there no dust car car cover . if you garage , it quite useful since dust settles car during day when you out night , even garaged . you won't wash your car often if you use california duster . dust won't build up if you use it often enough . before discovering california duster , i found after washing my car , i could only use my car cover few days before car got too dusty put cover over . now i find i keep car dust free use car cover much longer , which turn means i don't wash car nearly often . i got plastic handle california duster which significantly cheaper time i ordered . although wood handle one looks classier probably feels nicer , plastic handle one feels plenty sturdy , value oriented , get plastic handle one since it exact same brush anyway ! i am really very happy what i paid calfornia duster would not hesitate recommend one anyone car or motorcycle . just aware what it not made car wet or very dirty . my only complaint it not actually made calfornia	1

first all ' 11 cubic feet ' means little me so if you wondering dimesions this bag , look no further ( because nor even lund web site you could find this valuable information ) . dimensions labeled box 44 " x36 " x16 " ( , , ) . so far i stuffed it six letter size stackable white cardboard boxes like those you find office depot ( 15.5 " 12.5 " x11 " ) intended your backlog ( willamette ) , it not easy first glance but , believe it or not , there enough room them . te curb aerodinamic shape ends some 18 " front side back reach 16 " claimed . me it seems like parabolic shape because height continues increase slightly up around 18 " backside . my 6 backlog boxes place there still some 26 " x36 " x5 " room above them . material seems strong , only think i don't like zipper wich seems regular one not one intended support strong wind force . well , two weeks i'll tell you what happened this bag during my 600 mile trip . so far , so good	1

i bought one these when they first came out , because we very hard water i hate shammying my car . soap doesn't foam up like it would if you bucket-washing , but it gets car just clean . i sort like it doesn't trigger device , it avoids accidentally spraying vehicle when you don't want . plus you don't wash your car bucket full dirty water . super-fast jet spray setting not useful me , but i'm sure you off-roaders would appreciate it . i don't agree reviewer who said it causes more water spots . i don't think they used it right . if you wash your car pretty often , this kit comes recommended	1
after reading review max i just let others know this product realy work great . it also saves me time . max problem may his whole process flawed i never read directions may how product tells you it , however all i simple . wet car ( my case truck ) down regular water then wash car , truck top down i use microfiber towel towel one hand mrclean autowash other . i wash soap rinse i go around car , truck . when it all washed down re-rinse regular water top down , change filtered water rinse again top down . i this part rather quickley it sprays just like spray paint gun . then just let it sit dry . reason i only give product 4 stars . seal cap soap compartment leakes storage if you dont prop it up just right or lay it its side . they really needed trigger water controll , off . i used this all last summer im sure i washed my truck least 20 times . my water filter still worked fine . it may my process how fast i get around truck or i may cleaner water then what they say only 10 washes per filter . i am back here get new one , beacuse i kept it outside well i cant expect it hold up hard freeze i ? heh	-1

i bought this product list price local auto store . expensive ( amazon much cheaper ) , sure , but it goes pretty thin , so bottle should last while . it really easy put remove . i used cotton applicator put wax over . it hazed over immediately just little pressure needed get wax car . i didn't rub hard or anything . i waited just minute ( probably not even necessary wait long ) buffed off good microfiber towel ( vroom stuff target worked great ) . i really shouldn't say " buffed " , because i didn't press all hard -- wax came off light moderate pressure . i found this quite bit easier apply than meg nxt wax . wax looks great . it deeper look it than most pure synthetics , but also some good shine it . my car darker color it added some depth it . i applied it my friend black car , it looked pretty wet . it some cleaners it , so it removed whatever fillers i my last wax exposed swirls little more . if you bothered your car swirls , you might want consider carnauba wax , it mask them better than this one . i've it my car 2 months now water still beading nicely . i doubt it last much longer , but i think 2 months not bad half-synthetic wax like this one . this top-of-the-line best-ever wax ? no , but it look great , it easy apply . so i recommend it all my friends who hate spending lot time waxing their car	1

this unit even better than i expected . i read reviews those who used it decided it better bd also available . little pricier , but many features , it makes it worth all-in-one package . i surprised it dc plugs ( things you usually plug into lighter ) . mostly i looking a/c plugs , jump-starting capability ( road trips , camping , etc . ) . great deal , especially amazon automotive promotion $20 off $100 .	1
seems amazon doesn't want sell this item because they don't tell most important thing it , it 0 - 60 psi gauge used tires needing 30 psi , give or take 10 . illustration incorrect , but they show same picture all different moroso gauges . i measured accuracy against digital it within . 5 psi . best thing it makes perfect instant seal tire . put little extra air , press button it accurate fill . i think rubber cover must . amazon best price	1
finally got try this item out when my wife i some bar hopping couple weeks ago . we delayed our drive home until device gave us all clear . course big question whether readings accurate without calibrated reference device hand , this currently remains unanswered . indirect evidence ( our known consumption rate , body weight , subjective feelings ) suggested device ballpark . since i access more accurate ( far more expensive ) tester work , i may attempt some experiments report back findings here . device very easy carry around quite unobtrusive . glancing it , one would assume it just keyless entry . it definitely good price point . since these type devices great aid responsible drinker alcohol , it would likely benefit society large if their use became common . it should remembered , however , one still cited most places while driving when bac above zero even if levels don't reach most serious dwi/dui standards so designated driver still remains best option .	-1
this best !!! best store , best service , fast service , great packageing . i shop there again recomend it everyone !	1

i just got this myself it works like charm . installation took atbout 1/2 hour it works just like it advertises . i couple things . i agree need place solar cell within couple inches garage door light . i sears craftsman flourescent bulb which enough solar cell right above light . there pressure stick pad holds solar cell onto garage door opener . there black 3-4 foot wire ( looks like rca audio wire plug ) connects solar cell laser beam generator which maybe 3/4 " long 3/8s inch wide . it too stick adhesive glued onto your garage ceiling . laser pivots easily so it aimed . actual beam emits pulsing red dot not bigger than 1/8 " wide onto your dashboard when you drive under it . it takes little getting used first know what look when you're parking . my garage ceiling 2 feet above roof car so it pretty close laser generator . if you higher ceiling , mounting probably harder but dot maybe slightly bigger . one thing i adjust my wife shorter than me so she sees beam alittle later than i sit up bit seat see it dashboard our toyota sienna which little flat . i need re-aim laser easier spot point her since this her parking slot . works like charm - just wish dot little bigger make it easier spot when you pull . great feature not any batteries or plug ins required	1

i used this haul 75-pound , 74-inch-long flat-pack furniture box 100 miles top 1994 toyota camry , it worked just fine . i my doubts when i bought it . i lost upholstered chair washington , dc beltway once -- tied it down rope it took off like kite . but this highland carrier job . when putting it together , save yourself some aggravation loop straps through plastic bases before you attach bases crossbars ( instructions tell you reverse , which makes threading next impossible ) . pieces attached firmly roof my camry , flat metal hooks going sills open doors . once doors closed there no way hooks come out . make sure straps tight before you close doors . this little tricky there seemed some slippage through buckles , but little tugging wiggling they snugged up pretty well . note rubber feet fit plastic bases provide grip protect your roof when carrier , but they fall off easily when it not use . i don't know why they weren't permenently attached . maximum recommended load 150 pounds but i didn't test it limit -- crossbars look sturdy but they're hollow metal tubes , they bounced little under weight box . also , bars textured finish but seemed little slippery , so i wrapped some gritty no-slip tape around them ( kind used stairsteps ) prevent any slippage . i attached box carrier two ratchet tie-downs ( highly recommended over rope ) . tie-down straps looped once around box under each crossbar box didn't budge whole trip home . one other thing , make sure tie up any dangling straps -- sound them whacking against roof your car very disconcerting . inexpensive solution that good temporary use light loads short trips cars don't roof racks . update : used carrier haul two same box camry , bringing load right up 150-lb maximum -- rock solid all way . i laid long boxes side-by-side longest width down spread out weight much possible , then duc t-t aped them together fastened them down good tight tie-downs rope ( overkill ? perhaps , but better safe than sorry sued . ) my next car probably small suv , but until then i'm glad i this carrier . inexpensive , easy use remove job	-1

nutshell : what you when it raining your tire goes flat wal-mart parking lot ? this happened me today i scared out my wits . i hour get home before my six-year-old son got off school bus . i 25 miles away i just saw my rear tire knew it no air it . i recalled using this product 6 years ago it worked , so i ran into wal-mart skipped items i come shopping went straight automotive section hunt this stuff . twenty minutes later , standing parking lot , i read directions realized i try find what leaking remove it if possible . after breaking small screwdriver bending key car we sold 5 years ago , i managed remove nail 4 inches long -- trouble rest air leaked out rather quickly once i pulled out nail . read follow directions ! directions stated valve stem 8 o'clock position so i my teenage daughter back car up until valve stem 8 o'clock position . i shook over 30 seconds angela timed me , then i screwed hose attachment into valve stem . it whooshed stream white , foamy liquid rushed through transparent tubing into tire . i could hear air rushing it but then i recalled what actually happened last time i used this stuff 6 years ago . you guessed it , hole towards top tire foam never got there allowing air simply escape very nosily out hole . since flat rear my front-drive plymouth voyager minivan , i drove it gas station i knew air , 6 miles away . i went 25 mph many people hailed me they drove alongside inform me i flat tire . but then something good happenedby time i reached chevron station air , still some 20 miles our home , i convinced i turned flat tire into spaghetti we would miss bus . well , i am happy report this not case . traveling slowly , tire circulated white sealant foam heated up some due extra friction caused running without air . i filled tire up my surprise there no sound escaping air . sealant held i drove , somewhat reduced speed , remaining 18-20 miles 38 minutes get home 2 minutes ahead bus . bottom line : air source nearby if you pull out nailthis stuff work , but after you pull out nail your tire it may rather difficult get it hold air before it circulate heat up within tire . this my actual experience this exact product today , it consistent what happened 6 years ago . short , air supply lined-up when you insert sealant close possible where you remove nail insert sealant . this reduce risk running tire flat rendering it unserviceable . if you this , you stand excellent chance executing fast emergency repair anybody manage , like me , you too might save day .
