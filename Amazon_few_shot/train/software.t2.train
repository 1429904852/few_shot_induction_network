i assumed , incorrectly , adobe customer service would professional quick . i called three times past two weeks wait , minimum , 23 minutes just speak someone . when i finally got my product , they sent mac verion rather than pc version i purchased . i called again waited approximately 30 minutes get customer help . i originally ordered pc standard version asked upgrade ( pay difference ) professional version -- since i still hadn't received pc version . customer service stated they would only ship me standard version replace incorrectly shipped mac version then i would wait standard verison arrive which point i could call again , ask exchange professional verion - insane !!! adobe call center easily worst customer service i dealt -- i've dealt some bad customer service	-1
only redeeming quality this gps system it cheap . i used it 1,000 mile trip east coast week after i got it . navigation poor . i found i often look over laptop screen because i " off route " so often due poor maps . system repeated same annoying problems i see other feedback . 1 ) unit would show me off road even though i interstate . this case it would continually recalculate route diretc me take exits get off highway circle around . 2 ) it directed me make turns onto one-way streets wrong direction . 3 ) it could not locate poi turned out few hundred yards away 4 ) it often not know correct side road my destination 5 ) it doesn't provide chime when it time turn . it tell you turn half-mile ahead , but might last time you hear instruction . 6 ) one case , it got me my destination ( least close enough ) but couldn't guide me back my starting poin t.t he gps receiver seemed acquire hold satellite signal well . but maps poor , verbal instruction - it sounds like 1980 computer generated voice . if you're looking trustworthy guide unfamiliar areas - this isn't i t.t his going back asap .	-1

i've owned this software since it ridiculously overpriced $500 1.0 inception . even it latest 1.5.1 $299 version apple should still ashamed themselves . i use final cut studio own 3 recent macs , so i've devoted apple say least . i am professional wedding photographer/videographer . i more than patient this software . it looks great , up apple standards design vision but remains absolutely plagued bugs . unless you pay apple laughable amounts money ( much more than cost software itself ! ) , they not provide support anything except installation ... even if there software update source issue . someone who such apple fan , i feel obligated let everyone know unless you enjoy pulling your hair out repeating tasks over over again yourself favor download lightroom adobe .	-1

first all , many samples i viewed browsing this software same object just turned different angles . there far fewer images than number touted . this scam my opinion , but situation i could live . but major issue most photo images i searched my actual use very poor , actually totally unusable resolution . they corrupted clarity , poor pixel quality , distorted , unsuitable except perhaps , third grader school project . it complete waste money . it headed first garage sale i hold , i offer it 50 cents non-return policy .	-1
this program not allow you switch elevation view or alter framing details . i'm only using it simple garage i expected able generate simple working plans basic demensions . not so . you might well pick up copy sims so you could least some fun it . if you want get rough ideas this might you but if you actually want work it , forget it . very disappointing waste money	-1

first all , microsoft needs come down their prices ( not this ever happen ) . i build computers living , i'd say 9 times out 10 windows single most expensive piece any pc i build . said , xp come long way . service pack 2 wonders security . i also found it most stable version windows i've used date . that not say it doesn't it flaws . it still lets it share " germs " , stops responding time time ( hangs ) , it very slow shut down . built-in cd writing software terrible remote desktop not always pleasure use either . however , biggest problem i've so far product activation . pc technician , i'm always testing new parts . most annoying problem i've after you make certain number hardware changes ( let say you replace video card , hard drive add some memory ) all within certain period time ( 180 days maybe ? ) windows makes you reactivate . this becomes problem when you reactivate twice within this period time . it makes you call microsoft , where you convince representitive you're not trying steal them . then you read them long number ( i think 41 digits ) then they'll read long number back you you need type . it driven me point using windows 2000 again test my parts , even though this isn't always practical testing xp compatibility . overall , i feel i paid too much this operating system .	1
i recently purchased software above only find it not support my dvd drive ( hl-dt-st rw/dvd gcc-4482b ( 1.00 )i unsuccessfully tried contact roxio support three times . no response . i go through long list supported drives also emailed my problem roxio . needless say , i am very disappointed not recommend purchase this software . i new gateway desktop came above drive .	-1
this roxio software caused me most bizarre frustrating experience ever . first , it doesn't work . second , i cannot obtain any support roxio find out why . they won't give support until you register , only way register follow web link comes software , it takes you website either doesn't exist , or always down . thus , it turns out complete waste money , not mention several hours time . run , don't walk away this software this company	-1

acrobat 5 so buggy i thought i'd give adobe couple product cycles before upgrading . should waited longer . there improvements v7 : better look , better commenting , ability add text actually prints , far better ocr functionality . but other basic functions way worse than v5 : some word documents easy convert pdf v5 not convert v7 , seems something font license issues . installation nightmare repeated re-installation required get past system hangs , clashes standard security software , endless errors automatic update feature . new product activation makes this even more pain because too many re-installations force you activate phone . despite my already low expectations adobe , this product disappointment . acrobat 7 , adobe , usual , charging top $ what any decent company would consider embarrassing mess even beta version . ( reference , my system window xp pro , pentium 4 3ghz , 2.5 gb ram )	1
office 97 pretty good product . programs powerful , decent interface ( maybe not good claris products early 1990s , but not bad ) , came ton features all one disc . office 98 release mac pretty much same thing . only thing really got annoying me office assistant ( paperclip ) but it easy enough turn off . office 2000 bit disappointment me . i felt improvements minimal ( aside bit more stability word -- anyone who ever used word 97 regular basis knows it prone crashing ) fact detracted ease use . one example clip gallery , which went one best organizers ever created becoming program wouldn't received decent reviews 1988 . powerpoint outline feature . i always turned this off because it ate up monitor space therefore made actual slide smaller . when you use smaller displays like i often this problem . menus , which hide some functions until you go bottom them , also annoyance . manual went nice thick book one half size . office 2003 continues making program uglier . now there many tasks crammed onto one little panel right screen . again , this eats into workspace . clip art system even more cumbersome , many clips online only now . help feature tries point too much online direction well . now some people may not complain , but what if you're using laptop middle country ? i feel program basically uglier version same thing first seen 1997 . fact , 1997 version more pleasant work almost powerful . my macs , i've switched keynote presentations pages some my word processing because new office versions platform similar . some templates also look very 1997 . apple programs updated regular basis , their templates look very modern . now i know microsoft adds some new ones now then , but they should consider redesigning many them -- such replacing overused arial times new roman fonts something little more classy . program bloated way too heavily . i run office 2000 comfortably 486 sub-1gb hard drive , but can't even get 2003 it . final gripe access not user friendly all . file maker better alternative , it easier use friendlier	-1
while microsoft tries very hard make office " think ahead me , " they almost always seem get it wrong . result package consistently annoys me . it true one turn off " helpful " hints otherwise customize programs so they less hindering , however bloated package nevertheless usurp your computers resources like nobody business . my opinion , office ' 97 excellent package , versions since then gone steadily downhill . many people , i use office work because i no choice . home i've good luck staroffice sun . while not perfect , staroffice read created files compatible microsoft office very consistently my experience , it whole lot less expensive . i am therefore hesitant recommend microsoft office professional edtition 2003 anyone except those who need most advanced functions excel and/or need use access database frequently .	1

let me sum up this software " total junk " pinnacle give you one free support phone call help , then $25 next call . they give you free email support , but answer everything but your problem . they try blame it windows xp , you reload windows . i owned studio 8 , it worked fine . went studio 9 , few problems . upgraded studio 9 plus , after week trying make it render my projects no sucess , crash after crash , i removed it my machine . they sent me offer their all new 10.5 plus upgrade , hollywood fx , 3 their premium packs , hat says studio 10 it . this said program rebuilt bottom up . this program should called " crash after crash " , only thing works hat . if you feel urge waste $100 , hours your time , just buy this product . look reviews studio 10 , other studio products , most only one star . out over 100 reviews over 95% one star . i found one 5 stars , but looking reviewers other reviews he obviously employee , or share holder company . he wrote 1 star review sony competative product , 5 star reviews other pinnacle products you would not own if 10.5 worked	-1
i owned eleven vcom products now , they don't my business . product touts itself part vital tool when/if your machine crashes . if it , prepared shell out cost complete program . you told program already installed machine you can't run it-although this occurs after lengthy cumbersome installation process . sadly , customer assistance no help-emails unanswered you can't get through via phone ... what you get them once you register constant emails new products . thanks , folks . version 6.0 also much slower than version 5 . support 5.0 , way stopped abruptly when new edition came out , despite functionality program . price , software should work like major player , rather than dollar bin special .	-1

i don't problem software . it pretty much what we need but reversing error nightmare . before i start this tirade , i should point out customer service reps very nice . but they don't infrastructure provide most basic level service ( please , read ) . customer support system payroll upgrade this product really scary . ( 1 ) they want access your checking account pay annual payroll subscription !! ( 2 ) they not send receipts !! i help books small non-profit paid payroll subscription my own credit card . only receipt i could get copy invoice , which not formatted print correctly hp1200 ( duh !! ) . what really disturbing these people supposed accounting experts ! if you acquiesce checking account withdrawal , only receipt you receive line item your bank statement . they every heard " paper trail " . well you sure won't get one if you purchase payroll subscription this product . i start looking alternative intuit because they obviously don't understand some basic accounting auditing principles .	-1

i qualify this review saying i not own pm 8.0 , so i cannot fairly give rating , despite overwhelmingly negative reviews . i only relate personal experience norton/symantec products . i own used pm 6.0 since ' 01 when it still powerquest instead norton/symantec it worked very well , though gui bit quirky . i run it 2 drives , one 98se xp pro , pm loaded 98se partition it everything i needed both drives . trouble , version 5.0 , afaik , not compatible xp since m$ no longer supports 98se , we problem , houston . currently i am using mobile drive bay switch drives needed . if i get drive partitioning software product compatible xp , it most assuredly not anything produced norton/symantec , based these reviews personal experience norton/symantec products . i first bought computer ' 98 used norton antivirus 5.0 . time , norton probably best antivirus product out there . it worked flawlessly i used recommended it years . no more . i purchased copy symantec system works 2005 right after it released . long story short , i no longer use norton products because i got tired system crashes stability issues caused unstable bloatware system resource hog it become , am currently using competing product very highly rated but not common shelves big box stores . there one lone symantec product i still use --- windoctor , which not installed my ' puter but ran cd needed . adios , anything else produced norton/symantec . it ain't worth headaches when there much better products available less coin .	-1

don't take my word it that quote title recent post excoriating this irritating increasingly bloated product slashdot . warned : adobe not learned its lesson , despite outcry followed release version 6 , this latest release acrobat continues adobe aggressive trend intruding into your desktop environment , again , version 6 without providing easy way undo damage once its -- fact , it now nearly impossible . like earlier releases , this version acrobat adds startup macros new toolbar buttons your existing applications adds menu entries your desktop " right click " menus . adobe argues these conveniences , but they entirely unnecessary ( most us " printing " adobe pdf achieves same result , much more convenient , more natural model ) , clutter what most users either too-crowded user interface ( those who don't knowledge or patience customize it ) or carefully tuned one ( those who ) . unlike many well-behaved applications provide obvious ways avoiding this kind intrusive disruptive behavior ( e.g. through simple checkbox option settings dialog ) , acrobat " option " disabling this behavior , once deeply hidden setup process , now almost completely absent . disable " convert adobe pdf " button mysteriously appears outlook mail editor , example , one sure choose " this feature not available " " microsoft outlook " option under " acrobat pdfmaker " under " create adobe pdf " . simply deleting button using outlook toolbar customization feature not work : it comes right back when editor next opened . similar problems arise word , excel , visio , project , internet explorer . there simply no way get rid never-used " convert adobe pdf " " combine acrobat ... " entries appear desktop context menus files ( even if one installs none acrobat pdfmaker features ) . technically inclined wishing repair some damage acrobat 7 , there complex but largely effective step step instructions available web , but even authors these driven despair version 7 : ( " adobe really pushed boat out acrobat 7 managed screw word royally " ) . short , acrobat make mess your working environment , there no way completely fix it , even partial fix pain ( not well documented ) . ( this may seem minor issue , but if every application followed adobe reckless example , our working environments would start look like strip malls , crowded features screaming our attention point where it hard find what we need when we need it . one great strengths personal computer desktop users configure it ways suit their needs ; no application should interfere . ) experienced acrobat users also notice this version continues frustrating trend acrobat ( most other adobe applications ): it yet again slower launch than previous version . fact , my 2 ghz pentium 4 , it takes longer launch than entire visual studio . net development environment , longer than boot sequence windows xp ! there other minor problems well ( arbitrary rearrangements menu tool bar items , etc . ) but these two major flaws more than bad enough . unless you really need latest acrobat features , you should probably avoid this upgrade . if " improvements " this release any indication where adobe plans go future releases , it may time start looking elsewhere tool digital document management . fortunately , there no reason all upgrade . version 7 offers no usefully new features , so you ( should ) avoid this one ( all costs )	-1
effort boost their file numbers appear more comprehensive , creators included many very low resolution images they " artsied " or " roughed " up dirty polaroid-transfer effect , or split up into 5 small stagger-stacked slides , which they must hoped would excuse poor quality original image . example , if you search " tiger " , you get 165 results , but only 86 animal , ( not one 20 images 10 toy tigers , or 5 images one tiger-striped chair-cushion so ) , those 86 , 80 crusty effect applied them . other 6 tigers taken out those same 80 images clipped out their background give you floating tiger clump grass or tiger head ( but , thankfully , not " dirtied " up transfer effect ) . out all , there not one clean image tiger its environment . here example . search " sunset " yields 247 results . these , 163 crusty polaroid transfer effect applied , 70 same images duplicated ( much smaller ) sloppy stack 5 slides . there two clean sunset images . these typical results . numbers don't mean anything ! this product stuffed multiple images toys , frankly not-so-attractive people hard angles , old low-resolution stock photos achieve 150,000 files . would it killed them include one clean , print-resolution image each category ? perhaps we could without 50 fake slide images ( talk dated anyway ! ) order get product worth around	1
i thought this would good product my computer . i didn't know only way receive this product over internet via download . during process prompts internet download ask you remove ( uninstall/delete ) all your known antivirus , spyware , firewalls your computer prior install . this leaves your computer susceptible when you receive error message . i received error message prevented me completing download . i purchased software aug 3 called customer support , they researched problem even took remote access my computer try fix issue . they unable so then passed me second level computer technicans . microsoft guards its secrets well varying levels technical support , those know basics those know more . they asked me set up time span when i would like receive call " teir ii " agents , i chose 6-9pm . i received several calls over next two weeks , all them outside specified time . i missed several them because i career life . when i finally spoke agent they again took over remote access my computer also unable solve issue . here it , two weeks after i purchased software , i still not what i needed . i also unable surf web because download process requires you delete all antivirus firewall software . i called several times druing ordeal " teir i " agents just told me i wait call , " they'll get it when they get it .

microsoft office handy . files you open , edit create it ( most notably . doc , . xls , . ppt ) probably closest universal compatibility among all your high quality options . it ( relatively ) intuitive . it pretty broad array useful functions . it also obscenely expensive , considering fact you get all these things -- . doc , . xls , . ppt ; intuitive interface ; functionality -- free . i hunted up openoffice two years ago when i decided several hundred dollars insane price pay ability write papers , make basic presentations , or put together spreadsheets . i looking basic functionality , but i pleasantly surprised ; openoffice most neat tricks , too . ( actually , it neat trick microsoft never replicate : it open source , so it respond needs individual users . you just say " add this neat trick !

i owned eleven vcom products now , they don't my business . product touts itself part vital tool when/if your machine crashes . if it , prepared shell out cost complete program . you told program already installed machine you can't run it-although this occurs after lengthy cumbersome installation process . sadly , customer assistance no help-emails unanswered you can't get through via phone ... what you get them once you register constant emails new products . thanks , folks . version 6.0 also much slower than version 5 . support 5.0 , way stopped abruptly when new edition came out , despite functionality program . price , software should work like major player , rather than dollar bin special .	-1

used norton antivirus last 3 years . getting product tax software promotions . no problems until i installed 2007 6 days ago , when my system became really slow then i unable access internet . since their customer service phone number not user guide but buried their website , i thankful my husband laptop available . first rep became exasperated when his scripted suggestions not resolve my problem after 1.25 hours tersely told me he sending me email file would solve my problems . i identified it worm protection causing problem so i turned off , accessed file ran it . my computer updated twice no change - if worm protection , i wasn't going able access internet . worked up my patience called evening , only hold 48 minutes . finally got native india who spoke english worse than first guy . one point , we waiting restart i asked her question computer slower 2007 version she responded , " ok , yes " . long story short , i hung up hour later link update 2007 product which i assured would solve problem email address her manager . during these two calls , software uninstalled , reinstalled , tested i spent several hours using online support . i updated product it worked couple hours . then i right back where i began , unable access internet unless i turned off worm protection . i started day 360 days remaining my subscription but once i updated , protection center now says my subscription expired . when i check my norton account online , it shows i almost year remaining before expiration all their tips update proection center pathetically failed . sent email management address i given , but course , haven't heard anything . i am uninstalling this product never use norton again .	-1

positive pccillin it seems work okay . it scans email firewall works okay . negatives : - it supplies lot warning requests . this would good , but they aren't explained easily understood dialog so you end up answering yes permission requests without always knowing if that best choice . - even though it supplies 3 license keys program little buggy sometimes loses keys . if it loses keys it disables ability update or click customer service live chat button . process restoring key computer isn't too hard , but requires bit assistance customer support . - customer service slow . sometimes i've lucky gotten into support chat right away , but sometimes i've wait 40 minutes or more . support personnel don't seemed trained technicians , but just phone support people reading through manual canned answers . getting right answer take long time lot trial error . i used pccillin 2 years now . latest version definitely isn't good it previous versions . i wouldn't recommend this product	-1
i use turbotax every year i would e-file also . it says i e-file $16.95 it even says that all it cost one last windows . then right before it transmit it says $16.95 federal plus $16.95 state plus 2.5 percent what i owe some " third party " company , thats $25 each 1,000 you owe . if i'm paying some third company transmit my return than why am i paying turbotax it also ? so ok i'll print it out send it . it wants print out every worksheet statement total 53 pages . it no longer gives you option just print pages you need . i am now cornered into paying extra $90 efile or go through torture printing out 53 pages which i need only 5 or 6 . dirty trick . it makes total cost $130 . it would cheaper more efficent going good accountant . other than program worked even easier than ever before	-1
i used turbo tax past 3 years so this year like drone i purchased it amazon . great price way . well i receive product try load it find out july ' 06 it isn't compatible windows ' 98 . now i send it turbo tax refund . its great they doing but they should put something front box . after 45 minute call turbo tax they finally agreed credit me difference $20 purchase their online software . online software same exact program i purchased amazon but they charge $20 more ... go figure . it sounds fishy deceitful me . i never buy their software again !	-1

it time switch any product but symantec one : what once best security software company pc users now worst . it time upgrade my systemworks premier 2007 version , so i checked out ' 07 features online . but where password manager ? hell , i 187 passwords logins i depend upon password manager fill -- least 30 them day . after hour phone allegedly ' english-speaking ' symantec csr bombay , story i got customer surveys prompted them ' drop ' password manager . not stupid , i said , ' let me guess , symantec going roll out stand-alone password manager extort $40 me ' . ' oh , no , sir , no , no ...

others noted , this product prevents aol loading my machine - it just stalls ( aol using connection via cable ) . it also " automatically " registers itself symantec starts counting 1 year subscription unless you cut internet access . i removed it machine ( toshiba laptop ) installed it my backup dell ( older pentium 3 866mhz ) . both running xp latest updates . it slowed internet explorer crawl locked it up when i attempted first write this review . it also slowed overall performance , when not browser , though this seems illogical . i uninstalled it ( it only norton product machine ) it left live update installed until i manually started removal it . fortunately everything back normal after removing all . this truly dangerous software those least my type equipment : stay away unless you very poor browsing security machine not choke it	-1

i purchased standard edition x3 primarily 3 reasons : 1 ) it claims ability convert pdf files into wp format , 2 ) it claims able organize your e-mail files through use wp mail well beyond capabilities outlook express , 3 ) it claims enhanced use wp word processing . what i found product met only one out three its claims . baseball , batting . 333 put you into hall fame . business , fulfilling one three claims put you into bankruptcy ! while pdf converter rather good tool , wp3 mail unstable ( this their tech support department ) . it destabilizes your use e-mail point making it virtually unusable terms reliability . i imported older e-mail outlook express when i installed wp x3 software , only later find out system crashed regularly . i could not get my older imported e-mail , could not find practical way reverse importing back into outlook express . what really irked me their tech support worthless rectifying situation . they merely responded saying they aware problem " may " release patch help sometime future . ahhhhh ! alleged improved " word processing power " , i experienced more bugs then appear animal planet channel special insects amazon jungle . unwanted page formating changes occur when i click my mouse page i just finish reformatting . undesired line spacing would appear pages . list goes , but who time more detailed . yourself favor avoid product . if you need upgrade , check out latest version ms word , you far more satisfied i'm sure	1
i can't life me understand why rosetta stone garnered such good reviews ( although i see few negative ones here , so i feel validated ) seems such outstanding reputation . i find it practically worthless , it expensive boot . i'm sure my experience german program would apply rosetta stone other languages well , they all taught via same method . i've learning german 6 months besides rosetta stone i used pimsleur , rocket languages , taken private instruction . obviously , private instruction best . but this review software , pimsleur best . but rosetta stone more bells whistles , which perhaps why people think it so good . but it isn't . example , nowhere rosetta stone you actually learn how say useful things . nowhere you learn how say " hello , " " how you , " what your name , " or even " where bathroom . " instead , you learn how recognize such useful phrases " woman boy ball their heads " or " man under donkey " or " these two fish same species " or " blue triangle bigger than red square . " ridiculous !! note i said " learn how recognize phrase . " this biggest weakness disappointment rosetta stone . it really doesn't get you talk all . you not required utter word . you see four pictures , speaker say ( german ) " boy drinking milk . " now , if you already heard word " boy " ( junge ) three pictures no boys , you simply click picture boy presto , you're correct ! this multiple choice way learning not effective learning language ! ( there " practice speaking " mode , equally useless , which i mention below ) pimsleur , which audio only program , you hear conversations impart essential words phrases . they repeated ( asks you repeat ) such fashion it sticks . example , it weeks ago it introduced " how much i owe you ? " yet i still remember it . ( wie viel shulde ich ihnen ? -- no , i didn't cheat look it up ! ) pimsleur brilliant way it gradually builds your knowledge abilities . course , it isn't perfect it doesn't explain grammar . but neither rosetta stone , rosetta stone worse because pimsleur there also english speaker who explains some things , while rosetta stone you left twist wind . that why software language learning programs should seen supplements -- supplements classroom or private instruction . what bells whistles rosetta stone ? you get lesson variety ways -- seeing pictures audio ( speaker ) , or pictures audio text , or audio only , example . there also feature where speaker program says phrase , you repeat it into microphone compare your voice signature speaker . but i found this didn't work well all wasn't worth trouble . again , phrases weren't useful	-1

quickbooks " sunsetted " my previous version , forcing me buy this horriblle , buggy software . it lacks many features i liked my previous version ( 2003 ) , runs much slower , uses 10 times much memory , full bugs . i regularly need run windows system restore when all my company data disappears . avoid this product all costs . time i used spend more important business functions now spent trying get this crappy software work . i used quickbooks 12 years , 4 editions , but this my last intuit product . i wish i could give it 0 stars	-1

worked okay until i installed xp service pack 2 . now i no longer scan using my brother mfc-9700 paperport 9 . it long time since service pack 2 released , scansoft left everyone who bought paperport 9 cold . i could not care less if they now come up software compatible sp2 . this kind treatment customers makes it clear they not deserve our business . don't take my word it . google issue , you'll find out there lot dissatisfied customers . now , i'll avoid scansoft	-1
i needed document management system . after looking software , there only appeared paperport . i read somewhere software becomes incredibly slow large number files . i guessed large number meant 2500+ leas t.t his concerned me , so i called pre-sales scansoft , asked if it slow large number files . he not sure ! so he told me call technical . i called technical , it his responses very slow sounded like he reading them out me . i asked if he reading scansoft website he said yes , so i hung up . obviously i read their site answer , not need paying international call charge someone who seemed less knowledgeable than myself read it . i got software . basically all software consists windows explorer scanning software . it worked well , i thought ok , expensive what it , when windows explorer scanning software ( usually free ) would nearly most it , but then after around 560 pdfs , it started running very slow . i thought it my machine so installed it pdfs new vaio 1.7 mhz , 1 gig laptop . same problem . if you click view pdf then hit return back , it takes 12 seconds ! so if you view document , it takes good few seconds but then when you hit back paperport desktop continue it takes 12 seconds !!! completely unusuable ! if you less than 500 files , it maybe expensive software , but more than 500 not waste you money . it runs so slow you not use it . i wonder how scansoft get away it - surely they should tested it internally thousands files	-1

after using turbotax couple years then using taxcut last two years ( 2005 2006 returns ) i concluded turbotax much superior software . taxcut only advantage it cheaper . if you take out price equation , taxcut inferior quality . - 2005 taxcut software there not pdf output all forms . this pretty silly because after couple years if i want access my tax return i am not going install taxcut again my computer view return . i would rather my tax return available some widely acceptable format like pdf then access/distribute whenever i want ( i don't keep my documents hardcopies ) . so i wrote hr block . this year they added saving return pdf file feature available . but unfortunately , this far perfect . it excludes number important forms - example , irs form 8853 , california adjustment schedule 540ca etc . instead it saves numbers useless worksheet ( without any data entered those worksheets ) , same form multiple times . - most annoying thing this software updating incorrect data . one form i entered wrong data . while reviewing it i found problem went specific section update . but calculation taxcut still showed old incorrect number . i just could not make it use new corrected number . eventually i restart new return scratch - just dollar amount corrected . - many section useful helps missing	1
microsoft continues their legacy software doesn't work . i've using windows since very beginning 2000 professional windows xp only solid operating systems microsoft released . you would expect this so called upgrade further improve upon this , instead it many steps backwards . btw , i 4400 amd , 3 gigs ram , say vista slow slow slow . prepared everything run slower than it xp . cool interface , only positive thing vista i found so far . searches also much faster , but hardly reason upgrade . prepared windows updates after installing vista actually cause once working drivers stop working . i'm tempted go back xp , so needless say big waste time effort .	1
vista appropriated named . vista defines something great look . if all you look microsoft vista it would perfect operating system indeed . unfortunately vista computer operating system designed used there problem . vista so secure so over burdened layers upon burdensome processor power robbing layer sheer garbage it rendered totally completely utterly useless . vista take fastest xp computer turn it into slow worthless pile trash . vista so slow it takes me back days when i used walk away my ibm computer get cup coffee walk around building . what makes vista worse still microsoft office 2007 absolute pits word processing . add office 2007 vista you won't productive all but dang won't it look pretty . if you just want watch your computer make pretty colors areo-glass catch yourself some goofs watch vista . when you want work productive turn your xp computer . windows 2000 xp work hard while vista hardly works all . vista garbage don't buy this dreck ! everything you try vista not allowed . almost every peice equipment you run vista needs updated so called vista friendly versions . messed up windows explorer point where it beyond useless . problem vista microsoft taken all wizards helpful features far they could xp . vista they try top operating system pretty much what you asked it little fuss . vista software code writers just changing things because they could . vista makes nothing better or easier . fact vista built manner almost seems go out its way make even most simple compater related tasks unpleasant needlessly long boring tedious . word tedious best single word describe microsoft windows vista . vista succeeded bringing entire computer experience painfully new level purely tedious not dreamt before ! i just wish i could give vista no stars or more honestly negative star rating . i won't buying vista my current systems even when i get new computer i not using vista it comes pre installed . i my own old trusty xp disks i reinstalled xp last useful usable operating system microsoft made . xp goofy kiddie skool like interface ugliest operating system microsoft ever made but while it ugly duckling it work pretty well . vista far prettiest operating system microsoft ever made but it pretty dumb . vista over burdened programmatic junk way high opinion itself . vista so much more secure because all dumb security features make operating system unusable . any computer you make unusable most secure because you can't any productive work it . vista makes your computer experience endlessly tedious makes your computer system must see door stop . philosophy vista seems good computer should seen but never productively used . vista great system well monied executive wants look busy while doing nothing productive	-1
i've used ms streets trips years minor problems . this year i upgraded windows vista laptop wanted latest software it . i gps i use pocket pc pda so i need pocket streets . after i got home i read fine print box . it list support no higher than windows xp os . but , so far program running fine my vista machine . laptop no serial com ports st 2007 won't detect usb port . description st 2007 which includes gps indicates it uses usb port but apparently it needs included usb adaptor . i could not locate where i could purchase such adapter . st 2007 no longer ships pocket streets . nor could i locate where i could download copy . i ( now ) use my old pocket streets program because 2007 export pocket street maps . finally , within two miles my home map list airport runway shut down early 90 . main highway few blocks me only 3 exits 2 miles yet st 2007 list over dozen intersections which means when i get directions i always end up down dead-end road . i've purchase many versions streets trips this first time i felt i've wasted my money . open software can't returned where i purchased it . i guess i'll start researching other software packages .	1
new look very nice . but , when you install , you also keep previous version ( well behaved software , automatically previous version cleaned ... not here ) . system validation license through internet physical machine fine , i just hope i not disk crash then waste time authorised re-install product i rightfully paid ( such price ) . well , make sure you : - not try de-install 5 , 5 after install cs2 ( or bye-bye license)- clean robust backup your installation .... i am not sure i make next upgrade ....	1
i wanted new computer , so couple months ago i ordered hp computer happened vista it . i thought , " oh great , i'll get newest os well " ... major mistake . 1 . didn't work my perhipherals , including my scanner hp printer . god sake , computer hp , why won't it work hp printer !? if they knew drivers perhipherals weren't ready , why they release os force us buy it ? 2 . annoying security feautres , constantly asking permissions install software . just like apple ads -- total joke . 3 . after struggling damn thing 2 days , i decided try install old trusty xp it ... $200 later , guess what ? you cant install earlier operating system ! booting cd doesn't work either , you get blue screen death . maybe some tech geek it , but i'm wasting time this thing . 4 . all agony , what ?

i always thought laborious interviews turbotax pretty ridiculous , now i've seen opposite . taxcut online seems totally not thorough , such just asking total certain things , not asking if special circumstances apply , which you don't miss all until you one them . i almost completely finished my taxes got business use home . i moved half way through year . i couldn't find where add additional home office listing . " nope , can't it " said support after hour long chat session mostly waiting , " you'll use product . " so today i start scratch pay $99 ransom turbotax charging small business owners . i encourage competition get their shizzle together next year . :	1
i worked hard vcd project work using photo explosion . i didn't think it easy use , but it okay until i got ready burn . got little error message said something lines " you don't nero burners !

this software messed up my computer big time . it something first all , microsoft word . word not work properly after installation photo explosion . it then went into different areas my computer screwed it up . first i only suspected it photo explosion . i my computer sent back hp . when i got it back i reinstalled photo explosion same thing happenend . careful . product big problems - which give you bigger problems - i guarantee it .	-1
just paid [ ... ] this product , i expected word processing component least basics . wrong . me , ability easily format business or legal document " page " bottom page seems pretty fundamental . well , works 8.5 --- unlike other microsoft word processor versions or programs --- not provide choice . without this basic " feature " , you might well simply use wordpad . i cannot comment other abilities this program or doesn't , or , spreadsheet or database modules , because i simply don't want spend any more time this . recommendation : go openoffice.org get open office free	-1
i am no means computer idiot , i audit computer systems security living . i contact customer support ( webchat ) least 3-4 times during first 30 days installing software . install brand new system ( windows xp pro ) , all microsoft patches service packs little nothing else installed . first pest patrol would crash numerous times day until technical support walked me through complex workaround prevent active protection error window appearing over 100 times every 10 minutes ( which you click clear each one ) . second , firewall would tell me i not authorized visit certain webpages until technical support walked me through complex process deleting certain files created firewall resetting firewall after process involving safe mode . third , pest patrol never would run thorough scan . i'd receive two separate errors either said fatal error occurred pest patrol gui , or system resources not available . i contacted customer support they told me yes , sometimes pest patrol doesn't work all unless you use msconfig disable all startup services ( systems . ini , etc ) reboot , run pest patrol , then use msconfig enable startup services . it canned reply during live web session , which means operators probably used giving since it likely occurs many people . i haven't tried out third solution yet because i wanted remind myself write amazon review . if you looking simplicity , or don't know much computers , look elsewhere . otherwise you one major headache trying implement several technically involved workarounds . i'll give it two stars , since it didn't cause my dog choke , explode my house , or cause irreparable damage clothing ( which my one-star ) .	1
found registration number difficult read . customer service tell me they run into this all time ! i look like 1 . tried it again ! i got it load . my computer slowed down significantly ! certain sites i could not access anymore without re-configuring software . i used norton . mcaffee or whatever , other suite type security software . this one worst . i would not recommend it . i got well deserved refund	-1
this most user unfriendly turbotax i ever used . schedule imported misinformation , keep forcing correct info . i just found out my state taxes received showing i owed completely different amount than what i electronically filed . i used this program years , but after this , never again !!! let this warning others	-1
i used turbo tax least past eight years always very pleased it . this year however some " genius " decided change entire format approach i found this year version terrible . very confusing now when used clear simple . hard even download , confusing up dates , difficult find numerous frequently used items ( estimated taxes paid previous year , capital gains/losses , state taxes paid , more ) . running total taxes owed upper left hand corner came out different final taxes supposedly owed . i zero confidence this year program doing my taxes correctly so accountant return first time many years . recommended turbo tax many over years , but would strongly recommend against buying this year product . perfect example how take something good make it lousy messing it . suggest you save your money either go accountant or use firms software , this one stinks	-1
when i click " update components " , i'm continually told " feature still initializing , please try again later " . this happen even if i've program open hours . i've contacted trend micro , followed their instructions workaround , but still didn't help	1
i'd happy write review if i could ever get working copy this program . three different computers not one would disc install	-1
they changed everything ! effort make it more user friendly , they've rearranged most controls . menus replaced headings . it difficult accomplish what easy changes before . some this likely improve use . word 2007 constantly trying think you , auto formatting you type . however , it often isn't thinking what you , making it obey your commands frustrated new headings . particularly frustrating , when i " right-click " list restart numbering " " ( ie . after roman numeral ii outline ) , word 2007 flatly refuses . my research paper now formated : i . heading . subpoint . subpoint . subpoinii . heading . subpoint . subpoint . subpointiii . heading . subpoint etc .... etc ... this ridiculous inexcusable ! i also individually superscript 130+ footnotes . somehow , changing font widows default " calibri " back " time new roman , " footnote setting altered i yet determine how restore it . however , if i open new document it fine , but i really don't want retype 30+ page research paper . powerpoint 2007 works well enough , compared older version . they added few bell whistles , but nothing gets way . if you buy new computer you're likely stuck new ms office 2007 . but don't buy it until you . it not upgrade previous two versions	-1

i feel duped ! i bought spy sweeper computer store year ago . it 2.6 version . first everything great . i got my definitions , it found traces , it detected spy cookies . when i ran definition update , i no problem firewall . every time they said upgrade , i . then i started getting renew e-mail . i months go they sent me renewal e-mails sometimes two or three week i ignored them , not only because i knew year wasn't up , but i also suspicious it just spammer out get my credit card information . i e-mailed them asking if their renew mails really them , voicing my concerns . i got ignored , when i eventually got speak someone , they didn't even know what their renewal e-mail looked like ! problems began when i updated latest version which 4.5 . when i would try update my definitions i'd get warning there problem contact webroot , while it no problem noting i latest version updates . no settings changed , not even my firewall which blamed them . i think it them not me since now it suddenly happening . they refuse address it . then i checked their site my subscritpion . i knew i one because i bought it store , my subscription doesn't expire until june if i invalid i doubt i could upgrade newer versions . what their page say ? no subscription ! when i wrote i never got straight answer it . then i told program corrupted , download new copy latest version their site . i . what i get ? boxes said subscription not activated . they knew i one they won't change it their site or give me explanations . after pestering my latest version now say when i expire . i've asked why it goes online scan when it doesn't need i get ignored . so i decided call but wasn't sure how because i'm different time zone . it took several days them get back me e-mail saying their mountain time treated like my eastern time get hold someone . first person i spoke after four tries 15-20 rings each , nasty , especially when i told him slow down because he mumbled . i downloaded what he told me , he said nothing firewall issue despite him telling me he read my tickets i t.t he second person sounded like he'd smoked one too many joints after he decided answer phone after 15 rings . he didn't know how answer any my firewall questions or why their page kept saying i no subscription when program it latest version finally admitted i'm current after pestering . they don't give you straight e-mail answers . they don't answer their phones hoping after 15th ring you'll give up . it won't scan everything even when no other programs running . new version it found spy cookie , it kept repeating same one over over despite my checking it " always remove " . never previous versions . i don't like company who answers questions selectively . i don't like company who makes you wait 20 rings . i don't like company who blames your computer settings when they never affected previous versions . webroot spy sweeper replaced my desperate search find spyware program actually works , whose staff answers my questions not mislead me my subscription status	-1

if you accustomed using other versions coreldraw , you may not want this version . fact , they made many so-called " improvements " which i find incompatible other software i used past . it not convert encapsulated postscript ( eps ) files properly , crash programs traditionally work well eps figures . contrast , coreldraw 11 worked well . hence " improvement " rendered software nuisance . if you accustomed pasting figures into other software , forget it . coreldraw x3 not retain integrity original figure , it look distorted crummy . any prior version coreldraw worked well . again , " improvement " made software nuisance . top , it crashes lot . i contacted their " customer service " year ago when i first discovered these differences . i assured they knew problems working them . well , year later , no patches correct these differences , i am now told it everyone else fault ( software manufacturers ) coreldraw not compatible . i also told they no intention correct these problems because they not consider them problems . there example their customer service you . i using coreldraw long time , starting 6 , then 9 , then 11 . this worst bunch far . i am going back previous version .	1
careful this program . my wife bought it , i tried install it her our pc . i made several attempts , each time installation hung different stage installation procedure . when installation hung , i could not cancel or kill it , or even shut down pc without pressing reset button ( windows xp pro ) . i went support page web site , found faq item incompatibility zone alarm . if you're not familiar zone alarm , it personal firewall security product very common among home users . according nova development , only way get scrapbook factory deluxe 3.0 install permanently remove zone alarm . besides serious security risk , this extreme measure take . this seems perfectly ok nova development . they offer no workaround other than removing zone alarm pc . personally , this would enough give me pause installing product even if i not use zone alarm . you wonder what installer trying even presence dormant security software interferes it .	-1
i bought taxcut this year because it inexpensive included business tax forms my partnership . money i guess i'm satisfied partnership results , but that where it ends . taxcut federal taxes not integrated taxcut business ... ok so what you want cheap . but , it also isn't well integrated massachusetts state tax version , leaving me go figure how deal what it calls " special " situations ( unreimbursed partner expenses interest out state banks , example ) . overriding form data painful program complains if i override calculated data i not e-file ( not i would trust it e-file my taxes ) . form navigation hopeless . i only imagine what someone who isn't experienced tax preparation could accomplish this mess . i filed extension ; now i'm probably going buy turbotax actual federal state returns . deep discount , i would probably purchase taxcut again partnership taxes , because it slightly easier use than excel spreadsheets i'd using ( but only because i don't copy numbers spreadsheets into forms ) . honestly , you would think there would some tax software better than non-functional taxcut without overblown , fatty expensive too-many-talking-heads turbotax alternative	-1
" genius " educational simulation game , where you're building industrial complex -- plop down factories , roads , houses , fire departments such . game progresses , you complete physics puzzles obtain new technologies product improvements . you subscribe newspapers , which contain answers some questions knowledge or equations needed solve others . physics problems entertaining , well designed , well documented , implemented excellently , quite fun . they presented problems you encounter during business operation , example while developing new product . all information you need provided . game appeal children 8 up , but these physics problems more like age 16 up because they require high school math . so , children youths may need help parent who remembers algebra preferably physics -- yikes ! some questions easy fun . some require you comfortable algebra , converting units , applying formulae . few very difficult . fortunately , questions same each time , so after figuring out answers , you write them down just enter answers next time . sometimes game even gives you correct answer after it too late , so you write it down next time . unfortunately , i can't find cheat sheet list answers web -- too bad , this would really help . level difficulty these questions isn't problem , just warned . simulation side game suffers comparison . industrial simulation controls poorly documented . what each building when/why/where it appropriate/inappropriate how run game somewhat mystery . there no way figure out whether building something good or bad except trial error -- logic doesn't always help . bad decisions spiral out control , seem lead inevitably bankruptcy . unfortunately , wrong answers physics problems same effect . there " statistics " report supposed give feedback whether your company making or loosing money , but this form doesn't enough information . so , expect some trial error , some frustration , some algebra , some physics , some reading through magazines looking obscure clues .

not use this product . it very hard remove your computer . it harder install than norton , inferior product . i never buy their product again .	1
i agree other reviews this horrible piece software . i am software developer written some serious applications my career , this one ranks bottom barrel . i stock dell xp machine , after 15-minute install , audition 2.0 crashes every time startup . i never even got it run . tried calling adobe support -- useless ... waited 35 minutes hold then hung up . search google groups answers revealed nothing , their support site . i * loved * cool edit 2000 , even audition 1.5 some degree . this new version what happens when too many engineers get put project . it remnant once great application . avoid it like plague	-1
i am not bookkeeper . without bookkeeping software i would lost ! i own small business help keep books friend business . i quickbooks 1996 love it so i convinced my friend get this newer version . i am very disappointed format see very little similarity them . aarrrgh !	1
i very disappointed this software . it not really good anything i still haven't figure out why this even released . i own printmaster 15 , american greetings creata card 8 , few other photo scrapbook programs . this software templates make banners , cards , invitations , all stuff . templates few compared other programs then customize them , well you really can't . if you try start out blank template add your own photos you limited what you . no borders , edging , font manipulating . it just insert photo , some basic photo touch ups pretty much it . i wanted add shadows , edges , frames my pictures couldn't . fonts could only made single color . you could not add outlines or drop shadows , nothing . add font , pick your size , pick your style , it . you only save their 1 file format which course only works zoom . no e-mailing or file converting . what good this program i yet find out . i spend time make birthday invitation my own pictures . well guess what , i couldn't e-mail it my guests . print all it . complete waste money . this first software i ever purchased i returning . spend few extra bucks get something like print master , print shop , or something comparible	-1
i am very disappointed this program . i doing my own graphics/cards 10 years . i started print shop ( early edition ) progressed thru all updates . i then switched printmaster loved it !!! again , i progressed each new verion very little or no problems ... until now ! this got worst worst --- program not want load without babied . when it finally loaded , it very confusing i found i needed get my graphics internet ! area i live only allows me dial up --- you imagine how long it takes get graphics i want ! if you interested doing your own graphics/cards , skip this program ... go back printmaster platinum 16 much better results . far i am concerened , river deep company needs hide this edition deepest river they find	-1
i love printmaster . i'm currently using printmaster 16 platinum . i used many generations this program great success . i taught classes creative desktop publishing always recommended -- even sold -- printmaster , but this one terrible ! most images , even previews , seem online require download which very slow . thumbnails low resolution hard see , so you download previews just get good look . most images can't accessed all , because there prompt intall/program disk . there no such disk . there separate install program disks , neither which satisfies program . encore , which now distributes program , not support it . broderbund not not support it , except through its website which not address this issue . if you try phone customer service , you pay call get automated response which sends you response which tells you go website . not purchase this product without money-back guarantee	-1
everyone uses office . everyone familiar office . so why ms change interface make it nearly impossible get anything ? i am computer savy ( i'm engineer ) i find new ribbon interface totally infuriating . worst all there no way go back " old " drop down menu system . it honestly takes me 10x time get anything word/powerpoint because they've buried functionality behind these ridiculous ribbons . ms claims you able much more productive once you're familiar ribbons . i don't know/care whether that true or not . learning curve get point fluency their new ui immense . so much so time investment become proficient far far far out ways any " increase " productivity .... not mention it overpriced . offce 2003 far superior product	-1
product fine , but , i received older version result i couldn't properly update it even after registering it . result , i purchased newest version available directly lavasoft it works fine i no trouble updating it . why didn't you specify what version it your website ; then i could made informed decision ?	1
updates frequent expensive . good program , but it not worth trouble expense upgrading	-1
this program causes my computers blue screen . trend micro contacted twice , but not responded	-1
major flaw this product it not clear which version office you upgrade . note : it not work office sbe !! various sources say various things , even microsoft site isn't helpful	-1
well you certainly able recognize words answer questions correctly , but if you're expecting understand what words actually mean ... i wouldn't recommend this . i able answer first seven chapters easily get all questions right but i no idea what any words sentence/caption actually mean . i've used it month know i no greater knowledge chinese than when i started ....	1

this product dependent constant upgrades because most current version 2006 tax forms often not available when it first comes out . nature product . however , third year row , many macintosh users run into problems their automated online form upgrade process . if automated upgrade process not work , you upgrade manually , but somewhat complex process . alternatively , you order snail mail version upgraded program , if you ever get through phone number you call . they always seem encountering large volume calls no matter what time you call . its great product once you get it upgraded contain most recent version forms . i wonder if automated upgrade process works windows users ? any rate , until they fix automated upgrade process , important part software , i rate it low possible	-1
used turbotax years no real problems . low rating due following : bought this store discovered later when trying download state it federal only ! if i known i would ponied up extra minor $ store rather than extra $30 download . last year state included this version - this year intuit new fine-grained tiering their product line ripped me off ! also , price this product way too high , lack upgrade path ( pay less if you loyal customer ) completely sucks . intuit almost lost me couple years ago when they introduced product activation . they serious danger losing me again	1
this program works after it installed , but installation process unbelievably flawed . if you version norton your computer already , this may cause all kinds problems new installation . not only i uninstall all versions ( after norton lets you install new one ) , but i make bunch changes windows , also . top , while you're struggling install ( i got it one computer easily , second some difficulty , third ... well , it several days struggle ) , norton counts down number days subscription . so if you install one computer today , two months later , then your subscription all your machines still expires year now . i don't see how symantec put out program doesn't allow you upgrade easily ... after all these years , they can't fix this major bug ? that just pathetic	1
bought this 3-pack 2 months ago ( three computers home ) worked ok- no viruses . then i what i thought clean install xp pro xp home one computers , it carried over lot garbage xp home i wanted get rid , but that issue ( clean install ? } . after installing xp pro , i warned i didn't virus protection so i tried installing my nav again . you would think some point nav would enough brains try establish this windows upgrade , nav legitimate . nope- fatal error computer lock-up , which i able survive . no contact opportunity symantec web site . i simply opted microsoft recommended anti-virus software- computer associates . twenty . then i heck time uninstalling nav , which wouldn't install now wouldn't uninstall . what waste time money . who creates these viruses ? we certainly know who benefits them . there really nothing you do- they immune unless they hurt someone media clout . this little note means diddily , but thanks amazon anyhow opportunity say something .	-1

i excitedly upgraded office 2007 ....

i very excited get this game . i read previously written reviews . my 13 yr old daughter wants become veterinarian someday loves spending time computer , so this just seemed like perfect christmas gift . alas , game many faults interfere game enjoyable ! i should listened reviews ..... game extremely glichy ! it makes playing it very hard frustrating . my daughter tried one week given up . characters get stuck just stand vibrate screen until you start game over . sometimes she play half hour before it starts up sometimes it this right away . very disappointing . also , some internal setup issues actual cd it works better running disk then saving it computers hard drive . we pretty new computer , we windows xp - this program just doesn't run well off our computer anyway . we other games don't this problem . fact my son got game - building machines inventions - it doesn't any these problems actually requires more my hard drive . also , my daughter complains some limitations within pet vet don't allow her change . you pay specified amount hire employee employee this game slouch - there no other choices when hiring staff , no wage choices , you can't get this employee work or you cannot hire anyone else . overall because gliches game , she hasn't able play it programs full potential given up .... so idea great .. but makers should looked this better before taking consumers money putting it market . i cannot find any fixes or downloads online repair it either . big bummer !!! beware ! just don't buy this one , look elsewhere	1

i using norton anti-virus since i purchased compaq presario 4000 . reason i stuck norton because this presario came norton internet security 2002 attached it . i never used nis 2002 , though , but i purchased norton anti-virus ( nav ) 2003 which i bee using last three years . fact i used nav 2004 two straight years without any response symantec , then all sudden subscription eventually retired symantec . i liked nav 2005 ( which symantec six months prior its due date subscription , which made me mad hence my wanting try nis subsidized rate ) because like nav 2003 , it could tell if someone or something trying intrude into your computer . it after purchasing trying nis 2005 , i realized how low base norton go its software . first when i tried nis 2005 , it blocked all my websites . i couldnt access them i could not read my e-mail ( whenever i tried read my e-mail , response would , action cancelled ) . so i reformatted my hard drive nis 2005 appeared working quite well until i tred install adobe reader 7.08 couldn't allow me proceed . moreover , it snail slow allowing me read one mail . so i uninstalled nis 2005 installed nav 2006 , which appears working well . i now purchased tend micro pc-cillin 2006 well mcafee viruscan 2006 subsidized rates , should symantec pematurely terminate my nav 2006 prematurely i.e. before 366 days subscription over . i think one reasons why nis could not work it program it trying more than it chew . it tried anti-virus , personal firewall , privacy control , antispam well parental control one . it reminds days when it better purchase cassette player separate radio , since technology time could not produce good combined raio cassette player . i think norton internet security mode . it not yet competent produce combined solution both antivirus anti spam , anti-spyware same time . hence many complaints its buggy program . this stage , i would stay away any program calls itself " internet security . " i may try trend micro internet security which received rave reviews couple its users , but if something goes wrong my current nav 2006 . otherwise , i am still wary those programs pass off " internet security " such " norton internet security " or " trend micro internet security , " pending their perfection this technology some future date	-1

i am really thinking returning it amazon . i think i stick good-'ol ms word . you see i wanted 12-page form spent two days creating it . it form survey boats so it also graphic areas photos ( 12 ) . well , all seemed fine until you printed filled form . pdf . size created . pdf near 10mb !

this product horrifying . it worked three months , which point it experienced complete meltdown . started getting auto-protect errors , suddenly could access internet explorer , but not firefox . it kept trying send me live update , which wouldn't work , so i uninstalled reinstalled norton . now error happened again , i could access internet firefox , but not explorer . error message referred me online " fix , " but -- guess what ! -- you can't access any their fixes firefox . you must using explorer . ( which , itself , offensive obnoxious . ) explorer , course , wasn't working . ( incidentally , norton uninstalled , all worked fine , so indeed source problem . ) uninstalled reinstalled norton again , hoping get explorer get fix before error recurred , but now i couldn't get internet all . point , i uninstalled norton good . ditto fact they don't support product , apparently don't stand behind product , apparently aren't very concerned their reputation . very disappointing . previous versions just fine ; this complete mess	-1

come one people , windows vista not only unstable it windows predecesors very uglu memory management really unsecure ineffective hard drive files management ; i've lost lots very important files due windows " errors " shut down applications even pc itself , so i decided my self : use linux or die microsoft !, i'm still alive ! ;-) i told you , vista nothing more but cheap copy visual effects linux users several years now ; facto , right now i'm using linux version called sabayon it million light years away windows vista , it visual effects simply incredible ( try searching " beryl " youtube you know what i'm talking aboyt ) , i not only 3d windows , but 3d desktops , incredible effects minimize maximize veeeery looooong list features you see it yourself beleave it . i know you might concerned several aspects this points wooried me time ( when i evaluating windows vs linux ): 1 . - my documents , happen them ?. nothing happen , fact you'll ba able open them modify them you please , oppenoffice suite totally compatibble your microsoft documents . 2 . - my programs ?, well there several options run windows programs linux , " cedega " , " wine " , etc etc etc , si it means you able run most windows programs linux . 3 . - it hard use ?. no way !, it easy use windows , you only dedicate few time ( may couple hours ) understand several conceps multiple destops , file system , users permission management ( one most secures world ) ( microsoft windows cant say ! ) . so , if you don't beleave search google sabayon youtube beryl you open your eyes !. so ... think spending this 400 bucks twice , because sabayon other versions ubuntu , kubuntu , some versions suse , other linux distributions totaly free charge !. you only download them burn it cd or dvd , whatever you like .	-1

i trouble no satisfaction this product . i am downloading grateful dead concerts internet . i want turn them into audio or data cds . sometimes i get whole concert one giant file ; i want cut into tracks save it . sometimes i get bunch tracks ; i want combine songs " go into " one ( my car stereo inserts two-second delay tracks ) . one things i want save files ( which mostly mp3s ) same bit rate format originals , so i loose little " music " possible . mp3 codec seems really buggy . most combinations bit rates codec strategies create really wacky files : some go 5/6 normal speed , others compressed into chopped up shortened versions original . when i pick combination settings work , i usually lose lot fidelity compared original ( even when i'm only combinining four mp3 into one ) . try cutting one mp3 into two , then recombining parts into whole . no matter what i try , there little click place where two files joined . this should easy thing , since lot very basic editing cutting splicing . upshot , buying this $40 down drain . i'm going find better software my purposes	-1

this my first year using turbotax , it also my last ! since 1992 i faithful user hr block taxcut mac . spite it costing more than windows version , i used it every year except 1995 when various problems related my aol dial-up service prevented me using it . since turbotax only option out there people who use mac , you'd think i'd continuing use them now , - but you'd wrong ! i purchased my copy turbotax deluxe amazon.com save $5 . since taxcut made certain no information it software could ever imported other software , i filled my personal data i began . i little disappointed turbotax doesn't allow you skip " step-by-step " method , just fill actual forms way taxcut option . while downloads annoyance ( 6 or 7 separate files each time ) , most part software ok . picking up where you leave off wasn't always possible , but 5 or 6 clicks would get you back right spot . my first major annoyance came state software . after filling some data , seeing overall results , i wanted look forms see what they doing my data . i also needed see where they placed data imported federal information i'd entered . well , there no way see your data state forms until you're finished print them out ( or preview . pdf files print dialogue ) . when you software somehow magically creates state forms printing , but state forms don't seem exist anywhere else except print spool ! i found this extremely annoying , real time waster . final blow , however , when i got filing . advertising unnecessary annoyance . since i don't owe any state taxes , i just usually print those forms out mail them --- it doesn't make any sense me pay filing something when i don't owe anything i'm not going benefit " faster " refund . then i came crusher . turbotax wanted $30 e-filing my federal forms !! taxcut charged $14.95 $15.95 , but then they always rebated cost . i told intuit used , but obviously they decided make some additional money this year . earlier day i filed saw head irs cnbc interviewed . he said e-filing makes their job so much simpler . well , if it helps them much , they should devise way computer users who buy software file returns directly irs without intuit , block others middlemen . they should let us file free if it makes their work so much easier . while i my doubts services allow you fill out online forms , then your filing you , i haven't heard any security problems them , so that direction i'm planning take next year . far i'm concerned , turbotax blew it unfair their e-filing fees	-1
i using turbo tax since 1998 , i use computers every day , ( engineer ) i am used using difficult applications ( pro-e , mathcad , ug , etc ) . this years edition turbo tax deluxe worst turbo tax i ever seen ( i usually like it very much ) . i purchased january update 4 times . one update took 6 hours ( some us live boonies broadband not option ) . addition , application brought up menus selections not applicable ( farm income pa state form ) . when i tried delete entries ( federal level instructed ) they would not . my 1 business expense entry kept getting duplicated ( " copy 2 " every time i deleted it , it would reappear next pass through . every time i entered " state " tab , it acted like i never there before " start state " button always lead me through all same questions ( it retain my answers prior visits ) . where " continue state " button ? i also noticed using " back " button then moving foreward again caused never before seen dialogs occur , even though same " foreward " choices made . once i backed up check something then moving foreward caused my state tax status jump +$46 -$1548 !! upon backing up i saw some check boxes regarding sale my home unchecked . i not check them , but rather backed up two more screens , then moved foreward again two screens boxes again checked ! one more foreward click my taxes again returned +$46 . one years i liked best when there " checklist " so you could see where you what already addressed . this years state definetly worse than federal , but even dissapointment . i complete this years filings submitted both online , i hope i don't get burned ! turbo tax ! -- please improve next year or it may my last year . you realize 59.95 + 39.95 filing + my time + aggravation like this year , accountant looking attractive . if you " inside " you probably know why this happening ... outsourcing code gen india , not outsourcing code gen india , programmer cut-backs , programming application changes , archiving application changes , project management issues , whatever . just realize there problem fix it	1

i used this program 5-state road trip midwest , while overall it " adequate , " it some key shortcomings . bad stuff : first , this not especially user-friendly program ; there steep learning curve operate it ease predictability . spend lot time playing this before using it primary navigator ! lot commands not intuitive , you need go through lot menus figure things out . this problem when you road looking get somewhere . it doesn't lot clickable buttons main screen . example , get program talk you , you must certain tab bottom screen . if you any other many tabs , program doesn't talk you or show you turns . it took me hours figure this out ! help function useless . second , tracking very slow , result you easily overshoot your turns -- especially when there no physical street signs many areas country -- which happened me numerous times . many times screen showed me i lot farther go before scheduled turn , this caused me overshoot it when there no sign . third , " rerouting " function awful perhaps biggest problem this program : if you stray route -- even pull off get gas -- program flips out keeps trying route you back original route even if route not easiest or most direct . i not found way it manually or automatically calculate new different route . i also found no way modify route once you begin route ( see below ) . several times several different cities , re-routing function totally wrong -- spitting out names streets weren't even screen close zoom level . this really annoying glitch , it happened without fail every time i strayed route . once off route , there no way hush program yelling you you're off route , there also no way easily program recalculate change route . when there construction you didn't anticipate , example , this program sucks able change route once you've started it . very annoying . there no construction updater plug-in , which would helpful long term construction projects go forever . fourth , program not audibly warn you if you going wrong way one way street . this actually happened me , there no " one way " signs particular street springfield , il . though there green arrows screen indicate one-way , but voice commands didn't warn me i actually going wrong way , so i not looking screen , i wouldn't known . you can't always look screen when driving . iowa i35 , construction brought northbound drivers over southbound lanes . i heading north southbound lanes ( i supposed ) but there no visual or audible indication i going wrong way ! big time safety issue here . fifth , search function wholly lacking not easy use . i needed find police station while missouri -- no such luck . i also needed find state fairgrounds missouri ( which i later came across screen ) but it not show up when i intentionally searched it . search limitations second biggest problem this program . sixth , several times screen showed me " off route " totally blacked-out area no roads around me when i fact u.s. highway or interstate . something wasn't communicating correctly . other times screen showed me more than 1000 feet off highway even though i certainly highway . illinois , screen showed i pretty much driving through corn fields even though i u.s. route . this problem pronounced multi-lane highways . if you're not center lane , often program indicates you're off route . very annoying . seventh , zoom level not stay constant ; it fluctuates automatically high zoom far-out zoom . i wanted high zoom most time see all minor roads landmark indicators , but program kept zooming out every few minutes . eighth , help function joke . it totally lacking substantive information . program should come separate dvd movie showing how use it . ninth , program not recognize lot road name synonyms . example , some u.s. routes also county/state/local designation numbers and/or alphabetic name , but map often only listed one or two many " also known " names/numbers . this quite problematic when signs roads don't match up turn commands ( e.g. " turn left u.s. route 40 , " when only street signs showed alphabetic name no numbers . this also quite annoying . tenth , antenna comes program sucks . without fail , i would get red " no signal " indicator every city i where there high-rise buildings . this happened kansas city , des moines , indianapolis , springfield . if you city , you risk no gps tracking ability . yes , my antenna mounted recommended . one point i held it up through my open sun roof no success . eleventh , main-screen buttons way too small use while driving if laptop your passenger seat . you pretty much pull over or risk crashing see what you're clicking . yes , i'm aware disclaimer program states you should separate navigator operate program while driving . i'm also aware almost no one who uses this program actually navigator/operator . twelfth , trip planning lacking . when you input starting ending point , program gives you one route . there no way easily plan alternate routes or preview them . true , you things like program it not take you toll roads , but this function not easy use . several times program kept me off interstates when i wanted them , sometimes it kept my interstates when i wanted u.s. or smaller county roads ( sightseeing purposes ) . i would go off route listen program whine off route . thirteenth , i emailed list my concerns/constructive criticisms/recommendations folks delorme . never heard back them , which concern me quality issue . ok , so there some redeeming qualities : first , * general * gps tracker on-target . 95% my 2000-mile trip , i knew where i program operated just fine . just realize this program ( well gps general ) lot limitations , especially when there bad weather or you woodsy area or place lot obstructions . third , you easily add points interest comments yourself . i used this function lot mark places where i want return take photos daylight . fourth , there selectable function show high contrast colors ( black background bright road colors ) . this quite helpful . summation , money this program good deal , but not rely it ( or any gps program ) your * sole * source road information/navigation . if i hadn't my rand mcnally paper road atlas back-up state city maps i borrowed library , i would big trouble several times . there lot ways this program should improved , but meantime i'd still recommend it despite problems . knowing limitations i've listen save you time frustration . there no better alternative imho price . it possible some my complaints fixes , but you wouldn't know it crappy help function .	1

i upgraded version 5 . i don't use very many features . but big difference i see , files sizes seem greatly reduced . something i would scan 10mb , now might 2mb . this just opinion , nothing scientific . interface takes some getting used , bit different . overall price ($99 - less $20 rebate ) , great deal	1

honestly , i don't know how much more they improve adobe acrobat . it excellent product , god-send electronic file management . i upgraded version 6.0 . only problem i 6.0 it seemed terribly slow . this new version seems much brisker . it loads quickly , files seem " print " it much more quickly than version 6.0 . i not utilize " one-button " feature it provides ms office other programs . i try keep all my programs non-integrated possible , because my previous experiences showed they really , really bog each other down , no matter how much their makers claim they won't . i don't come close using all features acrobat , but my needs , it far surpasses anything else i've tried ( or researched ) . if you're problems version 6.0 , or older version you just want upgraded , i strongly recommend this . however , i don't foresee ever needing upgrade acrobat again	1
first , if you're thinking using these photos print , you may wish think again . most objects run 300-600 pixels width or height , or 1-2 inches 300 dpi . stretch them bigger than , they'll start blur and/or get jagged . also note , if you try export/save image hemera image browser select 300 dpi setting , browser may stretch graphic larger than it actual size , causing blurring jaggedness right out gate . you need use " use image full size " checkbox when exporting images . if you specify 300 dpi size , don't use checkbox , you'll get stretched image . example , first image collection ( pocket watch ) only 384 pixels wide . if you specify 300 dpi don't check " use image full size " box , software stretch it 642 pixels wide . stretching cause image look fuzzier and/or more jagged when you use it web site or print project . all said , if you're going use images web , they're great . you get almost all images you'd find their three " photo objects " collections , each which much more expensive than this single collection . difference photo objects collections offer 20-30% higher resolution ( i.e. first image collection 384 pixels wide , but 492 pixels wide photo objects ) you save photo objects images transparent backgrounds ( while this collection forces you specify color background ) . price , this good collection . there lots shots minor variations , so it may seem like duplication , but someone trying get something just right , slightly different tilt head may just what doctor ordered	1
great sw , easy learn , good graphics . really helps visualize space when you see it 3d . could improved if numerous similar objects could selected changed simultaneously ( e.g. , windows , doors , cabinets get all same materials , colors , hardware rather than one time - very labor intensive ) . should warn users select/create style then copy/paste them where needed . also , difficult ( maybe impossible , because i haven't figured out how it ) change room's/house overall style once you start given design	1
i ordered box version amazon , instead download manufacturer not only because it less expensive , but main reason so i would paper manual . so many programs don't come hard copy manuals i prefer them over on-line help . program itself , i trialed download first . me , thing i fell love ability call up multiple images , side side , compare them ! it makes selecting best image breeze - huge timesaver . you also ability swiftly zoom check focus full rez . wonderful thing putting curser over one preview images , sliding it , slide all open previews simultaneously , so you don't individually zoom move each image . you this up 6 images time ! you also quick histogram check hitting " " key , which makes it easy toss off bad exposures same time review . while you've got previews open you hover mouse over them hit any # key color-code image . colors keyed whatever description you want . i " 1 = green " yes , " 2 = yellow " maybe , " 3 = red " no . there room quite few more colors after . i then hit sort key back main screen quickly select all red " no " images delete them . after i all my green " yes " images , i then review them 6 time give them star ratings . i resort rating now all best images top page i start processing them . you batch process file name , some other things i don't bother , well . it got some nice keywording ability you easily sync keywords your photoshop files . what incredibly nice you click any word keyword list all images you own , those keywords , immediately shown thumbnails ! finding image actually fun ! it even give you thumbnails images you don't even store your hard drive anymore ! fantastic program - i highly recommend it ! only reason i didn't 5 star it b/c it not all intuitive . this read-the-manual kind program , but you awful lot it without get too far book . ;)	1

if you decide buy current greeting card program , there really only two front-line choices : art explosion greeting card factory ( currently version 5 ) or hallmark card studio ( currently 2006 ) . there other programs available specifically creating cards , but most them low quality outdated , aren't really worth considering . ( competitive third product featuring american greetings designs sadly now long outdated ; designs american greetings program similar quality those hallmark package ) . so how these two products match up ? without question , if you looking quality " canned " cards , hallmark program wins . hallmark designs professional , equal quality cards you would purchase store . contrast , designs art explosion adequate but surely not up quality store-bought card . hallmark program also able simply correctly print several different types card store ( although you stuck choices pre-programmed into software unless you want much frustration ) . art explosion poorer job correctly simply printing variety card stock configurations . art explosion beats hallmark program editing options ( more extensive ) , amount additional art ( clipart , etc . ) included package . if you not plan use " canned " cards , then i would recommend art explosion . but average user likely appreciate professional , high quality cards hallmark package . personally , i consider choice hallmark package over art explosion no brainer . note versions : publisher comes out new version hallmark program every year ( 2003 , 2004 , 2005 , 2006 , etc . ) same true art explosion greeting card factory . used many these versions , i find very little reason recommend upgrading year year . disappointingly , stock cards hallmark program not seem changed appreciably many years , same true art explosion .	1

my dad got this me supplement latin textbook i studying my high school language course . it quick easily understandable . you get plenty words phrases , which perfect traveler . if you want learn language sake knowing it , not travel , however , you'd better get book supplement this . it doesn't teach pluralization , verb conjugation , or other oddities language holds , such , latin , ending -m which implies direct object . latin cd also not use dashes over vowels ( ie . ,,,, ) . overall , i am very happy product price $39.99 ( usd ) , but i am also quite glad i my textbook ( ecce romani ) go it	1
i couldn't found better x-men product . every mag . its own pdf . readability only limited size your monitor	1
while i love content overall idea , it seems they seriously skimped packaging . all you get , outside outer box , cd paper envelope . no jewel case , book , insert , etc ....... perhaps it cd	1

i decided get this office suite after using it recently . i've usually worked office 97 2000 , but 2003 version some pretty cool features not found older versions . feature i really enjoy pivot report feature ms access , which wasn't ms access 2000 . this truly great reporting feature . you now use access front-end slice dice data stored data warehouses oracle , sql server , sybase other enterprise-type databases . if you're used creating crosstab reports , you'll definitely like pivot report feature . crosstabs limited 2 dimensions but there no limitation number dimensions pivot repor t.t o me , main drawback price . ( i get mine around $370 jr , which great price . ) i figure i upgrade this 5 years time , which works out $70 $75 per year ( assuming i'll paying $370 upgrade 5 years time . ) big positive this industry standard . so work you put into learning multiple new features word , excel , ms access not wasted because you reuse same skills job . your time well spent . note software may seem bloated but intelligent user able choose pick most useful relevant features each application ignore features not useful . different features useful different people ... positive : each product office professional fully programmable using visual basic applications ( vba ) which you use build custom programs . this very powerful feature sometimes overlooked when shopping office suites .	1
i've using studio years while i definitely reliability problems studio 10.0 , 10.6 very reliable , beta testing 10.7 shows me it just getting better . i tried premiere elements but it much harder figure out how things , it much slower burning simple dvd image , it simply doesn't hd which i've started playing . i'm sticking studio i make dvd just every week my kids ' videos . i recommend you good system fairly clean	1
i bought version 5 this software few years ago very pleased many features . tech my isp ( bellsouth ) recommended this software me . i recently purchased version 6 my new laptop which running windows xp pro . installation snap . updates frequent install quickly my dsl connection . software suite my opinion more better features than norton pro which i use my desktop . i really like registry cleaner ( fixer ) defrag tools . ( they use trend micro virus protection ) program allows simple maintenance or more experienced users indepth tools allow you maintain tweak your system . there lot extra programs come this software i not install after reading some reviews warnings using them . however , my personal experience after installing just system suit 6 professional really good me . i bought my copy walmart filled out rebate following instructions carefully i received my rebate after 6 weeks . i hope if anyone buys this software because my recommendation similar results . i would rate my knowledge computers above average , which may why i not any problems software .	1

i won't include my website url here , but i'm professional photographer , who displays sells his work juried exhibitions . i've using photoshop since version 5.0 , roughly 6-7 years . frankly , i'm surprised see how many negative reviews there here photoshop cs2 , overall product only gets three stars . i understand all frustration , though . even top-of-the-line machine , " ps cs2 " slow times . however , my case , that because i'm working incredibly large files . example , my camera / scanner combination typically produces 50 megapixel images . time multiple layers added ps , one image file 500 mb - 1 gb size . this exactly why i dual-opteron system 4 gb ram : so i work these monster files photoshop ! me , photoshop must-have . there * no * alternative programs me consider handle my files what i want get . i don't even want mention all advanced features i use daily basis , frankly because that part my edge professional . i've spent over five years working ps everyday , carefully studied several advanced books ps . learning curve long , but rewards great if you high goals high standards . yeah , adobe got some major improvements make , lines other reviewers mentioned . me , only real problem poor often wasteful use system memory . i would agree other reviewers here most people , full photoshop cs2 probably waste money . photoshop elements probably better way go , though i haven't used it personally . i know good web designer who uses paint shop pro , who seems happy . imho , some people probably drawn photoshop way others drawn autocad or solidworks or 3d studio max . all these programs incredibly powerful tools support entire career if one puts time effort become true expert user . you can't make career out ps elements , or paint shop pro , or gimp , or whatever else other reviewers may mention . ps cs2 " standard " image manipulation	1

if you decide buy current greeting card program , there really only two front-line choices : art explosion greeting card factory ( currently version 5 ) or hallmark card studio ( currently 2006 ) . there other programs available specifically creating cards , but most them low quality outdated , aren't really worth considering . ( competitive third product featuring american greetings designs sadly now long outdated ; designs american greetings program similar quality those hallmark package ) . so how these two products match up ? without question , if you looking quality " canned " cards , hallmark program wins . hallmark designs professional , equal quality cards you would purchase store . contrast , designs art explosion adequate but surely not up quality store-bought card . hallmark program also able simply correctly print several different types card store ( although you stuck choices pre-programmed into software unless you want much frustration ) . art explosion poorer job correctly simply printing variety card stock configurations . art explosion beats hallmark program editing options ( more extensive ) , amount additional art ( clipart , etc . ) included package . if you not plan use " canned " cards , then i would recommend art explosion . but average user likely appreciate professional , high quality cards hallmark package . personally , i consider choice hallmark package over art explosion no brainer . note versions : publisher comes out new version hallmark program every year ( 2003 , 2004 , 2005 , 2006 , etc . ) same true art explosion greeting card factory . used many these versions , i find very little reason recommend upgrading year year . disappointingly , stock cards hallmark program not seem changed appreciably many years , same true art explosion .	1
i am enjoying this new card shop they refreshing great cards others not . my friends family i made cards think they best also . keep making more more . thank	1

you see other reviews above , studio series history buggy . you also hear lot people saying " this package so much more intuitive easy use than other ' powerful enough worth owning ' packages -- if only it more stable ! " i am one those long-suffering users ( 5 years , going back version 9 ) , finally version 10.6 i stopped complaining -- it now works i'd hoped when i bought it . $300 i spent other packages trying better wasted -- i kept getting frustrated interfaces 500-page manual couldn't clarify . i'm very sophisticated computer user most measures . i am turning all our old family video tapes cd into dvd . i use studio all editing ( not tried dvd recording -- just use roxio ) am now very pleased . if you own 10.5 then version 10.6 free download . one important piece advice would saved me lots problems : put every " project " you work separate subdirectory . if you 5 soccer game videos make /game1 , /game2 etc . series subfolders . if you edit those " jimmy great plays " proect , put it separate /jimmyplays folder . when projects same folder you edit them few times weird overwrite problems happen 10.5 . i learned this trick before 10.6 came out , i don't know if it matters any more but i take no chances . why i stick something where i admit version 9.0 " powerful but unstable " 10.0 " more powerful more unstable " ? because i actually use studio minimal reference instructions , when i use it things turn out i expect . now it become stable reliable i am very satisfied customer . so that how i got frustrated studio customer giving it 4 stars this review . i tell whole story so you understand other reviews frustrated people relevant older versions , but " 10.5 updated free 10.6 " really best choice out there now ... my unused expensive rivals studio my shelf prove . just keep putting every project inn its own folder !	1

far gps software goes , there nothing better available than streets trips autoroute . there dozens features you can't find self-contained gps units . it easy add multiple stops optimize them into best order , night-view great feature , topographical maps . new feature offered this year , easy-linking satellite photos places map , also welcome addition . only reason i'm giving it four because following : 1 ) there still no ground-level or 3d view roads use gps function2 ) they still haven't added option exclude roads ban trucks or commercial traffic form using them . 3 ) there isn't lot coverage eastern european countries , most notably , nothing russia . nonetheless , it still better than any other gps software market	1
those already familiar , i excited this edition when it advertised it now works raw files . this one advantages adobe photoshop elements . i nikon digital slr i often shoot raw convert . jpg if i want edit microsoft digital imaging . when i went out buy this " anniversary " edition , very small print it reads it same previous 2006 edition " except " support raw files no longer included . still , it sale ($24 ) i thought upgrade would cool . when i used it , i saw little or no difference this than microsoft digital image 10 i already using . my opinion , upgrading 10 isn't worth it . those new this product , let me start saying , i've long time user microsoft digital imaging products . i enjoy bright , clean look interface . more , i love how simple it use . i would recommend microsoft digital image all skill levels , but especially anyone who just starting out digital photography computers . hands down , it easiest . it one step what would take three photoshop elements . you sacrifice come control , but simplicity focus this program . adobe photoshop elements more powerful , but harder use . bottom line , if you want concentrate getting out taking good pictures instead spending lots time editing , get microsoft digital imaging . average shutterbug , it'll edit just good photoshop elements less time less money .	1

not sure how i got it , but i got browser hijacker adaware spybot wouldn't get rid . top i got trojan these programs my avast antivirus wouldn't get rid . so out desperation something quickly , i went . buy bought this $40 . they didn't large selection , so i put down money it . imagine my feeling when i saw it amazon $20 . still this product works well . it made me uninstall spybot , adaware , turn off my windows firewall install it . you install it 3 different computers , or it asked you switch your license one them , should you install it fourth time . so you install it more than 3 times , you jsut switch your lisenses .. understand ? product works very well got rid my problems . you get updates 1 year , then you renew . i think this stupid personally , but its trend now days . its rip ... you pay $40 spyware or virus protection it should good more than year . several annoying windows pop up time time asking me what i want it . i wish there some default user setting so program could it . firewall slows down your connection , but they all . i 3mg dsl my speed test down around 1300k , so i've lost alot bandwith . i guess its worth protection . before spybot adaware , spyscans would typically find 25+ issues spyware . now trend micro , i find only 5 10 issues my weekely scan . so i'm happy product , except my decrease dsl speed	1

this 3 copy version norton av . ( one cd create three copies ) i purchased it save money it less than $20 per copy . i bought it replace nav 2006 same three computers which expired . installed easily two machines . just uninstall 2006 install 2007 . first machine more difficult . there evidently some conflicting software computer i use msconfig " clean boot " per norton web site instructions . i kept running into " blue screen death " previous installs when i would get actual install norton av . each time i would uninstall program more . but all help came symantec ( norton ) website . it now working fine . added : my personal preference not use software firewalls . i use router nat hardware firewall . ( it only blocks unauthorized incoming malware ) software firewalls try tell you everything leaving your computer generally you either become paranoid or just shut thing off . they intended look malware behavior . antivirus programs look malware signature . only advantage finding malware behavior if computer attacked first day or two malware existence . if one antivirus program it eventually ( within few days ) find problem software firewall trying tell someone . ( assuming they haven't given up yet too many cries wolf ) . so only software firewall i ( microsoft os firewall ) turned off thus i haven't same problem others report . practice i sent junk email directly trash avoid weird websites . so far no problems malware .	1

i don't write reviews often but this product so great i share my thoughts it . i bought this product because i going back graduate school(mechanical engineering so please excuse my grammar ) i wanted extra boost brain power . i using this product just everyday weeks now results very apparent . i noticed two obvious improvements myself . first , i now navigate city ease . i always knew my short term memory limiting factor my navigation abilities . before i'd always forget where i came , left or right , what street im , etc . i always people correct me . now i am one leading its not because i am paying more attention . without directly thinking my orientation i just know where orient myself(my gf would always correct me , but now im correcting her ) . second obvious improvement my improved speech listening abilities . i'd always trouble fumbling my speech understanding people . but now i feel i think what say more quickly clearly . i doing many puzzles this past summer combination brain builder really changed my life . i think more clearly i think " better " now . hard explain but " fog lifted " . everything easier now whether its putting something together or understanding environment around me . also my iq scores appear shoot up really high but thats up debate . i just want say what great product this i highly recommend it anyone . im sure when i start school this fall i'll see leap my abilities . jaso	1

i purchased this program simply encarta 2007 . i amazed all wonderful features microsoft put into package . i feel anyone school or not would find this program useful tool your daily life . enjoy it .	1
i initially purchased creator 9 same thing this software , but only thing it didnt hang my computer when it came down burn dvd . this software pretty much easy use , comes two ( bibles ) manuals , plenty information there creat some good videos . i recommend buying this or you always buy creator 9 it crash your system then spend few days trying review other products out there gotten good reviews such this one . you happy videos you make . you make video containing still images ( pictures ) , video camcorder camera or your computer , add text movies , add background music , its awesome . i must say again it wont hang your system . please get it , your family yourself wont disappointed .	1
our photo video editing softwares both very basic " old " , so we decided upgrade couple months ago . after reading many reviews different bundles , we decided get adobe photoshop elements 5.0 premiere elements 3.0 bundle . we've played around premiere elements bit , it really awesome . much better than pinnacle studio 8 we before . all basic functions easy use very intuitive , though we haven't gone figured out more advanced features yet . photoshop elements wonderful tool , well . we recently scan lot old pictures ( 20+ year old b/w photographs ) . they needed lot touching up , elements 5.0 worked wonderfully . i could adjust lighting sharpening , fix colors scratches , pictures turned out amazing . you'd never able tell they scanned images such old photographs . program also very intuitive . i could all things i wanted without read manual . course , i'm still just touching surface what all possible , i plan reading manual studying program more detail once i time so , but what i need right now , it easy use good job . there only two things i comment i don't like adobe bundle , they reason why i'm giving 4 stars instead 5.1 . stated minimum requirements this bundle 512mb ram . that what we our computer , while program worked , it so painfully slow it wasn't feasible really use it . we ended up upgrading 1gb , it working great since . so if you less than 1gb ram , make sure you upgrade before getting this software ! 2 . red-eye fix photoshop elements , or lack thereof . there auto red-eye fix , but it doesn't work very well . it finds red eyes all kinds places , just not where they actually . sometimes it covers half face , sometimes only half eye , etc . etc . etc . there option manually show program where red eye , but it still doesn't work right . maybe there trick i haven't found out yet , but right now , i usually give fix tool shot , if it doesn't work i take picture back into my old editing software fix red eye there . i'm really very disappointed this , fixing red eyes something you quite frequently when editing pictures . overall , software very easy fun work , even amateur like me . :o ) if adobe adjust minimum requirements recommendation fix red-eye fix tool , it going definitely deserve 5 points	1

i purchased this bible study set use my palm lifedrive . it works perfectly this device . truly , it exactly what i wanted . it should noted niv bible - other translations set - obscure god name ( yhwh ) . this makes it easy mainstream nominal christians attribute jesus almighty god - instead simply only begotten son almighty god . but translations otherwise rather good - tools offered this software set make it well worth money . after all , god judge hearts intentions rather than technical errors man trying understand him . jesus preached love even our enemies rather than legalistic jargon . it would great if set included interlinear ( word word translation ) both old new testaments . would very great addition ; but it would doubled cost . if such becomes available i gladly pay price	1
i really like this program . i purchased three different bible programs my pda this one far best three .	1

i've using norton antivirus 2002 annual updates patches forever norton internet security 2003 . now it time renewal norton antivirus , i thought i switch trend micro internet secuirty 2005 after all glowing wins it received certain mainstream computer magazines . i like norton 2002 but it memory resident hog taskmanager considering i running p3 500 laptop 196mb winxp pro , resources valuable . also newer norton antivirus version hit miss . after also reading reviews amazon , i took plunge trend micro . my review this product best summarize it relations norton antivirus 2002 ( updated ) . pros trend micro 2005:1 . fastest virus scan i've seen . i not find any virus my system yet whereas norton would fail . 01% time ( i.e. one stalling virus every year ) . 2 . check incoming outgoing mail like norton3 . scan selected files i chose just like norton4 . alert block virus threats5 . monitor nearby wifi connection6 . $25 mail rebate making price net $15 . ( it 2 months since i've mailed it not received it yet ) . 7 . uses 10mb system background resources versus norton 30mb . cons against trend micro 2005:1 . very annoying auto-virus update every day i log internet . i only 56k connection updating takes 5 minutes . i'm not trying save internet but everyday update may bit too much so i would prefer preference setting i choose myself . norton not annoying . 2 . wifi network , trend micro firewall failed 5 gibson research shields up test . ports open . norton internet firewall close all major holes except non-critical ones which wasn't big worry . i ended up disabling trend micro firewall using norton firewall instead it full software much better analysis deeper protection . 3 . anti-spam data protection subpar i got advertisements pop-up certain websites like west cost major newspaper . using norton firewall stops them dead ; never seen them again . 4 . still waiting rebate . overall , i think using trendmicro internet security 2005 it fast virus check separate norton internet firewall ideal combo me . it own merit , trend micro would perfect only if ram other resources low case my laptop but i wouldn't mind using norton if i plentiful more ram .	1

over all i am very happy product . it paid itself this short time just making happy birthday cards . i am not totally happy product i am not sure if i would buy it again . product well worth money you paying but their few things which i am not happy : 1 . even though product gives you cd which contain art project models their more art projects internet . access these art projects you need go internet which not problem . what problem if you want get this site lot other people site already you may not able get site . if you cannot get site you cannot finish your project . you put it away until some other time when you get site . this frustrating annoying . it makes you want take entire program through it out window buy brand . 2 . other thing i not happy , i given coupon , box , 1 year membership " million image club " get into this club you fill out some paperwork submit it internet . after it reviewed you then sent pass word , over internet , allows you go site . well , i filled out all paperwork , sent it over internet , required , but not sent password . well , i tried find some one talk this but ran into brick wall after spending lot time directed one site only end up no answer problem . it seems broderbund not control product but " encore " . you receive almost no help all " encore " . only place get help forum which couldn't give reasonable answer what i should . so , i am now not getting access " million image club " , tell you truth , i don't really care . when you finally get site you hundreds images models choose . you really don't need million more .	1
i chose office ultimate 2007 it seemed not only everything i could possibly need run business , but also easy functionality would keep me pulling my hair out because software or design issues . ultimate 2007 certainly doesn't disappoint ! - set up fairly easy : two disks came package . disk one contains most software disk two contains applications guarantee you owner software right all accounting key business functions . - ribbon technology removes old " hunt find " menu method ( although those us took time memorize learn location every buttom drop-down it take day or two get used new set up ) . - integration web other programs virtually seemless . - excel no longer chore it once because above mentioned ribbon . - accounting software included . - ink crossword . i'm not one games my business pc , but anyone likes doodle or zone out crosswords , ultimate lives up its name including art program designed pen users excellent crosswords . - onenote . i like post-its ( perhaps little too much * *) always used post-it note software my business computer keep notes . i used onenote 2003 sparingly because i simply found post-it note software easier use my desktop , but ... my tablet pc one note 2007 added new dimension my notetaking i feel work well my business : earlier mentioned web application integration handwriting text functionality . i may still use post-it now then quick notes or perhaps windows " stickys , " but long note pages , pasting images other web info , pen paper note taking makes this product invaluable . - word . what i say ? this my primary software tool i use it tablet pc . 2007 applications made my computer type . i easily click formatting tools touch my wacom pen i don't stop mid-thought make change or wait until i finish document then make my edits . - powerpoint , publisher , access , groove , infopath et cetera ( also included ): i am still delving into these , but they appear all perks other programs . so , i any dislikes ? 1 . ink program doesn't respond my wacom pen well windows journal or microsoft onenote . it also doesn't easy use tools within software . since it " extra " not my primary desktop publishing , design , or art tool - i'll probably remove it some point my tablet . 2 . microsoft not include instruction manual or reference book this program . result , after installation first disk microsoft statement all my programs installed , i couldn't find my accounting software , no idea accounting software second disk ( second disk , when loaded , doesn't mention software disk until after software installation complete instead mentions other business applications ) , wasted over hour trying find it . also , i'm " hands " person although i access internet whenever i need it , i enjoy actual book my hands time-to-time while learning . ultimate made enough simplicity manual isn't really necessary ( i.e. most questions answered " help " window ) , but ... hefty price tag , i don't think it would too much ask microsoft include basic " this how you install programs this what expect " booklet . also note : athough microsoft , through their downloads e-mail updates , provided " getting started " tab " how-to " each major software applications , tabs added " after fact " many you might find yourselves frustrated lack upfront instructions how use software . beside those few quirks , i fully stand behind my 5 star rating this product purchasing this product through amazon ( i.e. amazon pricing less than big boy retailers or online vendors ) . shipping turnaround super saver : 2 days .	1

i just used this program make wills healthcare directives my wife me . i book-cd version . i recommend it over just cd , because it better financial deal , you not read pdf online or print it out . here some features i thought worth noting : * program divides document into sections shows you list those sections , indicating which sections you . you resume interview beginning any section make changes point . * after doing one , you go file menu save spouse . this creates copy spouses names interchanged . then you go through interview make any needed changes . * process answering questions , program accumulates names people you mention into editable contact list . after you mention someone once , next time you need them you simply select them list . this handy when doing healthcare directive , which needs show contact information , if you already entered information when doing . it also handy if you decide redo portions either document . when working one family member document , you import contacts another document . * program not appear provide option list two or more alternate executors serve one time order named . only way list two or more alternate executors two or more them serve together . this ironic , since program recommends only one executor time . although i wanted name my wife , children , then siblings alternate executors , i decided accept just my wife son executor alternate . if all us die auto accident while taking trip together , then there hopefully time probate court name executor . it would just more expedient one already named . * i contacted customer support asking them enhance program add option list two or more alternate executors serve one time order named . response stated why they chose omit option ( " editors choose limit number fields beneficiaries executors prevent program becoming unwieldy " ) some options ( export document add language or return program ) . i disappointed they not embrace my suggestion ( i disagreed it would make program too unwieldy , since they already allow you list multiple beneficiaries executors serve together same time ) , but i liked i received prompt response indicated they read my note knew what i talking , they gave honest , direct answer . * end interview you review document it print . you then print it directly printer , or export it plain text or rtf . exporting rtf handy if you need change document ( they advise against changing it ) or print it somewhere else . however , rtf not identical printing directly . i noticed two differences . ( 1 ) pagination different , explained program , getting pagination right important legal reasons . ( 2 ) footer always different : directly printed copy says how many total pages , whereas rtf one not . if you cannot print directly printer , i recommend printing pdf maintain pagination other features . if you not way create pdf , get free pdf writer ( search term ) . when you print document pdf , print it prepress so you embed fonts .	1

this software wonderful ! i trying find good program scrapbook digitally many years . i've tried broderbund ( sp ? ) whose interface too clumsy , nova which rather difficult times ( many things you can't ) now this . when i first took this out package installed it i thought i made wrong decision this software since there very , very few backgrounds , templates or embellishements even when i opened xtras cds came this . i truly not feel xtras cds worth purchasing since there very few things them . but then i found tutorials included cd watched one making collages . i didn't get halfway through video - i figured out how it . i now created some best scrapbook pages i've ever made . within hours i beautiful collage/letter send my holiday cards . my husband first impression heartfelt " it lovely " . what so throughly convinced me abilities this software i take any image make it background , i create manipulate text almost any way i want , i've able create my own embellishments well using downloaded embellishments websites sell it ( . png format ) . i feel like i no limitations what i now . i imagine this software not sophistacated adobe illustrator , but then it probably isn't complicated use ( what i remember program rather steep learning curve ) . you also use eyedropper tool " pick up " any color any picture , background , or element ( read " anything " ) program . i able take background colors make embellishments matched ! i take color one my pictues make background matches . you also remove backgrounds photos - it takes bit time , but area around image transparent - this functionality many uses . you also save your files many different formats including . jpg file sharing , etc . there so many more features i couldn't possibly list them here , nor would you want me too ( too much time ) . if you only use premade templates don't feel ready venture out your own yet this software may not you unless you find website sells templates this software . you could start something like nova scrapbook factory deluxe 3.0 , which i liked , when you start becoming really frustrated its limiations it may time move up this program . you may also want read book digital scrapbooking give you ideas alert you possibilities . great thing this program it isn't just scrapbooking . you all your photo manipulation it . i always liked paint shop pro so much i haven't able afford upgrade my copy since version 6 , but i kept using version . i'm so glad i got version 10 it very user friendly too . but please know version 10 ( which comes this package ) not most recent version . version 11 out now . if you don't want/need xtras cds come this package you may want just buy most recent version buy some embellishements website makes . png files ( portable network graphics format ) or make your own . i hope you much fun this software i am . i highly recommend training videos cd - they really help	1

i bought this package because i wanted good , high-compression universally accessible documents images my personal web page . ( google werbos ) . finally , after zillions googles compression technology trying many other things ( see my other reviews ) , i found something really , really works well , highly flexible controllable way ! what relief ! much better than acrobat 6.0 , other packages i tried reviewed . key capability lies " save " command , which includes " optimized pdf " one file types . " settings " there gives you power choose jbig2 jpeg2000 compression , very best formats black white or color scanned images or papers . course , pdf , they easy anyone read . example : two weeks ago , world top empirical nuclear physicist , japan , sent me set 24 1-meg jpegs 24-page paper . nothing i would read it , except microsoft digital image , which let me fix pages crop them ; adobe 6.0 , they ended up readable 14 meg document . no better . i printed it out work , scanned result 400 dpi good modern copier/scanner . it ended up 5 megabytes . ( copier modern " intelligent " . ) then , home , adobe 6 , it wouldoptimize it pdf version 6 , nice 2.6 megabyte file . today , i got itto 940 ( better quality , eye)in acrobat 8.0 , controllablepredictable way . i previously tried many , many other options ( including lots microsoft programs , all options ) . if i understand what i seen ... i could used acrobat 8.0 directly , without all printout scan nonsense ! direct control " save " command gets rid need all . what more , i just reduced 3.5 meg file ( best previous material ) 1.02 megs . ( best i recall , i used cvision before only got file 1.5 -2 megs . acrobat 8.0 seems doing much better . ) if you google lot compression comparisons , you see some small advantage cvision over older versions adobe image capture acrobat . but that misleading . acrobat 6.0 , i couldn't get better compression . ( maybe if i phd adobe , i could , but i tried hard .. ) . 8.0 , it easy . results better than cvision now , so far i tell . i certainly see no value all new xps formats microsoft touting , vista , now something so much better available . one caveat : published benchmarks say djvu format may better yet . i not consider it , partly because cost , but more because everyone knows how get latest pdf reader but djvu might stop people going my web page . but if google books popularizes it , i might reconsider djvu . but then again ... knowing what lies behind djvu .. we might figure out something even better ... eventually ... maybe future pdf standards open !	1

if you're reading this . you want upgrade , your old computer windows xp professional edition here few things keep mind . first thing , you download service pack two windows update . so no need buy it integrated xp . these what i consider minimum system requirements : 256 mb ram . i found adequate more equals better . 500 mhz or higher . 7200 rpm hard drive help lot . if you're running windows millennium edition , or 98 upgrade now stability vastly improved . gone blue screens death . frequently asked question : windows xp pro better than home edition ? windows xp pro more high-end networking features most home users never miss or would even know missing . so most users windows home edition fine . they both based same code almost identical . if you're thinking upgrading windows 2000 , i , because i like gui interface better . but windows xp stable windows 2000 . so it your call . plug-and-play ability windows xp totally great ! windows xp default find most drivers video card sound cards , network cards , etc . such bonus gone days search cds drivers . i recommend upgrading windows xp professional or home edition . it great operating system some fun get it	1

my kids ( 6 8 ) learning so much fritz chesster 2 !! fact , my 6 year old daughter started winning few games their local chess club after graduating this game ( fritz chesster 1 ) . today i decided play them ( since they don't like play against each other - they're still working " good sportsmanship " thing ) , i let them team up against me . i viewing this opportunity help them think ahead , predict moves , protect their pieces . however , i one who learned !! they surprised me again again reciting strategies ( move your bishops knights out , save your queen real battle , don't move your pawns willy nilly , break your oponnent wall , etc ... ) they learned this game . they also knew relative value pieces , but could see advantages making uneven swaps sometimes . example , they shocked me sacrificing bishop pawn order open hole my wall , which they later exploited checkmate my king . this strategy even 1 month ago would unthinkable them . anyway , i defer other more experienced chess players computer users who made specific comments graphics , dialogue , strategies . i am sure some point , my kids move beyond this game what it offer . but now i couldn't happier chesster fritz games ! my kids absolutely love playing computer games really learning play chess - not just " computer chess " , but chess lets them beat other kids chess club - not mention me . i think i'm going go demand rematch :)	1

i purchased this game my 3 year old who already reads little knows her numbers well . i hoped this game would help her learn addition . she loves play it , but several games require hand coordination beyond her ability ( hand cart one particular , noted reviewer ) , catching bubbles . it frustrating me because she knew proper answer but could not " execute " because her movements too slow . over time , she improved enough play most games level one . game very engaging ang graphics well-done , but educational part under-emphasized . game " teaches " addition involves frogs jumping lily-pads my daughter so focused frogs addition lesson hardly noticed	1
my 4 year old son received this christmas present . he really enjoyed playing it so far . he most activities without help . there one part where you ride cart down mountain click buttons duck or jump , which i think pretty hard little ones ( it actually took me couple tries make it down mountain ) . there many different learning activities : matching , memory , shapes , size , etc . we not any problems loading game our computer reviewer . we new dell computer running windows xp	1
rosetta stone spanish third major spanish course i am buying . i comtpleted all spanish lessons pimsleur series , also completed learning spanish like crazy level one two . i am one those rare latinas not learn spanish my parents . my mexican parents felt it would easier " assimilate " if i only spoke english . after going my grandparents ' home holidays only one there not speak spanish , after latino strangers speak me spanish then look me astonishment when i struggled just say " no , hablo espanol , " i felt it time me learn how speak my language . first course i used pimsleur spanish . compared rosetta stone i must say i learned much more vocabulary rosetta stone software . but i recommend pimsleur over rosetta stone , especially complete beginner . because its easy teaching method , my opinion pimsleur even better than lslc someone no experience whatsoever speaking spanish . pimsluer goes very slow pace . but if you already learned some spanish your own or high school or college , then you probably skip pismleur go straight lslc . or if you type person believes learning foreign language should more like hurdle than marathon you'll probably want go learning spanish like crazy . lslc covers lot more spanish words grammar than pimsleur moves quicker pace . so where rosetta stone fit ? i would say use rosetta stone after you completed above courses . it difficult really learn how speak spanish this software alone because you only looking pictures repeating phrases you hear . you never really learn how think spanish create your own sentences . so why am i still giving it 4 stars ? because if you already know how speak some spanish course you intermediate level then you add plenty more spanish words your vocabulary using rosetta stone software . one negative this course method tedious because software interface " antiquated " photos 1980s . sound quality not clear pimsleur or learning spanish like crazy . but if you stick it out through drudgery , you surprised how many spanish words you learned this software . but i think pimsleur better job teaching me concepts than this software doing . teaching me concepts , i really retained material understanding concepts , i am able take my own thoughts form sentences . something i would not able if i used this course alone . negative this course , unlike other two courses i mentioned , you use rosetta stone while sitting computer . difficult me because i am very busy classes , work my personal life . i use pimsleur or lslc my mp3 player not worry sitting computer . besides limited vocabulary slow teaching method , only downside pimsleur it not teach same spanish words most commonly used mexicans other latinos regular conversation . pimsleur spanish very formal spanish . we say " mucho gusto " like lslc teaches , pimsleur teaches " encantado . " our overly " macho " culture if man responds " encantado " many latinos may get wrong impression him . it not something i am proud say my ( latino ) culture , but it true . pimsleur not warn male student if you say " encantado " some latinos they may get wrong impression speaker . learning spanish like crazy taught me useful practical spanish i use communicate my spanish speaking friends family . when i tell people i learned speak spanish adult not home child , many them not believe me . i think they find it incredible two reasons : one , my accent really sounds like native speaker using lslc . two , i learned real conversational spanish lslc . i learned words phrases spanish speakers actually use when speaking each other . pimsleur taught me spanish author course thought i should speak , not spanish latinos really speak . one positive things separates lslc course others . so what order would i rate three terms ease teaching method : 1 . pimsleur spanish 2 . learning spanish like crazy 3 . rosetta stone spanish but terms teaching real conversational spanish teaching real latin american accent , i rate them follows : 1 . learning spanish like crazy 2 . pimsleur spanish 3 . rosetta stone spanish	1
it relief me able keep upgrade word excel , get virtual pc ( access ) well . i used them lot my pc few years ago , when i first switched mac , couldn't find software what they . i no trouble installing upgrade my imac g5 , nor i trouble installing virtual pc . only thing disappointing i couldn't find out whether accessing internet virtual pc would open me up pc-type viruses , or if mac unix system would protect me there , too . i continue disappointed mac version this software not rich pc version . but upgrade itself worked well what it meant	1

i came across magix audio cleaning lab 4 years ago . once i got hang it , i really liked it . however , i kept wondering if there better programs out there . i mean , really , how good it $39 , right ? i recently paid $75 sony famed sound forge studio ( which sound forge program minus various some features ) . i spent lot time sound forge studio , working perfect my transfer some private music recordings cassette cd . i happy what i able accomplish sound forge . least i thought i happy . i compared my work sound forge studio same cassette transfer i magix audio cleaning lab 10 ( previous iteration this software ) . guess what ? i liked magix work much better . so , i immediately purchased audio cleaning lab 11 unintalled sony sound forge studeio my computer . magix could charge $150 this software i would buy it second . your going take time carefully read through full manual get most out this software - but it worth effort . this program work software costing 3 times much .	1

i aware naturallyspeaking over 15 years . we initially utilized this software assist people severe disabilities such cerebral palsy able basic commands understood . more recently five years ago i bought edition 4.0 . i found it frustrating when ever there any background noise so i basically quit using it . when i saw 8.0 advertised voice recognition software specifically small business atmosphere , i thought i would try it one more time . slow typist it truly changed my life better . only 45 minutes required set up speech-recognition files when occasional mistakes occur during dictation if you correct those change those right time , i never see same misunderstanding happening again . i recommended it two friends who buying it . it really allow you sit back your chair relax , drink your coffee dictate reports , answer e-mail or whenever it you might need . i can't think any $70 expenditure given me so much back such short time . i almost always my headset when i'm front computer because anything involves typing or entering data i used dragondictate	1

if you serious learning spanish this software isn't enough . you need purchase spanish-english dictionary - i like barron spanish dictionary because it came free down loadable software version - spanish audio series such pimsleur or learning spanish like crazy ( lslc ) . verb conjugation book good idea too , i like big red book 555 spanish verbs . finally , just like back day , you should either buy flashcards or create your own build up your vocabulary when you can't stand look computer monitor even one second longer . now here part puzzle rosetta stone help you : it very repetitive requires interaction picture/word association . i found this burns words into my mind photos help me recall word or phrase . rosetta stone also help you reading comprehension well spelling - long you use all lesson plans resist temptation just fun parts . but speech recognition feature not good teaching you speak spanish high quality audio series such pimsleur or lslc . advantage speech recognition you slow down word or phrase spoken . so if you want slow down word " mujer " you hear how native speaker uses hard sound slight roll last ; it great pronunciation but not effective learning how handle yourself conversation . summary , rosetta stone not one stop shop . it isn't mobile audio series your ipod . it isn't going make learning spanish thoughtless easy task . i recommend you buy this software use it but understand you paying $500 primarily word/picture association ability analyze your pronunciation individual words phrases . also , keep your spanish dictionary handy alleviate any confusion . whole childlike learning approach good , but your adult skills definitely help speed up process .	1

if you're looking create next doom 3 or half-life 2 , then i can't really recommend this program . if you want make advanced fps game , or simple pong game , then i recommend dark basic . fact , dark basic professional probably capable creating any kind game you come up . catch ? you program it yourself , all scratch . dark basic makes manipulating 3d data extremely easy , but it not game creation package which lets you click create . if you determined enough , it easy learn all dark basic commands , half programming game logic . dark basic hardly limit you , give you capabilities probably impossibly hard you use c++ . end result creating game scratch results tremendous sense satisfaction , especially when you share it friends family . although previous versions dark basic professional some hardly crippling bugs , most them eliminated , release upgrade 6.0 , dbpro very stable development engine . overall , i totally recommend this anyone who wants create game , but determined enough learn how	1

you probably read 50/50 reviews this software . used older poser software ... one thing i am fan miki terai yuki ... japanese virtual beauties if you fan japanese styled video games character designs , fact e-frontier now company behind poser 6 , i'm so stoked . granted , software bundles ( best buy it bundled other cool software ) , there free software out called daz3d . daz3d content creators make stuff daz3d poser vice versa but no matter if you go free program or poser 6 , result same ... expect pay money content . i highly recommend getting book " pratical poser 6 " because it very , very informative unlike manual . next thing ... before you buy ... mosey down daz3d.com, contentparadise.com, renderosity.com ask yourself , you afford buy content . content costs anywhere free over $100+ . good stuff costs money ... maybe not lot but it add up . next thing know after you buy content , due how hair or clothing conforms body ( or how it placed ) , they not organized . make matters worse names creators called their work long window selections ( figure , pose , hair , prop , etc . ) get cut off so , it becomes bit choir go back forth certain folders . but i got used it thing .... all developers content helpful . content paradise great place buy your content well creators websites well . there lot trial error i wish there more undos ... because really , although there undo ... you mess up ... you can't just undo ... you start over your your save file ( hopefully you saved ) . nevertheless , stuff i able create poser wonderful . i say i spent lot not just poser bundle but content . it adds up quickly !!! so , consider benefits you . although i love characters daz3d ever popular foxhair , i'm more fan poser but still expect buying content dax3d use poser .	1

compared fp 2000 earlier versions , it offered some major improvements , even letting one code ( gasp ) php live preview - it highly configurable , easily tied into sharepoint ( well , i think intent ) . it quite evolution , moving beyond fp2000 , some fairly advanced features - while still retaining " entry level , small business learnable " functionality ( albeit cookie cutter designs ) previous versions . i surprised find it even offered options strip out all code hinted this site made frontpage ( odd change , knowing ms ) , but also offered other code functions , some par dreamweaver - but not mistake this dreamweaver , even first mx version . it still aimed microsoft only - you really dig tweak configure it anything else ( e.g , php , cold fusion ) - but it offer some major improvements flexibility over previous versions . mostly good , some horribly bad . good - able tweak it dozens standards ' compliance , sec . 508 , xml'ish stuff , whatever . default these things not set up , so it take some learning . what annoyed ( freaked me out ) while it easily allowed desktop development access , create database driven sites - database remain public folder - ok , i suppose if you're using it only intranet . i believe point code access , then mod it slightly interact sql server - but most folks probaby not use it way - knowing history " fire forget " ease use frontpage ... anyhow , i'd call this para-professional version . it way more flexibility functionality than any version frontpage , ever . it also going bye-bye . there not frontpage 2007 , due switch expression web ( which retains some fp functionality , but " friendly " pesky " bots " gone ) . no more email bots , whatever bots - gotta learn how roll your own .	1
given my limited knowledge computer science programming i felt frontpage really big help . i able get website up running 2 weeks which i think pretty good all things considering . i didn't realize though frontpage isn't cureall making website really . primarily only web design i.e. if you want make website e-commerce query searches inventory database like , you're gonna need bring professional programmers any event program asp or php . but far web design goes frontpage take novice long way .	1

it basic job well . calibration runs smoothly accurately . hardware looks feels solid . my two completely different brand , size age crt monitors ended up exactly same colors sitting side side . user interface merely adequate . pop up help instructions better than many i seen . you need know already how calibration buttons your monitors work ( hardwired buttons monitor , not software ) . order make any edits you must run entire time consuming calibration over . sometimes you use " back " within calibration , sometimes you must start over . also separate " profile chooser " utility software , not add or delete profile feature - even if it profile created saved calibration software earlier . you see it windows display properties , but it may not appear profile chooser list . dual monitors one obvious reason choose pro over plus version . yes , it dual monitors , but asterisk . it create separate profiles , but only apply correct profiles automatically startup both monitors if you two separate video cards . if you single video card dual outputs , it load same profile ( last one you created ) both monitors startup . this quirk documented readme file installation disk ( blames windows problem ) , but this limitation appears nowhere advertising material , catalogs , or box . fortunately there work around ( not documented ) least my particular video card running xp . after windows opens , you run profile chooser then choose correct profile each monitor . you may use windows display properties settings specify default profile rerun calibration get profiles you want appear profile chooser select correct profile default . once it all set up , running profile chooser four five click procedure , but you must rememeber check it before using any application uses color profiles . check it after you open application . i've them change after opening photoshop - though not every time .	1

i yet make card this software , but choice ... i prefer photo cards , find it easier make outside card my canon photo software , inside digital image . i love stationery section this , however ... lots choices paper designs , it very easy use . i just can't figure out how make text larger , if you . when you're typing up your letter , it large text ; when you print your letter it small text . making envelope easy , too ... it only easy software i ! only , i go my control panel click my canon printer properties change paper type envelope . hallmark software doesn't allow this -- least not envelopes directly follow stationery printing , although it allows it when printing your letter . if i don't change canon envelope , i'm left ink tracks my envelopes . ( there separate envelope category , however , i haven't used . maybe one brings up printer properties . ) there loads fun projects this software , it very colorful software . installation ... mine nightmare . disc 1 only one would download . other two just froze my pc . i discovered i changing discs too quick . if i waited least few minutes changing discs it installed fine . i almost gave up it , however , but am glad i didn't	1

any e-dictionary give you definitions course , but what i especially like this one it lightning fast . also , when definition contains illustration it indicated icon which you double click view ( which comes up instanteously seperate window ) . this dictionary also allows you search word different criteria other than just its definitions : rhymes , homophones , date , author quoted , definition contains ... etc , etc . one note installation : make sure you temporarily disable active virus software ( it wouldn't hurt same those other programs right side task bar )	1

how quickly people forget pain managing raw images just operating system copy photoshop . thanks aperture ( its subsequent imitators ) managing ( interacting ) huge raw libraries becomes invisible easy . i specifically like full-screen mode , which puts images front center . likewise , loupe tool lets you check focus image without taking focus ( no pun intended ) away photography . you make changes images without convert them , then edit them , then hit save-as everytime you new idea . aperture completely non-destructive . raw image loaded adjustments it tracked seperately ( yet seamlessly ) so you never worry losing your master . there lot more app beyond these things , which what makes it such amazing piece software . its digital slr best friend	1

if you're one those people like me , who hang older version application waiting right time , now time upgrade . you won't disappointed . just ask editors both pc magazine c|net which awarded this version their editor choice award . once again adobe listened its loyal customer base . proof new version illustrator . many our requests answered latest version including some we didn't even think . i happy find out even new features , adobe not altered illustrator previous palettes or keyboard commands . there nothing worse than shortcut or command memorized years then it gets changed new version . no fear here ! first all , i want say i am really impressed live trace live paint features , especially when used together . we all know sometimes ideas hit us when we least expect it away our beloved computer . we end up drawing it out napkin , paper towel or unused envelope our glove compartment . normally , once you get back your computer you try redraw your graphic using illustrator which takes both time effort --- not any more . take your napkin masterpiece your scanner scan it . once image scanned , then fun begins . once image scanned brought into illustrator cs2 , use live trace feature actually trace your drawing . this feature actually turns drawing into live trace object easy manipulation . after applying some blurring needed , your traced image cleared up . then , convert your live trace object into live paint object using new control palette . i like live paint tool also because it reminds me working photoshop . once you've converted live paint object , you easily use pen other tools modify any points your liking . live paint also feature called gap detector which prevents paint going over into other sections because break line . this handy feature keeps you fix overspill later . when object outlines finalized , use live paint feature easily fill any region color . voila ! you . go napkin art matter minutes . concern many us years fact while illustrator keep getting better newer features , it also mean more more palettes . sometimes it became little unmanageable . however , pros adobe recognized this problem applied solution - control palette . this new palette sits top screen . first , it acts object inspector providing information . secondly , ( more importantly ) , control palette provides easy access fill stroke dropdown menus , brush shape , opacity , style . no longer you fumble through your palette get these frequently used features . if you fans adobe other creative suite 2 software , you pleased learn control palette apart their new makeover too . here some more new additions changes illustrator : * like photoshop , illustrator cs2 now supports custom workspaces . you display only palettes you need any time . you also able access or save any workspace any time or use workspace templates . * adobe improved swatch color integration . now , working other creative suite 2 programs seamless . * isolation mode feature allows you double-click group move edit internal objects without search through layers palette . * cs2 now supports all latest wacom tablets . it now provides brush support new wacom 6d art pen adds new dimension illustrator calligraphic scatter brushes * adobe bridge integration now part illustrator cs2 . bridge allows you easily manage images through thumbnails better workflow . * macromedia flash exports now available . you export both text objects flash files which result smaller file size easier incorporation into web projects . * you now open photoshop files layer comps within illustrator . this new feature allows you view many versions layout one time , just you photoshop * custom stroke placement new addition illustrator . you now place strokes outside , inside or center path . * underline strikethrough two over 170 new type enhancements . * these few new features ! $169 upgrade cost well worth money , just live trace live paint features alone . however , you get so much more new illustrator cs2 . upgrade now completely satisfied . if you haven't purchased vector graphics program , get illustrator , especially if you already owner version photoshop . this new version illustrator even looks more like familiar photoshop layout . loren elksgroup manager , d-mag.org	1

i'm interior designer interior designer 7.0 . it easy learn , but i already used similar programs i know cad , but you don't need any cad experience use this program . materials render well , but library furniture accessories fairly limited . example i creating game room client only one style pool table choose no accessory items such pool sticks , balls or wall racks . i've figured out some workarounds such using round millwork items sinking them into pool table look like balls . bed styles also very limited . i've downloaded all their bonus furniture , but it still lacking . fabric options also fairly limited , but sure scroll down past " fabric " find category " bhg fabric " . colors , scroll down past " colors " benjamin moore or download bonus sherwin williams colors . also best plants " xfrog " category . save time set your render quality low fast renderings , then change it back high place your accessories . program good job allowing you import your own images textures . show image tv screen , define it new texture your custom library width set 0 ( so it doesn't repeat image ) . overall i like program i just need figure out how get more furniture accessories	1

it very easy go wrong this product . it brought out relatively simple form you just know going grow . it not photoshop or even photoshop like . it isn't what you use fix picture ( though you sure ) . something happened . film going away . people used pay film images anything totally black whiteout maybe 1 good image out 24 ? now we preview shoot freebies digital . lots lots pictures . some us shoot over 1000 images one outing . ohhhh , but it gets more hairy than . now digital cameras taking images good print film . - if you use original data camera ( raw form called raw data ) rather than automatically interpreted shrunk ( jpeg ) version , you might even get paid money what you take . but those unshrunk raw files big ? yes . so how you zip through 1000 raw data files sort them into aunty em , lion , scare crow , oz ... or make slide show , or print certain ones or make contact sheets . brighten 30 time or boost contrast this bunch - fast . lightroom	1

i got this request christmas gift last year , m-audio keystation 61es keyboard . combination two works really nicely my powermac . i didn't really start going through lessons until week ago due shoulder surgery i beginning year , but so far so good . record , i studied music 10 years when i younger , though not piano . while i still remember much earlier training ( particular , how read music ) there plenty new piano so i'm not feeling these early lessons too easy ( though they may slightly easier ) . i few complaints program . first , reviewer noted , you cannot turn down volume accompaniment / instructor . this makes it impossible me hear my own playing when going through lesson , even keystation volume cranked all way up . so what i play instructor audio once get idea , then play solo so i hear all my flubs faults ( also when i get it right ! ;-d ) . second , program seems slightly crash-prone running mac os 10.4 ( a.k.a. " tiger " ) . i've found it crash least once any given practice session , when i re-launch i'm right back where i started session . true , i just click right arrow until i get where i left off , but if i'd going half-hour managed get through several screens it little irritating . third , though not bug , how music displayed screen . reviewer noted , programmers / designers seemed feel 640 480 plenty resolution , but this means many songs you play cover multiple screens . " when saints go marching " took up 3 screens , which seemed ridiculous when i'm 1280 1024 monitor . yes , pages auto-turn you when you end one , but first time or two through song it very irritating i'm trying read ahead figure out what fingers need move next . but maybe most importantly , i'm finding this software , while it certainly teaches fundamentals playing well enough , still doesn't fully take place real , live instructor sitting there me . particular , i tell my hand position not completely right because when i play fingers my right hand ( especially my ring finger ) get sore rather quickly , like i'm straining muscles/tendons top fingers . i've got large long-fingered hands , even full-size keys keystation i find it hard get all five fingers seated keys without least two fingers curling quite bit . maybe this normal when you start playing piano , but it would nice someone there confirm whether i'm doing it ok . i'm certain live instructor would see anything i doing wrong right away help me correct it right then there . videos showing proper posture all well good , but program can't see me or tell me i posture problem . all it say i played wrong note or i held note too long / short . i'm hoping i'm not developing any other problems my technique , since i plan moving live instructor some point when my schedule opens up i've become certain i devote time serious practice . i'd hate develop some decent playing skills only find i start over because my core technique all wrong . so , five stars because generally good quality technical instruction , minus one star not able point out purely physical problems my playing . not program fault , but i can't give five stars something can't perfectly replace live teacher	1
i recently become more serious web page design . i looked other products tried them out . however , dreamweaver exceeded my expectations . i am not advanced user any means , so my rating might " new user bias " it . my first web site used wysiwyg editor similar frontpage . then , i downloaded 30 day trial dreamweaver redesigned site . productivity greatly increased interface very easy navigate , once you get used it . new web site far more impressive , user friendly , feature rich without cut productivity . learning dreamweaver pleasure . if you familiar web design , learning curve very nice . i making web pages within couple hours downloading trial . tutorials readily available help menu adobe web site . course , you always find good book here amazon . if price dreamweaver fit your budget you serious making impressive web sites , i highly recommend consideration	1

i find ad aware better than spybot which gets rec all popular magazines . why ? interface more sophisticated . spybot not very intuitive requires more clicks mouse what you want . ad aware more one-click solution . but worst thing spybot , during trial my client pc , it would not update . attempt update definitions file would result progress bar which stalled midway through . you could leave it there hours , process would never complete . this , fully functional broadband internet connection . after happened , i uninstalled spybot , then installed registered ad aware directly lavasoft . lavasoft baby first-rate program , important addition ad-watch which you must register use , effectively puts end spyware . diego , below , must confused . there never charge update program or download definitions . i used ad aware two years without paying it ( it free ) only registered get ad watch program protect my elderly parents nasty spyware which disabled their pcs . i read recently review ad-aware pc world . writer mentally retarded . he claimed , falsely , ad-aware possessed no real-time spyware blocker . what he doing comparing free version ad-aware pay versions programs like webroot . fair ? no . nevermind . " please discontinue my subscription pc world , because i insist upon intelligent articles , detested reviews influenced bribery . " i think there needs law where anyone who reviews anything should disclose how much they paid certain vendor . case pc world i would estimate mere $10 , 000 , but that enough buy writer daughter braces , isn't it ? if you drop $27 lavasoft you get real-time spyware blocker which works like charm . you take your copy share friends elderly parents , ho-ho-ho ! you find , however , pop-up interceptor overly aggressive can't used all time . it tends cause problems certain web sites . i recommend just using most critical protections . if you're curious , download free edition directly lavasoft . then if you like it , register get ad watch . i think you like i t.t he criminal organizations write distribute spyware bundled inside their games or utilities should prosecuted same virus writers , because their junk disables or reduces performance infected pcs . spyware no better than smashing my car windshield hammer . uninfecting pc potentially costs $100 up , requires few days down-time . i think this law enforcement matter , police should knocking door guilty corporations . executives made bad decisions should serve jail-time , same any vandal who caused millions dollars ( collectively ) property damage . reason major players pc marketplace silent spyware it driving lots new pc purchases . people find their old pc ( infected spyware ) isn't fast it used , they think solution buy new one . real solution install register ad aware . but non-technical person not know this , most people non-technical including many people i care . i am angry way computer scene today , how non-technical people getting shaft .	1
i work it , cable isp . i used swear norton products , until 2003 . after 2003 antivirus , their products junk , however only other mainstream security software out there pretty much mcafee ( which wretched , stinking garbage i've never known anyone who it not get virus ) , i considered it lesser two evils . my work we frequently refer people trend micro housecall , consensus amongst my colleagues seems it best job cleaning up infected systems those our customers whose service suspended due virus activity . i found dozens people recommending housecall scan over those norton , mcafee , even program our company partners provide our free customer security suite . upon finding out trend micro 30 day free trial , i decided give it shot . i think it great program , user friendly possible amount features it . it loads quickly isn't resource hog . i think it really cool you see mac id people connected your wireless network . bad reviews this program frustrated me . you can't fault product ' larger updates than norton ' ... i'd rather suite releasing more updates greater size than norton - how novel find security suite its job ! it not trend micro fault you live boonies use dial up . i don't think it fair give it 1 rating just because you particular type epilepsy where what sets you off ... if i am eating restaurant , somebody next me wearing perfume triggers migraine headache me ( also recognized medical condition ) , i don't give restaurant bad review . after all , food grea t.t he only thing i don't like if you trying change licence key version you machine , there isn't apparent way just change key ... so i took ten minutes uninstall reinstall program , then enter new key ( literally , i think it took less than 10 minutes ) . keep mind kiddies , installing any security suite infected pc or one scores junk left registry mcafee , norton ( or both - some people think if you install 2 it " protects you more " - so not true ) makes you much more likely experience problems install . i never problems uninstalling norton ( 5 pc i it ) installing pc cillin , even without deleting registry entries norton left behind . always security suite , it always best fresh install windows . overall , it runs quickly updates often almost every component you could want out suite . i personally think it best option out there - but keep mind , you get flu shot but it doesn't guarantee you're not going get flu , it just highly reduces likelyhood . it great program i think it cool they give you specialized area website manage licences get access personalized info based products you . also - norton charges 30+ bucks support . mcafee only online support . pc cillin free ( not i've ever call since i've never problem program ) . p.s. : person who reviewed broken english they couldn't log into yahoo mail , ten bucks says your security privacy settings ie ( only someone who uses yahoo mail would use internet explorer ) probably set " high " that why you can't log	1

this review might alittle hard product but i wasnt impressed . expecting something revolutionary instead lessons kind like going though high school again one big exception . they dont give you writen translation what every thing means . rossetta stone focuses pictures actual sounding out words spoken . program you presented picture italian narrator tells you what going or what picture . however what he saying not directly translated written words . its up you figure out what he saying based what you see pictures . so pretty much you not sure times which words spoken verbs or nouns . they their best single out verbs which they give you multiple pictures ppl performing same actions . however still its up you figure out . other than its great program . it forces you pronounce italian italian accent using pictures you see . you able write italian sentences using same technique ( still no english translation ) . i chose language i already knew try program out . if i true beginner ... i might hard time learning this language i would far not fluent it . thats sure	1

everyman photoshop cs2 reviewthe reason this called " everyman " review i'm less than expert . fact , if photoshop car , i'd one driving it cross-country first gear . i normally use photoshop creating web graphics or sexing up photos - no shifting required , other words . but photoshop way more than , so much so without it , most designers would curl up die . most us though , running full-bore image-editing app like driving ferrari back yard . i ought know : i've access software long time still don't know what all tools - latest version , adobe photoshop cs2 , even more . said , if you any kind visual project mind modicum talent , there hardly anything you can't . it may take while get rolling , but once you , you'll kill chance your very own copy . see what you ? photoshop cs2 available alone or part adobe creative suite 2 , which includes adobe illustrator cs2 , adobe indesign cs2 , version cue cs2 , adobe golive cs2 , adobe acrobat 7.0 professional premium edition . ( this reviewer slated receive full suite , but " only " photoshop component showed up . color me stupendously grateful regardless , course , but i won't addressing integration features this review . ) $599 standalone version , piracy always problem adobe , but company gone out its way save you yourself requiring activation -- not same thing registration -- within 30 days installation . past , you could buy app install it all your computers ( or any machine matter ) , but new version only works user primary secondary computers . frankly , details activation process left me confused . according adobe activation faq page ( my emphasis ): activation process supports installation two machines . adobe product license agreement allows primary user install product primary computer also home or laptop computer his or her use , provided two copies not used simultaneously . while activation process supports installing activating adobe software two machines , usage product second computer restricted user who licensed software . allowing others use second copy software violates product license agreement . call me dense , but i no idea what they mean not using both copies simultaneously . shortly before submitting this review , i photoshop cs2 running both my computers nothing blew up , nor anyone unpleasant bust down my door . apparently my wife isn't allowed use software tibook , according above . frankly , this absurd , i wish company lawyers would get life . but it may , installation process itself straightforward , although my 500 mhz tibook os 10.3 ( oldie but goodie ) required few hard slaps case above cd-rom drive before disk would mount . first thing i learned when launching new app usual , i coloring outside lines : mac os version 10.3.4 or later recommended maximum performance correct operation adobe photoshop cs2 . earlier version mac os detected . oops ! despite warning , official system requirements listed reviewer guide only call minimum mac os version 10.2.8 , i haven't seen any signs " incorrect " operation yet . true , installing photoshop my 400 mhz blue white g3 os 10.3 seems magically doubled boot time , but that it . if you don't 10.3.4 , i'd say go it anyway . those you older versions , there more than enough useful new features photoshop cs2 justify $149.99 upgrade cost . partial rundown includes following , few which i'll expand upon later : * adobe bridge ( file browser steroids )* vanishing point ( extraordinary plane-based visual perspective tool )* image warp ( turns flat images into shaped graphics )* reduce noise filter ( corrects jpeg compression artifacts more )* 32-bit high dynamic range ( hdr ) editing ( creates images " widest possible dynamic range " )* spot healing brush ( one-click retouching )* one-click red eye tool * optical lens correction * animation ( create animated gifs directly photoshop )* smart sharpen * enhanced 16-bit filter support * smart objects ( allow non-destructive scaling , rotation warping layers within photoshop cs2 )* multiple layer control ( select , align , group simultaneously move multiple layers )* multi-image camera raw ( um ... )* video preview ( preview your work firewire-connected monitor )* wysiwyg font menu ( you're gonna love this )* more color management options when printing * all-new pdf engine ( automatic optimization web viewing )* high capacity ram compatibility ( address 3.5 gb g5 )* expanded , integrated online servicessee what i mean ? adobe bridge , i probably shouldn't comment , since i've never used old file browser [ blush ] . but here what adobe say : acclaimed file browser evolved into its own application - adobe bridge . now , two applications work efficiently parallel - adobe bridge building thumbnails while you edit photoshop cs2 , or photoshop cs2 batch processing images while you continue work adobe bridge . adding essential new features photographers such multiple-file camera raw processing , enhanced ranking labeling , slideshow mode quick review your images , adobe bridge also integrates illustrator cs2 , indesign cs2 golive cs2 , bridging workflow across new creative suite 2 applications . i don't know file browser , but bridge rocks , i'm converted . instead locating particular image finder using column view , bridge i browse any folder my hard drive , see all photos once ( filmstrip view , below , hoot ) , open any or all them photoshop just click . just five minutes playing this opened my eyes , when skeptic like me gets all mushy , people should pay attention . vanishing point filter , completely new cs2 , rates whole review all itself . adobe explains it , " first you define perspective your image creating perspective grids , then you edit your image normally , let vanishing point take care adjusting your editing defined perspective . " what means real terms you things you never dreamed without doing hours work , like pasting " way cool " " yow ! " into image below . ( how i " hah ! " ? keep reading ... ) talk serious empowerment ! i've never even tried work this level , but now i . once you've defined planes ( grids ) your image , you drag objects into distance them still correct perspective . since perspective grids saved inside image ( or separate layer if you want ) , you return re-edit whatever placed them . edit perspective ? yup . you paint directly onto perspective planes stamp tool , make selections within them , whole lot more . this one extraordinary feature . add image warp mix , your inner package designer wake up hollering . adobe thoughtfully included full set presets common object shapes , you drag control points warp grid customize desired . ever wonder how your logo would look coffee mug or baseball cap ? image warp it covered . this what i used place " hah ! " text inside mexican pot , course , remember , i don't know what i'm doing - so power users ought able effect miracles . * * * there lot more talk , but we only one web site , i'm sure my mymac colleagues more say photoshop other cs2 applications . meanwhile , my other picks things thankful cs2 version ability make animated gifs right inside photoshop , spot healing brush removing unwanted pixels single click , multiple layer control , wysiwyg font menu . those you who import vector graphics illustrator ( i don't ) able start whole new religion smart objects , photographers love new camera raw format editing power . this incredibly powerful versatile application . if i santa claus or benevolent deity , i'd make sure every artist designer half ounce talent copy carry him- or herself promised land . it really good , although i say complexity overwhelming beginners . ( adobe help application best i've ever seen , however , provided tremendous assistance writing this review . ) i'd no hesitation whatsoever giving photoshop cs2 highest possible rating , except intuition app grown point where its sheer size multitude features , not mention price , bound limit expansion user base . personally , i'd like take digital carving knife photoshop create half dozen specialty image editing apps , but that not direction adobe going , especially after absorbing macromedia , who say i know better than them ? i also no love increasingly maddening anti-piracy copy protection measures employed industry , although adobe activation process gave me no trouble . it principle thing , i'm just old-fashioned when it comes trusting people . but if you get yourself copy ( legally ! ) , this one , hands down . that why hesitation aside , there isn't even contest . i love it , it already indispensable , even first-gear user.mymac.com rating : 5 out	1

i'm freelance writer reviewer so i quite bit typing . i've carpal tunnel years but it gotten progressively worse . when i saw dragon naturally speaking 8 store i thought i would give it try , especially since it very affordable . this my first review entirely vocal dictation . ( i'm speaking , it writing down my words this review box ! ) it took me less than hour get this program up running , program responds remarkably fast . accuracy some words sometimes hit miss , though . example " hit miss " previous sentence , it wrote " hidden menace " . however , there accuracy tool included which checks audio settings , perform additional training ( reading information into microphone ) , add words your documents vocabulary , more . i haven't used this tool yet , though . i said , i'm less than one hour into testing this it performing great ! if you're used speaking fast loose you may adjust your speaking style when using this tool , enunciating very clearly . during training session they recommend speaking like news broadcast , example . but you don't need speak word word very slowly ... normal speech fine . i find headset comfortable i'm amazed responsiveness this tool . i expected it take longer learn use . if you limited use your hands or carpal tunnel syndrome , i highly recommend dragon naturally speaking 8 . all it takes installing cd-rom , plugging headset speakers doing vocal test adjust microphone levels . i'm excited use this product , which no doubt make life easier both me my hands ! i love it i use this tool word documents , emails , website use !	1
