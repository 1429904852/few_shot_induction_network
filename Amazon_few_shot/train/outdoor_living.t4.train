these lights don't hold charge . i called manufacturer they said these " summer/spring " lights require 12 hours direct sunlight work . ad amazon not say . i even charged batteries using wall charger they still barely held charge ( 1 - 2 hours ) . they also very dim lights . don't waste your money	-1

this metal detector nice , notwithstanding , it performs poorly when all metal mode . initially all metal mode works fine , however , after half hour use batteries begin wear out battery low indicator not come . when all metal mode used after half hour detector use , it just squeals uncontrollably . it supposed go off over metal pin point source your initial find great accuracy . again , after thirty minutes use detector , it no longer go off over source , it just go off constantly , no mater where you hold it . i could hold it into air it still squeals . i made every adjustment i could it just continues make noise . this mode worthless unless your using it two fresh 9 volt batteries every half hour . finally , if you're hunting say meteorites four hours , you expect spend over $56.00 batteries afternoon	-1

i am owner kamado , purchased august 2000 when company wan located sacramento , ca . after owning unit less than two years , i started develop cracks interior kamado . company would not replace or honor life time warranty unit . since time tiles come loose sheets i defective unit unsightly not what i purchased supposed lifetime warranty . all calls emails company would not resolve defects materials workmanship . company answer glue tiles back unit . this not acceptable unit this cost . check see if you unit made ceramic materials or portland cement case mine . unless kamado changed their manufacturing process ensenada , mexico units made portland cement . this material not last carries no lifetime warranty . i am sorry give them one star , they don't negative star number . check out this company san diego bbb sacramento bbb read before you buy . there various website deal thefraud kamado group . their website not allow any truthful posts . truthful posts removed almost immediately . they say ebay , buyer beware , fraud , not what they represen t.t here true ceramic cookers out there sale , truly ceramic not ceramic coated tiles grout . good luc	-1

one star lowest rating i give this system it frankly not worth even . problems start design . you take out eight tiny little screws insert backup batteries or plug sensor cable into nifty looking " solar powered " sender unit , which placed somewhere full sunlight it function all . once you've mounted unit your roof , you remove those pesky little screws roof , freezing wind usually , several times winter . or wait spring nice weather when you don't need know if you expect black ice your early morning drive work . sometimes resetting base station works ( which you place inconveniently so unit direct line sight communication . usually not . os sales it advertised 300 feet , but actually something less than forty if your batteries more than day old ( see battery change procedure above ) . way , there backup nicad battery unit , supposedly kept charged impressive solar power collector . this fail because it rapidly loses capacity due poor discharge recharge cycle . if any these three fail , unit won't function . strangely enough , my rain gauge ( i live desert ) continued function over year little attention . however , temp/humidity sensor which i would like refer most often , what fails every night . i'd like replace nicad battery , but can't find one anywhere . ahem . customer service lack it . i don't know how many emails i've sent . or calls i've placed . or time i've spent listening backside oregon scientific hold button . their website only lists complete systems replacement parts category . while assumptions dangerous , my only option seems scrap $300 worth two-year old hardware buy more , more , more . this well-intended gift . i'm trying make it work . but it doesn't , usually when i need it most .	-1
we took chance these part father day gift piece metal acts spring broke after only 1 use . after reading reviews i called company instead returning refund . they very nice sent out one . this one just broke - exactly like other one - after month use . overall design tongs great like other raichlen products but construction severely lacking . don't waste your money this model .	-1

i more or less forced buy this product because i very precise size requirements this product fitted them . i very disappointed quality product cost . it comes 19 different pieces , all which hollow plastic polymer . it fairly lightweight , which could good or bad depending what you plan it . $200+ price , you'd think they would include shelf , but they only give you stencil make it yourself out ' shelving material ' . my biggest complaint i missing four pieces other extra pieces when i received it . i got bounced back forth amazon suncast customer service before i got right people suncast send me replacement parts ( which took over week arrive ) . top , they didn't even send me right replacement parts ! after phone call explanation , more parts sent . if i keep extras i , make couple more calls , i may enought second shed . ugh . directions ok , but they'll make you scratch your head you look through all similiar looking parts . especially when they don't send you right pieces	-1

you won't find single expert hummingbirds who recommends " instant nectar " products such this one . why ? because 1 ) they're complete waste your money 2 ) they expose birds ridiculously high concentrations inadequately tested chemicals . cheapest easiest feeder solution also happens closest chemical composition natural flower nectar : solution 3 or 4 parts water one part ordinary white sugar . if you want sugar dissolve faster , get additive-free superfine baking sugar . don't use honey , food coloring , kool-aid , jello , or any other junk - birds drink nectar just energy get everything else their bodies need eating insects	-1

when i bought this product , it said " new " ! however , upon opening package it arrived , cooker already opened inner box . i though perhaps someone just opened inner box check item before it sent ? i opened inner box , one " legs " cooker broken off rusted ! i needed use this right away so i not send it back . now i get this " leg " welded back ! beware " new " designation !	-1
price i paid i expected much more accuracy . data it downloads its external monitor pc terrible . even though unit synchronized atomic clock it still seems get dates wrong data it stores its database . it also problem accumulated rainfall . amount rainfall according database much higher what display shows accumulated amount . hourly 24 hour period also tend behave eratically . you might see inch rain last hour but when you come back later , last 24 hours shows only . 2 inches rain . strange . how you more rain last hour than last 24 ? seems backwards . good side , unit easy set up connects your pc existing ports cable provided . bad side , besides inaccurate , analysis software primitive difficult work . you better off downloading text file doing analysis excel . this unit also gives eratic readings temperature swinging up down up six degrees within twenty minute window . i wanted my son see how temps over 24 hour period form bell shaped curve . so much . this probably ok first time weather station my 8 year old but i would not recommend it any one else since this unit not cheap . one other thing , it only takes reading every 1-3 minutes so wind speed readings hit miss . you could getting gusts much higher than what this unit happens read . i am dissapointed annoyed i spent money it not least semi-accurate . i tell you i it set up wireless . if you use enclosed hard wire connection option then you get more frequent readings maybe even better accuracy . good luck your homework first .	-1

one thing which mystifies me how few people embraced latest modern clock technology : radio controlled clocks which keep exact time automatically synchronizing themselves signals broadcast incredibly accurate u.s. atomic clock boulder colorado . such clocks not only always accurate fraction second , they also automatically set themselves daylight savings standard time appropriate . furthermore , such clocks typically quite reasonable price . yet while most americans , example , latest modern cordless phones cell phones , relatively few accuracy convenience radio controlled clocks . this model just one many styles sold amazon other vendors . try one i think you'll glad you . my wife i several these clocks throughout our house take accurate time granted , no what time system effect	1
this brush just awesome , good price boot ! works perfect my weber grill .	1
clock set itself right away during daytime it performed very well point . all i put battery it hang it wall facing general direction colorado i experienced no problems it then or now . i would advise anyone get one these clocks since they perform well accurate	1

i purchased 2 these clocks now . moment i inserted batteries clock started advancing stopped 4 ' o ' clock . i getting ready ship it back thinking it bad clock . but within 5 minutes both clocks received transmission corrected themselves exact time . so moral story don't return clocks without giving it some time it looks like these clocks stop 4 doesn't move all till it receives time	1
note : amazon description not include dimensions . package it recommends you measure first . it fits smokers 30 " ( 76cm ) across ( perhaps including handles , not sure ) 36 " ( 91cm)vertically . it bit big my standard-sized smoker ( 20 " across ) , so it unflattering its graceful curves , but good enough useful . it cheaply made , but looks like it suitable . i update my report if it falls apart use ( like reviewer said ) . it quite possible garbage bag would enough protect your grill . main advantage here it fits bit better , elastic close bottom bit . it probably looks bit better , if you care	1
keeps ribs searing . lower profile than most rib racks so it easier turn rib	1
i using this rack all summer still yet see it rust someone mentioned earlier review . rack certainly space saver comes handy when you lot grilling . i used it when smoking chicken ribs my weber kettle , noticed meat may tend touch when placed rack so not all areas may exposed smoke . if this happens , i may rotate pieces or just leave it like it since i'm not entering anything competition ! everything still same great taste but parts not exposed smoke different color .	1
i love this clock ! it big enough see all around back yard , looks great . keep mind they recommend keeping it sheltered extreme weather ... we ours under upper deck , so it sheltered rain . that extreme weather gets here los angeles	1
this grill great alternative expensive larger grills , perfect entry level weber apartment etc . only thing i think i dont care handle gets very hot so careful	1
we bought this use beach house , grills provided houses always dreadful . it worked perfectly grill shrimp , hamburgers hot dogs . it easy transport easy use very little assembly required	1
just make sure people don't make same mistake i , aware this not compatible weber 200 silver portable propane gas grill . amazon.com lists this rotisserie accessory weber 200 , so it amazon deserves low rating so i just given this current average 4 stars	1
it works new jersey , just wait night before you say something else	1
short it this clock performs its job quite admirably . you insert single aa battery then press one four buttons back tell it whether you eastern time , central time , mountain time , or pacific time . wait bit - mine received signal 3 minutes later , some people wait overnight . it receives radio signals colorado it readjust itself nightly keep near perfect time . it also factor daylight savings time . these it well - so it gets 5 stars because it what it supposed . however , if you live east coast , you must recognize you farther away radio source . this clock may not able set itself unless , example , placed near window . this not fault clock , but rather limitation radio waves . otherwise , clock seems well made , wood looks real , numbers easy read distance	1
like all weber products i owned , this brush excellent job	1
brush good job loosening grit grime your grill , but you still going break down wash grill soap water now then . brush strong wooden handle , leather loop , sturdy set bristles , grill scraper tough jobs . sure buy this longer brush 12-inch one not reach , especially larger grills	1

it radium so we see time dark during night without turning light	1
this great clock . looks good , makes no noise , very easy read . setup should simple , but i would suggest adding button change manual automatic . you usually don't get clock midnight you want setup it right beginning . since it not going able sync early afternoon , you want set time manually leave clock sync night . but this where additional button comes handy , cause moving hands same button its hard know if clock left automatic or not	1
we bought this clock replace one those cheap quartz wall clocks our new ( used ) motorhome . i wanted it so i would not wear watch but would still dependable accurate time piece . it took couple nights before lacrosse atomic clock received signal synch up , but after it seems working exactly advertised , accurate right second . this clock large protrudance back where clock works reside so bezel not sit flush wall . either large hole needs cut wall or you just live it . no big deal , but it something difficult see photos internet . this why i gave it 4 out 5 stars	1
cover exactly what i needed protect our smoker weather . it strong appears durable . i felt price fair this product	1
i using this rack all summer still yet see it rust someone mentioned earlier review . rack certainly space saver comes handy when you lot grilling . i used it when smoking chicken ribs my weber kettle , noticed meat may tend touch when placed rack so not all areas may exposed smoke . if this happens , i may rotate pieces or just leave it like it since i'm not entering anything competition ! everything still same great taste but parts not exposed smoke different color .	1

ok , i'm not freak , but i love grill i own least 5 weber grills . this one hands down best . i've using mine since 1993 it one own . buy this model today they redesigned it without stainless work area . it perfect cooking , smoking , grilling , etc . every thanksgiving i cook turkey grill it hit every time . also , leaves oven free other stuff . this mouth watering juicy turkey ... every time . burgers come out great . chicken . bbq . i've it all this grill it great . buy cover take care this ... it your favorite piece cookware you ever purchased . thanks weber ... it best	1
( husband writing review :) i use my lodge sportsman often possible , but sometimes it still go into storage while . this rugged cover custom fit , i appreciate how much cleaner my grill when i pull it out . keeps dust cobwebs minimum ; keeps rain out if you forget leave it outside . it well worth it if you're going invest grill .	1
i got this grill last year father day gift . i'd never smoked any meat my life but grill-man looong time . this smoker makes it easy . i've ribs , brisquet , pork steaks , chicken . all turned out great , brisquet especially ! make sure you cure inside grill before cooking anything it . there instructions box . also , if your model doesn't come built-in thermometer , make sure you order one char-broil website . using standard oven thermometer wastes time precious heat	1
i bought this grill set my fiance . he absolutely loved them . they heavy extremely sturdy . i would definitely recommend them !	1
my husband loved size , quality heavy weight this product . great male chef family	1
very well made product . i am extremely pleased . heck lot better than cheap cover i got ebay last year very deceptively advertised regarding it durability	1
highly recommed this grill cover . appearance/style classy it subtle colors work well backyard patio . it sooo durable ! i'm sure it last years . no more ugly black vinyl covers you punch holes first time you try drape them over grill . i'll never use anything else besides this artisan grill cover now !!	1
this new line grills everything you could ask grill . high btu output , large cooking surface good looking . i able maintain constant temperatures no problem all . i am very happy this descision	1
i've used my smoker 7 years now i nothing but great things say it . one recomendation drill small hole top insert metal stem thermometer ( $7 ) accurate monitoring smoking . you'll get best results when you hold temps desired levels . it also comes handy checking internal temps meat . after 7 years , heating element broke new ones $40 through char broil . i'm appalled they're so much , am contemplating buying smoker instead .	1
i recently purchased weber gold series grill wanted quality grilling tools complimented stainless steel design grill . i decided this spatula because quality normally associated weber name i not disappointed . spatula handle attractive rubber grip comfort . length spatula great reaching back grill large flanks fish . i would highly recommend this spatula anyone who searching quality accessory their weber grill !	1
it hard better than weber this grill not disappointed two years i owned it . i use it 3-4 times week cooked just everything you imagine it . i am very satisfied its performance , but it few minor flaws . i still my genesis series propane grill still fine after 12 years , but it not big enough so i moved up . pros : stainless doesn't rust . large enough cook substantial amount using indirect method . last night , i simultaneously grilled 4 t-bones , 10 skewers tequila-lime shrimp , sweet peppers , bread . that why i wanted this grill . i need room cook . insulated box holds heat well . first side burner i've actually works . assembly relatively easy . strong rotisserie motor . spin turkey or 3 chickens ; no problem . smoker box w/ its own burner great feature . stainless grates better than any others i used past . lots shelf space w/ fold-down shelves . battery-fired push button starters all burners easy reliable all weather conditions . cons : expensive . but i expect long service life . gas guzzler . more than one tank helpful . couldn't find cover fits it . but it stainless ... gas gauge doesn't work well , but no biggie . bottom cookbox warped little resulting grates loose shifting more than i'd like . occasion when cleaning grates , they fall into bottom cookbox . i work around this probably fix it without too much trouble , but it tick me off . this cost them my 5th star ; i expected better . so i pretty much love this grill it good thing , because i believe i'll it good long while . chad , weird chain door manually lighting grill . it match holder chain attached door so you won't lose it . go figure	1
i think this great product . first one lasted over year it runs 24/7 , even winter	1
i've watching silver while , thinking buy it amazon while it sale . but i finally decided get it local ace hardware store . here why : pirces not significant differrent amazon ace . but ace offered free assembly , free delivery , free gas refill . most important feature me : they allowed me upgrade it stainless steel cooking grates flavorizer bar only $20 extra . ( which $100 value amazon . ) regular grates flovorizer bar , you replace it couple years hard clean . but stainless steel type may last much longer easy maintain . so if you buy it amazon , you pay base price , plus shipping cost , self assembly , gas refill , upgraded cooking grates flavorizer bar etc . choice yours	1
this grill works great really survives elements . it looks brand new even after stormy winter our chicago balcony . i highly recommend it smaller places because shelves fold down out way when not use	1
i impressed looking this grill home depot , even more impressed price amazon.com . using grill , i discovered weber truly better than what i used past . food actually tastes better ! assembly took little longer than 30 minutes given instruction sheet . i little difficulty interpreting pictures , i feel some written instructions would beneficial	1
this sofa complete bargain . it stylish design comfortable . cushion firm supportive . colour texture all-weather wicker fantastic . it strong , standing up our kids , yet light easy move around . it arrived very promptly i'm delighted	1
yourself favor give yourself this gift- beautiful cover great grill . this absolutely nicest grill cover i've ever seen , i've paid 3 times this flimsy ones . i don't agree it too snug , it slipped right over no tugging , looks very neat tailored , but i don't like big billowy ones anyway . excellent deal , prompt shipping .	1
weber grill cover easy use . i would recommend this grill cover anyone wanting protect their weber grill . it fits grill very well easy clean .	1
this product exact replacement original grates . they great , however , if i it again , i could find one , i might gone upgraded quality grate	1
i thought these grates weren't good enough sears meat , boy i wrong . beautiful lines meats got me great reviews my guests . easy clean too	1
great price this unit . saw same one locally $159.00 not color wood i needed . followed directions works great . package new item advertised " nib " . amazon must gotten buy this wood color it cheaper than same units withdifferent wood	1
i bought this item based upon reviews i read i must say it lived up reviews . it job . i bought this late summer but one time i used it i impressed amount bugs it zapped short space time . i saw felt effectiveness product because i stayed backyard longer than usual	1
this my second bug zapper . took brand back didn't work . this zapper working great , that all thanks its intelligent design . some bug zappers super small entry holes , then wimpy little electrodes inside . this zapper designed let bugs fly easily , it vertical electrodes zap bugs . this zapper works really well ... fact other night it zapping like crazy because it hot bugs out . we live urban area near plant nursery , so we'd always bugs coming back door . now this zapper kills them attracts them away our backdoor . great product	1
reviewers who report grille doesn't get hot enough , slightest breeze blows flame out you should need stock up extra gas cannisters , i would point out : this review charcoal model !! once coals fully going mine , nothing short hurricane katrina could blow them out , proper amount charcoal loaded , you all heat you'll ever need . i nothing but praise mine . nice going , weber	1
we pleased our recent purchase . we surprised it came through us mail service . it broken part we believe used cord open umbrella .	1
bought this umbrella last week ( 9/23/05 ) amazon . initially hesitant purchasing it due other reviews describing issue pole two pieces , which , when connected , never straight . all i want add here i not experience this problem . screw mechanism which joins poles seems sturdy , pole appears perfectly straight . i wonder if other people bought umbrellas bad batch or manufacturer redesigned connection mechanism ? ( most recent reviews not mention this problem)re . overall quality , i can't speak how pole or umbrella itself wear over time , but least initially it looks good quality sturdy construction . one thing note despite product description picture making it look like pole made wood , it appears actually made some sort metal which wood coloured ( it still looks like wood though would not look out place wooden patio furniture ) . honest i actually prefer this , since i would imagine it won't discolour easily natural wood should longer lasting . summary , am very pleased my purchase - i would happily recommend it others looking good quality umbrella very reasonable price	1
we ordered umbrella replace one we many years . when product arrived , we surprised quality product such small price . we very satisfied	1
i heard this grill " only " 36000 btu , not hot some other grills . believe me , this puppy plenty hot if all you going cook food ! disregard this btu rating . this btu rating rubbish . this grill transfer so much heat your food so fast if you're not used cooking high-quality grill you turn your beautiful porterhouses into charchol ( i used custom-cut 3-inch porter house break my new grill , my surprise , it closer well than i prefer , but still delicious ! ) everything high-quality . it much more solid than all other grills i looked , grill very even terms heating . besides , it beautiful . side burner not something i really interested , but i just went it . i used it first time . this grill you need	1
i love it ! it bit work maintain , but it awesome grill cooks everything ( once i figured out how cook got good grill cook book ) . i bought two propane cylinders just swap them out when gauge they hang says it quarter tank . it worth price	1
i like this rotisserie quality , ease use , functionality . rotisserie fits my weber performer grill ( which i also like lot ) perfectly , which no surprise since it made specifically weber 22 1/2 inch kettle grill . spit nice chrome finish , forks , appears it last . this my first rotisserie unit , perhaps this might common knowledge , but after using it few times , i found using balancing weight works best first putting your bird or roast spit , then inserting loaded spit ring without weight tightened down or inserted motor , so spit may find its own balance , which naturally its heavy-side down . next , i tighten weight opposite this heavy side , insert it motor , turn it . i then play positioning weight relative spit , but remaining opposite heavy side , so it spins least amount strain motor . ( hope wasn't too wordy . ) anyway , i've cooked chickens , roast , 12 pound turkey ( hoping cook big honkin ' turkey soon ) , all great success . conjunction rotisserie , i've finally discovered canjun injector , hypodermic needle-like flavor injector . using both brings out juicy flavorful foods . one other tip ... carfully open keep box rotisserie came storage . i put some self-stick velcro box ends , it keeps this otherwise awkward store gizmo safe stack-able . i plan buy rotisserie unit my weber gas grill . i don't know why , but addition more succulent outcome food , seeing your food spin around fire adds anticipation meal	1
ring motor what they supposed . ring not fit very well , first , it able rock back forth . however , after little bending into shape , it fit more snug . way ring rests kettle , there alway some gap , which not allow good seal . i not only use this rotisserie , but also give me more room beer chicken . its worth getting it added flexibility .	1
this cover extremely heavy duty survived many windy thunderstorms still good new after year half . it still going strong , still good new	1
this pest repeller works great my attic repelling squirrels . squirrels broken three times gone within 15 minutes . i would not use this inside house because it make constant chirp sound . i can't hear this noise attic , so i buy when this wears out .	1
this solid body storage building exactly advertised . my goal store mower , trimmer , blower , gas miscellaneous items . i build shelf ( not included ) notch it fit install it before putting roof place . it works great gas miscellaneous items leaving room taller items but they must tilted some . if you mower retractable handles ( which i not ) it fit this building . ( so mower still out ) other than it cleared up mess back locks flammables up too . careful read instructions because it would very difficult take pieces apart after clicked into place . if you planning store mower i would recomend larger unit just ease use . this one great lot gardening supplies but i think they should provide least 2 or more shelves	1
protecting your grill important if you leave it outside all time . this far best grill cover we . it easy put over grill , velcro straps keep it flying off , it fits genesis s-320 perfectly , it heavyweight . recommended , definitely	1
i purchased this smoker last summer . assembly simple . one piece hardware missing , but no trouble replacing nut holds thermometer place . i replaced factory regulator adjustable unit get any level heat i desire . it sensitive wind though .	1
this sonic pest repeller works lot better than others . it keep away lot rodents decrease number spiders drastically . you start see less less spider webs it not make whole lot noise . i would define tally recommend this over other sonic pest repellers well worth money how much decrease insects creatures	1
this smoker works like charm ! only regret i it bit larger than i expected , i should bought next size down . other than times i used it results great . temperature easy control main concern i wanted sometime i didn't babysit while i smoking my ribs or pork shoulder . others complained receiving units damaged , i guess i lucky , there slight crease one corner but i able straighten it out easily . better packaging would improvement . my . 02 it well worth investment	1
down here southern mississippi you sit inside ac summer or hang hammock shade - but this my best one ever probably my last one since it so lightweight i prefer carry it out weather even though it so durable . i've several rope hammocks replace each year but this durable fabric one cannot beat . grandbaby loves it	1
i got this hammock back november , so i don't know if this hammock good summer , but it perfect hammock winter ! my fiance i could nap it all afternoon couple pillows blanket middle winter . it very comfortable even 2 people it . surface seems semi water resistance . we left it out rain few times most water stay top surface . we just turn hammock , dump out water , it dried under sun few hours . i read somewhere green stripes fade over time , but i live it	1
this bbq tool set absolutely top line , worth much more than i paid it ! all tools heavy wood rubber grips , heavy stainless steel . even case made hold up long time . i truly impressed when i received it	1
i'm new world smoking , ordered this when i dont feel like doing whole charcoal thing . it works fairly well flavor great , but not quite much you get using charcoal grill . i think it designed placed either side grill ... i've opted slide grates sides place smoker middle ... it seems less smoke escapes grill this way . worthwhile purchase	1
i always recommend oxo line tools anyone lot cooking wants something really designed use . this especially true anyone problems such tendonitis , arthritis , or carpal tunnel -- these tools all designed leverage energy efficiently instead wasting energy most poorly designed utensils . try them out	1
after assembling stand i very pleased my decision purchase this one . i also ordered extension , thinking my mayan family hammock i would need make it longer . but my surprise , hammock fit perfectly without extension , because height stand adjusted pretty high , you could put longer hammock it because this . very heavy steel , well enameled , excellent workmanship very easy assemble . ***** - definitely five star purchase	1
after college i moved back home few months before getting my own place . it totally sitcom setup i lived my mom basement - but mice spiders down there not funny all . i didn't really mind mice running around every now then , but when one got under covers me , i enough . i went local brick mortar store bought all kinds different traps , deterrents , etc try get them out or trap them without harming critters ( mom wouldn't it ) . i bought single two-pack these things immediately after i plugged first one , i saw two mice immediately come out their hiding spot scurry unfinished part basement . one my bedroom one bathroom basement enough me , but mom husband so impressed he bought dozen more rest basement ( lots separate rooms ) garage . definitely read tips suggestions - they only work if there large , open space so put this outlet " full view " room . each room need it own , very large room ( like two-bay garage ) need two or three . we put these up three years ago there hasn't mouse basement since	1

this little clock worked exceedingly well first . clear , large display bright enough read but not so bright it distracting night . it takes up little space night table , which great . however , if it your night table you'll angle it so clock face nearly toward wall , you can't adjust projection . if you face clock out toward far wall , projection diplayed upside down . still , i okay this , projection what i interested . worked great until it accidentally got knocked off nightstand onto carpet . one mishap projection broken . nothing could fix it ; you can't even open clock explore mechanics it . without projection , it simply procey bed-side alarm clock . it my fault knocking it over , but i would think clokc this caliber should bit sturdier	1

reference , " old tanks " refer this review weber " quick connect tanks . " first price : i got this home depot $16.95 because i needed grill hurry . if you not opd tank your weber grill see yourself future refilling , you would receive it time before you run out , then i would recommend getting it amazon lesser price but afford shipping time . if you older weber grill wanted tank refilled , then you probably understand frustration i go through get more propane . federal law mandated all tanks now " opd " certified . now , these opd tanks , which detected " star " shape handle , different opening where hose your grill needs connected compared older model . so when i went it refilled , they told me they could no longer refill my old model . so i bought blue rhino . then , i could not connect it my weber grill because different opening . ( propane hose would not adapt tank . ) so i now three options . one buy new grill , which would quite expensive . second , which weber recommended , probably because it would cost me more money , would buying new hose . ( they said it around $40 . i also heard it problem squirrels eating it . ) third this adapter i found . thus , this adapter answer price . connect thread side adapter your hose other side adapter ( this " spring side " or " quick connect " side where release hose adapter , you must just pull back end part adapter . ) picture adapter new tank old hose found here : http://www.homedepot.com/cmc_upload/hdus/en_us/asset/images/eplus/161203_3.jpgi also some advice using product which i hope you may find useful . ( installation instructions quite weak product . ) when installing , there black plastic piece which used screw adapter part . careful when using your crescent wrench not break off part . if you break plastic piece , you probably unable take off adapter tank future . therefore , i would also recommend placing piece safe place so when you need refill , it handy take off adapter . however , if you lose piece , or break it , there one more way it refilled . there adapter which placed old tanks refilling . since this product basically converts your new tank into old one , then you place this refilling adapter product . i know it confusing words , but basically what i am saying you adapter adapter when refilling tank . your refill store most likely this second adapter you when you go refill . ( i get mine pool-mart they usually this handy . ) but just safe side , i would keep plastic piece . but back installation : when you finished screwing it , just connect your hose other side pulling back only part adapter moves , once you push hose end into adapter , push back up only part adapter moves lock hose place . remove hose , simply pull back sliding adapter piece - only part moves . but most likely you didn't need you refilled your old grill sometime last several years . but just case you may needed it . performance , there no leaks , shown soap water test . just pure gas grilling all i now until law passed . but until then , i recommend two things : first buying this adapter , second using common sense install it , not instructions . happy grilling , thanks reading	1

i lot searching review reading internet before finally deciding what buy . i am convinced quick draw ii best value available any make any conpany . features qdii generally found only much higher priced detectors . this thing really works advertised . i already found several coins other things right my own yard . it reliably indicate what coin detected although it many times confuses dimes pennies lcd readout . it very sensitive detects most coin size items very reliably 6 or 8 inches . auto notch discrimination works well filters out most trash items . i used metal detectors ended up aggravating frustrating . this one pleasure use quickly becoming relaxing profitable pastime me . if you want serious metal detector without spending whole lot money give it try ... you won't disappointed ..	1
our old general electric indoor/outdoor thermometer outdoor sensor broke this summer , so it time replace it weather station could give more info weather than just temp . i live south florida , it nice know what heat index , because summer , our temps coast rarely rise above 90 degrees , but heat index rarely below 100 ( which case i choose indoor treadmill over running outside ) . i bought this unit strength prior reviews , which i think pretty darn accurate their overall assessment . i can't present much new information here , but i validate some prior comments . weather station constructed cheap plastic . i think if this station falls off our kitchen bar , where it rests today , it break into smithereens . it'll best hung nail wall or put location where it not going fall ground -- ever . weather station clumsy vertical design small base so i think it'd pretty easy bump into it knock it over . same advice above paragraph applies here , too . weather station emit high-pitched tone when you press button backlight display few seconds . it not big deal me , but some might find annoying . weather station clutzy , non-intuitive method setting display which really call pressing set button up 11 times ! each depression set button selects one area display set , there lot settings displayed ( time , day , date , etc . ) . it pretty easy spend moment setting weather station ( despite clutzy interface ) , because i live eastern time zone , my job made easier because default setting eastern time zone . clock automatically synchronized some atomic clock somewhere , so part worked just fine . accuracy , well , i've it only few days now , but it seems working alright . we've rain last few days , barometric display -- which only shows clouds/rain , partly sunny , sunny -- accurately forecasted cold front drop air pressure . when i put outdoor sensor next indoor sensor ( inside my house ) , readings within few tenths degree each other . humidity readings exactly same . weather station reads . 3 . 7 degrees warmer than my old indoor/outdoor thermometer . i wouldn't know which two digital displays accurate -- my old thermometer or this new weather station . weather station seem lot more jumpy when it comes reading indoor temp . it quick ( when compared my old indoor thermometer ) change reading when , say , air conditioning turns . lunar phase display nice touch . overall , i like this unit so far . i wish it constructed more durable plastic -- my old ge indoor/outdoor unit built thrown against wall without damaged -- i think i'd prefer thermometer reading wasn't quick so jumpy temperature fluctuations . i like humidity readings both indoor outdoor , i especially like heat index calculation . all , i would recommmend this weather station other buyers	1

this my first charcoal grill i say , i bought it because weber reputation so many years best charcoal grill . mentioned , it isn't very big indirect cooking . i cook just my wife me it fine but too small cooking guests . if i could it over again , i'd buy 22 1/2 " grill because it larger cooking area ability add rotisserie attachment . i'm not big rotisserie guy but extention needed cook beer chicken , something i always loved cook gas grills .	1
choosing our first grill really simple decision . we knew we wanted something quality would last us while . weber only way go our minds . now we own this grill i honestly say hardly day goes we don't use it!i'm really glad we opted one touch rather than smokey joe same manufacturer . this grill hook inside cover hang side ash clean up very easy . two us , this grill enough keep us or even guests well entertained . highly recommended	1

this unit easy load , easy maintain temperature , simply cooks best barbeque . i not seen any other wood or charcoal smoker compare , dollar dollar . you complete control over how smokey flavor ( or isn't ) . i only check temp once every hour . i 5 full racks ribs ( ribrack ) , not quot ; babybacksquot ; either , plus 2 pork shoulders once , could fit more ! use all charcoal , all wood , or any combination . i also use charwood because it burns so clean . i recommend ordering optional thermometer which fits built-in opening right hand side big door . holds up 100 lbs meat ! drippings drain lower right . firebox easy clean , i use garden trowel . tomorrow i'm doing 2 racks ribs , 10 lbs . chicken wings , corn cob ... i love it !!!!	1
i've this grill almost year now no reliability problems it . i purchased mine lowe . grill very good flame/temperature control side burner excellent . i grill it seven days week through summer months warm weekends fall . heat pretty even inside there really isn't any major hot/cold spots . side burner nice since it comes non stick coated griddle cooking . i actually used this feature late fall during power outage cook eggs french toast breakfast . side burner without griddle cast iron pot holder . lid side burner large enough you close it when using smaller pots . very useful windy or chilly days . overall i am extremely pleased this grill i no rust or wearing issues it . only drawback grill design ignitor only works far left burner . it lights 3 burners left right . so if your only using 1 burner quick meal like hot dogs or hamburgers 2 people you need always use left burner	1

we bought this fireplace we love it ! big enough crowd 10 or more people lawn chairs sitting around enjoying it ( we family picnic everyone commented how nice it ) . small enough storage our small shed winter . directions putting it together bit confusing ( per my husband ) . ours also came additional piece allow outdoor cooking fireplace ( we haven't used it yet ) . ours also came cover put over it when not use which perfect keeping water out it . great buy !! we use it frequently ! highly recommend it .	1
this clock very easy set up ... pop battery within 5 minutes it sets itself . it large face numbers easy read distance , making it perfect business use . it only few dollars more than clock no automatic time setting , so it worth it me least one clock i'll only check when battery wears down	1
this unit harder set up than others i , however price options it great buy	1
i little reluctant purchase these because i heard lot things spring mechanism them faulty but they recalled fixed . so i wondering if one i bought fixed model or not . well , it must newer design because i've using these few months i nothing but good things say them . i previously using long oxo set tongs which pretty good but little flimsy some heftier cuts meat like , whole chickens pork shoulders . these tongs sturdy ! you know minute you pick them up feel weight them . they easily pick up anything you need grill , because 20 inch length , you keep you hand safe distance actual fire . handle grooves your fingers thumbs which enhances grip they lock closed position storage . if you any outdoor cooking , you appreciate these tongs . they're well thought out piece equipment you'll use years glad you purchased	1
this great portable grill size . 14 " one would fine 1-2 people , but not more . this grill handle more charcoal enough room allow 2 heat zones . hardest part finding one ! i finally found one ebay but , you better hurry !	1
though this portable grill , it terrific home use if you're single , or small balcony apartment . it takes very little space , easy maneuver when cleaning time comes . we took ours picnic this weekend grilled two packs hot-dogs once ( 16 thick dogs ) . because grill small , things get hot quick , you need careful easy burn foods should take longer cook . burgers well , steaks fantastic . chicken needs watchful eye . i've used this gem years . my apartments , whole , mandated simplicity efficiency offered up smokey joe . great feature rounded top . this enables better smoking , air smoke circulates more fluidly . downsides : legs aren't sturdy they could . given time , bit bumping around general abuse , screwed legs might turn askew . if you notice this while grill hot , you've problem . solution keep them tight during nonuse . air intake bottom gets clogged ashes . key good charcoal grilling manipulation air flow . intake might open , but stopped up . if you diligent clean ashes , you'll ok . because grill so close ground , you need careful . unlike most weber grill , this one also apt getting kicked over , run into dogs , cars children . i fully recommend weber smokey joe . now , i'm hungry . time stir coals pop few brats . anthony trendl editor , hungarianbookstore.co	1

first all let me say there some reviews you should ignore , such one here says easygreen sprouter not quality piece equipment ! i'm very fussy consumer i honestly say this outstanding unit very high high quality . you also some google searches you find nothing but raves it what high quality it . worth every penny ! secondly , i'm starting believe everone should grow sprouts get vitamins we not getting food our grocery stores . far " produce " goes our grocery stores , you may well eat boxes they shipped ! over over media these days we hearing them say our soils so depleted first place time we get veggies fruits our grocery bags they lost what little nutritional value they ! even organic stuff questionable time it gets our table , let alone fact some organic farmers not really following practices produce nutritional food . they may not using poisonous sprays but they replentishing soil ? ok- enough ! you find tons info your own . if you want something fantastic yourself your family buy one these sprouters start getting nutrition your body begs you ! ( no i don't work them but wish i designed it ! ) this incredible addition world nutrition heck lot cheaper than buying expensive vitamins your body can't absorb very well . we spent thousands vitamins over years . who really knows what them anyway ? you'll know exactly what your sprouts though . they alive packed everything vitamin pill wished it could but can't!! it so so easy you won't even believe it . it fun ! sprouts outstanding cleanest most vitamin packed foods you ever put your mouth . load up sandwich or toss up salad or throw some smoothie . don't forget brocolli sprouts great !! i use half dropper full 35% food grade hydrogen peroxide each time i fill it water every day . ( one gallon ) this perfectly safe actually helps oxiginate sprouts well prevent mold . i so impressed my easygreen sprouter i ordered three more these ( actually called easygrass sprouters ) purchased wheatgrass juicer so i grow wheatgrass , miracle food . ( check out ann wigmore " sprout book " her book wheatgrass ) i can't say enough easygreen sprouter !! apparently people all over world catching this " fountain youth " piece incredible equipment ! some googling see yourself !	1
i bought this clock specifically time projected ceiling night . my wife i recently got new alarm clocks use backlit lcd rather than led numbers , we found we hard time reading them night . we bought this clock solution . my 4 star rating based use alone . it simply not work during daytime- projector not bright enough complete daylight or bright room lights . that good- light bright enough seen during day would far too bright nigh t-t ime use . you disappointed if you want use this thing during day . i would given this clock much lower rating if i intended use " atomic clock " feature , or use it alarm clock . specifically : 1 . atomic clock only works certain parts country . atomic clock broadcasting station denver , co , further away you get denver , less likely you pick it up . we east coast , our house eastern side large hill , this clock never picked up atomic clock signal , despite following instructions meticulously . while it possible we defective unit , based what i've read i just think we're bad spot , this unit doesn't very good antenna . good news internal clock seems keep fine time . 2 . physical construction very , very cheap . it extremely lightweight , easy knock over . power cord connection flimsy , moving clock ( or knocking it over ) result loss power ( your configuration if you don't batteries installed ) . buttons especially cheap , poorly organized . it works fine our use because we don't need touch it , but it would terrible daily alarm clock- unless you lot more patient than i am bedtime , you would not want try set this thing sleepy state mind . unless you lot more coordinated than i am immediately after waking up , you would knock it off nightstand regularly just trying shut it off . it wouldn't stand up long such abuse . but , i said earlier- if all you need put time ceiling , it works admirably . * update * : after using this thing 3 months , it spontaneously picked up atomic clock signal . i no idea why ( we didn't change * anything *) , but it locked couple weeks . -	1

i like oregon scientific products , but their previous atomic alarms quirky controls -- often leading changing time zone middle night rather than turning off alarm . this one lots better ! projection feature works ok , though doesn't really focus sharply close distances i'd prefer use . eight minute snooze alarm great -- just right interval ! overall , nice , useful , moderately expensive alarm clock	1

i weber silver grill several years . grill great , but steel flavorizor bars rust replaced ( i replaced my bars twice five years ) . i just started using ss bars , but i am sure they better than old bars , well worth extra initial cost . if i able get ss bars earlier ( not usually available local markets ) , i probably would not replace bars i ( twice ) . i highly recommend spending extra dollars ss bars when originals fall apart	1

i ordered this clock , then send it back two times before it finally arrived undamaged ( actually , minimally damaged ) . first two times glass cracked broken . third time , all matter minor dent marks metal frame where packaging must pressed down it ( this only noticeable certain light angles ) . shipping problems weren't manufacturers fault though , amazon packing shipping . it'd nice if they maybe put big " don't stack things top this box " sticker or something box so it didn't get damaged . or , bubble wrap , remember stuff ?! those airbags just ain't cuttin ' it . clock itself , i love it . i kept it despite minor denting b/c it discontinued manufacturer , it largest atomic clock i could find didn't some ugly antique-ish design . second hand actually ticks , instead fluidly moving , which nice touch . it easy set up , it big easy read . it reminds clocks all over my high school ( good way ) . all all , very happy actual clock , very dissatisfied w/ amazon shipping packing it	1
this clock works great ! it automatically picks up accurate time through radiowave . it not come product manual but easy figure out . all you selct your time zone button ( pt , mt , ct , et ) put new aa battery . i agree review which mentioned this clock not made durable construction . matter fact , when i picked up clock package , tiny screw came off . it one screws hold back body panel main body . it not affected function well visual part , anyway , so it may not big deal . overall , this clock good enough price	1
all you put batteries wait hour your clock proper time forever ! no climbing reset it daylight savings .	1

i've using metal detectors around 5 years now . my first detector bounty hunter quickdraw ii , very fine , easy learn detector that real workhorse . i learned most everything i know metal detecting personal experience reading lots posts asking lots questions bounty hunter forum http://www.detecting.com i shopped around found bounty hunter land ranger factory shipped model ( no extras except 4 " 8 " coil ) $337 . price , i couldn't afford not buy it ! when land ranger ( lr ) arrived , it 3 pieces extremely easy assemble . manual comes lr gives you basic information you need get started detecting lr , but bit general when it comes explaining what each functions . if you just want " turn go " detector , land ranger may not you . if this case , i would recommend getting easier learn detector such bounty hunter quickdraw ii or even bounty hunter tracker iv . should you later decide get land ranger , your first detector make excellent back-up detector great detector friend or family use you . what i would recommend going bounty hunter forum website listed above learn , way more , information various detectors their various functions than i could ever begin explain here . even though i detecting while , my first trip out land ranger quite overwhelming somewhat frustrating due much greater sensitivity this model , added features it information overload tones responding mineralized ground conditions , trashy areas ( many pulltabs , screwcaps etc . ) condition know " falsing " ( tones due mostly incorrect " sensitivity " settings improper ground balancing ) . initial experience i describe here very common first time land ranger users frustrating , but get much better practice more one learns detecting general land ranger particular . i use land ranger now , i learned much settings , what ignore what watch indicate which targets may worth digging . once past information overload ( happen , i assure you ) , user begin appreciate sensitivity this detector , learn proper settings , begin finding more more valuable items ( or targets they called ) become one this detector . i purchased bounty hunter land ranger it very sophisticated microprocessor features including - target id , vdi ( numeric ) readout indicating target conductivity , 3 tone id , it automatic manual ground balancing , programmable target accept/ reject , all metals , no motion/ pinpoint mode , self tuning ( motion ) all metals mode ( good deep hunting relics , caches and/or gold nugget shooting ) ... ... reputation bounty hunter detectors ... but mainly excellent price such full featured , professional metal detector . i love able put this baby work discriminating out trash items while ringing sharp clear when locating coins jewelry . land ranger also ideal hunting relics ( gold ) nugget shooting , although i not much either these yet ( soon , i hope ) . i also love fact two coils ( standard 8 " 4 " nugget coil ) come stock land ranger i also 10 " coil i purchased around $60 . ( it important several coil sizes available various types hunting ) price additional coils many other brands detectors astronomical , so this integral part my decision get bounty hunter rather than some other brands . i love how lightweight this detector . i love knowing i sophisticated detector not miss items buried deep . ( how deep depends size object , type metal , soil conditions etc ) generally , lr detect depth around 10 " -12 " deep coin sized target . ( believe me , you won't want dig too many objects deep , most targets right around 4 " -6 " deep , due how coins , jewelry etc . tend migrate down into soil , this varies , course , but general , greater number objects somewhere this depth range . what i hate land ranger parts manual give very general description certain features like ground monitor meter or self tuning all metals mode . i wish land ranger waterproof or least water resistant ... it not , i highly recommend you not use it rain without good plastic cover fits securely around control housing . conclusion : i highly recommend land ranger any seasoned detectorist ... or novice detectorist willing devote good deal time fair amount patience mastering many nuances this full featured detector . land ranger hosts target id , ( vdi ) numeric readout , 3 tone id , depth meter , battery meter , ground monitor meter , sensitivity meter target indicator . it touchpad controls sensitivity , accept/ reject discrimination , all metals - no motion/ pinpoint mode , 3 factory preset modes , all metals ( motion ) self tuning mode smart trac automatic manual ground balancing . it handful , but great full featured unit very reasonable price . 5 stars ... highly recommended if you willing devote some time patience learning it traits harnessing it potential , once you , you'll absolutely love it , i know i ! recommendedyes	1

weber grill always cadilac bbq grilling . it quality good - it won't rust last decade even when left outdoors . its other claim fame ability it offers " shut off charcoal " it air tight . " one touch " system just makes it even easier . instead close three bottom vents seperately ( fumbling hot surfaces cannot easily seen ) , you just flip one lever . you make up your mind yourself silver vs . gold models both good . what size you need ? what you want cook ? turkey ? - better get 22 1/2 inch size . if you chicken or roast mind , 18 1/2 inch it save you some fuel boot	1
this works very well chicken ribs well	1

item showed up nearly week before i expecting it . due its weight , free shipping added plus . delivery company actually placed grill inside my garage which very helpful again due its weight size boxes . directions provided assemble grill vague very difficult interupt . directions indicated plan 30 40 minutes assemble . it took almost 2 hours i am very mechanically inclined . once assembled grill worked perfectly . if i it over again , i would buy this grill , but would love better directions	1

very nice product but smaller than i thought it would . wish write up dimensions i unsure size . would liked it bigger .	1
i bought ( apparently identical ) charbroil lowe my son , because it rated so highly consumer . i opportunity cook it twice , very impressed -- very even ; very controllable . so , i bought one myself amazon , am still impressed . i think reviewer who commented bad packing may received received return . packing mine good , everything plastic bagged ; no scratches , finish looked ok . assembly not light-hearted , but biggest problem assembly instruction sheet . not very clear , uses " beside " where it should say " inside " ; makes no mention until 3/4 way through there different lengths screw , not differentiate regular sheet metal screws . however , i no real problem , but assembly take 1 1/2 - 2 hours . i thought construction quite good . certainly nothing much stronger or heavier than it needs , but this means grill no heavier than it needs ! when assembled everything feels very solid . i take wheels off reinstall them after completing frame so i could tighten all screws when frame fully assembled squared . probably not necessary , but it only added 30 seconds . next time i would delay installing wheels few steps . i give five stars because i not know grill this price range large , so many features , cooks so well	1
i 4 more atomic clocks ( 2 more analogue 2 digital ones ) well 3 atomic watches . self setting function works exactly same all them . so i think it worth setting expectations straight how this clock most likely work you . unless you live close colorado ( where time signal originates ) proper way ' setting ' this clock put battery wait overnight clock set itself . best signal reception depends where you live also time year weather conditions . charlotte , nc where i live - most my atomic clocks watches sync themselves around 2 am . i guess it bit confusing people unfamiliar ' atomic ' technology see hands clock start moving around then stopping some random hour if though clock broken ... la crosse ( other makers ) should probably include ' quick start ' card states big bold letters put battery , select your time zone , ignore any hand movement ( or lack there ) then wait overnight . again - unless you live close enough co so clock receive time signal any time day or night - you wait until next day . i've this clock around 6 months now it worked perfectly well ( within 1 second actual time ) exception couple bizarre quirks . one time clock got itself off 15 minutes ( though seconds hand dead ) . i not adjust it - next day it fixed itself through its usual overnight self-setting . time it spontaneously changed time zones started showing california time . this time around i remove battery , reinsert it re-select time zone ( simply re-selecting time zone not solve problem ) . reviewer remarked - clock looks nicer ' person ' than it photos . very thin rim makes dial look bit bigger than stated dimensions would suggest . face color off-white or very light cream looks very nice . build quality - it nothing special . clock 100% plastic ( even ' crystal ' ) except dial which simply paper . whole thing - including mechanism - made china . even though clock probably extremely cheap manufacture ( given its all plastic construction ) it not look ' cheap ' once it hangs wall . i bought virtually identical quality atomic clock seven bux ( delivered ) everybody favorite auction site it looks ok - but not nice this one ( different ' brand ' - not la crosse ) . one star taken off ' quirks ' - but not ' good enough ' materials engineering ( it would better if it made less cheaply - but it looks fine way it ) . michae	1

i like this clock . this night stand alarm clock . it what it supposed very well once it set up . set up not intuitive so you read manual exactly it says . but it not really hard set up it just not easy . you think what you doing . way manual large reviewer commented but it because instructions several languages not because it so complicated . reason i'm giving it 4 stars instead 5 stars plug which ac adapter plugs into , which allows it project time continually , too much space either side . result you think ac adapter plugged up properly when fact adapter gone down either side plug . it took me while figure out what going . first i thought clock defective some other reviewers . that bad design flaw needs fixed . fyi it doesn't project time continually battery mode because would quickly drain batteries . battery mode it only projects time 3 or 4 seconds when you press snooze button . once clock set up your time zone you never set time again , not even daylight savings time , you always correct time . clock built antenna picks up radio signal official u . . government time keeper . once day it sets itself according radio signal . it also sensors tell you indoor humidity temperature .	1

first thing i noticed big kahuna quality construction . after simple assembly process taking 10 minutes ; i fired it up amazed how powereful burner . average home stove burners produce 9,000 14,000 btus -- big boy produces up 65,000 btus ( according eastman ) . if doesn't get your wok turn red hot then nothing short jet engine . subject woks ; i didn't buy one eastman i'm glad i didn't . i'm sure eastman woks top quality but i very good reason my statement . lodge makes iron wok not only less expensive but also fits into big kanuna like key lock ( minor modifications burner rack ) . base lodge pro-logic 14-inch cast-iron wok loop handles not only works great big kahuna but it also sits nicely your stove thanks it flat bottom . ok , world isn't perfect so lodge wok didn't fit into big kahuna grill out box . order make it fit , i filed down four cross members grill 1/8 " each side now it fits like glove . this huge advantage over curved bottom wok because wok simply can't move much safer use ( considering high temperature cooking surfaces this big plus ) . let face it : nobody wants hold their wok place while cooking if this avoided . i also recommend you get eastman stainless wok spatula ( also amazon ) -- it almost requiremen t.t he only thing i would change big kahuna would add electronic ignition . i'll probably add one myself using outdoor grill parts . keep mind big kahuna , wok spatula lodge wok all available amazon which means free super-saver shipping available amazon -- resulting considerable savings these heavy items . you could easily pay twice much elsewhere .	1
this works well . easy use quite affordable . it would perfect if it clock well , but temperature humidity readings it works great	1
i've several wireless atomic weather stations they all looked somewhat cheesy obvious spot , so you find yourself tempted hide it away this course defeats its original purpose . lacrosse model matches our kitchen cabinets wonderfully functional .	1

this unit works well . 90 foot max range direct line sight . walls obstructions reduce this distance significantly . oregon scientific makes number main units remote sensors . they not all work together . check their web site which remotes work which main units before you buy : http://www2.oregonscientific.com/service/sensors/default.asp .	1
this nice addition anyone patio . product came very well packaged heavy duty double boxes legs wrapped padded paper . assembly took around 30 minutes . others commented holes don't line up naturally require some " finessing " order get lined up , but really wasn't difficult overcome . all required assembly 4mm allen wrench which provided ( although end started get worn 1/2 way through assembly required me use wrench ) . probably one nicest features table adjustable levelers legs . this seems like good quality i am confident last many years come	1
when researching metal detectors before buying bounty hunter tracker iv christmas gift , i learned using earphones detector not only makes hearing " beeps " much easier , but also extends battery life battery detector . we live windy , windy canyon area , so i knew earphones necessity because constant wind noise . my husband says earphones effectively screen out noise would overpower emissions detector if he weren't wearing headset . he happy camper his bounty hunter tracker iv bounty hunter stereo earphones	1
