this product so disappointing i discarded entire box after trying one bar . there much better raw food bars market terms both nutrition taste	-1
silly me ! i assumed these bars would taste like spirulina cashews , but only ingredient you taste them , or any their other " flavors " dates . if you really love dates , go it . otherwise , forget it	-1
flavor just passable . cracker too thick , not found topping soften it ..	-1
i really enjoy organic foods , so when i came upon this item i thrilled they making organic popcorn- especially newman own , brand i've liked past . i agree other poster , flavor bland almost flavorless . there other brands organic popcorn i've found more recently far better . don't waste your money so many them !!	-1
purchased these my sons lunch box , can't it , they too salty . he always happy veggy booty , what he'll continue get	-1
only recieved one instead 12 boxes amazon not able fix- still waiting remainder orde	-1
because tummy troubles , my doctor ordered me very bland diet . well this stuff just what doctor ordered , it almost completely tasteless . i can't give it one star which qualifies hating it , i can't hate anything pasta one ingredients , but it not good . it makes kraft mac cheese seem very exciting ! i would not reorder would fear ordering anything else annie . this would only young children who hate anything taste it	-1
most strip either hard brittle or so tough they could barely chewed . they put no expiration date bags so i don't even know if i given old product or they allowed salmon leave processing plant this way . top this , they too spicy . my dog seemed enjoy it though . ahi tuna , other hand , great	-1
i very disappointed taste this item . not all what i expected splenda . it much too overpowering , strong when added your beverage , all you taste . instance , if added coffee , you not detect any coffee flavor , only splenda flavor . much too strong . i prefer subtle taste other coffee additives over this splenda product - without question !	-1
... who said texture this product somewhat strange . i love beef jerky , especially peppered hot spicy varieties . but this jerky lacks chewy-ness i expect quality beef jerky . this stuff kind breaks down little too easily takes mushy , grainy consistency . flavor isn't bad , but after reluctantly finishing first bag , i can't bring myself open second one . perhaps i wasn't paying proper attention , but i somewhat surprised learn this product originated brazil . i would not purchased it if i known this	-1
i picked up bag these my local health food store few months ago after hearing pirate booty great product . these tasted rather odd me i wound up getting rid bag quickly possible . puffed corn chocolate type taste just don't go well together my opinion . it might ok if cocoa all you could taste , but not case here	-1
i am really disappointed this beand they marketing this kids . 4% iron no other vitamins ?? childhood obesity epidemic proportions , why would anyone feed their children all these empty calories ?? it like giving them coke or pepsi breakfast !! ok organic coke but still coke !! i am sad because i heard great things this brand really like what they doing endangered species !! but they not thinking their target consumer children	-1
cautioned when ordering this product . what happened i ordered this product month ago , sent flatbread version instead clear tub bite-size version . i called amazon , explained my problem , they promised fix it sending me replacement . well , replacement came last week , it still flatbread . i'm not going bother call amazon again because i know it just result them sending me flatbread once again . flatbread itself tasty crunchy . i think seeds really helped put more complexity into flavor . you eat just flatbread snacks or maybe put bit peanut butter or jam top . it tastes very different than wheat , i like taste spelt quite bit . so please prepared receive flatbread version when you order . you may well just order flatbread version start save yourself couple bucks well call amazon straighten things out	-1
i trouble getting cups function properly without getting grounds my coffee . first i thought it my coffee maker but other brand coffee i use worked fine . sometimes it took 3-4 cup changes finally find cup would work correctly without getting grounds my coffee . most time i would just give up . again , other brand coffee i use never this . not getting this coffee anymore - i would comment taste , but i never got really taste it grounds all . donna - marylan	-1
after extensive research grains nutrition , our family added amaranth our staple diet . there not wide range suppliers amaranth we started purchasing bob red mill amaranth . well , honest , our experience this product it pretty poor quality . out 8 packages we've bought so far , we've return 3 outlet we purchased them due amaranth mouldy . i mean " open package you smell it off right away " mouldy . addition , one packages didn't smell mouldy but after we'd cooked it added it baby food we making , mouldy smell cooked amaranth very noticeable . not good , particularly we're using amaranth making baby food our toddler mouldy grain not really something you want include ankle-biter diet . addition , we found we hand pick stones , grit dirt each package very very carefully . seems they included bonus . ( note grain itself very small , stones , dirt grit very small too - but big enough damage teeth if they slip through cleaning process - particularly toddler teeth ) . this cleaning sorting process involves lot work , which we wouldn't mind so much if amaranth consistently good quality , but it hasn't . i say while , after our research , we'd recommend inclusion amaranth anyone diet , bob red mill amaranth grain not product we would recommend . if you no choice but this , very careful cleaning it hand picking stone , dirt grit out before you use it , make sure you check very carefully evidence mould both before after cooking . addition , i'd recommend checking retailer they refund you purchase price if product you bought off . so far , we've sucessful getting our money refunded ( when we receipt - we didn't once we didn't get money back time , but first time after we poorer but wiser ....	-1
this coffee doesn't anything special it . i like good kona coffee i think 2 stars really tells it all	-1
first all , tea chest disappointing say least . chest made cheep compressed sawdust then coated plastic like ' finish ' which makes box look like it constructed cardboard plastic . tea its self alright , sadly nothing special . this item arrived good 6 weeks after it ordered , all tea packets wrinkled crushed box broke after i opened it few dozen times . needles say , this product way disappointing all around .	-1
this coffee off , sour taste . it almost if it " went bad , " milk that past date . i only made one cup before throwing out rest bag . i certainly won't ordering this brand again	-1
i tried this once . you get same thing buying some popping corn your local grocery , popping it , pouring it into bowl , adding milk . this made me reluctant try other kashi products . frankly , i don't see why people continue pay outrageous price what amounts popcorn . ps . amazon should add zero star rating	-1
really dry just not good could . disappointment after using this companys other products	-1
we buying melita buzzworthy dark roast pods over two years quite satisfied . recently , they increased diameter pods enable them fit other machines . i also understand thet they increased diameter pod holder new machines they selling . time melita made these changes , i believe they also reduced quality coffee their new pods because it just not taste nearly good . accordingly , i rated old pods 4 stars but new pods deserve only 2 stars . we now sampling pods other companies find good dark roast coffee	-1
date bottom shows expiration june 2007 . i would expect longer shelf life . also label shows mechanically extracted chicken meat . this generally equates bone fragments . i'm not confident this product	-1
" highest quality , wholesome ingredients " my aunt ida . seriously . how companies get away this nonsense ??? first ingredient corn syrup , followed closely sugar .

i bought this before snack store i love combination beef white cheddar . i figure i would try buy it bulk instead paying $2 pack store . however , i'm not sure if it stored too long warehouse or if it too hot warehouse , but cheese disgusting ! it dry crumbly this awful taste . i even opened second third pack see if it fluke , but all packages like this . beef stick good , however , if i order again , i'd order product without cheese . it just not fresh . ( yes , i check expiration date it wasn't expired	-1
anyone who really loves gourmet cup coffee hate this ! it burnt , bitter , weak , battery-acid ! , consequence , those coffee lovers may begin hate their new senseo -- but take heart ! many online coffee shops now offer decent delectable coffees prices rival this cheap swill . i don't specifically want endorse any one product or online retailer but google search " senseo compatible pods " you'll find several first page . also , please note while these may initially seem pricier , most third party pods work just one make 8-ounce cup instead two pods senseo brand products demand . you math it works out comparable costing cup joe .

i purchased these other day . i received them 11th jan 2007i ordered some other ones before , 100ct box slim jims which very good but unfortunately , they kept revising my order dec 19th until jan 10th so , i canceled order because it taking way too long . i thought these would just good . ($15 dollars more than 100ct box , but just good there 180 them , instead 100 ) . wrong ! these really bad . they all dried out hard rocks , top it off , they expire 24th feb . less then month now . i've never this problem amazon before . usually their stuff fresh . you not able return them either . once they opened you stuck them . i contacted amazon this problem they gave me little my money back . i not buying these future . amazon must these quite some time them so bad .	-1

" no sweeteners " , yet first ingredient listed after carbonated water " white grape juice concentrate " , which might not sucrose , but since when not sugar ? each small ( 8.4 oz ) 170 calories 41 carbs . i so excited find healthy fun drink , but this not it flavor ? lot like mountain dew . mostly sugar , yes there some lemon it , but it hard tell it meyer lemon opposed some other type . example food manufacturers slipping very unhealthy drink into market " 100% juice , no preservatives , no sweeteners , all natural " -- better they should say " drink this make sure you get fat type 2 diabetes !!!	-1
great looking beans . unfortunately , packages also full drug store beetles , common pantry pest . i could see them soon i opened box . why they not catch this bob red mill	-1
i thought this would full dried fruits nuts ( other words , healthful ) but it really just sugar laddened bits hard fruits only flavorless peanut pieces . i given local food bank all but one package i opened which made me feel so unwell it now rubbish . i am truly very disappointed this product . it description belies it reality . if sugar contraindicated your diet .... steer clear this product !! it low salt low fat but so over sugared actually nauseating . it too bad because it sounded delicious so nutritious . all i say yuk !!! i suggest you leave this product alone unless you think high sugar good you	-1
i hardly eat this all salt , it leaves you thirsty it so bad . ingredients list reads , literally , " 100% organic sweet corn , sea salt , nothing else " . they need make it " 100% organic sweet corn nothing else " , they'd probably something really great . it i'm stuck 23 1/2 bags salty corn i'll give away	-1
i beat this mix longer than 10 minutes suggested , it still too runny even stay my angelfood cake pan . it baked flat disgusting rubbery texture , completely inedible . when i very nicely wrote my concerns request product refund , customer service person said they could not give me refund , said " thank you your understanding " -- huh ?? i'll never purchase any more their products	-1

i got this gift person who appreciates fine teas , this undrinkable . fact , it unsmellable . i opened tin , smell overpowering clearly not natural . smelled tasted like handcream . yes , i actually tasted it . furthermore , tea practically powder teabags cheesy - quality you'd find no-name tea dollar store . tab simply said ceylon tea . it looks like " bentley " got stuck load crappy teabag seconds , sprayed them jasmine perfume stuck them fancy tin . i gave it one star tin . if you even tiniest discrimination when it comes tea , don't buy this one	-1
i never eaten these , because well , they're not vegan . they amazon vegan section however . whey not vegan it very first ingredient	-1
first , quality tomato products should never packed plastic . high acidity may cause plastic leech into food . then , these pooly packed amazon , 2 orders -- both arrived cracked open amazon just throws them box , so they crack make nasty mess . sauce , well it tastes fine , but i think it not well balanced , very acidic , we feel horrible after eating it hours . simple good ingredients , so i'm not sure what it making us feel sick	-1
while flavor unique , three five packets nuts rancid ! say i am disappointed understatement . unfortunately , this not first time i problems freshness food products purchased amazon . now , one two non-rancid packets . i got through one few days , i working other ... them i realized i major head-fog , you know , like hangover , but without anything drink . i gave up nuts it went away . me , that tell-tale sign additives food . not good choice someone chemical sensitivities . i purchased this sd recommendation . but it complete utter waste money me .	-1
got deal machine , love concept . but every senseo coffee i tasted absolutely horrible . i've tried 4 oz one pod- way too bitter so 8 oz 1 pod ... still most awful coffee i've ever . normally i drink gevalia , but i use folgers sometimes or millstone ... i don't think i could drink this stuff regular basis if someone paid me . all purchases i've made amazon , this first time i've ever felt compelled give feedback . itself speaks volumes	-1
i second other reviewer comments partially hydrogenated oil kellog using kid cereal !?!? it year 2006 , time start making these cereals healthy without trans-fat ridden cheap oils !!!!	-1
sell date package less than month . so they would not go bad , i felt like i needed personally eat more than i would . i retail store i need bit more time new products . this costly mistake . also , " wholesale price " business itself same amazon price except amazon gave free shipping discount coupon worth ten bucks ! cool deal beans amazon ! retailer , i would think i would able get better deal betty lou or get reasonable sell date . very tasty addicting	-1

i tried really hard like this stuff . you know , organic all . elbow macaroni fine but sauce gummy , pasty tastes like cheez-whiz . if you like cheez-whiz , you love this mac cheez . if not , pass it . i'd given it mikey but he doesn't live our house anymore . my recommendation make your own scratch . it not difficult it so much better .	-1
this type mac cheese pasta doesn't produce much elbow mac cheese . other than , it tastes same . good stuff	-1
tastes just like regular skippy i.e. unnatural texture because it contains palm oil	-1
i ordered loose tea tins received 6 boxes tea bags . only labeling box barcode sticker tea tins , which incorrect . when calling customer service i only two options -- return tea bags or keep them overcharged . there no follow up , so there no way know if i would receive correct product if i ordered again . price gone up 20% mean time . rather than without tea ( i can't buy brand where i live ) , i kept it . you can't get your money back if you over charged , you can't complain it anyone who cares . i never use amazon grocery again if i help it , i suggest you same .	-1
this bar would great if it wasn't so full sugar . it gives me sugar headache .	-1
" without any sulfites , preservatives , hydrogenated oils , artificial colors or flavors . " ... but not without great deal sugar high-fructose corn sweetener . like previous reviewer i bought these costco . brought them back due sickly-sweet taste . there so much added sugar it getting little difficult taste berries . if you prefer berries au naturel or just little extra sweetness , watch ingredient list these . sugar second ingredient weight - corn syrup fourth	-1
i didn't like them , too sweet sticky . my dog likes them , though . these just didn't it me .	-1
i so very disappointed this cereal . it taste very sweet . if you look ingredients , it filled sugar , corn syrup more sugar . i counted 12 ingredients really just forms sugar ! it also loaded salt . i would give this zero stars if i could , because it more sugar than most " sweet " cereals . why mislead public into thinking they making healthy choice when all you doing serving sugar new label adding little bit soy package ? absolutely ridiculous	-1
bought dozens different varieties these - all arrived way past expiration date terribly stale . don't chance it - i'm not only customer who this problems these products	-1
almonds slightly seasoned ' barbecue ' kind flavoring , which subtle but nice . cashews , other hand , hard believe . taste conjures up images me them stored semi-pervious containers paint-and-finishing room my high school industrial arts class . they really awful , any lover cashews appalled	-1

i love most jack links jerky products , however , i disappointed this product though it all heat - flavor lacking true pepper taste . it tasted like bunch powdered old hot spices not true fresh pepper cure . i think mistake most people make hot peppers not removing seeds before using , this give bitter well hot taste . i not given up jack links - just ordered their turkey jerky	-1
i thought these would slightly sour , like dried cherries i enjoyed past . no -- hfcs high fructose corn syrup -- so these taste strangely sweet , like weird raisins . they ok if i cook them oatmeal or if i'm really hungry , but i wouldn't buy them again . if you looking tart dried cherries look elsewhere	-1
i purchased two these packages mid jan 2007 . i only finished one box ( four ) am finding 1 out 4 packets caked . due apparently small air leak packet so moisture get ( only my personal theory ) . i just pound packet knife handle break it up use it anyway but it problem . they known it now long time , seems like they would solved problem ....	-1
i drink lavazza coffee nearly every morning local restuarant . when i saw this amazon , i assumed it would great -- but it isn't . even though this sold " drip grind coffee " , grind way too coarse drip coffee maker . result you need use nearly twice much coffee get decent cup . decent good it gets -- not great , not even very good -- just decent . illy ( admittedly much more expensive ) drip grind delivers much nicer , smoother cup using 1/2 much coffee -- so mabye it not all much more expensive long run .	-1
it arrived rancid mold all 4 jars ... not so great . i purchased there other products enjoyed but not this . pretty gross overall .	-1
my wife bought these me i just putting them my morning cheerios like madman i said , " hey , these good ... where you get ' em ? " " oh , amazon ... you believe they only $17.00 ? " silence . i just looked her , " you nuckin ' futs ? gimme those things . i'm going put them into our safety deposit box our bonds , our living trusts , my favorite hot wheels ... " blueberries good you i would suggest eat them regular basis , but price these things simply absurd . i look like i'm wearing my shirt says , " stupid " ? i don't think so . i'm sure you get frozen blueberries less hey , fresh always good , if you can't get frozen or fresh , get hostess blueberry pie . sure it sugary feel like you've got leadweight your stomach after eating it but pie only . 50 cents .. these little blue suckers $17.00 . that more than my whole wedding cost . just kidding . i'm not cheap . actually , i'm not cheap all , but i like money i refuse pay $17 some humiliated looking berries ... geesh	-1
wish i would paid attention this one , previous review . cost what you get outrageous . only reason i gave it one star because there no place give zero starts . don't waste your money like i !!! find more economical product ( plenty more choices amazon btw )	-1
i exact same experience " heather " shown below . they sent me less expensive non-organic version this product twice then informed me they couldn't guarantee when problem would fixed . remember strawberries cherries every list crops containing most pesticide . now add freeze dried snacks concentrated . finally , take these concentrated levels place them small child or toddler body their pesticide exosure goes through roof . math . note amazon : this great product fruit " nothing else " its ingredients . please retain it get it right benefit scores us enjoy providing healthy treats our kids .	-1
i don't recommend any baxter soups . these terrible . waste money . not buy again . amazon i'm beginning see why item sale , you want get rid them . zero stars	-1
it almost seems like i received different soup based other 5 star reviews . broth thin , mostly cubed potatoes very fishy smelling . don't get me wrong , it edible , but i won't ordering case this flavor . i'm still waiting receive mushroom blue cheese flavors	-1
these little mealy or grainy , but ok . pretty high carbs though	-1

my product should delivered month ago . this very bad buisness think you ship something whenever you feel like it . i am paying customer should reinbursed some way mistake your copany made .	-1
i trying these change pace turkey jerky i normally eat . they taste ok ( nothing special ) , but several medallions ( least 3 bags so far ) ' crunchy ' bits them . i suspect it gristle , or possibly small bone fragments . not pleasant eat . i may just gotten bad batch ( other than crunchy bits , i'd give these 4 star rating )	-1
i bought this just try something new . i love peach mango flavors , this sounded very good . i think it good drink , but whether or not i am able think better because it up debate . i doubt i'll buy these again if only because they quite pricey . 12 small cans ( liquid volume only smidgeon over one cup ) over twenty dollars ? it close enough $2 make it not cost effective get vitamins minerals this way . taste good , but i lots other healthy drinks taste just good less than third cost . but now i know , this drink not me . if you like good-tasting nutritious drinks cost lot money , this one you !	-1
these absolute worst crackers i ever tasted . if styrofoam could served box it would taste like these . save your money	-1

pro : no trans fat . con : no flavor . basically tastes like cardboard . my children won't eat it	-1
i gave it one star concept . i'm fan dave hot sauces . his combination smoky barbeque flavors straight heat always gets my saliva going . but this spray disappointing heat . fact , there nearly none i could even discern . it also poor flavor . it tastes like bad watery vinegar . so why buy stuff if it doesn't taste good or get your endorphins pumping ?? oleo-resin habaneros which supposed give spray heat like come out solution pool up top bottle . so instead homogeneous red color , you get blood red color floating top pale yellow color you shake furiously get spray looking normal again . i called dave it they told me that typical behavior ! i excited this sauce because i always wanted way evenly disperse sauce onto pizzas , but all i got over-priced spray bottles filled something i really can't describe edible . i'd fill it sauce but it'd probably just clog nozzle . it also intended use natural pest repellant . dave suggest spritzing some your garden keep rabbits bay . i've never tried so i wouldn't know if it works claimed . i hope it or there'd no need this product exist all	-1
this product came me packed bags , not cans . disappointed	-1
i am always looking quality nutricious treats my teens . i bought samplers see if anyone favorite . sorry say we just not like any these . little too spicy we looking crunch got chewy .	-1

i thought these gummi bears tasted funny , like there perfume them . i eaten other brands gummi bears ( or gummi bear wannabes ) , these not taste anything like those . flavors not very distinct or fruity . texture also very different not very palatable . i know these vegan gummi bears not contain gelatin , i assume why texture so different . however , i eaten brand ( sunny bears ) gelatin-free " gummi bears " , their texture very different , more like jelly candy . i would buy regular gummi bears , but i am allergic dyes i can't find any dye-free except these sunny bears . after i wrote amazon customer service product explained them i could not stand eat any more wanted return them , they immediately refunded my money - no questions asked - even though product not eligible return because it grocery item . i impressed	-1
" contains 50 percent more caffeine than other gourmet coffees " this because it not arabica beans , which beans quality coffee brewing . it rubusta , cheap mostly vietnamese " filler " coffee mostly found ihn supermarket blends such folgers , maxwell house , etc . flavor burnt twigs but you get more caffeine . that pretty much robusta . i guess it ok since most people who go into starbucks ask vanilla caramel almond suger drinks rather than caring coffee ... or it because they've never told there big flavor difference arabica robusta they incorrectly believe if they order without all suger flavoring they'd taste folgers ( or shock) ? if you like coffee - good coffee - stick arabicas . if you like good coffee flavor also lke more caffeine then just find lighter roast arabicas . if all you want caffeine you'll look smarter if you avoid markeing silliness shock buy nodoze .	-1
i love blueberries , both fresh dried , but these sugar added which makes them far too sweet my taste . dried fruit always naturally sweet , added sweeteners just turn them into pure candy , instead naturally healthy snack . thumbs down this one	-1
i've tried several brands gluten-free pizza crusts , i bought ener-g my latest product exploration . huge fan many ener-g products , i thought this one would slam dunk hit . how wrong i . ener-g pizza crusts too thin , dense , heavy , very little taste . you would think " thin " " heavy " would contradictory , but that what i really mean say . contrast , kinnikinnick pizza crusts light fluffy , such outstanding declicious flavor . i would strongly suggest buying single package ener-g pizza crusts your local health food store first . i made mistake trusting ener-g this product before i bought whole case it . it expensive lesson . but , nonetheless , huge thanks amazon offering so many gluten-free products . here us , we just starting become familiar how many people affected gluten	-1

if you dont like mangos , you not like this drink . it not taste like " organic " mango , but rather , it tastes more like " essence mango " you would smell air freshener . this mix pretty well cold rum . i would suggest you find this brand locally try it before you buy it . this water not taste like water you would get asian countries . i cant really explain why either	1
zico coconut water tastes natural it coconut . if you never coconut water before i would suggest drinking one before buying pack 12 . some people may say it aquire taste , but i think most importantly it all depends what culture you raised . i started drinking coconut water ever since i baby . it very healthy low sugar . currently i give it my [ ... ] son part his snack instead high sugar content orange juice or other juices	1

i tried lose weight long , o , time . also long , o time , i seen newpaper advertizements this tea . it seemed ridiculous me first .... i mean , lose weight drinking tea ? this idea just much credibility me some those sauna belts , ( which help you lose weight full 24 hours .... after which time it comes back again ! )well , last year i getting pretty desperate . i somehow managed lose 40 pounds .... drinking only regular tea , instant coffee , home-made lemonade , eating only bird eye vegetables turkey . ( fact , i invented " turkey diet " ! it very simple : eat turkey , fall asleep ( tryptophan ! ) ..... if you fall asleep , you can't eat , you see . variation , i guess , " hollywood diet " , which used only weekends .... because most people need stay awake during week go work ! ) anyway , this diet worked me .... but it pretty boring .... took most my free time away , .... turkey expernsive ! i gradually stopped this diet , gradually got back 20 those 40 pounds . i looked desperately way lose weight .... but drinking tea it just didn't logical .... however , no other method presented itself inexpensive drinking tea .... after all expensive ( but delicious ! ) , turkey , it seemd good way go . now , this particular tea itself quite expensive -- $43 4 ounces , ( sale .... ouch ! ) .... but 4 ounces lose tea would make least 60 6 ounce cups , ( 360 ounces ... i'd course adding my own water sweetener ) .... so i figured , why not ? ( well ... because possible bad taste , that why not . i've tried herbal teas past , -- delicious exception jasmine tea -- thoroughly disliked each one . ) but even so , i decided risk it ... i've tasted far worse things than herbal tea , after all .... so , year ago , i sent away it . when wu-long tea arrived , ( lovely little transparent green plastic bag , lined aluminum foil , giving impression crushed green diamond ) , i made it drank it . hmmm , ( or rather , " mmmm ! " ) not bad tasting all ! it tasted like best black tea ... kind , ( other than jasmine ) , i like best . but ,,,, tea so expensive , i decided not drink it too often .... owner " healthy refrigerator " , ( one loaded vitamins , which i take only emergencies , because i can't afford keep buying them ) , i now this " healthy tea " , which i put refrigerator keep it fresh ) , sort keep vitamins company ! i throughly read literature came tea , however .... noticed many people praised medicinal qualities this tea , it weight-loss abilities . hmmm .... i decided i happily gotten more than i bargained .... weight-loss tea one which helpoed other health problems . nice get such bargain -- but , $43 4 ounces lose tea , it still quite expensive . so , after first cup , i restrained myself drinking it , quite some time ..... actually , i didn't drink cup until two weeks ago ! i beginning feel if minor cut i gotten week before somehow let infection , ( though cut itself didn't look infected . ) anyway , i beginning feel very , very , very .... .... ... ..... two years ago , fact , i hospitalized infection .... very same infection killed my mother month before ! my mother , hospital , said she " felt like vegetable " , , gotten same infection , i knew how accurate description really : i so weak , then , fact , i trouble raising my arms above my head ! now i felt it starting happen again ! my first thought call 911 . but my second thought , strangely , concentrated those glowing testimonials i read other customers who used wu-long tea . i figured i'd try make myself cup .... if tea didn't work , i could always call 911 .... after all , though i felt very weak , i didn't feel totally paralzyed .... yet , anyway . but i knew i make drink tea fast ..... before total weakness engulfed me . i feel up doing so ? yes .... i ... took my time , i ... i very careful , ... i .. i stayed very near telephone i made tea .... just case .... i managed make myself cup tea .... wait it cool down bit .... drink it . within hour , feeling weakness left me ! , this writing .... taking place full two weeks later .... weakness , ( presumably infection ) , not come back ! (oh , if only i courage buy this tea .. o .. years ago , give it my wonderful mother !!!!!! )now , i'm not saying this tea work miracles everyone , every circumstance . tea not transform my looks those princess grace , ( whom i consider most beautiful woman all time ) , not cured me very slight case myasthenia gravis ... neuro-muscular ailment which i since age four . i doubt very much it made me immortal , i know fact it not granted me super-powers , or ability fly , or transcend time . ( no one ever accused me not good imagination ! : ) however , upon drinking tea , my feelings infection , ( feeling weakness quite different myasthenia gravis ) , go away ! i don't remember what other testimonals this tea .... but i'm sure , now , least 98% them true ! perhaps there no real " fountain youth " . but this tea ... which seems cure many ailments , most probably helps one lose weight well , if taken often enough , seems very close second . ponce de leon would happy it , i'm sure . i don't know if it help everyone ... but i know it helped me , ( probably other people who gave testimonials , too . ) second cup tea -- even whole 4 ounces lose tea -- certainly less expensive than going hospital ! those budget , like me , wu-long tea , it seems , destined used luxury , and/or emergency . but i really feel it belongs every home ..... just like aspirin . -- emergency use ... please take same precautions i : 1 ) sure you energy actually make drink tea , 2 ) near telephone , so you call 911 , case tea doesn't work you . tea work me , above circumstance , anyway . elixir life ? perhaps perhaps not , depending person circumstances . all i know , me , under circumstances described above , it certainly seems saved mine !	1

i originally bought these my kids but they didn't seem like it so i started eating them . they delicious only 70 calories bag . they make perfect snack it keeps me away cookies , candies other desserts . yes , they salted but nowhere near salty potato chips or cheetoes .	1
this some amazing sweet corn . it dried but also very light airy , it really taste like sweet corn great snack . why only 4 stars ? one they put salt it some reason , which really detracts overall taste - if they'd leave out salt maybe tell you add some taste ( neither us would add any , it doesn't need it ) , they'd real winner . second you buy case quantity , while it very tasty snack , it going take long time , waste lot cabinet space , get through 24 packs it - especialy salt content .	-1

i disagree person who gave this product only one star . i find i beat cake longer than box indicated needed bake it longer . i mixed my first one using my portable hand mixer which really too small this product . second time i used my new stand mixer whip attachment . it more than doubled volume after beating it 10 minutes longer than package suggested i beat it high . cake filled my tube pan top i baked it 5 minutes longer than package suggested my first one bit underbaked . my husband , who not celiac , loves this cake also . we can't tell difference this one regular angel food cake mix . i also used 1 teaspoon gf vanilla 1 teaspoon gf almond extract instead using 2 vanilla . i like almond flavoring angel food cake better , but personal preference .	1
tastes pretty good , but it still not starbucks . i like ordering this free shipping grocery coupon codes amazon runs occasionally . last time i got $10 off 2 cases . then its worth price . their chocolate espresso beans great	-1
i'll preface this stating i love hot foods i am not affected them , so i understand other reviews saying world kitches hot spicy too spicy . this not case me though . i found it perfect blend spicy sweet . i really enjoyed it ordered more . i got kick where i thought i would try all spicy jerkys amazon . i found this one i liked most , because bothe flavor fact there lot thin cuts meat , which made it easier eat . this kick , so if potential problem you may want go something milder . i say i even hotter , but if you enjoy some flavor your spice , you may want give this try	1

this tastes great , i love it my coffee , even used it pancakes . it really doesn't give me spike blood sugar , promised . only negative packaging they using . during shipping , some seals underneath lids came off , bottles leaked . i probably lost tablespoon ( each ) 3 6 bottles . lids don't really fit bottles , either . they pop-top , but if you use it , syrup sometimes leakes out under lid where it attaches bottle . if they could fix bottles , this would definitely five-star product .	-1
i enjoyed eating cerial . whether if it before school , work , or just snack . what i like this they come varieties ( frosted flakes , froot loops , cocoa puffs , etc . ) , so i won't eating same thing every time , which also good . if you're rush morning want something grab go within 15 minute period , i recommend this you . also you don't waiste your dishes , because they come their own plastic bowls . my only problem they so small , after 10 spoon fulls , it all gone . sometimes i'm still hungry after eating one packet ( i'm skinny too ) . true this contains trans fats , what breakfast item kids enjoy eating doesn't contain them ? not very many items . maybe eggs , whatnot . also if your kids somewhat active somekind fitness activities , those " deadly trans fats " should worked off end day . using fat free milk cerial would make situation better also	-1
i use this espresso regular coffee drip machine . it loaded flavor , full rich flavors , no bitterness . i purchased it twice , first five pound bag , then 4 one-pound bags . i think individual bags not only better value but they stay very fresh until you need them . i no trouble 5 pound though , it delicious first day last . i highly recommend this coffee	1

these slivered almonds excellent addition salads . i'm sure they good lots other things ( baking , stir fry ) , but they definitely make plain salads seem lot more gourmet . they're perfect size/shape/cut this purpose . shelf life also great . especially if you store them freezer or fridge you should good more than 6 months . bit pricey retail , but you can't beat amazon 6-pack discounted price . i'm stocking up	1
wow , we've never so much macaroni cheese long time ! annie really , really good . this doesn't need additional milk or butter , sauce easy-to-squeeze out paste foil package . it tastes great , makes great receptacle some creativity your own too . tips enjoy it : - just boil plenty water , six-cup requirement minimum . - drain quickly , put pasta back hot pot . remaining heat just right melt thick cheesy sauce into macaroni . don't rinse pasta cold water , it make it hard sauce combine well . - all deluxe versions animal rennet free . annie faq very specific which ones use vegetable rennet ( not all ) but amazon isn't picking up information . i tag really vegetarian ones " animal rennet-free " whenever i . - try blending sundried tomatoes , fresh tomato , olive oil , garlic , pizza peppers , salt , freshly ground pepper , touch balsamic vinegar into paste . this really complements mac cheese gives it new , gourmet taste still doesn't take away " mac cheesiness " it . - tabasco chipotle sauce makes great addition adventurous . smoky taste tempered creaminess	1
i just got case these - my 2 year old i just introduced ourselves ' fruit leathers ' , which we love . i figured i'd look this up it considerably less expensive per bar than buying 8-pack store . my daughter absolutely loves these so i ! we're planning bringing them treats when we go across street play kids who stay one my neighbors . my daughter even told me they're now her favorite treat . i feel fine knowing she getting something that really tasty sweet but it not gonna kill her too much sugar corn syrup	1
great product when you need just little extra stock/broth . it won't replace my use swanson because it would too much open 8 packages 2 quarts stock soup etc . but it great making pilaf etc . or when you're just little short quantity needed	-1

good cereal if you like something other than flakes . it doesn't get mushy like them . however , this product doesn't provide minimum vitamin content some other breakfast cereals , important consideration when one considers how vitamin deprived many us ( carbohydrate stuffed ) .	-1
upon arrival , i read nutrition info myself cereal box pleasantly surprised find they better than amazon listing . they 6 grams fiber ( balanced soluble insoluble fiber ) 1 ounce ( 28 gram =3 /4 cup ) serving only 5 grams sugars , all only 100 calories . all this isn't worth much though , if they don't taste good , right ? well , they good , very yummy , even out box . they rather like " life " cereal , regular flavor , just bit less stripped good stuff taste . whole grains really shine through they tend stay crispy milk much longer . i enjoyed bowl them topped just fine bit honey so flax seeds i topped them would stick not sink bottom , bowl plain milk , also bowl made into " muddy buddies " healthy version . i bought these initially make recipe " muddy buddies/puppy chow " recipe healthier ( using alternatively sweetened chocolate , freshly ground almond or peanut butters some date sugar toss after coating . these would also great alternative choice other " chex " cereal recipes . i like them so much , i give up my usual choices cereal provide same , or less , amount fiber twice calories also soak up too much milk bowl . give these try , they won't replace some worst offending sugar laden " kid " cereals no one noticing , but these really good choice tasty , always handy those " chex mix " recipes healthier spin . if sugar addict really needs more sweetening , just let them top these better choice sweetener your own choice , not giant company choice what makes them most profit . best all , we something affordable we like taste without supporting these huge companies ruining our health economy , well putting family farmers out business . i can't think any reasons why i wouldn't recommend these .	1

this product benefits organic whole grains environmentally responsible packaging , but it also my favorite cereal - flavorful super crunchy even if left milk while	1
these bars fairly good " healthy , " yet they lack flavor texture many other granola or fruit breakfast bars . me they taste like equivalent whole grain rice crispy treats ( if there such things ) added cranberries some ginger . combination cranberries ginger aid flavor , but bars " stickier " than i expected . all things considered , though , they seem healthy alternative more caloric bars	-1
we love peanut butter toast breakfast - but my husband would not eat anything but skippy , no matter how i pleaded . he not like natural peanut butter all . when i found this store i so happy - he loves it ! i too , it tastes great , like skippy but without all crap original . highly recommended	1

annie creamy deluxe shells real aged wisconsin cheddar made all vegetarian ingredients even organic pasta . sauce made cheddar cheese , cream , whey , dry milk , natural flavors annatto color . 12-ounce box enough two six people depending how hungry you time . we serve this side dish many meals normally get four six servings one box . when making pasta , use large stockpot filled halfway water because if you even use medium large saucepan , it might boil over . instructions say use medium saucepan , but i can't recommend personally it always boils over . once you pasta cooked , all you add packet creamy delish cheese sauce . this probably only box macaroni cheese information where get " green " bumper sticker . i also like cute " rabbit approval " sticker annie homegrown products . they all delicious ( not overly salted ) you feel good eating such healthy product . ~ rebecca review	1

first , remember you'll getting lot cereal when you order this value pack - months worth if it just one or two people . fortunately , it doesn't too strong or strange flavor so you shouldn't get tired it . i suggest adding sliced banana or apple , or even shake honey-sweetened cereal it not most interesting cereal eat its own . my biggest recommendation - not eat it plain soy milk , grain flavors reinforce each other point bit nauseating	-1
