" unknown name " while driving very old established roads it tells me turn onto road actually elevated overpass i am driving 30 feet below . program actually wanted me get back freeway making u-turn off ramp ramp . i used microsoft streets all these same areas it much more usable . delorme very confusing frustrating . i'm sending it back full refund	-1
acrobat 5 so buggy i thought i'd give adobe couple product cycles before upgrading . should waited longer . there improvements v7 : better look , better commenting , ability add text actually prints , far better ocr functionality . but other basic functions way worse than v5 : some word documents easy convert pdf v5 not convert v7 , seems something font license issues . installation nightmare repeated re-installation required get past system hangs , clashes standard security software , endless errors automatic update feature . new product activation makes this even more pain because too many re-installations force you activate phone . despite my already low expectations adobe , this product disappointment . acrobat 7 , adobe , usual , charging top $ what any decent company would consider embarrassing mess even beta version . ( reference , my system window xp pro , pentium 4 3ghz , 2.5 gb ram )	-1
computer i now(about 500 mhz)is faster than my last one , earlier version plus ! worked well my older model . however , my current model can't process most programs available , so i just deleted whole package . i intend get faster computer near future , use superpack time . features look pretty cool , but i can't give it favorable rating this time . however , when i see how it would work faster processor , i may re-rate my review	-1
i qualify this review saying i not own pm 8.0 , so i cannot fairly give rating , despite overwhelmingly negative reviews . i only relate personal experience norton/symantec products . i own used pm 6.0 since ' 01 when it still powerquest instead norton/symantec it worked very well , though gui bit quirky . i run it 2 drives , one 98se xp pro , pm loaded 98se partition it everything i needed both drives . trouble , version 5.0 , afaik , not compatible xp since m$ no longer supports 98se , we problem , houston . currently i am using mobile drive bay switch drives needed . if i get drive partitioning software product compatible xp , it most assuredly not anything produced norton/symantec , based these reviews personal experience norton/symantec products . i first bought computer ' 98 used norton antivirus 5.0 . time , norton probably best antivirus product out there . it worked flawlessly i used recommended it years . no more . i purchased copy symantec system works 2005 right after it released . long story short , i no longer use norton products because i got tired system crashes stability issues caused unstable bloatware system resource hog it become , am currently using competing product very highly rated but not common shelves big box stores . there one lone symantec product i still use --- windoctor , which not installed my ' puter but ran cd needed . adios , anything else produced norton/symantec . it ain't worth headaches when there much better products available less coin .	-1
why newer products getting slower version . i still love version 5 . it not forever open up web browser .. update : i using version 7 now several months .. i am glad say i am now lot happier . granted it still uses lot memory . however , new features it compared version 5 , makes upgrade worthwhile . however , watch out .. there several features adobe took out standard version only pro version ..	-1
i bought this software primarily so i could create slideshows music other special effects . since i got it , i nothing but problems . first all , it would not install completely my computer . techs adobe could not figure out problem . after i reformatted my hard drive , i finally got photoshop install properly . then problem . when i burned my slideshow photos vcd , they came out just awful ( unlike adobe demo video showing perfectly created slideshow . ) boy , i deceived ! i cannot say this software all bad . it nice job correcting exposure errors digital photos . however , if you want create neat slideshows , photoshop elements 4.0 not worth cost	-1

don't take my word it that quote title recent post excoriating this irritating increasingly bloated product slashdot . warned : adobe not learned its lesson , despite outcry followed release version 6 , this latest release acrobat continues adobe aggressive trend intruding into your desktop environment , again , version 6 without providing easy way undo damage once its -- fact , it now nearly impossible . like earlier releases , this version acrobat adds startup macros new toolbar buttons your existing applications adds menu entries your desktop " right click " menus . adobe argues these conveniences , but they entirely unnecessary ( most us " printing " adobe pdf achieves same result , much more convenient , more natural model ) , clutter what most users either too-crowded user interface ( those who don't knowledge or patience customize it ) or carefully tuned one ( those who ) . unlike many well-behaved applications provide obvious ways avoiding this kind intrusive disruptive behavior ( e.g. through simple checkbox option settings dialog ) , acrobat " option " disabling this behavior , once deeply hidden setup process , now almost completely absent . disable " convert adobe pdf " button mysteriously appears outlook mail editor , example , one sure choose " this feature not available " " microsoft outlook " option under " acrobat pdfmaker " under " create adobe pdf " . simply deleting button using outlook toolbar customization feature not work : it comes right back when editor next opened . similar problems arise word , excel , visio , project , internet explorer . there simply no way get rid never-used " convert adobe pdf " " combine acrobat ... " entries appear desktop context menus files ( even if one installs none acrobat pdfmaker features ) . technically inclined wishing repair some damage acrobat 7 , there complex but largely effective step step instructions available web , but even authors these driven despair version 7 : ( " adobe really pushed boat out acrobat 7 managed screw word royally " ) . short , acrobat make mess your working environment , there no way completely fix it , even partial fix pain ( not well documented ) . ( this may seem minor issue , but if every application followed adobe reckless example , our working environments would start look like strip malls , crowded features screaming our attention point where it hard find what we need when we need it . one great strengths personal computer desktop users configure it ways suit their needs ; no application should interfere . ) experienced acrobat users also notice this version continues frustrating trend acrobat ( most other adobe applications ): it yet again slower launch than previous version . fact , my 2 ghz pentium 4 , it takes longer launch than entire visual studio . net development environment , longer than boot sequence windows xp ! there other minor problems well ( arbitrary rearrangements menu tool bar items , etc . ) but these two major flaws more than bad enough . unless you really need latest acrobat features , you should probably avoid this upgrade . if " improvements " this release any indication where adobe plans go future releases , it may time start looking elsewhere tool digital document management . fortunately , there no reason all upgrade . version 7 offers no usefully new features , so you ( should ) avoid this one ( all costs )	-1
effort boost their file numbers appear more comprehensive , creators included many very low resolution images they " artsied " or " roughed " up dirty polaroid-transfer effect , or split up into 5 small stagger-stacked slides , which they must hoped would excuse poor quality original image . example , if you search " tiger " , you get 165 results , but only 86 animal , ( not one 20 images 10 toy tigers , or 5 images one tiger-striped chair-cushion so ) , those 86 , 80 crusty effect applied them . other 6 tigers taken out those same 80 images clipped out their background give you floating tiger clump grass or tiger head ( but , thankfully , not " dirtied " up transfer effect ) . out all , there not one clean image tiger its environment . here example . search " sunset " yields 247 results . these , 163 crusty polaroid transfer effect applied , 70 same images duplicated ( much smaller ) sloppy stack 5 slides . there two clean sunset images . these typical results . numbers don't mean anything ! this product stuffed multiple images toys , frankly not-so-attractive people hard angles , old low-resolution stock photos achieve 150,000 files . would it killed them include one clean , print-resolution image each category ? perhaps we could without 50 fake slide images ( talk dated anyway ! ) order get product worth around	-1

microsoft office handy . files you open , edit create it ( most notably . doc , . xls , . ppt ) probably closest universal compatibility among all your high quality options . it ( relatively ) intuitive . it pretty broad array useful functions . it also obscenely expensive , considering fact you get all these things -- . doc , . xls , . ppt ; intuitive interface ; functionality -- free . i hunted up openoffice two years ago when i decided several hundred dollars insane price pay ability write papers , make basic presentations , or put together spreadsheets . i looking basic functionality , but i pleasantly surprised ; openoffice most neat tricks , too .

easy language 16 only useful if you're already familiar language you wish learn . i've studying french months before buying this product found it helpful when i'm getting rusty . only problem it hard make out what said because sound not clear . recorded speakers also don't bother slow down give you chance understand or repeat what said . this good cause it like listening actual french speaker not robot , bad if you actually want learn how pronounce what said . it also go over basic french grammar but totally useless if you don't already know basic french grammar . i also tried use this learn japanese . unlike french , i'm not familiar japanese language all so trying use this product learn it became nightmare . if all you want learn how speak language it romanized version words phrases make it easier sound them out . unfortunately basic japanese grammar japanese alphabet all written japanese . instance , grammar section it past , present future " i am " it written english then beside it it written japanese . you can't click them it sound out you . japanese alphabet section all it japanese alphabet you click them sound them out but you really no clue what you sounding out . so it teaches you nothing reading language but test they want you take purely japanese . i want learn how read , write speak japanese so none this would problem if it actually taught you how read , write , speak japanese ! so my guess would you really familiar japanese ( not romanized(romanjj ) version ) already order use this product . because my experiences this product i would say get it only if you know languages you're interested use it refresher nothing more . since i am familiar french this product pretty helpful but if i used this starter language i probably would quit . i'm searching amazon better japanese books . so if you want actually learn language look books language tapes cd 	-1

i bought this upgrade because i thought it would let me share my contacts . it says so box , but it doesn't . it works just like old contacts which you can't share others except if you export it . no live sharing . why couldn't they make it so i could put file my server ? or secure site ? then all my office work off one contact list . 50% or more time business contacts can't found when you search contact . it like business contacts add doesn't work outlook . or you add contacts , save it , email saved email address then go find contact later it gone . also , lots times when you try send , email won't send , it stays outbox . repeatedly you open hit send button but it won't change send status . now , if you leave it outbox , sometimes fools program into letting you send other email . or sometimes you forward send .. geez , what waste money this upgrade . we won't using it any our other computers we haven't bought if new computers we ordered .	-1

i trusted this software would what it claimed so let down its lack performance i am dumbfounded left speechless . during backup process i selected 15gb info backup , spanning 4 dvds . everything looked fine , except two ( 2 ) simple errors i received , indicating those related files may not copied/backed up properly . i figured no big deal , 2 files/errors out 15gb , i could handle . based upon false pretenses my critical info backed up properly ( simple pictures , videos , mp3 files financial files include previous years tax files ) , i then proceeded slick my drive . remember , only 2 simple , benign almost inconspicuous errors during backup process . everything looked great . during restore process , i then received numerous errors , each them requiring me click ' yes ' when asked if i wanted proceed . i got tired clicking yes around 100 or so mark decided click no . when you click ' no ' , everything undone ; there no ' ignore all ' function so i sit through every prompt got tired it decided proceeding 1000 files answering yes would involve too much pain me . i then selected smaller group files restored , only ' my documents ' folder but ran into same situation . eventually i ran test small folder restored still ran into errors but pressed through . hardly any files received error free those issues never restored . my guess approximately 2/3 or 3/4 my files not restored course none really mattered made it . i latest update applied program , so should not cause . i would better slick my entire hard drive without going through backup process i would nearly same place but without experiencing all headaches , frustrations investment hours , no days my time . program recently purchased microsoft inclusion vista os , i imagine . it well microsoft product , it fails deliver upon its promises	-1

my last roxio product " easy cd creator 5 . " when i switched mac i naturally expected " toast " mac version this product . i am extremely disappointed find crippled video editing features my ( many years old ) version cd creator miles ahead what they include most current up date version " toast " which i unfortunately own . it allowed me edit video clips , create several levels customizable menus , customize size compression , burn dvd which played my standard dvd player . toast create one uncustomizable menu level , no editing , locks up every time you drag file into it . they ( product description ) say it reads mpegs but it more like it freezes every time it sees mpeg . it doesn't even read every mpeg reliably . only thing i find roxio adds toast isn't my old version cd creator more enhanced mp3 music features ( which isn't what i bought it ) . i may better off using " parallels " combination cd creator . i am sorry but compared roxio cd creator ( which basically same price ) , toast seems designed total idiots . i always thought mac software better working multimedia	-1
turbotax what looks like it would geat feature -- ability import data your financial institutions so you don't enter all your stock sales hand . some cost basis ( how much i bought shares ) empty , so i go enter them manually . no big deal , just took few minutes . however , when i went e-file , program flagged these changes " overrides " computed values , refused let me e-file return . equally bad if i just leave fields empty -- they came charles schwab , then it looks like i got stocks free , huge tax bill ( incorrect ) . so , after many hours trying see if i could change field so it would not flagged " override " , i determined other upset users turbotax forums intuit.com i out luck . i'd print it out mail it . special reward , turbotax doesn't even tell you what attachments you need include return you now forced mail . help screen says what it prints out tell you what include return . that wrong . so , main reason i got turbotax e-file . now , i get print it out , find out all crap i attach return , mail it , then wait weeks months get my return . thanks , intuit !!!! saddest part hr block sent me free copy taxcut before i bought turbotax . i should used before i spent $30 piece crap like turbotax . won't again	-1
isn't this mac product ? i thought mac products supposed ( ) stable , ( ) easy use . this product stable , ( once i upped my ram 2gb ) but 512mb it brought system crawl . but far ease use--i'm not dumb guy ( although my kids may argue point ) but this product really victum itself . it too hard " express " audience really intended ( my opinion ) only profression final cut pro users . other words , if you use final cut pro work , want something your home-mac , express version great value . you already know it people paid you get used it . but if you're imovie user , pinnacle systems studio user , adobe premiere elements 2.0 user , this product seems like i'm trying fly space shuttle . how you output wmv this product ? you it any pc-based products , oh , they also output quicktime so why apple hangup wmv ? i recently asked apple forum " how you picture picutre ? " i got great response experienced user . " it only took couple minutes , just these 6 steps ...

i using this product now almost year . only reason i insist using it because i feel really bad wasting my money . first , this not worth $300 bucks . there only still pictures sound . no movies or any fancy graphics , so why price ? second it very repetitive it not advance very logical way so you recognize grammatical structures behind ever changing sentences . third , sentences you repeat over over not practical all . you keep memorizing thins like " boy under airplane " or " ball boy head " . initially i thought , well this because it progresses very slowly which not necessarily bad . but then i took look last lessons ; you just keep repeating useless senteces like these without real things used dialogue . i cannot recommend you course because i spent so much this one i not want try again get disappointed . don't fooled wonderful reviews like i . this definitively not worth 300 dollars . it not even useful basic converstion . i learned much more simple travel books cassettes library . ah , if you think repeating these structures alone you understand german grammar ..	-1
normally i might wait install new software upgrade , but i just got new laptop thought it would best use office 2007 new vista operating system . i wrong . you would expect multi-billion dollar company like microsoft could put out powerful bug-free piece software . but after month using office 2007 , you get distinct impression this software not ready public release . microsoft should ashamed . i don't know root cause my problems , but i stress i am running clean install office 2007 vista , so there shouldn't any software conflicts or issues . so what my issues ? list long : -- my biggest concern ms word constantly hangs stalls . it making editing document very painful . i suspect problem when i put images or visio diagrams into document . but something old ms word able without issue . oddly , if i colleague open document save it out word 2003 , problem goes away ! what ?! it killing my productivity . -- when ever i cut paste old document , word hangs 15 20 seconds . often formatting margins my new document go haywire . i keep spend ton time fixing things . this never happened old word . this time killer . -- every few days , outlook 2007 starts telling me it cannot display my email folders . uh oh ! i completely restart my computer see my email again . -- outlook 2007 breaks many graphic emails people send -- they look like mess . it because outlook 2007 not render html correctly since it uses word engine , not internet explorer display email . i no idea why microsoft this , but they got fix it . -- many issues old word 2003 still haven't fixed . if you place image , it often hard get it appear correctly . why can't they solve this one ? -- while most office programs new ribbon interface ( which i like ) , some programs like visio 2007 not . so you remember how use two interfaces . couldn't microsoft find time money update all its programs ? give me break . -- few occassions visio 2007 , my files failed save correctly . first i thought this must my fault , but it happened me few times can't coincidence . few times i've gotten error message lost my work . ug . -- word excel 2007 use completely new file format . so anyone you send document 2007 installed ( which isn't likely case ) . get around this , you save it down 2003 file format , but then you end up two files your hard drive -- one new format one old format . what pain ! also , there definitely seems issue office 2007 opening older office 2003 files . could cause many my problems , but there no way i avoid using old files . they should worked harder compatibility . there good things new 2007 . i like new interface design new features outlook 2007 amazing organizing tasks sharing your calendar . but i don't think it fair microsoft released product so full serious , serious bugs cost me hours hours extra work . i didn't spend hundreds dollars beta product don't think public should suffer . surely they afford better !	-1

i " upgraded " norton 2006 version internet security virus protection software online . included norton systemworks . i used norton anti-viral software exclusively several years without any major problems . yes , i always remove my previous version , before adding new software . even though my internet connection via private satellite antenna , it took almost two hours product download install . then when i rebooted my laptop ( new high-end sony vaio windows xp ) , it froze up during startup . i won't go into all hassle involved , but after three removals downloads over period several weeks , it became apparent there something seriously wrong norton 2006 product . it caused crashes almost daily basis , updates always took excessive amount time . customer service no help all , company refused refund my purchase price . i've since switched different brand anti-viral internet protection software no more problems my computer . after this experience , i never use norton products again . only reason i gave this 1-star rating because it lowest rating available . it should actually minus 5 stars aggravation time money wasted	-1
summary : i wasted lot time trying make this work , i eventually went back other products . theory , integrating virus checker , firewall , spyware , data backup into unified suite ( like ms office word , excel , powerpoint ) makes sense . however , this software package seems poorly made ; it not work very well me . hardware , os , primary software used : 1 . dell lattitude d620 laptop 2gb ram , windows xp , ms office2 . dell x1 laptop ( thin/lightweight ) 2gb ram , windows xp , ms office3 . dell dimension desktop 4 gb ram , windows xp , children gamesprior virus/spyware products : lattitude x1 : nortondimension : freeware provided our isptheory : since microsoft makes os office applications get infected viruses , their product should better integrated os . there synergy integrating several related software applications . lesson : well , after series terrible experiences , i hope others benefit my wasted time : 1 . instead loading most program cd downloading small updates , this seems load only small part program downloads huge files . this made me feel product shipped unfinished . you this separately each machine since it hides downloaded files then deletes them prior finishing installation . this took better part afternoon . 2 . i purchased 3-pack license . installing activating software 2nd 3rd machines required series very annoying steps involved logging into their website broken links . it finally required phone call . least , phone support experience good . 3 . product promises minimize performance impact , improve overall performance . lattitude dimension ( powerful machines ) , there no difference performance , but we could notice slightly slower performance x1 . this later verified when we uninstalled ms windows onecare replaced it product . 4 . product difficulty updating . it opens small message box asks you click update onecare , but takes you webpage only works 1 4 times . 5 . except first time , data backup always several errors i manually fix . this very rarely happened other data backup software i've used . 6 . some applications , firewall asks everytime permission connect internet although application list always allow this connection .	-1

unlike versions up no . 6 , this version require authorization . this means single use version can't loaded multiple computers . adobe informed me this not bug wanted me buy multiple copies eventhough i am only using one computer time . this version forces you take off old legal version order install . when i found out my legal version couldn't used , it forced me reinstall version 6 , this took almost hour install , reboot , un-install reinstall orginal version . why adobe only company forces this ? their program installation don't even skip one set four numbers next . they force you type dashes numbers . if you multiple computers stay away anything above version 6	-1
i used both paperport 8 paperport 9 deluxe over year so i am qualified report . both pieces software some form severe incompatibility windows xp pro . i cannot really get version 9 operate . everytime i try its like cold molasses . click ... wait .... wait .... wait ... wait ... then lock up . i'm very experienced . i've working pcs since 1991 . every other piece software i've loaded works very well ... except paperport 8 9 . theory paperport 9 should fine because it converts all scans pdf which more or less universal file format . however theory lot better than reality . support nonexistent scansoft . if you pay $19.95 per incident , you still not get solution . scansoft forum always either not working ( bad sign ) or it full people complaining software lack support . unfortunately there not lot alternatives , but doqments looks promising . avoid paperport unless you money time waste	-1

i purchased turbo tax after reading reviews here ... someone mentioned glitch , but someone else mentioned work around . bottom line , if you sit down all your records whole turbo tax start finish one swoop , you're fine . but if you need start stop while completing schedule 2 business aspects your tax return , get ready huge problem ... it doesn't let you back ! i went their website where they both work around , report if you update your turbo tax ( very easy ) glitch fixed . not so , it nothing me . then i tried workarounds ... i got back once but next time i tried use work around few days later , it not work . i ended up call accountant 1 week before 17th thank goodness i able get appointment . also , if you business don't understand some tax workings , like depreciation , it very difficult translate your former accountant previous year work into new turbotax . it not set up way , so you need know what you're doing . i college degree lot stick-to-it-ness , but i could not figure out sure i entering things correctly . then , it didn't matter anyway , i couldn't get change anything end . finally , make sure you save , save , save you go ! while doing my turbo tax spent couple hours already , i logged into their website get some support . when i " " ed out internet page , it closed my turbotax screen i'd opened my computer . guess what ? it all lost i start beginning . before i even impacted " glitch " later . this program not remind you save when you close , or ask you if you want save , so sure save all time ! so , good luck anyone who tries this . me , it huge disappointment i am returning it amazon refund due glitch . i honestly don't know how they sell something such obvious problem .	-1

unlike years past , hr block ( founded guy named bloch ) decided charge $16 each e-file , federal or state . only one version , " premium federal+state+e-file " includes " free " federal e-file state e-file ; but version costs $70 , so there no free lunch all . seriously , $16 lot pay e-filing . there websites give you completely free e-filing ; my favorite taxact ( taxactonline dot com ) . taxact , you get complete federal plus state package $7.95 , which includes e-filing . or you use their standard package prepare federal e-file free , * no * income restriction ! i don't work any these companies , nor any tax-related company , nor any such entity . i just don't think it right hr block charge customers such ridiculously high fee e-filing , whereas people e-file free elsewhere . btw , if you use taxcut prepare your return , you'll use hr block e-filing service if you want e-file ; you can't just take your file website expect website it you . i used taxact past they very dependable . you find reviews taxact products major magazines major websites . good luck	-1

i used spyware doctor since version 3 -- almost three years now . i liked interface simplicity -- power . but others pointed out , including industry reviews , version 4 . huge drain system resources . my pc would take anywhere 5-9 minutes completely boot up , spyware doctor using almost 100% cpu whole time . also , my computers would frequently " freeze , " which turned out spyware doctor randomly zooming 95-100% cpu no reason all . but version 5 , things so much worse . 3 weeks ago , my pc lost their ability connect internet . browsing slowed crawl , frequent timeouts " server not found " . i spent days phone my cable company , my router manufacturer , trying troubleshoot . i re-configured my entire home network over over . i never made connection onset problems my updating sd5 . it only after finding pctools support forums i realized problem spyware doctor . i removed program my pc -- problems gone . i full internet connection full speed again . spyware doctor 5 causing massive problems users . pctools rewrote program ground up , company says , improve resource drain caused version 4 . but apparently it rushed market even though beta testers reported many these same problems weeks . i've uninstalled this software am basically wasting my subscription losing money . other users right -- pctools indeed " auto-renew " charge your credit card without warning . this huge red flag . i lost hours , days , dealing problems caused this program . many users reinstall windows completely . it easy get caught up hyperbole negative reviews . but don't just take these face value -- read spyware doctor forum pctools ' website . these problems real . it doesn't look like they're going addressable anytime soon . they've issued couple version updates , even removed several program protection " guards " , but these haven't fixed problems . they're not giving any kind timeline or explanations users . my advice -- stay away now . but keep up forums pctools ' website . when they finally get issues resolved , this should really strong spyware program . * pctools also criticized offering " free spyware scan " their website ( actually download sd ) , which find spyware your system but refuse remove it until you buy subscription spyware doctor . this kind sleazy bullying isn't normally characteristic reputable companies -- most give you actual free trial functioning software	-1

i switched tax cut years ago after turbotax ( 2003 ) implemented their idiotic validation scheme . i figured i doing my part punish intuit / turbotax . all those years i've happy tax cut . not this year . i found some major bugs which cost me lot time . i my return , but numbers seriously out whack -- i know i didn't much income ! going back through interview process didn't turn up source added money . only checking actual " forms " i find several copies 1099-misc forms hidden interview process , adding same data non-hidden copies , i double entering data . there no easy way recover . i eventually wipe installation start all over . call tech support absolutely no good . person other end didn't seem understand problem " hidden " copies forms going into calculations . if those hidden , what else it doing wrong ? i'm not quite sure how deal this next year . go back turbotax ? hope tax cut fixes its problems ? or go human tax preparer ? whatver my choice , i'm not looking forward it .	-1
this program sucks . i used it last year thought it unwieldy really confusing ( i.e. unlike turbotax other programs , there very little transparency system ) . then i bought it again this year because store i went out turbotax , i needed get my taxes quickly . this year even worse than last year - not only it still unwieldy irritating , but it gave me figures simply not make sense . results federal return ok , but it gave me figures would cost me over $ 2,000 taxes i not owe my state return . i ended up going online double check my results using cheap ($10 ) online service recommended ny state tax website . within 45 minutes , i cleared online source , got results made far more sense . i no idea what happened taxcut , but i suspect they may missing field somewhere line - this problem noted number others reviews variety sites . i not buying this product again	-1

i installed quickbooks pro 2003 my new computer running vista small problem . so , i bought upgrade 2007 since intuit says it works vista . it not . software crashes odd times . it also crashes when attempting call up invoices accounts receivable report . it reports out memory errors closes two six times each day . i set up my old computer , which runs xp , so i use new software until they fix all glitches 2007 version . i recommend not buying this version if you running vista os	-1

i used version 8 this product decided upgrade even though all reviews here warned against it . boy they right . this thing terrible . after installing windows xp sp2 , soon i started program it crashed . now every time i try scan using my canon scanner , it crashes every time . product useless . wish i never bought it ! not buy !	-1
i bought it , installed it , tried it , uninstalled it returned it ( course i reformat my computer get things back way i like them ) . reviews say it big improvement . maybe so , but i no desire learn whole new way doing things again . i spent years learning keyboard short cuts putting up product i thought inferior wordperfect ( how i would love reveal codes option formatting ) . prepared steep learning curve . if you use word lot proficient , you find it very frustrating . menus different , key combinations not all same . you customize it , but honest , i don't care . vista office 2007 , i think microsoft finally screwed pooch . i'll stick old versions ( xp office 2003 ) now . my next computer mac running os some sort open office application . i enough .	-1
reviewer says : " but final tax forms i needed file not included cd-rom package . turbotax instructed me get them using " one-click update .

i used turbo tax 20 years loved it . past it user-friendly , efficient complete - it even printed out all forms i needed - ready send irs . usual , i purchased it this year . format changed isn't nearly user friendly years past . you manually select walk-through feature , section section it very easy miss sections . when i got end , it wouldn't let me review errors until i updated version . but , i don't internet home couldn't update . it crashed my computer 3 times before i skipped review totally . ( god only knows what else i skipped process . ) when i went print forms - again it nagged me software inferior needed updated . again , i skipped it but pages printed out nasty watermark saying forms weren't updated couldn't used . i can't use these . i can't send them irs . so , i find irs forms manually insert information myself . so , why i spend money software ?? why would they sell product you can't actually use ? yes , it'll " prepare " my forms . but , what good if i can't print them out ? why would they sell product already so obsolete you can't use it without contacting company version ? absolutely - run - don't walk - run run run away this product . don't buy it because it simply doesn't work . i won't use turbo tax again . they lost faithful long time customer	-1
i bought this product because positive member reviews outstanding review cnet . however , i just bought new dell inspiron e1505 shipped windows vista home premium , zonealarm 6.5 flat out incompatible new os . i downloaded zonealarm 7.0 flat out incompatible well . i'm sure this great security suite windows xp , but beware if you vista . there seems no update their website when zonelabs release vista compatible zonealarm . ( they mention something " after january 2007 " , but it march , crying out loud ! ) so there my purchase price good product down drain	-1
i bought vista upgrade my dell computer . i tried install half way through set up , after it uninstalled my old programs , i got message abort . abort left me damaged media program , thus far i spent over $400 trying re-connect damaged files programs . my best advice wait until microsoft gets " kinks " out vista program then buy upgrade	-1
much worse than previous mcafee editions . i dropped norton some older desktops due its lack support w2000 . i then went free edition avg anti-virus , which ok but slowed things down . thinking " you get what you pay " i sprung mcafee which ok past . edition i purchased 3 licenses . i installed one these my wife xp laptop well one my desktops ( luckily , she still talking me ) . 2007 mcafee suite makes avg look like free ferrari . absolutely terrible performance , coupled mediocre interface . perhaps only poorer-performing way assure you'll never get virus , spam , etc . would hit your motherboard hammer . this slow down your computer ( even worse , unpredictably ) . if you lots email outlook or outlook express expect open your mail box , then long break before you thing ( it rechecks everything spam ) . there partial workaround this , but users shouldn't search workarounds . every web action now noticeable latency -- well slower applications when mcafee grinding away background . if you liked your current anti-spam , kiss it goodbye -- mcafee may not let you keep it . mcafee ( like norton ) also difficult remove your system . what prompted this review ? today it appears update process rebooted my computer without requiring " yes " me . alternatives , i wasn't able get kaspersky anti-virus run older machine -- somewhare remnant norton persisted ( possibly document tagged symantec etc . left over day working them ages ago ) . however , i get it running laptop its better than norton-mcafee-and even avg my opinion . so , consider kaspersky or vendor . if doesn't work try avg . it interesting see how mcafee responds -- they've really shot themselves foot this release	-1
buyer beware : this program critically impair your system ! internet loading drastically crippled . expect frequent system choppiness due automatic downloading background processes . there no way close mcafee get around these drawbacks other than uninstall . i am going return this first thing next week . i gave them few weeks improve performance patches upgrades , but nothing changed . if only i read reviews ahead time . bottomline : if you don't mind these side-effects , all means purchase this program ; mcafee solid protection . but there easier ways get protection	-1
i didn't use this particular product but version came my computer which slow but not end world . problem i them they aoutomatically renew your subscription without giving any warning they going it . i 2-year subscription they send me e-mail 2 years later saying they charged my account never telling me i auto enrollment ! when i called complain they course someone who couldn't inderstand me i spell my e-mail address three times told it would take 3-5 days refund processed which crap because i work online store its easier void sale cheaper vendor refund same day ! i asked manager twice , second time they came back they nerve ask me if i interested upgrade subscribing their magazine , put never-ending hold until i gave up 37 minutes later which probably plan all . so i called my bank put stop payment automatic payment . now i am searching protection program calling their customer service before my purchase see how it goes	-1

this far most basic editing/creative package i ever used . i using every version print shop since some their early versions . i print shop 22 haveing issues printing ms vista . i figured i would able purchase one broderbund similar products ( one made vista ) it would similar style usage . wrong . i not able import other print shop projects , printing limited , no drag drop feature other programs , limited editing , formating text off when copying one document , sizing pictures text boxes while editing projects limited dragging corners only , on-and-on . i tried use broderbund tech support page , but it very limited their faq section . try asking question or emailing help ; good luck . i fumble this product awhile ( only because i print more than one page time , because ps 22 vista only allows this)and wait until next compatible version ps comes out windows vista . i would thought there would least patch now . i think they may made zoom way it now allow newer , better versions . i hope this helps ...	-1

this upgrade disaster . first all , word , view markups function default now , so you go through change all settings hide markups ( most people my department not want see those distracting colors balloons not need edit doc any way ) . however , if you want send document not tracked changes embedded -- because you don't know which version word recipient , you can't take chance them seeing all those comments -- you go through document again , view markups , reject comments , accept changes , resave . it kind difficult explain , frustrating too . people think if they can't see it , then recipient won't able see it either . this good explanation microsoft help forum : * not displaying * tracked changes isn't same * not * tracked changes . even when using word 2002 , changes still documents , anyone could see them just turning display . all happened 2003 display automatic . way documents which changes not displayable remove changes documents entirely -- you must * accept or reject * all changes . nothing you view sufficient . if you need retain record changes , you'll maintain two sets documents : one changes , which * never * leave your office , " scrubbed " sent out . still , it big problem more unnecessary work than 2002 version . also , outlook new default view quite different than before . panes set differently , so you go view/reading panes change positions . then you ungroup items ( breaks weeks very annoying ... most people don't like , although i guess some people think it looks more organized ) . oh , microsoft - can't live it , can't live without it . almost forgot ... buttons/icons prettier this version , we all know makes huge difference . yessss ! pretty buttons ! i die happy now .	-1

this most god awful method learning language i ever encountered . my jaw dropped when i saw nasa other government agencies using this software order learn foreign language . if truly case then i demand my tax dollars back . it bad . reason i gave this software shot because their marketing campaign asserting it absolute definitive method learning new language . you're probably looking it same reason . first , you should know you purchase set flash cards your local bookstore it just effective any rosetta stone softare costs 90% less . i used this software when i borrowed it friend order see if it better than my current method learning mandarin , which i'll get into later . i opportunity make copies this software when it my possession but decided against it . not out fear piracy penalties , just plain because i would rather not this software than copy it . that really how awful it . imagine if your parents tried teach you english only teaching you noun/picture association ? it wouldn't work unless you learned proper english grammar proper syntax . if you learned verbs other things . this program assume you know all your chinese numbers automatically . very beginning picture little girl show up it verbally say ' one little girl ' mandarin ... however it not tell you which word means number one , which word means girl , so . it guessing game , not learning experience . all positive reviews i've seen any rosetta stone software amazing seem absolutely phony fabricated me ( especially rosetta stone japanese page ) . please beware , there no better way prove what i'm saying true other than trying demo yourself . i am sure it bad full retail version i used week . absolute best method i've used learning mandarin pimsleur audio cds . ( i've never tried berlitz pimsleur other competitors , but i'm sure they better than rosetta stone ) . i used mandarin i ii so far pimsleur , i am able hold impressive conversations other fluent speakers mandarin . great thing it pimsleur explains everything you , allows you say it out loud , there no brute memorization involved pimsleur , only natural language assimilation . just ask yourself this , when you learned english child . you learn learning how read write first ? or you learn how speak listen first ? didn't you learn syntax first then use what you learned formulate your own sentences ? that exactly how pimsleur taught me mandarin . i surprised how i able create my own grammatically correct sentences pimsleur only few lessons . go ahead try demo any rosetta stone language . it should enough keep you away rosetta stone favor any their competitors . i've heard good things berlitz others , but pimsleur my opinion absolute best .	-1
i liked software itself . first year i used it , i thought i'd start regular tt customer . then it april 17 2007 i tried e-file . servers would not respond all day . there no admins reached support sites or forums ( except one who said " i don't know what problem i nothing tell you " ) . one major failing this software it cannot automatically try connect . if it fails , it says " try again 10 minutes " . which i've all night . now - i miss my tax deadline spent 6 hours my computer trying get connected . mail not option now my car gone . this major failure company utter lack support , since their officials apparently couldn't bothered come work tax day offer us any solutions . i not buy again .	-1

i using turbo tax years just i jave used quicken years . one big plusses me it deductible , program places values items you give charities imports directly into turbo tax . it deductible stand alone program until 2006 when it went intuit online entries . you could not longer buy program install your pc . this would ok but then intuit would not allow you see values placed donations until you purchased turbo tax . intuit thinking bottom line rather than customer . i hated told intuit my feelings - no response i expected . but what heck , i entered my donations through 2006 when turbo tax 2006 came out i purchased it amazon good price . after installing turbo tax i went see what my donation values import values into turbo tax my online entries . nope - no . not only it deductible buried turbo tax very clunky slow link start program but there absolutely no way import . after much searching intuit support pages - always chore - i finally found page explaining - no import . but if you like you get voucher unlock online values then manually re enter information into turbo tax ! what crock . top using it deductible turbo tax slows my duo core pc crawl . i look elsewhere next year	-1

when i considered purchasing this product , i confused see some people thought it great , others thought it terrible . i couldn't understand why there such discrepancies reviews . after i bought it i understood : some things it , it works fine -- no problems . however , there many major bugs software , if you need one buggy functions , you'll sorry you bought it . examples some problems : 1 . if you burn audio track entitled " blue fog " nero give it title " fog . " 2 . every time i run backup , it tells me there write error , but backup seems ok . 3 . i backed up every file my drive , but when my system crashed , there problems prevented me restoring my system . 4 . it blue screened my system one time . 5 . many commands poorly or not all documented . example , wave editor declipper function , but there no documentation how use it . so , i'd recommend you look instead competing product . good luck	-1

i used norton virus protection norton internet security several years . i am currently running nis 2006 . my experience these products not good but out fear i just renewed my subscription . since then i nothing but trouble nis . since my renewal within grace period i decided request refund . i tried this on-line but found it impossible waste effort . their web site support useless their product . norton internet security i clicked support linked their web site . once there , i tried apply refund but their system not recognize my subscription renewal order number . it recognize my product order number nis 2006 but not refundable so no help there . i gave up requesting refund decided contact support . if you click " contact us " there 2 options , telephone or email . telephone support down because earthquake taiwan . i decided try email . i clicked email got following security alert : there problem this website security certificate . security certificate presented this website expired or not yet valid . security certificate problems may indicate attempt fool you or intercept any data you send server . we recommend you close this webpage not continue this website . click here close this webpage . continue this website ( not recommended ) . how ironic ? i know i their site because i navigated there clicking support nis . you would think internet security company could maintain their own security certificates . i'm not surprised though because everything symantec designed make you hate them . their product abysmal . it bogs my system down crawl , disrupts performance other applications hogs system resources . if you put nis your computer you'd better get used staring hourglass icon long periods time , especially if you don't tons virtual memory hard disk space available . nortons ccapp retards start up forever won't shut down when you want log off . recently i reinstall my windows xp operating system . after i major problems nis uninstall it . it then i realized how much better my system ran without it . i already paid my renewal fee so i downloaded reinstalled nis nothing but trouble since . i tried leave feedback symantecs web site but typical them , not work either . i wrote long complaint , then clicked submit . error message came up saying go back correct highlighted areas . when i clicked back button all text i typed gone ... just because i failed enter subject line feedback report . i'll damned if i type all information back again . if you buy nis you'd better hope it works first time . if you think your going get good support symantec or anything out their website - think again . oh , btw beware , symantec enrolls you automatic renewal unless you go their website un-enroll . once they your money just try get it back . symantec sets up road blocks so you eventually just give up frustration . this how they make their money rather than making good product .	-1

federal returns this generally usable product very poor user interface help system , state returns this product falls below bar " usable " . i used principle competitor , " tax cut : past found it generally poor ui , but it significantly better than turbo tax . some examples poor user interface experience : * if you enter employer id number w-2 attempt retrieve it internet retrieve fails , then you asked re-enter same id number when you enter w-2 information manually . * investment sales : i 20 stocks i've sold over past year , but window only shows 3 time ( scrollbar ) . * form page , schedule d-1 ( continuation form stock sales ) displayed screen scrollbar if number items exceeds window height , but scroll bar would not let me scroll bottom 2 entries . printing these out however show them * when entering stock sale , you indicate it worthless which turbo tax tell you it set sale date 12/31 , regardless what you entered compliance irs rules . so my next stock worthless i tried not enter sale data knowing it would just override it , but program insisted i enter sale data , only then immediately override it . * entering federal information usually clear enough , but obvious lack effort shown state returns ( pa my case ) . cryptic questions asked no explanation no useful help . example " enter adjustment income , indicate type adjustment -- choice type include oid , abp , etc . no explanation what these !. it not clear whether amount " adjustment " should absolute or delta . requesting help brings up screen irrelevant topic ( penalties early withdrawal savings ) . * my state return , it dragged me through 3 screens every stock sale i made . ( 20 them - so 60 screens ) . since it already info federal return i doing nothing other than clicking continue over over . much better would present me table all sales ask me check information there . * it transferred information my stock sales my federal my state return . however i only part year resident state it made no attempt either calculate , or warn me , many sales would not taxable events state because they sold when i not resident state . conclusion , while turbo tax ultimately help me get job , i think i'll try going back taxcut next year	-1

i concur review points up problems adobe new " license manager " method activation . when you pay much you this app , or entire suite , you should not faced complete lockup should you hardware problems , or can't connect internet " location shooting . " i took one star off this egregious marketing tactic . said , this version photoshop superb , otherwise 5-star app . if you take time use tutorials included help ( used separate folders , chapters 1 - 4 classroom book , but no more alas ) , or get one deke mcclelland fine tomes all lessons , there nothing this app novice can't start use day one . today point shoot cameras packing more resolution , more manual control , into their functions , use photoshop becomes more than just hobby . you really " rescue " photos too dark , too bright , exceedingly color-shifted , " cut " folder still make prints . further , camera raw functionality allows anyone sufficiently functional digicam touch up snapshots into fine photography . warning : you need fastest processor you afford ( core duo or quatro superb ) , much ram your system take . there optional performance plug-in which maximizes performance systems more than 1 gigabyte ram . you need least much under windows xp get good performance out ps cs2 . if you use 2gb or more dual-channel memory , that even better ( dual-channel ram adds small boost when handling large file sizes , e.g. camera raw image sources ) . if you don't these , don't expect photoshop act fast . adobe bridge major improvement this version . it offers superior file image management functions , even batch editing images . you even perform camera raw adjustments right bridge . bridge perform batch processes while you edit photoshop . if isn't cool , i don't know what . if you doubt me , check out deke mcclelland photoshop cs2 one-on-one tutorial his chapter using adobe bridge . his video introduction ( included dvd book ) , chapter using customizing bridge , terrific introductions . if you're user versions 5 .

i'm not spider-man fan . i love powers , ultimates , supreme power , planetary other stuff warren ellis , brian michael bendis , et.al . so when i bought this , i wondered if spending whopping $49 would worth it . i wanted read straczynski recent run spider-man , but if i going spend $20 graphic novel , why not spend little more whole thing . that just what you get . addition getting straczynski 4-year run ( which includes spider-man evolution discovery his totemic powers ) , you get everything leading up june 2006 ( which just like 3 issues ago ! ) . all 1 dvd-rom . true , cons when it comes crossovers , you only get amazing spider-man stories reading it off your computer isn't fun reading actual comics -- but doesn't compare getting entire run . it like complaining getting free ps3 , xbox360 nintendo wii , because box didn't come it or you're missing one controller . $50 may seem steep , but if comics cost $3 now , so price like one or two months worth comics -- or 2 books , you get everything . it true , you just print out pages if you want ( so if you want abuse your office or school printer , go it !	1

you see other reviews above , studio series history buggy . you also hear lot people saying " this package so much more intuitive easy use than other ' powerful enough worth owning ' packages -- if only it more stable ! " i am one those long-suffering users ( 5 years , going back version 9 ) , finally version 10.6 i stopped complaining -- it now works i'd hoped when i bought it . $300 i spent other packages trying better wasted -- i kept getting frustrated interfaces 500-page manual couldn't clarify . i'm very sophisticated computer user most measures . i am turning all our old family video tapes cd into dvd . i use studio all editing ( not tried dvd recording -- just use roxio ) am now very pleased . if you own 10.5 then version 10.6 free download . one important piece advice would saved me lots problems : put every " project " you work separate subdirectory . if you 5 soccer game videos make /game1 , /game2 etc . series subfolders . if you edit those " jimmy great plays " proect , put it separate /jimmyplays folder . when projects same folder you edit them few times weird overwrite problems happen 10.5 . i learned this trick before 10.6 came out , i don't know if it matters any more but i take no chances . why i stick something where i admit version 9.0 " powerful but unstable " 10.0 " more powerful more unstable " ? because i actually use studio minimal reference instructions , when i use it things turn out i expect . now it become stable reliable i am very satisfied customer . so that how i got frustrated studio customer giving it 4 stars this review . i tell whole story so you understand other reviews frustrated people relevant older versions , but " 10.5 updated free 10.6 " really best choice out there now ... my unused expensive rivals studio my shelf prove . just keep putting every project inn its own folder !	1

i really surprised read some other reviews this product -- it we we've purchased entirely different programs . my experience this software , i've found it extremely smooth-running user-friendly installation printing , card selection customization second none . there perfect cards every occasion date we've customized them countless ways -- adding editing photos , moving text , sending ecards , you name it ! navigating within art studio very intuitive . printing cards sofware very easy on-screen configuration works great . unlike some other reviews , i haven't problem re-configure every time i print . we set it up once it . i've printed card stock paper , which turns out gorgeous , we've also printed quarter-fold plain letter size which also looks great works perfect size a2 envelopes ( this great printing option if you don't want buy card stock paper ! ) . i've used this software all my computers , recommended it many people , so far not yet encountered or heard any problems . i highly recommend it . it fun program , recipients love their customized cards , it save you money long run	1

i using microsoft operating systems very long time , , i still say this best system out there , many reasons . increasing amount linux mac users made claim they more compatible programs , less vulnerable virus hacks . response linux users-stay away linux , linux free reason . it compatible very very few programs it , number only decrease . gamers - rarley i see linux compatible game . just stay away this system . mac users-mac also lesser amount compatible programs . fewer fewer programs run them , like linux , number only decrease . only thing keeping macintosh alive itunes . which compatible windows . besides , when direct 10 comes out , it only available windows , making macintosh un-usable new games when next windows os comes out ( microsoft vista ) . computers also generally more expensive than windows . btw - you get viruses mac 	1
first , if you're thinking using these photos print , you may wish think again . most objects run 300-600 pixels width or height , or 1-2 inches 300 dpi . stretch them bigger than , they'll start blur and/or get jagged . also note , if you try export/save image hemera image browser select 300 dpi setting , browser may stretch graphic larger than it actual size , causing blurring jaggedness right out gate . you need use " use image full size " checkbox when exporting images . if you specify 300 dpi size , don't use checkbox , you'll get stretched image . example , first image collection ( pocket watch ) only 384 pixels wide . if you specify 300 dpi don't check " use image full size " box , software stretch it 642 pixels wide . stretching cause image look fuzzier and/or more jagged when you use it web site or print project . all said , if you're going use images web , they're great . you get almost all images you'd find their three " photo objects " collections , each which much more expensive than this single collection . difference photo objects collections offer 20-30% higher resolution ( i.e. first image collection 384 pixels wide , but 492 pixels wide photo objects ) you save photo objects images transparent backgrounds ( while this collection forces you specify color background ) . price , this good collection . there lots shots minor variations , so it may seem like duplication , but someone trying get something just right , slightly different tilt head may just what doctor ordered	1
nobody , i mean nobody , could more illustrator novice ignoramus than i . several months ago i given licensed copy illustrator 9 departing coworker used . wanting chance design departmental logo otherwise would've gone agency , i raised my figurative hand volunteered blindly duty . taught myself everything ms-dos turbocad , photoshop elements , not mention word , excel , powerpoint ( don't get me started latter program , argh ) , i figured i could tackle least basics illustrator 9 . loaded it my laptop , took it home weekend .... just lost my sanity -- several fingernails -- trying learn confounding program . i managed produce few logos , one which chosen . but egads , what big , stinky bear illustrator 9 wrestle . when i saw cs2 this live trace feature , i pleaded my workplace santa get it me , wow ! what overall improvement !! illustrator still not intuitive pick up ms office product , but this comes darn close . cs2 , they've given us " hot tips " -- little clues what some tools , pop up when you mouse over tool . intuitive menus nice too . also cool all text paragraph fill stroke features , which used huge boxes taking up valuable real estate screen , now condensed up small horizontal toolbar , like office products ... when you mouse over them , screen tips tell you how expand them . aaaahh ! finally some help dunces like me . live trace live paint unbelieveably cool . very first thing i after loading cs2 grab . jpg photo soccer ball off google images , within 20 minutes , without consulting any book or online help , i'd converted it into simple graphic image painted into 2 colors i wanted . but great guidebook , reviewer who suggested illustrator visual quickstart guide elaine weinmann dead-on . i've bought several other " highly rated " books try help me through confounding quagmire adobe products , so i've seen them all . visual quickstart book doesn't any insufferable " wanna-be-a-comic-novel-author " writing , focuses just basics . it very literal , step-by-step instructions . still there no substitute utterly excruciating process learning illustrator through experience . but weinmann book better than any i've seen yet . only reason i haven't given this product 5 because it still doesn't intuitiveness it needs . way it still " snobby " -- aimed pros , not folks like me who need occasional design stuff but not living . but this far , far , far cry better than illustrator 9 . absolutely worth money , just live trace live paint alone .	1

i installed norton antivirus 2007 immediately after installing windows vista , office 2007 other software new computer . installation ran smoothly . liveupdate ran automatically updated product without hitch . norton antivirus 2007 not only detects viruses , it detects spyware rootkits well . it inbound firewall , apparently some limited outbound firewall capabilities . it not protect against phishing , identity theft , or spam , nor it contain full outbound firewall protection . when installed windows vista , norton antivirus takes over windows defender windows firewall . i not expect latter ; symantec should made it more clear this product includes software firewall . norton antivirus integrates well windows security center . norton antivirus 2007 noticeably quicker both normal operation during full scans than previous versions . norton antivirus always performed well industry comparisons against other antivirus products . only other product i would use myself mcafee virusscan , but i always felt norton antivirus more aggressive job protecting my system . those you installing norton antivirus 2007 upgrade , i would highly recommend you first remove any existing norton security products using add/remove programs control panel . then , download run norton removal tool symantec site make sure it all gone . see comparison chart norton 2007 windows protection products this posting date , browse symantec site , click " norton 2007 products " under home products , click related link " view all products " then click " compare " next pc security .	1

ok , it big ( 4 cdrs ) . full install require over 2.35 gb . but it loads quickly offers nice greeting card variety pretty sophisticated card customization options all pages card . previous years , it also installs event planner . if you don't want use event planner you stop it starting windows going start / all programs / startup group deleting entry event planner startup group but if you don't similar program , you might find event planner useful . i found setting up this program my auto-duplexing ricoh color laser printer easy enough , so setting it up other printers likely pretty easy also . quality printed cards really astounding , even my normally " picky " wife thinks they look very nice acceptable any use . i suppose your results could depend your printer but if your printer currently prints nice graphics pictures , then cards should turn out very nice . i recommend using heavy card stock professional looking final product . cards default printing out 1/4 sheet size ( four fold ) format easily printed 1/2 fold size graphics text remain outstanding . i never experimented " partial install " would require disk swapping but save hd space , so i cannot if would nuisance or not . overall , there nothing i've found program i don't like .	1
i installed it three my computers no problem i used wordperfect before it vey user friendly . i'm not power user but basic things seen easier . i recomended . software came intructional dvd no how used un like microsoft counter par t.t his software more then what needed average person . it also comes some free download installing software your computer which you install all three computers . it come lots template you used . buy , buy , buy i say . lol worth it	1
i remember first time i used wordperfect , first time i used microsoft word . i couldn't imagine why anyone would choose vastly inferior word over wordperfect . years passed , now i find myself using ms word every day . i'd ground down thousands word users who'd picked it up powerpoint excel , who didn't enough savvy know how convert documents one format . wordperfect _always_ converted msword docs . msword never reciprocated . shouldn't told them which program mandate make customer life much easier ? each successive iteration , wordperfect introduced some new innovation , next incarnation , microsoft aped it . it got point where users would nod appreciatively innovation , then wait inevitable year-long interval microsoft catch up , then they'd buy . well , due outrageously fair price point multiuser license , i tried wordperfect x3 , it like coming home . it nothing short amazing . i went out bought copy my parents , they love it , too . now my brother , attorney , asked me buy him copy , since so many federal prosecutors he works wordperfect only , can't seem open his word files . more things change , more they stay same	1

after going insane new version norton systemworks 2005 , which doesn't even install , i decided finally swear off all symantec products . i used zone alarm pro some time . it not perfect , but it certainly protect your computer . i took plunge went full security suite this week , i've relatively happy . plus side , software works really well . personal firewall better than any you find , virus protection found phishing app norton not ( before i unstalled it ) . minus side , firewall problematic . i've page load issues ebay my own site which cgi script keep my images files hotlinked ( bandwidth theft ) . when i visit my site or any other similar anti-theft cgi script , images simply won't come up . ebay gets all messed up well . i haven't able figure out setting works , so i turn off firewall ebay few other sites , which kind defeats purpose firewall . this doesn't happen lot though , so it not annoying enough get my dander up . all all it far better investment than symantec products , so despite its limitations i would recommend this program . it lot options set , but they pretty easy get through if you computer literate . if you decide go this program you currently norton antivirus , you need uninstall norton before this program run . if you ask me if i preferred symantec systemworks or zone alarm security suite , there would absolutely no hesitation recommending zone alarm .	1

office 2007 nice step up office 2003 ( earlier ) it better visuals toolbar . e.g. instead just seeing worded commands toolbar where one clicks command then gets drop down list choose more commands , i.e. file , tools , edit , etc , you'll see tabs different commands toolbar . when clicking tabs , it sets up across toolbar , all functions particular tab . once viewed , you not only see words functions , but also , small example graphs images what functions . this only applies all applications other than outlook , which pretty much retained same look feel 2003the load times seem much quicker than what i 2003 version . outlook , setting up accounts , maintaining names addresses much easier too . only annoying part office 2007 comes mind , one only choose 3 color schemes . three " black " which really looks more like dark taupe or slate color , " blue " which looks more like light powder blue " silver " , which looks like light gray . my honest opinion , i like standard color look like previous versions my taste goes this , i only like black setup only	1

this software focused learning rules game . movement different pieces pawns demonstrated through assortment arcade-type games . there some decent books learning chess beginners , but learning through computer game program makes it much easier more fun . program doesn't contain any instructions , so some people may find it frustrating figuring out what beginning . however , there symbol top right corner , clicking which brings down menu which point navigating becomes piece cake . just knowing rules game enables one play chess , but not exactly win , so second cd this series ( learn play chess 2 ) continues where first one left off goes into different tactics strategies . software recommended 8 year-old children older - kids heart may fun learning chess this program also	1

i purchased panda internet security 2007 two reasons : price after rebates ( free ) fact it 3-user license . after switching mcafee norton ( subsequent 1-year renewal ) i decided either buy pc-cillin 2007 or try panda . ( 39.99 or free ... hmm ... ) i installed panda my laptop first ( after uninstalling norton internet security 2005 ) . no problem what-so-ever . initial hdd scan , panda found cleaned 5 files found my email inbox identified worm . i then installed panda 2 desktop machines no problems there either . panda found 3 traces spyware one machine nothing second . panda boots up windows xp quickly . it only given me couple pop-up messages ( one wifi intrusion , which computer my network ... i accepted it it never came back . other pop-up start on-line customer service or something like ... i declined it it yet come back . ) my laptop p4 1.8 ghz , 1gb ram , 32mb ati video , 40gb hdd . initial virus scan took less than 20 minutes , scanning over 250,000 files . not bad ! desktop 1 first scan ( p4 2.4 ghz , 512mb , 128mb video , 120gb hdd ) scanned nearly 300,000 files also under 20 minutes . desktop 2 quickest ( p4 3.4 ghz , 1gb , 128mb video , 80gb hdd ) scanning over 330,000 files 15 minutes . i am extremely impressed panda internet security 2007 . it everything i hoped it would . i would definitely recommend this product others	1
if you don't need outlook but need powerpoint , this great value . before , you student or teacher get good price ( full retail $150 now ) . office 2003 standard even ebay still going $175 plus . this not offer anything much beyond office 2003 but new ribbon format not difficult learn . also , don't worry file formats . you re-set default format prior formats so anything you send out read earlier versions microsoft office .	1
i windows xp which came mcafee . i used both norton mcafee but lately mcafee updates seem giving other users lot trouble . rather than updating anti-virus definitions , etc ., i decided try zone alarm where many users seem like it . i must say moment i installed it only problem i ran you completely unistall your current antivirus , firewall , etc . if zonealarm work . date software worked beautifully . actually , i believe my computer runs smoother slightly faster . i definately would upgrade or buy this product again . check some sellers bargain prices . i bought mine 19.99 , which big savings zonealarm website . it worth every penny	1
why buy upgrade when you buy full version ? basically cause it cheap . you see , old version , new version , 10.4.6 , 10 , 4 , 8 so . i just bought old version installed latest update . now i am up date lot less money which meant i could spend extra cash more software my mac . far performance , no faster than jaguar or panther . benchmarks say faster but if you stare screen any version , 10 nano seconds you save not noticable . you encounter drive issues some point this version appears issues more often . this seems due new journaling scheme but i cannot back this up . if possible i recommend you erase drive you installing . disk utility , select erase tab , then security button , select zero out data option . note : you cannot erase drive but only volume . this clear out any corrupt data pinpoint any bad or damaged sectors . main reason i wanted this widgets . they blessing . calculator , thesarus , package tracking , many more . tiger only comes dozen widgets but widget configuration button , you see more widgets option . you directed hundreds others widgets immediate free installation . my favorite weather radar widget i work outdoors lot . i am able quickly see latest radar plan my week , all press f12 . no need interupt what i am doing mac widgets pop up my layout my activities stay active . click any area other than widget they hide away . if you want wait version osx allows you write your own widgets without taking programming course , wait leopard	1
before buying quickbooks you should google : quickbooks 2007 simple start free starter edition . this free version never times out . you immediately download 400m or get cd no shipping charge . big limit free upgradeable version you only get 20 total customers vendors , so it ideal students those limited needs	1
i used quickbooks basic number years both my church my business . i kept qb 2004 basic since upgrades not immediately necessary me . i chose upgrade this year keep current maintenance , etc . so again i chose most basic product offered - " simple start " . i received it just fine it installed perfectly . however , it not upgrade any previous qb files . i investigated , intuit says it won't upgrade files previous qb versions their web site ( albeit small print ) product box itself , but not ever mentioned amazon listing . so then i upgrade next higher version - additional $80 . qb pro also works very well ; it just shame intuit insists misleading customers not providing full information through all marketing channels . intuit phone rep also tried overcharge me $20 upgrade but quickly accepted correct amount when i pointed out their error second time .	1

i understand software companies strive give new versions their products " new " or " better " appearances but my opinion toos defaults should recognizable version version much possible . i used versions corel since coreldraw ! 3 i just moved x3 10 find trace tool works better but mechanism somewhat cryptic . i would great sympathy buyer using it first time if they never used older version simply because i could only figure it out through past knowledge trial error . results great but methodology lacks some intuitiveness past versions . pallettes far less comprehensive thn version 10 pallettes . i truly wish i version 8 pantone pallette back even though it incomplete it so much better layed out . i never understand why black one end pallette white other , waste time ... tools all there but they appear different . i went work x3 fright away found i could work effectively day one but i resort version 10 ( which i kept my system ) few times first week perform operations i coupdn't figure out x3 which simple 10 . help files circuitous , apparently never actually getting point . line tutorials great absolute novice but useless anyone who actually worked vector art before . export ai still little inaccurate even after all these years . ( you cannot select line terminus expect it there ai ) eps export filter doesn't always want readable adobe either . price excellent , product spectacular its own right i am happy my purchase . i expected little more this version than i got but no less than i additional compatibility . i still need copy illustrator my machine deal people who only program	1
i am average when it comes design , but tutorial helped me creating logo it cheaper better me create one myself than pay someone it . i like tracing feature which allows you remove parts photo place new background . get most out this software you really need familiar lot features already , there lot i am missing . i just take more time keep practicing learning trial error	1

i received this product using it couple weeks . it exactly advertised . it very easy use software extremely user friendly . i am amazed quality recordings . i would definately recommend this product	1
what i like this software it not come too many " gadgets . " my age , i am " technically challenged . " so this software worked out fine me my limited computer skills . i also like fact this software covers castilian spanish . it probably only course available exclusively covers castilian spanish such depth since pimsleur learning like crazy only offer latin american spanish courses . downside this software you not learn much spanish grammar it . if you want learn rules mechanisms required combine words form sentences spanish , you buy good spanish grammar book . i strongly recommend spanish grammar independent learners avigail azoulay , arie vicente . it more expensive than other spanish grammar books but it well worth money .	1

i received my emedia piano keyboard method today it not bad program any means , however i two gripes software : first , either " full screen " option preferences doesn't work or emedia feels 640x480 counts full screen , so if you your monitor set higher resolution ( what mac user doesn't ? ) you'll need lower it order read lessons ' text , since you most likely won't sitting close your laptop/monitor during these lessons , this kind important . second , you need program cd your computer get sound video play , whine my optical drive mildly annoying while trying study/practice . there workarounds bypass this type copyright protection silliness , but it makes me mad i need resort doing this . if emedia so paranoid theft their product , why don't they just stream program media portion their website ? least it wouldn't noisy way . other than these two flaws , program excellent self-starters like me . plus it seems only complete , low-cost piano/keyboard instruction software out there mac osx . i would wrote this review after few weeks lessons instead my first day learning but optical-drive issue really bothered me .	1

i bought this use family photos threw together my first 5 page comic last night . it fairly easy use , but not perfect . instructions thin ( read ' mostly nonexistant ' ) ; so it best you either time your hand or lot experience using complex photo software . good : simple once you get hang it . plenty fixed comic book panel formats chose drag-and-drop photo application makes life very easy . long you ok formats provided , then putting family photos into fun comic book format incredibly easy . i received rave reviews my first ' comic ' finished product exceptional quality . sofware nice assortment boxes , call-outs even some fun clip art . this great buy price . not good : learning curve steep due quirky layout controls . i guess this not too bad issue since there few controls provided software . " dude " who wrote instructions flippant best ( really annoying if you want find basic answer ) definitely not paid produce quality product . downloading photos tough until i found out trick - after , it quite easy . bad : no photo editing software included . simple things like rotating photos 90 degrees prior loading into comic book creator . instructions " comic book wizard " close useless . i mention controls ? they basic ( good bad ) poorly laid out ( bad ) . there no ability truly customize panel layouts ; so this software not help out if you want something really creative . ( diagonals , overlays more . ) all-in-all , this excellent buy software package under $20 . i created great storyboard format some fun memories - bringing great laugh ( few " wows " ) my family , grandparents friends . just aware there learning curve get over before you hit fun stuff . if software more expensive , then i would given it 3 stars	1

i've working punch as/4000 since 10.0 released ( 12 months ago ) . although i agree many respects positive reviews . example , there large feature list . however , there issues software . example : - hard coded limitations software design ( e.g. four possible scale options printing , not support grid snap smaller than 3/8 " or 10mm - which seriously complicates moving things around drawing any degree precision , very tiny dimension text windows , etc . )- inaccuracies : i printed 1:100 scale drawing came out 1:94 approximately ; - i couldn't fit scale house drawing 8.5 11 paper , no print preview ; - there limitations inconsistencies dimensions ( i.e. placement , snap geometry , etc . )- powertools seem series independently developed add modules don't necessarily conform application interface ( e.g. precision , look feel , functionality)- elevation editor very limited . it basically provides visual representation drawing some editing texture applications- can't differentiate exterior wall treatments independently wall surface ( e.g. brick siding same floor ) . - object library very limited plumbing fixtures , furniture , windows , etc . common items aren't library nor they easy find . ( you create them yourself though ) . - 3d object editor ok but not terribly intuitive . - multi-floor buildings get complicated work once you add floors or ceilings . - once you add objects , drawings get big slow very quickly . - import/export limitedin short as/4000 could use overhaul , updated object library , major upgrade scale printing overall clean-up create more integrated functional product . also , incorporate user feedback into future releases	1

i used this software 4 weeks since posting my comment reply review . now chance use software , i only say i am almost 100% satisfied it . some times , it nice spanish dictionary when after few lessons , you still can't quite grasp concept word you're taught , but other than ... yes , it repetitious . those who want learn language , this expected . no , it not magic pill . however , little three weeks i found myself largely able understand what native speakers around me talking , even if my understanding it imperfect . repetition ( they say ) key , but even if it not , dedication absolutely required . you only learn if you stick program , even i rather lax much . still , i am wholly satisfied my purchase . it clear me program only good its user though , i really ought more dedicated following it	1
i don't understand why testing each language exercise not default selection instead select it . it frustrating go through entire exercise hoping see how well you .... realize you forgot select " test " beginning . also , it seems testing should available ' guided exercise ' also ...... not just regular exercises . other than these two things , program very good	1

i started off using turbotax this year , but returned it store use taxcut instead . i purchased this version because it bargain , it easy enough state taxes hand ( or free state website those states option ) . i some difficulty update process , which frustrating first . however , i found taxcut website helpful this point , i determined my firewall problem . i able update product once i followed their instructions . one key difference turbotax taxcut taxcut not integrated many companies . whereas i could automatically download my w-2 most my 1099 forms into turbotax , they needed manually entered taxcut . this wasn't huge issue , but one difference people might want know . i completed e-filed multiple federal returns , which worked great , e-file charge reasonable ( $15.95 ) . however , i don't suggest e-file charge taken out your refund . apparently , there extra charge ( i think $25 ) this service . it more efficient less expensive just pay fee credit card . now software itself . i found it easy navigate enter information . i bit disappointed deduction section . many fields too short me enter complete names addresses charities , which i found frustrating . however , calculations accurate . i checked taxcut calculations regarding amt , they excellent ( turbotax calculations wrong ) . second return i completed , taxpayer eligible eic , taxcut accurately identified this proper calculations here well . overall , i very satisfied product , use it again next year . i make suggestions taxcut , hope they improve their support automatic download forms longer fields charitable deductions . however , even without these changes , product exceptional value	1

this good software casual use ( hiking , biking , geocaching ) , but not without issues . positive side , it definitely beats all non-digital ( scanned usgs maps ) alternatives . level details good enough(how many us need know topography down 5 feet ? ) . fact maps digitally generated ( vectors i believe ) makes all labels clear any scale . it two advantages over its main " digital " competitor , ng topo . first , all us one dvd price separate state/region cds ng . second , it available . i could not even find ng northeast edition anywhere web ! one might think nh me some obscure corners globe not big tourist destinations . now few negatives . exchange feature gps flaky . sometimes it takes several tries unplugging replugging cable restarting program before it recognizes my garmin . part it could low mid range gps still serial connection not truly plug-and-play even com-to-usb adapter ( beats me why garmin can't make all their gps usb this day age ) . any case , regardless whose fault it , it annoying times not able connect two smoothly . second problem i noticed 3-d window . it clearly consumes lot memory crashes my laptop if i lot rapid rescaling . i ended up just closing window , since it pretty much " coolness " not add any real topographical value . finally , i problem delorme service . i purchased it amazon rebate offer . however , month after submitting necessary info i received card delorme stating bar code i sent not upc code . box only one bar code it so i am not sure how i could made mistake . they requested i send correct one , but code cut out gone , how they expect me come up one ?! i feel little bit like cheap way out paying rebate but $20 not worth time arguing them over it . i would interested hear if anyone else experienced same problem .	1

after removing symantec installing zonealarm my computer speeded up factor least 10 . i'm not certain why symantec slows some computers down but leaves others going fast -in my case it insisted scanning every program transferred used scanning every outgoing email even though i truned those features off . i recommend zonealarm users some expertise - during initial usage you need understand what programs allow what block ( look them up google )	1
given this stripped down version some sonic foundry more powerful ( expensive ) professional tools , acid music 3.0 still pleasant surprise . i it set up my computer within ten minutes , very little tutoring instruction guide , able browse music loop library , " paint " out loops multi-track display , modify loop characteristics like reverb bass , so forth . obviously , acid music 3.0 doesn't easily stand alone . this software cannot generate its own unique loops , so i wound up find midi program would let me create original loops making truly original music . but non-musician who hosts radio program bona fide electronic music fan , acid music 3.0 made it super easy assemble my midi tracks into pretty good sounding pieces . i would recommend this program anyone , musician or non-musician , interested breaking into world digital computer music creation . it almost three months since my wife gave me my copy gift , i've managed put together many different kinds pieces music , using both original content great loops come program . it lot fun , me hungering see what more i thing	1

i concur review points up problems adobe new " license manager " method activation . when you pay much you this app , or entire suite , you should not faced complete lockup should you hardware problems , or can't connect internet " location shooting . " i took one star off this egregious marketing tactic . said , this version photoshop superb , otherwise 5-star app . if you take time use tutorials included help ( used separate folders , chapters 1 - 4 classroom book , but no more alas ) , or get one deke mcclelland fine tomes all lessons , there nothing this app novice can't start use day one . today point shoot cameras packing more resolution , more manual control , into their functions , use photoshop becomes more than just hobby . you really " rescue " photos too dark , too bright , exceedingly color-shifted , " cut " folder still make prints . further , camera raw functionality allows anyone sufficiently functional digicam touch up snapshots into fine photography . warning : you need fastest processor you afford ( core duo or quatro superb ) , much ram your system take . there optional performance plug-in which maximizes performance systems more than 1 gigabyte ram . you need least much under windows xp get good performance out ps cs2 . if you use 2gb or more dual-channel memory , that even better ( dual-channel ram adds small boost when handling large file sizes , e.g. camera raw image sources ) . if you don't these , don't expect photoshop act fast . adobe bridge major improvement this version . it offers superior file image management functions , even batch editing images . you even perform camera raw adjustments right bridge . bridge perform batch processes while you edit photoshop . if isn't cool , i don't know what . if you doubt me , check out deke mcclelland photoshop cs2 one-on-one tutorial his chapter using adobe bridge . his video introduction ( included dvd book ) , chapter using customizing bridge , terrific introductions . if you're user versions 5 . ( i ) , 6 , or 7 , upgrading cs2 no-brainer . don't wait . get it now before adobe license manager gets worse 2007	1
i upgraded version 5 . i don't use very many features . but big difference i see , files sizes seem greatly reduced . something i would scan 10mb , now might 2mb . this just opinion , nothing scientific . interface takes some getting used , bit different . overall price ($99 - less $20 rebate ) , great deal	1

great sw , easy learn , good graphics . really helps visualize space when you see it 3d . could improved if numerous similar objects could selected changed simultaneously ( e.g. , windows , doors , cabinets get all same materials , colors , hardware rather than one time - very labor intensive ) . should warn users select/create style then copy/paste them where needed . also , difficult ( maybe impossible , because i haven't figured out how it ) change room's/house overall style once you start given design	1

i downloaded demo this program although i am no means pro photographer i over 4,000 digital photographs my family i am taking new photos each day . addition i post my photos pbase so family friends always see latest photos . i started looking into digital asset management after i started fall behind updates pbase photo website because time consuming process managing my collection . case you not looked , there products out there such idimager , imatch , extensis porfolio , many more . i downloaded demos imatch iview media pro used each only briefly . although imatch costs only $49.00 or so iview costs 3x more ( around $160 ) i chose iview because i felt interface just easier use . course this says nothing features each product i am not attempting feature feature comparison because i don't time . i think imatch excellent product few features i am looking appeared available both products . i recommend anyone looking purchase software attempt download demo first	1

i'm not spider-man fan . i love powers , ultimates , supreme power , planetary other stuff warren ellis , brian michael bendis , et.al . so when i bought this , i wondered if spending whopping $49 would worth it . i wanted read straczynski recent run spider-man , but if i going spend $20 graphic novel , why not spend little more whole thing . that just what you get . addition getting straczynski 4-year run ( which includes spider-man evolution discovery his totemic powers ) , you get everything leading up june 2006 ( which just like 3 issues ago ! ) . all 1 dvd-rom . true , cons when it comes crossovers , you only get amazing spider-man stories reading it off your computer isn't fun reading actual comics -- but doesn't compare getting entire run . it like complaining getting free ps3 , xbox360 nintendo wii , because box didn't come it or you're missing one controller . $50 may seem steep , but if comics cost $3 now , so price like one or two months worth comics -- or 2 books , you get everything . it true , you just print out pages if you want ( so if you want abuse your office or school printer , go it !	1

any e-dictionary give you definitions course , but what i especially like this one it lightning fast . also , when definition contains illustration it indicated icon which you double click view ( which comes up instanteously seperate window ) . this dictionary also allows you search word different criteria other than just its definitions : rhymes , homophones , date , author quoted , definition contains ... etc , etc . one note installation : make sure you temporarily disable active virus software ( it wouldn't hurt same those other programs right side task bar )	1

first , after reading reviews below , i noticed only one person(merrifield winters ) doesn't like this suite . upon noticing he seattle(microsoft hometown ) , i decided look his other reviews . according mr. winters , he purchases extensively uses each version wordperfect office , even after saying each one worthless . he also seems glowing complements microsoft products . this tends make me think mr. winters paid or voluntary basher . my experience cpa , i used both wordperfect ms office day-to-day basis , both word processing spreadsheets , i found wordperfect makes product many innovations then copied year later microsoft office . i guess they save lot this way . also , wp much more intuitive new users . i some clients start ms office , only give up due its complexity lack explanations . i suggested wp them , they found it easy follow . only time i use ms office when i am supervising client their office , while i am complaining it .	1

using turbo tax past 7 or 8 years . when quicken , their wisdom , decided no longer support win98 i thought i'd give taxcut try . worked great simple interview process . i think i'll just stick them now due their thoughtfulness . even when i upgrade doing my taxes upgraded computer	1
i previsouly used accountant my s-corp ( federal , state nyc ) returns well ( federal state ) personal returns . easily come $1000 . turbotax you save bunch around $750 . business product not include state return which $50 , nyc return additional $50 ( available inside program ) . i used it first time this year , i am pretty good numbers , accounting excel . it tool me well over 10 hours enter business returns after all my numbers estimated excel . customer support email helpful community forum , but responses not always quick . it time consuming process research questions . very little guidance filling out state nyc return . tt basically gives you form let you fill areas not generated numbers federal return . tt reviews those returns errors which certainly adds some value ( relative pencil paper ) . it too difficult me fill state nyc myself off fed business return without any software , so i don't see option ( save $100 ) despite limited additional information needed . bottom line - first year using it probably cause some your hair turn grey , subsequent years should much easier . navigation interface not intuitive enough make first year smoot but over years you save substancially preparing you own taxes . one strategy might try it one year run it tax accountant ( training wheels ) then subsequent years it your own . ( course year one would time consuming expensive but probably makes sense long run .	1
i usually dread installing patching turbo tax . this my 8th year using them past it headache get latest updates sometimes . this smooth process . it self updates , downloads patches , applies them tells you when module you using still going updated later date ( gives you expected date too ) . i found this version operate just like all others , but update experience what really impressed me	1
this product met our needs ver well every year we've used it . we used online only version last year , it slow clunky ( we couldn't pick up right where we'd left off ) . but ... desktop version great ! faster than ever compared earlier years , no tax category overlooked personal or business . we ran it mac os 10.4.9 . buy confidence	1
i reading these reviews while wondering whether or not i should upgrade my laptop pc vista . would i upgrade success story , or would i one disgruntled reviewers whose pc now performs like chimp ? there only one way find out . i bought my laptop month before vista released , so i entitled order free upgrade home premium toshiba . i made order one day , faxed my proof purchase day after , my upgrade dvd arrived two weeks later . i am satisfied how fast they sent me package . anyway , back vista . i'd read reviews , took good comments bad ones , used vista upgrade advisor , which told me all my hardware compatible vista i'd remove some software drivers . i everything i told . all i now keep my fingers crossed hope bes t.t he upgrade dvd contained link exe file launched help wizard would guide me through updating my bios removing incompatible drivers before launching vista installation . ( i upgrade , not clean install . ) i didn't anything -- just let wizard uninstall programs reboot computer when necessary . it involved no intervention my part . then came actual installation vista . it quick painless ( one hour ) , no blue screens death or lockups . so far , so good . when vista launched , things little crazy first , os recognizing new hardware toshiba help wizard installing new drivers . things went little awry this point because help wizard stayed stuck driver wouldn't install . it would reboot try install same driver again when it should moved next one . so i exited wizard decided install drivers myself ( i already saved most them cd ) . installing most those drivers hadn't necessary after all , microsoft already installed most those drivers anyway . os felt clunky first , which meant some intervention needed . i removed some applications startup , managed gadgets my sidebar , tweaked it around until vista worked my needs . it now runs smoothly . despite my laptop only 1 gb ram , it purrs like kitten . sometimes os resource hog , but not enough render pc useless . i haven't much opportunity use all it take advantage its features , but this what i like so far : * interface . it actually prettier than mac os ( which i also own ) . aero glass very easy eye . i also like 3-d flip live thumbnails taskbar . i like look alt + tab thumbnails much more than ones windows xp . * search bar star menu . course , we already mac os , but it nice finally it windows well . i'm lazy i don't like look stuff so this tool very useful attractive me . * i like it more multimedia friendly than previous versions , including windows xp media center edition . i am able burn dvds cds create movie montages much more ease . ( though this tool user-friendlier mac . )* i like windows mail . it looks nicer seems more secure than microsoft outlook . * it seems more secure . windows defender comes bundled os now . i hope this os resist malware little better than its predecessor . * names processes running task manager much clearer now . you get names software not just jargon like ehtray . exe , which you don't know what it unless you google it . * network connections much easier handle . my laptop now picks up my home network moment computer boots up . i look connection sign xp , but now i go straight browsing internet vista . there , like all windows oss , cons well : * i detest whole cancel/allow thing . they ask me whether i want access something i've just clicked ! windows gone cautious downright paranoid . cancel/allow feature could useful tool case unwanted application tries access my computer , but prompting me every time i click program , program i've clicked numerous times , just annoying hell . ugh . * i didn't like huge desktop icons . so i right-clicked switched classic view . * i lucky find anti-virus software compatible vista uses flawless real-time protection gratis ( avast ! antivirus ) , but i haven't lucky finding compatible third-party firewall . neither comodo firewall pro nor zonealarm ( free or pro ) , my two favorite firewalls , order , released vista ready product . ( they both claim working it . ) i am stuck using windows firewall now . i refuse use norton or mcafee internet suites . they resource hogs overhyped products . also , i've heard they buggy vista . * this os still comes typical windows nuisances i hate , like leaving folders registry keys after uninstalling program . i hoped they'd found way fix , but no suck luck . i still manually remove program leftovers . i guess macs always far cleaner than pcs regard . * this " innovation " doesn't feel so innovative when you've using most same features years now . mac os all this stuff long time now , so " wow ! " factor doesn't apply me . usual , instead feeling microsoft created something unique , i feel more like they finally caught up everything else out there , not only mac linux , but other companies like google mozilla . all insight i now . i edit review i continue use it . all all , windows vista vast improvement previous installments it lovely eye candy boot . i love ahead technology i'm relieved finally this my laptop . ( even more relieved i didn't pay arm leg it . ) i know i'll repeating this whole process again release leopard my macbook pro . i also ubuntu , kubuntu dreamlinux play around live cds . i love seeing what out there . potential buyers/upgrade hopefuls , all i say if you want upgrade vista , give it whirl . don't let negative reviews scare you -- instead , you should learn their experiences . use some common sense , best your abilities least , make sure use upgrade advisor before you install it . good luck ! :	1

i using mac os 10.3 really long time , it running very slow since 75 percent my hard drive consists itunes stuff . i don't know how it happens but it i decided upgrade version 10.4 it definently worth it . installation process doesn't take too long but it isn't two seconds either once you get it all going , it keeps your mac exactly same it runs quicker speed which great , it added feature things called widgets which great because they very helpful daily life , when you wake up , you click area widgets time comes up weather 6 day forecast my favorite feature flight tracker feature because i lot flying so now i don't log airtran website , i look widget it gives me all flight info , like time or delayed . so i say you get it , or miss out fun	1

i've using graphics apps since they invented i remember well who first invent new features major drawing apps . old days illustrator almost no market share because , well lets just say it no market share . it my humble opinion most difficult program learn use i ever seen . freehand contrast adroit , thus it all market share mac platform instants always united press internationals world standard . release version 7 freehand macromedia announced order reduce apps growing tool set they would now build controls into objects . perhaps this why some neophyte reviewers think coreldraw knockoff freehand but point fact this corels original innovation version one corel draw many many years before freehand copied it . some illustrators newest features like ability add spot colors bitmap version 3 or earlier corel package . draw first program offer true transparent vector objects , gradient transparency vector or raster objects , interactive controls draws vector lens effects simply incomparable . list could go days . corel draw today far most capable app world . it feature set unapproached illustrator . it output any device always flawless my money it lightyears ahead	1

it late night this quick review based my experience vista business . i've only used product week . first , i'm experienced pc user like always keep up date latest hardware . i reluctant upgrade vista first because it didn't support my online postage provider software ( so i thought ) well game i play ( that now supported , but wasn't first ) . one big thing held me back upgrade microsoft sure loves confuse customer . until i ran upgrade advisor i no clue vista home premium upgrade couldn't used upgrade xp pro without clean install . end i go this version . i normally refuse upgrade os without doing clean install first . that very good reason ! one last thing i don't like vista you can't vista clean install upgrade without first installing xp . why this ? so , i opened box put disc after removing several programs startup such my anti-virus program . upgrade went perfectly fine i ran into no problems all . i never once asked driver disc . really . first i surprised how much background hard drive activity there first even when system not doing anything . i fixed disabling some things vista run background . seemed help i don't experience this much anymore . overall , programs seem run just fast they xp . maybe little slower , but i haven't noticed much all . all my old programs ran fine . my online postage software , internet security software even my video capture program . so far i haven't found anything hasn't run properly , but that'll probably change soon . i however one graphical glitch . there weird halo effect around my mouse pointer . it seemed clear up little bit when i installed some new nvidia beta drivers my 7800gt . it still occurs , but rarely . i also some problems windows switcher randomly going non-3d mode . i didn't realize first it not work 3d mode without aero theme enabled . i don't understand why this . truly honest , i'm generally not fan microsoft products . i'll use them that it . i really thought i'd hate vista , but i actually like it .. lot actually . sorry sound like commercial , but i really enjoy using it . i really no clue why it so expensive though ! price way too high . basic edition priced ok , but i don't get why other versions cost so much more . i'm sure i'll come up some bad things say eventually . few things annoying , but i fix them little work . i'm quite annoyed default you can't delete or save root directory : without special permission . no big deal . backup feature nice . i currently my entire drive backed up every morning 8am through windows task scheduler . there no " easy " way this . i some checking online settings add this task scheduler . i also found it strange other got i received error message saying i couldn't edit video external drive without copying it my main drive first ! hopefully i figure out why this occured . something i fix quickly i hope . overall , i like it lot . i definitely wouldn't bother installing it computer that over year old though . i imagine it would pretty slow .	1

this great set cool old marvel comics , which , i think , somewhat associated marvel editor ralph machio . problem i , some covers not original comics . they're marvel masterworks reprints editions . spider-man avengers seem include all original covers ... but ... x-men #s 1 though 7 look like heck ( not don ) . they missing all very nice half-tone blends toned grays apparent all early marvel comics . insides look pretty good . they've photoshopped make borders gutters white - which fine , i guess . but i like look yellowed cheap newsprint ( inside panels ) , because that what old comics made ... if you spend lot time perusing these gems ... i'll bet you almost smell old paper mildew	1

i've used quicken since around 2004-2005 , upgraded each new release . quicken 2007 not without few bugs quirks , but nonetheless served worthy upgrade me , i certainly not dismal experience some reporting . primary change 2007 interface . it just much easier me find run reports this version . i also love cash flow feature integrated calendar , where you set up known income expenses monitor your cash flow . just great tool . i also found it easy set up accounts integrate credit card statements . i not yet set up investments or mortgage but that next step . there few quirks . couple times i've clicked button program just closed . also , i reinstall product one point because automated account setup screen kept popping up every time i started program ( actually underlying reason why i reinstall b/c i bit hasty set up some things incorrectly ; once i figured out what i'd i decided it just easier start scratch ) . but reinstall seem solve problem setup screen . only thing i say i don't like program when you register , control buttons entry not allow you see next line item registry . few times i've looking specific expense it hidden just b/c i so happened entry above it . however this relatively minor issue . short , if you're happy quicken 2006 then you probably don't need spend money upgrade this point . but if you've found some reporting other features little cumbersome figure out , then 2007 solves this problem much cleaner interface	1
gt legends racing simulation based fia gtc tc leagues . what this means you get real world , present day tracks old school autos tear around them . graphics very good sound amazingly good decent sound system . trck selection very good varied . same said car selection . game heavy realism so if you fan arcade racers it may not you . though there career type mode where you run short championships unlock tracks earn money new cars la gran turismo . this system heavily criticized sim enthusiasts but it gives game sense purpose truthfully its lot fun well . if you don't like it you search gt legends forums fix unlocks everything without championships . play this game steering wheel must . although you set it up keyboard or controller neither game justice . any steering wheel but i would recommend one least shifter because it just doesn't feel right using panel shifters these old cars , frankly its alot fun pumping clutch changing gears . if you force feed back wheel then you treat it really adds game . multiplayer component easy use although there doesn't seem alot activity . might somthing time zones if you visit gt legends forums there plenty posts online races . just find good group race i guess . overall i would recommend this game anyone who really likes racing games	1
this pretty good program creating partitions ; little difficult use off bat , but fairly easy learn	1
i gotten tired paying continual price increases symantec so i searched partition maker . finding acronis i tried it liked it . only drawback keeps me giving it 5 instructions bit clunky - not clear all cases . other than , it excellent value	1
it much easier navigate than 2003 ribbon excellent . ohter features speed up process word , excell powerpoint . way go bill gate	1
using these programs years . they make whole process pretty easy . i like owning program so i easily open my electronic tax files future not rely obtaining access previous year programs thru web servers	1
this software isn't actually your excellent version notation software , but what i mean this : there nothing out there you get this cheaply works this well . if you composing orchestra , you need pay few hundred dollars get real thing , because finale songwriter can't notate orchestra , but if you just trying write down some basic music your own enjoyment or if you trying make your band music look more official , this software you . kid , this something i buy my own money easily compared hundreds dollars i would save get real deal , this provides everything i need write band songs or duets friends . it easy use , it not require one study manual hours understand . even friends mine who not know how read music fair amount luck creating what they want it	1
this cd so much useful information , great deal it i not even considered . usually i glean one or two things i get book ( cd ) makes it good useful , this many things i found useful . it format easy follow i could skip over parts i not find useful . some sections more geared military personnel or foreign diplomats , but i guess i could use some strategies if i traveling overseas ? some it also basic common sense , but if there ever emergency , it would good it refer just sure we not forget something . i also think some more useful if we already attacked i would not use many strategies today . i kept waiting part where it would say buy lots guns hide cash gold coins , but there none . overall , there so many things here i not thought , it presented without lot fluff -- just facts -- organized , easy , comprehensice manner . i would highly recommend it entire family	1
we've using this program our business year now . i find it easy use good value money . we used it create invoices our customers , keep track our checkbook , easy access amount our sales each month , quarter year more . i would recommend it small businesses starting out .	1

i used norton years . after all it industry standard , but after it let many virus slip through ; i enough . i knew i would not get mcafee i repaired many computers mcaffee past ( working computer field . ) so i checked all ratings saw trend micro kaspersky best all ratings . i dediced go trend micro since their software edged out kaspersky . well two years later i not looked back . i got trojan recently , but i called free tech support trend micro ( they only antivirus company offers that)- they bailed me out . they very helpful , spent lot time me , etc . after following few quick instructions i back business my computer clean whistle . when i norton , i would email them or charged $40 phone call after their software let virus . talk nerve . no more , trend micro head shoulders above rest	1
it seemed like it took forever install this software . after properly uninstalling my previous software ( norton ) all its registry enteries , i began installation . my initial problem i own 3 computers , running pc-cillin one one them , i problems registering this software .... even though this its own serial number . it rather amusing i purchased multi pack ... registration process makes no allowance those us which own multiple computers . 2 days later i am still waiting fix . rest installation easy ... it tiresome ( i live rural area use dial-up ) . all smooth install except lack error message , when line noise dropped connection ( i not figure this out until after i performed my first scan informed i not most recent version anti-virals ) . decent gui interface , but clunky . i would rather development money goes into software anyway . if you new user it might more confusing ... but quick start guide reasonably set out ... once you figure out order quickstart guide different than order program interface . i am reminded what norton used like before it sold out marketing companies/spyware/greyware providers without telling us consumers . i would recommned this anyone . my only caution read directions before jumping into install . but shouldn't even experienced users ? i just wish quickstart guide checklist same order interface . i am confident because my past experience i get registration problem fixed ... when someone who native english speaker reads my email customer service . dont bother calling phone number , accents staff it just goes call center outside usa ( probably india )	1
good product but when they going fix screen says you not upgraded ! ! ! ! it drives me nutz pop up every time i go quicken online . i written i'm sure others but still it there no way remove it even after " registering " my upgrade . quicken easy learn , easy use , maybe not so easy import export data it very propriatary but still all i love it online portfolio views data glance .	1
before i write my review , i would like note i one semester mandarin chinese , so i am familiar some most basic words phrases . i am using rosetta stone addition my chinese classes so i learn speak better able listen chinese regular basis outside class . i read user guide before -- while -- using rosetta stone . program not 100% user-friendly , so i needed user guide find out how get started program , how put program test mode , how view my test scores , etc . it very easy after you read user guide play around program little while figure everything out . you select " preview " see hear what you learning , " guided exercise " taken through lesson automatically , or go through numbered exercises one one . most exercises , you hear description and/or see photograph , you match up description and/or photo one four answer choices . depending exercise you , you recognize characters , spoken words , or both . there three options reading writing text : pinyin , simplified , traditional characters . these lower right screen . i am using traditional characters my classes , so i always select traditional characters option . there seems lot confusion among reviewers writing section . my cd , there four different types exercises you writing : two exercises allow pinyin only other two allow pinyin , simplified , or traditional characters . traditional simplified characters entered into text box using drag-and-drop method . if you use pinyin writing , you make rather awkward tone mark selections get them over right letter or your answer wrong . although some people would claim pinyin easier than characters , rosetta stone it infinitely easier memorize characters due constant repetition phrases than it remember where tone marks go pinyin . curriculum text so far no use me all , appears pinyin simplified characters only ( which no good someone trying learn traditional characters ) . you don't even really need it proceed lessons , anyway . speaking portion not working out entirely well me , personally . you need usb headset record your voice order compare it native speaker . i speak unnaturally-loud level record anything all , i speak constant force my voice or program stops recording me . i never get my reply match intensity speaker , even microphone directly front my mouth me speaking very loudly into it ( just below shouting level ) . this could my problem , though . although i don't ever match speaker voice , it good practice able hear comparisons my pronunciation speaker . i haven't needed use customer support anything so i can't comment installation easy . i would describe my first semester chinese intensely challenging probably hardest class i ever taken my life . like i said beginning , i am using rosetta stone help me build what i learned already , it great so far respect	1

good news : bitdefender found dormant worm deleted email our pcs norton internet security ( nis ) 2007 missed . also , bd very little impact our systems or applications speed , which why we uninstalled nis - we 8 months left norton 3-pc license but our two older pcs ( 4 5 yrs old ) slowed down due nis so much they practically unusable . hourly bd updates almost unnoticable . bad news : when we installed bd 2nd pc ( 2-pcs 2-yrs license ) , we made mistake using my spouse email passwd instead mine , which we used 1st pc . bad move . it trouble starting , modules erratically turning off . we logged into bitdefender site found same exact license registered two different accounts . we uninstalled it , reinstalled it using my email passwd 2nd key , showed up my account ok . however , there no way delete my spouse account or key their website . her copy still ran funky , but least it started . we used online chat support they friendly asked we download two tools their website provide them sysinfo dumps email . we dumps sent them reply their follow-up email bd trouble ticket # subject . no reply after 3 days . we sent two other queries , one ticket # one without , both explaining we needed her bad account key deleted , there probably some server license issues going hindering operation her pc . again , no response . we wound up uninstalling her 2nd copy my package , buying 2nd 2-pc 2-yrs package . least those packages via amazon $15 cheaper than 1-pc 1-yr cd version directly softwin ( bitdefender ) , so even dual cd purchase it working out only $16 per yr per pc ( nis $35/yr/pc ) . since we installed her 2nd package using different email passwd , alias her name , there doesn't seem any key conflicts causing her bitdefender run whacky . sorry long-winded comments , but we wanted you know if everything goes great , product fast , low-resource impact , finds stuff norton misses . but ( big but ) , if you got problem , you're your own , pal ! tech support zip , nada , zed , zero . thankyouverymuch	1
nero 7 ultra edition extremely comprehensive suite software . unfortunately , most applications contained within more than most people ( including myself ) ever need . perhaps , this suite should broken into three or four different products sold seperately . example , they could easily sell dvd authoring product , cd authoring product , back-up ultility music/mp3 software . pros : when you figure out how work individual components this suite ( see cons ) , they work well seamlessly . i like its ability combine vob files into one file then export it into variety different formats using nero vision . nero recode works well if you burned home movies onto dvd+r dl disc need switch it onto single-layer disc family members who not dl technology . utility burning data cds or dvds ( classic nero burning rom)is quick painless . i don't use other applications much , but you careful nero doesn't make itself default player all types media . cons : website poor instructions difficult follow if you find them . faq section out date doesn't address major questions i when trying figure this software out ( possible it language issue ) . there not even user forums discuss problems software like many other companies offer . software update utility not work me i unable use it months therefore unable fix bug occasionally lead fatal windows xp error . if you update newest version ( instructions follow ) , things work better . i never any compatability problems my drives i seen lot people complain . fixes : if you unable update software usning update utility , following worked me : 1 ) download latest upgrade [ ... ] 2 ) using control panel ( add remove programs ) , remove nero your computer . 3 ) install new upgrade your hard drive . installation program detect your valid software serial number install new version nero 7 ultra . careful nero doesn't make itself default player all media files during installation . 4 ) new update utility works 1000x better than old one there should not any problems . new version nero 7 ultra far superior original version well . course , instruction web site not tell you you uninstall old version before installing new version . it took long time lot frustration figure it out . overall : 1 ) software worked very well me . it worked faster than other applications i tried . 2 ) web site bad , best . documentation bad , best . update utility included this suite non-functional , but upgrade works very well . 3 ) i give this high marks software performance , but subtract simply too many applications included horrible customer support bad web site . 4 ) since i value functionality over customer support , i give this 4 stars ( i would give 3.5 , but not option )	1

i know most people simply not backup their systems . if they only knew how easy it product like norton ghost . this product not only backs up your files , it actually takes snapshot your system . if your hard drive fails completely , you boot off cd clone new drive state it when last backup ( actually called recovery point ) . trust me , it works . i hard drive fail me . great feature you also easily restore individual files specific recovery point . previously used norton ghost 9.0 backup , i already big fan . but , version 10.0 well worth upgrade . improvements include norton ghost manage space used backups , so you don't guess how many recovery points fit your backup drive . biggest improvement all - you mount recovery point mapped drive copy files previous backups , just like it any other mapped drive . i not used backup cr-rw or dvd-rw , although product supports it . i would highly recommend getting extra internal hard drive or external usb hard drive dedicated backup norton ghost . i use this method it works great	1

after trying several game engines , " affordable " class , darkbasicpro only one without high end limitations . reviewer said , it wrapper directx . this means you all capabilities directx , without complexities , including shaders , sound , media , collision detection , packaging , etc . it gives good frame rate ! package matured within last year , many earlier defects corrected . ( manual still leaves room improvement . buy dark basic book also , you happier ! )dark basic pro now requires directx 9.0 . really fast action games , you need reasonably powerful pc . if you find any command limitations , ( even though it over thousand commands ) , you always write your own dll , add capabilities , such octrees engine ( which they don't yet . ) there now several third party add-ons , such " treemagik g2 " other enhancement packs which greatly aid game construction . check out game creators web site , forums ! there other game engines which simpler , " spoon feed " process you . but once you get little experience , you frustrated limitations caused watered down interface . dark basic pro not much more difficult use , tremendously more powerful flexible .	1

any e-dictionary give you definitions course , but what i especially like this one it lightning fast . also , when definition contains illustration it indicated icon which you double click view ( which comes up instanteously seperate window ) . this dictionary also allows you search word different criteria other than just its definitions : rhymes , homophones , date , author quoted , definition contains ... etc , etc . one note installation : make sure you temporarily disable active virus software ( it wouldn't hurt same those other programs right side task bar )	1
