perhaps it my own fault not reading more closely , or failing question somewhat ambiguous product description . fact , i thought i would receiving 84 plastic stays ( 3x28 ) , 28 each 3 different sizes . $8.00 , seemed like reasonable deal plastic collar stays . what i got , i confess product description could interpreted this way , total 28 stays assorted sizes . when you add $4.00 i charged shipping ( actual us postal service postage package $1.84 ) , this really poor deal compared other available options . 43 cents each plastic collar stay ? bad choice	-1
swim suit so unsatisfactory looking i didn't even try it . it blue striped totally different blue strap didn't go main color suit . very poor choice grab bag . taught me not use grab bag shopping this company	-1

quality terrible , undersized or seconds . later i saw same product discount warehouse 1/3 this price . i would not recommend these anyonei paid waiting 6 weeks my credit . amazon must protect buyers better or lots business go elsewhere . it only when problems arist true color marketing company comes surface . i am disgusted this product	-1

2 bras i ordered they same style , it even said so labels attached , however , they both look feel different . white lot more padding , rounder shape , lining tearing away padding ( part design ) . navy bra more pointed shape less padding ( which what i wanted first place ) i also disappointed sparse stock ... addition , i wait extra 2 weeks one bras come because ordering screen i not informed it would backordered . not happy my overall experience	-1
these gift christmas , deep burgundy color . they appear well stitched . however , after no more than 2 hand washings cold water color showed alot fading , 3rd wash i knew they would returned color fading uneven tops adn bottoms almost don't look like match anymore . silk soft lovely but color should not fade this fast or this much !	-1

i am vey unhappy sales professional nautica outlet stores . i very bad experience nautica store outlet stores . customer service representatives very rude unprofessional . they basically said they don't really care if they lose one customer , other customers still buy .

per description , it sounded like these would fit snug . well , they fit too snug , feeling very cramped . i 33 inch waist , ordered 32/34 waist . i'm used boxer briefs made cotton . this first time i've got polyester boxer briefs . unless you like ' um really tight , you might want go next size up , or just get cotton briefs . i'm throwing these away	-1
scarf arrived several holes it . my daughter very dissappointed , crying wondering why santa sent this her . we ordered well advance before christmas but set arrived too late . we never notified there would delay shipping . few days before christmas it arrived ! it too late anything . amazon should improve quality control vendors before it allows them list their site .	-1

i bought this birthday gift my husband , while i wasn't expecting best quality world ( because price ) , i still little disappointed . company wonderful job packaging/shipping product-even buttons individually protected . i paid expedited shipping , but they still cut deadline close , so i nervous it arriving time . lining inside thick bulky so it isn't streamlined pic implies , tends make leather bulge bit places . ( it lumpy-looking even box . ) removing zip-out lining doesn't change this--there significant padding shoulders . it also shinier leather than expected . sizing chart seems bit inaccurate -- i ordered size larger than he normally wears coats ( which size larger than his regular clothing ) , but it still too snug places , lining or not . overall , though , i'd say i got what i paid , if you don't count unusually high shipping charges . ( even standard shipping handling charges unusually high compared other companies .	-1

" sling " misnomer this gimmick ... think " tourniquet " you'll closer reality . there several buttons eyes " sling " adjust fit . i tried every configuration , they all felt too tight . snug fit would more tolerable if thing stayed put , but my experience same other reviewers : noose slipped off after hour or so walking around . despite problems strap , i like briefs . my recommendation buy briefs sans strap . sling technology needs more rd before it ready big time	-1

theory this boot seemed perfect : added some height , came perfectly wearable colors , made real leather , price unbeatable , but ( yes , unfortunately big but)like everything else which seems perfect , it perfectly flawed . i my research , read reviews ordered boot half size bigger than my usual . but still super tight across ankle top my feet , totally crushing my veins . i'm big " shoe collector " i recognize design error when i see one . surprisingly it came this brand , usually so quality-reliable . these boots not meant walking . if you want take pretty picture them , they might fulfill purpose	-1

i agree what others said re-designed sport knit pants . i happily buying tapered-leg cotton sport knit pants least dozen years when lands end decided start making them wide straight leg instead , presumably because some customers requested newer look . maybe i'm wrong , but i think most people who looking latest fashion aren't going suddenly start shopping lands end . it seems me if few customers requesting new style , company should make new , additional product style , rather than re-design product which , according lands end own descriptions , perennial customer favorite . i returned new pants this formerly loyal lands end customer now shopping elsewhere	-1

i worn jockey panties most my adult life witnessed quality slowly deteriorate over time . product went sturdy cotton strong stitching less than paper thin cotton weak stitching . two pair package so thin there already holes them ! i shudder think what shape panties after few washings . given cost panties other similar products , you'd think quality would decent . however , jockey isn't only company out there substandard product . i guess until i afford spend substantially more panties , i'm stuck . i only pay sale prices	-1
i am great shape . however , i cannot get over so many men underwear products waist bands constrict exasperarate blood flow muscle tension . obviously they made china where average waist 25 inches . idea " medium " marketed ridiculous healthy american standards . my body fat low . i am not profoundly muscular bound . common men my age , lower back problems not unusual . i 32 " waist . not " medium " sized ? i think we simply need get rid elastic waist band altogether . one size fits all doesn't work it dangerous those many us fight our lower back problems . draw string fine . it allows flexibility . so what if your pants fall down ? it seems fashion , anyway . just give us option pulling shorts back up instead pinching nerves static elastic waist band causes ridiculous lower back problems because unnecessary , uncontrollable constrictions . also , these boxers don't hold up well any kind washing . they looked like crap after first time i washed them . i wish i could get refund because i won't wear them again . my life partner told me they looked like " old men " underwear . sad embarrassing because i agree they looked like crap after one cold wash light dry . i am not mean hearted kind guy . so , i am going shut my mouth now not business you again .	-1

" i no problem this no show , wearing my lowest-rising jeans it . basically this underwear meant fully appreciated when you not wearing your pants :) me , this trunk not uncomfortable , given its diminished size intent no-show . granted , those moments excitement , things get little more - eh , crowded . but pleasant side effect it look herculean size if you only your underwear . i not experience much more discomfort than i any other brief/boxerbrief/trunk . this pair made 100% cotton , so those you who not appreciate synthetic materials x-factor line may enjoy this feature . my only complaint leg openings not " cling " me stongly waistband since they not made elastic or nylon , etc . but just minor . waistband , always , remarkably soft material mix more discreet height , keeping no-show design . may i suggest you go extra-bold 2(x)ist no show trunk 3133c , which comes contrasting colors - same product , same price , just sexier ! i cannot reccommend this trunk enough , within hours , it became my favorite 2(x)ist product my collection	1

these best windproof liner gloves out there . i freaked out thinking they discontinued them because i thought they made gore windstopper couldn't find any said " made gore windstopper " but actually it polarguard windbloc . any case , when you freak out becuase you think you might not able get something again you realize just how much you like thing . these totally windproof . extremely compact , i don't think you make them any thinner than this . good price . only " downside " they take long time dry out when they get wet . this true any windproof glove so it really not fair call it down side this particular glove . these weigh nothing ( probably ounce each ) so i pack two or three pairs if i know i'll getting them wet . i wear these ice climbing , hiking , mountaineering , i pair i cut finger tips off rock climbing winter , i wear them skiing inside my mittens . these really shine inside mittens because if you anything your hands mitten must come off these completely protect your hands wind during time . i haven't cold hands skiing two seasons now , problem plagued me years . i can't recommend these enough . -scott	1

... not mention great pair sunglasses great price ! initially there problem my order but lu 80s purple very helpful once contact made things settled timely orderly fashion . i very impressed customer service end always important when dealing seller or vendor after initial purchase made . glasses great . though thought some " 80 " " retro " or what you , aviator sunglasses like chuck taylor converse shoes , like cowboy hats , like your favorite solid color t-shirt . its americana , classic , cool , which what makes it buck trend stand test time . i love my new shades . they also come great hard-case so you stow them anywhere not worry them getting damaged . beyond even , why pay over 100 dollars pair " name brand " sunglasses made plastic when you get something sturdier , more durable metal frames ? even beyond , uv rating these actually not any lower than anything else i've ever worn , solidifying fact not only you getting what you pay here , but if your not buying here paying more elsewhere , you most likely wasting your money . i very impressed professionalism kindness showed me customer support . thanks 80s purple	1

these silk pajamas , my opinion , much higher quality stitching , tailoring details , well heavier weight silk than closely priced dreamsacks pajamas . sizing help : help clarify sizing people ( there conflicting reviews here ) , i ordered medium but then returned it . i probably get some minor alterations , but i don't blame company ... everyone shaped differently . i am 6'0 " weigh 175 . my suit measurements 42 " chest , 34 " sleeves , 32 " pants inseam . medium body fit but sleeves pants too short . large best fit overall , although roomier around chest than i would prefer . but if you my size large your best option .	1

i usually search high low this brand , but it always well worth it . these undershirts made extremely soft cotton just slightly thinner than your average undershirt hanes or likes . cotton amazing - these shirts seem last forever , after three washes they feel like they made mold your body . i don't know what different them , but unlike cheaper tee , they come fit you perfectly rather than just hanging flat down your sides like so many other undershirts . if you haven't worn these before , you don't know what you're missing out . comfortable fit means your underarms don't sweat all because material fits you perfectly rather than gaping open under your arms . i really can't describe what difference these shirts make my day-to-day comfor t.t he only complaint i they slightly hard come -- so once you're hooked you'll always want few extras hand . highly recommended	1

i bought two ( got three ) these my parents who going italy spring . its compact i think it very useful long plane rides travel time bus	1
this second pair these sandals i bought am again pleased my purchase . first pair lasted 4.5 years , i hope this pair same ! countours feet comfortable , strap just supportive smooth enough	1
these better than i could hoped ! i wore them first time , 8 hours , first day my vacation hawaii without breaking them . water tromping two miles through jungle left me no blisters or sore places my feet ! very confortable	1
i've wearing these sandals almost 2 months they're terrific . i've never able find pair this style i've able wear comfortably not get blisters or sore spots . these very comfortable . i walk them hours they don't " rub me wrong way " . quality comfort they look good - what more you ask	1
overall very comfortable but little stiff first , got some blisters but now they feel good sneakers very good support .	1
these slippers wonderful - like barefoot but warm cosy . only one complaint - when new they tendency shed , but that obviously not enough keep me re-ordering - i'm " into " my second pair 2 saved next winter	1
my search perfect gym bag like my search perfect hair drying , yoga mat , organizing products , garlic press ( zyliss ) etc . fortunately , my search perfect gym bag officially over . ogio locker bag brilliant inventor should get some sort award . k.r.t. seeley review sums it up pretty well , but here few things add . one thing , shoe area also nicely accommodates hair dryer or curling iron . one reasons this matters it points up critical advantage shelf separating shoe area upper part bag : while shelf sturdy , it also adjustable . it goes only low enough allow pair shoes , but it also raised allow other items . next , while it very nice front end panel all these handy little pockets things like shampoo , brush , whatnot , actually including containers fit pockets shows real consideration their users . plus number outside pockets , several which not only zippered but waterproof well , , say , wet bathing suits . before i bought this bag , i called my gym yes , i really make them go measure width their lockers . magic number 12 " . 8 " , ogio bag fits room spare . raqueteers ( sports , not crime ) , there several loops one end panels holding racquets couple others i haven't quite figured out yet . yogis yoginis , yes , adjustable strap end panel accommodate yoga mat , if it not too thick . outer side pocket nicely accomodates my workout journal ( yes , i'm fanatical record keeper ) , well my beloved newgrips ( just search newgrip ) which indispensable rowing ( notoriously hard hands ) weight-lifting ( billion other things those us carpal tunnel , arthritis , or , my case , both ) . outside pocket perfect cd player headphones . only improvement i imagine this bag would adjustable straps bottom hold larger , rolled towels or mats . unfortunately , even title9 doesn't seem carry one anymore . other words , this bag best market . it bit pricey but it worth absolutely every cent . i suspect quite lot my friends getting ogio christmas birthdays whatnot . congrats , ogio , thank you very , very much	1

i bought these slides house slippers based other reviews i read . i give one caution , you may not like them first few weeks . first few times i wore them , my feet really sore after hour or two . i recommend wearing them socks week or so until all nobbies soften become more flexible . after this break-period , you'll able wear them any way you like you'll love how they feel after long day wearing shoes	1
these replacing same thing so i knew what i getting . pool side they greatest sandals or maybe even just lounging around . adidas makes pretty good stuff .	1
i almost didn't order these ear muffs based some other reviews , but i'm really glad i . if you're looking simple ear muff , these it they great deal only 5.69 . one other reviewers commented they poor quality too thin . they thin because they made thinsulate ! if you want something bulky , i guess you should order product not made thinsulate .	1
luv them , but order 1 size smaller - they run big - i wear true w-6 but they too big . size w-5 fit great . you might go kids crocs . they should tell you item description so you order correctly . besides , i would give them 5 . i no idea why they sized so wrong . if you order your true size you return them one full size smaller proper fit	1

adidas three types shoes their " ride " shock absorption running shoes ; gigaride , megaride , this - microride . microride outsole consists smaller sized absorption grooves ( aka nike shox lookalike ) . gigarides megarides emphasize shock absorption . microride more concerned weight , it seems like . there also two models microride , one full fabric top , synthetic leather construction . this one full fabric , which supposed soft , also lighter . ( synthetic leather supposed more durable . ) anyway , combination microride full mesh top , this shoe low very light . i can't find number anywhere , but once started running , shoes feel like featherweight . impact little bit harder , due less shock absorption , so it probably more treadmill shoe than trails . overall , though , very comfortable . it my first time running shoes this light i like it . these , i achieved my fastest pace ever less effort than i would expected . couple things i notice : size narrow/small side ( compared my nikes ) , back heel support bit hard/tall my liking . white version gets dirty quickly . running good , but walking wet road experienced slight slippage . also , workmanship leaves bit desired	1
this perfect little summer shoe !! great ked quality fashionable design !	1
i love these undershirts . they better than onesies especially newborns . onesies slip over baby head whereas these shirts don't . much easier dress newborn . i also liked " built-in " mittens so baby can't accidentally scratch herself . i told my sister these she bought some her newborn son . she loves these shirts , too . ... you can't go wrong white	1

i'm 13 i i love wear these boxer-briefs because they so comfortable . i've into puberty 2 years now . they tend ride up legs bit when sitting down . they aren't thick fruit loom boxer-briefs , which better because they don't get hot . after they washed you wear them , they pretty tight first 10 minutes , but after they just so loose legs . you start loose some support your looking . i would suggest get size smaller than what you really . i'm waist size 29 i should wearing xl but they too loose so i wear . try it out see if you like them . they awsome camp outs swimming anything than gets you moving . great support	1
i bought this wallet it really nice , exactly it looks picture . i totally recommend it	1

gold toe makes best socks i've ever worn , i've buying them long i remember . normally i would get cotton crew socks but decided give these try . these medium heavy cotton sock fits well probably last forever . they may seem bit loose first , but one washing pull them back into shape keep them up . furthermore , they little thicker than normal socks , but not thick wool rag . so , consider how your shoes fit before getting these . if they snug , these sock just make them snugger . finally , i like color selection these socks . oh , yeah . believe it or not , gold toe fantastic customer service department . i sent them some digital photos some socks i can't find anymore they matched them up . , amazon prices worth 5 stars right there	1

i'm 16 years old normally i wear boxers , nothing else . recently i purchased 8 pack these briefs excercising because i thought i ought give briefs try after 6 years . first , it bit strange , but i quickly came enjoy feel this style underwear . they don't bunch up or give you " wedgies " like boxers because their looseness center-seam design . they provide support your male stuff stay place throughout day . people tend believe briefs " too tight , " hence term tighty whiteys . if they're too tight , you bought them too small . simple . these briefs perfect wearing any time any situation . i thought i might feel self conscious while wearing them , but comfort them overshadows any . if anything , i'm proud . overall , i recommend you give these briefs shot , no matter what underwear you tend prefer . however , despite pre-shrunk they shrink up bit after initial wash . i'm 32 boxers , but 34 these works out great	1
i am very pleased this shirt . material workmanship great it feels good wearing it . what else you say shirt	1

given low price i expecting pair gloves would survive maybe one winter . however they seem very sturdy , thick leather ( so it take some wearing break them make them softer ) they go well business apparel . i like back zipper look but i've some people turn their nose up it ( guess it good thing they offer them without zipper )	1

my hubby loves these boxers , they something he wanted childhood . only slight downside them i recommend you either hand wash them or delicate setting your washer	1
though i prefer flannel cotton boxers , i needed silk boxers long hiking camping trip . ( silk great moisture-wicking quick-drying properties . ) under nylon shorts , intimo silks managed keep my special fun area reasonably dry even while hiking driving rain . when they get wet , they dried much , much faster than cotton boxers . they lasted couple months before falling apart - pretty good show durability , actually , given amount punishment they took . i only two pair i alternated them , often full week washings . obviously they got kinda crusty , but couldn't helped . under circumstances they held up well . i would recommend them . this boxer/brief/thong controversy , i believe man should wear whatever type underwear he finds most comfortable . if means boxers , fine . if it means thong , fine . what women consider stylish should very bottom man list concerns . women consider all kinds ridiculous things stylish , such hairless pets , square-toed shoes , pointy-toed shoes , monochromatic look music andrea bocelli	1
i just got this dress it adorable . you wear it dress or shirt jeans or leggins . it easy dress up or down . great buy money . extremely flattering comfortable	1
other reviews note , these pants incredibly soft , comfortable , very flattering fit . i absolutely love them . they fantastic wearing during yoga , pilates , cardio machines , low impact or toning activities . however , please aware more vigorous rapid your movements , pants may not hold up inside seams ( i wore them during high impact class lots very deep lunges kicks , inner thigh seams seemed like some stitching little frayed end class ) . so save these wonderful pants low impact activities enjoy truly great product make you feel great wearing them	1

bravado maternity/nursing bra very comfortable daytime wear , so i would highly recommend it if what you looking . way which bra opens closes makes it very easy comfortable , it doesn't create strange lines under your clothes like some nursing bras . after first few weeks wearing this bra , i no doubt i made right purchase . downside , others mentioned their reviews , i notice time went bra seemed somewhat less supportive . same lines , this bra bothered me wear bed , because my breasts always seem fall out it . i know i wearing correct size , so maybe this due low-cut criss cross shape bra . whatever reason , i found it quite irritating uncomfortable wrestle my breasts middle night !! fair , i same problem another(different brand)nursing bra also , so maybe this just what happens when you try sleep bras . consequently , i ended up buying sports type bra sleeping . overall , because i only used this bra daytime wear i resigned myself fact i'd wear breast pads almost any nursing bra , i really liked bravado bra would definitely recommend it .	1
i've jumped rope 7+ years cardio just purchased my 4th pair these . i cheap plastic one weighted rope ( this everlast leather weighted ) . plastic one costs only few dollars i use if i'm traveling more than couple days , sometimes mix it up . weighted rope good cardio workout which also tones your upper arm extremely well . this my 4th pair because others eventually cracked through , which happens when it drops repeatedly against floor bad angle . one them also just wore out center where there alot friction floor . i tried plastic handled brand , but cracked around same area well , even sooner . this classic , fully recommend . it didn't receive 5 stars only because it needs replaced every couple years . but then again so all others . highly recommended	1

hi y'all! when my wife became pregnant , she worried she would constantly expand her wardrobe our wonderful growing child expanded her belly ( yeah , i know babies grow uteruses , but " belly " just sounds so much cozier ) . these baby mine maternity belly bands allowed her wear her normal pants skirts waists undone all way up her sixth month . after our child born , my wife no more use bands , but i didn't want see them go waste . i always pretty trim , but i wondered if baby mine maternity belly bands might work growing beer belly well growing baby belly , so i began eat drink excessively , allowing my belly grow . my wife thought i idiotic , but i told her she her turn , so she should let me mine . after gaining fifteen pounds noticeable paunch , waists my pants no longer buttoned comfortably . i undid my pants , wrapped my belly one baby mine maternity belly bands , threw old oxford shirt . after buttoning just top few buttons oxford , i looked if i wearing particularly snug , extra-long , patterned t-shirt underneath . i went my local watering hole none guys recognized i wearing article my wife clothing ! i now become big fan baby mine maternity belly bands , bought additional bands add my wife collection . well , i suppose i should say " my " collection since i'm one wearing them . if my wife becomes pregnant again , i , course , share bands her . who would thought my wife pregnancy my frugality would result sharing clothing me my beloved ? i joke her my " child " due any day now , then rub my belly lovingly . my wife gives me strange look , sighs , then just shakes her head . i know she just jealous , so i tell her , " hey , all you become pregnant again if you want wear these baby mine maternity belly bands . " " i don't know if your fathering child such good idea , " she replies . i ask her what she means , but she just shakes her head says , " never mind .	1

this truly delightful scarf . it very soft buttery , lightweight , long . drape incredible . you wear it just around your neck or drape it over your head first it looks stunning . initially , i got winter lilac color , which actually magenta . very pretty color . i loved it so much , i bought ivory , black , cassis ( dark burgundy ) . this good thing , because my six-year-old daughter cabbaged onto first one . imagine : scarf child actually * wants * wear . i love this scarf so much , i'm going buy other colors i don't yet . we very cold , windy winter this year , i wore one these scarves every day . they kept me warm without oppressively heavy . they also roll up into almost no space all , so they're ideal travel or your bag " just case . " scarf 100% acrylic , one drawback it dry-clean only . i suspect handwashing would okay , though . even if you baby it bit , it worth it exquisite texture . i highly recommend this scarf .	1
even it inexpensive , item amazon arrives extra package protect it bended . i appreciate consideration	1

i bought this scarf my daughter away college . she wears it daily cold . everyone she meets admires it . those who " know " really love it wish they their own harry scarf . those who not know harry lore still admire striped colors . she best dressed college senior campus . scarf very high quality embroidered seal . it last years years . well worth money .	1

i bad experience these shoes . size runs very small . every pair shoes i own size eleven , i've ordered other size eleven amazon confidence . this pair , however , i could hardly squeeze my feet into . trying walk so painful i immediately pried my feet shoes . i returned shoes , i disappointd two things : 1 ) i pay shipping ( almost $10 ) send shoes back . 2 ) my shoes cost me $30 ( not including shipping them me ) , but company only willing refund $20 . so , reality , it huge waste money . i paid $45-50 shoes , including shipping both ways , they only refunded me $20 . so i lost $25-30 these shoes . what waste . i give them zero stars	-1
these sweatpants awesome ... i purchased many variety colors .. hard find just right pair sweats but i think i finally found them ...	1

i many kayano models last 5 or 6 years latest kayano xii superb shoe . good forefoot ankle protection , light ... performance shoe . other runners i often experienced shin pain . i never any such problems this shoe or its predecessors . you buy other brands , i , but you also likely return asics reliability consistency . if you've best why change	1
i like carry my cash my pocket when possible . purse pain . so this very nice few bills lots coins . it bit bear open until you understand how . you open sides rather than squeeze . so it doesn't actually work way it designed --- least not well . but that small issue this nice , well made product should last long time . it easy pocket --- no bulge . it handy	1
i love pattern , very disco . material little stiff , but it looks good head scarf	1
shirt cool terms temperature hot day stellar terms looks . striped , turn-up sleeves , which you adjust such nice touch . purple shade more like blush , but looks beautiful anyone who likes pink-purple shades . it 100% cotton , strong oxford cloth feels " garment washed .

hanky panky 4811 best . hands down . this * only * underwear worth buying	1
pretty case , but lanyard doesn't actually work it . not impressed	-1
how much u talk g-strings ?! lol . i guess title pretty much says it all . they very comfortable , my lady likes look , they priced right	1
those adjectives my son used when i asked him describe these slippers . i bought my husband men version christmas , but he not able wear them because my son wouldn't take them off . i could not find any fit my son , so i bought him small size women he loves them . he puts them soon he comes home , sleeps them , only takes them off put his shoes school morning . we highly recommend these slippers !	1
these slippers just what i needed- something keep my cold feet warm cozy . my only criticism toe pointy , so i get used my toes little squished . definately buy 1 size up . i'm size 8 9 fits well	1
these nicely made warm slippers , but if you want order them , aware they smaller than other shoes same size number . my wife wears size 9 shoes . i originally bought these size 10 , thinking they should fit loosely , but even those too tight . i return them , get size 11	1
perfect newborn winter . these rompers well constructed , inexpensive , not too thick prevent layering under other clothes should need arise . orange yellow ones especially cheerful . i should note legs became too short my son long before rest romper ceased fit , so if you long-legged baby perhaps try size up	1
first time i used this one almost fast i recieved it try it , it felt weird first i thought i wasn't going able use it underwear , it best all thongs i have(not many ) . i wore it college it felt wonderfull , almost like going commando , but same time offering some protection , if i didn't roommate i would wear nothing but these when i am appartment . strongly recommended	1
i've always wanted something red sexy . these underwear exactly what i looking . i slightly hesitant buy silk underwear first , but this thong quite comfortable . thin sides pouch design allow plenty movement . some may find cut front somewhat low , but i like it	1
how you not like these . comfortable , durable great bargain	1
enjoyed isotoner slippers many years , i sorely disappointed when they changed their sizing/fit several years ago . package sizing remained same , however , they decided " scrimp " fabric . consequently , newly purchased slippers , though well within my known size range , ( supposedly through 10 1/2 ) still ran short toe ( i wear 10 ) , thus far less comfortable . i sure ... you bet . i still ancient pair when i slip , excellent fit . no stores carried sizes beyond xl ... until i saw these amazon . i ordered them xxl they really fit . re-ordered 2 more pair each my daughters ( who've same problem ) . i give 4 stars i've found their overall quality not quite what it used ... but least they fit	1
i've wearing these slippers years they've become increasingly hard find stores so i'm grateful amazon finding them me	1
just note say this t-shirt some good things going it . it size it says it . medium really medium not really large . printing held up well wash fabric isn't chintzy so there no see-through going . i would reccommend this shirt	1
i ordered dress it came very quickly . it here less than week . it looked exactly like picture came all accessories it suppose . i'm mine altered because it inch too big up top . dress easy alter . it also very easy either attach spagetti straps or use scarf make straps attach dress . if you're uncomfortable strapless dress . there so many different things you this dress it great . it great dress great price	1
like all 2(x)ist underwear i own , this brief made superior materials appears built last . it certainly well worth price i paid . if you like wearing extreme low-rise jeans or simply not want flash your waistband any reason , then this brief you . period . those men who wear standard low-rise jeans or like , then you not need this , but you still very well may want it . clearly this brief meant two things ( 1 ) make it so you wear very low-rise pants ( 2 ) make it so you look irresistable when you not wearing your low-rise pants . i found even though underwear cotton - opposed synthetics x-factor line , example , this brief still conforms my body contours pretty well . actually very well everywhere except it bunches little where it meets very inside my thigh . regardless , this going show off everything you got , subsequently make it look ( more-or-less ) more impressive . practical consideration : pouch area above reduced size since it accomodating very low-rise . translation : cautious when you get aroused there not great deal " expansion room " . enough said , but why i gave this pair 4/5 stars . everything else great . i never problem my rear exposed these briefs . if you forsee this problem you , then may i suggest 2(x)ist contrast countour pouch brief 3103c ? it same price ( review time ) same materials but standard cut features sexy contrast lines . i own it well you may read my review it its product page	1

although levi 505 jean usually referred zipper version classic button fly 501 , levi 512 model seems closer me . if you looking 501 fit without hassle buttons , this may way go . 505 rather full seat crotch ( technically " rise " ) look pretty baggy . though described " slim fit " , 512 more moderate fit , snug but not formfitting , much like handsome 501 . rather than slim fit , it really should described 512 " tapered leg " , because it pretty strong taper ankle , which means it not fit over boots , unlike 505 501 . only real downside this jean comes only one finish , rather milquetoast medium stonewash . over time , however , it breaks pretty nicely looks good .	1
but i expected lot less price . all pockets clips everything really cool , it even two way zipper . while im wearing this thing , i feel like i am ready defend freedom . excellent shipping speed	1

review : charger sync adapter brick can't fully engage player because leather straps , so it easily disengaged slightest movement . slightest movement ? i dont think so . no adapter doesn't fit jack well when it this case but it fit . if your going buy car charger your zen i would suggest you buy one you don't need adapter it , plus it charges faster , just like wall charger . i only use adapter home . headphone jack lines up fine . review : fold-over flap isn't designed well . first all , it gets way headphone jack , so many times when i opened flap , it pulled my headphones out headphone jack . part headphones beyond me . you put headphones jack two ways . you completely close case , foldover flap then put headphones , like when youre not going changing songs alot . i this when i am working out gym . second way headphones inserted case but fold over flap/screen protector , open . i this my car so if i want change song while driving buttons right there . i never headphones pull out jack ive it over three months i wear it everyday ymca . then theres .... finally , this real deal breaker , fact you cannot plug adapter bottom player when case . you pull player out every time you want sync or charge you player , which big hassle . this also not true . i didnt think it would fit right either when i got this mail . but it fit . you just can't button case closed . i use adapter or my wall charger(which same size port my zen , thank god ) while this case my zen . then ... case small player . when i tryed put player case it tight fit , when i finally got it case bottom buttons player pushed down case . this case also adds lot bulk player well very uncomfortable use . don't listen anybody who thinks this product great , they lying . case seem tight but thats how you should want it . you don't want your zen shaking around case you ? this case not press buttons down . it take some getting used because you press harder get buttons . but scroll pad right there open so you don't worry . i this case since i bought my zen . i bought it ebay 10 bucks . yes it seem add some bulk zen but i like it . ive dropped it twice all ready while this case there no damage . it actually seems some shock absorbtion due its studriness/thickness . people whining beltclip .... only time i put zen case my pocket gym . i put it my pocket clip outside my shorts . i am upside down when i decline bench press upside down when i situps , it never fallen out or even seemed like it going slide out my pocket . if you care your zen like i this probably best case get it . best ive seen anyway . dont go them cheap rubber/plastic covers(you know which ones i am talking ) . also inside cover/flap there " secret " slot where you put money or id even . its sweet yes ? high five ! people seem knit-picking this thing alot reviews i've read . buy this case , learn how use it before you get here roast it all right ? ive it long i my zen it great no matter what you doing .	1
i love it ! it exactly what i mind . there silicone skin complete cover plastic shell front . shell covers display there cut out click wheel covered silicone skin . system comes three silicone skins ( " clear " , black , glow dark)and one shell . there option belt clip ( i don't use)that works well too . bottom open both connections . hold button top little tough get if your finger nails very short however . there adapter well ipod dock . me this perfect case	1
this comes 3 silicone sleeves one transparent hard cover ( used either sleeve ) . keeps ipod protected while maintaining it slim profile . click wheel works well even under through silicone . package also comes special iskin dock adapter so you dock/charge your ipod without remove case - extremely convenient . only con i've found so far it difficult move hold button silicone sleeve ... but it fairly minor my opinion	1
these boots sized very oddly . my guess they 1 1.5 sizes smaller than they say . my size 7.5 mom got these gorgeous size 9 boots she loving them , so not bad purchase over all	1

my poor son got deprived backpacks bookbags because homeschooled , but now he college student , he carry books ! this means 5 star rating might biased sheer pleasure simply something feel like fitting crowd , but fair honest this product ... i admit it look like quality item . it built practical , looks good , ( guess ) i'd say it probably better suited college use rather than high school . some odd reason college doesn't require many books carried one day i see what high school students carry . if this bag dual set each bag opposite sides , it would seem resemble old-fashioned saddle bags ( except it not leather , maybe little bit larger capacity , plenty individual compartments zippers ) .	1

edited add ( 2/13/07 ): i washed my jacket first time it still looks perfect ! i think it shrank just tiny bit , which only made it fit better ! ------------------------------------------------------------------------- if i give this jacket 100 stars i would ! i yet wear it ( arrived today , tried it ) i love it ! it perfect weight texas winter would transition well into spring ... my only regret ( like everyone else who reviewed it ) i not buy one each color ! i monitor amazon prices almost every 2 hours so hopefully i'll able buy couple more when prices drop ! jacket definitely great quality -- nicely lined not smell or stink , sign high-quality tanning process . ( i'm wearing non-washable suede jacket cost 4 times more it reeks tannins . ugh . ) caveat , though : i not go amazon sizing chart . i searched all over web live little/ami size charts nordstrom it . go chart instead amazon perfect fit ! those who hesitated last time , when this baby drops price again , go it ! well worth money , well worth time well worth monitoring amazon hourly	1

i looking this kind tie tack very long time becasue it great . i helps you keep your tie down while still able see whole tie	1
i say this works perfectly serves its purpose better than stupid-looking tie bar ( unless you're security guard or used-car salesman or something , i don't think you want tie bar showing ) . one caveat if you don't line up tie perfectly tiedown , it bunch up bit , but i don't think there really any way they could've designed around . you just adjust length little make it work if happens	1
very tight sexy but comfortable great wear . love it , like it red	1
i found pajama set very nice quality received them short order . thank	1
this very good quality funtional mask . i use this under full face helmet cold weather motorcycle riding . priced right . velcro adjustable . long enough cover neck area	1
levi usually my choice brand jeans pants . so when levi introduced this new fit , slim straight , i purchased pair tried it out . 514 very large range sizes trendy washes , usually sale very reasonable price $30 . i recommend this fit thin men , tall or short , who i think look best . men who aren't comfortable wearing tight jeans shouldn't purchase this fit , because it certainly figure revealing . it slimmer around thigh , unlike skinny 511 jeans , where it much tighter around both calf thigh . waist low rise , which i find very comfortable while wearing , leg opening straight cut . 514 shrinks slightly when washed dried . i personally think this fit better looking than skinny 511 , which i believe just fad now . skinny sort tapered-mom-jean look it , i don't think anyone agree guy looks good ! i suggest you try these jeans out before buying them , see how you like them . me , i like them so much , i think i'll purchasing pair future	1
tired sad , slightly smelly mats gym , i set out find yoga mat would inspire me put time ... even when i busy ! success ! just normal thickness , but cushier mats tend make me feel slightly unsupported . grooves provide good solid grip your feet , though it little slick first , after i washed it used it while it became nice sticky . but above all , reason you probably considering this mat rather than cheap(er ) one ... beautiful pattern . i selected blue one , i've gotten so many compliments . more importantly , it makes me enjoy my workout even more . ah , kicker - pattern isn't just surface ( other reviewer pointed out ) , but continues through entire mat , so you can't wear it away use . certainly recommended	1
besides service or quality product , service provider it great , due some reason first attempt sending it fails , so provider send me e-mail confirm if i received item , soon i let him know i didn't , he not wait anything he sent one immediately , so i appreciate his gesture professionalism . thank you	1

i small microfiber ameribag , i highly recommend it . carrying this bag not going eliminate your back problems , or make it feel like you carrying nothing all your back . but , small bag great because it forces you downsize basic items you need carry ( instead bringing backpack full things ) . beauty bag design you place it variety positions your back/shoulder , based where you feeling back pain . pockets inside very thoughtfully-designed ; there seem just right pockets everything . i carry this work each day instead purse . i also use it day trips --- it easily holds wallet , digital camera , phone , travel umbrella , even small sweater	1

this 3rd travel clothesline me ; not because previous ones broke but because i keep finding clothelines offer better features . this best one so far since it eliminates need clothespins , better holding wet , heavy clothes clothes don't slide . my only complaint i wish it suction cups clips ends like my other travel clotheslines so i could hang it bath/shower or attach it poles . my previous clotheslines those features i used them alot . work around this i use small carabiner each end . this travel clothesline would perfect if it offered all those features .	1

i am so happy i got these bands ! when i first noticed my clothes weren't fitting anymore ( around 11 weeks ) , i went maternity clothes shopping completely discouraged lack clothes early pregnancy . when i got my bella bands , i automatically felt better myself ! so far , they four fabulous functions life-saver : 1 . make shorter , non-maternity shirts appear longer so you wear them longer2 . allow you wear non-maternity pants button undone - even jeans ! 3 . hold bands maternity pants up so you wear those earlier . 4 . keep everything tucked supported so you feel more confident less flabby . so far , i'm wearing them tucked over once , but i'm sure later my pregnancy i expand them full size they'll added comfort peace mind . every newly pregnant woman needs get these month 3 !!	1
i am so happy my bella band bundle purchase , so happy i bought pack 3 . i hesitant spend money these but after searching net this similar products figured i'd give it try . buy these early ladies ! i waited until my 24th week buy bands today slipped pair pants i haven't worn 2 months , unbuttoned unzipped even , but nobody could tell bella band . look cute layered not bunchy . nice material even felt great under my shirt no more belly button ' hole ' showing!i'm going up my ' skinny clothes ' box pull out items i wear my bella band . i'm so excited use this now post-pregnancy . ps - they even came nice surprise bag skittles , heaven me	1
this shirt one kind . it only dark navy shirt large chicago bears logo it i could find . it little large me , but looked great first time i wore it . however , after just one wash , some logo started peeling off ! i can't imagine what this shirt look like after next season , probably just navy long sleeve shirt ... buy this shirt caution	-1

these really good boots . i am definitely glad , however , i read reviews before i bought them ordered half size bigger , or they would extremely tight . they actually even bit tight even bigger size , but they stretched quite comfortable . only thing annoys me bit they tighter calf than any other boots i purchased . i solve only zipping them up 3/4 way . otherwise , i am happy them . i didn't think i would like rounded toe much square , but gotten use it like it	1

pros : great cushioning / support ! simple design , not too flashy . very breathable , allowing plenty air circulation around your foot . cons : not really comfortable . they seem really wrap around your foot , which fine if you go out run ; but walking / everyday life , you can't really let your feet ' rest ' . i minor chafing ( back foot ) after first run them	1

my 2 1/2 year old son almost heartattack when ups man finally brought these door . he so excited he could barely breathe . when he opened box put them immediately he not take them off . he loves how they light up . velcro elastic makes them super easy take off . i would recommend buying size larger than what you think your child would wear because i think they run little small .	1

hanes makes excellent white traditional brief gentlemen amongst us who just don't want wear boxers . relatively snug fit ensures these briefs not " bunch up " like loose fitting boxers so often ; many men prefer these briefs reason alone . briefs easy care ; they essentially permanent press so any washer dryer set clean them well . they seem last forever , too , which makes them excellent value . if you , try get these without tag rear so you won't get itch caused tag . however , even tag you usually don't feel any discomfort . i've worn ' em way years without problem . 100% cotton fibers these briefs add comfort you'll feel , too . my only real caution -- main reason this product gets four stars instead five -- these briefs tight first several times you wear them . this may true some us men even if hanes claim these briefs preshrunk before they hit store shelves . i personally would suggest washing them once or twice just loosen fit up ever so slightly . relatively minor concern elasticity waistband eventually wear out . point you need buy new briefs -- but , then again , nothing lasts forever , right ? overall , gentlemen who want close fitting brief still gives them comfort very satisfied these white men briefs . three pack gives you value they last long time .	1

this case ( barely ) hold my 5.1 mp sony cybershot digital camera large zippered pouch . small zippered pouch nicely configured holding extras like batteries , extra memory sticks , etc , padded pouch webbed rear wall velcro secure webbing -- giving two practical accessory sections . belt loop well made , strong , well secured , doesn't velcro or snaps ( which i hate , since i fear losing camera way ) , so this thing stay your belt , worry free . zippers appear strong , don't bind or act sticky . it feels light fits comfortably my side or back via my belt . it reasonably attractive such bags go , especailly low price . display cardboard it came mounted ( i bought mine discount store ) said it lifetime warranty , it looks like it made long life mind ) . padding appears sufficient all around resist normal bumps , etc . ( though i would fear drop concrete ) . i actually bought this hold my tiny memory stick based mp3 player , related accessories ( i already similar bag my camera ) . when my creative muvo player el-cheapo case came player cracked badly i feared it breaking completely , i wanted cheap , durable , reasonably sized case . i really wasn't able find anything made such player . then i looked small camera bags , figuring if i could pop earbuds winder couple extra batteries , i set . now this what i carry my mp3 player . it easy carry 1 5 extra aaa batteries player earbuds winder . player stays dry , padded , secure . very versatile zipper ( two zippered tabs leave any zipper hole where you want , big or small you want ) large pouch makes it perfect let earbud cord peek out without fear any rain getting . i think if you small digital camera or small mp3 player , care more functionality , durability , very reasonable price than latest fashion fad -- you can't go wrong here . only three ( small ) drawbacks tiny mp3 player use i see : 1 ) . i used piece bubble wrap pad player large pouch . it actually bit big small pouch , would flop around lot big pouch . 2 ) . course , you can't get player controls when it secured this case . this doesn't bother me i generally just turn it , adjust volume circumstances , pick music i want , close pouch , enjoy my music . if however , you want fiddle player controls lot , you won't like this solution . 3 ) . instead custom-made hole headphone/earbud cord , you need use zipper gap described above . i see no practical harm , fact it makes where " virtual hole " goes extremely versatile . however , it may fashion " disaster " ( which i couldn't care less , personally ) .	1

gold toe makes excellent sock their " men canterbury dress sock " no exception . socks remarkably comfortable . they not thick ; although they bit thinner than other gold toe socks they still withstand lots wear . they almost never " bunch up " inside my shoes i walk around they very much worth price . they last longer so long life these socks justifies slightly higher price . i also like design toe section actually gold colored fabric . amazon points out these socks come your choice four different colors : black , navy blue , grey marl brown . safest , most conservative choice corporate office black color ; but other colors come handy too depending your work/play " dress code . " these socks easily washed any washer or dryer -- but i would heed manufacturer warning not drying them high temperature . high temperatures clothes dryer cause sock wear out faster . stretch nylon stretch even more ; then these socks become just too loose your feet . please note these crew length socks . they not come up your leg degree some other socks . you may consider them " too short . " other hand , socks also fit shoe sizes 7 through 12 so it almost one size fits all . overall , gold toe brand buy if you want good quality , long lasting socks . " canterbury dress socks " men match any attire they even worn bed those really cold nights keep your feet warm ! highly recommended ! may you wear them good health ! smile	1

i this bag little over year , i love it . ok , some stuff you need know ...... this bag charge your cellphone , ipod , pda , camera , aa aaa batteries ( ipod batteries require purchase seperate adaptors . you find them [ ... ]) i think it takes 6-8 hours charge nothing using sun , but you confirm above website . it also adaptor charge battery home or car . this backpack not charge your laptop . space provided solar collection isn't big enough . there seperate solar arrays you purchase fold up go backpack ( i've seen them $200 ) . upside backpack you don't stationary it collecting power , unlike folding arrays . i wear mine while walking around chicago , or cycling work school . bag isn't much heavier than " non-solar " bag . infact , once i put all my school books it , i couldn't tell difference weight this one my old bag . even cold chicago winter , i get charge relatively clear day . ( i.e. it doesn't hot outside , just sunny . ) also , aware this bag battery stores power you collect until you're ready use it , some other manufactures no battery , which means you sun when you want charge something . i didn't purchase my bag through amazon , ( though i must say i'm thrilled they carrying it now . ) i dealt directly voltaic systems , their customer service point . i hope this review helpful you	1
i purchased these tights store(for like [ ... ] bucks ) . i like them , they thick but not not hot or itchy . great part they not roll down top you cant see like my little girl underwear comming out side leotard tights . my little girl 3 years old , she not really tall but she inch taller than all other children . so i got small ( worker store told me it would fit ) , sizes run like this : toddler 2t-4t 34 " -40 " small 4-6 40 " -46 " intermediate 6x-7 46 " -51 " medium 8-10 51 " -55 " large 12-14 55 " -60 " over all it good , only reason why i not vote it 5 star because i only used them once but next week we using them again . so if you looking ballet tights buy online because price good !!! unless you got different source	1
this kavu bag fabulous . it great diaper bag , go bag , purse , going hike or picnic . any mother or woman go , i would recommend this bag	1
overall these shoes fit fairly well , stylish appearance , price right . only concern i they seem run little short length ( odd nb ) . i buying nb shoes long i remember , this first time my toes obviously very end toe box . they look good though , provide great arch support new balance famous . it always good idea try shoes before you buy them , but online price so seductive , it difficult pass up " deal " . if possible , try find some your local shoe store before you purchase these , pictures don't show you all angles this shoe , parts trim ( my opinion ) " goofy " looking . overall , i'd recommend these shoes walking/jogging/going gym . if you want some serious running shoes , spring higher-end asics , nb , saucony , etc .	1

i am 48f i tried many sports bras my day . this best one market large breasts . no bounce . it feel little restrictive first , but once you used bra it great . best sports involve running , walking , or any kind bounce . not very good sports require intricate upper body movements like yoga	1
this bra great , especially larger woman . when i use this bra i don't move or bounce all . before i use two bras ( even when using one champions best ) . i purchased one ( because they pricey ) , but soon after purchased because i didn't want use anything else . this well worth money .	1
ok , so oprah recommended this bra - you might heard . ( particularly if you visit enell website . ) but there very good reason . sports bra , this bra completely perfect - it eye hooks all way up front , while you may feel bit first like you're wearing chest girdle , i honestly say i've never enjoyed high-impact activities ( running , aerobics ) much i now - precisely because it so uncomfortable past . bra feel tight first , particularly around ribs - but trust me , if you get right size yourself , you follow their instructions putting it , you'll amazed what you comfortably	1
i walked every rockport made these more cushion than any others .... 10 star " s+++++++you love these !!!	1
my feet hurting so badly my old shoes i would quit jazzercise . now i never miss never want take these shoes off ! they so comfortable support my feet so wonderfully ! i actually received them , wore them twice got back ordered three more pairs ! one my mom one my sister one more me because i never want without pair	1
i got this bag black , it exactly what i looking mesh tote . however , i give it 4 stars because although price only $13.98 , shipping $10.98 !!! i purchased it anyway because bag priced lower than anywhere else i shopped , which made final cost acceptable . granted , i receive it one business day ; however , i believe shipping cost excessive item weighing 1 pound shipped within same state .	1
there " possible " defect m1122 model . i wanted post my experience here case others this same problem . after wearing m1122 shoe only few months , my pair started producing very strong odor . smell not inside but outer backside , specifically area consisting encap material which , according new balance , polyurethane plastic . smell gradually got worse , so bad fact , i keep them my garage smell like mildew/urine odor . i don't own pets , nor i gotten anything sprayed it . smell didn't suddenly occur either , it gradually became more intense over few weeks . washing shoes washer wouldn't get smell out so i returned them new balance store late december 2006 , they replaced it new pair . up until this past week ( late march 2007 ) , new pair great , but now they started putting off very same odor , again , not inside shoe , but coming areas shoe encap material featured . i decided call new balance directly informed them problem . they told me they fact other complaints people all commenting odd odor coming m1122 model shoe . nb requested pair sent them testing . if you experienced this problem your m1122 ( or other models ) , contact new balance customer support via their website . ** regards comfort i give this shoe five star , but regards problem above , i would give it zero star . common ground , i it two stars but based problem i experienced now two pairs exact same shoe	-1

i'm content this purchase though would liked little more support than bra gives . however , price right over all product	1
pros - these shoes stylish fit wellcons - little heav	1
i love this jacket . it fits really nice shoulders , but bottom looks like maternity jacket . i wear 16/18 i got xxx-large , i wish i would gotten xx-large . its big side but it gives me lot room wear my wool sweaters .	1
this good bra , price . it comfortable , well-made , provides good support	1
i prefer front closure bras without lot padding this fits my needs perfectly	1
i just bought two more action shape bras , i compelled write how much i love them ... little over 10 years ago , my sister turned me them . genetically , we're predisposed big bustlines , which its advantages disadvantages - one latter trying find bras fit support still look good . i've tried many , many other sports bras ( trying find one $20 range works ) none other compare - racerback types don't give me enough support - other ' high compression ' bras create oh-so-unattractive ' uniboob ' look ; underwire sports bras very short life - they're pain keep washed it doesn't take long underwire pop out underarm area ( ouch - always seemed happen during heavy workout ! ) , et cetera . champion action shape takes care all . there enough separation where this looks fine even wearing under shirt ( i've even able wear this bra under blouse or sweater if i'm planning going horseback riding after work ) . straps fasteners totally adjustable . bra mostly cotton , there might some lycra or polyester there but i'm cotton freak - no itchiness , no seams chafe , best all no underwire ! it totally supportive - i mentioned , i ride horseback ( this trumps popular rider " no bounce bra " sells over $50 ton hooks - like corset - ugh ) , am also gym rat , doing high-impact aerobics , weight training , spinning , pilates yoga - this bra eminently suitable all those activities . care easy - just toss it washer dryer or air dry ( i generally airdry hooks tendency get caught ' holes ' dryer ) . they look good . i just wear this top its own . btw champion come out new color this year - champion red . i just got it it looks awesome ! highly recommended	1
fit this bra flattering , clips easy enough fasten unfasten . however , inner cup slightly cuts into your skin , which lead itchiness after wearing it all day . i am still trying out nursing bras , so this i don't many compare this . however , it best fit i found so far nursing bra , especially if you well endowed	1
these tank tops very good quality . they soft very minimum shrinking , if all . they not fit very tight but they not baggy either like many others where you might buy size smaller . very comfortable wear . i plan purchase some more	1
this stuff good when you go you just want listen your music w/out hold it or anything . i would choose this over anything .	1
this product arrived time works terrific . couldn't find silicone case anywhere town -- only one place car charger it $30 itself . this whole package great deal . case really protects gigabeat	1
this clutch looks so expensive so many different slots money , credit cards , change . i originally bought it go dress but returned dress kept clutch . it looks like real alligator skin though i love fact its faux . everyone tells me how nice it . i don't know why person reviewed it poor quality it fell apart because it so durable i've it month it still looks brand new !!! hopefully you make purchase . enjoy !!	1
i am addicted my pair kobo iii women plan buying multiple pairs next summer . perfect beach or pool or gardening or running errands , these shoes one-piece construction plenty drainage wet conditions . they light pack easily , come very reasonable price . best all , these shoes wide . i wide feet , big wide ugly feet , but i rarely buy wide because heel such shoes too loose me . end result ? i'm limited boxy styles pricey european makers ( ecco , dansko , etc ) i buy medium width -- generally one one-and-a-half sizes bigger than my foot measures . kobo iii , i could fit my actual size . i haven't since i teenager . i wish i'd known these shoes when i pregnant my feet got even wider ! my only complaint they obviously casual sport shoe -- no real way dress them up make them go everything .	1
go it . your goggles may fog up , though . if so , use medical tape just top part your skin prevent air escaping upper part up your goggles . i tried them very cold still ok . if it gets too warm , you bring nose part lower your chin . perfect use wit hemet . good price too	1
we bought both this brand soffe artiga compare . we like artiga more far somewhat silkier look feel , but they run tad small you may want order size larger than you usually wear . soffe also excellent quality , but more vein true cotton t-shirt runs true size	1
not only they make me look frumpy , stretchy belly portion these pants start 3 inches higher than pubic bone , which makes them pull very tight when sitting down , especially later months pregnancy . they fit fine 5 or 6 months , but 9 months denim too tight lower abdomen section . i end up taking them off something more comfortable immediately when i get home .	-1
my perspective , it perfect gift little girl wants just like mommy . your daughter won't mess your purse anymore - she'll busy her own . bought it 2 my nieces they both love it	1
i running top line new balance over 15 years . i'm overweight pronated . 50+ year-old runner , i'm more interested running tomorrow than if i got personal best today . new balance minimizes my injuries better than other four top shoes i've tried four other brands	1
forewarned ! never mind all mellifluous flubdrub nature-formed last , footwear classic , nineteen sixty-five , etc . facts matter ( ) irish factory where wallabees handmade love closed down late 1990s ; ( ) product made mainland china since time ; ( ) materials workmanship don't begin come close their former standards , which duly reflected downward price shift ($180 1998 but $110 2006 , inflation notwithstanding ); yet ( ) web sites -- which claim shoe " even better " -- seem no problem posting photos no-longer-available irish craftsewns while shipping chinese hack jobs . very , very disappointing , gentlemen . ( i once found fellow ottawa who bought up considerable quantities sand suede wallabees selling them premium -- $225 -- i happy pay , but even he ultimately went out business , just like peter , my custom birkenstock sandalmaker germany . ) i once phoned vendor complain , some imbecile tried explain me product " better than ever . " i flew into rage , telling her what she could her lies . i also chastised her brass-bound gall lie me , diehard wallabee fan who continuously owned ( worn , day day out ) several pairs -- sand suede , oakwood suede , brown leather , and/or black leather -- since age fifteen , two-thirds lifetime ago ! ( oakwood [= dark brown ] suede always my favorites , since sand suede always looked little too smart-alecky me , making me look [ quite accurately ! ] like upper-middle-class new york city jewish boy -- just mate them sergio valente jeans , creamy velour shirt , ultra-expensive sweater . ) all vented , wallabee still reasonably comfortable shoe -- assuming you find two members pair actually match within reasonable margin deviation ! teenage kids won't know difference , but baby-boomers moved tears . get program buy either pair those ultra-advanced , computer-designed , ruggedized flip-flops ( there scores vendors ) or some quality suede sneakers ( leather ones far too oppressive educated foot ) . caveat emptor !	-1

before carhartt goes way l.l. bean , fox racing inc ., timberland ( barney new york matter ) stock up great , genuinely tough , useful , comfortable , attractive clothing like these shorts -- everything else carhartt makes . these clothes make you feel look good ( " comfort clothes " you might say ) while you're rolling around dirt or even your living room floor . i laude previous reviewer honesty saying they're great wearing without underwear hot weather , because they really , really . jeans / denim most cotton cloth get hot , real uncomfortable particularly man ' bait tackle;' whereas this cloth breathes exceptionally well . they're particularly great after doing endurance sports taking shower -- when you're body still all reved up -- loose , comfortable cool-down clothing you're fine wearing rest day . pockets loops also very handy , not only working car , bike , or doing construction , but also plenty big enough carry your cell phone ( even my treo ) , keys , wallet comfortably without like those huge , ugly military-style thigh pockets . i expect carhartt might someday start marketing itself just like other great , functional brands went hip-hop style or suburb/country sheik , if they it real loss . but now least we enjoy long series brands became famous function before it popularized suburban teenager fashion then ruined .	1
i wearing these around house 2 days test comfort fit . they very comfortable cute too ! they bit stiff out box but i able bend stoop better than i would thought when i first put them . they also surprisingly lightweight warm winter boots . they true my size 9 womens foot . only negative i come up shaft big laces don't help tightening them up . i small legs though i not tuck my pants into them either . if you bigger calves or want tuck your jeans or snowpants you'll fine . my jeans fit over top just fine . i would wear long sock keep them rubbing my legs	1

if you new new balance 99x line then you wont notice these shoes stiffer than 991 . 991 cadillac running shoes , your could wear them all day suffer very little fatigue . 992 stiffer sole overall quality shoe seems like it last longer . 991 some cheaper plastic parts liked crack fall off . 991 pros ; comfortable , better running shoe , cheaper992 pros ; not quite comfortable but still better than most , last longer , looks more stylishfor those you trying choose these brand , remember these shoes made usa not sweat shop workers country . they both hold up very well over long run compared other brands .	1
i looking long time several features this micro-fleece offers . first all inner sleeves nylon lining makes it easy slip off without static bunching up your shirt sleeves most others result . density fleece top notch , not weak thin stuff you see way often . it usual required adjustable draw cords . i think more people would attracted it if picture displayed solid colors ( black ) i think two tone combinations look cheesy . --- try it!you'll like it !	1

i ditched bulky jewel cases my cds long time ago favor nice binders would hold disk artwork securely without taking up too much space . since my collection continues grow much faster than i anticipated , i recently started looking buy more binders . alas , ones i already ( no boundaries , wal-mart all places ) don't seem available anymore , so pretty exhaustive search online options brought me this item . basically , this binder pretty much everything i looking : three ring construction , sturdy zipper closure keep discs safe contained , sewn-in handle back so it portable . plus this particular model rings slightly oversized stated capacity , so there possibiity expanding buying more sheets . i bought three , they work great . i buy more - several more , because they best option there present . let me tell you , however , what i don't like them . first , cover some sort plastic or vinyl . i see this cracking or disintigrating couple years , even gentle treatment . second , there isn't proper spine binder : it basically single , flexible sheet wraps around outside but doesn't make square corners . means it look untidy shelf also makes me question its long-term durability . third , sleeves : they too tight put disc artwork same slot , ones closest rings their corners notched accomodate rings , slits oriented zipper side instead top . those drawbacks aside , i plan buy more these . they best choice available now , but i wouldn't hesitate ditch them if something better became available . if you looking safe , flexible , smart place store lot cds , this item should top your list .	1

what great jacket this ( i've got it stone ): simple , casually elegant ( i guess also depends who wears it ... ) , seems stain-resistant ( i received many visits dirty , muddy tiny shoes nothing shows ! ) , absolutely water-resistant ( i clumsily sprayed myself water while handling garden hose nothing went through , it dried up quite quickly ) . sure , i could used extra-pocket inside , but hey , 40 bucks ..	1

case arrived looking good it pictures . i thought it looked stylish/retro . i read other reviews there scratches caused mainly space above click wheel below screen . i checked stitching before placing my 30gb video ipod . stitchings around border soft . but when i felt stitchings around click wheel hole i see why there alot complaints ipod scratching around there . sitchings bit more rough aound click wheel than it around screen . but other reviews i read , there no scratches long term use case . but i nothing worry because i kept plastic adhesive sheet came ipod . so i suggest those who want cautious , try buying adhesive protective sheet if you dont it or you could just wrap your ipod saran wrap . after just taking my ipod out it left some sticky residue back , ugh , took me forever rub it off edges but it still left some residue . sides base there lining glue ... figures . but its still good case . guess you just fully cover your ipod front back before putting it	1
i bought this my 30 gb generation 5 ipod , after doing tons comparison i love it . those who worried showing off design ipod this not you , but people who deathly afraid dropping ipod or scratching it , this it . clickwheel very accessible ports . it won't fit dock , but if you don't dock it stay when connected your computer just wire . i also love look it . it looks like wallet . one note , if you interested hanging this belt loop back strap , it functional but bit awkward . snap velcro safe enough keep it , but it always seems wrong position fiddle . i am very happy this purchase	1

i paid expedited shipping , but my order took forever ! communication company unacceptable say least . first i received only half my shipping refund complain amazon bestpricecenter get res t.t here no way i would ever business this company again , i would like urge others likewise . this not personal , just bad business practice	-1
i ordered these shoes size 7 because i pair sodas 7 ( they fit ) . these shoes way too small , i'd say least half size too small . careful order right size ... apart , they super cute great shade red	-1
shoes fit good . i ordered 1/2 size larger he needs break them . nice looking shoes i would recommend them anyone . he wore them 3 times he says they feel better .	1
bra really comfortable easy use . material soft breathable it looks good under clothing . only problem shoulder straps extremely short cause some ride up . i am not long through shoulder area so any normal length strap would more than sufficient me . this would 5-stars if they would lengthen those straps . i medela bra different style it same problem	1
i never one wear something other than baseball hat longest time . finally i started branching out looking different clothing styles . something said " me " but didn't put me into any specific category . i found hats bailey wool-felt hat . its comfortable because its material , you don't baby it like some hats . if something smashes it down , it easily reformed back its original shape . hats style alone not say cowboy or retired yuppie , but more practicality it represents adventurer or even just " average joe " class . its working mans hat wear town , or city mans hat wear while relaxing stream after day fly fishing . make sure check sizing chart if you ordering online ( i use my baseball caps , which sizing mark inside tag , reference ) otherwise it might best try one store make sure it fits . i like way they various sizes encompass different exact measurements , way no matter what , you'll find size you looking . i only say this because baseball caps i've trouble finding cap i like pro back ( non adjustable ) size i need . i found drawstring nice addition but not something i really needed there never high winds whenever i'm wearing mine . nice change pace statement simple style , bailey wool-felt hat affordable , durable , classic	1
shoes comfortable , but not walking long distances . they true size	1
i am so pleased this product . my son loves them i can't brag enough lightening fast shipment .	1
i not receive correct item i sent item back return . picture shows what i wanted but got something else . so i say i disappointed . i received some kind chamisole instead .	-1

... would look fine either by-tor or snow dog ... highly recommended !!	1
these shoes very comfy . this my first order placed amazon i amazed how quickly i received my order they exactly what i thought they would .	1
this great pair underwear . it very soft against your skin . it doesn't feel like most thongs ride up you or give you major wedgie . they comfortable enough worn all day . there enough waist these it won't obvious you wearing thong if your pants droop . enjoy minimal back coverage provided while maintaining comfort this underwear it holds you nicely place	1
reviewer below hit it head . if you want your boys ride comfort all day long , want not even notice your underwear all day long ... believe me thong lot less annoying than either boxer briefs or especially briefs . , yeah , wife likes me em too , but real bonus all-day comfort . guys ... you'd better try these things . try all kinds , but this one near top my list . lots room no binding . go slowly ... buy one thong time make sure it fits before buying moe same kind ! some fight tight ... others loose	1
these shoes sweet . i also recommend garnet b-ball shoes .	1
new style t-macs . these best . they very comfartable . i bought them day they came out . if you into black then buy them now . because i know they coming out white blue so they same pattern last year . so if you like black buy now if you like white wait till mid december . otherwise this show very comfy better than last year	1
ordered my boots december 15th last year . still haven't received them yet . one star boots looking so good amazon web . minus 4 stars not my feet	-1
i bought these warmth . while they feel good , my feet still little cool when it gets below 30 degrees . also , after first gentle hand wash , they got little " nappy "	1
this shoe works it supposed . i use it because instead going barefoot when i go long distances , jog , or if i'm not sure there aren't sharp stones , shells , or chards glass sand or pavements close beach . only problem fabric/material picks up stains easily not come off	1
these shoes very comfortable . i wear them all day without pain . they rubbery soles don't make noise when you walk hard surfaces	1
i several pairs vf panties they all among my favourites . material lace band panties not quite so silky or sheer lace nouveau which my all time favourite , but they probably prove more durable . time tell . i like little lace my panties it adds interest classic look . this lace waist band though rather narrow tends roll over become invisible . i owned panties wider lace band quite liked effect . rear seem nice it tends define my rear cleavage . sum up . good value panties but they usually get passed over when i'm dressing special event . i might wear them beach see what others think	1
actually first time , i didn't know clothes quality . but now i say " this awesome . ~ " don't hesitate , just buy it	1
tried purchase this shoe eastbay website but without success . able succeed getting same shoe eastbay through amazon . thank god amazon , company knows ecommerce !!	1

these socks awesome . i love how soft cozy they . yes , they ' shed ' bit , first time you wear them , you'll get little fuzzballs under your toes , but i remedied this washing them inside out first , then outside (?!) problem solved . these wear extremely well . one year after buying wearing these socks , they still great condition soft day one . gave them gifts this christmas rave reviews . i highly recommend these fabulous socks	1
fast shipping , product neatly packed advertised . would buy again . recommended	1
these shoes very pretty they didn't hurt my feet all after wearing them 6 hours holiday dance . i purchased them black they'll versatile enough wear formal or everyday occasions . they well made i feel i got them bargain price , especially $20 discount offer . i am debating buying pair different color .	1
i love this bra except underwire uncomfortable end day	1
perfect . what you say perfect ? seams sewn well , elastic stitched properly , fabric very comfy against skin . nothing bites you anywhere . fabric seems thicker crotch area needed . color doesn't fade washing . they shrink when washed first time , but this allowed sizing . order your correct size they seem bit loose before they washed , after they fit exactly size chart . i'm getting 6 pair i like them so much , i wish jockey matching sleep bra	1
bra very comfy . it thin so nursing pads seen certain clothing . but over all great great price	1
i absolutely love this bra ! it so comfortable , you hardly feel you wearing bra all , yet you supported all right areas . it just enough stretch it those days when you little fuller than others . it super soft feels great against skin . this bra also very durable . i wasn't sure if i going continue nursing when i firsy my baby . this only bra i , wore it every day . you imagine , it washed almost every day well . i this 3 months , bra still excellent condition ! i finally bought more these bras !	1

we purchased this ( size small ) hat our soon 4 year old daughter . fit perfect small child even allows room grow since it elastic band inside . i see her still wearing this age 6 or 7 even . material stiff but it " straw " cowgirl hat . my husband cowboy hat same way also straw hat . if you want soft material your best bet crushable fleece one . [ ... ] we thrilled it matches her boots saddle perfect .	1
i love these rain boots . my daughter i enjoy " puddle stomping " these keep her feet truly dry . handles help her pull them thoughtful touch , they sufficiently girly encourage her wear them . i'll purchasing next size up when she outgrows these	1
i am 6'1 " female ordered size 12 . actual shoe part fit fine , however , i could fit both legs into one boot . sizing utterly ridiculous . you also charged 20% restocking fees any returned merchandise . don't waste your time .	-1
i these shoes .... also black , pink , white . i found them really comfortable ... i narrow foot they fit me fine . they tend little stiff when you first get them , but once you break them you can't live without them .	1

during my pregnancy , i rushed out bought two these bras after them recommended several people . all i say i don't understand what all fuss . it basically very tight sports bra snaps . my daughter now three months old i find i wear bravados only when my $12 motherhood maternity sleep bras dirty . i love motherhood bras ( though i wear sleep bra all day long ) . they much softer , easier get off cups just pull down instead snapping . even bravado , i just pull cup down instead snapping it because it so cumbersome re-snap . i won't buying anymore bravados . i'll stick motherhood bras or cheap regular sports bra now	-1
i surprised quality this jacket . i always thought windbreakers flimsy , but this one built pretty well	1

this comfortable shirt . i also like style it . excellent either when going golf range or golf course .	1
pretty much two things make people recognize me ... my headbands hoodies . both which adidas always match . white/black adidas sweatshirt = white/black head-band . red/white sweatshirt = red/white head-band , orange/white hoodie , orange/white head-band , etc . etc . etc . first it out practicality ... exercising , etc . but head-band , well , story behind i too cheap buy new set head-phones djing , speaker left side broke off , leaving it lose . great djing , but remnant plastic rather uncomfortable right behind your ear . so ... i headband one day i got keep using my old rag-tag headphones i loved so much ( i've since stopped so cheap got new set ) . why adidas hoodies - they're just so incredibly soft comfortable ! i like them more than nike ones , then i think they're just bit more stylish . this though great sweatshirt . very warm , very soft , pretty cool clors . i cream/red colored one wear it loads - even though there isn't matching head-band it yet . drawstring good , pocket big ... what more you ask ? bit expensive , which shame because you know it $20 tj maxx next winter . but still , i like mine .	1

i like use aqua shoes houseslippers , but they ususally black rubber soles leave ugly marks floors . i took chance ordering cudas hydrosox hoping reasonable quality fit non-marring no-slip soles . that what i got . these pretty sturdy , they fit better than any several other brands i've . they're extremely comfortable , they look good . soles durable -- almost-clear latex composition , very nonslip , totally non-marring . these sturdy enough use when driving . i wear them short errrands -- coffeeshop , supermarket , etc . i say 4-stars ( not 5 only because nothing perfect ! ) , whereas i'd rate all other brands i've tried no better than 3-stars	1
my husband wears these his work boots kitchen , we add some insoles more comfort but they holding up well he really likes	1

i seldom get pulled brand names initally balked cost this bra . i've since bought several more . thankfully , this one , there zero chafing me . that not case others . cross-over straps padded which perfect long runs . everything holds place there no squishing or bouncing going . fabric wicks beautifully . if i redesign this bra i would bring hook closure front instead back .	1

this sleek easy-to-install little pouch works great . i'll admit , i originally tried placing sensor under my shoelaces . unless you like interrupting your run every five minutes go searching your missing sensor , shoe pouch definitely way go . best part it versatile - i move it my asics running shoes my keen trail running shoes matter seconds . distance accuracy spot . service delivery times grantwood excellent ; i got pouch matter days . if you're not fan nike shoes want inexpensive but well-designed solution , i would highly recommend this product	1

it nice looking hat it fits me very well . said " flexible straw material " little deceiving . tag hat says " 100% paper " . it very light ( which probably good thing summer ) material very soft . it certainly not tipical stiff straw hat , fact there no stiffness material all . like i said ,, it looks good fits good , but i'm really glad i bought it sale	1

these my first pair gauchos , i'm always leery buying new fashion or brand over internet ( what if they're poorly made , or don't fit me right ... returning hassle ) , but i've got say , i am delighted this buy . i'm 5'4 , they hit just right point my calves , although if i much shorter , i might think they too long . i athletic build , but large hips , i worried these might make me look huge , but they very flattering my body type ( i also friend who pair quite slim - size 2- they work beautifully her too ) . they ultra comfy just right amount stretch . because they mostly polyester , they aren't really breathable , but they so lightweight , it not factor me . they also virtually wrinkle-proof . if you're looking buy gauchos , or just comfy pair hip pants hit town , i would definately recommend these	1
i bought short crew version b/c i reach my $25 max free shipping . i fell love socks bought more including this one which just soft comfy cushioned feeling	1
purse size true dimensions listed , but lining not quality i expected . explanation " water-resistant " nylon opposed silk lining it made it more practical backpack , however , this bag obviously not designed backpack . leather high quality you wouldn't want exposing it elements any significant length time , much less trying put anything larger than paperback interior . i really like versitality various pockets pouches , including interior wallet , magnetic snaps hold everything together pretty well . it remarkably light , even all my stuff it . color appearance shown here true actual product . i like fact wallet top zippered partition , so you easy access your cards , cash , etc , without dig around . all pockets zippers snaps extra security . we'll see how it holds up over time !	1
these briefs just pleasure wear . they look feel good , fabric smooth comfortable , design superb low fit full sexy back . narrow fit legs comfortable pouch cleverly lift up shape your bulge - looks cool under jeans , i also like red waistband showing over low rise jeans . ck should make thong version . your best briefs yet ck	1

good quality bracelet no flaws . arrived promptly . little pricey but one kind	1
i initially clicked infamous " live wrong " bracelet because i thought it something my 26 year old son would think funny fun wear . i've probably only read three reviews all time i've shopping amazon . i don't remember why i started read these reviews but once i i hooked . i am 52 years old , fat but not stupid moron . i've lost 4 people i love cancer . i am cancer surviver . i think these bracelets exactly what they supposed , funny . i believe they personal statement , every other colored band sold . what i think wierd uproar this caused both sides . truly offensive people those who feel they judge person any bracelet , hat or car . while i drive my suv i wear no bracelets any color . i taken advice d.l. hereford . ray " conspiracy theory " send my chairitable contributions direct . i contribute time well money what i believe time slipping bracelet off doesn't count . i daughter-in-law who relay walks other fund raising activities while she wears her yellow bracelet . i think she considers bracelet less important than rest . i think silent bob would approve . brent freakin ' wilson , your anger over this way overboard . i sense other personal issues . see your pastor . emperor ice cream needs write book , maybe he could call it , i'm smart , see . or perhaps geraldo type talk-show would work better . then he could allow people view his impressive intelligence first hand . lovestory 27 , quite reading romances grow up . way , there t-shirts money going charitible causes , too . why allow evil doers put live wrong shirt ? doesn't anyone realize this amazon.com not political forum ? all bands , black , yellow , pink or aquamarine more club membership cards than anything else , don't make them more important than they . i'm buying some !!! i joined this damn thing , i am officially over edge .	1

i first attracted these shoes because their cheerful color . secondly , i attracted general style these shoes , which when worn long pants gives appearance pump without flying my foot like pumps . crowning feature this pair its five inch heel . therefore , style color , i would give this shoe five stars . unfortunately , i disappointed way shoe balanced . it required lot more concentration walk than most five inch heels . this due its very thin stiletto heel . also , it rather painful . albeit , most five inch heels very painful . therefore , i would not recommend wearing these shoes extended periods time , nor slick surfaces . luckily , clasp top shoes not dig into my leg , i expected it would . overall , i would give these shoes three star rating far comfort concerned . i ordered items this seller numerous times very pleased them . they ship quickly their items always good quality . i highly recommend them . - ravenov	1

i bought pair black . they fit perfectly soooo comfy . bottom shoe zigzag so it flexes easily like you're not wearing shoes . i gave it four stars cuz i cut off tassel since it looks like worms hanging off your shoe ( which real easy ) bottom shoe not completely covered rubber , part it suede so you can't wear it near water . otherwise very comfy cute	1
i've wearing this shoe several months now , my only complaint it very wide shoe . so wide , you'd think it unisex sizing . problem footbed itself . even though you cinch upper shoe secure your foot , you can't cinch it up so your foot can't slide sideways inside it . otherwise , it easy on/off , secure tread -- never slipped dock yet . it would fine women w/wide feet who would ordinarily buy men athletic shoe . also seems very durable	1
i just got these sneaks recently . i am going through wear-in phase shoes . so these opinions based soley , no pun intended , my time them so far . originally i gotten pair jordan hoops low . i loved style got good deal them . well , i found out 13 jordan more like 11 or 12 other shoes . so i them returned 14 . i got 14 they long enough .. just not wide enough . it then i found out most jordan b-ball shoes pretty thin width . i told guy i am willing look what they store just get something i try . i ended up trying kg a3 they felt nice . i tried these t-mac 6s next they feel better than kgs overall . kgs felt better heel , but only place . everywhere else , t-macs more comfortable it perfect width . just shoe ... they hurting my feet just bit .. but common me break period . i am overweight flat footed so it takes while me get my shoes comfortable . they also warm inside . i am just wearing normal cotton socks right now , not my new jordan dri-fit socks which wick better . i notice there no ventilation holes shoe like most . none toe area .. none tongue .. none sides . there also no meshy fabric help ventilation either . one thing i worry " stability system " bottom shoe . long term .. it seems like it would like shox system . my local shoe expert says he gets many returns shox torn or worn shox part prematurely but never any t-macs back yet . i guess we see	1

i'm not one hyperbole , so when i say " best shoes ever " i really mean it . definitely best shoe purchase i ever made . these far most expensive shoes any kind i ever bought , they totally worth every penny . fact i bought second pair this same model because first one so good . normally i'd get five pairs running shoes price these two . ( i'd love get these deep discount , but just haven't found them anywhere . ) they take lot wear tear . i run walked well over 1,000 miles these shoes they still practically like new , just little worn center front sole . which doubly amazing considering i weigh over 250 pounds . usually i blow out pair shoes after just 300 or 400 miles . aside slightly warm they amazingly comfortable . i wear them all day work , or fifteen-mile walk , not any discomfort . fit perfect , usually that problem area me . these snug without binding , all right support right places . no appreciable wear occurred interior lining shoe . brooks very good brand me , these far away best their line i tried . compared best stuff new balance , asics , saucony , mizuno other good brands i used , beast completely different level	1

we've this carrier 7-8 months only used it go hiking - our intended purpose - handful times . we used go backpacking lot our childless days i would not say this carrier quite comfortable pack i used ( gregory ) * but * then again my gregory pack always just ridden quietly my back doesn't throw its weight around yell my ear . i think wiggle cargo accounts difference comfort , difference not big . still , i never hiked more than 6 miles my kid this i can't imagine going much further than . i'm willing admit this due more my going soft than poor pack design , though . we fit all his diaper supplies attached backpack if we use disposables , tie few toys off loops carrier , stuff sippie cup holder back , it makes nicely contained baby unit day hike . what i found this pack unexpectedly great use place stroller where strollers hinderence - such historical sites - or walking around mall or grocery store . my kid reached this point where he hates ride shopping cart tries climb out , but some reason he happy clam riding up high my back this pack . generally happier than when stroller , even . never fights get down . my husband i both use this pack comfortably . i am 5'4 use pack second smallest setting ; he 5'10 uses it maybe 2 settings bigger . i think there 8 settings all so this could certainly work well wide range people . kid perspective , my boy 30 pounds , 35 or 36 inches , he riding seat middle ( 3 ) adjustment . only thing i don't like it sunshade/rainhood , which included this model but makes this model more expensive than next model down , which i think called journey . we just never use it because it wigs my kid out so we should saved money . i also looked rei child carriers , baby trend , lower priced kelty ( base camp , i think ? ) suspension just didn't compare . pathfinder line just much , much more comfortable . i don't even understand why kelty puts out carriers like base camp . my only regret not gotten frame carrier sooner . i overestimated which point he'd ready one	1

i understand other reviewers cups larger would trouble getting this off , it pretty snug over head arms even hooks undone -- but this full-b-cup , it perfect . no bouncing , no sliding up out under bust , nice smooth look under t-shirts tank tops . i worried elastic bands would chafe scratch , but bra stays place so well it perfectly comfortable . ( maybe also because i'm not terribly generously endowed ) it doesn't create uni-[ ... ] effect me	1

i bought two different sizes this product . i initially bought large since size chart says 175lb person ; they should large - extra large brief . not true !!! size felt like regular underwear ! luckily i tried medium size found it provided much better support slimming . i not drop dress size , but i definitely look slimmer neater my clothes since no rolls bulges show through . they also very comfortable wear extended periods	1

category push up/suspensor boxers these clearly best . they work advertised : lifts gives you great profile both front back addition they very comfortable wear . but i two advices : 1 . one size larger than you normally use . 2 . buy white or black . i bought " mint green " pair which turned out girly , light blue color - certainly not color advertised	1
