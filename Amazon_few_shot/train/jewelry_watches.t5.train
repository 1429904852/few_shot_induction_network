casio g-shock atomic solar watch #gw1400da -4av sort middle road terms price ( i paid $99 ) . it not cheap but it not too expensive either . display diameter not large but it thick , tough-looking watch ( real man watch ... :) ) . it also heavy side . so , if you're looking elegant , thin watch , look somewhere else . when i first got it , power source 50% charge . after leaving watch my desk facing up towards desk fluorescent lamp left , charge reached 100% next day . solar cell seems working . time accurate too . i checked it against computer time ( which also gets synched everyday ) . it comes small manual ( very small text ) , but i found there really no need use manual all initially . it works right out box all factory settings correct . ( manual come useful when you some time your hands browse through it get clearer idea all available features . ) watch steel wristband much too large me i shorten it ( removed 4 links , actually ) . i used swiss army knife blade accomplish task . knife tip strong enough apply pressure spring loaded rod holds links together , but small get into small area wrist band metal links ( watch arrows : these tell you where apply pressure ) . you need push down ridges rod , out ( away you ) . ( down , so you make rod shorter , out so when rod shortened , wrist band link pop out ) . i accidentally scratch band but it wasn't too bad since scratch inside . ( it easy enough shorten wristband almost everyone who gets this watch this . ) careful not slice your finger open . always turn blade away your finger when applying pressure . overall , i give it 2 thumbs up looks functionality . ( note : this watch sold multiple vendors amazon . you should check one best price . when i bought it , i wasn't aware this but found out later , little too late )	-1
this very nice , affordable watch . i like not replace batteries knowing it always accurate . people who own $1000+ watches ask me it lot . when i tell them it solar powered automatically synchronizes atomic clock every night , i only paid $60 it while sale amazon , they immediately tell me they paid too much their expensive inferior watches	1

atomic watches highly-accurate quartz watches which synchronized each day time signal broadcast definitive u.s. atomic clock ft . collins , colorado . thus , all atomic watches always accurate within fraction second any time . since atomic watches adjust automaticaly daylight saving time they ultimate accurate watches . casio makes -- amazon sells -- wide selection styles atomic watches suit various needs tastes , but all equally accurate . casio g-shock series especially rugged solar powered models , such this , never require battery replacement . atomic accurary , solar power , g-shock ruggedness appealing combination quite reasonable price	1

ever notice how hard it find watch really fits arm your 6-year-old ? not any more . this not only gave my kids watch actually fits , it fun them assemble them , they still mixing up colors bands . you simply add or subtract links get perfect fit . different links provided means if it breaks , there plenty spares . there no spare clasp pieces , so if they break clasp , they're , but clasps quite sturdy , kids broken couple links without breaking clasps already . they learned aware watch their wrist , so they haven't broken any more links since first few days ( there twice many links what we need ) . overall , this great product my kids enjoy .	1

very good quality price . they simple , understated , classic design . if you want flashy , however , these not you . you ignore 1-star reviews -- 1-star rating goes those who ) don't read description before ordering , ) don't know what mm stands , or ) don't visual-spatial skills estimate size earring picture comparing overall size earwire ( which tends fairly similar size most earrings ) . please , if you can't tell 14k $5.00 dimestore stuff likely turn your ears green , then your money wasted here . go walmart get yourself something big cheap	1
i am very small featured these perfect size . light weight very well made	1
i owned both black " monster " bracelet ( my daily work watch ) orange rubber strap ( which i sold envious friend ) . besides all compliments i received those who cant help but notice robust build this model , it also paid dividends durability under rough service job . i not diving many years however this watch i would most confident wear depth . usual , seiko not disappoint	1
although this watch ( #mc0478 ) labeled kids , it best geared girl 12-years or older . timepiece portion appears better quality than jelly strap , which looks very cheap . i purchased this gift my 18-year old sister went local jeweler replaced plastic band nice blue/green leather one . overall my sister , who loves little mermaid , pleased this watch . so far she hasn't reported any problems timepiece . price , it good value timepiece , but i would recommend upgrading band . little mermaid face main reason i purchased this watch , but if you looking good quality timepiece/band , you may consider watch	-1

moment you first hold this watch your hand , you realize it quality timepiece . first thing strikes you its large size heavy feel , yet despite , it feels comfortable wrist due its fine balance . bracelet : bracelet end links ( those attach watch case ) solid rather than formed sheet metal like you find most other watches this price range . pins holding bracelet watch sturdiest i ever seen . each bracelet subsequent links also made solid piece steel , not folded sheet , each component feather-edged prevent it digging into wrist . its removable link pins unusual machined pin collar design which , though fiddly remove replace , nevertheless ensure pins remain under-flush secure when correctly installed . bracelet perfectly flush side contacts your wrist making it feel very smooth during wear . clasp very high quality , both fold over security buckle , which deploys satisfying click , omega style double button catch . security buckle closes onto spring pin whose ends spherical thus ensuring tight fastening which should not wear use . all all these features add up watch very quiet wrist , only faint sound coming its automatic winding mechanism . finally bracelet incorporates clever hidden diver extension ( allow watch worn over wet suit ) . case : watch case , back bezel made stainless steel . case attractive mix polished , brushed machined finishes which all add feel quality function . overall impression this precision instrument rather than fashion piece ; that not say though it would look out place dinner jacket any more than wet sui t.t he unidirectional bezel heavily scalloped design , protected bezel-guards which extend upwards each lug pairs . lower guard also functions crown guard , all all , impression case machined solid billet steel . bezel sits slightly higher than domed crystal , thus providing protection scratching crystal itself proprietary seiko material " hardlex " which , i understand it , better resisting scratches than mineral glass but less susceptible shattering than sapphire . luminosity this watch astounding due partly use seiko proprietary " lumibrite " paint but also large coated areas hour markers hands . bezel only turns one way , safety feature timing dives , feels silky smooth , best i've experienced any seiko or invicta diver . it 120 clicks per revolution nicely aligned face . movement : watch uses 21 jewel seiko 7s26 movement running 21,600 bph ( that 6 ticks per second ) . it non-hacking which means second hand not stop when crown pulled out . although this makes it difficult synchronize , if slight backward pressure applied fully extended crown , it possible stop second hand . watch not hand wound but self winding mechanism very efficient i found it power reserve least 24 hours . 7s26 around many years reputation ruggedness reliability . accuracy : there several reviews where people complain poor accuracy . typically , when new , automatic movements set run fast factory because they tend slow down after few weeks use . i own three watches 7s26 movement after their breaking period all now keeping time within 10 seconds per day . i few thoughts accuracy . you ask yourself how accurate your watch need ? if it running 10 or 20 seconds fast per day then set it one minute slow you only need re-set it once every week or two when it advanced one minute fast . if you need more accuracy then , unless you willing pay least five times much swiss watch , then buy quartz . finally , if you search seiko monster you'll quickly come realize its various colours , these watches firm favourites amongst those who frequent many watch forums . i would highly recommend you purchase one see yourself !	1
my granddaughter loves this bracelet - i sent it surprise she wore it school next day	1
i this winder month now i am very happy it . major convenience well-engineered slots iserts holding watches very good quality . inserts holding watches steadily which contributes proper winding . all previous more expensive winders cushion type inserts falling out ( watches ! )and eventually rendered useless . highly recommended unit	1
i several fossil watches , every time i needed adjust band , it cost me around $10 - $15 . i found this tool figured it worth try . i able remove links 2 my fossil watches , though my newest fossil watch band too wide easily fit tool . i even used it adjust watches 2 my friends . it worked well , made adjustments they very happy it ! they plan buy it themselves ! you make sure pin lines up correctly pin , but beyond , it works like dream	1

classy look very durable . very nice watch price . i bought mine discount store paid $6 more it . i like it , despite its 10mm thickness . not heavy if you're like me , 6'2 " 250lbs . it man watch , practical yet some style while not trendy . i haven't any problems it so far , despite dropped it twice worn it outside while working getting it soaked sweat multiple times . i don't find it uncomfortable all i forget i am wearing it . ( i suggest taking it off , leather band doesn't clean easily like metal band . ) i'm considering buying second one keeping it cleaner this time . ( lesson learned .	1
i ordered ( not amazon ) black titanium watch black face white hands ( model 530ltmlb , those you scoring home ) . after apologetic out-of-stock phone call dealer , i settled what i thought going same watch but white face black hands ( model 530ltmlw , you precise types ) . what i got instead this watch . photograph , it looks like dark gray matte metal white face . it not : it eggshell light gray metal mother-of-pearlish face . i hadn't worn watch five years : after all , who needs one cell-phone age ? ( definitive answer : anyone driving across country sprint cellphone ) . i took my sweet time selecting new watch , got something completely different what i ordered . i could easily returned it . before i , i slipped my wrist see what it felt like , promptly forgot it there . ( nice lady who answered my request time drop-dead-you're-wearing-a-watch response , i say it wasn't actually pickup line ? )the titanium thing not gimmick : this watch ( obviously ) very light indeed , solid . i hopes light gray colour undoctored titanium alloy , which case it still look good after life deals it some hard knocks . i set it exact ( down second ) correct time when i got it month ago . it either very good movement , or it secretly communicating atomic clock colorado without my knowledge . some reviewers complained poor latch : i respectfully suggest they don't know how close it . watch very secure double-latch , which poorly-explained but not rocket science - i've added instructions end . some complain noise : this might quality-control issue . i can't comment it because my watch quiet heartbeat fetus . ( update several weeks later : watch slowly becoming louder , but loudness changes irregularly , even when watch sitting my bed . it still very quiet , but but fact it changing not speak well long-term durability . ) it gets 4 stars because i can't tell time my glasses off , which why i wanted high-contrast watch first place . but they're not getting this one back . latch instructions : get us properly oriented , lay watch flat , face up . one end strap half clasp also contains strap length adjustment . open up clasp part . next strap length adjustment mechanism you see plain bar . now look other end strap : very end it solid , curved clasp . swing it open , you see wide double hook . put watch your wrist , attach double hook plain bar . next , close solid clasp until it clicks . next , close other clasp over first one , also until it clicks . it provably impossible any single brush up against object ( say , outboard motor ) loosen it	-1
pliers job seem well made . my only problem awkwardness trying align link . i guess if you remove band watch , it would make it easier . case i recommend one pin removers sit flat horizontal surface . but ... this job ( even leaving band watch ) . it comes smaller sized push pin breeze swap out	-1
i first purchased this watch 1994 when i entered selection coarse air force cct . i lost watch years later but i would occasionally try find replacement no luck . i now work us doj deployed baghdad while i need watch i able absolutely depend extreme conditions . this only watch i ever own . i cannot say enough it . maybe i'm sentimental but i love this watch	1
this watch great . i really loved digital feature residing analog face . i don't know others out there but analog watches only way go . i love fact i visually see what time it graphical representation , but i love digital features such alarm , timer , stopwatch , date feature . i wore watch 24/7 it never ever gave me problem , however , when i filming independent film within west texas silo i lost watch climbing ladder out . i climbing straight vertical steel pipe ladder i reached top hatch , which lead top landing , my watch face caught side steel ladder band pins broke . next thing i knew i heard " plop " new my wonderful watch its way bottom 120 foot watery depth !! i probably get one but i really would love one metal band	-1
product , i recalled , cost $36 double winder . product works quite well reasonably quiet . if one reads one watch magazines market one quickly find out there many watch winders out there most cost lot money -- hundreds thousands dollars . this product tens dollars works very well . i am very happy product -- well amazon ( dot ) com .	-1
pendant little smaller than i expected , but lovely nonetheless	-1
this second pair earrings i got silver insanity , i tell you you won't dissapointed . they may synthetic , but no one ever guess while you're wearing them ! they catch light beautifully , delicate silver design compliments gems perfectly . i always get compliments when i wear these . you can't beat price	1
this must watch serious runners . i mine over month i love mine . i am professional track field athlete , i train very hard win races . this watch helps me train better than any other watch i've ever . it gives you up 50 lap splits which great any workout over 800 meters track . not only but it 5 interval timers , which you set your appropriate rest time . if you serious runner like myself , i highly suggest you get this watch . it definately something you need	1
i like guess watches spicily gold candy rock white . gold one look like really gold	1
absolutely beautiful piece jewelry . i bought it young man birthday gift he worn it every day since ! unique eye-catching	1
this watch you would expect any timex watch . it easy read face while running , easy set , big button front light so no fumbing when wearing gloves little side button some . it lightweight if bit stiff start , but eventually easied bit age . i only use it running timing , not my everyday watch , but i'll buy one again when i lose this one ( i usually lose them long before they wear out ) . i haven't it long enough notice any real wear band yet , not sure if it'll wear out easier or not , but so far , so good ( 1 year )	1
great features this watch . i especially like linked timers three alarms . my wrist tiny , selection holes great ( i use tightest ) . this leave gap because band still bigger than my wrist , extra band wraps all way around , but it doesn't slip it feels very comfortable . alarm sound pleasant . color great too	1
i've two skagen watches say they my favorite . i love large face titanium bracelet ( you don't remove watch order shower ! ) . lot people complimented me watch , too . given price quality , you can't go wrong . if you ever need part replaced , you just send it skagen ; work completed couple weeks ! summary : elegant watch reasonable price	1

this watch generally good watch , but there some flaws ours -- not surprise considering price . one , there white haze under crystal when viewed sunlight -- perhaps result careless manufacturing cleaning . two , my son band come apart twice one month . later probably design issue relative all spring-loaded retainers such , general range movement clasp	-1

bracelets advertised , shipping reasonably promp t.t he only thing i am slightly worried whether elastic band which holds pearls strong enough last some time . these not intended me , i bought them gift my mother i only comment its longevity only after she used them some time	1
i buy more items you guys . i got them quikl	1
this watch definitely something i keep me while . it simple , elegant , came me relatively cheap . free shipping always bonus , i also came across it gold box deals , when i saw it i knew i it . it pink lighter pink center . bracelet large extra links , so i removed them took it store make it smaller . i think its great watch both casual more formal settings	1
this watch beautiful . picture don't make any justice . quality amazon flawless . highly recommended	1
it got alarm , stop watch , timer , lap timer , 5 alarms actually , water break alarm , water resistant , although don't go aggressive swimming it because water leaked inside mine , when it gets hot outside , water vapor rises glass dial it blurs out time ... but other than , it great watch , finest i've owned terms digital watch , i highly recommend it	1
i wanted inexpensive watch which keeps accurate time . this fills bill quite nicely . it sets itself daily even uses wwv " leap year " flag so you don't worry daylight savings time change . it bit fussy here pittsburgh ( hill country ) . it took bit experimentation find some place sit it overnight where it get good signal . it instructs manual sit it near window " six " watch pointed window let it sit up 10 minutes . i followed manual instructions several times . then i picked up watch right after i initiated manual search signal . i moved it around until it showed steady " 3 " ( highest signal level ) . problem solved . adjusting band should simple looking arrows pusing out pin , etc . except it require brute force . i broke jeweler screwdriver small punch process . i should bought expansion band same time	1
this watch totally accurate . glow dark hands numerals oversized date window , it perfect watch . it makes it pleasure look my wrist	1
this watch met all my requirements , it well suited my hand . i liked feature turning digital display off . strap also smooth , doest hurt ur skin . only negative remark i found this watch indiglo night-light not bright i expected or not equivalent my previous watch .	-1
i'm wristwatch fan , i modest collection nice luxury watches , i looking something inexpensive i could use " rough " activities where i don't want damage my nicer omega or rolex watches . i wanted something sport functions alarm . most sports watches digital displays ( e.g. casio or even other timex ironmans ) pretty ugly , they look out place wearing anything but sweats sneakers . but i pleasantly surprised this timex model . you turn off digital display it looks like reasonable handsome analog watch , but one press display functions appear again . however , there some drawbacks : - digits hidden thick hands analog display . - white black digital display isn't very clear except good light . you'll using indiglo backlight often . rest watch pretty nice overall . casing heavy , thick but thanks comfortable rubber band , i don't find watch annoying my small wrist . loop band hold end band secure stays put pretty well . overall weight hefty but not overbearing some other watches metal straps . finish isn't exactly rolex quality , it looks like what you expect $50 watch , brushing bit uneven . design modern smooth , watch looks bit more expensive than it . functions watch pretty typical any digital watch . there isn't anything watch i find confusing . long you walk through functions once manual , you shouldn't problems doing it again later without manual . usually you hold top left button go into set modes , other buttons go up/down or advance setting mode . i could completely figure out watch without manual . sport functions , three loop countdown timers allow you set up intervals . example , you one loop time running interval , then second loop walk break . chrono function keeps track 42 laps , you see each lap time recall mode . however , because hands easily cover digits , i wouldn't suggest this watch if you really need able read digits all times , stick digital only ironman modelthe indiglo backlight just adds enough light digits allow you see light any lighting condition , but i said , you'll more likely use it this watch because low contrast digits . alarm average digital watch , it good enough wake most people when placed bedside ( it isn't very loud worn wirst )	-1
this big watch price ! (44mm i believe ) .... you buy vintage dive watch find one this large ..... i agree other reviewer strap . i lost casio just like this before @ beach . i now " waterborne " dive-strap my new one ..... one directional bezel screw-down crown would nice future models ... also ready asked " what time it ?

oddly , skx175 i received actually skx009k ! what steal $129 ! watch 5-star based price alone . but jubilee bracelet gets 1-star !! it cheap feeling loose . center links fold-over , not solid . this price though , it not surprising something got cheaped out like . overall , i give it 4-star rating . missing tag !!! false advertising ( perhaps benefit , 009k perceived little better ) it really skx009k rather than skx175 ( singapore labeling lower edge dialface , whereas skx009k not any country markings ) . great buy sure !! cheers	-1

you tired replacing watch batteries ? you bump into things your watch ? if so , buy this one . it beautiful , practical watch that available very good price . it winds itself mechanically you move your wrist . no batteries . it shock- water-resistant . bang it around , swim it , wash dishes it , shower it . no problem . it gold-plated stainless steel , gold-plated stainless steel band . it beautiful . it big , so if you small wrists , buy ladies version , if not , buy men version .	1
great item , don't go looking huge diamonds , but it looked good over all . my girlfriend loved it so i guess that most important thing	1
great looking watch , i shopped around best price three weeks before i ordered amazon . shipped lightning quick also	1

this item exactly advertised . well designed , well made , heavy . my only complaint ( reason 4 stars ) chain way short . i knew this when i ordered it so i other arrangements made , but 26 " or 28 " chain would much better , my opinion , than 20 " . great value money , however	-1

watch actually better than it appeared photo . one few times when i actually state something even better value than it appeared	1
i've watch week now i'm very happy it . both digital analog time exact second after week ( checked against apple network time server ) . watch looks good i can't say i've problem digital display - if it brighter i think it would tend distracting . slide rule looks good but i doubt more than 1% buyers actually use it . one small negative point i noticed although hands luminous hour markers aren't , which makes things little tricky complete darkness - silly oversight , hence 4 stars . overall though , well worth money	-1
my grand son calls my wife " nana " so i get it her mothers day . great product	-1
i love this watch . it perfect swim workouts aquathlon races -- takes splits , intervals , etc . i use different product heartrate monitor my runs , but can't use it my swims ( since heartrate monitors can't transmit under water , also , unit itself not waterproof ) . this timex audible chime under water , it easy set various functions . it stores your workout splits so you recall them later when logging your workout . i also love 3 alarms - my schedule different every day , so i use alarms remind me when leave work school , when leave pick up my son , etc . i lost my first watch ( same model ) , but never found watch all features i wanted reasonable price . this my second one !	1
i've used this model watch past three years my cross-country career thoroughly enjoyed it . it very light not bulky all - something every runner looks watch . , interval timer really comes handy when doing timed work outs or when simply doing crunches . fit so comfortable not cut or chafe . also , battery life outstanding (+ 1 year ) . though , i few issues . i broke off band keeps excess watch strap place - though may my own doing roughness sports i play . also , i've return watch replacement due water damage . sure , it covered warranty - but it still hassle deal if problem comes up - though , i've only experienced this when steam gets into watch or while swimming high pressure circumstances - like when diving . said , when i lost watch - i immediately replaced it same model . if you're looking light , sleek , versatile watch this definitely .	-1
i ordered these earrings thinking they'd round picture seems imply . they're really nice but honestly , they're not round they look image , which i found tad disappointing first . they're not totally flat or anything like but drops look bit " flatter " person than they picture . i'm not blaming amazon or silver insanity it since they've nothing wrong . products look different pictures than person due things like light camera angles . i just want give notice people who buy these earrings . yes , they substantial piece jewelry previous reviews imply , but not so big they're distracting or gaudy or overly heavy . they're very nice .	1
these gorgeous earrings just happened match pendant i already . i've many compliments them	1
band face both so much darker than they look picture . also , amazon neglected send owners manual warranty information ( i contact skagen this ) . watch very attractive though	-1
i'm picky person when it comes watches . i'm very rough them . this watch far exceeded my expectations all accounts . its so light i often forget i'm even wearing watch . i've gotten several comments it well . only negative thing i say this watch mesh material band difficult get water out . i useally take mine off wash my hands . overall its good looking , well made , tough time piece	1
i owned this watch nearly 3 years now , it wonderful . it looks great , i never replace battery ( according citizen , i never either ) , it keeps perfect time . clasp very easy operate it fits very well . it definitely lightest watch i ever owned . i only 2 gripes , one small , one could killing point some people . small gripe crown ( used change time/date/day ) bit difficult pull out correct position move date ( months less than 31 days ) . you pull it only halfway out ( pulling it out fully allow you set time ) , but it tendency go past fully out or fully closed . larger gripe this watch scratches very easily . i use computer everyday extended periods my job . because this , bottom band scratched considerably my desk which leaves dark grey marks my desk scratches band . i also scratched metal part bezel just bumping into something . titanium nice light , but probably not best metal watch , especially if you plan wearing it daily basis ( even office environment )	-1
these earrings very nice quality what i expected . i am pleased these	1

i searching watch weeks , saw picture this watch paused . intrigued i began read specs : alarm , chronograph , thermometer , light , stopwatch , world-time zones more , what catch ? $55usd c'mon seriously all those features all ? i still skeptical but when i got watch put it my wrist i sold . solid , well crafted , unique sporty/elegant combination . my only gripe slight increase body temperature give innacurate room temperature . we can't world but casio come close this price i honestly say go it	1
just got my watch today . it perfect watch . i shopping around i thrilled find it amazon more than $100 less than retail stores ! ilove it .	1
i rec'd this today . i looking while white faced stainless watch kept coming back this one bulova . ( i looked nearly two years ! ) i some looking around online stores amazon far best price ( they beat everyone least $100 ) , so i what any girl would , i bought it . it substantial watch . it not watch someone looking something dainty or unassuming . i don't think it heavy , it just feels like you've got watch . i personally like size weight . i plan this my spring/summer watch until it dies or something happens it . i seiko coutura black mop face w/diamonds i love , but i wanted something different but sort same this one it .	1
they sparkle well look good anything else i seen mall stores . i like non-cup style studs , i think they allow more light flow through stone . save your cash get these . she very happy you spend extra money fishing lures or something . ;-)d o not go jared jewelers if they near you ... they evil people .	1
soon i saw this watch i get it . i loved it because it really nice details butterflies beautiful . it really nice looking good quality watch . only problem i it face quite big . if you small wrist it very large . i still love it would never return it but feel like it could lot smaller .	1
i very pleased this purchase . these earrings very simple yet elegan t.t hey could worn jeans or more dressed up occasion . good choice price	1
very nice watch price . very low profile nice flexible band . would like smaller face but otherwise great watch	-1
this bracelet very simple elegant . pav� cz great sparkle , but isn't overboard . i also like fact it rolo bracele t--t he links delicate small , but very sturdy nice gleam them . furthermore , charm " o " nice style doesn't look gaudy . there some tiny little dots back charm ( not so sure what those all ) . this bracelet looks great stacked top my silver bracelet watch . wearing any bracelet make it hard type , but this one cool because you actually peg it nice tight your wrist wrapping " stick " part clasp beneath rolo chain if you want it out way . i get compliments every time i wear this bracelet ; so , it nice it supports good cause since it get noticed . obviously , if you're looking fine jewelry , this might not your choice , but they say , " diamonds forever , but cz right now . " ;-) i would recommend this those their teens , but even women their twenties thirties who like whole sterling-silver bling-thing . also , definitely recommended those interested supporting good causes such ovarian cancer awareness .	1
works great , fits well , nice design . definitely recommend i	1
order arrived time ; packaged very nicely . they quality earrings which one my concerns buying on-line , not able handle them . price fair . i would recommend would myself purchase again	-1
awesome watch . i absolutely love it . incredible value this price	1
nice quality . it shame they not same longer cords well	1
i ordered one these time i spend gym track running , also it good choice if you go swimming every once while . course , price you not getting professional sports watch like omega seasmaster , but occasional use it just great . it all you need - stop watch , alarm , nice light timex calls indiglo , etc . it also comes black plastic strap feels good unlike leather really " water-friendly " . anyway , who needs 50m water-resistant watch if strap " survive " nothing more than splash water . far accuracy - so far it ok . i it 4 months now i adjust it only once -- it 2 seconds behind . it doesn't fancy functions you would find casio g-shock series , like address book stores 50 names numbers or sophisticated stop-wtach split times or measure per lap time , nor it altimeter , but then again you get it less then $20 . overall , i give this nice timex 5 stars - it great value watch occasional use	1
my wife liked it . it shiny . what more said . :-) i wish smaller heart little larger . you barely tell what it	1
see all over double price . works great , get lots compliments more my more expensive watches .	1

i've owned several watches , including older g-shock casio men g-shock atomic solar watch # gw1400da-9av ( among others ) . first , there so many g-shock models choose . you could bought # gw1400da-9av ( stainless steel model ) same price ($75 ) during week july 24 , 2006 . this watch simply everything one ever needs time functionality : solar power ( no need daily rewinding , kinetic body movement , or batteries ) , synch atomic clock colorado ( ultimate accuracy ) , time zone adjustment ( ease jet setters ) , light button ( which also goes off when you tilt your wrist ) , stop watch functionalities , day/date functionalities , countless other time-related functions . this respect , it much more functional than patek ( even complicated wrist watch models , or more mundane rolex , etc . ) . course , it lowly casio , costing mere $75 ( vs . $ 75,000 low end complicated patek)buyers should aware watch purtty bulky , probably 5/8 3/4 . thick . one needs sporty forearm/wrist go this watch . fun wearing it couple times year , price , just look it part collection watches , i'd highly recommend it .	1

very nice watch but ... it much smaller lighter than i thought it would . i read it smaller than seiko divers , this plus since seiko too large me . however ... this watch could stand just tad bigger . more pluses ... dial markers glows blue tint , instead green most watches . rubber band quite comfortable secure using 2 " hold downs " excess length goes thru buckle . downside ... citizen logo imprinted band . this bit much imo , but i'm sure it eventually wear off . overall very nice watch ... just not big diver watch one might expect	1
my wife loved this small gift , they quite attrative not break bank . would great gift my daughter or niece well	1

i purchased these earrings i am excited quality but not size . fair , i knew little diamond studs until i research amazon learned bunch over course couple weeks , but one thing i wish i'd seen pictures diamond studs " actual " size next each other - i.e. not blown up screen look pretty . 1/4 , 1/3 , 1/2 , 3/4 , 1 carat total weight pairs would nice see all once . i seen this i might opted larger size ( perhaps slightly lower quality so afford it ) . yes , you print helpful " actual size " report amazon , but this not any small sizes except 1/2 1 carat studs ( nothing ) . one more thing , gemological report i received not detailed " sample " website . there appears actual photo my diamonds my report but you not see drawings show flaws occlusions . this would nice . also , there fewer descriptive terms ratings than i expected . example , my certificate it says " g-g/g-g " polish symmetry . although it bound presented well , i hoped something more like sample website . flip side , these diamonds really high quality . i compared them coworkers larger studs it immediately apparent these colorless clear ( my eyes ) while others bit cloudy not nice . quality studs advertised . one stud vs-1 other vs-2 color both g-h . total carat weight 0.72 ( not 0.75 hoped ) but this above guaranteed minimum spec . 0.70 . product received very quickly , well packaged presented . i would absolutely purchase this type thing amazon again ..	-1

watch winder works exactly described . i think this good value product . especially when compared multi hundreds dollar watch winders market . it look little bit plastic . but winder well built reasonably quit when turning . it comes 4 different timer settings 3different turning direction settings : left , right alternating . i calculated number rotations per day based some measurements . setting : : rotate 33 seconds , rest 12 minutes : 300 rotations/day : rotate 10 minutes , rest 90 minutes : 660 rotations/day : rotate 30 minutes , rest 3 hours : 940 rotations/day d: rotate 1 hour , rest 3 hours : 1700 rotations/dayi use setting my watch eta 2824 movement . every watch specific requirement how many rotations per day it needs remain fully wound . see you watch specifications . winder not come possibillity run batteries , pity i think . i just bought it i not say anyting long term reliabillity but assuming it keeps running i think this i very good buy . so far i am very pleased it	-1

i looking watch i would feel comfortable wearing business engagements yet still not feel over-accessorized walking though home depot . this watch came up numerous times searches amazon . criteria i looking 1 ) sapphire crystal , 2 ) multi-faced dial , 3 ) not too flashy , 4 ) price . biggest problem typical " fashionably sporty " watch faces too big or too thick or simply contrasts too much band . i dislike black faced dials polished bezel band . this watch it all . watch utmost quality . you could go macy pay $400 this same watch . band nicely polished clasp typical seiko , that good . hands all aligned perfectly 12 position adjustable if they're not . mine not out box . hands actually blue , but provides nice hint color otherwise bland face , very appealing . there nice weight watch . its actually lighter than other similarly sized steel watches i've . there no light , so previous reviewers comments after-hours time checks accurate . hands typical luminescent hands . they hold light 20 minutes maybe . you won't waking up night check time this time piece , but that why you alarm clock . deciding factor me sapphire crystal . it must . i'm not one spend $500 watch because i'm very hard them . mineral crystal simply too easily scratched . i liked some citizen designs , but simply won't spend kind money mineral crystal . seiko quality , sapphire crystal under $150 this steal . overall , i'm very happy ; 5 stars .	1

i honestly wasn't expecting much $1.99 although i buy two them . what surprise though . very very nice little bracelets . very tiny white creamy bead type pearls irregular shapes look very good way fit my wrist very easily look great . i pushed them up my arm bit so they fit little tighter , looks better way i think . identical i think well what pictured amazon page . i also own expensive pearls no they aren't nice those but money it sweet somewhat elegant look . especially when you wear two them together . yes they definately cute stretchy . not bad 5 bucks altogether . it ain't mikimoto but i am absolutely satisfied .	1

this watch very nice . it goes dress or pair jean . however , this watch very tiny , diameter this watch less than 20mm ( including stainless ring ) it exactly 15mm diameter dial , so if you middle large wrist ( you probably want go different watch , because big wrist ( sadly , which i am ) this watch just don't go together ! ) i wish amazon indicated little detail watch information before i brought this watch . anyway , thing pink color dial , it not light pink like i expecting/hoping . it more like milky light peach pink , i can't even describe color , i think it kinda strange pink . ( maybe it just watch i receive or something , i am not sure ) . overall , i still think this nice watch , which i think it truly deserves 4 stars current price they selling .	-1
solid good looking watch those who like or need databank function . i like my phone numbers watch even though i use my cell phone directory more . you store other data involving names/numbers well ( i.e. birthdays ) overall very satisfied yet some issues follows : ( 1 ) no second hand . ( 2 ) multiple alarms nice snooze feature nice yet alarm tone little quiet if you're deep sleeper . ( 3 ) backlight not great . you need look hard see time . definitely can't use if driving want glance quickly time . ( 4 ) databank 2 pages which scrolled back forth . ( 5 ) watch heavier than databank/calculator it replaced . much more stylish though . i would recommend highly am looking buy one different color . $20-$30 this watch great purchase	-1

this long-standing standard solidly designed well-priced diver watch . i owned this model watch several years . only reason why i get new one because my old one gets too beat up scratches like , but not because any failure . mineral crystal superior resisting scratches so much more quality than cheap plastic type . stainless steel case looks good offers rugged protection internal components . i never situation where water leaked into internal part watch . you get best both types displays ( analog digital ) . i put dual time function use when i travel overseas don't want readjust analog display . this no-brainer if you market diver style watch	1
