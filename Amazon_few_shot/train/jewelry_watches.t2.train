if you check out page you find this " womens " watch $133.99 you also find " mens " version just $98.00 . why would this ? if anthing because gold plating mens watch much larger , it would cost more make mens watch . more size , more gold , more gold , higher price make . little thing bothers me both watches shown together little " better together " hook . better who ? there not once cent discount buying together . i own invicta no trouble it . i would buy pair my wife i . but , i am not going toss out extra $35.99 womens watch just because invicta and/or amazon feel they charge more if anything product would not cost much make . man , it seems women would really get hot over this	1

i paid over $150 this watch couple years ago , i loved it when i first bought it ( many other reviewers this page ) . however , it took 18 months band break , then less than 2 years watch completely die . solar charger slowly quit working - first i just couldn't set hands watch because it stuck " recover " mode , but digital display still correct so it still somewhat usable . then after few months this , everything went blank . i sent it off casio expecting quick , inexpensive repair ( or even free repair , i expected them stand behind their product ) . shortly thereafter , i received repair estimate $94.11 - more than watch currently sells brand new ! so ... my opinion , watch probably worth $69.00 it currently sells , but don't expect it last more than year or two . i won't buying casio	-1

i received my new fossil watch just few weeks ago . first , i pleased watch . overall appearance nice , its very dainty thin band . green dial pale lime green , not too bright . everything going good until yesterday when i noticed watch seemed stopped working ( this only after 2 weeks it !! ) . i reset time it started ticking again , so i thought it just fluke . now it working sometimes but generally running slow ( time keeps falling farther behind ) . if this battery problem already i am very disappointed amazon would send out new watch old battery . i expect take this up them , obtaining new battery isn't very easy because there isn't fossil store nearby . manual it says mail watch new battery , which costs $15 !! how inconvenient . i am not impressed	1

i little apprehensive these waveceptor watches after reading reviews them . common complaints included scratches face , atomic synching problems , difficulty setting up watch first time . i received my watch it perfect condition , no scratches , light or otherwise . it light but construction feels solid . i wondering what initial setup going like , since others claimed it taken hours (!!!) . it literally took me 15 seconds . it involves holding button down 5 seconds , pressing other button few times . once it set up , watch immediately synched itself my local time no problems all ( i live central florida . ) i've only owned watch day now i must say i'm impressed it so far . i haven't experienced any troubles mentioned other reviews , i'm very satisfied my purchase . also , i chose super saver shipping , amazon told me it'd take 3 weeks get it me . i received it 4 days	1
locker rooms office corridors across this nations , battle rages souls men . perhaps only fratricidal dispute boxers briefs more violently bloodied masculine nose our generation than this battle . yet jury remains out : wallet or money clip , what'll it ? lives careers savaged choice one over other , yet passion drives guys direction traditonal leather wallet or - alternatively - minimalist money clip continues unabated . titanium money clip scores victory latter . small , lightweight , attractive , it cleans hip pocket out , straightens hang trouser , facilitates quick snatch bill when wallet guys still sorting through receipt they carelessly shoved their banknotes . only complaint regarding this product it requires five or six bills , minimum , before it sufficient wad clasp firmly . other than ... well ... i can't even remember where i tossed my wallet	1

i bought this item my grandaughter whose birthday august . i think she like it lot . i know i	1
we bought this watch my 8-year old -- who loves it . we deliberately wanted him develop his time-telling skills ( i.e. , no digital watches please ! ) , " cool " watch , too . velcro strap , second hand , water-resistant qualities ( " i wear it shower , mom ! " ) , indiglo face ( very cool movie theaters ) made this great buy .	1
it good value money -- too rough edges	1
i bought this watch two months back am using it casual watch . but it would go formal dress even . works promised ; i tried synching this watch two countries , three signalling stations several time zones , it works perfectly well . quote cons , it bit chunky , but that ok since i'm using it casual watch . back watch plastic , which makes it look cheap but don't know if there any specific reason . also it would've gratified my every needs , there ' indiglo ' or ' nightglo ' feature . complete darkness , irradiating hands look fine , but if it half light , then i spend second or two searching hands . these minor things i am perfectionist , so here i stamp 4 stars it .	1
i've only this watch week , so can't really comment long term durability . however , it ultra cool watch . although i've not got scale handy moment , but it seems lighter than my ipod nano . really featherweight watch , therefore very comfortable wear . dial color really can't adaquately captured picture . it very attractive , much more striking than image indicates . several people asked where i purchased it . i'm very happy this choice	1
watch everything i hoped except i wish blue dial little brighter blue . handsome , just not impressive or eye catching . other than minor complaint , it very slim very comfortable wear . you don't even feel it your arm	1

wife hard time watches this one made her very happy	1
exceptional value classy understated design . keeps time superior fashion highly recommended	1
this watch great . it recharges itself , self adjusts atomic clock , world time , auto lighting , etc ... just mention few features . this shock series , it really sturdy scratch/water/weather/heat/shock resistant ! it both digital analog hand view time(whichever convenient ) . this synchronizes atomic clock(time daylight savings ) which means you need not adjust time . interesting feature if you tilt your hand dark towards you then watch lights up showing you time ! there few cons . there no seconds hand it(but there digital second indicator ) . this watch slightly heavy huge . but after few months you get adjusted it . you need go through manual there so many features you only four buttons	1
i bought this watch gift friend who requested this exact one . he loves it . personally lights come off far too frequently no reason would little too much me . it certainly largest wrist watch i come across but if this what you're looking knowing it g-shock which makes it great watch , this one you	1

im 14 i go school .... i bought this watch because i got nice allowence wow people school thinks im rich cool : !!!!!	1
watch even more attractive than it appeared . i none noise problems described other reviews . mesh bracelet not comfortable leather bands i am used . low light it sometimes difficult see ( my eyesight good ) . but basically i am very satisfied	1
this one excellent price . good build accurate . i wish it alert function	1
i'm pretty big guy so it doesn't look out place , but this really extra large watch also quite heavy . it runs well , keeps good time movement very good reputation reliability . if you're extra large person don't mind heavy watch , you may interested this . if you're average size or smaller , i wouldn't recommend it . personally , this my weekend watch because it comes across pretty bullet-proof normal use	1
i've this week , it may not function well year , something you might want keep mind reading this . so far , however , it great replacement wallet . don't get me wrong , i still my wallet likely use it when travelling . but everyday use this far more practical comfortable carry . it also easy eyes it pocket - equally pleasant carry look . feels sturdy durable ; light but not flimsy . this hold upto 5 cards maybe 20 bill notes . warned , however , although clip hold 5 credit card-sized cards ( id , whatever else you may ) it only really easy remove topmost bottom most cards . , if you 5 cards you use quite often you may want look else where . personally , i id top my credit card bottom . other three cards ones i almost never use , or use very rarely . one concerns i purchasing this whether or not it securly hold less than 5 cards . it ( there pressure clips sides where card goes ) , but i wouldn't recommend it . just didn't feel safe enough , even 4 cards . something i not foresee purchasing this clip secures money very tightly . consequently : 1 ) when you press down clip , it drags money back few millimeters . if you put money too far back it'll crumple it up . 2 ) when secured , you can't just pull out bill , you lift clip up . first point i've found little more bothersome than second , but after playing around it half hour or so i've got hang clamping it without crumpling money . said , it really very nice item would awesome gift give friend , husband , father , or your own personal use - if it suites their or your dress style . ( if you wondering why it 4 star not 5 ... well , no real good reason . it deserve 5 stars , but little issues clip tugging money you clamp it down - although it means money held more securely - holding less than 5 cards didn't feel too secure , pulling out any card other than top bottom most cards difficult , dropped it down 4 . it may just these issues neccessary keep product fanatastic it . 4.5 stars might welcome option , this close perfect it gets .	1
this pendant really nice . i bought it gift . it just pendant so you get chain .	1
i love these ! they such good deal price , come nice box . they much better than what i expecting . : ) colours nice pastel , would go lots different things . pearls large but not too large - just right	1
these earrings really pretty . there not real great variations color each set ( they all pastel , after all ! ) but each beautiful sheen color . they also set very firmly backs - i worried , price , they wouldn't hold up . but they very nicely made . packaging okay , but not deluxe . what i appreciated there little flyer enclosed telling how take care pearls , which i found informative . all all good purchase well worth money	1
i skeptical this watch because very low price but i very pleasantly surprised . it quality finish band , comfortable , works great here east coast . it reliably synchs colorado time signal so it always accurate . great watch money , i highly recommend this yellow dial watch its black blue dial siblings	1
it nice watch dollar spent this item . catch it work concept wave-ceptor . it adjusts time according place you . so ... good watch ..!	1
photo necklace looked pretty , but i didn't realize it would so nice ! my daughter loved it i probably purchase one myself	1
my wife problem earrings because she needs small prong . i ordered her other earrings but i return them because they hurt her ears . these nice change because she wear them without pain . plus she loves them	1
i love this watch , i've it almost year . its absolutely beautiful , but simple . it keeps time very well . work i i don't wear this watch work . so i go sometimes full week without wearing it . hands stop after sitting still 24 hours but soon i pick it back up give it shake , hands spin around sets itself . its not dressy casual wear , but it also fits perfectly suit tie . i highly recommend it !	1
first impressions : it nice watch clear look . i little worried lack backlighting , but pleasantly suprised i able see luminescent dials clearly any hour night . pros : quick atomic time synchronization ( usually within one two minutes after initial synchronization ) . simple use . cons : case described stainless steel , but back piece plastic . originally listed amazon solar-powered watch , but instead powered regular battery . battery life expectancy 2 years , though it may lost longer disabling auto-sync feature . overall comments : this my first atomic time wrist-watch . it automatically synchronizes atomic time once midnight ( function you disable if desired ) or on-demand press button or two . it this scanning radio signal . according instructions , you're supposed leave this watch near window 6-o'clock side facing window best radio-signal reception . reception course vary depending your location , but watch successfully updated several times even while i wearing it . i like watches flat crystal surfaces , because it allows me paste pda screen-proctector ( cut size , course ) them , which keeps crystal scratching . crystal this watch only slightly curved , only one direction , meaning screen protector sticks nicely evenly i t.t he watch waterproof 50 meters , which ( casio terms ) means you go swimming it , but you should not press any buttons underwater . i try keep my watches away water when i , but it always good know it should survive most water-related mishaps	1
i brought this good friend xmas 2006 season . he just loved it claimed it quite beautifu	1
watch shipped timely manner , actually i receive watch few days sooner than expected delivery date . i purchased this product gift my son . when i opened package it everything site said it would more . my son i am very pleased watch . i agree previous review stating this watch not small frame man . although , this not problem me because my son likes larger watches , i took it it resized him it fits perfect	1

if you trying buy decent set pearls don't really good frame referance - these you . my wife jewler she likes pearls . i bought these got positive feedback . i nervous but when they showed they heavy looked great . you ok if you go these	1
i ordered this jewelry piece gift box card . box , while attractive first glance , flimsy , got slightly crushed transit , ribbon its top frayed pasted-on . card came it much too large fit inside box or even top gracefully , message inside not centered , making it impossible trim down . said message inside appears written plain old times new roman script . i could far better my own printer , cost , i could get much more attractive card store . i say , however , piece itself looks every bit nice it photos . i might order silver insanity again , but i'm not paying any " frills " - they just aren't putting enough work into it make it worth it	1
i ordered pair myself liked them . stones pretty clear cute but earrings smaller than shown picture .	1
watch just discribed . it heavy large . person i bought it get several links removed . it would great larger man	1

i received this watch yesterday would like counter some comments other reviews . watch i received no scratches crystal . it packaged nicely . it not seem too thick . it not appear cheap or lightweight . although back plate two buttons plastic , rest watch sturdy metal , it feels solid . wristband just right size me , although i gorilla wrist . i didn't find manual difficult understand . watch attempted auto-sync overnight , but didn't get signal , so i manually sync'ed it next day according instructions no problem . easy-to-read dial , low price ( $35 ) , overall great atomic watch worth twice what i paid	1
i this watch more than 5 years , wear it daily . i purchased it cayman , i think i paid lot more than amazon price . i love eco-drive , it never needs attention . year ago , eco-drive mechanism went bad , i sent it citizen . they replaced mechanism free , saying it their issue . kudos them . i able scratch crystal , but only after heavy abuse :) number band around outside still turns well day i bought it . numbers metallic band around face never worn off , but outside band nice smooth edge it now . lettering wore off band after year , so if you plan use dive table band , don't wear it daily . else , smart carry your own dive table old plastic card or your dive computer . band now finally worn out after 5 years ( which how i ended up here ) . two small strap holders just broke off past 2 weeks ( they wore through ) , band cracking but only holes ( still holds just fine ) . i would buy this watch again , obviously recommend it .	1
i love look this watch ! i enjoyed it almost two weeks now it kept perfect time date . originally i attracted seiko skx173 which i came across first . however i concerned physical size seiko might too large my wrist plus reviews indicated its automatic/mechanical movement might not accurate i wanted . later i found this citizen watch which looks virtually identical , yet it smaller ( diameter 38mm vs 43 , height 10.5 mm vs 13.5 ) , more accurate battery-driven quartz movement . it also longer warranty ( 5 years vs 3 ) which probably indicates movement more likely trouble-free than self-winding seiko . only negative i encountered it ( well seiko ) come fairly bulky rubber strap . while this more comfortable than i expected , it tend interfere somewhat drape cuff when wearing long sleeve shirt .	1
just my title states- this item purchased gift . my friend loves pendant , but upon arrival it small scratch body horse	1
this great watch , excellent service . order arrived time i love watch	1

this not first tool i'ld add my work bench , but it some pieces i'm glad . i re-sized my watch band just few minutes only one little incident doing something wrong way . i mention instructions somewhat lacking ? hind-sight i should figured it out before i made mistake , but that hind-sight you . if your good working tools , you need adjust watchband least every christmas , then this good deal	1
great kit working watches . tools quite good quality , not flimsy cheap . case also good , thankfully wasn't just typical throw away plastic crap . inside case firm foam keeps tools nicely place . case itself firm black leather-like material snaps closed . kit contains hammer , band holding base , several different sized pin drivers removing band pins . also includes clamp type pin remover ( blue thing ) , set screwdrivers thin but sturdy wedge removing watch backs . all all i'm quite pleased product . it just what i wanted wasn't very expensive	1
this best g-shock i owned . it looks sleek well casual . i no trouble receiving nightly signal ( i live northern new jersey ) . solar power added bonus . really good deal money	1
since i never purchased watch croton , i not know what expect . watch came 2 boxes , first black cardboard box detailing croton brand silver top center lid . inside this box , watch itself encased nice padded black leather case croton name embossed top center lid . inside lid , there " pocket " stores instruction guide warranty card , which neatly concealed behind black piece material croton logo silver text . needless say , i feel good presenting this gift my boyfriend . watch itself substance it . shape watch face unique it looks like more rounded rectangle . face blue , what nice there bit light texturing face . blue color seems change dark lighter depending lighting room . numbers clearly visible , but date bit small side , but not terrible . when i took watch out case , i noticed it not running first , i feared watch battery dead . this not case however , i found watch pin side pulled out , which stopped watch . i am not sure why this , perhaps it conserve watch battery ? back watch croton name etched into center underneath , it states it sapphire crystal , japanese quartz movement water resistant details . bracelet , it not seem heavy i thought it would , but i better idea after my boyfriend tries it . however , i am expecting he need get watch sized fit his wrist , but this not all surprises me this common practice many his watches . other reviews mention , instruction booklet not this specific watch not so helpful . all all , i think this nice watch . its design simple , yet elegant . i think it good business casual watch , it dressed up office , yet worn after hours weekends . nice feature fact it water resistan	1

i owned this watch over month now i note following : watch diameter approximately 40mm around 10mm thick . both these number seem average it looks good average size wris t.t he watch bit heavy , but sits comfortably wrist . bracelet rarely pulls hair , although i plenty i t.t he watch easy accumulate scratches , but not glass . i scratched steel around glass ( well other places ) , but sapphire resists remarkably . time keeping very accurate , compared atomic clock web . after month it advanced less than half second ahead , which result six second difference most per year . i guess results may vary different watches , but it seems nevertheless impressive trustworthy enough . timer very easy start , stop reset , one button pushes . very fast convenien t.t he alarm barely heard , so not appropriate waking . it useful though reminders , noise free location . not difficult set , but takes some time , comparable setting alarm cell phone . since it relative secondary time keeping mechanism , you second time zone set advance alarm relative tha t.t his watch not seem attract special attention it not gained any comments so far , without me bringing it conversation . pretty conservative , but i personally like tha t.t he price this watch amazon seems fluctuate 100 140 dollars . if price higher than 130 , i would wait tad , but not hold my breath too long . it definately worth money though , since i seen several seiko watches like this one enter their 20 or 30 years age still continue strong . dependable , accurate , water proof watch every occasion , most probably you cannot better than this	1

silver insanity best accessories !!! i saw image ring amazon immediately fell love . i love rings covers your proximal phalanx ( bone your finger closest your hand ) . when i received ring , ( earlier than counted upon ) , i little disappointed see how little it looked how dainty but before i tried it . i expecting ring bulky glad it wasn't . fingers surrounding it wasn't bothered or irritated thx rings slimness . i recommend using ring size chart b/c i thought i'd 6 ; turns out , i'm 7 . what misleading , though , picture . leaves shown bright , but it looks noticably darker ( inside outer rimming leaf , where gems ) when you it your hands . my fingers long slender . ring didn't twist or turn , but it didn't cover my proximal phalanx completely . i'll measure ... end bottom leave end top , it 3.3 cm . my middle proximal phalanx ( bone your middle finger closest your hand ) 3.8 cm . if you should run your fingers through your hair , leaves not get entangled ! nice ! you wear damn ring everywhere !!! i love it	1

my son tells me he loves his watch would give it 500 out 5 stars . he saved up it , he bought it his own money after his adhd asperger self trouble walking home library one too many times when it time ( after more than few reminders ) . he'd also missed cello lessons school very frustrated himself difficulties he . it cool watch . it looks good , it two alarms ( cello lesson whatever else he needs ) stop watch countdown timer -- he found use so far . it waterproof/or resistant , so means when he forgets take it off before his bath it ok . this watch way he could solve his own problems , reorganize his own life make up some his difficulties . that why i like it so much . it all these features looks really cool it doesn't cost arm leg . that best , i think . i'm not sure if he'll ever need lap timer or pacing feature or anything like . i suppose those features awesome those who use them , but our purposes our budget , this watch perfect	1

this my third skagen watch . design ultra thin titanium consturction makes it ultra light . design sophisticated enough dress sleek enough sports wear . they proven reliable timekeepers i liked this one so much i bought two more my sons . less than $80.00 each they real bargin	1
i read reviews people saying their watch scratched lost paint it . mine not this exception clasp . since watch band titanium it should anondized , meaning it not going come off . however clasp few other small parts ( watch hands ) made stainless steel , so they start losing their finish after awhile . after wearing this watch few weeks , i went put my old stainless steel citizen watch . it felt huge felt like it weighed ton . i went weighed each them . citizen came around 4.5 oz , while skagen came around 1.5 oz . it also very thin , i used not able wear watch since typing computer all day band would irritate me , not any problems skagen . one other thing note , picture this item shows steel watch ( you see it face ) , if you want see picture titanium one , take product number go skagen site , or google . skagen lost star because paint coming off clasp ( not band )	1
i am extremely impressed feel , look general quality watch . it contains citizen miyota 21 jewel automatic movement true workhorse fraction price . comfortable stainess steel pinned link bracelet worth price watch . it rounded flexible brushed steel wrist links foldover adjustable double safety clasp uses pins well . easily mistaken watch costing much more . mineral glass crystal scratch resistant - but not good sapphire watch face , but less prone chipping or shattering than sapphire crystal . display watchback also mineral glass - displaying undecorated miyota automatic movement . it look stylish run well my other watches , , i receive many comments if not more invicta . it great looking watch ! good value , accurate stylish if you like sub ' look . this good day-to-day knock watch still looks better than quartz stuff same price band . if it lasts 5 years it more than paid itself	1
i've found i receive quite few compliments whenever i wear this necklace . great color combo not too heavy . price right	1
this watch looks feels great me . yes , i take out 6 links get good fit , but fairly easy only took 5 minutes ( which included figuring out how it , which i'll explain end ) . clasp locks well - firm , but not difficult lock/unlock , very secure . i little suprised how lightweight links/band . that only part watch feels little cheap . don't get me wrong , it well constructed , but it not like big manly steel band . end day , i found i loved it because it isn't heavy . i didn't give it full 5 stars because after it few weeks there teeny tiny scratch developed face/crystal . i'm really cautious gentle it , so i'm rather disappointed this happened . ( it very possibly might me knocking up against brick wall or something ) . if you're especially rough your things , this might not best watch you . taking links out easy if you're not completely inept . you'll want something small sort-of pointy ( i happened filed-down mini screwdriver , but nail would probably work just well ) . i found it easiest first disconnect standard clasp - just push pin ( either side ) wiggle clasp apart . make sure you don't drop/lose pin . links , it fool-proof - it arrow engraved back links , showing you which side pin/insert comes out . stick nail/whatever into small oval hole pry pin out side . pull it out pair pliers ( it there pretty tight ) you then remove link	1
this ring just what i expected . it fun puzzling , it looks nice . i figured it out after 20 minutes messing it(i've always good puzzles , so it might take someone else longer )	1
i loved wiccan protection knot pendant , i purchased it my daughter christmas she hasn't taked it off since . she wanted celtic tricetta necklace , but absolutely adored this one just much . thank you	1
this bracelet looks better than picture . it looks beautiful my wrist . fifty bucks i paid it real bargain . i love it . there only one drawback , it 8 inches long that too long my wrist . if it fit perfectly , i'd give it ten stars . i'll pay make it smaller . it made titanium , maybe it too tough alter . i want it fit over knot my wrist . if i get it altered , i'll wear it until day i die , which i hope 100 years now	1

this invicta really nice watch but some problems : all metal surfaces polished this watch so they scratch very easily quickly . clock face bit too shiny my opinion ( hard read direct light ) . also , who needs 24h dial chronograph ( instead 1/10s dial) ? but overall this price good deal good looking	1
seller delivering immediately . watch itself sporty but elegant , suited active men	1

these earrings so exceptionally shiny cute . nice size look very well made . couple small drawbacks : pointy edges sunshine rays kind sharp also , hook part seems extra thin because normal small rubber back not fit slide right off but if you wear earrings without rubber back , they slide out you lose them ( i know this because i backtrack grocery store only find my missing earring produce section ! ) . they provide rubber back fits but it so very very tiny i could easily lose it it hard handle fingernails . but don't let those things stop you buying these earrings because they so distinctive attractive . i always get lots compliments when i wear them	1
my husband loves this watch . he so excited it looks even better person than picture . soon he shook it , watch exactly what it suppose set itself right time , date , month . he absolutely thrilled it . i thrilled price this company . thanks all around	1

atomic watches highly-accurate quartz watches which synchronized each day time signal broadcast u.s. definitive u.s. atomic clock ft . collins , colorado . thus , all atomic watches always accurate within fraction second any time . since atomic watches adjust automaticaly daylight saving time they convenient well highly accurate . casio makes -- amazon sells -- wide selection styles atomic watches suit various needs tastes , including g-shock watches extra ruggedness solar-powered watches which never need replacement batteries . but all atomic watches , including this budget-priced waveceptor model , equally accurate fraction second all times . if you want numbered-face watch always accurate this model real bargain	1
i am completely satisfied this product . correct time kept it great watch . i many atomic wrist watches this best one ever .	1

this watch great . it full iron man functionality actually looks nicer than geeky casio - unlike prior iron man watches . i probably should gone steel band it could worn out well . it solid construction easy functionality . indiglo could little brighter but i am sure would cost battery life .	1
my daughter loves this earring ' tree ' . it looks great very practical it holds multiple earrings	1

i own 27 various expensive brands quartz watches finally decided it time invest automatic . i knew stories other people who own them claim it important good watch winder , so , i saw this one decided i'd give it try . i could not see point spending hundreds dollars winder when i could use money towards watch ! :) i ordered this before i even received my new invicta automatic pro diver watch . i very tiny wrists , because , first i not think spring loader going work me . i struggled bit fit my watch holder but after 15 minutes , i got it . i using watch winder off now over week i think it great job . my automatic only 1 minute fast , although i'm not sure if speaks more quality watch or winder , all i say i think product doing what it supposed watch keeping time well . i put it winder each night before bed . it fairly quiet but just my opinion . i read other reviews where people said it loud . i expected it louder than it . like other reviewers , i am unsure how much " too much " winding . i think most watches built mechanism prevents overwinding so i guess putting it winder each night ok . my only problem now lonely empty space where automatic needs since it double winder . hmmmm ...... time get watch ! :) if you need winder , get this . it works well you save extra money get yourself watch add your collection	1
i purchased this gift certificate myself . price you not complain too much- this necklace nice addition my jewlery box . i suppose more expensive ones may sparkle bit more but this nice piece	1

very beautiful pearls . there visible blemishes , which makes them appropriate wear work without me feeling overdressed . uniformity very good . all pearls more or less same size . beautiful clasps too . however i agree previous reviewer it hard handle without help , especially bracelet . took me 10 minutes put it my wrist . color slightly yellowish . shape good : kinda semiround rather than potato . they'll make great gifts .	1
i needed basic watch time running this fits both well	1

i've read all reviews . i too own this model . it what it designed . burlwood much more .... overpriced ? people sometimes need taken hand . especially overpriveleged . you don't know what it like rich untill you've poor . ... you don't know how good your winder till ' you find proper direction . all things , others not going it you all time . but this case i'll make exception . some watches wind both directions ... you know - go both ways ? lot .... back winder lesson , some only go one way . find out what way you need go go there !... problem solved ( help me .. this isn't working ... oh , please ! ) moral too this story " plastic world try not always wood !! god gave you brain . read my revie	1

i am college student member army reserve knowledge manufacturing/production processes . i value pieces fine engineering , precision design . i always admired automatic watches , someday when i afford one i purchase omega or rolex . i tell my particular watch there minute dust hour hand pendulum . first off , this watch should appreciated what it , automatic watch reasonable price . there no batteries , no electronics , just gears springs . some automatic/kinetic/whatever watches use pendulum charge small battery , these not interest me . pros : automatic movement , sharp visual appeal , day/date function , supposed shock resistance ( haven't beat it up enough know if this true but i trust claim researched manufacturing movement ) . see-thru case back so you watch mechanism its thing ! cons : it not rolex , so don't expect perfection . band case solid but lack heft , fit finish rolex level watch . bottom line : if you want truly automatic watch 100 bucks this great choice . orient watches other invicta models supposedly just good . you get compliments this watch	1
i read reviews these earrings i am very pleased results . i purchased my own pair get plenty compliments too	1
i bought this pair earrings myself over year ago ... when they new amazon ( no reviews ) . i wanted something looked pretty but didn't cost me lot . i loved them .... loved them so much when i lost one down my sink drain , i wanted buy pair . i am currently waiting receive my second pair . price beauty , why not ! no one know they aren't real diamonds	1

this watch exactly what i looking . it small , pretty , functional watch quite durable . it plenty features , but not extremely complicated . color slightly lighter more purpley then it pictures	1
this watch arrived very quickly , it very fine watch . i earlier casio ceptor watch battery died , i couldn't find anyone replace it so i needed new watch . time i ordered this watch , i actually replaced battery myself old one . so now i two atomic watches , but g-shock superior far ruggedly sturdy should last indefinately solar power , just sure get it full charge putting it direct sunlight until it indicates full charge . great deal	1
i never problem mine , i'm marine fact i went trough combat mine held up made it worth few bucks i paid it . i go trough watches like they made paper , this one 2.5 yrs other than lot scratches it works fine	1

excellent watch ( eco-drive ) i would spend extra hundred purchase titanium	1
it small beautifull , sure you want small one	1
i purchsed this watch while ago i say it simply great . animated feature simply face switching red black which set hold either color , which feature i found very fuctional it allows me switch color better complitments what i am wearing . i this watch nearly year it still gets comlpiments weekly . my only criticism comes fact it not like some more trend watches wide band actually cuff around entire wrist , which this watch takes its styling cues . nevertheless , it still great watch looks good	1
this watch looks so sleek it wears well day/evening wear . addition it makes great travel watch . i love feel nice soft leather band	1
i very much like these earrings . my only reason not giving them 5-star rating topaz quite small . you really look closely see it . but , they excellent quality sterling silver still beautiful . i recommend them , just aware stones tiny	1
my reaction quite similar other reviewer . i received my watch few weeks ago ( only took three days ) impressed its classy look --- all my other casios basic black clunkers . i like toggle switches protrude , so it easy activate them --- those old recessed ones drove me crazy trying get nail or golf tee there . it all features i wanted , but i same reaction alarm . it less assertive than other casios i've , i don't think i trust it wake me up early or if i'm tired . i've already decided buy inexpensive alarm put my bed . because screen showing digital data small , it not always easy read what it , especially if watch hand partially obscuring screen , which somehow seems happen lot . back light only goes one second time , isn't very strong , so there good chance you won't able read digital screen quickly . fyi , 10 year battery claim based using one second backlight each day , so you better look quick look sharp ---- but not often . so ....... great looks , but personality could better . that life	1

30 reviews before mine gave pretty complete description watch . i'll just say it fits very well my relatively small wrist . if you like watch but think it won't fit well because you small wrist . don't worry , it fits just fine . enjoy . after wearing this watch few weeks , i realized i am just like many others , wearing calibre 2100 exclusively now .	1
i got this watch some couple months ago absolutely loved it . it looks , feels functions really good got lots positive comments my peeps . now reason i cant get give it 5-star ( i really wish i could ); it not perpetual calender . i looking watch all 2100 qualities also perpetual calender . i hate fact i manually adjust my watch painfull enuf , i leave this flaw . if you dont mind watch without perpetual calender then you would love this watch literally bite finger off anyone puts their finger it but i want watch perpetual calender this doesnt not fully cut it me .	1
this watch beautiful . i cannot say enough good things this watchs design . its 45mm face bigger than most watches but doesnt look gawdy , it keeps perfect time very light weight . i bought calibre 8700 before this one i love both them but i would give this one slight edge . my two small complaints this watch doesnt perpetual calender which very nice feature calibre 8700 , also this watch uses mineral crystal face not saphire . i am sure crystal used scratch resistant but it no where near resistant saphire crystal would	1

this 4th or 5th watch this series i've owned . this one allows multiple interval timing . fantastic ! i ' ' chicago marathon this past fall . group i train runs 3 minutes then walks 2 minutes all our training runs . this watch alternates these intervals , sounding alarm after each ! buttons intuitive , making it easy use even quite few features . silver black color combo held up much better black metallic green timex watch line ( metallic green watch face scraped off ) . band openings which nice ( your wrist doesn't get sweaty ) . good value	1

this best watch if you consider following things : 1 . looks : color dial feeling dial hands really beautiful . 2 . size thickness : if you search slim watches , skagen your first final choice . 3 . mesh band : this type band speciality skagen . its un-comparable . 4 . price : considering price overall quality this watch really affordable . bottom line : everyone notice appreciate it .	1

i purchased this bulova watch christmans gift myself , this past christmas ' 06 . i small watch collection i hadn't really bought such elegant watch before , so i decided why not ? specially when i researched price how much i would save buying it amazon . looking pics amazon it looked so nice , but when i received it most beautiful watch i seen or owned . diamond bezel just right it isn't much glitz nor it too little , diamonds just right amazing they sparkle so beautifully against chronograph face stainless steel band . watch itself little heavy compared other watches i own so it definitely sturdy above all just well made timepiece i am sure , not just my collection but my wrist years come .	1
i am very please this purchase . earrings very good quality !	1
let me just say my girlfriend loved them then loved	1
beautiful . wear them all time . sincerely , gai	1
bought this watch my wife , she likes it . " + " + stylish expensive-looking+ stainless steel case bracelet+ date " -"- not too good small hand . though it possible adjust bracelet different sizes , small hand there long part band left ( under " top layer " ) . it difficult make this part invisible , it tends come one sides . - clasp tight . hope it easier open close after some usage . - combination brushed metal dial golden hands makes it difficult read , especially dim light . - golden " piece " actually just thin film layer inner side glass .	1
i love this bracelet . it very pretty looks just like it shown . looks expensive tasteful . i bigger wrists , so i'd like it better if it came larger sizes .. but it goes great my watch	1
we sent this necklace our daughter . it arrived actually earlier than anticipated she just loves it . what great company deal wit	1
i selected this stopwatch many others simply because it indiglo feature , i need operate subdued lighting . other advertised features similar many other stopwatches . use , i found it quite satisfactory . readout clear large enough read glance . i not need explore all features , but it all i would like it quite well . there short learning curve , but not insurmountable . if night vision issue , this only one .... if night vision may requirement future , it still only one . otherwise , it performs least equally well any others available .	1
i bought this memento brilliant but modest necklace i seen smithsonian institute . i love grand central stone well modern multi-strands this design - this combination truly illuminates my evening wear . far , intricate detail present reminds me jewelery owned ladies royal court . so much class it still affordable . this necklace exceptional gem .	1
real earrings look much better than picture . substantial presence nice quality jewellery	1
overall , this watch good : large numbers fairly standard set basic features ( date , alarm , stop watch ) crown seems fairly resistant scratching indiglo lighting greatcontrary description , however , chronograph not lap capability ; it only split function ( 2 way ) . reminder , it not countdown timer , which seems common theme many timex watches	1
swarovski making crystal jewelry since 1892 , their consistent quality kept company going through wars rise fall empires . these excellent earrings made sterling silver swarovski crystals , quite attractive . if you looking some nice , crystal silver earrings , then these ones get . way , they look great when combined heart , star starburst crystal tattoos - which i also highly recommend !	1
bought this use work since i send one i usually wear repairs . lumi extremely bright when charged . monster gained 1 minute 2 days which not bad inexpensive seiko . swapped band nato , fits little bit better my wrist . overall good purchase	1
these earrings beautiful deep blue genuine sapphires 1.0 carat size just right size ( anything larger might tend look " fake " . i've purchased this merchant many , many times always find myself typing * sabrina silver * whenever i need or want new inexpensive piece jewelry ... they're best i've never disappointed .	1

when i recevied my watch , i so excited ! it looked so cool picture ever so when i got it . harry face it neat case comes wit it so detailed ! can't wait 2 sport it when movie last final book arrives !!!	1
i love knowing exact time ( even if my mom thinks i am crazy ) , it works like ... clock ! i never issues updates ( illinois ) , but i few minor issues : watch too thick ( 5/8 inch ) , band made gorilla very difficult adjust human , buttons hard press , manual too small hard read . still , if i choice this watch or my borhter rolex , i take his rolex exchange it 40 casios . thank you , casio	1
great deal gift . if you want something different good price .	1
i wear this watch every day i usually work outside . i am very pleased features durability . it seemed daunting work features forst , but short time instruction book made them accessable easy . i only two complaints : one metal band developed slight " squeak " when i move my wrist sometimes . tin man needs oil . second despite placed huge window every night , watch not always get time signal ft . collins . i gone long several days without getting it - but when you consider most watches not get it all , i am ok spotty reception	1
strap/links these g-shocks quite oversized : when i first got it , i could fit watch around my legs ! ( you'll most likely get links adjusted ) . ironically , four side buttons watch small . so even if you huge wrist , you'll probably trouble pressing buttons ! ( not huge fingers ) *** beware *** picture shows four side buttons watch silver , but left right side buttons this model actually plain black ! it quite misleading ! silver side button actually mtg920dj model ( which 2005 version ) . according casio , mtg920da actually released 2004 black side buttons . if you search casio website , it only display mtg920dj ( their most recent version ); most websites still sell mtg920da just taking latest mtg920dj version picture casio website . mtg920dj seems same features this one ( mtg920da ) , except four side ( left right ) buttons silver . those you wondering three circles watch : first one very left basically wannabe-analog display - basically , every five minutes , bar increases ( or decreases when it gets full ); it just mostly there cosmetic reasons . second one middle battery status ; it ( low ) , ( medium ) , ( high ) bar would display one those areas . if you get out sun lot or know area your home where sun shines lot , then you won't problem battery ever going below high . moreover , it power saving feature ; watch go into sleep mode ( display off ) when it completely dark area long time . finally , third circle very right where it tells you what options enabled/disabled . it shows spl ( split time stopwatch ) , dst ( daylight saving time ) , sig ( hourly signal ) , alm ( alarm ) , snz ( snooze ) , auto el ( automatic electro-luminescent backlight - backlight turns tilting it certain degree towards your face without manually press backlight button . ) keep mind , synchronizing atomic signal not instant : it usually takes around 3 minutes ( least me , i live california . ) if you're busy area or near electronic , it might difficult ; try again or move different area . moreover , it should show you strength/level ( 4 levels ) signal ( while you're synchronizing ) satellite icon watch . there also feature automatically synchornizes you while you're sleeping 2:00 am , 3:00 am , 4:00 am , 5:00 am . therefore , it not always necessary syncronize it yourself because time you wake up , it should ready go . overall , this watch attractive fun wear . atomic radio signal feature very cool ; official time great - right precise second ! i've this watch months now , i enjoy wearing it daily . this watch lot feature - except , it pity it *** not *** countdown timer ! pros : - cool design - water/scratch resistant ; g-shock known their toughest watches . ( update : i've worn this watch daily almost year half now not single scratch - still looks brand new ! )- solar power ; battery life excellent ; never power ever go below high . power saving feature . - position time date easy read one glance . - metal strap - display world time local time cons : - side buttons small tight press ( must use like very tip fingers ) - atomic signal takes too long manually , it usually not possible synchronize while wearing watch ; if you're inside home , it usually best take off watch leave it near window . - alarm beep little longer perhaps ( even my inexpensive timex watch would beep it would gradually beep faster , which i actually like bit better . ) - no countdown timer . ( how could they forget this ?! ) also , try research other models instead finding out hard way ( like i side buttons ) before purchasing .	1
i recently purchased this product christmas gift someone very close me . needless say recipient simply loved it . i recommend this article everyone without hesitatation	1
when i ordered these , i little nervous . however , once i recieved them i rather impressed ! these perfect small ears i love how backs earrings screw-ons they not dig into ear or behind ear ( which problem i run into my daughter who 5 ) . she loves these earrings ! picture amazon horrible , these quite pretty nice . i would definately order more !	1

i thought 7mm might too big but they just perfect size . i haven't taken them off since i got them . great price	1
i looking money clip thin light . i wanted hinge so i didn't bend it every time thickness my wad cash changed significant percentage . i dislike gaudiness much cheesy or cheap appearance . this money clip meets exceeds all i asked , except it looks bit cheap , others commented . it also scratches easily , but i knew this prior purchase decision since i've owned other titanium products . i would given this solid 5 stars if manufacturer made it wider using thicker material rounded corners evenly , but i'm not sure if i would paid higher price . those you who using your finger nails open hinge , i recommend you hold bills open hinge . you leverage open it easily without risking cut . yes , it sharp .	1
several years ago , i given one those so-called front pocket wallets gift . it clip exact same mechanism this clip riveted it . i loved clip , didn't like wallet . too bulky my front pocket . so i ripped clip off wallet . i loved clip until it broke after 4 years everyday use . anyway , searching replacement i found i could spend around 20 bucks front pocket wallet rip clip off it again or i could spend around 20 bucks this clip . i love this clip . its extremely lightweight , strong durable . it keeps my cash neatly organized doesn't pull my pants down . my only complaint corners tad pointy . manufacturer would well soften them bit	1
i purchased these earrings first birthday gift my daughter . we printed out page went local fred meyer jewelers mall see earrings first hand before we purchased . we absolutely loved earrings , however they full price , so decided save $80 purchase them online . they arrived within two days ordering , but when we opened box , diamonds yellow , not clear sparkly pictured site , or mall . still lovely , good price , but i think thast these seconds or lower quality than earrings one purchase physical store	1
i truly expecting something small lightweight arrive . not so ! this piece large , heavy weight very durable ! well worth money	1
it only friendship ying yang necklace i could find anywhere . it perfect , exactly what i envisioned . fast shipping . shipping bit expensive , though , considering price item , but because item itself reasonably priced , i got over it . other problem i shipping , i don't know if it merchant , or amazon , it indicated number days standard shipping would get it me well before christmas , but when i clicked standard shipping it gave me notice i wouldn't get it before christmas i choose expedited order get it christmas . not make me happy .	1

got this christmas , son who growing so fast his wrists haven't caught up his height yet . every watch without buckle just falls off his hands , so strap high priority . this casio actual leather band ( doesn't pinch , doesn't stick , doesn't look tacky ) very sturdy buckle . it also incredibly sturdy well made , dignified stainless steel bezel . my other priority find self-setting watch attractive dial ; this one clear , clean , easy read , beautifully executed glows dark ( all blue back-lighting world won't replace amazing look pale , phosphorescent watch hands floating darkness ) . *** bonus--don't miss watching hands spin when it sets itself first time . absolutely captivated my son -- he loves this thing !!	1

i recieved this watch gift several months ago . watch very nice looking , much better looking person . mine hasn't any issues timekeeping , it very accurate . i haven't experienced problems others . face watch nearly impossible scratch . there several times where i've accidently rubbed face against wall or other surface only find no damage , much my surprise . other watches i've scratch within first week . i've this watch 6 months no face scratches ( although around face band show many scratches , not nearly annoying scratch right face ) . i'm serious , i like party face still scratchless . this very surprising me . chronograph functions almost entirely useless , but who cares . stopwatch without fractions second not worth using , but this watch features more looks , they look great . i don't find this big deal since i would rather not digital functions my watch , they look tacky my opinion . also my cell phone great stop watch funtion which i use 12 ounce beer chug time trials making this complaint almost inconsiquential . movement watch leaves little desired . japaneese movement somewhat jumpy . this price you really can't expect automatic movement however . this really biggest weak point watch if you bunch cash burning hole your pocket , maybe you should get swiss automatic movement watch . this somewhat minor issue given almost all watches this price range use japanees movements no normal person ever know difference . this watch same price cheap fossil watch but when you see it person it feels looks much more expensive . fit finish much more than you would expect $115 . i find it great value . box it comes so nice you don't want throw it away , i still mine . i wear this watch every day i still recieve compliments it	1
i bought watch ball 7-year-old boy . he told me he wearing it every day . i think he likes it .	1

this my first watch purchase online store . watch brand new unscathed . i links removed , but it easy free process my local walmart . it fairly scratch resistent indiglo date features great	1
i wanted i watch i could forget i wearing . this watch fits bill . it very very light weight , band comfortable . i've multiple watches over course my life , but this one i put start day only take off end day , comfortable light . it also looks great . sophisticated looking , worn both casual dress events . great everyday watch ! highly recommended	1
my husband loves fossil watches , got this one his birthday not disappointed . looks nice , worn everyday or nice evening out	1
i mine two days now . it what i expected : lightweight , minimalist , stylish watch . mine quiet , i hear it ticking only when held tight my ear . clasp takes some getting used instruction could clearer , but once one gets it figured out it works fine , including adjusting it . it somewhat difficult read low light , but hands while small very reflective so changing viewing angle bit usually bring them into clear view .	1
i agree most other posters here watch aesthetics-it really sleek watch goes well casual or more formal clothing . i'm writing review mainly address " loud clicking " some people seem experiencing . it really quiet watch i can't hear it totally quiet room-except when i hold it particular position . if you wear your watch your arm face back your hand then point ceiling , it'll sometimes make clicking noise surprisingly loud . it odd position though it only very particular position , so it doesn't all detract my overall impression this watch . edit : i've spent more time this watch i must say it looks awesome everything jeans suit . thing i'd add it only " noisy " when watch face isn't contact anything- e.g. when you it upside down your wrist there gap , or when you leave it sideways table . some positions it actually get quite loud , but i never maintain one those long enough figure out how replicate it	1
beautiful watch . it little heavy compared your other watches since its all stainless steel . your basic functions including alarm , date , 24h time , stop watch . it also night blue backlight . its little bigger then picture would make it seem	1

i , too , am disappointed misinformation amazon originally posted regards watch solar-powered , but even without feature it still great watch . now , those you who whining not able adjust metal band this wonderful watch , it very easy . if you look inside band , some links small arrow stamped them . just put very small screwdriver into one holes " arrow " side one those links push . same next " arrow " link . remove both pins loose link . ( course , you may remove more than one link ! ) then connect band back together slide one pins into " non-arrow " side secure it . make sure slotted/pinched side pin goes last . push pin slightly match other links . hope this helps you appreciate this great watch little more	1

this my first time purchased amazon . product i purchased what i expected . however , i must say amazon extremely needs improve customer service organizational skill . watch i purchased not include any sale receipt . there no warranty information included . most all , no instruction manual came watch . box watch torn ripped apart . this not mention i defective watch shipped me before . obviously i overrated amazon before my purchase . after this experience , i felt though i made purchase on-line through " mom pop " business versus fortune 500 company . i don't think it would take rocket scientist figure out if i make any future purchase amazon	1

i can't give it 5 stars , it not perfect . i lot watch tools , this nice one . case nice , it works it should . but , again , it not perfect . pins don't stay , making it harder use ( you use it upside down , pins don't lock ) . there should instructions those who don't know exactly how use it . little half-sheet included all but useless . but it great deal price . easily opens notch-back cases i use it	1
i bought these my girls so they watch all times when they go park . they ages 8 9 . these worked out great i plenty replace lost watches .	1
i removed links my new seiko band . no problem . i see how doofus might need extra parts , while they learning proper technique . press down firmly band your thumb prevent it moving while you turn knob your other hand . base under band spring-loaded strong spring . if you allow band move while you pushing pin out , you may break off part that doing pushing . get band pin lined up exactly before proceeding - or - you may break little pusher part . good luck - it good tool .	1
i recieved this today i say i'm very pleased . it nice victorian gothic look it . it go perfect chain i	1
i am impressed how easy this machine use . directions straight forward , machine ready use almost immediately after plugging it . some reviewers said this huge machine , but i didn't think it big all . it cleaned my diamond rings other jewelry really well . it even shined my gold bands become quite dull ( i didn't even notice how dull they until jewel jet made them shiny again i trying clean diamond my ring ) . overall , i think this great product , i enjoy fact i no longer take my jewelry anywhere cleaned .	1

i think pendant nice , although it bit delicate kids	1
first thing note timex web site claims three-year battery life , while amazon claims eight years . i hope amazon right , but you should know what manufacturer thinks ;) my wife chose this watch because its looks , i must admit it looks rather nice . this definately no-frills . no compass , no alarm , no stopwatch . but it tells time date . besides looking sharp , my favorite thing size/weight -- it rather thin light . i wanted watch more features , but i could not stand thought something larger heavier . there really not much complain . date display rather small . band also advertised " water resistant leather " but i would not want take it swimming . only time tell how it hold up . i also not know why watch manufacturers continue use cheap zinc glow powder hands . newer strontium-based powders available still glow great after eight hours . oh well , all manufacturers this , it light up entire face so glow powder really not even needed . so , summarize , it small light metal men watch , it looks great . guys , one look this ladies know you man who comfortable deep woods	1
this one very first pieces celtic jewelry i purchased . i am extremely pleased quality detail this pendant , many comments it . very nice piece !!!	1

my sister loved this neckalace . i thought pendant would little smaller , but overall still pretty	1
i shopping new watch , i certain number criteria mind . 1 . it must affordable2 . it must recognized brand ( quality purposes)3 . it must stylish without too fad-ish4 . it must multi-purpose lend itself almost all styles dress , it casual or formal . i found all this this little seiko watch . first , i setting my sights no-battery type design , but after reading both kinetic solar watches ... finding out both require replacement either lithium ion battery or capacitor , neither which guaranteed last longer than regular battery operated watch ... i decided stick regular quartz . watch itself looks better than its picture . dial listed white website , but it actually silver tone ... similar what you see rolex brands ( which it supposed mimic ) . gold nice shine it , particular sparkle coming marked hours pie-cut bezel around watch face . there luminous material watch hands hour markers , but very minimal amount . my guess they didn't want detract shiny finish , but you lose some ability see watch face night . there enough see watch hands ... just barely ... but hours really hard make out dark . oh well , if checking time night real issue then i suggest looking some timex indiglos . *** revision *** while it hard see luminous hands markers first , they get brighter once your eyes adjust dark . i found myself waking up early this morning could clearly see all marked hours hands my watch face no problems . this watch also comes day date calendar . some said it hard work , but i actually found it really easy . instructions very easy follow i calendar time set up 2 minutes . this watch surprisingly lightweight very comfortable wear . catch opens without breaking any nails off band very roomy . i medium large sized wrist wear my watch slightly loose " bracelet " style , but i still get couple links taken out . my verdict : good watch good price . it goes everything my closet company that known excellence durablility . five stars	1
i not own this version , but invicta , well other watches screw down crowns . what this means you cannot pull out crown without unscrewing it , which counter clockwise . it then pop out . then you push crown screw it clockwise gentle inward pressure screw it down . there some discussion proper care while using crown web . apparently this area where you greatest potential damage your watch , any watch . so gentle , especially when setting time , date , etc . most watches you shouldn't this near midnight . perhaps search web . invicta instruction booklets completely generic , so it not surprising some people might confused	1
only reason i rated this 4 stars you can't really see hour minute hands dark . i know description says hands luminescent but they really aren't . other than , watch looks great - right balance sporty class	1
i bought these my twenty-something sister-in-law ... she loved them put them right away . they small , so aware ; she tiny delicate features , usually only wears stud earrings , so they perfect her . these would too small someone who usually wears larger or flashier earrings . there bit space stones metal doesn't really show pictures , but it nothing you notice once they . all , great value	1
i received this gift find necklace absolutely georgous ! goes everything i get lots compliments . i wish they earrings match !!! i don't know what moonstone but it really pretty .	1
i love them they small enough everyday wear , people coment them often how they like smaller size how they nice shine them . i also usally problems my ears hurting or getting sore after wearing some earring but not these this type metal defently worth price	1
several days research came this conclusion ... watch i looking , i would pay somewhere around $1000 up or i could get seiko . it " no brainer " me leas t.t itanium only thing missing my list perfect watch . owning seiko titanium kinetic ( 10 yrs . ) , i tell you importance sapphire crystal . band wore down before face ( i tend little rough watches . )	1

fine looking , elegant , " sporty " watch , very light comfortable . my only complaint sub-dials - numbers/letters so tiny just useless , especially date dial , 31 numbers crowded . said , though - i like it lot , i wear it lot . my recommendation : check out any watch " live person " before you buy it online .	1

i am extremely impressed feel , look general quality watch . it contains citizen miyota 21 jewel automatic movement true workhorse fraction price . comfortable stainess steel pinned link bracelet worth price watch . it rounded flexible brushed steel wrist links foldover adjustable double safety clasp uses pins well . easily mistaken watch costing much more . mineral glass crystal scratch resistant - but not good sapphire watch face , but less prone chipping or shattering than sapphire crystal . display watchback also mineral glass - displaying undecorated miyota automatic movement . it look stylish run well my other watches , , i receive many comments if not more invicta . it great looking watch ! good value , accurate stylish if you like sub ' look . this good day-to-day knock watch still looks better than quartz stuff same price range . if it lasts 5 years it more than paid itself . if you would like more information talk others invicta or other watches visit www.thewatchcentral.com . all questions comments responded	1

great watch trainnig specially running since very light easy use . unfortunatelly 3rd one ( yes 2 mine 1 my son ) lets watter while pool/beach ( light swiming or playing kids ) . it seems like it not watter ressitant . first one i tought it " bad luck " , but after 3 ... i still think best one outhere actually just order 2 more replace recent cassualties ( my son myself ) , but it would nice if you tell timex " correct " their insulation problem . thank you , fc	1
it get 4 stars because , well what would you expect , slide rule accurate 2 decimal places . it could given you 3 . oh well . if you using your watch calculate your arrival time you probably don't really care if you off few minutes . ok , why circular slide rule cool ? first , lots common calculations really just ratios . kilometers miles or statue miles nautical miles , pounds kilograms . this watch markers slide rule , so you just align one mark number you want convert look number other unit measure over there you . you keep track magnitude answer but that not hard . you sq roots but it pain . basic multiplication division easy . doing approximation tip restraunt , just set percentage over " 10 " mark , look you bill inside ring , read tip outside ring . no need even adjust watch . you easily set it up before dinner . note : if you stare your watch while trying read tip value , you may get called " rude " your date ! better just overestimate ... downside , if you not perfect vision , you'll hard time reading sliderule . don't even think doing this while you driving . my eyes fine it good light . other hand , time hands numerals plenty large enough easy read . luminescent marks seem stay bright hour , which good enough us casual night hawks . otherwise you need watch tritium who knows whether pass airport security these days . one other thing 24 hr inner hand easily obscured main watch hands . so this feature not very handy second timezone clock . it help you remember military time , but say 11:00 you can't see underlying hand . not big thing , i suppose if you set say 8 or 9 hours difference it might more visible . all all , cool watch , even if slide rule control built lefty	1

this watch quite nice makes fashion statement any arm . however , band leaves little bit desired . while it attractive band , it not functional expected . it not wrap around arm securely without turning bit sideways showing bit end band . while this not severe problem , it not 100% acceptable	1
there alot complaints amazon similar pieces . it very small but no smaller than 14mm add states . i like it small because cameos tend bit gawdy . i not get one diamonds , just plain silver my mother gift valentine day . agate slightly raised setting but not appear problem , design intricate nice . ring pendant could little stronger but i think it ok . chain very nice strong . it arrived time i live japan . we love everything angels them , we even pet or mutt named angel . :-) i paid $34.00 plus $5.00 shipping handling i am ok	1
... price , i loved ' em too . great surprise gift . hopefully , they'll hold up over time	1

originally written orange monster , this review holds equally true black version . moment you first hold this watch your hand , you realize it quality timepiece . first thing strikes you its large size heavy feel , yet despite , it feels comfortable wrist due its fine balance . bracelet : bracelet end links ( those attach watch case ) solid rather than formed sheet metal like you find most other watches this price range . pins holding bracelet watch sturdiest i ever seen . each bracelet subsequent links also made solid piece steel , not folded sheet , each component feather-edged prevent it digging into wrist . its removable link pins unusual machined pin collar design which , though fiddly remove replace , nevertheless ensure pins remain under-flush secure when correctly installed . bracelet perfectly flush side contacts your wrist making it feel very smooth during wear . clasp very high quality , both fold over security buckle , which deploys satisfying click , omega style double button catch . security buckle closes onto spring pin whose ends spherical thus ensuring tight fastening which should not wear use . all all these features add up watch very quiet wrist , only faint sound coming its automatic winding mechanism . finally bracelet incorporates clever hidden diver extension ( allow watch worn over wet suit ) . case : watch case , back bezel made stainless steel . case attractive mix polished , brushed machined finishes which all add feel quality function . overall impression this precision instrument rather than fashion piece ; that not say though it would look out place dinner jacket any more than wet sui t.t he unidirectional bezel heavily scalloped design , protected bezel-guards which extend upwards each lug pairs . lower guard also functions crown guard , all all , impression case machined solid billet steel . bezel sits slightly higher than domed crystal , thus providing protection scratching crystal itself proprietary seiko material " hardlex " which , i understand it , better resisting scratches than mineral glass but less susceptible shattering than sapphire . luminosity this watch astounding due partly use seiko proprietary " lumibrite " paint but also large coated areas hour markers hands . bezel only turns one way , safety feature timing dives , feels silky smooth , best i've experienced any seiko or invicta diver . it 120 clicks per revolution nicely aligned face . movement : watch uses 21 jewel seiko 7s26 movement running 21,600 bph ( 5 ticks per second ) . it non-hacking which means second hand not stop when crown pulled out . although this makes it difficult synchronize , if slight backward pressure applied fully extended crown , it possible stop second hand . watch not hand wound but self winding mechanism very efficient i found it power reserve least 24 hours . 7s26 around many years reputation ruggedness reliability . accuracy : there several reviews where people complain poor accuracy . typically , when new , automatic movements set run fast factory because they tend slow down after few weeks use . i own three watches 7s26 movement after their breaking period all now keeping time within 10 seconds per day . i few thoughts accuracy . you ask yourself how accurate your watch need ? if it running 10 or 20 seconds fast per day then set it one minute slow you only need re-set it once every week or two when it advanced one minute fast . if you need more accuracy then , unless you willing pay least five times much swiss watch , then buy quartz . finally , if you search seiko monster you'll quickly come realize its various colours , these watches firm favourites amongst those who members internet watch forums . i would highly recommend you purchase one see yourself	1
i ordered 3 pairs 1 carat earrings i absoulutely loved them . price outstanding well . i am sure i continue business there	1
really nice ring , it really good good pric	1
this pendant very pretty , but it not quite what i expected . dimensions given 3/4 inch high wide , but i picturing it bit larger . i also thought chain would more robust , but it very fine . it packaged cheap felt bag inside cardboard box . these not bad things , i like necklace , but i thought i'd put down my misconceptions help others make decision . overall product seems very good quality	1
