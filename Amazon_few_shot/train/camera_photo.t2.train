this bag very small . my canon 20d fits nicely small lens , but you cannot fit more than one lens camera body . we kept bag informal use when we only need body one lens avoid always carry bulky bag	1
when i received camera i thought giving it 5 star because good looking nice picture . after 6 months use , i wish i could give it 0 star . it true it looks good but it very hard hold camera . it droped twice when i took pictures . also lens too small . dirt very easy get onto lens very hard clean b/c it small . thanks dirty lens , picture quality worse than ever . battery very small too . after 6 months use , it not hold enought power shoot 10 pictures ! they put buttons here there fit small space . it not user friendly camera .	-1

polarizing filters used eliminate glare non-metallic surfaces like glass or water . they also used increase contrast color saturation your image . i use my polarizer not only eliminate glare , but also make skies nice shade blue or get some " pop " out clouds . there so many options consider when purchasing polarizing filter your needs . instance , linear vs . circular , film or digital versions , or quality vs . price . if you making use ttl or auto-focusing system , circular polarizers designed work those features . linear polarizers their uses , but they manufactured differently may not work . unless you certain , just get circular polarizing filter . there some digital circular polarizers market . i am not sure what makes cir-pl lens better digital opposed film . i use canon 20d digital slr see no problems caused using supposed non-digital filter digital camera . most time , when it comes filters ; you get what you pay . mean you need expensive polarizer ? course not , just sure get right filter your needs . what ever polarizing filter you get , make sure it color neutral prevent unwanted tinting . spending more color balanced filter save time post . if you need multiple filter sizes , consider saving money using step down rings . currently i use hoya pro1 filters , canon polarizing filters i previously owned without question bulkier heavier . weight might not seem like much , but when you stick all your items backpack all extra bits weight add up quickly . i spend good amount time my equipment my back so this big concern me . when it came down images , times i would see browning tint my photos . tint easy clean up photoshop cs2 , but i don't see problem hoya pro1 filter . overall , i would recommend against canon polarizing filters . i originally thought , " it canon , it must quality . " since then i replaced all my canon filters . this filter works , but comes cost disadvantages other similarly priced filters . pros : used film or digital cameras eliminates internal reflections ghosting cons : bulky heavynot neutral color balance	1
description or product wrong . there no quad independent power/charging indicators . they set up banks two . one light two charging bays . batteries must charged banks two . tried e-mailing vidpro additional info this charger . e-mail came back undeliverable . cannot find any reviews internet this charger	1
this camera worked very well until lens got jammed its extended position . i sent camera warranty service ( i it less than 7 months ) , they refused honor warranty because it bit scuffed little decorative ring end lens attached 2-sided tape come off . they claimed this happened due physical damage , but this occurred during normal use : i just changing modes lens didn't retract . don't bother trying get warranty service unless unit looks brand new . even then , don't surprised if they renege warranty . i a410 very same thing ( lens got jammed ) , but stolen break-in before i sent it out service ( so i suppose it no loss after all ) . obviously there design flaw causes lens extend too far come off track inside . short , this camera not suitable frequent use field . if you buy it , plan use it lot , expect buying camera or paying repair should covered under warranty ( which i'm not doing ) soon .	-1

this item either not coated or single coating thus any time sun hits filter , it produces flare picture . furthermore , after doing more research it turns out these uncoated or single coated filters cause up 9% light loss vs multi-coated filters like hoya s-hmc or b+w mrc filters . polarizer effect itself , i think it amazing you owe it yourself least try it nice sunny day .

ok , i imagine if you forked over $900 this baby you would not want me telling you you got bad deal , but i am going say it anyway . this little baby way over priced , not mention you need lot more than just this make it work . you need wireless router !! so rather than just complain , let me tell you what i want canon it maybe we start revolution ! cf cards 12gb range it doesn't make sense you would need this capacity reasons ( i know those you biggest brightes 16mp shoot jpeg raw highest settings just laughed me ) , however where this item worth it if you want immediately see your shots big screen or computer without take shot , take out card , etc . what i want bluetooth compact flash card . they make these so i know it possible . i would like canon offer support these compact flash cards so i immediately sync my bluetooth computer my bluetooth camera . now would make it so when i am studio or shooting wedding , i mobility 30 feet - 90 feet depending card i don't drag wireless router i saved myself $700 . get it canon - i am waiting !!!	-1
like reviewer , my experience mixed . i use this remote d50 . sometimes remote works , then it goes strike . then suddenly it works again . same distance angle camera . i changed battery - same result . i hardly use it anymore because it so unreliable	1
i got it just today used it cleaning my lens . solution might useful , blower useful , swabs useful their pointed tips , but so called " magic cloth " anything but magic . it kept leaving lint my lens	1
yes , i agree previous review . it doesn't seem make any difference reducing lens flare light sources . it doesn't seem extend far enough actually anything . if it less expensive i wouldn't mind much , just chalk it up extra protection . but seems all it good	-1
i love canon products i complete canon system 10 years . i love everything canon . however i not understand canon reasoning behind producing this lens . reason ef-s lenses offering wider angle getting rear elements lens closer " film " plane . they cannot this film full frame sensor cameras because mirror larger would hit rear elements ef-s lens . they indicated , however , 35 mm advantage gone . why then they produce 60 mm macro lens when they already their macro requirements covered they current three lenses ? i would guess short back focus makes lens cheaper ; but this lens only $60 short excellent 100 2.8 usm macro . i said , if $60 i get lens 40 mm more reach ( 66 1.6 crop cameras ; useful macro photography ) works all canon cameras , i'm not going thinking this lens all . granted , you might not thinking buying ff camera anytime soon , but canon indicated eventually they ff all their dslr , so why bother this lens ? 17-85 or 10-22 very reasonable offerings ef-s lineup , but 60mm macro doesn't make any sense me.my $0.0	1
when i opened package , i found filter box seals ( one each side ) broken , indication it not new . i thought it ok long glass clean clear . when i opened filter box , three pieces , ring , glass circular clamp , jumped out . while it bad sign , i still thought it ok long i could put them together . well , glass not clear , if it sanded middle fine sand paper ( i never saw any filter or lens shape before ! ) . before ship it back , i try put three pieces togather ( so next person not see these pieces jump out when open box ) . guess what , circular clamp 2-3mm longer two ends couldn't meet !!! i couldn't image any scenario under which this could happen , since it amazon , not some unknowns ebay ( actually , any ebayer worry feedback ) . i really shocked amazon shipped garbage its customer ! hope this just random incident amazon very easy return practice . otherwise , i would not buy anything amazon	-1

i purchased canon powershot s500 digital elph last march . i kept getting blurry pictures so i called canon technical support . they went through whole procedure make sure my camera all set up . well i followed their directions but everything way it should . so they said i should send it because there obviously problem it . then i sent it pay shipping there . they sent it back said they switched out some optical thing . well i just finally went get my pictures developed they all same problem . they never fixed problem . mind you this approximately 9 months my son life before age 2 . i called tech support ended up wait more than 24 hours call back supervisor . she said they would send me pre paid envelope check out camera . well i greatful tell her during babysitting late august little boy dropped my camera so there damage outside part camera , but it not effect quality pictures because they same prior day it dropped . she said they would probably not cover it due fact it might caused dropped camera . i told i proof when it happened pictures prior date coming blurry just like it before i sent it first time . i started cry my son 9 months all ruined she practically laughing when i got off phone . camera worse than disposable camera . don't waste your time or money this piece junk . i recommend olympus . my olympus prior this only 3 megapixels better quality than this piece junk . i am planning contacting better business bureau regarding this matter . please don't waste your time this , like i ! i hope this helps people make better choices ! good luck ! i wish someone could forecasted this me	-1
i owned several canon digital cameras like them very much . i purchased a520 gift family member . after several months lens cover problem everyone writes started happening . it would stick paritally open or closed or all way open . key word stick or stuck . i took it canon service center they repaired it under warranty . after trying use it 1st time several weeks later lens cover stuck open would not budge . i took it back service center they repaired it again . while looking paperwork after repair they stated courtesy repair only not under warranty . it under warranty 90 days date they not repair it first time . after emailing canon they said just email them if i problem they would see what they could . very poor . i like canon digital cameras but wish i never purchased a520 . i bought it because it low price , which big mistake	-1

i admit i'm far expert digital cameras . i take over 32,000 photographs 35mm cameras over 20 years . i purchased 510 powershot july 2005 . it wasn't too long before zoom cameras lens wouldn't work . i contacted canon over this you believe this company audacity charge me shipping their faulty camera back them . i understand them saying , ' we'll charge you first , but once we establish fault due us , we'll then reimburse you back . ' i enclosed type written letter camera asking canon contact me when they received my camera ( mail ) i also asked they contact me when it shipped back . ( i also emailed them same request ) . neither my wishes ever fulfilled canon behalf . itself enough me i've bitter ever since . i've also told every person i've met who wanted buy digital camera this incident . i'm pleased say , i've steered most away this company . what else i say this camera : this camera slow times after its taken picture . i've missed out some good shots due this . it eats batteries like there no tomorrow so one must rechargeable aa even make this camera worth its while . i've not used other digital cameras so maybe they all this way but if i take 3 minute movie ( this camera ) my home during day go outside , most things outside very white . almost like looking infra red photograph . when filming outside , when one goes inside during day , everything dark . like i said , maybe all digital cameras this way ? i wouldn't recommend this camera or anything canon makes if you want my personal opinion . think . you pay shipping camera that barely few months old still under warranty . that disgusting , that all i say . there should zero this , not 1 star	-1

i deeply dissapointed this lens hood . given cost 10% cost lens which it intended ( 70-300 this case ) i expected it stiff durable polycarbonate . -positives-fulfills basic function lens hood- prevents flare , etc . bayonet locking system excellent , much easier deal than scew-on type lens hoods . that it . -negatives-the polycarbonate so thin i half expect it translucen t.t he hood must gripped base remove it , grippng thin end hood may break it ; or least it feels like it may break it . its very long . especially 70-300 which already long lens , this makes fully extended zoom foot long . that pretty conspicuous . it very overpriced vs . generic lenses ($50 vs . $5-10 rubber or metal ) . i traded it went kalt rubber lens hood . 2 stars great bayonet design , but rest it weak	1
i got this my s70 . first off , order use it , you set s70 " radio control " ( 9 button pushes ) . then you better stay no further away than six feet or so ( only * front * camera-the remote doesn't work rear ! ) . oh , if you want adjust your framing , forget i t-t he zoom immobilized . if you need " cable release , " i strongly suggest simply using self-timer built into camera . it gives you 2-second 10-second settings , you're almost certain steady tripod time .	-1

after three weeks batteries fails . i buy knew one walmart , less expensive	-1
probably very good case , but not very operatable one field - you undo two closures open camera compartment , strap velcro . shoulder strap not detachable - looks kind silly when you trying use belt strap . olympus stylus digital cameras , look lowepro case - better case value	1
if you actually get picture turn out right , it take pretty decent pictures . most time photo either over-exposed or too dark grainy . it also only holds 5 pictures , so you buy memory card if you want really use this alot . i little disapointed it due fact it cost 40 dollars , it doesn't really seem worth it	1
i bought this camera after reading reviews wanted get camera uses different media type other than smartmedia ( which only lasts month ) . i would say i am extremely disappointed , particularly grainy images completely out focus edges . even all settings highest possible quality powershot sd1000 , my old olympus camedia c-2020 takes much better photos . it incredible how blurry edges surprised why no one mentioned it so obvious , especially other reviewer pro photographer . so blurry i use photoshop crop out left right sides . right side worse than left making 1/8th entire image unrecognizable . maybe i simply got one bad lens . any case , no thanks , i'll stick my trusty old camera . i would rather pay new smartmedia card each month .	1
this battery not fit camera i purchased . camera comes battery , so why you try sell me one , one not fit , no less ? i returned battery but not heard back you return . it two weeks	-1
my title says it all - i really disappointed this camera , but before i get into specifics why , i must mention few things first . this my third camera exilim line - prior purchasing z850 i owned z60 , well z600 . both great cameras . i mean , what not like ? clean , sexy look ; easy use ; great picture quality . but work kodak past , i decided i want get more involved world digital photography post processing , order i needed something little more manual control , so i sold my z600 , got z850 instead . big mistake ! i ordered it directly amazon , it brand new camera . right bat i got defective unit ! problem - it very inconsistent taking sharp pictures , especially close-ups . shots blurry most part , colors bit off well . how quality reliability ?! but i thought myself , " it okay , it happens " , so i returned it back amazon ( thanks their great return policy ) , got myself one , this time techtoysforless ( it lot cheaper comparing amazon ) . one thing aware - techtoysforless sells what it called " grey market " cameras . i knew it ahead time , but someone might not , then unpleasantly surprised . those who don't know what it - " grey market " refers flow new goods through distribution channels other than those authorized or intended manufacturer . only new products fall under legal , accepted definition grey market . grey market goods sold outside normal distribution channels companies which may no relationship producer goods . frequently this form parallel import occurs when price item significantly higher one country than . this situation commonly occurs cigarettes electronic equipment , such cameras . entrepreneurs buy product where it available cheaply , often retail but sometimes wholesale , import it legally target market sell it price which provides profit but which below normal market price there . so , product legal , it new , it cheap . but ... some instances , there could minor differences " authorized " product , " grey market " one . example , " grey " z850 doesn't ebay mode , but offers " auction " mode instead . it bit different respect settings . also , there no full blown manual box , but rather short " how " instruction various languages . however , full manual found cd-rom . difference , that actually plus i think , it comes european power adapter , whereas american sold models don't . biggest concern " grey market " products , however , some cases manufacturer refuse honor warranty , so you aware , check before buying . i knew all above , but still took chance , mainly because price difference significant , but also because techtoysforless 10-day return policy , i thought it would enough time me " explore " camera find out whether it defective or not . any case , i placed order , three days later held new z850 my hands . i didn't waste any time , when battery fully charged , i started taking shots left right . all them crisp , clear , sharp , so i knew unit good , lens wasn't defective it previous one i . however , i noticed it right away because i tend take mostly pictures people , colors bit " warm " . what i mean there slight cast " pink " present all pictures . you wouldn't notice it pictures architecture , food , or nature , but people skin tone looked somewhat unnatural , it very obvious . neither z60 , nor z600 problem . i still kept camera though because i could take care it doing some minor editing/post processing . what finally made me gave it up ( i sold it ebay ) , casio ignorance unresponsiveness fact it " broken " movie mode . original firmware , version 1.0 , camera came problem " stair stepping " - movies " jerky " , " noisy " . after numerous complaints customers , casio released two new firmware versions , 1.1 , 1.1 supposedly " fixed " movie issue . but what they fact just " cripple " it - movie angle cut 40% version 1.1 , picture quality actually got worse ! version 1.1 didn't actually fix anything , but rather " improved " already decent picture quality , added support high capacity memory cards . also , i've heard lot people even if those cameras function properly beginning , there big chance they brake later due poor quality . i didn't want wait find out , so i got rid off it . i didn't my usual pros cons type review this case , above comments it might seem like there nothing positive this camera , but it actually few good things . one , addition its big , super-bright display , it viewfinder ! big plus my opinion , especially when shooting outdoors direct sunshine . also , top its numerous preprogrammed best shots , it some manual controls , giving you even more flexibility . it nice little camera . unfortunately , it lacks two important departments - quality reliability . i wish i could say i enjoyed using it , but it more hassle than fun . however , i still stand behind casio products . after i sold z850 , i got myself p700 model , which discontinued some time now , virtually impossible find anywhere . it semi-pro model , offers even more manual controls than z750/z850 models . excellent camera ! true performer ! built like tank , sharp canon lens , made japan change ! ( all other exilim models made china , which could reason poor quality ) i've used p700 couple months , ... sold it :-) yep ... call me crazy , call me whatever you want - i just decided i want even more manual control flexibility , so i got myself panasonic dmc-lx2 . one word - wow ! what camera ! optical image stabilization , wide angle leica lens , raw format just name few many features this truly great little gem camera . i've it only 2 days now , but i'm already love it . don't forget check my review it , which coming shortly . i didn't completely abandon casio though - my present my wife valentine day this year - casio ex-s770 red color . i'm definitely going get my hands it also , so come back review soon . once again , i hope i've provided you some help your camera purchasing decisions . good luck	1
i can't speak how well product performs because mine doa . customer service unable anything over phone . since it purchased gift i time before christmas , i opted different brand . doesn't inspire confidence their quality control when unit fails start up fresh out box	-1
i bought this recharger kit specifically sandisk m230 mp3 player . when i first received kit , i charged all batteries . upon first use i only got 7min . out each battery , when i got 20 hrs . batter sent player . i learned online batteries still their charge , but due battery " memory effect " or " voltage depression , " my player thinks batteries lost their charge after only 7min . if you buying batteries electronic device detects how much " juice " left battery , not buy this kit	-1

i searching reviews nikon coolpix s7c make sure it wasnt just me - i am finding indeed countless other reviewers same problem , many taken it up nikon only told ' sorry ' . nutshell , i am professional photographer owned dozen digital cameras ranging early elph nice new slr models . i purchased nikon coolpix s7c my wife , it far worst one i owned many reasons , but chief problem they simply screwed up way this camera things automatically result horrible pictures . ' electronic vr ' simply digital image sharpening , iso adjustments low light terrible , what i simply cannot believe how terrible autofocus . couple design this camera makes it difficult shoot steadily , you literally end up getting more than 50% blurry pictures	-1
i really don't know how write " helpful " review this camera , i'm not photographer ; all i say i not satisfied my purchase , so ... *** if you're trouble deciding which digital camera get ( like i few months ago ) , save your time effort start looking other cameras . *** here my complaints : flash too strong ( blinding , fact ) . please not take this complaint lightly , flash brighter than you think ( it actually hurts , i'm talking physical pain here ) . i actually fear it might some long term effects , this alone deal-breaker me ! it beyond me how this got past testing stages nikon . sure , you turn flash off . but only brings me my other major complaint ! lighting must almost perfect if you want take semi-decent picture without flash . lens not respond well artificial lighting , all , pictures either come out all grainy ( if it slightly dark ) or huge white patches all over if there lot light background . even when lighting almost perfect , you lose lot quality ( even when using highest settings , 6mp ) . scene modes didn't help much , i tried everything , all different modes offer so little difference , very gimicky my opinion . even if you want endure pain suffering mighty flash , there chance pictures come out somewhat unclear , why ? i no clue what so ever . i might take same exact picture same exact conditions settings minute apart slightly different pose ( but still stable ) , one would blurry while other crystal clear ! must admit though , swivel design very practical makes things so much easier . video mode great well . if you don't mind inflicting serious pain onto yourself others via blinding flash , then i must admit , pictures come out nicely . ( most time	1
this camera great first very easy use , however , condensation error many others seem came true us well . when we first got error it not anywhere near any water or moisture , so we put it our cedar chest ( we keep our house very dry don't live humid area - nebraska ) . this worked few months , but error now permanently camera useless . i wish it different , but bottom line , this disposable video camera - nice one , but still disposable	-1
not worth $10 i paid especially when i spend $7 ship it !!	1
this alright camera . if you're average teen looking post some hot pictures myspace , or just someone looking capture few choice family moments , this camera should serve you fine . what i liked it : 1 . it compact , lightweight easy enough use2 . pictures taken daylight turn out pretty nice3 . battery life this camera much better than other cameras i've usedwhat i disliked it : 1 . it bit flimsy honest2 . attempting take picture afternoon , evening or early morning near impossible without it looking completely washed out or too dark . even though it night landscape option , it doesn't really work . 3 . flash causes horrible delay ( but that mentioned like 9,000 times before)this definitely not camera glamour shots . i'd also strongly discourage buying it if you're thinking using it take pictures music events	1
this frame looks great until you turn it . picture quality less than stellar , but isn't what annoyed me this frame . when you buy this frame don't expect view your photos 16:9 ratio without some work photo manipulation program . what mean you ask ? means your photos won't fill entire screen 4:3 mode . you 2 black bars either side your images ; this not take advantage entire frame . if you switch 16:9 mode your images stretch width frame , making peoples faces distorted . i workaround those who familiar image manipulation . see below . build quality frame pretty good . if mustek would fix 16:9 problem get better quality screen , this would nice little frame . little work evolved setting up pictures 16:9 ratio , but i figured it out . 16:9 stretches image , making it look distorted . these steps compensate stretch make your images appear normal . i set up macro photoshop allowing me batch one click mouse . you just need keep eye out how it crops image . some your images might better served one time . start image 1024x768 your image editing program . 1 . go image size menu change width image 77% ( or 788 pixels ) this make image look distorted . ok . 2 . then go canvas size menu crop height image 77% ( or 591 pixels ) image ready save . you might want save folder so youcan go back your original if needed . 3 . copy your edited images flash card insert into frame	1
doesnt work even though lenmar website says it . i thought it pretty good deal $26 . i wouldnt even give it one star coz it plain doesnt work	-1

i got it sale $88.00 thinking it would great bargain price . i feel i ripped off . video quality ghastly when given enough light , absolutely unusable without . same goes pictures . even highest quality - lot image enhancements , results mediocre . audio portion video very noticeable hum , which i able remove my audio editing software . otherwise , audio recording playback " acceptable , " best . this device useful only audio recorder/mp3 player , not really bargain	-1
picture quality okay , but battery life horrible	1
loved concept this camera ... small , 10x zoom sleek looking , but first one lasted 3 days , it replaced second one lasted 1 week . both stopped operating completely . so given kind problem i not recommend this camera	-1
i several people take my pictures . first , everything fine . pictures ok . next day , my face looks like pile baby vomit . it soooo blury . then it got 2 point where every picture i took blury . i tried fixing it online(like program camera)and it would not work . i hate this camera !!! not mention battery sucks . it lasts maybe 3 1/2 hours . this camera should $99.00 . trust me people ...... if i could rate this thing zero i would . it not worth it . however , camera i absolutely love sony cybershot dsct5 . awesome little camera	-1
i purchased wp-dc700 underwater case my a70 followed directions exactly , oiling gasket cleaning it after each use . it leaked ruined my month old camera . customer service rude , blamed me then tried bargain me fix it $190 instead $280 they initially requested . underwater case 7 day waranty camera not covered water damage . my father similar problem his $1000 nikon digital which just stopped working no aparent reason , they claimed it water damage tried bargain him buy rebuilt one $500 . so beware bad customer service . canon customer service all bad unreasolved reviews better business burea	-1
main reason buying this camera able take good pictures far away . quality very poor . unit very bulky carry around your neck . sd card slot some block it . i not able even insert sd card . all all , not satisfied all	-1
i read all reviews comments this kodak printer i could find . many gave glowing reviews . i'd just purchased new kodak digital camera , thought this printer dock would make perfect setup . i never able get printer perform kodak says it should . it caused some odd conflict , my computer would not boot into windows xp printer attached computer . i ended up disconnect printer , turn my computer , then reconnect printer order use it . windows then always reinstall printer drivers . it made even more frustrating kodak tech support . i called emailed multiple times assistance . one conversation i literally told " i don't know what wrong can't help you . " now that tech support ! finally printer refused print telling me it out paper . i tried all kodak remedies , none worked . no matter how much or how little paper machine , it said there no paper . i even opened fresh pack find it still fussy not let me print . i can't recommend this printer . i could give better recommendation kodak itself , through its tech support , least provided my some competent assistance . i got 2 dozen prints , quite large cost printer supplies few prints before machine just failed work all . only positive i give prints i get looked good , color nice . i gave it extra star print quality alone . kodak name some strength behind name once upon time . it synonymous home photography once upon time . they've lost something over years , quality	1
title says it all : one month warranty expired , zoom feature camera broke , making horrible grinding noise if you attempted turn it . camera all but useless . fuji shop said they need replace lens assembly , cost least us$120 ; price , i'm buying new camera , but not f10 .	1
my experience , this camera takes great pictures , but zoom lens so delicate it breaks easily . it stops extending just makes clicking noise . this happened me when camera accidentally turned while my pants pocket rendering camera unusable . my brother two my friends experienced similar problem their ex-s500 after they accidentally dropped camera while lens extended . i would recommend looking into camera not so delicate	1
i bought sony icd-mx20 digital voice recorder week ago . i surprised sony not provide downloads associated software named " digital voice editor " . sony customer service staff told me if you lost cd came box , you buy new one . only patches software available download . customer service personnel told me it corporate policy despite fact software bound digital device . this immoral policy violating norm digital appliance industries should not encouraged . sony demoting its brand name offering poor post-sales services . think twice before making your buying decision .	-1
this camera/mp3/camcorder/webcam/voice recorder way good true ! i brought one because it cute looked perfect mini movies . but i sadly mistaken ... this camera just takes cheap pictures videos . only thing actully worked properly voice recorder i no need . after 3 days trying make it work little better i gave up sold it ebay same price i brought it . it great idea ... but it just isn't good camera but if you want voice recorder this pretty nice . mp3 player isn't all wonderful either . it doesn't work itunes . or easy work windows . hope this helps ... i wish i would read this before i brought this camera	-1
i bought this camera because i'm going jamaica i needed camera , video camera bonus . when i first tested it , it during night time , however well lit room , but i couldn't see anything . i figured i could deal long it took good pictures during day . when i stepped outside , which very bright sunny , all i could see screen white . i tried all settings still encountered white screen . only time i actually saw anything my screen when i inside during day . i brought it back right away , thankfully i bought it wal-mart they happy refund my money . i hope anyone reading this review take my advice not buy this video camera . i would loved give it zero stars if amazon gave option	-1

i no longer own my previous much finer camcorder , so i finally found myself market purchasing some kind camcorder until i could get back my feet get good one . i thought this one may , good price , looks sharp , purchased impulse . . . big no-no . i say camera takes decent pictures ( previous reviews state , almost exclusively outside broad daylight or indoors withvery good lighting ) . other than , don't bother . mp3 cutefunction ( quite possibly most practical ) . video , uhh , let'snot even go there . voice recorder , also not bad - records wav format transferred pc . jack all trades , master none . . . i guess would bestway finally describe this item . i say i'll saving up nowfor much better camcorder no more " i just gotta this right now " save your $ , find quality product - even if you pay little more it . trust me , it overall better long run . .	1

loved this camera first month or so i owned it . two years later my feelings very different . batteries need recharged constantly . camera rarely turns after off it dock more than hour . all i get flashing red light signifying batteries dying . zoom worthless , pictures turn out very blurry pixelated . flash also way too bright , half my pictures annoyingly " white " looking because this . definitely going canon my next purchase	1

i'm sure if camera worked properly , it would fantastic ; however , i received camera my birthday this year , only difficulty focussing mechanism . i took 4 blurry shots my son birthday party , next time i turned camera , lcd screen broken . we purchased extended warranty best buy , so when i brought camera ( 10 days old , mind you ) repair , they insisted i'd dropped it broken it ( which i hadn't ) , even though there no signs external damage ... no scratches , dents or anything . after sending it , best buy informed me it would cost us $180 fix , they wouldn't fix focussing mechanism until i'd paid lcd screen fixed . disgusted , i retrieved my camera customer service unfixed . i contacted sony , who appologized told me send my camera free repair . i ended up receiving call their repair center , informing me it would cost me $180 repair lcd screens not covered , whether i received it broken or not . i tried third time repair , only told i would pay . my mother tried use her buyer protection plan her visa ( it birthday gift her me ) , only her money refunded , then re-charged months later when best buy legal department wouldn't pay her visa bill . based upon our experiences ( among other bad experiences best buy ) , we stopped shopping best buy , now own lovely olympus camera . don't buy sony cybershot dsc-t9	-1

i bought this camera february 2005 but didn't know enought digital know what i actually get . goes through batteries pretty fast . recharge time pictures sometimes causes me miss good shot . takes way too much time pressing shutter button taking picture . i just thought this normal digital cameras till i began reading later reviews . then i accidentally dropped camera onto soft surface ( loose dirt sawdust)and now lens stuck most way out not retract camera not come . contacted hp get it fix but cost close $100 they just send reconditioned one . so i am market digital camera-maybe canon or sony or something besides hp	1
this camera worst !!! i bought this black friday there many reasons why i am returning this piece junk : 1 . first all , it runs double batteries2 . when i came home i started taking pictures . after i took my first picture , it said error saving image ! 3 . then it worked it didnt work . i tried downloading some pictures actually saved camera onto computer . when i finished downloading them , i looked pics computer . i f0und them but pics all blurry . i so fed up i left it sitting my computer desk next 2 months . not buy this camera , it waste your money time ! i actually thought hp made good cameras ..... -_-	-1
i only it few hours after i knew i would returning it . its video quality quite horrible , just better than videophone average webcam . i should expected it something this small this inexpensive . but honestly , i prepared myself something least better than what this camera . it quality not any better unless your outside , if you like me spend majority time hosting parties wanted something small capture fun , this would not . you basically need spotlights room if you want capture something film instead shadow . this also pain mac users . it says it able import files , yes it , but asf format . now you play it vlc , but think you'll able convert it , think again . it converts just fine , except without audio . i've tried converting video into several different formats all them come out without audio . so , mac users , pick something else . it returned , certain	-1

received dxg-506v yesterday surprised find out it no tripod mount . many sites showed light tripod optional accessories this unit but there no way mount these accessories cam . this kind like false advertising . this no deal me because cam so dark normal indoor lighting situations compared other cams similar prices ( like optimus radio shack sells ) there also no image stabilization . geez , how hard would it put simple � inch plastic mount bottom . sound , built microphone produces too much hiss located place not allow it pick up voices sounds what you shooting . you hear yourself talking great but not person you shooting . pretty bad . resulting audio hiss sounds like cheap 1970 cassette tape recorder . best thing this cam going it it save movies avi , mov or asx format different resolutions which why i got it first place . it also pretty easy learn its buttons functions seem fairly logical . it also lens cap . my advice dxg this . 1 . add tripod mount . 2 . move microphone forward something hiss tinny sound or perhaps add mic jack so i use external microphone . would sweet . 3 . improve cam so it better job normal indoor lighting situations . optional settings nothing improve this . i tried them all . bottom line i would kept this cam if it tripod mount . there just too many situations this comes handy it would allowed me add light cam indoor use .	1
this worst camera i ever owned my life . i fuji 1.3 mega pixle camera took better pictures than this one ! i taken this camera 2 vacations now , both times i brought my olympus slr film camera , both times , olympus pictures clearer , brighter all but maybe 1 work , this stupid sony cybershot , i end up deleting 3/4 pictures because they blury or all kinds funny things happening , only pictures work this camera during day time , or bright lighting . first vacation i went this camera , my friend brought her kodak 1 megapixel camera she got free it turned out better pictures , my olympus , second vacation i returned today i write this , i just downloaded my pictures , deleted 2/3 them because they so bad , ones came off my film camera perfect ! my sister also exact same camera which she brought her , i went through her pictures , same thing over 2/3 them didn't work , i would just assumed i'd gotten defective camera if it only my sony not work , however hers didn't either , i would also assume perhaps it myself problem , however , i took number exact same picture this sony well my olympus ( back up thank god i ) pictures olympus , well every other camera i ever used , come out fantastic , this camera though , they come out horrible , so bad fact i'm embarrassed show people ! believe me , if i hadn't gotten it free present i'd writing nasty letter sony , it though my next camera i'm saving up buying brand nothing but photography equiptment , therefore knows what they're doing . sony makes great tv home entertainment systems , anything else i've bought them , or known someone who , junk , their camera , their car stereos , their computers ! sony should stick tv home theater , it what they're good , camera not so much , unless you're looking something cheap you'd only use day , even then i'd recommend disposable , they even work better than this camera	-1

i got dreaded " e18 " error after owning this ( naturally ) just over year . repairs least $100 , repairs only guaranteed 90 days ... even if exact same problem occurs again ! this clearly design flaw ( just read how many users same problem ) . my first photoshot broke after year half , since i liked ease use basic design , i chalked it up bad luck bought . big mistake	-1
this worst camera i've ever owned . i'm not exaggerating . i'm so upset wasting money it . only pictures turn out , outside bright daylight . it takes horrible pictures low light , there high level noise photos . video mode moves out its own , ruining video . i sometimes get colored lines down right side videos . my friend $88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing . it just plain sucks .	-1
main reason i ordered this kit battery . when i received it .... no battery included . i contacted amazon all they could give me number sony customer service . thanks amazon !!	-1
i've just returned this camera poor facial image quality after using it extensively months . my regular camera fuji finepix s602z which large bulky , but , takes superb facial shots . i tried casio due needing something small carry my purse special events i'm heartbroken incredible photo opps i've resulted poor facial quality . don't buy this camera if you care what everyone looks like . i've just ordered powershot sd1000 because facial detection feature it . hopefully , it better since i don't want carry my bulky fuji get great facial photos . i'll review cannon once i've it few months	-1
return ? ha ha !!! you must email them permission . they don't provide email address . i spent untold hours trying get them respond . they everything avoid returns . amazon just looks other way . don't it !	-1
i tried trick resizing , but honestly , image quality still abyssmal . images so low-resolution only vaguest detail comes out . please , if you're thinking buying this someone christmas this year , choose something else . it might okay someone low standards or poor eyesight , but anyone who see well knows what good digital image looks like , this huge disappointmen t.t he good news few years these digital keychains advanced offer much better performance - that almost guaranteed . so put this one " must buy mom " list 2008 christmas season . i very seldom write review , only wrote this one keep people making same mistake i	-1
what pile junk . three full seconds pass pushing shutter button when camera actually takes picture . if you move all during three seconds , picture blurred mess . even if you don't move , pictures turn out blurry dark . if you use flash , you get lovely white picture nothing . i can't believe they sell this thing .	-1
i've never ordered anything this disappointed . i ordered two these both didn't work . i contacted company tech support they told me send it back they replace it . i tried contacting ritz camera where i purchased item they refused give me refund . i am now stuck dealing this company horrible customer support . i never buy product this company again .	-1
i purchased this my wife valentine day . installation went fine but i two problems device . first , software picture transfers awful . you only select pictures your computer download - you can't see what photos device software . order delete photos you it manually device itself . i checked webpage updated software - no joy . crop feature nice ( well used ) but otherwise i feel like i am looking windows 3.1 application . second , image quality device very poor . i didn't very high expectations , but this lower than i expected . reminds me picture/screen quality very first color cell phone screens , maybe bit worse . you make out picture , but not much detail all . advice cropping photos only show headshots excellent idea , it only way get decent picture . overall , i'm little disapointed . but then , you get what you pay ..	-1
i would spend little more money buy better quality camera . picture quality not good all . i previously owned kodak camera same megapixels picture quality camera much better . just after year using kodak c300 camera , it stopped working i not use it much . i now own sony cybershot dsc-w50 takes great pictures , i haven't any problems it i using it almost daily basis since may 2006	1
i this camera year half . i got so fed up it i just bought new one . i admit , this camera takes decent pictures good lighting when zoom isn't used . however , this camera takes horrible pictures if zoom used . i would only recomomend this camera someone who just wants take pictures thier surroundings or younger person who getting their first digital camera	1
this first digital camera i purchased . i am adventurous person wanted something would stand up my lifestyle . this camera wasn't it . good*it compact , which pretty convenient*it several camera functions potential work well if you techno-savvy . bad*after snorkeling it 30 minutes , camera leaked broke . olympus replaced it , but only after my 2 month stay costa rica over . * functions unreliable difficult use . rarely if ever i get them work how i want . pictures always need touched up afterwards , sometimes seriously . * zoom sucks . don't expect get those awesome close ups they advertise unless you some serious patience . * image stabilization joke . you need tripod or surgeons hands take pictures aren't blurry . * user manual left me lot questions	1
we use our videocameras tape preschool classrooms observations . hope use microphone isolate conversations . test microphone . i went noisy starbucks , huge lines , moderate music tons conversations . i recorded video cameras mics , then used zoom mic then used gun feature . i aimed microphone barista yelling out coffee orders . all instances , there no difference sound quality . i then went sony style store mall her open different microphone allowed her install it . she read package distance then we listened it all three settings . we could not find any difference . i checked camera instructions there no setting external mic . once mic attached turned , external mic suppose override board mic . i am still insearch gun mic digital camera . many new camcorders hard drives dvd drives not mic input or active interface shoe . i would rather want mic input so i use more powerful mic rather than mercy sony create one their shoe . overall , i am stuck . if i record something interesting i probably try enhance audio portion while editing .

hi , i vdr-d300 6 months now . i never gotten recording session last more than 20 min . camcorder constantly locks up , usually after 10 min . this full battery - unit never gets even battery alarm . several times reset button nor reset proceedure per manual works . i must faulty unit . i'm investigating repair . unit great lens , camera , video image , but my unit not stable all	-1

i love my nikon coolpix 5900 however , lens failed less than one year . service took 6 weeks repair . lens failed again after less than 10 days after repair . why lens failing open again ? i absolutely hate inconvenience returning this item again service although i paid plan it . why can't warranty fast , local competent	1

instead this pick up plextor convertor box . it takes output camcorder ( composite/rca or s-video ) compresses mpeg-2 ( dvd ) or mpeg-4 ( or divx ) includes software which easily burns dvd or cd ( mpeg-1 or mini dvd ) . look plextor m402u box . unless you really want deal 3.125 mb data per second ( 25 mbps ) , or 180 mb per minute , or 11 gb per hour through firewire link , get m402u . your options greatly expanded , you won't tell difference looking	-1
i say i really wanted like this camera . it takes good pictures ultra-wide lens nice feature . it quite compact nice screen . software reasonably good nice presentation user interface . why 2 stars ? ok here bad stuff : 1 ) first shipment i got , normal mode ( non-ultra-wide angle ) didn't work . images garbled almost unrecognizable . ultra-wide images fine . i attributed it getting random lemon returned it even exchange . second v570 i got amazon worked fine until 5 months later then normal mode crapped out me . so , i don't think it just random problem . there appears reliability issue non-wide angle part this camera since it seems statistically unlikely i would randomly get two cameras exact same problem . my v570 now nice-looking paperweight i use casio exilim ex-z70 . 2 ) stand seemed nice first until it came time travel . you unhook whole thing lug it around you if you want charge your camera or download pictures movies without card reader dongle . also , since you charge battery camera , you can't charge spare battery while you taking pictures other . comparison , my new casio ex-z70 usb cable easy stick pocket my bag external battery charger . so , if one battery dead i leave it behind charger while i take pictures spare . 3 ) movies you take this camera stored mov format instead avi or mpeg . while it play most pcs if you installed quicktime , it not supported my streaming media player ( d-link dsm-320rd ) difficult work video editor/dvd creator sw i use ( sonic mydvd ) . i can't say how widely mov supported compared avi mpeg , but format created problems me . so , i applaud kodak not clinging sinking boat anchor photographic film business going digital . but i think few more usability studies more attention reliability would help make this winner future iterations	1
bought this xmas present myself - bring family photos while business travel . i'm now 2nd unit ( exchanged directly w/phillips ) , am still same issue it not reliably working external ( my case , sony memory sticks ) . internal memory pitiful , unless you want resize all photos you put it , you not going able hold very many internally . i've yet get auto on/off feature work , while it perhaps pc friendly device , it certainly not always mac friendly - controls cumbersome work , directions meager . i wanted able carry this backpack or carryon bag , fact support stand can't folded tight against unit makes it difficult this - course , no mention this product description . also no mention it only supports older memory sticks - no support new , ms produo sticks ( no mention product descriptions either)i thought i would get quality product phillips , this certainly looked like it potential - unfortunately , it turned out piece junk , one i've screwing around so long it probably not returnable . don't waste your time dollars .......................	-1
this wonderful item if or when it works . it prints pictures beautifully if it works . trouble after using it little while ( i mean little while ) it quit feeding paper lights start blinking saying you out paper you out ink . i messed it messed it , some you who same problems sometimes cleaning feeder roller rubbing alcohol get it work but this doesn't work all time . right now my printer won't work i cleaned roller it very aggravating paper ink aren't cheap . i think it cheaper going down walmart using their instant photo machine . this not worth money or aggravation !!!!	-1
camera operates good , but i thought it suppose new . it looked bit used cracked bottom . it work , but unfortunately all packageing tossed out	1
... but it stopped working after year . only thing lens sees now black , although camera still turns i look pictures i took before problem started . nonetheless , i loved this camera , i think it worth it , even though it only worked year . now i've learned my lesson buy longer warranty or exchange new camera	1
after doing bunch research , i bought two these my teenage kids since they said not defective sony ccd late model 2005 point-and-shoots all seem . first zamera lasted six months before lcd display began worsening exhibit dark striations . after few days , camera dies completely . second camera made it two months before falling prey same disease . one camera . . . fluke maybe . but two ? suggests real problem so beware .	-1
i looking pair roof-prism binoculars like this , hawk bird watching . i looked swarovskis , but they way out my budget , nearly thousand dollars this resolution . these binoculars crystal-clear , sharp focus . 42mm lens lets lots light , lots more than 35 i've using . i wear glasses twist- up- -down eyecups blessing . there also attached lens protectors 42mm , nice because i always used lose them . price , these can't beat	1
i've read good reviews this camera this other sites but i am not same experience . quality photos horrible so i started thinking it me i tried it different settings , tried very , very still etc but , i only get one good shot out ten . i fuji 4mp i bought 6 years ago it takes way better pictures than this . i bought this so i could give my old one my daughter but i'm gonna end up giving this one my daughter keeping my fuji . we recently snow here tucson so i took pictures mu fuji compares them canon 6 year old fuji finepix beat it hands down . i don't get it , i get defective camera or am i doing something wrong or this camera just suck	1
i originally purchased samsung duocam scd6040 . it fortunately broke 1 week before warranty ran out . video began giant pixilated squares when video taping playback . though under warranty , it still cost me $49 ( their fee ) send camera repair . repaired camera came back broken . i deal many customer service people , but finally got them agree mine " lemon " they sent me scd6550 . now 10 months later , video playback this duocam broken . you see black screen yellow blocks lcd through viewfinder . i cannot video tape or playback anything tape . it not under warranty . i can't believe their cameras/duocams don't last longer than one year . they must use cheap parts . please save yourself headache chose brand .	-1
add previous reviewers , i very disappointed this camera performance . i compared " 5 megapixel " photos photos taken my canon , powershot g3 ( 4megapixels ) , scd6550 simply not produce same quality stills . camera itself also seemed flimsy . idea two-in-one camera so attractive . but attractive concept , canon elura50 , offered camcorder compact design . end , however , it broke down only after year half . $500 purchase not durable lifespan ( cf . reviews elura50 you see many hardware problems ) . this camera seemed less durable than elura50 i maneuvered various parts dials . course , i am returning camera before it prove its durability . nevertheless , maybe folks cnet stake their money it . lastly , i should add positioning record button function dials poorly placed . i found i use both hands when switching back forth camcorder still cam modes well simply engaging record button . this definitely takes away idea convinient solution capturing those special moments . again , this camera great idea . but , i suppose we should wait until manufacturers make one both solid hardware quality image recording . this one right track , but , still so far accomplishing quality product .	1
these not pioneer boxes . these mbi boxes . i bought them very disappointed since i also bought pioneer boxes before , when i compared mbi , latter one much less sturdy even index cards flimpsy compared pioneer . not buy these . also , adorama customer service very unfriendly regard making their customers satisfied . they insist they same , i need return them my cost , because their mistake . they flew one reason blame they never carried pioneer products , amazon mistake naming them pioneer . but then their own website also named them pioneer . anyway , just reconsider buying any products this company . it not worth it , considering shipping outrageously high . it my honest opinion .	-1
this scope not good starter scope anyone interested astronomy . here why : 1 . objective too small , only 60 mm , 2.36 inches , so it too small bring light necessary even beginning look universe . i suppose it adequate moon , but it . planets appear very small disks . one able see saturn rings , but image very small . forget it deep sky objects , clusters , galaxies , etc . 2 . 4mm eyepiece too powerful this scope . observer find it hard look through ( very small eye opening ) , most cases cause blurred images . 20 mm eyepiece only functional eyepiece . barlow 3x , which again too poweerful this scope . 3 . mount vibrate when touched , which cause image eyepiece " shiver " , which very frustrating . even low price , don't enticed this scope ; it too many flaws . save your money larger scope better mount . jim " konedog " koenig , astronomy buf	1
so this my first digital camera , got it last july my birthday . i go lot concerts , so i needed camera could take pictures not good light take pics moving subjects . well , two days after i got it , i festivale watching my fav band perform screen went white . it would still take pics , only you couldnt see them . after changing batteries turnign it off , it went back normal . alarmed , i called samsung they told me couldnt anythign until it white again . it only it couple times after so i never called again . but only one thing wrong it . this horrible camera concerts , pictures always blurry . shoot , even when im my house pics still come out blurry sometimes . tuesday i went see my fav band again , dumb thing goes white . it woudnt stop , no matter how many times i turned it off again . now flash broke i'm ready throw it against wall . you can't trust this camera . you never know when it take good pics or bad pics . i wouldnt even consider buying this camera minute !	-1
reciept tripod , i found it wrapped packed ( outside)in manner should insured undammaged product . when i opened box , i found tripod looked like it run over fork lift then thrown into box . there minimal packing around tripod itself , mostly just nylon bags prevent scratching , nothing keep unit tossed around . i wonder quality control prior shipping . also , if you not familure how assemble work this type tripod you better served different model or company , instructions not part their package	-1

i purchased , through work , powershot s70 july 2005 . i've always owned nikon products personally , but features price s70 swayed me away my usual nikon brand loyalty . 12 months i've s70 , it sent factory twice repairs -- second time just 6 days before warranty expired . first time it sent because lens door failed turn camera it almost come off its track . eight months later , flash quit working all modes door failing again ! flash door problem occurred while i yosemite np , so you imagine disappointment place like camera only half functioning . now , warranty expired i hold my breath every time i slide lens door open . i no faith canon s70 lost lot faith canon products whole . only bright side this experience factory repairs completed within 2-3 weeks , which i thought fast warranty work	1

i received pandigital 7 " photo frame ( dpf70-2 ) christmas gift haven't able get sd card slot function . when connecting pc via usb cable it tells me removable device needs formatted . windows attempts format card fails . i'm able format card usb card reader copy pictures sd card ok . when i insert sd card into photo frame doesn't display any pictures , just blue frame around picture location . i contacted pandigital tech support via 800# never received call back so i sent them email . i received email response back after several days . they me try several things resolve issue ; this troubleshooting process went more than week no avail . they eventually acknowledged photo frame appeared defective , when i asked exchange photo frame ( taking advantage 90 day warranty advertised their site ) , they told me return it store it purchased . i not consider this very good customer service ; i would not recommend this product .	-1
i bought this camera my 13-year old son take him soccer trip bermuda . it ok . felt sort cheap , but seemed like it would what it supposed . big drawback .... there no lens cover slips into place when picture isn't shot , so danger scratching lens immense . my son so afraid scratching lens , he barely used it . some few pictures he take ok , but others not best quality . i think this camera bit too costly what you get , i'm surprised , because i usually love samsung products	1
i two 8 " picture frames other brands , they great i use them open houses all time ! i got this one gift friend , it terrible !! instructions difficult understand . wide screen makes everyone picture look fat distorted ! this weird size i am not happy all !! i don't recommend it	-1
not worth money spent it . after reviewing info my new digital camera i followed suggestions get rechargeable batteries kit save money aa batteries . i not need camera case came this kit , it really too many pockets my liking . batteries not hold charge . i only got few pictures taken before they went dead . if spare set sat camera few days they too dead . least i got full set pictures taken duracell ones . i would much rather buy batteries them hand then always running back charger after few shots . i no experience rechargables before so i not know if this common . but i returned this item defect because this amount money you should get more then six pictures per charge	-1
this camcorder worked well , but i two complaints it . 1 . sound track you hear noise recording head moving back forth , sounds like woodpecker . this alone made it unacceptable or what i wanted . 2 . i wanted high quality video , but since it records small dvd disk , video compressed before it recorded disk . this causes some loss detail picture , especially if you're going edit it rerecord video which i need . if you just want camera record small dvd which you then play dvd player ( not all dvd players play small dvds ) this camera might acceptable . i returned it bought panasonic pv-gs35minidv camcorder which uses minidv cassette tape . much better video quality because its not compressd , no noise tape drive	1
i used this camera once no good photos show it . it took 5 frames then skipped several took 2 more , then nothing rest roll . we swam sharks i nothing show it . should bought disposable one	-1

i purchased this camera my 13-yr old daughter her first digital camera . it christmas present so i am highly dissapointed 3 months after purchase , flash stopped working . picture quality good but it hardly makes up fact she no longer take photo indoors or low light . i would not recommend this camera .	-1
i found case that almost exactly like this one , except it $10 cheaper . it made samsonite . model # tm90blu ( there also black case ) . but like i said , exact same thing . unless you care your camera case saying " lumix " , save yourself some dough get one wal-mart	-1
i keep this frame all day night . lcd backlight should last longer than 4 months but mine just burned ou t.t he quality pictures okay if viewed distance but low res . not good if viewing up close . there no external power controls or remote so turning this unit off drag . regular lcd backlights should last few years even if it stays all day night . this one just lasted 4 months . so image almost non-existant now . glare , you barely make out image so it still there but no backlight so good dead . i would recommend more expensive philips ones . my friend it two years it still going . plus it higher res more controls such timer function also play video clips , which this one can't	1
i bought this product nearby retailer . packaging deceptive . photoframe must plugged into external power source or you must buy uniquely designed battery manufacturer . battery $35.00 shipping , it poorly designed so when installed battery case rubs connector wiring . this frame no on-board memory , so use it you must one two types memory it accepts . this additional expense . after purchasing photoframe i discovered plastic frame chipped device not perform instructions said it should . i took it back store opened eight boxes before i found one which unbroken frame . i took photoframe home discovered device would not work instructions described . i then went retailers ' locations exchange device ( original location shipped their entire inventory back manufacturer ) . retailer very helpful clerks i tested three more photoco photoframe devices , none them worked described ( they would not scroll through album photos ) . i returned item retailer received full refund device , then email i requested refund price battery . photoco replied if i sent them battery they would refund its price . i mailed battery may 6 , then inquired my refund may 14 . photoco replied only employee who could process refund out sick . 3/17 i sent email demanding immediate processing my refund . photoco said my credit processed but i might not see credit 7 10 days . i still not received my credit battery . if you want avoid headach , avoid doing business this company . read other reviews before considering this product	-1
quite unsatisfied this product returning 2 i purchased gifts . fact , recipients asked me return them . main reason , order it " portable " it requires special battery you only buy manufacturer additional $30 . i already spent $100 , not planning spending more money . i think photoco needs rethink their product improve customer satisfaction .	-1
beware poor cs policy jvc . they recently let me down when it obvious camera poorly designed built . they not interested even trying help . i hate it when companies only care their profits	-1
battery good after full charge . it lacks holding promised charge . i find after 2 weeks it questionable , depending how many pictures taken before camera sat waiting used again . i got over 100 pictures when used 3 days , which more my aa nimh 2100mah . which i bought walmart { so probably not super battery } wallmart batteries actually hold charge longer { very sad } . charge time not long when charger half charge . over all , i hope next ones i buy better than these . my solution carry non rechargeable battery my case when delkin dies . i also try give it full charge before leaving house , there no memory effect . i also recomend checking see if there firmware upgrade your camera . every camera shuts off when battery different power level . my nikon coolpix 3100 , seems shut down sooner than later . all reviews should mention what camera they using this reason . using 3 months now .	1
my experience , this camera takes great pictures , but zoom lens so delicate it breaks easily . it stops extending just makes clicking noise . this happened me when camera accidentally turned while my pants pocket rendering camera unusable . my brother two my friends experienced similar problem their ex-s500 after they accidentally dropped camera while lens extended . i would recommend looking into camera not so delicate	1
we returned this video camera due video picture quality . camera requires lot light decent video , even after changing settings , video " grainy " look . we just needed something basic replace our 10 year old video camera thought this would work , but picture worse than our previous camera . purchased pv-gs65 , next model up 3ccd love this model . matter fact we still gs-31 , used same tape , shot same footage , reviewing two different shots , gs-65 100% better . camera great feel your hand , although menu button difficult press	1
i extremely disappointed this camera . it shame there no option zero stars , because it doesn't even deserve one . i bought two them vacation belize because we planning lot activities around water , we hoping capture those memories without risk our digital camera . now i really regret not putting little more money into waterproof case our digital camera rather than wasting money this camera developing pictures only worthy garbage . all pictures both cameras very grainy - terrible , terrible quality . camera we took pictures while diving slightly better than one we never even submerged water . those pictures so grainy we couldn't even tell what pictures supposed . extremely disappointing camera wasn't even submerged water . not mention both cameras said there more pictures left roll when there none , so we took shots we thought going really amazing only find they weren't even negatives . i so disappointed this camera i wrote kodak they offered send me two new disposable cameras . unfortunately our trip belize once lifetime trip , so i absolutely no need replacements - damage . i no desire ever use one these cameras again . if you planning using disposable waterproof camera capturing valuable memories , not waste your money this one . only thing you receive photo lab disappointment . i wish i more research before purchasing this one - please don't even bother it	-1
i purchased this camera took it beach . photos so bad , i threw them away . images all washed-out blurry . also , film advancing mechanism very tricky , so several pictures i took overlapped each other . i've used other disposable cameras before wouldn't let you take picture until film fully advanced next frame . this camera , i advanced film until mechanism stopped , camera allowed me take picture . unfortunately , film hadn't advanced fully next picture partially overlapped previous picture i taken . what waste money this camera ! thankfully , i also taken my digital camera , so i still some good pictures my trip :)	-1
i read reviews thought i'd still give it try . after one battery charge , i " lucky " enough defective unit - camera wouldn't start again after first charge . my observations first short use : - quality pictures very poor ( my pentax optio 4mp camera takes better quality photos ) -- very disapointing 6mp camera . - flash generally useless , actually hurt quality- camera very uncomforable if you don't very small hands . my wrist hurt after using it 20 minutes . - video ok , but focus very slow ( noisy ) . - i same problem several others -- camera died shortly afer getting it ( shows very poor quality ) . all-in-all don't waste your money . you get much better camera lower price	1
i really wanted love this camera . camera compact could fit into pocket my jeans ! i plenty research before choosing buy this camera so i expected all quarks unit mentioned other reviews . 30 frames per second uninterlaced video good - course it not good full resolution 60 fields per second video ... but unit fits into my pocket ! huge plus each " shot " individual file dragged off unit onto pc using usb cable . no further processing - file just copies plays quicktime , etc . great feature ability zoom while recording movie , which most point shoot cameras record video not allow you . now sad part ; amazon shipped me two units - both bad pixels lcd ccd . bad pixels lcd , according manual , expected " not malfunction " ; i disagree . cost unit there should no bad pixels lcd monitor . huge problem bad pixels ccd ! this results white pixels recorded files ; this compounded " image stabilization " . image stabilization shifts image ccd receives around attempt stabilize shot video - it works great ! however , video shifted stabilized white pixels shifted around screen well . it almost like there flies moving through every single shot you record . bad ccd reason why i can't love c6 ... i gave up hope sent both back amazon . i'm not sure what i buy now .	1
i bought this camera beginning january . i looking compact camera ( not necessarily pocket size , though ) capable taking great pictures also capable taking movies decent quality . based test reports dpreview other customer reports i decided fuji f31fd . i intrigued new sensor fuji using seems very light sensitive , which true . after receiving camera i took lot test pictures under various conditions , without flash , bright light , low light , different iso settings , different exposure times , etc . i compared pictures my 4-year old sony dsc-v1 results amazing . picture quality fuji very poor . colors ' smeared ' but main problem noise . even under bright light conditions iso 100 settings white considerable noise , same other colors ( rgb noise ) . i didn't check grey/black noise ( they test reports ) but noise white colors just too annoying . what disappointment . lens seemed pretty poor well , least there no comparison sony dsc-v1 carl zeiss lens . after one week we returned camera i bought sony h5 . this really great camera , i must admit . picture quality even better than v1 i thought v1 already pretty good . i only recommend sony h5 , even though it different form factor may therefore not really compare much smaller f31fd . what i liked f31fd its size , its responsiveness monitor menu . however , if picture quality so poor it also doesn't really help	1

this awesome little camera . except you can't use it night ! there horrible white spots nighttime photos when flash used . apparently these appear because flash so close lens this camera , so dust reflects badly . it known problem [ ... ] also , it totally annoying sony uses all their proprietary technology . result , cable connecting this camera computer unwieldly ( uhh , you heard usb ??!! ) , you buy sony memory stick , which probably won't work anything else you . flipside , you take movies aren't limited 30 seconds this guy - i think might result memory stick technology . but other than , design operation this little guy seems pretty slick . lens not one those pops out , so not sure if affects image quality all , but far i could tell , quality good . end , what good camera can't take usable pictures its flash ??	-1

case looks exactly pictures above , camera fits perfectly it . however , case hardly protection , it not considered more than carrying bag . velcro keeps it closed quite easy open so i've dropped case few times while walking outdoors . fortunately case designed use straps camera carrying it around , so my camera stays me any even t.t here little strap case , supposedly attach case camera or straps , but it opens too easily , so it can't trusted all ( strap almost opens very weight case , which not much ) . there also small pocket back , providing barely room enough set replacement batteries ( 4 aa batteries ) usb cable . again , velcro it too easy open , even more after placing batteries cable inside pocket . definitely , this not designed practical solution . just enough protect camera dust some scratches . if you value your equipment want protect it more than wind sun , while not worried losing case around -or its contents , don't buy this one . spend some more money get decent carrying case . i	1

bought this housing new november 2005 . april i used it first time it flooded first dive ! neither amazon ( since it ouside 30 day return policy ) nor canon stand behind this product ! period ! i got so much run around canon it ridiculous . they wanted " evaluate " housing determine if it defective ... dah ? they would not tell me if i sent it back " evaluation " what final resolution would ( refund , rework etc ) . coincidentally , person same trip same housing ... it flooded their first dive too !!!! coincidence ? no . just terrible quality control no product support canon . not buy canon products !!	-1
i bought this item over year ago , it never served anything . once i spotted deer turned " ir " illuminator , deer ran away - not too surprising , it actually red light totally visible most animals . better use flashlight . this first-generation nightscope , very small range utility : if there little light , adapted human eye sees better , if there almost no light device not see either . 100 bucks not too much waste , but if you serious nightvision you should spend 10 times much	-1

this scope not good starter scope anyone interested astronomy . here why : 1 . objective too small , only 60 mm , 2.36 inches , so it too small bring light necessary even beginning look universe . i suppose it adequate moon , but it . planets appear very small disks . one able see saturn rings , but image very small . forget it deep sky objects , clusters , galaxies , etc . 2 . mount altazimuth , which not follow celestial object sky . earth rotating , anyone focusing star or moon quickly find object drifting out field vision . better mount equatorial mount which makes it much easier track objects . 3 . 4mm eyepiece too powerful this scope . observer find it hard look through ( very small eye opening ) , most cases cause blurred images . 20 mm eyepiece only functional eyepiece . barlow 3x , which again too poweerful this scope . 4 . mount vibrate when touched , which cause image eyepiece " shiver " , which very frustrating . even low price , don't enticed this scope ; it too many flaws . save your money larger scope better mount . jim " konedog " koenig , astronomy buf	1

after reading great reviews regarding vct870rm tripod ( here elsewhere ) , i decided purchase one my sony hdr-hc1 camcorder . when i first opened box , vct870rm seemed sturdy well made . tilting action smooth nice touch , remote controls handle worked well . however , panning action so stiff while attempting pan , main column would twist handle would bend slightly . it felt like tension control knob tightened , but not case . fact , panning continued drag severely even tension knob completely removed . i recently found vct870rm review 5 years ago where somebody else same problem stiff panning . however , due all other great reviews this tripod , i'm assuming i just received bad one . i'm now process working amazon get replacement sent me . so far , amazon great , they've already scheduled ups come my home pick up defective tripod very next day . they say i'll receive my new tripod next week . i'll post here status new one when it arrives . update : i received new replacement vct870rm tripod amazon , this one works great . panning tilting both very smooth , tension adjustable . if i'd received this tripod originally , i would've given it 5 stars . first vct870rm i received definitely defective . i'm glad i returned it , i'm glad i bought it through amazon ( best price time , hassle-free return )	1

if i could , i would give this camcorder 0 5 . since i now search new camcorder , reading other panasonic model reviews , i am convinced i not just get lemon , but panasonic brand bad . we bought this camcorder 18 months ago birth our son . it problems beginning . first , i could not finalize disk . i called panasonic support , who basically told me problems we because camera not held still while recording . this ridiculous since i often set camera down countertop so i video . then i finally got someone tell me i needed recording panasonic mini-dvds . best it worked panasonic dvds which some most expensive , even no guarantee you able watch dvd after finalization . i still freezing picture sparatic playback when trying watch . it skipped over whole sections . i 3 dvd players my home ( all different brands ) disk works none them . i finally got address send it repairs . i not happy without my camcorder extended period time . i told they would look camcorder , see if there problem call me . i waited week after i knew it shop check status . panasonic failed mention i would need pay $207.50 up front them look it , then if any repairs needed , this cost would cover them well . so , i without camcorder 3 weeks while waiting see if it needed fixing , company i sent it not even looked it because i not paid them ! this crazy since i get brand new minidv camcorder $225 . only reason it taken me so long take drastic action because we military living overseas bought it best buy . so you see why i couldn't just take it back store ( or i would long time ago) ! also after spending over $500 this piece junk , i could not afford just replace it . sending it not option when my son newborn , because i didn't want miss any precious memories ( which i ened up missing anyway ! ) . so now holidays upon us , i forced purchase camcorder , since i don't know if they send it back me time christmas . i not pay $207.50 camera hasn't worked well out box . i also pay shipping both ways nothing ! plus thing , still picture bad quality . very grainy you actually see pixels when you print it . we only used function once . i lost so many disks , so many others only play part dvd when i think it i cry . i also wasted so much time trying figure out how fix problem customer support useless . i wish i would never bought this camcorder ! if you buying this camcorder capture memories , buy ! i not buy panasonic products again !	-1

i purchased this camera december 2005 replace my 7 year old sony digital 8 camcorder . unfortunately , everything except size inferior panasonic compared " ancient " sony . color not nearly sharp , low light capabilities laughable battery lasts half long . sound quality adequate if not watching playback camera itself . camera highest volume setting too low use if you want listen while loading video into your computer editing program . panasonic relatively convenient manual exposure feature many other minidv camcorders lack . this allows better light control when shooting auditoriums spotlights . it uses toggle control exposure , while it not easy external thumb wheel sony , it adequate . unfortunately , it functions so poorly low light it wouldn't provide adequate color auditorium . i thought image stabilization would great feature but my video much shakier panasonic than my old sony . maybe it because camera so small it hard keep stable larger sony . video editing pc equally easy sony panasonic but panasonic poor user manual would make it very difficult novice figure out your picture quality much better sony digital 8 . if you don't record minidv format or built 3 megapixel still camera , i'd recommend buying inexpensive sony digital8 third price gs250 . if you minidv camera you won't shooting bright sunlight , try brand . this upper end 3ccd camcorder now home closet shelf where it stay unless i need very small camera chase action cross country race or similar event sunny day . otherwise , i'll use old sony so i share video i shoot without embarrassed picture quality	1

i bought this camera after owning olympus digital camera years . i extremely happy my olympus , but wanted something smaller would fit my purse or diaper bag since i'm expecting . this camera such disappointment . just every single picture i took huge white blobs all over it . ( this only happened when using flash . i must admit camera takes great pictures broad daylight without flash . ) plus , if you used zoom all , pictures came out fuzzy . first digital camera i ever owned ( 7 years ago ) took better pictures ! store i bought camera wouldn't take it back because i waited two days past 14-day return policy . so , i sold camera took $100 loss . i'd much rather lose $[ ... ] than keep this camera	-1
leather case magnetc latch , magnetic force strong enough sd card stick onto it . i not lost any images yet camera not gone haywire , but i decided not chance it . i am surprised canon cautions against placing camera strong magnetic fields their user guide yet produce accesory this feature ! although constructed fine leather , case also very bulky , making tiny slim elph twice thick too big fit into pocket or purse . neck strap ok , it looks metallic but wrapped inside clear plastic tubing , making it look quite cheap stiff , again increasing bulk camera . battery works fine , but two other accessories not worth extra money	-1

i bought this over sony i regret it . i get tape eject error every time i try rewind . i only rewind 10 second intervals before i get error message eject tape same thing over again . that long time rewind 60 minute tape . many canon users this problem only way they address problem which clearly mechanical problem charge ridiculous price send it off repaired . canon needs own up this problem recall item . i never buy canon again after they turned blind eye serious problem	-1

i older canon camcorder i very happy , so i decided get this new one . i ended up shipping it back because tape noise so loud . i even tried same model best buy make sure it wasn't just defective camera . but compared similar sony model , canon noticeably louder while operating . way loud shooting anything resembling quiet conditions	-1
i found same problem other users this product experienced . particularly issue shutter release bottom camera when composing portrait oriented shot . i found stroboframe flash bracket rotates camera counter clockwise within flash bracket instead flipping flash . this leaves shutter release top camera also alleviated other problem speed light hot shoe breakage repeated " flipping " flash some other users reported . item manufactured stroboframe found ebay store called " gadget infinity " under listing title " flash bracket 90 degrees camera rotate feature " . buy it now price $29.99 . i just bought one it arrived yesterday i could not happier . pass word this ingenious new product solve issues plagued photographers past several years	1
e550 good camera this lens good job zooming subject but due way camera lens designed , you must camera zoom fully extended order use this tele lens . so this means if subject moving around lot , such my daughter playing soccer , you miss shots where action moved close you because you can't zoom out . long action remains some distance you than this zoom lens useful . i unfortunately too many ruined shots because action moved too close their heads get cut off , etc . negative viewfinder doesn't show zoomed image , you must use lcd screen frame shot , which difficult bright sunlight	1

this camera decent enough camera , compact , easy use takes good quality video still pictures battery life excellent . battery comes it good couple hours continuous recording tapes only last one hour . i acquired second battery good 240+ minutes so i never worry running out juice . i only two complaints really , one minor one major . minor complaint fiddly little controls touch screen lcd viewfinder . i find i need use my reading glasses see what i'm doing . major complaint transfering video my computer via ilink cable ( not supplied ) . i never persuaded it work . browsing various camera fora web i am finding complaint identical mine this model particular well other sony models . computer recognize camera usb mode ( capturing still pictures memory stick ) but not see it all when plugged via ilink ( firewire/ieee 1394 ) . all indications my firewire port cable perfectly ok . sony tech support , both web chat based phone , no clue because i am out warranty it cost flat $210 send it them take look it . if all you want connect camera your tv playback video you take , it good camera . if video capture editing what you mind , buyer beware . because this , i only give product 2 stars , other wise it would 5 . update : i installed new firewire pci card my computer using new cable tried video capture again . i also tried camera my neighbor mac ( theory if mac won't recognize it you really know you problem ) . computer still won't recognize camera . this camera used very little definitely not abused . it probably defective right out box it appears common problem . if you buy this , make sure you test all its capabilities soon you get it . don't wait like i because i'm out warranty it cost me get problem fixed	1
panasonic very compact , very stylish sexy my wife called it , but photos very disappointing : they way noisy ! even if set lowest asa setting 80asa it just barely acceptable they get progressively worse anything above 100asa . colours good , it take very good videos , but still photos just plain bad when compared other cameras photoshop cs2 . course it easy understand why : native resolution images . if one investigates such things , notice panasonic only 72 dpi , same sony , canon improves this 180 , nikon 300 dpi . it not just megapixels folks , but how those megapixels recorded what resolution . obviously camera 72 dpi more noise than one 180 or 300 dpi . so before you buy any digital camera or thinking upgrading newer model , yourself favour . try 4 or 5 cameras same megapixel range good camera store taking photos same subject same light condition . set camera lowest asa highest picture quality jpg format , take photos , pop sd card into computer , compare images photoshop . enlarge full pixel size ( 100%) , look meta data same time you see yourself . what i , since i not very happy images my panasonic produced ! i this camera 11 months 20 days exactly , today i traded it nikon p5000 after evaluating over dozen models including leica d-lux3 10mp camera , driving sales persons crazy all testing spending 4 hours store , but it very educational them too	1
i've just returned this unit . it doesn't play videos advertised . i able get it properly play . avi files 320 240 resolution ... see other review below . but 320x240 gives postage stamp size picture . 640 480 playback full size but jerky broken .... more later . i now 3 different brands 8 " photo frames my possession : phillips , pandigital , this coby . i developed following list features my " ideal " photo frame . first , video playback : i've taking lot video clips my digital still camera ... they come out well convenience not lug my camcorder , ability quickly transfer clip files within/between chips my computer attractive . i would like frame which play format my camera taking ( . mov , more later ) i'd also like frame play multi-media show ... , play movie clips show presentations , intermixed . jpg photo files . second feature play . wma music files , addition mp3 . this because i non-ipod personal music player . all my music . wma format because it roughly half file size mp3 . third , i would like timer my frame ... set it come morning , off night , example . fourth , i'd like audio or speaker out feature . none these frames home theater-like sound , i extra pair computer speakers i'd probably hook up . video out could come handy too . fifth , i'd like able rotate stills within frame software , manually or automatically . yes , you rotate them computer , but frame may or may not preserve rotation . ( this may depend which photo edit program you using . ) sixth , i'd like folder hierarchy file management system frame software . especially huge chips now available , i see advantage push couple buttons change picture set ( folder ) , rather than switching out chips . here where 3 units i've stack up , followed my next ( fourth ) unit . i am keeping pandigital .... which costco $140 . it plays . mov video files , but not within slideshow . it no speaker out jack sound tinny . it requires mp3 music files . it permits picture rotation . no folder management system . no clock/timer . no ability play stills/video intermixed . i think coby phillips picture quality brighter but pandigital ok . phillips didn't play video , since it also software glitch when i returned it i decided look elsewhere . ( no remote no music philips either . ) coby won't play my videos , even after i used my converter program try 10 different mp4 avi variations . coby plays . wma music files , won't rotate stills , no folder system , no clock/timer . it speaker out jack . it not permit intermixing video stills one multimedia show . picture quality fully equal philips , generally recognized standard . if all you want photos , never turn your camera sideways , this unit good value . unit i'd like get play would image moments model digitalfoci . i've exchanged emails someone there who clearly knows what they talking i believe this unit intermix my photos videos .	-1

after amature photographer via print film , i decided try digital camera - though i've leary printing quality . i knew i couldn't afford digital slr , so i opted " snap shot " camera i thought would enough features satisfy me . however , after using this camera year now , i am so disappointed performace- flash just way too much , its washout . after used print picture quality my film slr ( cannon , i might add ) , i so severely annoyed quality pictures this camera , i wish i would just saved my money digital slr .	-1
my 5-year old daughter spent all day taking pictures her her baby sister san francisco . we put new batteries morning . next day i wondering why picture numbers reset . when i tried download pictures my computer , they all gone , battery icon flashing . based what i've read here , it appears batteries died after one day use pictures all erased . picture quality same old camera phone -- pretty poor , but good enough my 5-year enjoy . but what good when there aren't even any pictures next day . i'm hoping store take it back	-1
first , i want defend this camera lack lcd viewscreen -- really unrealistic expect something like this price point . what wrong this camera it tries so many different things it doesn't one thing it needs well -- i.e. , take picture push button . this product would much better if you took out all settings ( what kid needs different resolution settings cheap camera , crying out loud ? ) simply put auto-flash . it , you must consult manual , push mode button until you find correct symbol flash ( which not intuitive , so you'll need carry manual you ) , press shutter button turn flash , wait little red light come , then you take picture . then you shut it off or it goes off itself after very short period inactivity , next time you want take picture you it all over again ! oh , i mention it won't take picture if there isn't enough light ( there wasn't even brightest room my house ) , so you must use flash ? clearly , makers this product not test it real children . heck , my digital camera easier use than this ! we never even got see picture quality -- after trying get it even take picture , i knew this going back store asap	-1

this microphone listed compatible accessory sony hdr-hc7 video camera most websites , including sonystyle . while microphone may good quality ( i didn't opportunity thoroughly test it ) , it only marginally compatible very poor choice hdr-hc7 . microphone plug into mic jack camera appears work , but shoe not fit hot shoe bracket camera . ( note there no direct way tell if it actually working without playing tape back , which point it probably too late make correction . ) after nearly hour very irritating chat room discussion , finally , direct conversation sony technician , i learned there " jury-rigged " bracket allow you attach microphone near camera tripod . otherwise , there no way fix it camera . sony technician finally admitted it " curious " sony lists this compatible microphone . if you sony hdr-hc7 , choose different microphone !	-1
i so dissapointed this camera ! i purchased sony cybershot 3 years ago , it such great camera , i automatically thought this newer model would great . almost every picture i took either blurry or light areas picture blown out ! experienced cybershot user , i tried all settings fix problem , but no luck . terrible capturing child first steps , description says . would not recommend	-1
i measured 7 batteries out pack 20 la crosse charger , which i also bought amazon . capacity ranged 547 mah 2002 mah , average 886 mah . that third stated capacity . before i took measurements , i made sure charger works properly testing it two different brands aa nimh batteries : la crosse energizer . both scored very close their stated capacity . therefore , test valid sunpak claim 2650 mah grossly overstated . my advice : avoid sunpak like plague !	-1
i spend hours pouring over reviews trying decide which ultracompact best deal best overall camera . end , it came down panasonic fx01 cannon sd600 . i read warnings other reviewers panasonic images weren't top quality , but i chose ignore those reviewers because paper fx01 looks like it would out perform sd600 . i wrong . after using fx01 few days i knew what those other reviewers talking - grainy photo after grainy photo . i really really wanted this camera great , but it just wasn't . actually , my old 3mp camera took better shots then 6mp fx01 ! very disappointing . i ended up returning this camera amazon ( very easy-great service ) because poor image quality . i mean , wanting good photographs why you take photos , right ? i know someone sd600 he very happy quality . judging customer images sd600 page amazon , i think i should've gone cannon	1
i received this christmas present . this digital camera works fine still shots , pictures my family , etc , but action shots , kids playing outside , basketball games , etc . it big disappointment . i took 47 pictures my son playing basketball our school gym only 5 them worth keeping . i've taken several games/activities try it out . i've tried using different functions , adjusting manual setting , playing zoom but nothing worked . many shots blurred , shadows ( because movement ) , or so dark people can't seen . i wish i would known this before i asked this camera .	1
after receiving case trying use it camera , i discovered it very cumbersome almost impossible manipulate . instance , you cannot access cf card or camera attached portion screwed into tripod mount , also , taking front cover off take picture hassle . this not useable carry-around use . i it sitting corner my office unused , spent good money nothing .	-1

i bought this replace my broken digital8 sony camcorder same sales guy who sold me sony 6 years ago advised me buy this jvc , one single criterion : near-infinite hard disk drive storage . this almost only claim actually fulfilled . summary : infinite recording time , disappointing image quality control price , painful editing . not average imovie user . positive points : - storage capacity : dream . i thought 7 hours high-quality video would barely last two weeks vacation . actually it took me months fill them . mostly because , digital cameras , you throw away all bad takes . i decided i'd keep all my previous good takes until i really would need space , well ... i still my best clips 5 months ago camcorder , which means i always show them friends family location , even if i don't my computer or dvd copies me . - size , weight shape : perfect . you take this camcorder anywhere without facing hard packing decisions . it small , feels rather rugged . i added wide-angle lens bigger optional battery , which makes camera 50% bulkier but still manageable . shape great , least my hand size . i really grab camera properly various situations verticality bumpiness ... microphones not well placed though , i often cover them my fingers . - image stabilization : very good . chance i shot clip my wide-angle lens way , which gave me good fixed reference see how beast fast smooth correcting unwanted shakiness . - ease connection : usb2 link ok . i'd preferred firewire , but here we not dealing video streams but video files . btw , this allows faster-than-real-time transfer . firewire link camcorder acting hard disk would great ... ok points : user interface , reaction time ( even if it takes long time get ready ) , optics , battery life ( 3 hour batt . - actually 1.5 hours ) . negative points : - image quality : considering price , image quality disappointing . frankly . viewfinder flattering but color saturation fact low , clips shot sunny days seem sadder than they i found out after shooting whole week yucatan . clips shot my digital camera ( canon ixus 60 ) look better . there also lack control image quality . - digital camera : simply forget it . my phone takes better pictures . i'd advise you buy 2mpix+ cellphone enjoy benefit sending your pics videos immediately far-away family pals . - file transfer editing : pretty horrible originally supplied software . marketing copy , mpeg2 files might seem nice target format , but we always edit our videos , this quite painful , whatever power-users might tell you . you hours conversion , except if you burn your raw takes , risk boring your audience . i going write " don't buy this if you mac user " . this not imovie ready . i both pcs macs , it equally painful disappointing , except if you buy yourself real video editing suite . still , if you mac everio get yourself wonderful mpeg streamclip free utility squared 5 . it allows batch conversion everio . mod files into useable formats . you'll buy mpeg2 component apple first change . mod extensions . mpg prior conversions . time- disk-space-consuming but worth it , image quality superior one generated jvc-supplied software . neat thing : leave your computer homethough you can't use camcorder external hard disk ( it write-protected ) you copy photographs sd card hard-disk , which means everio , you wont need bring your computer trip just store pictures your digital camera . conclusion : given choice , i won't buy this camcorder , mainly below-par image quality , i'm ready cope complications conversion editing . but i'd seriously miss storage capacity	1

i read other review , decided give it try . soon i recieve it mail , opened box , i realized this mistake . cheap quality binocular " high power " selling point . it came already broken two eye ruber pieces falling apart . you see how cheap glue used put it place ! it extremly heavy hold hands more than one minute nature observation . you constantly ajdusting focus . your fingers bumps focus bar while you holding it . indeed strap , case , lense protectors all cheap crap , annoying it all ~ ! i am taking this back , buying made japan " nikon eagle view " 100 times better . you get what you pay ~ !!!!!	-1
first day i took them out hunt them they fogged over . i brought them home there fog inside . also inside some dark crap you cannot get ... it lens . i called bushnell help line they told me ... " well , it isn't internally fog proof , just externally " when asked stuff inside . " probably fungus , sometimes happens " i just bought binoculars !!! he stated i could send them miss my entire hunting season they would take fungus out . avoid these all costs !!! they shoddy product even worse strap plastic cuts into your neck	-1
if you like take pictures macro lense , it sucks . i've many canon cameras this one takes prize worst quality . if you get closer than five inches , pictures messes up . i've no other problem hardware , though i hate carrying around dock it odd shaped charger . no other charger cable world going fit ! so loose it you're screwed . oh , night photos also suck . big time , even flash	-1
this great back pack ! if there anything i would change it would logo front . it brite shinny , i'd rather not advertise i camera there ! i colored it felt pen it works great ....... overall , i love backpack !!	1
i've this lens 2 months now , love it . it my first " " lens i see quality difference this line . first , i tried 28-135 is-pretty good . but i wasn't totally happy , so returned it ordered 24-105 . now i'm happy . contrast , sharpness , ca much better . build quality feel superior well . plus really works . i try get all lens future , i believe it worth extra cost . focusing very quick zoom action smooth steady . if you're budget , 28-135 real nice . but go all way , i recommend this lens . 24-105 quieter i found . price bit steep , but optical quality there , resale value remain good , weather sealing should hopefully keep dust junk getting inside this lens .	1
controls little complicated get used , especially all-manual settings -- which should definition easy use -- but overall this camera very rugged very capable . after i bought it , i took d10 budapest , hungary . i great view danube set my camera up night shots . it brilliant job . how this : take digital night shot ( use largest image size possible ) , use 300mm lense blow results up 24x30 through shutterfly.com . image remained amazingly sharp . colors fantastic . camera made it easy look like pro . only gripe i this camera i wish it black white setting like other less expensive canon digitals , but this overcome software so it not huge issue . price great , it magnesium body ( vs . rebel plastic body ) . you get lot d1/d20/d30 , without cost	1
i'm sure there those who'd wax philosophical over subject filters how one brand " much better " than , but my canon ef-s 10-22mm 20d , i figure canon would fairly good making filter they're willing branded " canon . " it fits fine , doesn't interfere lens hood , looks clear , seems attenuate nasty ultra-violet part light spectrum perhaps best all , protects front element . what more would one want	1
i didn't ton time research this flash . i've used it now several occasions my canon 5d couldn't happier it . it great shooting portraits . i shoot 10 shots row flash keeps up . i would definitely purchase plastic diffuser - get rid typical flash harsh light	1
wow !!! this my 4th sony , i keep trading up i am so impressed . there no delay shutter speed , great pictures enough special effects fun , but not enough you need phd operate	1
good remote . finnicky times if not lined up correctly camera	1
don't listen reviews claim this lens not good choice cropped sensor cameras ( ie 20d , 30d , rebels etc ) canon lens best this particular lens no exception . i lens less than 24 hours now am love sharpness color already . great lens , great color , so well built , super sharp , just watch out if this your first lens , you'll hooked . this lens you many years , great investment	1
nick xu , if you can't figure out difference this lens , cheaper consumer grade lenses , all means , stay cheaper consumer grade lenses . after all , " mr magoo " cartoon fame couldn't tell chevy rolls royce . all kidding aside , this lens simply awesome use . one these lenses camera bag very close practice owning three or four high end prime lenses . yes , it good . i am using borrowed version right now , but soon i pay off my new 24-105 f/4 usm lens ( very , very awesome ) , i buy my own 70-200 f/ 2.8 usm . it good it gets this lens range , but if you feel comfortable pinhole camera , carry , it all end user . everyone else , this lens holy grail mid range telephoto lenses . it simply best available it range , responds well canon tele adapters . if you figure out way afford this lens , buy it , it all . if you nikon lover buy this lens anyway , buy fairly cheap 20d body make it work . it ok tell your friends you used nikon take pics , but you end up knowing canon premeir lens crafter 21'st century . ( sorry , nikon fans , but this lens stands all it self grand scheme things . it simply awesome . )	1
money , you absolutely can't beat this lens . it very fast sharp . not fast focus , but what you expect $70 ? i four lenses , some costing 4x much this one ... yet i use this one most . anyone looking step up kit lens , or anyone looking buy camera body w/out kits lens should look buy this lens	1
i my canon eos 30d week after 500 shutter actuations i am completely addicted photography . i bought 17-85mm canon lens it takes phenomenal pics especially using software post-processing raw . i also 70-300mm lens sports/outdoors/nature bursts 5fps beautiful sound . i bought camera through dell rebates currently this best deal out there ! strongly recommend . pay extra $$$ get this over rebel xti . you won't disappointed	1
i not trust any batteries except canon my canon cameras . i found " compatible " batteries not always charge incanon charger , not last long camera	1
this uv filter it job protect lens well . build solid ( metal construction ) . glass also descent quality . performance , it absorbs some uv light . uv light absorbtion hardly noticeable , probably sky 1-a haze filter version absorb more uv light than this lens which fine me . now , one problem which internal reflection . i've heard many people say it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out it not caused directly low light/night situation . internal reflection appear when there strong/bright source light comparison overall exposure ( surrounding environment ) . put it example ( which hopefully easier understand ) , when you take picture lamp during nightime light much brighter than surrounding area then you see internal reflection . you move position light closer sides/corner picture ( not center picture ) , internal reflection reduces finally dissapear ( if you move light far enough center ) . if light isn't too bright/contrast compare surrounding environment then there no internal reflection . but course most time , lamp nightime often very bright . but point i'm trying make internal reflection doesn't happen all time during low light or night time . additionally , internal reflection isn't only happening night . it also happen afternoon if you taking picture sun example . basically same rule above , how bright light source compared surrounding area , you move sun center photo near side internal reflection move side/dissapear ( also depending angle ) . but best way just remove filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you reduce occurence internal reflection identifying correctly when internal reflection occur then remove filter during those situation ( which not hard ) . i'm actually not fan lens filter ( any filter ) i think it only degrade picture quality we added layer sensor object , but i decided use them anyway all my lens . i would recommend everyone get one this filter if you don't any filter your lens yet .	1
just returned trip hawaii opportunity put this lens test . i very pleased results . this powerful lens , yet it relatively light weight not burdensome use . i able get some really amazing wild life shots birds , zooming distance hand held camera ( canon eos 20d ) virtually every shot keeper . feature allows you quickly zoom compose your shot fire it off image quality excellent sharp focus . usually lens this size this much power requires firm grip almost always tripod - not so this one . i shot both portrait landscape mode i didn't see any problems focus , clarity or sharpness . all images clean razor sharp . if you looking long lens ability bring distant shot without use tripods other equipment , i highly recommend this lens your arsenal .	1
i able use canon ef 1.4 ii extender some nature photography recently wyoming . i shot elk low light conditions so i shooting pretty much wide open . extender not compromise inherent sharpness lens all . you could see hairs animals heads . it fantastic	1
i'd stating obvious preaching choir if i said care lenses slr cameras required decent lens cap . this one snaps into 58mm threads end many lenses ( canon otherwise ) , so just sure confirm it proper size your lens	1
i purchased this camera online one month ago amazon here [ ... ] i taken pictures alaska florida washington i love how mark ii captures images imho more clearly than any film slr could ever take . best camera i every use	1
if you've found these reviews , you already know this lens one best canon products out there . i not bite version , i not found myself ever wishing i ; this lens everything it hyped up performs well low-light/indoor situations . i don't think it weight big deal . i really don't any problem carrying this lens around day -- my hands or bag -- even 1.4 extender attached . it feel bit heavy but i don't mind , neither you when you see results later . i've used this lot shooting professional baseball it landed me front page ink several times . my mind , i could get 1.4 extender this lens give myself 70-280 range , which pretty adequate most sports nature photography , considering 300 f/ 2.8 it friends much , much more expensive . lens works basically just fast sharp , my opinion , 1.4 f/4 , although some may debate this . flip any baseball or football game you see this lens around neck most every pro . if you swing price , enjoy it ! my advice continue reading up this or similar products , although i found most everyone agreed , this one finest lens around . it one makes people stop stare wonder who you	1
i purchased canon off camera shoe cord use canon ex 580 weddings . i needed cord use flash braket avoid red eye . it what it supposed . no complaints .	1
i waiting 3 years any manufacturer market camera similar specification canon eos1 . exploration health , safety environment advisor , work takes me middle desert or oceans . wait 35mm film quality , speed picture taking ( 5 frames per second barely enough capture dolphins - hence 8 + fps eos 1 desired ) . there parallel wait image stabilised 28-300 zoom lens . let cut story short . if i want camera bring holiday , it would not this one - battery charger too heavy bulky ; instead i would choose eos20d without hesitation . but hundreds failed 35mm film frames i decided not wait any longer but buy eos1d mark ii because 1ds mark ii not fast enough 4 frames second . 35mm cameras , after few seconds shooting , i would run back inside cabin ( ship ) change film . if there large enough memory card eos1dii , there no need . this camera built seals against environment ( so 28-300mm lens ) . instead scared running out film , now it easy keep shutter button pressed while panning ( hoping ) dolphins their jumps into air . 28-300mm lens attached , there no need change lenses either . dolphins riding bow wave ship could captured 28mm while those further away could caught 300mm setting . it disappointment battery not lion but older nimh . but any photo gear requiring battery it wise spare , whatever substance . i just wish canon package small travel size charger instead standard one which very bulky . it connections two batteries ( yet it could only charge one following other ) but most people would happy using one battery while other one charged . you just try convince some airport officials let you plane above kit , binoculars , laptop , mobile phone , gps ....... ext . hard disk .... hand luggage . work , i am committed therefore bear weight troubles hauling hardware . but holidays , i would choose eos20d built-in flash because who would want lug around 3 kilos all day plus flash gun possibly tripod ? camera gets 4.5 stars but battery charger lets it down . why just 4.5 stars ? one beauties i thought digital slr not anything processing , just transfer images computer . wrong . . jpg straight out camera not sharp enough . post processing required . why ? why necessary when canon s60 ( which i use different assignments ( underwater housing )) doesn't need ? defeats point . jpg file 5.5 meg when 1.5 meg s60 looks sharper straight out camera ? still , there raw if standard output not suficient . incidentally , eos1dsii also produces 5.5 meg . jpg those also require post processing . those us who not interested working longer than necessary ( me ) 16.7 million pixels would seem bit wasted . i am still waiting camera which produces sharp . jpg files in-camera without post process , shoot 8+ fps sensor size equivalent 35mm film . meantime i shall learn shoot raw files post process . also incidentally , sensor size eos20d smaller , which means although itself lighter than eos1d series camera , carry around extrawide lens not my idea fun holiday . magnification ratio eos1dii 1.3 whereas eos20d 1.6 . this means i could still travel reasonably light ( compromise ) 1dii 28-135mm lens attached . sure it possible use stitching but more time spent computer time precious . any regrets ? none what-so-ever . it state technology moment . benefit using digital , it doesn't matter if you shooting iso 100 all day . come night if you want shoot rig moon backdrop , just change iso 1600 without bother " pushing2 film developing . it beauty when lens attached . you'd need when there machinery vibrations ship moving swell ! good job canon . now you need shoe horn more capable cpu ( process images in-camera ) , fit 1dsii sensor into this one or this motordrive into 1dsii you may persuade me part more cash .	1
this wonderful lens great image quality , very fast , very good build quality . no complaints	1
many great things already said this lens , i support them ! my copy delivers outstanding sharpness ( nearly par my 24-70l ) even * wide open * ( rare wide angle all but finest german manufacturers ) , great color , very little distortion ( many objective tests revealed it probably " best breed " ultra wide angle ) , impressive contrast . surprisingly , build quality not bad : tight fitting mount , damped rings , no jiggles or rattles . if i forced offer ( slight ) negative , it would bokeh lens somewhat " marbly " ... however , when shooting subject oof area differential high enough make bokeh component frame , then subject likely going demand far more attention than bokeh ! ;) fine lens , canon : definitely worth premium over sigma tokina rivals ( both which i sampled before purchasing this optic )	1
this original equipment battery charger manufactered canon . performance charger excellent most canon products . price paid comparible non-sale priced items puchased via internet sites . item recieved original packaging , 3 days after placing order , new ( not reconditioned new appearance ) . i am extremely pleased entire purchase process experienced , information given site ease ordering fast shipping	1
this great camera takes place earlier canon digital elph i lost several years ago . 7.1 megapixels ensures great quality 3x zoom provides crisp clear pictures . fact digital zoom also works great - just make sure camera steady ( i purchased nice compact monopod results awesome ) . although image stabilization feature newer models would great , you can't beat price overall quality this camera pictures it takes . canon sd500 great little camera	1
power-2000 xp-333 charges batteries pairs , one led per pair , not described . xp-555 charges each battery independently slightly faster ( 3 vs 4 hours ) . xp-333 charger very lightweight , xp-555 slightly heavier . they work 110 or 220 includes plug adaptors round european type plugs . i used xp-333 usa overseas . power-2000 makes several other charger models well . xp-333 555 aas 2500 mah , there xp-33327 xp-55527 versions now available 2700 mah batteries . aaa batteries charge faster they hold less charge . aaas power-2000 currently come 850 1000 mah capacities . i believe these capacities aa aaa power-2000 other nimh makers twice great or maybe more than alkalines . i recall , some years ago duracell copper top aas 1100 mah . i not found recent figures web , but got old figure calling 800 number duracell packages . duracell ultras appear bit higher mah figure , but i not know . 1.2 nimh vs 1.5 alkalines seems make no practical difference i am told , i believe it correct , alkaline voltage drops rapidly under 1.5 after initial use while i understand nimh holds its 1.2 value some time .	1
i'm new digital slr world . i using built flash my rebel xt . built-in flash alright , but nothing write home . since i spent most my money camera , i needed flash both affordable would get job . this flash met both requirements . if you advance user , you want higher end flash because flash limited adjuastable features . yet , if you newbie like me , this flash great ! it improved my picture quality dramaticly .	1
i bought this camera owning 2 more digital cameras . one kodak canon ( a70 ) . amazing product ... pro ... almost everything .. cons ... no audio videoi definetly recommend product price	1
it extremely easy use . hard figure out menu , but once there no problem . takes beautiful pictures . great action shots well . seldom find blurry photo it stabelizer built	1
i owned this camera two months now taken 100 photographs ( keepers ) date . because i involved photography almost 35 years , i developed certain prejudices . particular , i never comfortable auto exposure even less comfortable auto focus . fact , last auto focus camera i owned nikon n8008s i ultimately sold auction because i could not adapt using various auto settings . however , i like this camera . why ? d70s very easy camera use i only refer manual check couple settings look up some features . honestly , set up takes only few minutes handling not terribly different film camera . i should point out this camera really designed auto focus lenses if you choose use your manual focus lot , you disable many camera features . because i am both stubborn cheap ( but mostly only when it comes spending money myself ) i am using my manual focus lenses this camera . it true i not get any internal exposure meter readings must rely handheld gossen or sunny 16 rule ( quite effective , really ) exposure determination . lcd preview screen thus critical determining or adjusting exposure . i should also point out depth field preview feature also lost when using manual focus lenses . i stunned when i could not stop my lens down burrowed through manual find out what i doing wrong -- which nothing except i using wrong type lens . while i really miss this feature , i am not sure how big loss it really because viewfinder . others made mention low magnification tunnel like views through finder i attest this fact . i compared finder views my trusty old fm just stunned how poorly d70 compared . ultimately best camera camera you use d70 become my camera choice . even though i am using this camera like vintage series leica -- i.e. , handheld meter presetting exposure anticipation photograph -- i find i live this level usability . some point i probably buy auto focus lens ( maybe 35 f2 ) make full use feature set . but now i content using camera old fashioned way	1
there no professionals or would-be professional photographers our house . instead we ametuers who love get fun shots our friends family . we're not particularly interested birds , flowers , bugs , race cars , etc . we want catch our kids doing what they love best ; football , basketball , swimming , band , golf ... my only advantage i am very experienced adobe photoshop , which lets me creatively salvage some less-than-perfect shots . this year our son high-school senior . instead buying expensive portrait package , we voted spend money canon digital rebel xt kit ( lens ) . we choose one extra zoom lense ( 75-300mm f4- 5.6 iii usm telephoto ) up-close action sports shots . we didn't chose lens because it out our price range . we great fun this camera lens . we already taken variety football game pictures using ' basic ' sports setting camera ( burst mode full zoom ) . they great - crisp clear . these taken full sun . we realize we'll get little more creative when we taking pictures lower light situations . but i think we it . i would recommend this lens anyone who just wants capture some fun shots . they might not professional quality , but they just what we wanted	1
fast delivery , great price . i would buy them again , thanks =	1
i've bought several lenses adorama , two which include new 300/ 2.8 other , this 500/4 . all their deliveries prompt well packed . i zero complaints them . i dealt john ( green , i think his last name ) via email . i highly recommend them . this lens , it incredible . wide open it creates wickedly sharp subject against wonderfully soft background ( good bokeh ) . af very fast . this lens extremely good still af when used 1.4 converter . ( af works up 5.6 .	1
i able scout out different case options my sony dsc-n1 . after much review , i asked my wife her opinion she picked lcs-nb . it holds camera nice snug but you could work memory stick or battery . so far , so good	1
i this bag year recommend it . i use it all time . it great walkaround bag . first time you're place where you want get your camera quickly or don't want put your bag down you'll appreciate sling design . just aware long mountain hike you may feel weight your shoulder after some time . my only error getting 100 - i should gone 200 , plan so . i like keep my lens hood place which requires little more room . i'd also found i need little more room non-camera things . word all-weather cover - great feature . few weeks ago i bermuda walked beach 25 minutes away . just i arrived soaking rain began didn't let up entire walk back . if i hadn't able pull cover my equipment would soaked . now i wouldn't buy bag without one	1
i use it my nikon d70 , am very satisfied it . i most often use it long exposures , taking picture include myself , taking pictures my 6-month old daughter , who stops acting naturally when she notices i hold camera , so i place it tripod , take pictures her .	1
after way too much time infront pc reading reviews or camera store counter ( damn i sick it ) , this d80 what i chose . bought it 2 weeks ago then went 10 day trip west . after draging it everywhere i not let me down . price its perfect . i'm still working out exactly how make it work its potential aswell fighting understanding other manufacturers camera layouts my head ) work i rebel xt i bought last year i need its compact casing . my brother canon d30 after he progressed xt friend west coast d200 . experience both i still love what i chose . my biggest reason however going again nikon i already n6006 film camera lens my hope i could use its nikkor af 35-105mm this camera give myself more options . after reading lots reviews whether this possible finally taking lens shop i found it worked fine . experience field last 10 days shown it not work seemlessly buy may well me not lens . 2.5 inch lcd sooo much easier read than rebel xt . info read out top much better placed than one above lcd xt ( if obstructed architectural model shoot i can't see through viewfinder myself , i certainly can't see info screen if its below it ) . i didn't go 18-135 end lens there vinyetting issue high end which bothered me . i got great deal same price cameraland new hampshire d80 ( d70s ) 18-70mm tried trusted lens . fab . now need save up wait release 80-300 vr lens thats coming out . would love 80-400 vr but its 3 times price . my hardest time finiding someone it stock , price i wanted pay , set up i wanted who wasn't trying make dodgie deal ( like some those cheap web based places nyc ) . it really hardest part purchase end . i surprised . many people almost reluctant make sale . it wierd . parts hard get too apparently like spare battery very few places 18-135 lens instock either . anyway enjoy your purchase if you choose this camera . i hope it takes many great pictures you .	1
this one best bargains i've seen , " essentially " you get 3 filters price one . image quality these filters great , 812 ( warming ) filter far favorite giving back color richness flash photography so often washes out , unless you patience constantly tweaking your flash power . aside 812 uv protector basically clear protective filter . while it obviously advantages over clear glass , i tend not think it any different . this too great filter which i use half time because it doesn't affect color hues or change stop values too greatly while it takes worry out carrying camera around ready any candid shots may occur . finally included circular polarizer . this filter adjusts amount uv light entering camera spinning filter direction uv rays entering ( or turning thingy till things look better ) . this lens great sunny days take surface glare off lakes glass making them transparent again . it also makes colors more crisp general when photographing buildings other large " reflective " man-made things . so things sound great so far , but now why i only give this item 4 stars . while tiffen known one best photo video filters , they quality control issues no live up thier reputation . my case 812 filter arrived discoloration glass . while it didn't hurt image quality , flaw towards edge filter , i none less didn't want find situation which flaw would diminish quality . seeing it not amazon fault my first e-mail went tiffen replacement which they said they would gladly , but only after i send them filter they recieve it would they ship my replacement ( not option my circumstances ) . instead amazon wonderful customer service shown through again , within 3 days they replaced entire set . second set arrivided without flaw but since my other two filters perfect condition i traded just 812 . i havn't any other issues i'm very satisfied my filters . only other word warning would circular polorizer . while i recieved 2 flawless occassionally i read reviews customers received ones assembled backwards making lens useless . quick way check see if your cp working correctly hold it , thread facing yourself , look lcd monitor or tv spin it until picture dissapears(obviously working correctly ) . i still wouldn't pass up this deal knowing what i now , chances everything show up perfectly but none less if you're concerned order it before you need it check everything over carefully . amazon always best returns often ship replacement next day overnight shipping	1
i searched researched lens purchase my canon rebel xti weeks because i knew i not want kit lens . i also not money spend 5 , 6 , or $700 dollar lens . end after reading countless reviews , ones implementing professional techniques ones using just opinion , this lens looked best value . money i really don't think you beat this lens . it focuses quickly , it really quiet while doing it , it sharp enough money . plus it full time manual focus , which really big plus lens this price range . only problem it little narrow side 1.6 crop factor rebel xti , but i would much rather deal than sub-par image . summary i would recommend this lens place kit lens anyone who doesn't money buy " " series lens . it really great value	1
this one fantastic flash . i it my canon a2e four years , ambivilent , but if you match this lens one canon newer bodies funcionality access all 550ex features , you awesome , powerful , flexable flash change way you shoot	1
this isn't full review but some thoughts i've after using it long time . stabilization- fact if this camera you take everywhere you , you going either lose shots or use flash . if flash doesn't bother you , no sweat . but i've never like look it . ease-of-use- great . voice memo- i use this feature all time . it would nice if it pause button because without it i end up many small files . ex- this where you set exposure . casio great job putting everything one place . only thing they should better if you changed selection ( e.g. iso 200 400 ) hit shutter release it should take shot . instead nothing happens . you click set first . it extra step you make during critical time	1
its time price ( time ) , fantastic camera . 6.3 mp more than sufficient most amateur semi-pro ( non-studio ) work , this camera works very well what really matters : canon fantastic lenses . battery life this camera very good . " shutter lag " ( when you depress button when camera actually takes photo ) fairly well non-existent , only real lag i when i am shooting multiple photos raw format . most photographers know , lens almost more important than body , outside leica lenses , i don't think anything really competes canon line . 18-55 lens comes this camera sufficient casual work ... i used it beach , hikes my dog , when i don't want lug around my bigger , more expensive , higher-quality lenses . but $75 or so , you 50mm 1.8 eos lens , which supplement 18-55 nicely , particularly night photography . my one complaint this camera its ability meter light adequately dark settings . when i shoot raw this isn't such big problem , because i fix it photoshop , but most everything i shoot inside , unless i manually mess white balance every time , orange tint interesting first 200 shots , then annoying after . i think more advanced eos models come out since 2004 or so fix this color problem , also help bit lag raw shots ... but money , this camera excellent , far , far superior , example , olympus ' digital exquivalent ( similar price ) . difference , far i'm concerned , absolute advantage canon lens quality . you use high-end consumer body like this one , use professional piece canon glass ( lens ) take excellent photos . i wouldn't invest system doesn't also boast excellent lens quality	1
this camera amazing . out 3 digital camera under $150 i've used , this far best , beating out kodak sipix . i originally bought sipix , it junk . don't buy sipix that under $150 . kodak some reason didn't seem like it took good pictures finepix , but software little better , kodak . this camera take pictures resolution up 2 megapixels , but i don't even use option because 1 megapixel pictures so amazing . it comes 16mb removable memory card , so you take around 49 pics 1mp , around 24 2mp , it takes short videos 30 seconds mpeg format 320 160 resolution , or more lower setting . lcd screen easily turned or off save battery power , 2 aa batteries it takes lasts pretty long . it nice , sleak design , software no issues windows xp least . only cons i could think only zoom it 2x digital zoom , which pretty much useless , i never use it , since it same thing zooming your picture viewer your computer . so you consider it not any zoom . software it works well , but it could better , options wise . filenames pictures default number depending its order memory card , so if you transfer pics your computer more than once day ( since it creates folders based date ) , you'll rename each pic . but i hardly complain , since pictures come out so incredibly well . i'm so happy this camera ! if you want camera under $150 , this one get . don't even waste your time kodak , unless you want one 3x optical zoom , but that $200 . i use it general purpose , taking pictures freinds such . once while i take picture sunset 2mp , photo quality printed full page . 1mp creates crisp clear desktop wallpaper size images , . 3mp created good smaller images put websites . there no reason buy anything else , go fuji finepix a200 !	1
i highly recommend raynox dcr 1540pro teleconverter canon s2 instead canon branded one . hoya makes 67mm uv filter this both available lensmate.com . canon wc-dc58a wide angle converter however really good . tiffen made better one but it seems not available anymore . way , function s2 provides settings using lens adaptors teleconvertors adjust autofocus function camera necessary unless you wish try focus yourself using manual focus which , my mind , because lcd both screen well viewfinder lower resolution than optical viewfinder , iffy best . trust camera ..... it really excellent job . one final note , i would recommend using focus bracketing option lower light situations auto focus weak those situations .	1
this tripod total shock ! i amazed quality , stability portability . heavy duty denier carrying case great bonus . level quick release also welcome surprise . this best $9.00 i ever spent photography accessories .	1
great flash , all good qualities sb800 but less data dump decision quagmire ! it built flash disperser , its lighter than 800 , so unless you're into more info than you need , go sb600 . oh , it shorter recycle time too .	1
this lens ok magnifying 2x max . full zoom , magnification not sharp without close-up lens	1
well , besides whole bucket full money , one them lets you take photos lower light , okay , that obvious . 16-35mm bit heavier , but not so you'd notice , unless maybe you carrying it around all day , without eating you're bit over hill . so why pay extra money , unless , course , you lot shooting early morning late evening ? maybe you shouldn't , because i've doing lot photo taking both , film digital , one would expect " " lenses , photos crisp sharp . fact i keep i 17-40 camera i carry around all day , you know , one i might leave table restaurant when i got restroom . it lot less money lose someone looking five finger discount . however , my gal pal sara i take lot early morning photos . she shoots old houses , she never , ever goes out without 16-35mm . she swears it , loves it , sometimes i think better than me . so there difference , i'm kind person could happily live less expensive lense , sara not . however they both deliver gorgeous photos . you can't go wrong if lense red circle around it . jack priest , sailor home se	1
this first slr camera i ever owned . i bought it because i going trip around world , wanted nice camera , it recommended camera shop owner . it extremely easy use , so easy i could hand camera someone one countries i visited , point button they needed push i ended up great picture . i didn't need explain thing . i also didn't mind carrying it around all day , it very light its size . i owned camera four years now it still takes beautiful pictures . i taken all sorts pictures this camera , landscapes action shots they all turn out great . action shots never blurry ! only complaint i autofocus not work well low lighting , sometimes it slow sometimes it won't work all . these cases i just turn manual focus option . all options camera great , but honest i rarely use them . i've found it often easier use manual focus than adjust camera so it autofocus off center . if i know i'm going taking action shots or landscapes i set camera mode , but often i forget my pictures still look great . i think this excellent camera , especially someone used point shoot but wants extra quality slr camera give them . there also many choices when it comes additional lenses , so when photography bug gets you , this camera stay you	1
fisheye lens lot fun , i enjoy using mine . however , i find practicality lens minimal . i don't usually want my " serious " photographs fisheye distortion . i don't tend like 1.6 crop canon lower-end digital slr cameras , but fisheye this interesting benefit : it reasonably easy use fisheye standard wide-angle lens , since most distortion removed 1.6 crop . you still get distortion , but it lot easier compose shot without it using 1.6 camera than full-frame camera . either way , lots fun . buy one enjoyment , or even professional assignments if your work calls it , but think if you really want distortion before getting one these	1
fits my canon sd550 perfectly no complains abt . quality product pretty good . when used belt clip , its easy open easy put camera back . camera seems very secured when used belt clip .	1
if you looking great all around camera , this it ! our kids play sports constant motion sports mode captures it all . also love " last 4 " feature , gets some great action shots . we fuji 7000 before this they definately fixed features bugged me . love new manual zoom ( if you like 35mm lenses your like this ) well battery drain . i used replace batteries every day , now its more like once week amount we use it . my other favorite feature dual memory slots those times where i forget put it back camera after downloading ! so there always one there !. video comes out great new manual lens you zoom during video shots . general , without spending lot more , you get great camera keeps up active " picture happy " family	1
it seems surprising canon would make product out anything but best materials . lensmate makes superior product out aluminum black silver	1
i bought this camera my sister , early christmas present , thinking i would need some time set it up her , well less then 30 minutes i ready , it awesome camera , i impressed , ease set up formatting 512 sd card . i sent site sister whom interested . it easiest camera use features impress anyone , great photos very close far away . i would recommend this camera anyone	1
item exactly expected . packaging shipment , other item i ordered , unacceptable . child could better	1
this kit must any compatible canon cameras . digital camera rule #1 : always carry spare battery - kit almost worth it alone . leather case great : stylish looks provides tough protective armor case you drop camera . neck strap quite strong looks good too . it may not everyone cup tea but i like it . it comes handy when i need quick access camera don't want fumble through pockets or bags	1
now i this my camera while now , my camera feels so weird it off , i love grip it gives extra battery life great those all day shooting events i go . i wish buttons same plastic/chrome color ones camera but its well built product works fine so i cant complain	1

i am 67 years old started out photography kid contact printer box camera . i all types cameras over years , mostly 35mm film canon slr . i too bought all sorts these 5-7 mp point shoot digital cameras before returning my true love , slr . i my digital canon rebel xt month now i can't keep my hands off it . it lacks nothing . although kit lense good , i bought 28-135 canon zoom lense image stabilizion produced stunning photo it . i love way you use 7 points focus , i mainly use only center point focus lock never get out focus picture . i guess nicest thing me i now don't urge buy every point shoot camera paraded out qvc or hsn " wonderful " new feature like " low light or non-shake . " this canon every good feature known universe you can't outgrow it . its camera let you good you , it won't hold you back . battery life great , built flash good but i bought 430ex that even better . i never figure i'm wasting money buying accessories this camera it my main squeeze many years come . i always missed my 35mm canon slr now feel i old friend back again , only much much better . believe me , you can't go wrong getting this camera , its beyond description ...	1
this great camera . plenty resolution . excellent shot speed . sturdy frame . kit lense doesn't camera justice . buy body separate add better lense . bad side , i small glitch camera firmware soon after purchase return it fix . it two months before camera returned . sorry , canon ... you lose star	1
i bought this flash use my canon rebel xt . first thing i noticed without even reading instructions i able get much better results pictures taken indoors . able bounce flash off white ceilings provided much better color contrasts built flash . even when i set my camera shoot quick pictures succession flash not let me down . it not need anytime recharge all . i recently just came back vacation took lot outdoor evening shots . most pictures came back great results . only dissappointment i when taking shots further distance than i normally would , pictures came back darker than i would've liked . so , compensate this i adjusted flash exposure my camera although it improvement it hassle taking several test shots before getting it right . problem i flash battery cover . it flimsy i find it awkward open close times . i always feel like i'm gonna snap it off accident . overall i am happy . it good flash price you pay . battery life good . i still haven't even recharge batteries i've almost taken 200 shots it . my low light picture improved dramatically investing external flash . anyone decent camera should never use built flash . difference night day	1
70-200 f/4 loved it pieces d60 , now 1d mkii , but sold 4.0 order pay 35-350 , which my work horse . due push pull feature however , 35-350 gets dusty quick good ol ' montana land , so it go cleanings every once while , f/stop isn't always desirable certain situations . 70-200 f/ 2.8 amazing . twist zoom little close camera , so it takes some twisting wrist get it where you need it , imho , bit too much turn 70 200 time one might need extreme sports . ( rodeo , nascar etc ) clarity this piece glass just blew me away . i comparison images my 70-200 f/4 when it new , 2.8 still visibly sharper . i put expensive filter it , my equipment asked lot very harmful conditions , i notice slightest big distortion filter , even though it good bw ..... so when i , i shoot lens no filter if i require extreme detail . 35-350l nowhere near quality this little 2.8 ... if it weren't difference distance , this lens would my one only . oh , i love . it my first lens , i treasure , but know i not buy distance lens without it	1
i purchased this tripod 47th street photo through amazon.com . tripod appeared arrive good shape , except operating instructions not included . i immediately emailed 47th stree photo customer service address printed flyer they included my shipment . i asked them if they would able send me copy operating instructions . they not respond my email , so few days later i emailed them again . once again , no response . i then emailed amazon.com, informed them missing instructions non-responses 47th street photo . no response amazon either ! far tripod goes , it appears very good value money . i gave it 4 rather than 5 stars because , due missing operating instructions , i cannot certain i properly checked out all its features . however , i am certain both 47th street photo amazon.com rate zero stars customer service . i use neither one again	1
this replacement identical battery pack i lost . works great , long life , no problems	1
excellent choice make great job .	1
this my first time purchase battery grip digital slr camera it good investment . i don't worry running out battery power same time it works vertical grip my camera . it also looks nice my canon 30d camera , coupled " " series zoom lens	1
over years i using quantum turbo later 2x2 units ( no turbo sc yet ) power various canon speed-lights 540ez ex580 . some skepticism i picked this unit trial one wedding assignment . well , although quantum units still place my kit power metz unit , i love convenience cp-e3 . one recommendation . buy couple extra battery inserts , if you lot fast shootings , keep them loaded good quality duracell nimh 	1
this best item i ever bought my camera . i lot walking my camera , thought i would use it walking stick , which i , but best part this monopod what i never thought would happen . my pictures never fuzzy ! i take low light photos they come out clear . i paid very little this item would never caught without it my camera . three levers bottom allow quick expansion all different lengths . carrying case allows this item packed next my camera without it getting scratched	1
new nikon en-el3e battery slight update nikon en-el3 provided earlier dslr models such d70 . it adds contact allows new cameras determine how much charge left battery . battery grey distinguish it black en-el3 . en-el3e backwards compatible en-el3 : you put it your d70 or d50 . reverse not true . number pictures battery gives you depends lot factors , including shooting style , lcd usage , course , camera . ( 2.5 " lcd d200 use up battery much quicker than smaller d70 . ) it sufficient day shooting . unless you using d200 some professional capacity , which case , you'll probably investing least one backup battery	1
case great ! it fits camera perfectly exactly what i expected receive when ordering . price right but shipping little higher than i expected	1
i purchased this lens my canon eos 20d digital camera so far i really like it . it focuses fast produces very sharp , clear images . any longer lens you careful camera shake ; i've few images come out blurry but these usually interior shots . i really like 28-200mm focal length range find lens very versatile framing wide shots buildings or landscapes zoomed shots portraits or close detail shots . lens feels solid appears well constructed , which typical canon products . price range , this excellent lens . you only better spending considerable more money lens	1
digital rebel most amazing camera i've ever owned . my previous camera canon a90 i loved using all features it [ great camera ! ] . i decided recently maybe i should graduate slr because i starting get more creative my photography . i spent great deal time researching cameras finally decided digital rebel . after few months owning it i still am amazed . image quality fantastic , it quick responsive , every day using it i learn little more . it perfect intro slr camera me because everything makes sense it easy learn . i've gotten amazing shots i could never dream getting point shoot . if you finding yourself wanting little more than point shoot , go this camera , you wont sorry .	1
np-bg1 type lith pack good picture life , but i'd carry spare if your going use your cameras movie feature	1
this excellent device . quick respond my d80 . i use it take family pictures include me . i just point press this remote activate d80 timer it works beautifully	1
after using both lenses i think this much better . here my reasons : 1- 2.8 makes autofocus much faster accurate . 2- bokeh much better this one . 3- macro slightly better this one . 4- 105 mm make very little difference image size . 5- not very crucial 24-50 range .	1
i am not much photographer . i found this camera easy use my pix just great . believe me , it camera . stabilizer thing works give clear focus almost every time . i even put pix up computer send them easily . i'm thrilled . you need upgrade 1 mgb . memory card when you buy camera .	1
i bought this filter my 28-135 canon lens so far it worked out great . unlike some other tiffen filters i bought , this one fits just right lens . all sides even it sits flush against lens . i haven't noticed any artifacts pictures i've taken yet , but i haven't really much chance take many pictures lens . night shots i've take so far , i've quite pleased , however	1
i wanted buy compact slim d-camera . those larger zoom quite bulky , you can't carry around all time . i think slim camera better choice . i slip into my pocket while wondering around come across something nice take picture it . you can't it huge camera . after i made up mind slim camera , my choices either casio exilim or sony dscw series . casio exilims very sexy . they lot mode scenes . they also function voice recorder . you take pictures book pages etc . they anti-shake capability which said reduce blurred images . i almost buying casio exilim . diligent person i wanted search more more . i found out so-called anti-shake feature bogus . many people found it useless . good reason choose casio . then i found picture quality exilim not really good . i found some pictures taken exilim . they soft , not crisp colors . search web reviews made photo professionals . casio exilim rated significantly less than sony picture quality . iso 200 noise still detectable most reviews . those same reviewers however found sony dscw doing better job . there no noise iso 400 which means even lower light condition sony better job ( less granularity pictures low light ) . big difference !. one feature sony made it very attractive its strong macro . it 0.74 inch which means you bring your camera 0.74 inch ( 2 mm ) close object ( say bug ) still take brilliant picture it . now comparison exilim sony summarize : casio exilimanti-shake ( it bogus)slim lower macro ( 2.5 inches)lower picture quality ( detectable noise iso 200)a lot scene modesquick shuttersony dscw seriesslim ( fact it slimmer)higher macro ( 0.74 inches)higher picture quality ( no noise iso 400)not lot scene modesquick shutterso ..... i purchased sony dscw 7 mp . i took lots pictures . they all brilliant , detailed crisp , true colors . i tried macro took pictures bugs . you see hairs legs bugs . absolutely no noise whatsoever , no blurry . it marvel technology . i took pictures fireworks july 4th using high iso setting . they came out brialliantly like professional pictures . it also uses different kind battery you can't buy your grocery which leave you vulnerable . so you may wanna buy spare one ( 40 bucks ) . but you always recharge it . it lasts much much longer than aaa or nimh batteries . it perfect choice . i highly recommend it .	1
i own several canon lens my 20d this hands down best . i 28-135 which very good lens regardless some reviews , i got many excellent photos it - this distinctly better all ways . ( course , it costs lot more ) . recently went grandchildred sea world i got 100% good photos , several really outstanding ones . it light , accurate - what more you want ? you replace slew lens this one perhaps selling old ones help pay it . bought it soon it available not regretted it one moment . if you one lens , this one	1
this camera steal . reviews amazon helped me decide this camera sure it worth it .	1
after checking prices all usual pricing bots , i found better price , including free shipping , going directly amazon . this lowest price not appear other searches , so it pays go amazon first . i replaced my canon sd400 casio find controls more logical use . this important if you don't use camera while , because you just pick it up start shooting without hunting manual . also , docking base much more convenient than plugging small cables into camera . you not remove battery casio charge it you canon sd400 . vga movie quality superior casio . still pictures appear equal . amazon delivered ups record time even weekend inbetween . i ordered friday received it following tuesday . go amazon !	1
i 5 digital point shoot cameras all little bigger better than last . this my first slr i am not least disappointed . this camera meets or exceeded everything i expected it . very easy learn , read manual use web site tuturial when battery charged your ready go take pictures . i highly recommend this camera	1
wow all there say no problems it perfect casual picture take	1
i've this camera 1 1/2 years now it tried true companion . i've easily taken over 10,000 shots it produced some really exceptional photographs . features really set this camera apart 12x zoom , image stabilization ( must such large zoom ) , rotating screen ( great if you want take picture yourself :)) . i also love macro mode , i've gotten some great quality close-ups . most situations you just stick it auto mode get great results , but different scene modes fun play well . performs extremely well outdoors -- wildlife , sports , landscape , beach , etc . my only real complaint its performance low-light situations . pictures grainy camera very slow respond , sometimes not responding all . also it eat through batteries fairly quickly -- regular aa batteries lasted me 2.5 hours continuous shooting ( around 200 pictures ) or less if i shooting cold weather . i would definately recommend rechargable batteries . overall i've really enjoyed this camera . i've used abused it apart low-light situations ( which i rarely anyway ) it never let me down . both my grandmother my great aunt bought one within past 6 months they rave it	1
this camera really great . i knew i liked it before , but i immediately began appreciate this camera all more when i ended up rebel xt " loaner " while my 20d repair . not xt bad camera , it just doesn't really compare 20d . 20d nice feel it ; it fairly large , which great since i somewhat large hands . features great too . image quality awesome . i don't really need go into all details , most other reviewers excellent job . let me just say it great camera worth five stars . only complaint i camera it doesn't spot metering . ability your light metering off single point interest would great - they add it 30d .	1
i used this lens over 6 months now over 1k shots through it . it fantastic others note herein . 2.8 through focus range really great . superb . vr function really neat trick . it super fun play . drawbacks size weight . after 1/2 hour shooting , your arms get tired . remember careful hold lens not camera . this lens definately heavy enough bend/warp camera body	1
this gadget must-have gadget lovers ..... picture lovers . it compact , solid fits any small pocket or clutch bag . images crisp if you get it set appropriately . if you love attention get this product if you don't ..... not worry camera gets all it .	1
it gave me option change angle light ... this nice option i am sure	1
this camera simply amazing ! i started out canon g2 , then canon g6 , then canon 20d , now this canon 1d mark ii . i debated researched 3 months 1ds mark ii , 5d , 30d . my decision primarily narrowed down 5d this 1d mark ii . yes , i wish this camera full-frame also shared 12.8 mp like 5d , but you know what ? it practically killed me trying weigh pros cons finally i made my decision go this one i'm 110% glad i . me , this camera definitely one get because 45 point focusing , 8.5 fps , 1d pro body/interface/menu/layout , etc what really makes this camera worth it deciding factor . trust me , if you don't know how seriously fast 8.5 fps really , you need go out your camera store try it out before you decide . because this 8.5 fps alone , i'm actually able capture lot shots i normally get lucky getting my 20d . 5d 3fps , i just said forget it ... no way . i'm not even professional taking pictures living . this just purely fun hobby me stepping up 20d this camera out this world . phenomenal auto focusing , additional metering , it like i'm now playing bentley ( 1d mk2 ) coming mercedes c230 hatchback ( cheapest mercedes people buy just because it mercedes name they don't want spend any more money real mercedes ) . this camera photos truly almost help me take pictures like pro . also , i don't shoot action pictures all time , i love portrait photography , landscapes printing blowing up large sized pictures . but even 1.3 crop factor , there still huge improved difference going 1.6 crop you won't vignetting problems some lenses you'll 5d . this 1d mk2 , you still take wonderful wedding photography , landscapes , etc . much i'd like 12.8 mp like 5d , 8mp really all we need these days unless you're going blow up print photos larger than 8x10 or around there . unless you're printing extremely large posters whatnot , you pretty much everything this camera 5d . resolution mp definitely enough . plus , it also invaluable know you 8.5 fps available ready use if you need you also tone it down use slower fps if you need . extra bonuses this camera which i look secondary positive , weather seals , pro-build high quality construction body , easy use navigate menu system , you see iso information viewfinder well lcd screen all times , dual memory card capability , you shoot 2 memory cards same time one backup or use 2 separate cards independently , built-in battery grip ( you don't shell out extra this ) , longer battery life than other cameras , best customization most options you set your liking , more than 5d or 20d or 30d . i could go but definitely get this camera if you afford it . otherwise , 5d also great choice too if you need save money , all you take landscape pictures all day long , or never use fast action or need capture quick moments , don't want fast most accurate focusing system that great ai servo .	1
up front : if you're considering this lens , stop considering - buy it . i occasion try tamaron zoom this range noticed plastic-y digital qualities some tamaron highlighted-texture areas . none problem this canon beauty . i am using it my normal lens . contrast razor-sharp enough shave . it graphic monochrome colors pure leap off monitor like politician attracted tv camera . it also light weight plenty fast enough practically no spherical abs .... tiny problems include understandable perspective bulging subjects edges . there some blue fringing very high contrast edges . photoshop nails latter dead'er than britney spears ' career . i've need reasonably large blow-ups , most captures cropped , yet still enlarged up prints minimally 13x20 . size not only this lens reproduce subject pores , but you peer down see stuff inside craters .	1
digital rebel most amazing camera i've ever owned . my previous camera canon a90 i loved using all features it [ great camera ! ] . i decided recently maybe i should graduate slr because i starting get more creative my photography . i spent great deal time researching cameras finally decided digital rebel . after few months owning it i still am amazed . image quality fantastic , it quick responsive , every day using it i learn little more . it perfect intro slr camera me because everything makes sense it easy learn . i've gotten amazing shots i could never dream getting point shoot . if you finding yourself wanting little more than point shoot , go this camera , you wont sorry .	1
canon makes great underwater housing reasonable price . i purchased this recent trip grand cayman cozumel . i didn't go scuba diving this trip , but i take camera snorkeling ( diving depths ~ 20ft ) . it worked flawlessly i got some pictures i very happy ! one thing i not anticipate use camera got out water . going ac hot humid outdoors , my eos rebel fogged up ( condensation ) even after 30 minutes i couldn't take good pictures . sd110 uw housing , i just wipped housing glass portal lens tissue after it warmed up couple minutes i able take clear pictures . instructions pretty good , but it took me while figure out how take out o-ring seal cleaning/lubing . once i figured it out , it wasn't so hard . sd110 may getting little old , but it still takes decent pictures even housing i don't so much money tied up system i would devestated if it lost or stolen . i probably upgrade sd550 or sd500 ( they both use same batteries sd110 ) wp-dc80 or wp-dc70 housing some time near future , but i definitely keep sd110 wp-dc10 backups	1
nice quality , but overpriced . nice job protecting front lens , reducing glare some situations	1
i bought one these my canon sd-800 recommend it . many years now , i've carried canon pocket cameras my belt while traveling canon-branded cases simply best this purpose . my only criticism canon cases their lack small pocket media . i hoping tiny size sd cards canon would added such pocket their newer cases , but they haven't . plus side , case retains superior leather construction , uses neat magnetic tie down flap instead velcro or snap , belt loop tight enough hold camera comfortably against your body . package also includes nice looking leather replacement strap your camera . incidentally , sd-800 well matched case , fitting quite securely	1
case pretty much what you see ... i no complaints . =) case protects my camera very well	1
i weddings , portrait , outdoor photography i don't see any reason why i'd ever switch d70 ( other than d80 :) . this camera professional grade consumer price point . don't scared 6.1 mp . i print 20x30 all time w/ out any problems . i'd recommend reading thom hogans manual	1
i'm using it few months now ; i haven't found single problem so far . earlier , i using old finepix optic/sensor sensitivity not very good ; poor quality photos taken dark environment . this not problem any more . also , i impressed sharpness photos sport actions taken 10x zoom . general , i pretty enthusiastic all features this camera ; it took me nearly 3 days try everything out :-) . sure , there better cameras market ; however , considering price it just great deal	1
quality definitely great . when attached s3 , it makes your camera look serious taking good shots . if you attaching hood doing flash photography , i suggest you use slave flash eliminate shadow caused hood	1
this fabulous reliable camera . feels solid . fantastic pictures . easy operate . new d40 announced over past few days , but its lack lcd display buttons manage basic camera controls ( reduce weight make it more user friendly ) would still make this my recommended nikon dslr . expect prices fall d40 becomes available	1
i honestly don't see why people would give this camera less than 4 stars . moment i got it , i delighted quality pictures ( except very dark places - which why review gets minus 1 star ) , its portability . i've dropped it , abused it , took it countless parties , countries it now full scratches bumps ( get camera case ! ) , guess what : it still works perfectly first day i got it . this little piece technology amazing , so if you're looking something affordable great picture quality ( us amateurs , course ) just go it . actually , i even took quite few gorgeous pictures it . i even love it rely it so much i won't change it even now it looks all messed up . don't think twice . just go it	1
all reviews i read , i expected certain pros cons this lens . i not disappointed . pros : very sharp lens very good colorscons : vignetting wide open , little too contrastyfor myself , pros outweighed cons price . it ideal 1.6 multiplier cameras , where it becomes 38mm lens	1
i upgraded canon digital rebel ( grey body ) this because i ready take my photography new level . one thing i like most this camera it flash compenstation . i purchased 430ex flash it because i tired use built flash always getting those hard shadows wall	1
battery great , but amazon offers accessory kit same battery , plus mini-dv tape carrying case same price . case useless zr series , but might come handy some other purpose	1
small compact . let me see everyting i wanted	1
i am really satisfied purchase this camera . good quality workmanship . canon leader photography my book . easy use controls any one	1
i received xacti few weeks ago it performing like i hoped it would . controls very simple intuitive . all required hardware included . not require any additional software run mac or windows . i macbook boot camp running windows xp pro . camera works easily either platform . it recognized drive not require any additional software download images movies onto hardrive . i am using sandisk 2gb sd memory card . big plus not wait while downloading real-time like you would minidv . quality may not same minidv but convenience ease use make up difference . quality much better than digital camera when taking movies people think it just camera it small size . my old camera 2 mega pixel canon powershot a60 . this rated 6 mega pixel . you definitely see difference pictures movies . when filming movies , higher frames per second sample rate makes images smooth , even when taking pictures high speed objects like helicopter rotor blades airplane propellers . this my first camcorder so i can't really compare anything else ( except my old camera ) but ease use make you want use it all time people start tell you put thing away	1
price paid , this great camera . should last me long time . debated buying slr , but this seems all features expensive slr ( actually it slr , just no interchangable lenses ) lot easier use	1

300 plus minutes recording time ( without lcd ) . i still got several hours lcd , backlight . when you out all day , this good long lasting battery . hdr-fx1 i found it preferable smaller lighter battery it helped provide touch extra rear weighting . helped balance when using camcorder hip height me . i can't say i noticed extra weight issue when using shoulder height , though i didn't it my shoulder long periods time	1
i purchased this camera shooting product photos our website . i using nikon coolpix 5mp wanted something relatively low cost higher mp next few years . we plan purchase something totally outlandish few years super-quality printed photos , but now , this camera excellent investment . easy small enough everyone company carry trips abroad , but inexpensive enough not break our hearts if pocket-picked or eaten hyena . i've read some reviews talk blurred photos ... i'm really surprised . i began using ours after i my son , so many photos taken without tripod , one hand holding nursing child other shooting photos ... none images turned out blurry . i taken few photos my son now he six-month-old super action hero look like cotton candy my nikon but turn out crystal clear sony . movie mode real plus . i'm actually this page today because i'm looking buy one these my personal use video recording mind . we digital video camera , but plenty 1g memory cards hand , i'd rather record action this camera -- quality sound worlds better . this lovely little low-cost camera that suitable wide range users . i love it	1
this thing great i just got it trip seattle hawaii . ( i know opposite ) but i afraid when i this default battery came my canon zr 500 . ( which only last 45 min . ) but this one last least 3 hours i love it . best buy my camera so far , completely worth $$$$	1

i purchased this camera so i could photograph wildlife hikes . i needed something not too heavy , image-stabilized , telephoto power . this camera meets all those requirements . it one problem , however . bright light , viewfinder blanks out , so one cannot clearly see object photographed . i solved problem some extent , pointing camera object , letting autofocus rest . this " fix " resulted many excellent photos . like many other small cameras , results tend contrasty , i modify this tendency photoshop	1
after week testing this camcorder , i found it good enough daily use . hd2 not come sd card , so make sure you buy one before or time you get hd2 . i got 2gb sd a-data 4gb sdhc qpi class6 . both worked fine . 4gb gives me 1:20 standardhd mode , 55mns superhd mode . i didn't notice speed difference class2 class6 sd card using hd2 , i think you should fine 8gb sdhc class2 . my first impression camera how small it , however it may not fit jean pocket . it turns very quick , you start filming within 2secs startup . it lady voice telling mode you using ( ie camera mode ) , not sure if this useful others , but not me . video still pictures great outdoor . video quality impressive during bright sunlight . room lighten 60w equivalent fluo light , video quality grainy/noisy , this confirmed other people well . high sensitivity feature ( boost image quality low light ) helps but not enough . my 7yrs old sony digital8 better job 1lux . i noticed video quality grainy low light , but 7mp still picture quality very good same lighting . compared my new canon sd800 7mp , it obvious canon digital camera wins . video side , i played several configuration , iso setting , white balance , resolution , etc ... it helps , but video still grainy low light . this camcorder not designed low light filming . i ran into issue when transfering video pictures hd2 its cradle pc via usb connection . i got errors transfering files if you use craddle ( this freeze hd2 ) . i am not sure why , i check sanyo this . if you connect hd2 directly pc ( without cradle ) , transfer goes smooth . so there issue cradle usb port . i am also using pinnacle studio 10.5 my video editing . so far , i not able use it control my hd2 . you however copy files sd your pc , use these files pinnacle studio . since i film most time outdoor during daytime , this camera job fine video quality great . i would still give 5 stars even video issues low light .	1
i am not professional photographer . i just happen grandson one . i use fully manual canon tx slr my work . so far i've shot 5 rolls this stuff . every time there something wrong camera/me/lighting . every time i got usable , sometimes , great print . this film huge exposure latitute ( you really screw up still get image ) when i show these prints others , they look me funny say , quot ; this iso 400 ? quot ; it really fine grain . because it iso 400 , you use it almost anything ( i got usable prints after shooting soccer game : my camera set iso 100 there light leaks camera door ) . it great film , although i'm told royal gold it replaces still better . pick up pack this see what you get . you'll amazed	1
very easy install ; great tool easily downloading photos computer removing camera ; would recommend anybody	1
this fabulous gift grandparents if you preload pictures . just aware customer support folks not knowledgeable , probably since product new . don't bypass their software load pix if you're transferring your pc frame - their software reduces memory needed each one . even though software different size frames labelled same , it not compatible you only one version installed your pc time	1
looked number cameras including tz3 , p5000 , few others . nothing compared g7 which one i ended up going ; , 6x lens , incredible quality , etc . if you want best camera out there don't feel like messing dslr , canon g7 league it own ~ benchmark which all other manufacturers strive towards .	1
excellent quality/price/speed delivery ... works expected ... would definately buy again , this vendor , if need ever arose .	1

i needed new camera replace my very old digital camera , so i ordered this one could not happier it . it all kinds features , including some manual control options like white balance , etc . those people who like mess stuff ( i'm more auto person , myself ) . i used it vacation last month pleasantly surprised quality pictures , after taking only few test shots get familiar camera . camera very easy use gives you basic user manual get you started , also detailed manual help you find out how everything works camera . movie mode works good , too . colors come out bright vivid . lag time pictures minimal , which one main things i hated my old 1.3 mp panasonic palmcam , 7.1 mp makes some excellent detail your pictures . only bad thing camera , my opinion , it doesn't movement stabilizer ( or whatever it called ) , so it prone shaking , especially when you zoom using digital zoom . i like camera small lightweight , but it not one those super thin ones you feel like you could break half . overall , i think this great camera , i don't think you find better camera price	1
outstanding service . product advertised . excellent packing job . arrived record time . would buy again this seller	1
i just got my new photo box today . i so excited i opened it work . then i took picture my wendy salad just see how it looked . quality pictures excellent(macro mode ) . light evenly distributed . caution lights : lights get really hot really fast . untouchable within 2min . after i turn them . i suggest shear sanctity safety , shut off lights object/scene changes . package arrived intact , box beat up little , nothing major . when i opened item , i noticed camera stand pierced nylon bottom . this could've bad/weak stitch , or may happened during shipping , but nothing major wrong , only . besides , i sew it ! overall , this great product , easy setup carry around . i'd definitely buy again	1

engaged 35mm photography 32 years , i approached digital photography great reluctance . i knew there would essential learning phase less than ideal pictures , like my playing brownie few years kid -- this further delayed my plunge . finally , upcoming trip overseas compounded knowledge what airport metal detectors film forced issue . my choice cinched some pictures we acquired friend papal conclave 2006 . we ran them screen saver , i much impressed sharpness , color tonality , depth field -- especially cloudy day pictures crowds public squares . faces far into background discernable . i asked what used it this camera . camera store i heartened see it felt like mini slr hand , nice big viewer uncomplicated , straightforward controls . learning phase backyard around town gave me some doubts . lack no-shake feature model biggest downside ; lot got blurred especially using zoom feature moving subjects . some this you learn shake out using point focus , but you still going lose few precious moments despite your best efforts . nor limited equivalent asa range you going able get sort pics museums or dark old cathedrals you used good slr high speed film -- but remember , this one starter . this thing monster battery eater , too : always carry 2 fully charged replacement sets you . plus side , choice black white chrome mode very nice feature , built-in zoom very decent range performance stationary subjects . speed use may or may not compare well other digitals , i don't know , but its whole world superior my old world . there rather steely patina even best color images , i see now after viewing hundreds , but that decent trade-off general ease use clarity . incidentally , lens this camera gives you lot more than what you would expect 4 megapixel rating . back europe this week , i 2000+ jpegs ( keepers ) all very high quality , achievement i could not come close , i am sure , either old film camera or most other starter level digitals . continuing issue shake blur i surmounted simply multiple shooting lot ( sometimes 5-7 images ); you erase them almost quickly you shoot them , come see this small nuisance bigger trade-off . i not plan spend rest my life this level digital camera , but even after i move up i think i keep it around sheer utilty ease use general every day world . price , this good deal one hope .	1

i got this bag under $15 it worth every penny . it fits my canon zr850 accessories . it looks nice it seems great quality .	1
this product so cool . whatever your situation , if you lot digital pictures , then i recommend going out getting sd card ... preferably up 1gb ( or even 512mb ) , use this this product . even if your camera doesn't use sd , you plop sd card right into picture frame upload photos your computer card ! it like little computer , this frame . big suggestion i find program online resizes your photos dimensions frame ( photo size explained other reviews ) . ( i downloaded visualizer photo resize ) . this take photos down its original size ( e.g. 1.8 mb ) smaller size ( e.g. 500kb ) . this let your store dramatically more photos . so far i fit over 1700 photos 430mb worth 1gb sd card i ! picture quality very good frame swivel basically any angle could used horizontally or vertically . plus , it philips , which great brand . i philips hd tv well it my baby ... i love it . this great present anyone ! how you go wrong picture frame replaces its picture any time you want	1

i olympus stylus 4mp loved it but wanted newer model . i purchased this 710 love it . olympus makes it so easy take pictures pre-set options image stabilization . i love smaller size this camera it easy use . there no way give it 4 1/2 stars so i gave it 5 but there one thing i don't like area usb plug . you pop off this cap ( it hangs off camera ) maneuver small end cable camera ( tight fit cap hanging there ) then pop cap back .. it just seems flimsy i wonder if cap eventually break off . 410 it much easier access this it near memory card . only design feature i don't care 710 . it great camera i am very happy purchase .	1
i purchased this camera case kodak z650 . this case perfect kodak z650 . it looks feels like high quality camera case allow storage sd card or two . i'm very happy this purchase	1
binoculars suprisingly lightweight their size power . 70mm lens great light gathering , 4.75 mm exit pupilprovide more light than most adults use . ( avg . 3-4 mm)with good strap easy wear long periods excellent long distance terrestrial viewing or general astromical use . you really need tripod use full power effectively , but short periods those steady hands enjoy binocs fly	1
i bought this together sony alpha ( very good deal amazon ) . lens great complement kit lens or identical but older km 18-70 . images very sharp lens built very well . great wildlife imaging . other reviewers right ; af isn't too good long end this lens but overall great camera . end lens rotate while zooming . it may not good some filters	1
i've owned t9 now just 3 weeks . i purchased it after some extensive research . course you never really know product until you've it awhile . here my thumb nail opinion . i like : ultra thin metal bodyoptical image stabilizergreat photo qualityhigh iso performancelarge , high rez screenauto focus assist lamp works wellvery fast start-upfast recovery even after flashlots built memory , but you need buy 1 or 2 gig cardok slide show feature musici don't like : redeye doesn't work welltoo few manual controlsneeds white balanceneeds long shutter speed modeschews up battery time pretty fast . already ordered second battery . no optical viewfinder ( most ultra smalls don't)flimsy plastic cover over battery first thing breakall all great little camera . takes awesome , clear pics . not professional photographer , but that not why you considering it ( i hope ) .	1
this only tripod i ever owned , however , i agree it seems very nice piece equipment , especially very low price . it suits my needs well small digital camera . only downside it not come carry bag . this oversight my part when i ordered , i'm sure i would pay just much i tripod get bag it , so i live it	1

i bought this dock seller called miga . they excellent job answering my questions product sending everything mint condition . i use dock my hp r817 . read reviews regarding insert i just went through hp part site ordered correct insert my camera . it only $5 ( before shipping ) it arrived same day dock package . dock transfers data so much faster then cradle comes camera plus it extra battery which would cost $50 up itself hp . i bought dock its dual charging ability when i go trips since this dock less expensive then fast charge travel kit . i probably won't use remote control feature or print images right dock . but what i use it its excellent product price i highly recommend it you 817 818 users out there .	1
i originally bought edit 120 ( no detachable case ) but looking separate bag which keep cables not used often ( leave home ) . then i came across edit 120+ detachable case which fit bill exactly . not haven actually seen detachable bag yet , i somewhat concerned method/design atachment . it needed easy remove , but it also needed secure ; pictures i found internet didn't show how it attached . i relieved when i actually saw how it attached . there slotted bottom main bag entire length bag ( open slot each end ) . add-on bag wide semi-rigid flap slides through slotted bottom fold down tab free end secured velcro . attachment method secure almost invisable , design compliments aesthetics original bag . i think original bag very good , add-on detachable bag makes this superb choice . unfortunately , you buy this combination . if you originally bought 120 single bag version , it doesn't slotted bottom it can't retrofitted ( i don't think they sell detachable bag separately )	1
case protective stylish without hindering camera ability store transport easily . it definately worth dough keep your nikon s1 or s2 scratching or even breaking minor fall	1
i using fuji e550 almnost two years , none problems reported some reviewers . here negatives : 1 ) flash mediocre range little finicky . if you don't depress shooting button all way , it may not flash . 2 ) bright light , screen back unusable - it washes out image . but camera fine viewfinder so this not really major issue . positives : 1 ) it takes great pictures . really excellent . 2 ) it small , easy carry . 3 ) controls well thought out positioned camera body . very easy use . 4 ) it several automatic modes - sports , landscapes , portrait , etc , or you use it manual . i always use one programmed modes . 5 ) video option not bad all - my twelve year old ( now 13 ) uses it . i so pleased this camera i bought one my administrative assistant ten months ago , she very happy it . it current price i think this camera bargain . only reason i didn't give it five stars because weak flash .	1
i amazed how well this battery performed . i make sure when i got it i complete charge complete discharge it not let me down since . i shoot well over two hours without needing change very meek battery came my camcorder ( sony hdr-hc1 ) . it thicker sticks off back little bit more so you not get your eye up eyepiece but i use lcd when shooting anyway , almost always tripod	1
i purchased this kit , primarily extra battery , which retails what i paid this item . backup battery great , but i pleasantly suprised soft case . it protects my dsc-p200 , without bulky or heavy . camera so small , it hard find good protection without spending quite bit money . case memory sticks nice well . it easy lose stick if it just floating around case keeps them securely . all all , this excellent value	1
this good padded case your camera . but back pocket shown picture phone stick out , not deep enough my phone antenna attached . it measure 4 " 3.5 " . but other than i enjoy using this bag	1
when it comes buying camcorders , i personally like one build memory . but after using this camcorder i forced change my mind . unlike other sony camcorders , first all , it offers upto 40x zoom which lot . its good use your money . you it under $400 still works better than lot choices out there . easy use , touch screen , takes still photos , good speaker so it easier record video voice , fits into your palm so speak , if you use rewritable mini dvds , you wouldn't worry go out memory . so when it comes sony camcorders , i would say better quality this one would get job properly .	1
very happy our camera ! perfect condition quick arrival	1
this battery recharger its job well . no bells or whistles , just plug it , put battery , wait red light turn green	1
i wall hung plasma tv speakers my surround system mounted either side . i able locate all receivers room super clean installation . hot pro ir target very sensitive !! initially i hot pro " box " too close tv blue indicator light always . if it glowing , you need move something . once indicator isn't lit but flashes when you use your remote , it works flawlessly	1
i decide this camera panasonic . we trust sony brand little more , so we went sony . we looking easy-to-use camera we could just pick up record our daughter ... nothing professional but good enough quality enjoy years later . i also wanted camera could take still photos so we wouldn't need both digital camera camcorder when we take vacations . here what i think so far : great camcorder exactly what we want -- picture looks great inside out , very easy use , small enough carry almost anywhere . still photos not fantastic ( only 3mp ) , but good enough me . color resolution acceptable . not easy understand lcd touch menus , but you configure buttons once you figure out which buttons you use most . i got bare minimums accessories ... bought 1gb memory card ( memory stick duo pro ) ... glad i this since i taking stills short video clips email grandparents . also got carrying case , dv tapes , extra np-fp71 battery . i'll purchasing firewire cable soon ( i'm sure you've heard , usb cable inadequate downloading video ) . handycam station doesn't really bother me much , but i see what fuss . all things considered , i'm extremely happy my purchase . i think this perfect camera firs t-t ime camcorder buyer who needs easy button ( there one side camera ) . little more expensive than some others , but price dropping . best luck !	1
solidly built , this tripod balances well even when used heavier sony cybershots like dsc-r1 . remote shuttle release button helps further reduce camera shake , which priceless when taking photos conditions where camera shake amplified ( high optical zoom , supressed flash , etc ) . what surprises me fact shuttle release button remote works exactly same any sony cybershot : press halfway focus , all way down capture sho t.t he zooming buttons not work sony dsc-r1 camera manual zooming ring , but they should work fine any other cybershot comes electronic zoom course , acc terminal . highly recommended .	1
there some very detailed reviews , most which i read before i ordered camera amazon . there ample evidence professionals find camera useful . i want take minute speak rest us . camera came month ago i've extremely happy it . let me offer some perspective my comments . last camera i bought small sony shirt-pocket-sized camera i using alot it got me back into taking pictures . i decided since i taking so many pictures i wanted camera would take much better quality shots , without my get phd picture-taking . i opted this camera 18-200mm lens . i now take same pictures i took small camera , but zoom lens i frame them better 10.2 mega pixels i blow them up frame them . there dozens ( hundreds ? ) features i grow into , but now i am delighted use this camera right out box , just minimal reading instructions . everything i remember my 35mm days ( my first camera minolta srt-101 i bought 1973 ) put use , but what i forget , camera remembers . my poin t--t his camera ready meet you wherever you grow you should you decide you want go farther out deeper	1

received camera exactly described . easy smooth transaction would this vendor again . thank	1
this very good camcorder main problem i noted dvd format giving only 30 minutes or so recording hd mode per disk . it also problem only blue-ray dvd players play back dvd hd mode . even worse it might destroy disk if you use it player . nevertheless , price good i think blue-ray more affordable near future . meanwhile , i playback my video directly or send it computer . i am glad i bought it . if minidv tape version available same price now i think it might better stick tape version now though . i sent bad power supply camcorder but sony sent new one right away . careful buy correct battery external charger accessories camera it bit confusing which work it . overall - i am very happy camcorder	1
d300 easy use it takes great video outside , very good low light . it also takes very good pictures , battery last long time . i would buy it again	1
you can't beat hd picture quality hv20 based actual user reviews comparisons all latest models . while this single cmos sensor , it true 1920 1080 hd sensor same quality found award winning canon digital slr cameras . don't fooled 3ccd camcorder uses smaller sensor sizes must use " pixel shifting " . i already hooked up hv20 my 720p projector , it look great even my typical 120 " . but i know my projector probably isn't calibrated very well honest . so , my first wow moment came when i decided capture some my best outdoor footage my canon elura stock compare it some hv20 footage shot my kids over weekend easter egg hunt . wow , difference quality even more pronounced than i realized . i guess resolution difference what it , but this definitely serious hd quality . real defining wow moment me " selling " all my family friends this camcorder came last night when i hooked it up my brother-in-law house his sony wega crt hdtv display 1080i calibrated perfection . you won't find higher quality hd display than his set imo , my jaw dropped when my video first came up his display first time when i truly able see what my source footage capable terms its full resolution amazing colors . we switched discovery hd his set , other than obvious production value aspects you honestly couldn't really say it looked any more hd than footage my kids playing . this way more exciting me than when i first saw broadcast hd watched monday night football because it hard describe how cool it see your kids video beautiful hd $ 1,000 price point . i hardly wait get out there shoot some more footage .	1
i canon eos rebel which takes fantastic pictures . i use it around home when i am setting up static shots such family portraits . only problem ... who wants lug it around take snapshots . despite some above opinions lack sharpness , i no such problems . 5900 great " grab " shots it not too shabby setting up planned shot using it advanced controls . sure you buy fast memory card . this reduce time shots . most cameras , memory card not supplied camera . mr. goyal review not able take pictures without memory card not true . you take limited number shots internal memeory . only real problem i red-eye reduction feature . i usually turn it off delay " red-eye " flash main flash too long . subjects often think shot over start move . anyway it easy enough remove it later , either photo-software or photo kisok drug store	1

least now it :-) . during course past 10-12 months i owned 7 , that seven , digital cameras : canon s230 ; kodak v530 ; 5 different models casio's: z60 , z600 , z850 , p700 ; most recently presented my wife red s770 valentine day . i also pretty good chance evaluate canon sd450 ( my brother-in-law owns one - it actually gift my wife i him his 21st birthday ) , casio ex-s600 ( good friend mine owns one ) , panasonic dmc-tz1 ( once again , gift my wife i my father-in-law his last birthday ) . if you read any my digital camera reviews ( i've written few now ) , then you know i'm not particularly fond canon lately - i think they overrated overpriced what they offer . i also mentioned before , i've tried several different kodak models ( i used work company too ! ) , but all them turned out waste my time , say least . i became big fan casio , although not all my experiences them great . but huge gadget " freak " i am , constantly wanting new " toys " , i always craved more . over time , my tastes digital cameras changed simple point shoot type camera wishing more power manual control . so one one , i returned/sold all my cameras , after extensive ( i really mean extensive ) research , i got myself lx2 . i must say though i probably wouldn't without getting know my father-in-law tz1 first . i actually quite impressed it . powerful zoom , sharp lens , decent picture quality . i also played some other panasonic models various stores just get better feel them , well spent few hours phone , exchanged numerous e-mails friend mine who owns fz30 , who swears it . unfortunately , lx2 not available anywhere locally , but i felt i got pretty good understanding what panasonic cameras all , after some more thought consideration , i went ahead bought it amazon ( nice thing buying amazon you always return whatever it you bought , including digital cameras , within 30 days full refund , no questions asked ) . i know " noise " issue high iso , but it wasn't decisive factor me , i'm glad i didn't pay much attention it got camera anyway . it turned out one best purchases i've made long while . here why : pros : - superb design . this camera wonderfully crafted . i absolutely love black ! it gives camera nice , clean , professional look . i don't think i'll buying silver camera soon after this one ; - intuitive controls , menus . i charged battery , put it into camera , started using it taking pictures right away , without even going through manual once ; - load features , including large , bright , widescreen lcd ; wide angle , super sharp leica lens 4x zoom ; mega ois - optical image stabilization control ( optical means it mechanically , which true way doing stabilizing , comparing other cameras where it " tricking " camera into using higher iso ); many more . addition , it joystick easy access different menus , number manual controls , well provides ability shoot raw format ( more later ); - it comes silkypix developer studio software working camera raw files . someone who not familiar raw - it " pure " , camera specific picture format . it varies upon manufacturer , meaning canon raw different nikon or panasonic raw , example . it " pure " sense it much better quality than standard jpeg ( jpg ) , doesn't suffer loss information , such white balance , or brightness . there lot more raw than , i'm not going go into details right now . what i want say , however , previously owned camera which supported raw format ( casio ex-p700 ) , i must tried dozen different raw editing software packages , including products adobe , ulead , arcsoft , photofiltre , picture window pro , acdsee , lightzone , image broadway , more . silkypix delivered far best results all . only one i would probably put next it bibble ; - noise - what noise ?! i really hate it when i hear people complaining noise this camera ( after it tried myself ) , or any other compact digital camera matter . you really na�ve you think you get absolutely no noise your images using compact digital camera ? think again . you might noticed i've used word " compact " several times here . i've it purpose - it inevitable compact digital camera produce some noise . some cameras better than others , but no matter how hard you try , you see some . this camera no better or worse than any other one i've had/tried . higher iso ( above 400 ) , it slightly more visible , but who right state mind using anything over iso 200 compact digital camera , such this one , anyway ? i always mine set 100 . if i feel it doesn't get job , i shoot raw ; - picture quality very good . yes , it take some time getting used , but once you familiarize yourself everything this camera capable , you achieve spectacular results , especially if you don't mind doing some post processing . much i like everything this camera offer , there , however , some things kind irritate me . here short list bad things this camera , otherwise known ascons : - first all , this camera actually somewhat misrepresented . it advertised 10.2 megapixel camera , which not entirely true . 10.2 mp resolution available only 16:9 ( wide ) aspect ratio . two more ratios available - 3:2 , more conventional 4:3 , but those offer 8.5 , 7.5 mp resolutions respectively . so if you compare this camera others don't widescreen format , or if you prefer shoot only regular 4:3 mode , then this camera should only referred 7 mp digital camera ( because not all pixels actually effective ) . obviously , panasonic aware it , marketed it higher pixel count purpose , boost consumer interest ; - i expected see compact digital camera . what i got instead actually smaller compact camera than i expected . i really surprised see how small , yet convenient hold operate , camera body . what i didn't like , however , lens . not lens itself , it actually quite superb , but fact it sticks out . i like cameras lenses retract all way back camera body . i realize it would probably loose some features , like wide angle , perhaps zoom , but i still wish it . it would so much more ... umm ... compact ?! way it actually makes it quite difficult find right case it . almost impossible , i should say . i've tried few , but they either too small or too big . i just can't find one would fit right . i put order slx1b case it , which specifically designed fit lx1 , lx2 models , but i hear they not good . we shall see ; - i'm not big fan pop-up flash . i always keep forgetting open it when i need use it . it also seems bit flimsy . i'm treating it carefully i , but i just can't stop thinking it might break soon ; - i hate lens cap !!! there , i said it . it probably just one those small annoyances keep frustrating you until you get used it , but now i'm not really happy it . summary :d espite very few minor negatives , i think lx2 probably one best , most innovative cameras market today , i sure am glad one . it offers more than any other camera same price range , even compete some dslr when it comes picture quality . if you someone like me , who wants more control and/or learn more digital photography , or dslr user who just needs solid backup carry everywhere , then this camera not overlooked ! highly recommended	1
this great camera . quality good camera very durable . i've accidently dropped camera several times , it still works . however , i would suggest getting memory card if you want take more than 24 pictures time .	1
i bought this camera replace my 35 almost couple years back . i am avid nature photographer so most my work taken outdoors . after hundreds pictures all kinds weather here lowdown ... pros ... picture quality amazing even after zooming full 10x ( i never go into digital zoom because low quality pictures , although this camera isn't too bad after complete full optical digital zoom ) . prints i've made up 16x20 " ( haven't gone larger , but i know i ) extremely impressive crisp viewing 4x6 . it easy use functions easy get use joystick . stabilization full 10x zoom incredible also . it appears really shaky through window , but pictures continue turn out crisp . close-ups clear reveal amazingly clear details . movie feature works better indoors than regular camera portion ( read cons ) . cons ... indoor shooting limited because flash isn't strong enough . when school chorus concert , pictures turned out fuzzy unclear . award ceremonies , pictures turned out once again unusable my standards . zoom fixed when using movie feature so you need zoom set before beginning movie . this camera seems eat batteries , especially winter months . i am always go , when i go pull out camera i find camera lens cover fallen off yet again . it comes off way easily causing smudges smears lens so i must always lens cleaner wipes me . viewing window cover also come off lost woods somewhere , but also minor . most cons really all minor things don't interfere amazing quality pictures long you properly prepared those minor issues . i tried precise this camera possible . all all , i would highly recommend this camera avid photographer . if you plan using camera mostly indoor activities , just keep mind flash work good , keep your subjects close . it bumped , jostled , droped couple times camera still works like gem	1
small compact . let me see everyting i wanted	1
i would recommend this anyone looking way take video pictures without hassle lugging around ( charging ) two separate gadgets . it takes excellent pictures , just good if not better than any other digital camera i seen . i am also very pleased video - i found software very user friendly video easy transfer edit my computer . battery good life , i no problems stop recharge it . there nite mode compensates ( very well , i think ) low light video . camera easy carry around ( it smaller than my 35mm ) i am no problems functionality - all all great idea easy use great pictures great video	1
beauty this charger it 110/220v compatable , so appropriate international connector you charge your batteries european voltage . i used two these plug adapters kept four sets batteries charged overnight two olympus cameras giving day plus batteries available each . very few cheap us chargers offer this multi voltage compatability . lots cheaper than multiple voltage convertors . if you plan traveling internationally , this charger must !	1
i bought these binoculars my dad christmas , he absolutely love them . distance it handle slightly above average , but clarity really where this thing shines . its very easy use , held up reasonably well . i would recomend it casual user	1
i got this camera so i could more control . i'm learning use shutter aperture settings ... i haven't explored all fancy settings much , but there tons them . i really like continuous shooting option so i'm more likely catch good action shot . wide-angle lens also allowed me get some pretty cool shots macro settings work great close-ups . i think it one best buys you find if you want take some pretty cool photos , but don't feel quite ready slr	1
seems panasonic finally dropped hammer pseudo dslr market , 420mm 12x or 749mm - 21.4 3mp outstanding especially ois . excellent pictures out box , menu operations plentiful , nr reduced jog dials front back aperture or shutter very professional . leica lens crisp sharp , i shoot aperture priority nr minimal pictures even jpeg look like they post processed , simply amazing . after experiencing this camera i sold my nikon d80 , attachment lens soft pictures nikon giving me unacceptable , i went thru every menu option including using much hyped rgb3 which way gives cartoon colors no comparison panasonic . high speed usb my only complaint data transfers , noise reduction higher iso noise bit over powering but acceptable but controllable your liking , 3 " , screen would nice but maybe next model . btw , moon shots raynox 2020 3mp give zoom 47.08 optical or 1647 mm optical , hand held shots ois ( image stabilization ) enabled gives jaw dropping pictures , you actually telescope ois your reach , simply amazing . 100% satisfied .	1
this not high-tech digital frame . it doesn't play mp3 . it doesn't come remote . it simply reads your digital pictures card displays them slide show mode . there " " button " off " button . there no manual read order learn how operate your frame ( though it come one-page instruction sheet ) . it great your office desk when all you need reach over turn it or off . if you want display it difficul t-t o-reach location , or choreograph your pictures music , then this not frame you	1

i purchased axion 10.4 " frame my wife replace defective polaroid frame different source . axion stacked up quite nicely other " more expensive " frame . axion viewable more angles than polaroid frame cheaper price tag . quality display better axion we not any technical issues . pros : brightness controlcolor contrast displayease setup operationgood sound speakers music playbackcons : slide show transitions top bottom only . different transitions would nice feature . remote not control volume music . overall advantages this frame outweigh disadvantages . we very happy overall this purchase	1
well , i'm just amazed this model still production way things changing so quickly a/v world . i bought mine two years ago recorded many hours my children they growing up . this truly low maintenance low cost solution your video recording needs if you don't lot money spend digital set-up . just buy extra after market battery or two ( they're cheap ) some inexpensive analogue tape , start recording away ! after you climb learning curve , course . my one problem this camcorder controls anything but intuitive , they're splattered all over unit . sure read user manual carefully before you try use this thing , but once you've got it down you'll find this trusty low cost companion your family vacations holidays . oh yeah , almost forgot , microphones aren't stereo but they're really quite good entry level unit	1
very well made . once you holding it you feel price quite low product this solid well designed .	1

i am very satisfied this purchase . it exactly what i wanted . i purchased 5 more business gifts important clients	1
i really enjoy this camera ; mine carl zeiss vario-tessar lens . it works grewat- sure use memory stick pro media . great reasonable priced camera	1
i canceled this order because shipment wasn't going arrive time christmas	1
first all i would like say i very reluctant buy sony camera . after doing lot research my needs i ended up canon 800is sony new toy t100 . ofcourse canon best overall ratings ever but i wanted stylish looking camera my needs . sony t100 best looking camera i seen . it features awesome compared it small size . you take it everywhere . big bright screen back clearly visible bright sunlight . it takes good indoor pictures too . i tried play its settings while thought camera not good . but then best feature camera made it winner me . auto mode takes great pictures no need set anything . sometimes changing auto iso helped reduce graniness but very honest if you not going blow image larger sizes ( which would 99% time atleast me ) it won't make difference . just point shoot . you get perfect image viewing computers . no complaints apart optional docking station which costs $80 . 5x optical zoom boon me 3x merely zoom . also zomming while taking movies makes this small camcoder 640x480 30fps shooting . it doesn't touch screen like t50 so it responsiveness better . i would like it bit faster though . also camera takes pictures very fast rate first picture you take less than 2 secs . i would highly recommend this camera anyone who afford it .	1
it pretty hard argue against this prices we're seeing ... short , not so much more than high end bridge cameras ( panasonic dmc-fz50 , fuji s9100 ) you this camera 2 kit lenses . i imagine you'll very satisfied paying difference . 8mp 2 pretty good kit lenses under $650 4/2007 , upgrade path e-510 all lenses accessories . once you make upgrade , what left ask except faster burst mode weather sealing . that 10mp , in-body , sswf live-view . imho , even if you're " entry-level " dslr user , spend extra $400+ get faster 14-54mm 2.8 - 3.5 lens get rid 14-45mm 3.5 - 5.6 lens . 40-150mm 3.5 - 4.5 very nice lens , no real peers entry-level dslr range kit lens i could see without going 3rd party . this lens put olympus over edge me . speed lens over 35mm equivalent range ( 28-300mm ) , i'm not sure what else compete price . if you faster lens longer zoom , you could cough up $800+ 50-200mm 2.8 - 3.5 , even then , that very , very good price kind lens 35mm equivalent range . camera full manual controls , expected dslr , drive newbie like me nuts , but also keep it simple it auto mode numerous scene settings ( which i use good deal ) . if you get this camera , imho , don't bother xd cards . they very slow comparison less expensive cf cards this camera . when it comes time get flash , go extra mile get olympus fl-36 over fl-20 . i'm not sure fl-50 warranted this price point . i lucky find one cheap , so i didn't research 3rd party flashes . i confess pixel-peeper compared high-iso samples this camera canons nikons world . it definitely not bad direct comparison , but after you're resizing touching up photos , you'll never notice , imho . down side , raw files ( . orf ) don't seem compressed , they're not exactly small 14mb . all all , not much complain here	1
combine high iso , low noise fast shutter speed great blur free shots low light moving subjects . this what only fuji offer you compact camera class . f31fd doesn't ( image stabilized lenses or ccd shift sensor ) , which other cameras use reduce effect blur camera shaking . but this kind stabilization really only useful 6x or more zoom , just 3x typical zoom ultra compact ps you just need hold it firmly get same results . also can't prevent blur moving subjects . high iso like f31fd you use faster shutter speeds freeze subjects prevent blur camera shaking too . fuji super ccd sensor provides lowest noise high iso you find 2007 compact cameras , quality only comparable big dslr professional cameras . ah , face detection not just gimmick or marketing appeal ... it really great , specially if someone who doesn't know how focus face then recompose scene taking pictures you , f31fd they not miss shot	1
i've seen this item no less than $7.00 elsewhere , so i got good deal .	1

i agree many reviewers -- mid range wide angle lens superb , but it not quite sharp tele -- one reviewers said -- it many things , not all them perfectly -- lens compromise , but excellent compromise -- vr added boost--i'm still debating whether or not keep it or send it back , because weakness tele -- but there nothing else replace its versatility . -- i don't want keep changing lenses	1

i bought this gift my mother she absolutely loves it ! definitely good buy	1
i purchased this camera 2 weeks ago . i love using it . it lots function play . it easy use . i didnt trouble taking good pictures zoom mode outdoor . indoor , i use tripod if i use zoom . however , i cant really think any occasion i use zoom indoor other than my testing last week . besides , it gives great pictures i loved price . i kind considered dslr camera but i gave it up becasue lenses more expensive than camera itself . i considered one wide angle lense one zoom lense . it would cost me almost 2000 dollarsso far , i love this camera . if this helps anyone considering buying this camera , id give two thumbs up .	1
i got this camera my birthday present january i'm extremely satisfied . i'm very new entire " photography world " , however this camera makes it easy get into . camera smaller than i expected , however it takes great pictures . i use it often pictures while we trips . picture quality great , however screen quality isn't up-to-par other brands . this great value i really like it . my only complaint easyshare software bad . it slow , outdated , doesn't work well overall . i recommend getting 1 gb sd card . i 3 them	1
this 10-20mm lens equivalent 15-30mm 35mm film camera , so it ultra-wide lens 10mm . i pleasantly surprised how sharp images this lens ; it rectilinear , which means straight lines real life remain straight photograph . it well-made lens , made high-grade materials . what this lens excels when you want photograph sweeping landscapes , close-quarters interior photography , architectural photography where you don't mind exaggerated converging lines ultrawide produces . personally , that what i like , so i'm very happy this sigma 10-20mm	1
i shooting away last few weeks . olympus 720 gem . i must filled up my card 3-4 times so far . new digital camera era , i am finding it not hard i thought it would . shoot , pop card into card reader , copy computer , upload walmart photo service , i my prints mailed my house few days . i am happy everything included kit . i would never known what i needed it basically everything covered	1
i just bought this $190 local px . i am impressed so far . i going buy gs180 , but sale price i would crazy pass this up . so far low light much better than single ccd . video playback quiet compared few other camcorders record motor noise onto tape . i plan buying extended battery tripod today same sale . i use this camcorder mostly home videos my son vacations we take around europe . i look froward using this camcorder lot	1

i bought this camera my girlfriend she loves it . it all basic functions her older coolpix abut more they're bit more user friendly . pros : compact easy hold . i've few other point shoots they feel like they going jump out my hand . this one feels pretty good . cons : before buying i read reviews few stating focus not everything it should . i agree . cameras only real big down fall . though my girlfriend may not notice it so much , me it little more aparant . most part , overall i really like this little guy ..	1
works better than i could hoped . i used it month it very simple execute -- but you able hold somewhat steady which not problem me . if you someone who shakes -- may problem . i compared accuracy gps devices guys playing me . this better since it gives you actual yardage pin . also , you get yardage golfer field , yardage any object , bunker , tree etc ., which gps can't . lot courses not marked correctly , , course , yardage changes depending how far off side fairway -- or even out fairway -- you . this where it especially nice . there times when without this device you just flat out guessing . this awesome piece technology . it well worth price me .	1
handy item price . not great telescope , but very useful tool look roof shingles , broken tree limbs , bird nests , etc . must stable , but carried pocket , weighs very little very clear . very good deal .	1
picture dimensions incorrect . it soft case but ribbed horizontally mine came blue . correct dimensions 2.9 " 4.2 " 1.8 " ( wxhxd ) . it also fits fujifilm v10 camera which i bought it . amazon different case built specifically v10 but it costs more might nicer based picture . i am keeping this one , it perfect fit	1
fall through spring i always carry my r817 coat pocket when i go out . this jacket fits my camera like glove . allows access all controls lcd display through clear , heavy duty plastic film , once flap opened . open flap allows lens zoom while still protecting rest camera . only time i zip open jacket remove memory chip or change battery , otherwise , i just leave jacket camera all times .	1
upgrading tz3 4yr old canon 3.2 megapixel . waited few months purchase when i heard tz1 updated . tz3 , panasonic fixed main complaints tz1 which : no build lens cover , noisy images higher iso speeds . imo , build lens cover alone wirth price permium over tz1 . others said , this camera great build quality , easy operation , high-quality look . i ordered black model pleasantly surprised when i opened box . it look retro 35mm cartridge camera , which cool . chrome ( or polished stainless steel , cant tell ) , first rate looks great matte black case . lcd huge bright . camera " simple mode " great job other modes fully customizable . zoom fantastic , but you need really steady hand full zoom , even optical stabilization turned . i take some surprisingly sharp shots zoomed way my car i came across herd deer . shot shot speed really great , unless you using flash . red-eye reduction works better than any other digital camera i used . overall , i am extremely pleased . if you looking great zoom camera small form factor , you should seriously consider dmc-tz3	1
i this camera six months i still find new features play . one my favorite mode sequence shots . i love its sleek design its durable shell . i carry camera my back pocket , even my tightest jeans . this great camera	1

i just got this camera recently printer . setting up very simple . only problem i came across putting ribbon printer . you use your finger remove slack ribbon but it not easy . when you put ribbon printer it gets caught something could damage ribbon . it takes time tons patients get ribbon printer . pictures come out very nice print even better . i washed couple pictures test quality they came out flawless . this camera value shouldn't passed up . screen camera huge buttons take some time get use too . if you any further questions feel free comment them i'll reply possible	1
this product good its price . mini tripod inside switchgrip looks very good holds my canon pro perfectly . travel bag also very useful	1
this camera exelent camara . it plenty effects , plenty modes , plenty scenery options . image quality 3.2 megapixel , but its quite good . pictures you take without flash end up getting bit blury , where if you take it flash , it comes out exelent . sometimes it takes long time picture get taken out flash , sometimes it happens imediatly . but all these flaws only my version . but if you looking good camera great price , this your best option	1
i bought these trip costa rica used them every day . they comfortable , easy focus , great choice price . these perfect folks like me who interested casual use travel , concerts , sports , etc	1
great product . good value . maybe little slow focusing , compared my old 18-55mm canon lens . good quality pictures . great all one lens	1
i've using this directional mic almost three years never noticed camera noise . it compact provides good reach most ambient sound situations	1
this only second pair binoculars i've owned but i've used many pairs before low end relatively high end ones like nikons leicas . i say without hesitation canon 18x50s met all my expectations clarity , build quality , ease use . they still quite heavy so , you won't holding them too long one position but , stabilization feature provides stable , gitter free image . my opinion , this feature makes up optics may not same league high end stuff : canon 18x50s more usable magnification money non-tripod , hand held applications . while this not scientific comparison , this example useability magnification : i beach looking parasailer distance - naked eye ( 20/20 record ) , i could see chute pattern black speck below it ; my old minolta 10x50s ( jittering my hands)i could make out shapes heads legs ; canon 18x50s , i could clearly see two people , man child well chute cords - pretty impressive . my only two gripes also mentioned before : no lense caps eye cups stiff , fit poorly ( my face any way ) uncomfortable . i find it better fold cups back " eye glass " use even though i don't wear glasses . other than , i am very pleased this purchase would also highly recommend purchasing adorama camera - they quick , accommodating responsive .	1
i sticked sony since i got my first digital camera 4 years ago sony camera moneys worth ! this one dsc-t10 one parent who carrying much already needs pack down change . it fits my purse still space more , only thing remember buy slim fitting case camera extra battery(for those kind battery not sold everywhere ) you need one when you don't thing you need extra battery , you always run out wrong time . i recommend this one	1
when etx-90pe works , it works very well makes astronmomy easy hobby get into . let me elaborate . first , best telescope one you use most often . all too frequently people buy big telescopes heavy carry , need frequent adjustment . little etx weighs less than 20 lbs all set up ( including tripod ) , never needs adjustment . it encourages frequent use . second , one most challenging aspects astronomy , especially newcomer , finding objects look . if you not familiar night sky where things located , it get very frustrating spending up 30 minutes just find one object look ! etx built computer makes finding objects easy - just select what you want see menu , scope automatically point i t.t he optical quality etx excellent . manufacturer , meade , very good job turning out optical systems rank best . some most rewarding objects - moon , jupiter , saturn , orion nebula look wonderful through this telescope . one final positive mention ease setup . pe models easiest all telescope get up running . just turn power , press one key hand held computer controller , few moments telescope start aligning itself so it automtically find objects you . you don't need worry where north , or what current date , time , location . now some cautions . first , etx-90 small telescope , not show much larger one . trade-off getting portable instrument . there larger etx models almost portable , so these might consideration . also , understand there learning curve when using built computer . it not hard , but you need some patience while you learn procedure . finally , prepared some quality control issues . good optics , some etx some mechanical problems require return factory warranty repair . my own etx-90pe go back factory twice . but once all problems fixed , it well worth it ! this note , you purchase extended warranty manufacturer reasonable price , i would recommend doing so	1
this digital camera awesome . i no problem batteries . i made sure i put good batteries ( no cheap ones ) . i looked purchasing canon hp but features it this one outstanding price . i purchased this camera 1gb card it . i can't wait start using it when i go san diego march ..... awesome digital camera ...... you won't sorry this purchase ...	1
i bought this camera replace high mp sony pocket camera , i am thrilled it . picture quality absolutely gorgeous any lighting . red eye reduction really works , gets rid red-eye before it ever gets memory card . it compact flash card memory system , which great because big compact flash cards much more afforadable than other types cards . this camera better than my brother canon slr terms picture quality , but not nearly bulky cumbersome . battery life fantastic . one other nice feature screen top camera which lets you see how many pictures you , batter life , mode , etc without opening screen . only drawbacks this camera ( 1 ) not biggest zoom lens , but plenty enough typical photographer , ( 2 ) screen could bigger , but still acceptable , ( 3 ) when you screen open , you can't use viewfinder , which little annoying , but not big deal . i owned 4 other high-end digital cameras this far best one i ever used .	1
this seemingly simple piece molded plastic recommended me professional photographer . basically it shape open box slides firmly onto flash . it small sturdy enough stash your camera bag without worrying damage . when used light disperses more evenly less harsh subject photographed . white box general use . also available green omni-bounce florescent lighting gold omni-bounce warming effect . pros : inexpensive solution better flash photography . quality product works . cons : non	1

before i get k10d , i experienced olympus e-500 , canon xti , nikon d80 . i used olympus e-500 take lots vivid color pictures i love very much , but no water resistance no second display window , also only 3 focus point makes it not so enjoyable . same thing happen canon xti , no water resistance no second display window make it little hard use when you need change settings . nikon d80 great camera but also no water resistance shake reducer build camera , color tone d80 isn't kind i would love . finally i bought pentax k10d , feeling body , water resistance , shake reducer , auto dust remove , vivid color tone , etc ... makes me feel k10d way go . only complaint would limited edition lens hard get . get it while you	1

i am writing offset some negative opinions this unit . i bought canon because it facilities external mike . i am new camcorder user so no practical experience bias my opinion one way or . first matter tape drive noise : yes i hear it if i put unit up my ear . but no noticeable noise comes up actual movie clips when played back through my computer . second , they claim you interconnect capture clips your computer . what they don't tell you you need firewire card cable ( $70.00 total best buy ) . you cannot simply hook up through available computer usb port . fortunately , microsoft provides necessary drivers xp os minimal capture software called " moviemaker " . i am not too pleased tape system but considering price unit , i think it bargain . finally , i become aware through short experience unit ergonometric design right hand very well thought out . your thumb easily controls on/off tape transport functions . it really easy use , least right handed users . all considered , i am satisfied product . course , if it dies next week , i different opinion	1

this great buy if you just wanting some fun , no real investment . although it go beyond 17 feet , not far you may think . but , i used it while snorkeling pictures turned out great , i am sure few more than 17 feet .	1
pros : compact , lightweight , portability , easy use , big screen , good reproductioncons : microphone sensitive wind , getting used not viewfinder , bad low light performance . summary : i picked this camera upgrade my old canon zr10 . first reason i chose it small size portability . good light conditions , this little beast its best shots , but low light conditions this camera disapointed me ( specially compared mi old zr10 ) . please don't buy it if you plans use it stills shots because it low resolution . included handycam station all ports ( firewire , usb , power , video ) you need conect it . big touch screen must , because screen only way access camera controls ( besides some them edge screen ) . you camera more characteristics better image quality same price , but if your concern size portability this your best choice world mini dv format	1

part definitely up nikon awesome standards . i bought it future use , i don't currently lens yet , but when price becomes affordable i purchase it too	1
this best price i found my second rechargeable battery my nikon coolpix 5200 . it perfect , so nice second battery !!! it shipped so fast , i received it within few days	1
this pretty good camera , loaded lots features . pros include 10x optical zoom , use sd card , battery consumption . also , this camera you ability buy add-ons such zoom lenses such - makes it nice those just past beginner experience . there couple cons i've found , most important picture quality . although it capability take great photos , you make sure wait several seconds shots ensure they'll come out looking great ( my opinion , anyway ) . size okay , although it kinda bulky so small . i prefer something size also slim - it not so easy carry around because this . overall , this camera very easy use	1
nice portable background support kit . stability might issue but if portability your first concern then you overcome stability issues weights or caution . easy quick put up . i put it up myself very little effort . all rolls up nice compact bag transporting	1
i bought canon powershot a70 . they say your best camera one you use most , man i use it . i'm high schooler , so i dont much money , but a70 , i attach this adapter ( la-dc52c ) my camera , i more photographic freedom lenses , alot less money . you this adapter first . then any lense which fits ( most ) , used ... good idea canon !!!	1
well , this lens work wonderfully expand your angle better shots , but if you don't good lighting , you end up pictures worthless . i suggest never using this poor indoor lighting flash comes dx6490 not clear top wide angle lens therefore becomes useless . best outdoor shots or areas where overhead backlighting sufficient enough take pictures without use flash . plan ahead before just attatching lens taking pictures . also remember because you can't use flash option , you need stabilize camera better avoid blurry shots . otherwise , this lens excellent . it fits easily into my camera bag , simple attach ( lens converter course ) takes great shots without fisheye effect . other than inability use my flash lens , i think it great	1
just like any other minidv tape . good pric	1
i received this product timely manner . it exactly what i needed . thank you	1
after springing cybershot august so i could compact camera i would actually take places , i've very , very pleased . last camera i older sony dsc quite bulky , ran batteries , shutter problems -- but it took great quality pictures interface features perfect , so i thought i would go dsct5 , since it avoids all those problems . only tiny battery charge , no sticky shutter ... it sexy hell . screen huge very bright . i hate taking pictures flash general , i find flash makes nasty redeye more often than not this camera . ( camera gives you impression you cant change shutter speed or anything ) however ! you easily change this going into over/under exposure options under exposing your photos when you dark environments . they come out surprisingly well blur-free	1
some reviewers below said this microphone doesn't work sony hot shoe . wrong . click " technical details " this page you'll see sony camcorder models this microphone works . failure look which camcorders compatable this microphone fault customer , not any fault microphone ! so don't give it low rating based your own lack research when buying product , please	1
this camera great investment . photos turn out wonderfully . better than regular film camera i kept eye out simular cameras ... price wise we got fantastic deal this camera it well worth price . only problem i found it batteries wear out soooo fast but i think all digital cameras problem . this great camera	1
i bought this camera just before trip ca then cruise ! it very easy operate ( even techno-retard like me ) pictures turned out great ! i started use filming feature recently my video recorder my son @ college i want film my daughter drill team performances ! i really like fact it doesn't turn while my purse !!! my old camera couple times , i ended up quite few pictures contents my purse - anyone want one ? ( lol ) all all , great buy ! 8 months later lcd display gone ! literally , gone ! don't know what happened - took pictures/movies daughter drill team performance , when i got it out again take pictures before sadie hawkins , it would still take pictures ( i just downloaded them ) but since display looks like " piece plaid fabric marijuana leaf coming right side " i don't know what i'm taking picture ! need replace soon ! i'm ( now ) bummed	1
very good camera . this present my wife she needed new camera . she picked it out liked it came complete kit . directions hard follow times could printed larger . takes some getting used . zoom lense works great takes good pictures . where on-off button so close shutter , you careful you don't accidentally shut camera off . she very satisfied it .	1
after setting booby traps zombies , i like whip out my bushnell waterproof scope wait oncoming herds trample . this scope just great because it cuts down glare also waterproof . it good some foreward advancement options when dealing zombies so when you set up this scope give you good range spotting them your trail !!	1
this adapter only one available hd1 while it good job protecting 1st lense whichever 49 mm one you attach , there problem when you use flash pictures things within 10 feet . there dark semicircle bottom your pictures where flash blocked adapter . i've gotten around this using adapter attached lens lens cap attached string camera . whenever i need take picture flash something up close ( within 10 feet ) i pop off whole setup take picture if entire piece giant lens cap regular camera . hope helps	1
i enjoy all features this item . main compartment hold camera soft secure . you open it without worrying your camera falling off . back compartment roomy enough all basic gear . slot memory cards 1-4 ( depends card type ) , batteries ( roomy four aa ) , cables fit i t.t he shoulder strap basic looks flimsy . it not long enough hold comfortable diagonally but side good . belt loop very secure fit belt three inch width . it even handle worst environment ever . hot , dry climate sandstorms occasional accidental drops . it protected my dig . camera very well	1
i bought this my wife so she could pull out camera , turn it , take nice photo . flash works well , unlike some reviews i've read . battery life appears fine also . this small , light camera , measuring 3 1/2 " wide , 2 1/4 " tall , 3/4 " deep when turned off . not exactly credit card , but likely close one you're gonna get . camera opens up instantly , takes nice photo whether or without flash , battery life appears ok , controls easy use -- either figuring them out or using your fingers them . nice big screen 2 1/4 1 1/2 , so you easily see what going -- nice plus . this camera also nice " reminder " listing right display , so you see flash setting ( , off , etc . ) , iso setting those you use , very nice way access other controls shown auto focus , self-timer , antishake , iso sensitivity , white background ( am i losing you yet ? ) , so . one point remember this listing arranged most-likely-to-use least-likely , so user interface strong consideration design this camera . i've gotten some nice pictures this , without flash . nice pick . why not 5 stars ? cuz i've also bought more expensive digital camera gives me more choices , although price this camera fine it'd one i'd buy again , but it isn't equal dig cams 6x optical zooms , separate iso settings , all those other techie things , frankly , aren't important lot users but which need considered rating . buy carrying case , i , so camera doesn't get scratched or lost cuz it'z so small . i don't any " special fear " this but it also easy buy small carrying case stash this into , so why not it ? all my reviews , i no financial interest one way or other what i review . also , don't forget you likely want bigger memory card store pix , maybe second battery swap out when needed . consider these additional costs , but also consider these additional costs apply any camera you buy .	1
i've this camcorder week now i think it works great .. except touch screen feature . takes little getting used .. especially when accessing special features ( such fader effects ) while filming . digital still quality poor when recording directly memory stick .. but same images taken still prerecorded tape much clearer . all all it good product .. just takes some getting used	1
this one best camcorders market today i would definitely recommend it anyone planning buy mini-dv camcorder positive factors : - very small easy hold one hand . easily attached even mini-tripod ease . - excellent widescreen video hi-fi audio . your videos finally get " hollywood " feel when you shoot movies 16:9 ratio ( widescreen format ) . even if you don't widescreen tv currently , you very soon one more more people buying them . so its better buy this camcorder shoot 16:9 format enjoy your movies later widescreen format . - includes widescreen rotatable lcd so what you see what you get when you shoot 16:9 ratio ( widescreen format ) - good battery life . one extra battery enough . you easily manage day worth shooting two batteries before recharging them again - includes docking station making it easier connect computer or tv . if you good computer firewire port , please buy firewire cable connect camcorder your computer . you download your movie excellent clarity . avi format edit it required - make sure change audio setting 16 bit ( instead default 12 bit ) very good hi-fi audio - touchscreen menu system great . you don't search any buttons they all available touchscreen menu itself . - 10x optical zoom more than sufficient ordinary home videos . anything more produces more " shaking " would necessiate use tripod . when you shoot without tripod , 10x best zoom you achieve without worrying shaky videos - widescreen still photo . photo clarity ok not too good . so please don't expect great shots . since photo 16:9 format , you take panoramic photos cover more people group shots - nightshot : cool feature records using infrared light . useful shooting night you record video even 100% darkness - color widescreen viewfinder - very useful when you running down batteries need use viewfinder . color widescreen viewfinder gives excellent picture good lcd clarity negative factors : - outdoor videos especially bright sunlight overexposed . so please adjust white balance when shooting outdoors . add white-balance menu your shortcuts so you easily access it return default once you start shooting indoors - sensitive microphone may pick up button clicks ( best turn off button click " beep " sound ) . notes : - use fresh cassette after recording 2 or 3 times same cassette . head tends get dirty if you re-record same cassette more than 3 times - you edit movies windowx xp using windows movie maker , but beware it not support 16:9 ratio video . hence your videos look ugly you shot them 16:9 but movie maker converted it 4:3 . invest pinnacle software version 9 or 10 better movie editing capabilities . pinnacle only software , i am aware , preserves teh 16:9 ratio . even roxio could not allow 16:9 format . - you also invest wide-angle lens it gives excellent coverage	1
great add-on xacti hd1 , but two minor problems i've found so far . 1 . i can't use circular polarizing filter wide angle lens it cuts off corners picture ; 2 . flash photography won't work pop-up flash becomes obscured barrel add-on lens	1
very small easy carry . neat zoom , bit hazy image stabilization but overall good buy buck	1
[ below my recent review jvc everio gz-mg40 , which 20gb hard drive rather than 30gb . becase gz-mg50 seems identical gz-mg40 save hard drive capacity , i thought this review would useful those considering buy gz-mg50 . ] ---------------------------------------- i using this camcorder almost two weeks now . here my impressions : pros : ) this tiny camcorder i easily carry it my pocket everyday . ) it records directly [ 30gb ] harddrive . this probably most amazing feature this camera . it following amazing benefits : ( 1 ) huge recording space ( 2 ) random access recorded videos when browsing ( through thumblist videos ) ( 3 ) super fast transfer onto your computer through usb 2.0 . ( 4 ) no tapes , no cds , no dvds worry while recording video . ( 5 ) facilitates easy archiving/organizing . example , all recorded files camera harddrive " creation date " part their file information . when camera connected your computer , you sort all files date easily separate all recordings date different folders simply selecting dragging . ( this extra , but if you want index able search your video files , say google desktop , simply enter list keywords file name contents file . ) ( 6 ) harddrive your camera double additional portable storage media- this unlikely but if you wanted you could even install linux it carry you operating system your camera . ) video quality good consumer level video camera . sound quality recorded through internal microphone good : i hear lectures i record very clearly there no annoying noise generated camera . ) charger comes this camera very small . so you carry around well worry less running out battery . cons : ) no mic jacks . ) manual focus light adjustments through menus . ) editing software comes it limited . ) battery life mere hour(but you buy 3 hour battery 70-80 dollars ) . all camcorders , still images shot this camera not level quality you get good still camera . it produces reasonable snapshots well lit situations . video files recorded this camera " . mod " extension their name . i replace " . mod " " . mpg " most my standard video viewing software automatically recognize files	1
i looked everywhere this charger . everywhere town wants me buy something else might work . it great finally find actual charger comes camera . it just right size plugs right into wall . prongs fold down fit nicely carry-on bag . thanks so much this item available	1
i waited long time canon come out image-stabilized binoculars 100% waterproof design . these worth wait . i bought mine specifically cruise up alaska inside passage . one our sight-seeing excursions 45-foot boat heavy seas . fellow this trip massive set fujinon 16x40 gyro-stabilized binoculars sell nearly $ 6,000 . we spent time comparing my canon binoculars his fujinons . optically there no comparison . canons , while not superb optically best leica binoculars , awfully good . they far brighter , much sharper , more accurate their color rendition than fujinons . only reason spend extra $ 4,500 + fujinons if you require absolute best image stabilization money buy . if you using binoculars very severe conditions ( high seas , etc . ) you get better performance gyro-stabilization fujinons . 99% applications you get far better results canons . though fujinons higher their rated magnification only time you'll see difference under conditions where motion severe . calmer seas ( not calm , just not severe ) you better off canons ; fuji so much dimmer lacking clarity canons make up magnification difference fairly quickly . finally , waterproof aspect these binoculars really worth . above-mentioned trip we buffeted rain spray waves . canons functioned flawlessly without hitch , cleaned up nicely afterwards . these one best products i've ever used , lived up their performance claims every regard . one point note : if you want maximum battery life it well worth buying lithium aa batteries use these binoculars ; this greatly extend your battery life , particularly cold weather	1
i bought these binoculars my dad christmas , he absolutely love them . distance it handle slightly above average , but clarity really where this thing shines . its very easy use , held up reasonably well . i would recomend it casual user	1
i like bag . pleanty pockets pouches all my little small accessories . just wish it little better suited 2 cameras like i . but , everything fits ... comfortable haul around all day . nice pads straps secure it my back . well padded equipment . i'd highly recommend it anybody	1
this item great .... i love it ... i my 35 mm digital camera it everything else i need ..	1
this very good product , price cheap , come bag which plus , if you looking cheap but sturdy monpod , this right one , highly recommanded	1
optika mp100 pro photo monopod surprisingly sturdy , functional well-made . it supplied reasonably decent quality zippered nylon case carrying strap . no , it not " professional grade " , but it something every amateur photographer use weekend shooting . i've used it both digital still camcorder , where it offers respectable improvement long-distance shots ( versus trying hold camera still , or propping it up roof car , not-nearby-enough fence post , so . ) certainly lot handier than old tripod ! i bought two , keeping them ready-for-action trunk my cars . highly recommended	1
not knowing fully what i getting into , whim i purchased this monopod hoping half-way decent product , i mean-it so cheap . i pleasantly surprised find how sturdy unit what i very high quality monopod . this my second monopod so i compare it ( other bought auction website ) . comparison opteka far better monopod height robust thickness i use it exclusively my minidv shoots	1
i got this lens shooting architecture distance -- unsual application . i've also found myself using it shoot kids soccer games . it super sharp very fast focusing . i haven't formal tests all apertures , but images appear vivid contrasty range settings . online reviews rank this lens very highly my own experience supports those findings . image stabilization seems work very well , although sure turn it off if you're using tripod--i've found it reduce image quality if you forget turn it off application . shots where you'll standing around lot lens your eye , ready shot , it gets kind heavy carry . if you're shooting sports , you might want consider monopod . other applications , its weight low enough not too big problem . it comes canvas-like case includes loop you use attach it your belt . i've found this works pretty well out field , particularly when combined photo-vest . case also carried neck strap , but this gets way your camera strap also thin , so it kind cuts into your shoulder . i write this , amazon site link 58mm filters this lens . it takes 77mm filters	1
i got this lens complement my 10-22mm 100-400mm lenses . it great general purpose lens ( not too wide , not too narrow ) everyday walk around shooting . image stabilization constant aperture nice features . it also weather sealed so you don't worry elements much most other lenses , course you would need weather sealed camera body completely safe , but it still makes me feel little better sandy or snowy conditions . i use this rebel xt rebel xti which 1.6 crop bodies make this closer 38-168mm which useful portrait work , landscapes , large animals , or somewhat close macro . course there lenses all these things better , but get this all one package really valuable . after all you less likely miss shot if you 1 versatile lens vs . 5 really great specialized lenses ( not you shouldn't get those too , but this good all around contender . ) i posted few photo examples above show range colors versatility this lens . it not sharpest lens i , nor fastest , but it one my camera most often unless i am going out shoot something specific . if you don't want spend quite much , 28-135mm also very good lens	1
my first lens i'm sold . while i spend lot time - lot , this isn't small purchase - deciding this 24-70/ 2.8 , i feel i made right decision . first , i took into account what i actually shot . not what i thought shooting or wanted shoot , but what i really spent my time shooting . then i backed up looking past six months ' worth photos . me , this right choice . big decision wasn't over image quality - rather it max aperture . 2.8 vs 4.0 . 4.0 won . i absolutely love ! even higher speeds , rocks . ( it also eats batteries like hummer guzzles gas)ok , so shooting it dream . incredibly fast focus . wonderful fit finish . i could gush all night . if you're spending lot time trying justify it , don't . if it won't break your bank , it well worth it . if you're trying decide which lens , try what i . it made all difference me . what downside ? i'm ordering 17-40 today . lens bug bitten . next 70-200/ 2.8 . there goes kids college fund . : -	1
while it isn't fashionable use anything but zoom lens anymore , this series 135mm fixed focus lens " real deal " . it superbly sharp , fast , easy use . i took it africa me astounded its brilliant clarity . great portraits ... anything requiring mid-length telephoto . highly recommended	1
recent nye event , i shot lot photos concert setting without flash am very impressed sharpness clarity this lens performance . its so fast colors vibrant . i am not seasoned pro but 20d this lens , it makes me look pretty close . i shoot manual once i got my aperture shutter speed dialed , it pumped out lot great pics . i also shot some pics waterfalls ( slowing down my shutter speed get soft flowing image ) portraits people again , it oozed excellence . 135mm focal range not convenient zoom , but quality this prime lens makes up any incovenience	1
i recently purchased this lens 24-105mm part fall cash cannon rebate program . so , originally , my main reason get this lens because it would save me $50 off other lens via doubling rebates make it pretty cheap . but now i used it awhile , i am really happy i got it . 1.8 maximum aperture two things really well , lets you take low-light handheld shots isolates subject . see my example photos examples both these features . i use this canon rebel xt rebel xti which 1.6 crop factor make this lens more like 135mm which good bad depending your usage . this lens produces very sharp results doesn't weigh much , so it easy carry around . if you already good range zoom lenses looking something just take really nice , sharp , handheld shots , consider this lens	1
bought this my daughters karate tournements i am very pleased quality pictures i gotten . this baby never comes off my xt	1
this uv filter it job protect lens well . build solid ( metal construction ) . glass also descent quality . performance , it absorbs some uv light . uv light absorbtion hardly noticeable , probably sky 1-a haze filter version absorb more uv light than this lens which fine me . now , one problem which internal reflection . i've heard many people say it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out it not caused directly low light/night situation . internal reflection appear when there strong/bright source light comparison overall exposure ( surrounding environment ) . put it example ( which hopefully easier understand ) , when you take picture lamp during nightime light much brighter than surrounding area then you see internal reflection . you move position light closer sides/corner picture ( not center picture ) , internal reflection reduces finally dissapear ( if you move light far enough center ) . if light isn't too bright/contrast compare surrounding environment then there no internal reflection . but course most time , lamp nightime often very bright . but point i'm trying make internal reflection doesn't happen all time during low light or night time . additionally , internal reflection isn't only happening night . it also happen afternoon if you taking picture sun example . basically same rule above , how bright light source compared surrounding area , you move sun center photo near side internal reflection move side/dissapear ( also depending angle ) . but best way just remove filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you reduce occurence internal reflection identifying correctly when internal reflection occur then remove filter during those situation ( which not hard ) . i'm actually not fan lens filter ( any filter ) i think it only degrade picture quality we added layer sensor object , but i decided use them anyway all my lens . i would recommend everyone get one this filter if you don't any filter your lens . i got this filter friend mine his nikon 18-70mm ed dx lens .	1
i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
10d outstanding digital camera . i using both mine over year now they everything i needed , when i needed it , wthout single flaw . i really use 10d . i taken over 30,000 pictures it . i use optional 2 battery bg-ed 10d which gives me easy 400 pictures . 17-40 canon zoom lens worked spotlessly well . pictures crisp . easy manual focus auto focus works well even low light . i like solid feel 10d , especially 2 battery pack , 550ex flash . i shoot exclusively manual mode so i can't comment other settings . adjusting flash output , iso etc all easy quick . i found this very intuitive camera . viewing screen back camera clear gives me good feedback adjusting my flashes or hot lights . i use lexar 1gb compactflash cards . i carry epson p-2000 multimedia storage viewer my back up . only drawback i found couple my women friends who found it bit heavy . i not only gotten use its weight but come really appreciate " feel " camera . i tell you i never use film again . epson photo 2200 printer , iphoto my own digital darkroom thanks photoshop cs i everything i need right here home . downloading pictures my macintosh g4 or powerbook i use firewire sandisk reader . it too works perfectly . so if you don't need increased megapixal 20d i would suggest you consider 10d . one great camera .	1
this timer/cable release lot features . works well . cord somewhat short though , it cheap plastic construction . hard imaging it costs this much . i think it over priced . but it job .	1
i this product over two years used it extensively my travels . yes it shortfalls " may " considered expensive , but price it better than some other " aftermarket " designs other camera makes . amature timelapse timed exposures it works quite well . far remote instant low light or exposure shots it expensive , get canon rs-80n3 shutter releasethe biggest complaints seems limited number shots [ 99 ] certain modes shortness connecting cable length . using " continous " mode i not failed capture timelapse photos filled my needs . short connecting cable corrected purchasing canon et-1000n3 extension cable [ 33 ft ] . now $2.50 + foot , expensive ! but my persuit remote control capability must . battery life fantastic , thousands shots still going strong . course like camera battery spare blessing [ this case cheap ] . i think it good accessory , if you enjoy time lapse spent money one new eos cam then price comparable your continuing outlay your hobby .

i bought this flash my canon 30d because numerous promises canon makes how it performs all 30d automatic manual functions ... they right ! spite it relatively small size , it most powerful flash i've used any brand . replaced non-canon brand flash supposed work 30d but didn't , i could not more delighted 580x . whether you're shooting av , tv , , or modes , you not disappointed its performance . it expensive ; but it worth price if you rely your flash perform your camera capabilities	1
580ex wonderful flash i would not hesitate buy it again . fact i might even buy second one . there however couple issues you should aware . 1 . battery compartment door takes little getting used . you may feel like you going snap it off first . not really big deal though . 2 . ( my opinion this big deal ) . `auto focus assist ' completely useless . its just led pointed through rather bad `lens ' . it won't anything past couple feet . laser diode diffraction grating would made it work far past useable flash distance this price canon should know better . all told however it wonderful flash . circular command dial make adjusting flash exposure easy ( dial more or less flash relative ambient light ) . if you not external flash get one . it makes huge difference . this great offering .	1
excellent performance , reasonable price . highly recomend this product	1
this seemingly simple piece molded plastic recommended me professional photographer . basically it shape open box slides firmly onto flash . it small sturdy enough stash your camera bag without worrying damage . when used light disperses more evenly less harsh subject photographed . white box general use . also available green omni-bounce florescent lighting gold omni-bounce warming effect . pros : inexpensive solution better flash photography . quality product works . cons : non	1
i am technology guru this camera simple use great results . touch screen awesome !!! battery life so much better than other cameras i owned . i think this one outlast perform any them . buy it now if you want quality camera make you happy !!	1
camera works great us so far ... we 3 year old digital camera so this upgrade better technology ... takes much better pictures than our old one ... video great ( except very low light ) ... we've taken lot short video clips our kids grandma ( etc ) ... nobody our family wants watch more than 5 minutes any one home video anyway ... so this camera saves us buy camcorder ... ( although our 1gb card we could take 45 minutes or so continuous video medium setting ) ... touch screen great simple ... camera quick response time indoor action pictures again great pictures our kids running around or birthday parties ... i took 92 minutes video 55 pictures ( plus sharing images videos others ) before battery ran out first time ( couple weeks shooting our family ) . i guess everyone their own needs when picking digital camera , but this one works great ours	1
if you would like list sites reviews email gumby ( ) dontquotemeonthat ( dot ) com pros : great sharpness even wide open ( wayyyyy better than 2.8 zooms 2.8 ) . nice weight size . shallow dof wide angle lens . cons : lateral ca glows purple green close distant bokeh . watch high contrast situations . my first copy doa . no weather seal . hood too tight . pros : fantastic ! this one excellent piece glass . incredible low light , vibrant clarity color . well balanced 20d/batter pack or 1d . cons : none what so ever . if your newbie here some info lens " fast " when it low f-stop ... ok so when you smaller number apature bigger which allows more light through , so this means you up shutter speed . still enough light reach sensor . ok so lets say you out door shot if you say f/4 lens shutter speed could 1/250 second you would get good exposer . now this lens only go f/4 but if you same outdoor setting , f/ 2.8 lens you could jump 1/500 second get same exposer . freeze action mmore effectivly , this i believe why it " fast " lens . ok fun get it	1
what great little piece kit . it great my ef 70-200mm f/4l . only drawback you've no af . you forced use manual focus . now this isn't big problem , unless you're photographing wildlife or moving objects . well worth price though very useful	1
manufactured soft gray felt like material , tough leather bottom , draw string closure top , this lens pouch helps protect your lens dust elements . i store my lenses camera bag , these cases fit nicely around lens taking up little precious space . this case meant use canon ef 135mm f/2l usm , ef 24-70mm f/ 2.8 usm , ef 24-105mm f/ 4.0 usm , ef 28-70 f/ 2.8 , ef 50 f/ 1.0 usm , ef 85mm f/ 1.2 usm lenses . these lenses normally come case when sold new . there no need buy one amazon often suggests . however if your case worn , replacing it protect your lens recommended . pros : protects your glass investmentcons : i cannot think	1
i weddings , portrait , outdoor photography i don't see any reason why i'd ever switch d70 ( other than d80 :) . this camera professional grade consumer price point . don't scared 6.1 mp . i print 20x30 all time w/ out any problems . i'd recommend reading thom hogans manual	1
it learning curve , that sure , but wow ! this camera worht every penny , far more stable then comparable canon rebel , product comes better lenses . quality glass matter	1
this camera excellent one !! really when you compare its price its results level quality you get you know why this best its category , i'm getting very professional results using it lot styles .. highly recommended	1
i 2 rebel cameras so it just made sense me pick up this digital camera attach my old lenses . while i owned other digitals i keep going back my old rebel , until now . we got back up battery pack . my husband i love it	1
i decided get this after buying rebel xti already owning rebel xt ( this works both . ) i already corded shutter release which nice when doing long exposures or macro work where even little camera shake make huge difference . but this goes new level , you set camera up get everything focus then step back take many shots you want without any risk touching camera . make sure cover eyepiece when using this so stray light doesn't ruin your exposure . this also handy when you want take pictures you them . i even used it two cameras once get multiple angles same shot . i am thinking setting up blind setting up camera tripod try get some close up pictures wildlife would not possible otherwise . basically if you ever need take pictures without holding camera this your solution	1
i bought this remote canon digital rebel xt . pretty much programs itself . great asset it clips camera strap . works good distance . highly recommen	1
impressive feature list wih affordable price , serious ameteur . i've using 20d 18-55 , 50mm 1.8 , 35-80 , 80-200 500/1000mm lenses . i am not disappointed . i am planning upgrade series lenses but slowly . i not mean over entusiastic canon , but i am yet see nikon camera same specs same or ever near equal price . i've got fm10 film photography . i love both my cameras . impressive features include : mirror lockupiso 3200 noise reduction18 custom functionsaccepts entire series canon lens . heavy metal body ( no cheap plastic feel	1
i purchased this lens primarily use macro lens . since i shoot mostly wildlife ( including bugs ) i thought field view 160mm ( used my canon rebel xt ) would just ideal . reality fl not enough . i approach bugs much too close they frequently left scene quickly . pictures taken lens extremely sharp bocah ( out focus area behind subject ) very nice . i wound up selling lens ebay since it didn't meet my needs	1
this fantastic piece glass . extremely sharp little artifacts . awesome lens i recommend highly . i love going local botanical gardens mounting this baby my 20d . well worth cost . if you dont tripod , buy one	1
" wow ! " all i say express my reaction after getting prints taken my 17-40 . i've using nikon manual-focus nikkors since 1988 always satisfied color sharpness . however , after using canon " " series , i've sold lot my nikkors . color , clarity , sharpness , detail " " lenses amazing . prints this 3-d effect ( without use those silly red/blue glasses ! ) 8-) within 3 weeks receiving my 17-40 , i ordered 70-200 . those two lenses replace my whole nikkor collection . build really good . " " zooms little bulkier , but very managable . nikkors smaller , but very heavy . but lense technology coatings improved so much 20 years , i see difference . i tested lens pointing it toward sun . 17-40 surprising handles flare very well . sun just outside field view , there very little flare loss contrast . i also make 12x18 prints , this lens handles them easily . body going limiting factor ( refering digital bodies ) . warning : once you use " " glass , you going spoiled . you may not settle consumer lenses anymore , although some non-l lenses quick good what i read	1
this great lens . i use it full-frame film digital slrs , love getting ultrawide shots . however , if you cash , you'll probably happier 16-35/ 2.8 lens , f4 pretty slow indoors	1
owned distortion-prone nikkor afs 17-35 2.8 six years , it time switch over canon ef 17-40 mm f4l usm . canon version over $1000 cheaper , optically superior lighter weight . me , outstanding standard lens when coupled canon 5d . vignetting f4 minimal . adobe photoshop cs2 vignetting tool correct vignetting . distortion 17mm minimal . less than canon ef 16-35 mm 2.8 usm set 16 mm . 5d pointed blue sky , ef 17-40 hunted focus point while ef 16-35 didn't . flaring minimal when compared ef 16-35 . portraits taken 40 mm produced better results than ef 16-35 afs 17-35 35 mm . images produced f4 sharp . f8 , images very sharp . this lens definite keeper .	1
i seen glowing reports this lens several magazines , most notably shutterbug . it truly splendid performer one well worth paying if photographer needs extra working distance afforded macro lens 180mm 200mm range . its performance certainly good , if not better , than nikon venerable 200mm f4 micro nikkor , which one first - if not first - telephoto macro lenses this focal length . this canon lens excels not only macro photography but also nature photography , getting close-up images animals wild without working too close disturb them . if i owned canon equipment , then this lens would essential part my kit	1
product top quality product . filters work excellent my canon powershot s2 . without doubt , worth every penny , especially considering price i paid it , which least half where i saw it listed other places . very happy purchase	1
backpack holds all my stuff extra room . only thing i thought i ordering bag not backpack based picture shown . backpack little heavy side me but i like it	1
absolutely love this camera bag ! i hate dealing purse camera bag while traveling , so i just carry this bag . everything i need ( wallet , cell phone , car keys chap stick ) plus all camera equipment fit just fine this bag . you can't go wrong this . my husband even hold it me since it not purse !	1
this bag small , but it fits my canon rebel xt kit lens battery grip . i also carry 50mm/ 1.7 lens there still room manual , battery charger other small components . i getting bigger bag when i start acquiring more lenses , but it great now summer travel . it also looks nice very sturdy	1
you know , i researched this lens again again . i put it my christmas list . year half went i finally just bought it . my gosh , everything true ! this one world great lenses . what piece glass . image stabilization i take candid shots candlelit restaurant using available ligh t.t he lens magical . it captures soul its subjects . nature photography phenomenal . this incredible tool take you new level . just it ! no regrets . honest .	1
i am portrait professional photographer over 40 years . i needed wide angle lens weddings wanted know quality kit lens . i test using rebel xt kit lens canon 16-35mm lens which costs somewhere around $ 1,500 . i set both cameras 18mm focal length tripod . i took shots outdoors indoors . images exactly same . outdoor shots show objects infinity well 10 ' away . i made 8x10 prints showed them my fellow professional photographers . nobody could identify which lens took which . this real world scenario	1
many people think this kit lens . it not ! numbers match , but kit lens not usm worth 1/2 price . go canon web site take look lens chart . this lens much faster better glass than kit lens .	1
compare price product i highly recommend any one who own canon eos camera ...	1
awesome lens , especially price . it very fast 50mm even 1.6 mag my rebel xt easily manageable	1
my 2 year old really active my point shoot camera cannot keep up him . i also don't like washout look when i uses flash . so i researched which slr best meet my needs , mainly catching fast action , candid moments low light photos without flash . canon 30d comes up top list . it best high iso performance its class ( better than nikon sony ) . when i combine 30d fast zoom lens ef-s 17-55 mm f/ 2.8 , result amazing . i stop any action daylight , capture every candid expression my 2 yr old fast burst mode , take indoor or night photos without using flash or tripod . portraits also excellent sharp image beautifully blurred background ( bokeh ) . even dimly-lit decors disneyland haunted mansion came out superb when we went there halloween party night , without flash or tripod . this really important factor me buy this camera , taking pictures tripod not option when your subject active 2 yr old . but you need good lens make this work well . if you use cheap kit lens , then it probably not matter which camera you pick . remember these 3 all very good cameras small differences image quality you see reviews apparent only when they use best prime lens ( not kit lens)and crop pictures magnify details . sony very good choice if you budget don't need low light performance ( use flash save money ) . nikon more custom function than canon , it really good canon . they both their strength weakness . canon just happens slightly better high iso performance suits my need better than nikon . fair , i should mention nikon d200 tops most reviews camera year , beating canon 30d overall . but d200 bit too advanced amateur like me , better suits someone more serious photography . d80 like " mini " d200 , but slower . so it really boils down what you really need how much you want spend . shooting low light without flash need good high iso performance , good fast lens ( wide aperture , usually expensive ) , image stabilization . if that what you want , canon 30d ef-s 17-55 mm f/ 2.8 not disappoint you	1
this camera incredible . i ordered it my husbands birthday he just begining figure it all out . there so many great features . one best how quickly you take digital pictures . our other digital cameras lag time shots , but not this one . pictures crisp it easy even novice like me use . i highly recommend this camera if you want take digital photography next level . it one best	1
good fit , works advertised , stores lens . helps keep night dew off lens well unwanted light out during day	1
it 72mm lens hood , no vigneting , works great . must using ef28-135 outdoors	1
last battery good almost 5 years . easily rechargeable . couldn't ask more	1
there many after market batteries this camera every review indicates they not effective , this oem battery sony delivers goods , extremely long lasting power handle not only digital picture taking but all additional flash requirements	1
i'm very pleased this small unit great deal power . it compact , not heavy , adjustable power output simply spinning wheel camera left or right . addition light output , head tilted so light direct or bounced , excellent feature . getting up running this unit breeze because i am totally " brochure reading averse . " twenty years ago i photographer big equipment , but given up both . i surprised control one such small relatively inexpensive unit	1
i am very pleased this product ... shoots well all types different light conditions , even when it pitch black 430ex takes decent shotat close range ... 430ex adds deeper color warmth pictures conditions where light lacking ... i am graphic designer need great photo when i begin work 430ex helps process more clear colorful photo when shooting my rebel eos xt digital camera ...	1
it works great , there just two issues . when you lock it hot shoe , it very , very difficult unlock ( you twist wheel tighten it ) when batteries my camera low , camera flash start computer problems act very strange ( i cannon digital rebel xt ) . other than those towo issues , which comparison seem very small me , flash fantastic ! lightweight easy use	1
i using my new canon lens during 4th july rodeo redlodge montana . although i pretty far bull horse riders gate , all my photos sharp no blur al	1
i've only this lens few days i say it impressed me . it drawbacks , needs lots light somewhat heavy . i would not like carry all day , but my need it isn't problem . i couple photos display taken first day i purchased lens . it very overcast day i think they turned out reasonable weather . my test home when sun popped out outstanding . push pull adjustment i see no problem it . i think little more experience it very good purchase my budget . i know there higher quality lens but price becomes issue , when you amature hobbiest like i am . i would recommend any one who likes take wildlife photos . 5 star rating money quality it very good lens !	1
reviews this lens web mixed some showing soft results , particularly 400mm . this likely due wide variations sample lenses . i decided take chance seem gotten lucky . my copy , just received amazon ( build date oct 2005 ) produces fantastically crisp contrasty images my 20d all focal lengths 100 400 . it almost magical . images much sharper using same f-stops than those 70-200 2.8 lens 100-150mm virtually same 200mm . even wide-open 400mm this lens quite sharp . 400mm , i've compared very nice canon 400mm 5.6 prime lens , without 1.4 teleconverter . images virtually same extreme sharpness contrast if zoom stopped down just one one-third stop ( e.g. zoom 6.3 , prime 5.6 ) . 1.4 tc both lenses manually focused but produced outstanding clarity no perceivable loss quality . focus swift true this lens really works ( not hum like 70-200 2.8 ) allowing handheld shots 1/100 sec 400mm . it may canon quietly improved this lens since recent reviews seem much more positive than those few years ago . some folks don't like push-pull zoom but it works great me allows very fast composition scenes . lens same size 70-200 2.8 but seems lighter better balanced . given razor sharpness its images 100-400mm range , this seems like perfect single lens solution nature bird photography . however , it big white so it may not best candid people photography .	1
i think i may found perfect camera bag . this one comfortable wear all day , it holds my alpha 100 my kit lens , my 100-400 lens both lens hoods . my battery charger , manual , misc cables , wallet , phone , misc items such small rain jacket . it also little pocket your memory cards . best part this bag you swing it around front pull your camera out without sit it down or showing everything you bag . bag plain enough most people wouldn't know you camera all equipment goes it . which big plus women traveling alone	1
works advertised . you screw it end your lens , there you go	1
this fantastic lens . it takes crisp , rich photos , large apperature makes impressive low-light photography , includes usm technology lightening-fast focusing . since i am only serious hobbyist , i can't yet afford quality canon lens ... but 2 years i perfectly happy leave this lens camera ( 10d ) . portraits , landscapes , indoor shots no flash ... it them all ease , photos look grea t.t his lens little heavy , combined my 10d weight certainly consideration . but me it feels well-balanced camera , i like substantial feel lens-camera combination gives . if you plan use flash , remember this big lens built-in flash may not clear barrel ( especially 10d , before canon redesigned pop-up flash ) ... might want think external flash head hot shoe . there lot glass front this lens , don't forget uv filter little extra protection	1
this great lens . pictures i take very sharp alive color , brokeh excellent . i am big fan keeping shallow depth field when shooting people or animals , so f/ 2.8 helps out . also dim wedding receptions no problem even weak built flash my rebel xt . autofocus practically silent , accurate very fast . if you don't think you need f/ 2.8 , go 24-105mm f/4 . it extra 35mm telephoto end , image stabilization , lighter smaller	1
this lens worth every penny i paid it . no matter what settings , wide-open or not , end zoom range or not , you get sharp contrasty picture . however , not expect it beat prime - even cheap 50mm 1.8 ( i also own ) ( somewhat ) better sharpness contrast , visible only when enlarged though . what you pay big bucks convenience	1
used this lens deer stand while hunting , sporting events ( indoor outdoor ) concerts . fast focusing great image stabilization ( use quite bit more power , though ) . not one problem it . solid build little heft it . it bit pricey , but i chaulk up it best market . would recommend it anyone looking top shelf lens .	1
this canon lens upholds tradition fine products canon line photographic accessories . it takes very clear , sharp , hand held pictures image stabilizer capability activated . it negates necessity carrying tripod every time one wants take long telephoto shots . it should must any serious photographer wanders countryside , taking candid pictures , wants lighten load equipment carried	1
wonderful camera . very flexiable , very versitile . most wonderful creation device someone whom capable . def good buy now 30d out . i've this camera over year i still love it	1
this camera really great . i knew i liked it before , but i immediately began appreciate this camera all more when i ended up rebel xt " loaner " while my 20d repair . not xt bad camera , it just doesn't really compare 20d . 20d nice feel it ; it fairly large , which great since i somewhat large hands . features great too . image quality awesome . i don't really need go into all details , most other reviewers excellent job . let me just say it great camera worth five stars . only complaint i camera it doesn't spot metering . ability your light metering off single point interest would great - they add it 30d .	1
i bought this camera 2 months before my son born . i knew little digital slrs , but after research i found this one me . this camera well constructed durable . pictures excellent . i blown few my pictures up 11x17 without any problem . also , if you going doing any editing photos your computer , this camera would great . i would recommend purchasing newest version photoshop or photoshop elements ( when i bought mine it only came elements 2.0 3.0 already market ) . also , if you want your pictures turn out , you must purchase larger flash . onboard flash weak , leave shadows it not allow you any type " bounce " flash . whole , this best camera i ever my life it would great anyone who previous experience slr cameras .	1
aside form fact canon charges arm leg 1 dollar piece plastic , remote switch work well . it not feel very sturdy not seem nearly well built canon cameras . people big hands may little trouble using this product . overall , " must " addition anyone interested long exposures , images excellent sharpness depth field	1
rs-80n3 works advertized . cable could longer but other than i am totally pleased	1
good quality , perfect attach , but no cord avoid loose it . incredible canon forget it !!! so ... remember put it inside your pocket when you use your camera	1
it seems unfair compare this camera 10d ( or 20d or 30d ) , either favorably or unfavorably . these instruments good their own right , but hardly same league 1ds mark ii . i used all three xxd , original 1ds body well . it occurs me folks who interested shelling out over 5 grand camera already idea what they want , some them asking if they should trade their 1ds body mark ii . it them i am adressing this review . remarks , i think help those who less experience line . bear me technical jargon emphais mark i vs ii comparison . i want help buyer decide if there really reason spend this kind money . first , regarding resolution : you probably won't able tell difference mark i mark ii unless you doing studio work . 8x10 image virtually indistinguishable . most us shoot . jpg mode , we don't mess raw . if you doing 17x20 wedding portrait working uncompressed files , mark ii superior . i outdoor work , so 11.6 megapixels plenty . finallyl , quality glass makes big difference ( much more than sensor resolution ) , so if you little strapped cash , buy 5d spend difference " " series lenses , or used 1ds ( mark i ) . second : ergonomics . i like histogram mark ii better than older camera , appreciate improved burst performance , storage times . small but significant differences . battery life way better , i like . i get 700 frames out charge mark ii only 200 mark ii . thank you , canon . maybe next iteration they something black brick charger . i only hope . third : sensor noise . most ofthe high-end cameras cmos now , each time we look new generation pictures we wowed decrease sensor noise high iso . i remember we praised mark i low noise up asa 400 . uninitiated , sensor noise random firing sensor due quantum effects , manifests sparkle or random changes pixel color . it more prominent low light high asa . mark i great up asa 400 , good up 800 needs some digital filtering 1200 . mark ii really good up asa 1600 , photoshop filter good 3200 . if you shoot low light , mark ii you . fourth : color balance . i always loved warm , saturated pictures mark i gives , so don't get me wrong - better color rendition not reason sell it new model . mark ii , though , improves it gives beautiful color saturation some improvement range highligts . digital photo buffs know what i mean : if you take picture broad highlights , like sky , foreground objecst underexposed . highlights clear . set exposrue foreground , sky burnt-out white . mark ii improved this much , but it still needs some work canon . now , it helps taken large number pictures get idea how set exposure . fifth : accuracy exposure . mark i annoying tendancy overexpose stop . i got used turning down exposure 1-2 stops , exposing highlights , using photoshop correct exposure . mark ii more accurate , manual exposure close metered exposure . sixth : ff/ 1.6 business . i really don't see any reason 30d better camera because 50mm lens gives image analagous 85mm lens full frame camera . advised , though , lens evaluations depend this distinction . edge performance flair may more obvious full frame instrument . both 1ds 1ds mark ii tend challenge lenses more because they work full range lens side side through apertures . my 35-135 canon lens gave great pictures 10d , but looks washed out both 1ds . before giving 1ds mark ii bum rap less than perfect pictures , ask what lens used . seventh : price . presently , non-grey-market 1ds mark ii sells around $6899 reputable dealers . used mark i around half . i would take half star away canon pounding my pocketbook taking , but i understand mark i just same price when it released . price gradient presently would tolerable those shooting low light , or raw studio work . personally , i would buy mark i over 5d improved construction . finally , some general remarks . i would liked compare this fine camera comparable nikon . unfortunately , i cannot , because all my glass canon , i no money left mul t-t housand buck purchase nikon . maybe someone else would write review . my only beefs canon sensor dust , seems appear spontaneous generation , steep learning curve i my first use . ( plan night or two reading manual ) i guess i forgive them not putting flash it . add couple hundred price purchase 580ex . canon service terrific . if you bucks , quit complaining price get one if you serious photographer . look images dpreview.com ( long , thoughtful review there ) , fredmiranda.com - they leave you breathless . this serious instrument serious photographers far it me give it less than 5 stars my petty complaints	1
i think this best buy anyone , superfast , flexible ( 50-3200 asa ) interchangeble lenses , long last battery , all excellent , only bad thing high price but it worth it , its like ferrari , almost you want keep it home case something bad happens like stolen or damaged even some people say big size inconvinencie i personally would not like tiny camera professional photographer it woud look ridicoulous , so size good thing also , when people even dont know camera impressed stuff it	1
i've using these rebel xt since two weeks . friday i went show local bar took 600 shots medium low light conditions ( just small stage lights lighting up band ) finally killed battery after 2 1/2 hours/600 shots	1
i find canon batteries work very well . i also not mind not using aa - extra nb-2lh small easy carry around - easier than several aa ( rechargable or not )	1
i honestly don't see why people would give this camera less than 4 stars . moment i got it , i delighted quality pictures ( except very dark places - which why review gets minus 1 star ) , its portability . i've dropped it , abused it , took it countless parties , countries it now full scratches bumps ( get camera case ! ) , guess what : it still works perfectly first day i got it . this little piece technology amazing , so if you're looking something affordable great picture quality ( us amateurs , course ) just go it . actually , i even took quite few gorgeous pictures it . i even love it rely it so much i won't change it even now it looks all messed up . don't think twice . just go it	1
this great product . i rather large lens it helps stabilize it so i don't blur my pictures when i'm taking pictures kids playing soccer . however , people think i'm professional photographer local newspaper when i use it grandkids ' games .	1
i very pleased amazons quick delivery my new canon monopod . monopod very easy adjust use . it ideal ridgid support you would want your camera . it even doubles great walking stick , sometime need , those long treks you make get good photo	1
... there two things you should know . first f/ 2.8 version this lens big heavy . second f/ 2.8 version this lens more versatile , therefore , more useful two choices . why f/ 2.8 more useful ? it allows you use canon outstanding extenders still sharp practical lens . 1.4 , you very , very good 98-280mm f/4 lens . 2x , you good 140-400mm f/ 5.6 lens . both cases lens autofocus -- very well 1.4 adequately 2x . use canon extenders also allows 70-200 make pretty nice close-up lens . original close focus lens maintained extenders , giving you both 280mm 400mm focal lengths focus closer than most prime lenses same focal lengths . while you use extenders f/4 version , it makes some pretty slow lenses limited applications . there not much you say this lens hasn't already said . it one sharpest zooms around look , while certainly subjective , highly appealing . i preference prime lenses over zooms but i still rank this one my sharpest lenses . there any reason choose 70-200 f/4 lens over this one ? cost aside , i see valid argument made f/4 . carrying around f/ 2.8 full camera bag no fun unless you're putting it use . since i mostly use shorter focal length prime lenses , sometimes f/ 2.8 pain neck me -- literally . unless i know i need it , i taken leaving it behind favor lighter , smaller less sharp canon 100-300 . so i see utility smaller 70-200 . maybe i talk myself into owning both . nah , that little too excessive .	1
this probably canon best value mid/long zoom . i got this same day i purchased my 30d ... ef-s 10-22 ef 24-70 2.8 . talk pleased ! no regrets whatsoever . this lens just screams quality . images just pop out you . if you're considering f/4 model ... take hard look this one . add hood ( cha-ching ) ( yikes ) $100+ tripod ring value this lens really shows . it bit larger heavier but look what you gain ! if you're one those considers sweet spot lens stopped down step or two just look where puts you f/4 compared this one . focus speed nothing short " holy mackerel that fast ! " sure , you could spend few more bucks get version ... but frankly , me least , if it important i'll using tripod anyway . hmmm , just took shakes out equation . all all , great lens decent price	1
i got this cord mainly macro work so i could use long macro lenses my flash without deal lens shadow picture . it also very nice able control direction lighting placing flash above , below , or beside subject . red eye also almost entirely reduced moving flash further away camera body , so this cord helpful portrait work . it could little longer , but longer it gets more difficult it would pack it small spaces , so all-in-all i think they pretty good job . it works fine , if you want all your flash functionally , but don't want it hotshoe , this good choice	1
there not much say this , since there no other alternatives me . simply stated , i went lowest price i could find .	1
i use this all time my son soccer games get great shots . it little bigger side , but isn't too heavy image stabilization really helps out	1
this great lens used almost everything . it great if you only want take one lens you . pictures very sharp color good	1
i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
i started battery grip initially wanting double battery availability . used 35mm hand strap already realizing value stability such strap , this my second attraction purchase battery grip last but not all least , ability use shoot grip itself , allowing full ease rotation camera . though i never used battery magazine allows use aa batteries , it offers backup should canon batteries need charging i am heat shooting . i always travel my charge four aa batteries . i would recommend this grip standard accessory eos-20d eos 30-d . one thought consider once camera it increases overall height creating challanges some camera cases .	1
i just attached my battery grip my 300d first time today , difference amazing . i already extra battery pack , so i charged them both up slid them right away . added weight very nice addition 300d small body , i already see improvement my ability hold camera still . it also makes camera feel much sturdier . i seen few reviews complain fitting . i not problem . connection seemless me , there no shimmy what-so-ever when i 70-300 lens attached camera tripod . so maybe this accessory optimized xt ? i love extra shutter button well , it makes taking picture portrait orientation extremely comfortable easy . buttom almost exactly same actual shutter camera well , which makes it easy go button button . after reading all hype this accessory , i forced myself buy it , i not dissapointed ! i recommend it anyone using xt . buy it now or else	1
i just upgraded 20d , speed just blows 20d out way !! image quality runs same both cameras since they're both 8.2 mp , but how camera gets you those images simply amazing . fastest shutter out there , low noise , consistent color , spot metering , multiple spot metering , weather sealing , list goes !! this camera demands best glass , but you won't sorry . if your serious photography any field , this camera won't disappoint !! bit pricey , but believe me , it worth every penny !!!! see some my work ( ...	1
this tool transforms my drebel xt tiny little viewfinder into usable one . it 1.25 setting it shows clear picture 100% coverage what viewfinder shows . 2.5 , coverage much less but setting very handy very critical manual focussing jobs . remember set your camera diopter it default factory setting . otherwise , flipping angle finder 1.25 2.5 magnification requires re-adjustment finder diopter . big advantage this little device it gives you freedom try exciting angles ( hey , they don't call it angle finder nothing ) without breaking your neck . only minor downside initial learning curve getting adjusted image shown finder .	1
just use this protect lens . good cheap alternative scratched lens	1
yes , it overpriced , just like any specialty item . yes , screw attachment bottom camera useless . but when you need fast recycle times or hundreds flashes go , cp-e3 invaluable . you strap case light stand or flash bracket , coiled cord length adequate these uses . i use elegantly compact really right stuff flash bracket which no place attach cp-e3 , so battery back without its case slips into my shirt or pants pocket . case could also strapped your bel t.t he unit little weighty 8 rechargeable aa batteries aboard , i'd hate see how many pieces this plastic gizmo would break into if i dropped it hard surface . top tunnel strap hang it something , strap should included . i made loop some hiking boot shoelaces ( which i also make zipper pulls ) i hang it knob light stand when shooting studio set-up . without short recycle times cp-e3 allows , my 580ex flash would gotten only one shot my daughter bowing after playing her piece piano recital . instead , i got three . decide yourself how important kind thing	1
i bought this because i needed top recycle speed my 550ex flash unit without spending huge bundle . i shoot karate demos my eos rebel digital , lots fast action rather large space ( meaning many full power flashes ) . digital rebel set iso800 mode flash set +1 stop exposure i adequately cover action basketball court sized gymnasium . using this battery pack 2000mah aa sized batteries ( 6.50 set 4 walmart ) i've taken over 400 pictures no slow down cycle speed . this particular pack uses 8 aa cells compatible lithium ion cells . older version this unit used 6 cells i believe , not compatible lithium ion batteries . unit very simple . box light it , space strap ( though none included ) slide out battery tray locking button course connector coiled cord hooks into side flash unit . i'm sure they it reasons resistance , but cord kinda short , thus limiting you where you hang battery package . if your tripod socket free they include screw designed mount battery package bottom camera ( kinda useless if you ask me ) . battery box comes fairly nice padded nylon case includes velcro strap , this what i use hang battery package camera or bag strap it works fine . eventually i'll get around finding something i use strap worry me less ( 8 batteries this thing it bit heavy trusted velcro if you ask me ) . unit works way it intended but i think price exhorbitant hunk plastic , price should half what it . if you can't go all-out buy top end rechargeable battery or true professional ( what they used call 512 ) battery package then this enough most us	1
my first lens . very sharp solid build . canon dr amazon gc , you get it lower $400 !!	1
like canon ef 17-40 f4l usm , this it sister $100 cheaper boot ! excellent images f4 ! outstanding images f9 . lightweight combination canon 5d . even lighter more compact combination canon digital rebel t.t he only gripe i purchase optional expensive tripod collar ring . ring add bit noticeable weight . since i am not steady shooter , i upgrading canon ef 70-200 f4l usm when it available november this year . least tripod collar ring should fit newer weathersealed lens .	1
this lens i use most often . it unbeatable portraits low-light photos indoors etc . it very sharp relatively light small . i also found it useful aerial photography . i used 50 mm 1.8 but upgraded because i like extra low-light power 1.4 ( which i often use ) one-touch usm manual focus distance scale ( which just nice-to-have ) . said , 1.8 great lens too	1
when i worked photojournalist many years ago , 50mm " standard " lens it came closest real world perspective , especially street photography . no longer always true because field-of-view crop many cameras . canon popular digital rebel its successors , example , 1.6 view turns 50mm lens into 80mm lens . 1d mark ii 1.3 view makes it 65mm lens . so , if you're looking standard lens today , 35mm probably closer mark those cameras . canon couple options there - 35 f/ 1.4 great expensive 35 f/2 good value $250 . if you're still looking 50mm , however , there now four options canon : 50/ 1.2 , 50/ 1.4 , 50/ 1.8 50/ 2.5 . here pros cons each : 50/ 1.2 newest , fastest most expensive $ 1,600 . it " " lens , which means it more durably constructed than any others . image quality cut above all others , especially wider apertures . if money no object , you'll probably want this one . but most rest us ask question whether it 5x better than 1.4.50 / 1.4 maligned some softness its images f/ 1.4 , but me its good , compact , low-light lens terrific price ($325 ) . lens gets sharp quickly you stop it down . it sharp f/2 very sharp f/ 2.8 good contrast colors . 50/ 1.8 step down 1.4 speed , image quality , build quality smoothness noise its autofocus . but it big step up value - decent lens $80 . if you're just getting into digital photography , this great lens learn until you get better feel lenses you want/need . 50/ 2.5 - this macro lens , although you use it general photography , too . i wouldn't recommend it . if you're doing macro photography , spend little more 100/ 2.8 , which sharper lens gives you more subject distance . if you're looking standard lens , you'll appreciate wider aperture 1.4 . all said , 50mm canon lenses , i think 50/ 1.4 still offers best mix image quality value .	1
this works just described . long flash i-red beams see eachother it works fine ... but radio controlled flash much better	1
i chance compare it tokina glass . canon better contrast better distortion , same or even slightly worse sharpness , complete looser build quality . if you ok 12mm - get tokina	1
exceptional portrait lens both digital film , nikkor 85mm f/ 1.8 usably sharp wide open tack sharp time you stop down even just bit . relatively small very light , it feels just right my hand . steve mccurry one my favorite photographers i happy discover many his great shots taken this lens . also , if you shoot manual focus body like f3 , you'll like solid but smooth feel focus ring . 85mm comes metal , screw-on hood . my preference plastic bayonet mounts , but i find i don't need hood often since this lens doesn't tend flare . two minor complaints this lens : first , bokeh not exceptional . that ok ; i'm not bokeh hound . but when i see creamy out focus specular highlights 85mm f/ 1.4 produces , sometimes i dream spending extra money . second , i wish it af-s . but even without af-s , it focuses faster than you'd expect . finally , construction solid . i've used it heavily two years deserts , jungles , glaciers ( ok , less glamorous places like around apartment ) it still looks brand new . short , my favorite lens . absolutely worth every penny	1
this same charger came my digital rebel , however , i like charge two batteries time . so , i bought second charger place them side side power strip . prongs outlet fold over into back charger making charger very compact , flat easy take you . it nice charger without long cords fuss .	1
i am thrilled this lens capabilities pictures it . i test shot corner window determine if it would good my insect shots i like so well . well , it great it came but i found i wanted 1/1 capability so i bought add-on converter am thrilled added both these necessary items my set-up . i like nature photography best like use my off summer days hiking finding photographs take perhaps well-known places but finding unique angles subjects what i like specialize . this lens greatly enhance your experience ' little world ' we commonly trod over or weed-ate away . i built diffuser using ping-pong ball over flash so lighting would work better . ( works great , btw ) . usual , it great canon glass trick	1
first i not this lens yet but i am buying it . it reportedly excellent lens very little distortion edges ( which why i'm buying it ) . i update this review after i lens , however , i feel people should warned big error well received review because it only lead frustration . not listen john kwok suggestion buy canon 60mm macro lens unless you you own 20d , 300d , or 350d/rebel xt . lens ef-s lens september , 2005 it only fit those cameras - it not optimized all canon dslr he states . other hand , 50mm macro here fit all canon 35mm film cameras all digital slr .	1
i love this camera . it my second canon , 7mp , best value money i've seen . i took it france this summer loved fact i could recharge battery overnight while my friends constantly changing their batteries ( searching places buy them ! ) . my favorite option " scene " button . i don't think i'll ever try " underwater " option , but " night shot " " inside shot " work fantastically . it also seems though you take movies until card or battery fail - which huge improvement over my older canon . unlike lot newer cameras , this one viewfinder . friend mine nikon no viewfinder it extremely hard use bright sunshine . i carried my camera my purse without case few days ago new orleans without problem - it worked like charm . i would recommend this camera anyone who wants easy-to-use model produces fabulous results .	1
it working well , it sturdy . i dropped ground when playing frisby , but nothing happened	1
first amazon thanks great service delivering our item . it works fantastic . we very satisfied it .	1
i don't much stuff , but fits all my dslr gadgets plus my camcorder . fits - my canon xti my canon 50 mm attached . - my kit lens- my new canon 70-300 is- my panasonic video cam- minor accessories ( extra batteries , cables , memory cards , etc)there separators velcros inside , so you configure bag however you want i t.t he only issue i this bag i wan't able configure it store my xti my 70-300 attached	1
this camera bag just i expected . what written description fits it perfectly . nice bag ! great response time delivery . thanks	1
jim . made great review ..... i just wanted let you know i agree . this great . it very light weight . only reason why i gave it 4 stars you need zoom bit or else you get burnout effect ( circle where corners dark because it getting inside lens ) . annoying , forces you remove extender when you want take closer photos . distance though , it great . pictures come out great . i highly recommend this ..... i would given it 4.5 stars if it option	1
pros : - reduces flare ghosting when shooting bright light . - helps protect your lens dirt scratches . - somewhat protects lens case fall . better break hood than front element . - makes you look more like you know what you doing helps keep others carelessly walking front you . cons : - increase lens movement windy situations , kind like sail boat . - takes up more room your bag , even when reversed they still add diameter lens . - people take more notice you , help blow your cover if you trying keep low profile .	1
i bought this hood canon 85mmf 1.8 lens , one incredible lens . years ago i went lecture ernst wilde , mr . hasseblad himself , where he showed difference lens hood would make hasseblad lens . since then i always used them faithfully every lens i own . longer lens , more efective lens hood if it specifically designed lens . this hood canon their medium telephoto lenses , 85f 1.8 , 100usm macro , 135mmf 2.8 lenses . hood protect your lens dust , scratches , damage , while same time preserving maximum contrast your lens deliver . this differs filter , take away inherit lens sharpness contrast . analogy wearing baseball cap which improve your vision protect your eyes cataracts , while not distorting your vision like sunglasses	1
this product works really well , price great . i am always pleased quality kodak	1
kodak made printing pictues simple 123 . paper cartridge snaps place quite easily . it removed quickly stored out way because paper protected its own tray convenient lid . this high quality paper protective coating applied photo give it many years durability . i thought price competative other methods printing photo paper	1
now , this isn't fastest card market . but it solid , reliable card . camera itself bottle kneck , typically not this card . however , if you using canon dslr recent flavor , i would check if it needs rma'd . known quantity these cards proven lose images . scary . however , i've not experienced mysterious loss images my card or rebel xt . i've only ever pushed cards speed limits my pd70x , definately not my rebel xt	1
i would not able imagine shooting without sb-800 , it just so integral my photography . my only gripe ttl preflashes which cause some people blink half-blink time main flash goes off . but you easily get around this using fv lock . fill flash perhaps most excellent function sb-800 . i usually stop it down - 1.3 ev - 1.7 ev get imperceptable results	1
bought it together d50 , 6 month ago . simply best choice digital nikon slr , superior compared high-end flashes analog nikon cameras . within range up 60feet this flash brighten very smooth , no red eyes , press focus perfectly . but you need 5th battery , you better spent money high-end batteries , don't use " consumer-type " rechargeable ones . they last very short time only , not enough fill 1gb card !	1
just bought my first slr ( d50 ) my first external flash ( sb-800 af ) . i didn't know what expect , but i amazed ! i could take flash into very dark ( mostly candle lit ) large ( 40'x65 ' ) room take shot looked like daylight . far speed , its amazing - i shoot off 12 shots continuous mode my camera flash keep up ( sometimes it miss shot or two - still trying figure one out ) . so far , i couldn't more pleased	1
this flash working great me . it amazing recycle time . i able easily fire off multiple shots indoors low light without missing beat . i also used it completely dark room , all worked great . i don't like locks bounce head , it necessary press release side prior tilting . just minor annoyance	1
camera handles very well - it light drives my zoom lens 18-55mm lens beautifully . i get professional photographs use it all day without suffering heavy weight , which it not . view finder excellent readout back camera extremely helpful , showing photos they taken - zoom back screen , which immediately gives me idea photo i want use my books . i say this outstanding lens camera .	1
this lens outstanding . speed sharpness top-notch . i use this lens wide array situations it always delivered impressive results . best lens it class reasonable price . it well built , sturdy , not so heavy so it relatively easy carry around . canon really impressed me this lens . i use it my eos system ( traditional digital cameras ) .	1
i bought this camera gift my 16 yr old daughter who takes lots fun pictures her friends . her photos great quality . this dependable camera , takes abuse teenager gives it . i love it all those reasons besides great pics	1
time this writing , there something wrong product shot amazon site : it makes lens look much shorter than it reality . it not large or heavy lens all , but it not _that_ short . i've mine ( part 20d kit ) year , during which i've taken maybe 4000 frames or so particular lens . lens still appears solid it day 1 , so no complaints departmen t.t he image stabilization ( ) feature works quite well surprisingly silent ( far more so than system ef 70-300mm ) . said , good fraction focal length range , relatively minor ( but still useful ) benefit this lens . autofocus ( af ) speed okay : better than kit lens came original digital rebel i used own , but not fast some other lenses i ( all non-l ) . af accuracy fine my copy . optically , my concern primarily sharpness . department , lens seems only marginally better than 18-55mm kit lens came original digital rebel ( which bought close $100 , i believe ) . it often worth turning off improve things , ironically . still , it not awful . i haven't found vignetting , distortion , flare , aberrations significant hindrances . part , probably due workflow includes dxo pro images i care . overall , i think this still pretty good choice lens keep default canon ef-s camera ( 30d , 20d , or digital rebel variant ) . optical performance over lower-end ef-s 18-55mm lens not _that_ great , but feature set may justify premium . higher end ef-s 17-55/ 2.8 alternative if you're willing double your investment change lenses get longer focal range : its imaging quality larger aperture certainly desirable . tamron sigma some offerings this range too , but i'm not all familiar them	1
i got this lens replace kit lens came my canon eos 30d . this lens definitely more " substantial " lens than kit lens . even though outer housing plastic , it metal mount seems very durable sturdy . really helps improve image quality induced my unsteady hand . usm very fast quiet . i read accounts this lens not able lock , but i not any issues it varying ( including low ) lighting conditions . i know lens supports ftm focus , but i not tried it yet . i like focal length range this lens . 17mm even 1.6 multiplier , angle very wide . only drawback this lens me 17mm there significant barrel distortion . my test shots my next shot 24mm distortion completely gone this focal length . it not showstopper though since it easily corrected photoshop . all lenses i plan get , ( sigma 30mm 1.4 , canon ef 50mm 1.8 ii , canon ef 70-300mm usm ) , this most likely lens i keep camera most time , using others opportunities warrant	1
i bought 2 these carry camera support suspended over treadmill filming above . i love fact they extend 70 " . they very sturdy hook central post i could hang sandbag additional support . furthermore , support beams each leg central post attached central ring tighten change size base support measured distance legs tripod . this extremely helpful when you limited floor space tight or cramped corners . addition sandbags , this narrow base support still quite stable . additional bubble levels stand enormously helpful rough terrain . locking mechanims legs plastic , however thus not very good outdoor , dusty conditions . they very much like samsonite 3751 same camera release mechanism , locking legs , bubble levels , extendable center post , changeable size base suppor t--t he differences : cheaper , greater extension , hook center post , carrying case	1
i needed this tripod use my 20x50 binoculars since least movement 20x magnification causes subject wind up outside viewing field . this tripod works well use . it sturdy , lots features reasonably priced . however , if you wish use tripod binoculars , right angle adapter needed . i found one ebay few dollars .	1
i little hesitant purchase this tripod because low price . last cheap tripod i bought lightweight wobbly . i am very pleased performance this tripod . i wasn't expecting bogen type quality , but its good enough . it lightweight , surprisingly sturdy . i would recommend this tripod friend	1
we traded up original rebel xti . this first add-on we purchased great ! battery grip adds some balance overall sturdy-feeling rebel ... especially , slightly smaller xt xti bodies . good stuff , no regrets	1
i read rave reviews opteka battery grip manufactured same specs canon grip but fraction price , so i knew i couldn't go wrong it . it came two 3rd party batteries well only $20 more , so what i lose ? let me start off saying i experience 3rd party batteries they usually waste money they horrible performance standpoint . not these however , i taken few hundred pictures 20% flash battery meter still full . great value overall . grip really balance out small size rebel xt always stays my camera . it add considerable weight camera however , but nothing overbearing	1
i previously owned kodak easy share died while i vacation . i loved easy learn use features camera so i wanted camera easy non-professional use . this little camera great ! i've it few months now love pictures ! it very easy use super small which makes it easy throw my purse take anywhere . pictures crisp clear battery lasts forever . my old kodak used take real aa batteries i thought camera its own little rechargeable battery might strange but it actually much easier lasts way longer than aa my old kodak . lcd screen huge makes it very easy review photos . just one little click go review back taking photos . only two downfalls i've found so far little setting dial moves easily its own so you always check it before taking picture or it might some strange setting or video . other thing i haven't able figure out if there way delete all photos camera after you upload them - i've delete them one one which slow process . other than those two little things this camera wonderful ! highly recommended	1
this outstanding camera it size . easy use , easy carry produces great pictures . would recommend anyone who ready give up film go digital	1
when i bought this camera sales people tried get me buy battery . they said one came it would only good 20 minutes . now i bought alot items my lifetime , 20 min battery camera just doesnt seem like very good " business " choice . so i said no . so i got camera , charged battery until light went green ( which sucked because i wanted play it right when i got it ) started taking pictures ( oh i also got 2g cf ) worked great .... so i planned go up mountain take soem scenery shots . keeping mind what sales person told me i pocketed charger just incase . well , 6000 ' , 300 pictures , 5 hours later camera still running strong , still 200 shots left trip home , battery life indicator hasnt budged off full button . so all all , i think battery life great , now i see if your taking say thousands pictures all row you may need but just going trip shooting few pictures every stop point , original work fine . quality photos ..... i love them	1
i digital cameras 5 years still own olympus 5 megapixel , casio 7 megapixel . seems like megamixels alone just don't cut it me . i read rebel xt magazine looked up user reviews here amazon . i decided go buy one though i am really novice , i am extremely impressed . i never seen such stunning quality or realistic colors point shoot . i started basic settings love results . i am slowly progressing more advanced settings am getting better everyday . even novice who just wants stunning photography amazed this camera . i also bought tamron 75-300 autofocus zoom lens ( look it here amazon.com ) after lots practice , able take some great pictures . i brother uk who also into digital photography , after seeing some ( full reso ) photos i sent him , he rushed out bought xti ( called eos 400d across pond)and amazed it . i still lot learn but really cannot fault this camera . included software also excellent . record , some reviews seem think it too small hold , i big hands don't any problems all . i admit though this first slr i ever owned . i still keep point shoot keep my travel bag spontaneous photography but i am love my rebel xt !! this camera costs quite chunk change but i think it well worth it i recommend it everyone	1
i've my d70s year now , haven't regretted it second . controls laid out logically , everything hand . dual control wheels make adjustments fast accurate . i personally love optional grid overlay , i no excuses horizons aren't horizontal . wireless flash system great , though you buy sb-600 or sb-800 get full benefit . this camera bigger heavier than d50 d80 , which my opinion positive thing .	1
great affordable camera , takes very nice pictures .	1
bought p880 month ago . i am sem-pro outdoor adventure photographer i use nikon 35mm film equipment most part . i shoot slide film my f90s nikon . i 5mp kodak digital camera but wanted upgrade better digital camera but i could not justify buying nikon d50 or d70s they only 6mp . i didn't want drop 2 grand d200 . so i looked mid-range camera lines . after doing much research , i decided buy this camera . so far i am happy i . i taken it hiking several times , enough i know its good camera but course its toy compared pro nikon film cameras . but i knew when i bought it . i wanted good camera take lots " documentary " , " fun " " travel " shots . really powerful stuff i still shoot slide film . but its too expensive shoot extensively!here my initial impressions based perspective outdoor photosgrapher : good : 1 ) fairly easy hold its tall actual grip . 2 ) lightweight ( but course expense impact resistance i'm sure ... ) 3 ) great set manual controls ! this best part . autobracket good interval timer which great self-potraits . you walk far away camera get yourself shot ( great solo hikers ) . 4 ) large 2.5 " lcd makes it easy check out your photos5 ) image quality seems pretty good ( although not comparable high-res . scan slide ) . 6 ) manual zoom great ! much better than power zooms almost all other cameras . 7 ) 24mm focal length simply amazing ! great landscapes outdoor adventure shots . 8 ) battery life great . shot 250 or so pics full charge included lot playing around menus , reviewing photos , etc . i just boughta second kodak battery amazon $16 ! 9 ) built flash pretty powerful you add shoe mount unit well . 10 ) 8mp resolution price 6mp camera . not so good : 1 ) seems write card pretty slowly . definately not action shots ! maybe this would improve if i bought faster sd card . 2 ) " toggle " button back navigating through menues worries me . seems like it could break someday . i am gentle it . wish they would create more durable feeling toggle . 3 ) lcd viewfinder hard see bright sunny day . this where film camera way better . optical viewfinders cannot beat . 4 ) screen manual focus no good all . better just focus your eyes . 5 ) wish they would made handgrip little grippier adding rubber stip or like . little slippery hands ( always use neck strap ! )in all i highly recommend this camera . if they improve upon some items which i some critisism , i would easily give this camera perfect review !! good luck your purchas	1
new nikon en-el3e battery slight update nikon en-el3 provided earlier dslr models such d70 . it adds contact allows new cameras determine how much charge left battery . battery grey distinguish it black en-el3 . en-el3e backwards compatible en-el3 : you put it your d70 or d50 . reverse not true . number pictures battery gives you depends lot factors , including shooting style , lcd usage , course , camera . ( 2.5 " lcd d200 use up battery much quicker than smaller d70 . ) it sufficient day shooting . unless you using d200 some professional capacity , which case , you'll probably investing least one backup battery	1
this my first very expensive entry into digit slr photography . i used canon point shoot digital camera previously . i avoiding dslr because i used rarely use my eos film slr . convienience point shoot experience overwhelming . unfortunately so it limitations . so back i came , only choice though expensive eos 5d it full frame sensor ! pain reduced double rebates . wow ! this revelation ! beautifull images , lot control . i notice af not fast my old elan iie . i also disappointed price there lack weather sealing . i am not happy canon this , but i really appreciate them making full frame sensor difficult marketable slot far their line up concerned . this camera also needs prime or lenses , because sensor reveal inadequacies inferior lenses . this add cos t.t his exceptional photographic tool i hope use improve my skill i explore all it capabilities	1
after 3 decades nikon 35mm film ' loyalist ' , co-worker let me test drive his canon 5d , canon ef 16-35mm 2.8 usm sandisk extreme iii 2 gb card . viewing images his lcd computer screen helped me decide sell almost everything nikon ( i kept their sb-800 flash wireless slave setups ) switch established dslr leader , canon . finally , no more heavy bulky nikon f5 pay wait film processing ! no more scanning negatives hours each night!i've owned 5d , canon ef 17-40mm f4l usm , canon ef 70-200mm f4l usm tripod collar canon speedlite 580ex 3 months taken over thousand raw large jpeg images iso ranging 50 3200 . ( note : 4 weeks ago , backup canon digital rebel xt black body added 70-200 . ) 5d image quality stunned every person i given 4 " 6 " 8.5 " x11 " colour monochrome images . credit must given canon digital photo professional ( dpp ) raw processing software , canon i9900 bubblejet printer , canon paper canon ink . i rarely use adobe photoshop cs2 anymore because dpp quick-to-use tools . above 5d any one lenses flash fits nicely into tamrac velocity 7 bag . larger velocity 9 bag fit entire 2 body lenses flash ki t.t he only negative camera closed compact flash card gate moves slightly it hinge giving body less than solid feel . digital rebel xt not this issue therefore feels more solid . built-in flash would nice but not absolutely necessary . unlike superb nikon sb-800 , canon 580ex bit chunky but it job wonderfully . low noise images iso above 800 easily removed dpp or photoshop . photoshop goes step further removing colour artefacts which lowers saturation image . meaning saturation would increased after noise removal . bottom line : if you believe it costs canon more manufacturer full-frame cmos image sensor don't mind spending several months salary 5d , go it ! also , choose your lenses carefully . canon lenses go well 5d .	1
while 5d may less expensive than so-called professional grade , camera more oriented toward pro end than 20d ( or 30d ) fewer dial settings but more capability . others covered some other areas , so i'll try avoid repetition . full frame makes great deal difference me . i like print large images i like use or other higher end canon lenses ( couple knockoffs ) . there no tradeoff weight consequence or compactness . truth i prefer recent glass isn't computed smaller sensor . i liked 20d , lot , most my gear carries over 5d . i now three cameras take same card battery . 5d if anything feels looks more rugged 20d while very compact . but pictures ? great . 20d first rate camera 8.2 its ability use all canon lenses , plus ef-s smaller digital image . one person cited slowness over 20d . i won't disagree , but it isn't big deal me . i typically use drive bracketing fly , but almost never anything just fast sequence , e.g. sports . i've owned motorr drives going back my days pro 60s 70s they their uses . esssential sometimes . but they like autofocus . occasion , you need manual . whenever possible , i prefer single shot or occasion , three shot burst . i find there less chance missing what i'm shooting . " decisive moment " too often falls frames motor driving . but that everyone taste . i really am impressed camera tried it , look forward trip it , trusty 20d second .	1
price , this excellent lens . aps sized sensor it equivalent 480mm long end . some complain it slow lense since max aperture full zoom 5.6 just means you can't use it low light expect great results . if you want fast lense length , however , prepared pay lot money . usm it focuses very fast . works well outdoor sports . my rating based what you get money . course it not good glass but it way less money	1
i just begun my interest photography this first zoom lense i ever bought . lense provided all i could ever ask . i just got back zoo kids photographes excellent	1
i bought this monopod after reading reviews here . it really light-weighted . i used it take pictures dance performace where tripod not possible . i able use slow shutter got great images . cons : i saw pro ( i knew he runs studio ) using similar monopod which black . so my only complain its non-black color . well i am not pro anyway .	1
this cable very essential need me upload my photos computer . i very fortunate find it amazon.co	1
this essential part digital picture taking . can't download pictures your kodak camera onto computer without it . it should come standard your camera purchase , but if you misplaced yours , this one get . arrived promptly ordered value great	1
why use case when this one built specifically this camera ? i like it , it sleek belt-mountable . also enough padding so you throw it backpack , suitcase , etc	1
after reviewing my options purchase my new canon a540 we chose this case i'm glad i ! nice snug fit camera , extra compartments memory card batteries , no need strap , you already provided one camera .	1
i've this camera three years . i bought it new , when it cutting edge very expensive . i put 128mb cf card it . first , i say i never slightest problem this camera or software . i've probably taken upwards 5000 pictures it , it all over country . software installed windows 95 , 98 , 2000 xp i haven't any problems it . camera solid , performs well , takes good pictures , battery lasts pretty long if you disable lcd viewfinder . if battery life big deal , one could purchase second battery rotate . all said , i am little disappointed quality pictures camera . they razor sharp , color balance perfect , focus great . when taking pictures people , however , it shows every flaw subject skin . scratches , oil , freckles magnified come out looking horrific . it requires extensive photoshopping fix flaws . other cameras taking pics same subjects turn out looking much better . i also say it takes very long moment camera its digital image processing time you press button when camera actually takes picture . time shot taken , something ( especially squirmy child or sports play ) invariably moved it not exact picture you wanted . i'm going buy real single-lens reflex ( slr ) take baby pictures , but i'll keep this travel camera	1
if you're professional photographer , you probably ignore this review . but then you probably won't thinking buying this lens anyway , you'll off purchase nice series . however , if - like me - you just happen nice canon digital rebel camera ( or equivalent ) enjoy taking decent pictures , this lens probably work out very well you . i've taken well over 1000 pictures it couple weeks , it performed very much expected . price , it perfect go-everywhere lens . few main points . okay , it not best image quality . even low/medium iso it seems little grainy its not sharp some more expensive canon lenses . it struggles indoors unless you good flash unit , but well-lit outdoor shoots it works very well . course , it would nice nice series , but if you can't afford then this very good value lens . not real professionals , but great if you don't take things too seriously just want bit more zoom - , let face it , who doesn't want but more zoom	1
i am railfan , very large range zoom important . shooting fly distant bridge shot closeup coming around bend . focuses quickly too . i canon 10d i hate changing lenses because it gets dust inside camera . this 28-200mm very practical my hobby , gets used waterfall other outdoor scenery too . one note interest , it hard get super-sharp background details this lens , compared any lenses or series lenses , ( buddy i shot same closeup shot ore dock way background dock details looked lot sharper his 28-135 lens ) . same camera , same settings . closeup focused object looked great both , just when looking out-of-focus objects , lenses seemed better . this lens worth price my opinion , superb amateurs hobby-photographers like myself . but those looking touch more distant details out focused field , 28-135 usm lens canon seems little step ahead this . series lenses , course , league their own	1
portraits sporting events , this wonderful multi-purpose lens . prior purchasing lens , i asked buddy mine ( photographer philadelphia flyers , nhl hockey team long time canon user ) if this quality lens . he told me go it it best buy money distortion spherical abberation extremely minimal this lens . truth told , i've never seen ef lens i didn't like	1
let face it . this great lens . but , i want warn you adorama . i highly recommend you choose better vendor . adorama slow . they don't respond emails . they took week ship my lens when they said it stock . their customer service non-existen t.t heir prices no better than anyone else . almost every time i've ordered them they contacted me try sell me more stuff . ( which further delays shipping)a totally unprofessional organization . i one never order them again . good luck if you	1
great using tripod , now you pictures too	1
this camera excellent one !! really when you compare its price its results level quality you get you know why this best its category , i'm getting very professional results using it lot styles .. highly recommended	1
i already digital rebel able sell it co-worker use proceeds my new rebel xt . faster , lighter , better . simple review . it took everything great my digital rebel made it better . some complain it feels " too light " ... ok ... it that your thing . me , it still solid pictures speak themselves . now , addition 10 mp rebel xt , i'll bet original xt purchased even better price . no downsides i think ..	1
best camera i ever owned . easy use even all features . don't afraid buy this one	1
i bought this battery replacement old canon bp511a . it lasted couple months before it started not taking charge . complete waste money	-1
super lightweight , sharp wide open , short minimum focus distance , fast af . decent bokeh . ability take pictures very low light , super cheap when compared it 35mm 1.4 $1000+ brother 1.6 digital its normal lens see some shots : http://www.pbase.com/2bruce/gillin	1
this delivered so fast it unbelievable . they sent exactly what pictured it works perfectly	1
nothing wrong this battery . personally i would prefer my camera use aa but battery life lithium ion batteries pretty good . no complaints here except price . but necessity made me purchase second one , not because my other one died , just cuz sometimes i need spare	1
battery works great , shipping amazon took too long . i purchased other items same day other retailers they delivered 5 days sooner than amazon item	1
i bought this my nikon d70 digital slr 18-70mm nikkor lens . it works great except lens cap not work polarizer filter . it works other three filters : nd4 , nd8 , uv . price still beats buying four filters individually . i like case also	1
i compared lot bags use my new nikon d50 . i wanted bag versatile could carried hikes . lowepro slingshot definitely bag my camera ! plenty room couple lens , battery charger , other small items .	1
this fit my olympus e500 great . i recently took overseas trip this bag great traveling go trips . weatherproof cover really came handy few time when it started rain unexpectly . only thing bit odd strap you wear around your body . it comes up chest odd angle , my husband didn't problem it but i . so maybe thats just girl thing .... :) most times i didn't use extra strap , just threw it over one shoulder went . bag held 2 lenses , extra battery , charger , i room keys , wallet few little personal odds ends . my friend so impressed it , he buying one today . some one asked if they attach tripod bag . there aren't really any extra loops outside bag . stadard tripod won't fit insidde . you would rig something up outside yourself . imo i don't it would work very well but you try .	1
i love this remote . i find it very convenient take self portraits night time long exposure shots . unfortunately i lost remote during my trip smokies still no clue how where - might slipped my pocket hurry . i ordered second one now . it so tiny you not feel weight or volume your pocket or camera bag . i wish it strap/thread or hole so it attached key chain or camera or etc .	1
this wonderful filter . clean your front element , place this filter it , now you never think it again . thread fit very good both ends it . canon 67mm cap fits front this filter perfectly . there even slight raised metal lip so cap doesn't sit against filter glass . well engineered , worth money	1
this my first review here . bought marine pack houseboat trip my sony dsc-n1 camera . it very solid feels great . somehow i mistakenly thought before obtaining it touchscreen could still used when camera installed . though that not accurate , good number other functionality retained ( you switch movie/camera/review modes , zoom , etc . ) . it worked very well trip , it took fantastic photos . we even took several movies going down water slides diving into water ( which isn't suggested manuals ) but still everything turned out perfectly . all all , i'd easily recommend this unit	1
i gave this camera my husband his birthday . it first digital camera we owned though my college age son his third one - all canon digital elphs . this such great little gadget - it smaller than pack cigarettes , big screen which view your photo(s ) , easy learn use , great taking trips - long you remember keep wrist strap your wrist while you using it so it doesn't drop break . i also purchased small canon digital printer which great us take our aging parents , take photos , print them immediately leave them our parents enjoy immediately . every canon product we own not disappointed us this little camera no exception !	1
it great compact camera good zoom . i now leave larger lens my nikon dx 70 use this closer shots . you need try different settings make sure you get color you want . i really like it most general quick shots , carry it wth me most time	1
it doesn't get any better this price point . excellent build quality , very easy use , intuitive . optics simply brilliant kit lense ( 135mm ) . went canon rebel film slr which i loved , but when i tried move into xti , there just no comparison xti d80 . you could immediately feel difference quality functionality . auto-clean feature absolute marketing crap canon . cmos shakes off dust , but then where dust go ? bologna feature , not mention flash nearly knocks your eye out when it pops up canon xti . d80 blows it away , it price there nothing out there better . if your market this price point , or relatively close , just go it . you not regret this purchase .	1
this camera awesome ! i upgraded my d50 better sensor more mp . wow - am i amazed increase quality . say goodbye digital look . extras lot fun i've only begun play . b/w various filters name one . very worth money	1
canon g6 great camera . i upgraded canon powershot a80 g6 . a80 showed me canon makes good camera , but lacking few features i really wanted . me , this camera perfect collection compromises . i want small camera family snapshots , that easy use . i want large , capable camera art work like portraits landscape , action shots like sports recreation . when i'm vacation , want some snaps kids goofing around or dinner or something , i don't need camera makes me jump through hoops get decent shot , i just want point shoot . full auto , or aperature priority , or shutter speed priority , pictures usually sharp crisp . set image size one medium or small settings you use high speed multi-shot feature get series action shots guarantee you'll get least few good ones . i no qualms setting this camera auto , handing this camera person little or no photgraphic experience , letting them click away . it easy enough learn most folks taking nice pictures less than hour , pros taking great pictures no time all . other hand , lot work i very artistic , involves using manual settings . when going perfect picture , it often necessary adjust focus , aperature , shutter speed get exact picture you want . this camera manual focus , feature i sorely missed my older powershot a80 . thing bothers me most other cameras , you wade through bewilderingly large collection menu options make smallest changes . while i understand using layer or two menus things like basic settings ( time , format cf card ) i can't see it something basic film speed or white balance . which why i love this camera . following items one button away : flash flash output levelmulti-imagetime delay photoautofocus areamacro modemanual focuswhite balancezoom / outfilm speed ( 50 400)picture mode ( auto , manual , manual preset 1 2 , av , tv , portratit , landscape , backlit , panorama , movie)my favorite things this camera : battery life excellent . i bought spare battery , but i've never actually use one came it less than day . it charges fast too . picture quality : larger lens allows better pictures low light conditions , it very clear . large ccd allows you get pictures large enough resolution print out fairly large copies them look very good . ergonomic . this very comfortable camera hold long time . it not quite same range some much more expensive units , but i've never gotten tired holding it . plus , all buttons you need hit while running it right there under your fingertips . scroll wheel under your right index finger very intuitive operate . push it change modes , roll it change settings . fold out screen allows you take pictures odd angles without ever lay down your back picture . plus , fold out screen feels very solidly built , not like it'll snap off your hands . i always worried my powershot a80 , it didn't feel very solid . it works well my computer , which runs linux . i use gtkam , great camera programit infrared remote used take pictures without worrying camera shake . this very useful group pictures you'd like yourself . user savable white balance settings . real flash shoe . this camera takes standard canon flash unit . manual focus mode puts close up center screen right middle picture you check focus . this would really bothsome composing pictures , except when you half depress shutter button , small zoomed square center disappears leaves you whole picture . rapid fire photo option very useful action shots , some candid stuff , like subway pictures . mechanical view finder more than just adornment this camera . it quite good , it changes its field view according current zoom setting . it also focus adjustment it . this very nice if you wear glasses , it lets you adjust view finder your eye , you get your eye right up it , not keep bumping your glasses into back camera . very wide open fstop 2.0 very closed off 8.0 . lastly , it remembers virtually everything you setup last time it or certain mode , reverts those settings next time you turn it or switch modes . this includes things like white balance , settings not remembered my powershot a80 . now negatives : door covers usb port / dc input , av output very easy catch swivelling / revolving fold out screen , screen takes fare bit effort revolve , it quite likely you'll snapped door half before you notice it gone gotten itself caught spinning lcd screen that passing . if it gotten little bent , it get caught every time fold out screen until you snap it off or bend it back place . flash way too close lens , which makes some pretty obvious shadows bottom right hand corner some photos . luckily , i'm not much flash usage , if i , i'd probably spring real flash sat hot shoe . still , if you're looking great built flash , this not camera you . slow focus , autofocus become confused objects within few yards , never really focus . plus , focusing pretty slow . if you looking camera very fast , nearly perfect autofocus , you might better camera . movies limited 3 minutes maximum , which seems rather arbitrary . even 5 minutes would big step up , it would allow me catch average musical performance one step . final word : this great compromise camera someone who really wants two separate cameras but can't afford them . it good snap shot camera , good big lense , big body , big ccd machine capable creating art . it not best either those categories when compared other cameras , but one both , it represents perfect compromise pretty reasonable price	1
i received lenses they all good quality . case comes them also very nice . i worried polarizing lens not working after reading other reviews , but mine worked fine .	1
these great filters especially price ! i looking just one uv filter , after stumbling upon this set which not much more than price one filter , i bought it . these great lenses . i especially like polarizing filter , but all 3 great . definitely worthy buy	1
this case perfect carrying protecting my camera . can't imagine not it	1
this case freaking awesome . i completely turned off 8 dollars shipping i pay , but it definetly worth it . this case looks so nice , so sleek , so beautiful it just feels good your hands . u love this case . i . borrow dollar 8 ppl if u just shipping	1
great kit , i use it lot . first , here what inside . small rocket blower - great little thing , tends whistle through red plastic tip though . so , it not great quiet places . retractable brush - great little thing , tends shed hairs , but not terribly . cleaning solution - i notice it lifted some color off multicoated lens . oddly , it only one lens , only once . lens looks fine , still takes sharp pictures without any flare . jury out , but i still use it w/o fear . cotton swabs - never used em , but they look nice . microfiber cloth - nice full sized cloth . very soft , great when buffing out spots	1
i absolutely love this camera . i've told everyone i know buy it . picture quality amazing . there so many options this tiny little camera ! you edit pictures before you even print them . zoom picture already taken save it way , so much more . i take pictures everything ! i charged battery when i got camera , which three weeks ago , it still going . i 7/8th battery life left . i haven't charge it again . i am so happy my purchase ! i hope this helps you	1
pros : - picture quality very good , but 7.2 megapixel picture 3mb wich pretty big thats reason you might want buy bigger memory card . - big 2.5 " lcd get you some attention bystanders around you . - video mode high quality very good ! this feature impressed me , i use it most ( depening occasion ) . this camera better resolution than my brothers sony camera recorder . some reason my baterry seems drain little faster than taking pictures . ( i own 2gb memory stick pro duo , wich enough record take pictures day , but i don't think battery hang in)cons : - there isn't many cons me , becuase i looking point shot camera 2.5 " lcd or 3 " - only thing i didn't like video mode you can't zoom while recording , other than this camera nice great pocket camera . - pictures come out blury times when you really shaky but sony pretty good image stabilization . ( this also great sport camera wich you capture pitures fast moving object .	1
this great camera traveling , it small enough fit into your top pocket , so it go anywhere . only problem i there no underwater housing it , if there i would given it 5 *	1
i bought this camera couple months ago because i wanted small digital camera would easy carry me . since then , i've found s5i wonderful camera takes clear colorful pictures easily fit your pocket . here some praises s5i : 1 . this camera tiny . it smaller than my cellphone . this makes it extremely easy bring when going trip or just out day . i it my pocket all times , ready capture any moment . i brought it recent trip everybody thought it great . end day we hooked it up tv hotel watched slide show day . everyone loved it . 2 . battery life incredible . i this thing couple months i only charged it like 4 times . even extended use flash screen , battery still keeps kicking . very different my cellphone ! 3 . super macro focus setting creates beautiful photos . this something i didn't realize camera until after i bought it . you get right up things take these really colorful crisp images . flowers plants look incredible . 4 . red-eye reduction best i've ever seen . red-eye flash mode , camera flashes once then second later flashes again takes picture . none my pictures suffer red-eye anymore . flash also very powerful . 5 . it many manual settings more artistic pictures . i still haven't even gotten check out all little features this camera comes . it lot different " scene " presets also allows you manual mode ( focus exposure ) . overall , this camera met exceeded all expectations i . i would definitely recommend pentax s5i family member or friend .	1
very good accessory , protects lens , helps taking very good pictures some special situations	1
i took pictures this camera artificial light , natural light , when it almost dark all my images came out sharp . i'm only using cheap 18-55mm lens , which not image stabilization . long i use tripod , or brace against something hold camera still , images perfect . i shot landscapes , portraits , animals , moving traffic , sky , moon , everything i could think it all came out right . i going buy 5d , but so far i'm satisfied this camera price way lower . now i wonder what my pictures would like lens ... hmmmm :	1
i'm very happy this lens . it offer ample variety options , high image quality it light	1
this lens truly ' must ' if you don't lots cash spend . simply put , it excellent performer money . i recently got this lens my rebel xt , noticed huge improvement over 18-55mm kit lens . sharpness improved considerably . 18-55mm some serious issues area . first all , sharpness really bad large apertures . but smaller apertures not really much better . 28-105mm still not best performer large apertures . but it much better than 18-55mm . however , around f8 or higher , 28-105mm tack sharp . addition , this lens not suffer problem clear foreground soft background my 18-55mm suffers . color accuracy also greatly improved 28-105mm . colors look much more natural this lens than 18-55mm lens . this particularly true lighter colors , especially when you go increase saturation photoshop ( or other software ) . increasing saturation improve appearance dark colors picture taken 18-55mm would typically make lighter colored objects look very unnatural . this sort problem much reduced 28-105mm . i should also say this lens appears overexpose somewhat compared 18-55mm . this more good than bad , however , it effect making lens faster . course , this lens not without its drawbacks . i mentioned slight softness large apertures , instance . also , it not fastest lens out there . but then again , what you expect price ? finally , 28mm not exactly wide angle cropped sensor digital slr like rebels or 20d . but despite these drawbacks , this lens really performs like champ . when used its element ( ie higher f-numbers ) , it works quite well . also , since it not ef-s lens , it not become paperweight should you decide upgrade 5d .	1
i given this lens after my sigma 28-135mm lens broke . while lens fixed , i haven't used it since attatching canon lens my camera . canon 28-105mm may smaller zoom range , but other than clearly superior lens every respect . it sturdy , fast-focusing , sharp , good color . short , it what you hope find when purchasing consumer grade lens . there other cheaper lenses market , like sigma lens or canon f/4- 5.6 , but this lens worth extra $100 its reliability , sharpness overall usability	1
i originally bought brand blower clean my digital camera , but after using it once i ended up introducing more dirt and/or rubber bits than i care remember . long story short i don't use my camera anymore it took me long time get all crud out my camera . but then i decided give brand try since so many people seemed able use blower bulbs without any problems . when i got my new blower my sensor already fairly clean , but after using it it little cleaner . you still sometimes those stuck particles ( i use sterile pec pads eclipse solution get rid those pretty good results , but this your own risk since it voids most camera manufacturers warranties . ) i also keep my blower original packaging keep it clean possible , i guess i am little gun shy after my first experience	1
one problems owning digital camera you'll occasionally clean dust off image sensor . you can't use compressed air because it freeze destroy your sensor . you don't really want blow either because moisture your breath damage your sensor ... make you pass out . you need " dry " , relatively-high pressure air this what rocket air outstanding . simple use . 1-remove your lens ( slr ) , 2-put into cleaning mode , 3-hang camera upside down ( presumably , allow dust fall out ) , 4-squeeze rocket air thereby cleaning camera . this point , i swear it . i'm constantly changing lenses this helps remove spects ghost images . it must your camera kit	1
this absolute do-everything flash , master/slave operation , wireless control multiple channels slave flashes , : : lighting ratio control ( better than st-e2 mere : ratio ) , full manual or automatic operation , strobe effects selectable herz rates power , even small panel serves either widen its flash coverage 17mm or simply provide catchlight model eyes when using bounce flash . range excellent , battery life very good compounded one battery packs . light itself provides excellent color , red lamp near base adds much more accurate less harsh focus assist lamp than most canon cameras provide . if you slr , you'll almost certainly want external flash . you provide fill flash reduce shadows subjects eyes etc . during harsh daylight shots , take flash off camera eliminate nasty shadows , avoid shadows caused larger lenses onboard flashes . minor quibbles : most dslrs crop ratios 1.3 or 1.6 , but don't pass this information 550ex , which wouldn't care anyway . this means flash thinks you want greater coverage than you really need ( i.e. it give you 50mm angle flash coverage , when you only need 80mm ) , so you waste lot flash power don't get optimum recycling times . also , interface little non-intuitive . if you want slave- or onboard-only flash don't need all extra features , considerably cheaper 420ex you . said , if you want all extra features , 550ex still not you . you want 580ex , slated october 2004 release , which fixes minor issues 550	1
camera perfect solution someone who not want exchangable lensesand some items more professional results . combined direct photo printer it easy fun plenty photo options dial . my only problem i not receive camera software alllow me download computer memory chip itself . there any way get this software	1
i am very happy product , it very very good , only thing it not bring multiple pictures leaving button pressed , but image quality outstanding !	1
exz750 simply fantastic compact camera . it takes great pictures , even greater if you bother use one many picture presets ( scenery , portrait , macro , etc . ) . pros : - picture quality great ; if you want anything better you'll probably lugging around dslr- picture presets extremely easy use , even if you not techie / or you've never handled camera your life ( there such person ? ) . - it fit into your pocket you'll forget it there . this major advantage best camera camera you actually you - this one you . - common settings ( picture size , iso , etc . ) one or two clicks away - very convenientthe cons : - camera take videos ( more than decent resolution ) but they come out shaky even if you pretty steady hands . without some image stabilization it , it definitely not replacement video camera- although camera iso settings 200 400 you should probably avoid them due noiseoverall , very positive pleasing experience . even digital slr , i'm never giving this little puppy up	1
this lens my favorite i keep it my rebel xt all times . i enjoy taking macro close-ups portrai t-t ype shots , which makes this great lens everyday use . it light-weight not bulky . my last slr camera ( years ago ) minolta 50mm f/ 1.8 lens , various other lenses i rarely used . i usually don't use zoom lens due extra length weight . also , most non-professional zoom lenses much slower closest tele-position due higher f/stop . fixed focal length 60mm , i don't mind moving myself toward or away subject ( not big deal ) . pictures always appear sharp good contrast color saturation . my opinion this lens : " buy it ... you'll like it " . i ... i love it . good luck	1
if you would like list sites reviews email gumby dontquotemeonthat dot com pros : very sharp , bright ( fast ) , versatile , excellent build quality . cons : af tends dicy low-light conditions . pros : sharp , sharp , sharp . no distortion , no ca , optically superb better cons : ef-s mount . sell it when i upgraded 5d . pros : very solid build , internal focusing fantastic , produces wonderfully saturated photos high contrast , bokeh lovely very smooth , auto focus typical ring-usm full time manual focus excellent smooth . 2.8 aperture , 52mm filter size cons : i feel canon could reduce price , however this quality i don't mind paying it . if your newbie here some info lens " fast " when it low f-stop ... ok so when you smaller number apature bigger which allows more light through , so this means you up shutter speed . still enough light reach sensor . ok so lets say you out door shot if you say f/4 lens shutter speed could 1/250 second you would get good exposer . now this lens only go f/4 but if you same outdoor setting , f/ 2.8 lens you could jump 1/500 second get same exposer . freeze action mmore effectivly , this i believe why it " fast " lens . ok fun get it	1
new canon ef-s 60mm 2.8 macro usm digital slr lens designed cover entire field digital imaging sensors canon digital slr line , most notably canon eos 20d . this corresponds film normal lens perspective approximately 50mm lens . furthermore it benefits canon usm autofocusing technology , allowing photograher rapid , almost silent , autofocus , which important when working field ( you don't want distract animal you photographing sound lens focused . ) . although this lens not series lens , quality its construction comes close canon premium series professional line lenses . indeed , i read elsewhere excellent test report ( i believe erwin puts website ) this lens praising its optical performance . any canon user digital slrs such eos 20d who interested macro photography regard this lens absolutely essential making great macro images	1
works great orignal battery . you never know difference except lot cheaper !	1
i bought this battery extra battery my camera . it lot lower price than canon battery . i not used either my original or this extra battery enough fully compare them , but they seem work equally well so far	1
i purchased my 300d may 2005 , when xt released this 6.3 mp model price began falling . i'd really pick this camera apart tell you downsides it ; disregard reviews those who think this camera not up par -- course it not comparable eos 1-series or 5d , so don't expect same features or capabilities . right user , however , get similar results . said , unless you professional photographer , i cannot imagine how digital rebel could inadequate any amateur or semi-pro shooter . it speed megapixels since passed , but it still , especially now , great buy . kit lens perform you just fine , although most my shots kit lens 18mm , landscape or just wide-angle shots . flash works very well most situations , even extremely dark rooms . one guy complained his af hunted low light situations , even flash ... course , what you expect dark room ? use manual focus grow up . quality great iso 100-400 , although 800 somewhat ugly times , 1600 basically unusable , especially if you're not shooting f/ 2.8 or bigger . my main complaints : slow start-up time compared newer models ( xt , 20d , etc ) ... camera seems out breath after continuous shooting ; take 8 shots quickly you may notice camera needs process info before it shoot again . 2.5 frames/second not very fast if you're shooting any sports . overall , this camera incredibly reliable me ; it gotten me front page shots newspapers , magazine covers , calendars websites . i used it so much i blew out shutter 10 months ; canon fixed it no charge it works fine since . one minor problem : very rarely , it won't turn unless i remove battery re-insert it . i've found battery life fantastic . i use it all day , even flash , still some life end day . backup battery your bag should give you more than enough insurance day . i've printed 11x17 excellent results . some practice , it very easy navigate . menus options simple ; changing iso or aperture very easy despite what some complained . it very reliable fully-auto mode well , especially if you're shooting flash . memory card reader must when uploading images . overall : it old news world digital slrs , but right now , new or used model such good price really great value	1
i owned canon eos digital rebel 6.3 mp several weeks now love it . fantastic pictures features . i worked slr many years . figured it time " move up " digital slr glad i . this camera plenty features available , or you just set it " auto " works fine , too . though optional flash not needed most photography i wanted one far shots such . canon makes several models dedicated this camera , but i find them weak ( 220ex ) or costly . shop carefully trying find compatible flash . it needs " dedicated " digital rebels . one work af ( auto focus ) or slr ( film ) rebel may not work right . i also received conflicting information ritz camera , both on-line stores . bottom line , if you need flash , shop carefully ask all right questions . personally i held off buying one hoping more models lower price come out . camera already small pop-up flash . btw , tamron af 70-300 macro 1:2 zoom nice lens buy it , priced nicely beach camera	1
i recently moved into prosumer level digital . canon d30 proven awesome camera . there maybe better ( d60 ) , but if you serious digital , d30 one best cameras price . there slight lag shots , but if you not photographing speeding bullets express trains , time shots hardly distraction	1
this camera designed entry-level snapshot camera it very good just . it takes decent photos very easy use . other reviewers indicated , it tend chew through batteries , but i just buy aas cheap sam don't worry it . it works especially well outdoor situtions . it performs less well low light . due this limitation , it just useless webcam . even all lights room , webcam image almost totally black . flash lens less than inch apart , so this camera very prone redeye . there redeye reduction mode flash works okay , but doesn't totally fix problem . all-in-all , entry-level camera , a200 quite usable . just aware what it don't expect it more .	1
pros : excellent picture quality , great zoom , nice panoramic feature , sd card , great video sound quality picture camera , best you this money lcd rotate any angle . cons : flash not pop up automatically ; just 16mb sd card box . pd : this camera size not pocket one but size good enough shoot one hand . advice : use rechargeable batteries large sd card ( 2 or 4 gb ) cause video so good you love shooting . also , must times you need flash indoor other way you bad pics ; flash results amazed you .	1
works great point-and-shoot auto mode . camera just enough advanced features keep novice photographer happy long time . battery life great if you purchase top quality rechargables . large , least 1g sd card , should used . image stabilization works well . tripod necessary if using camera full zoom	1
though i am not qualified write quality filters , they seem doing job pretty well . finish good they fit well 58 mm canon lense my rebel xt . lense cap goes right over it so it doubly protected . small pouch hold three filters also big help keep them safe easily accessable	1
this camera lot modes you use . it very good resolution optical zoom . 12x optical zoom you click awesome pictures , specially live performances sightseeing trips . 5 mp resolution more than enough , otherwise pics become just too big fit one screenshot . you also panoramic pictures it . only two complaints - flash recycling time should lesser , sd card comes it only 16 mb , which hardly enough 7-8 pics . you buy 512 mb or 1 gb sd card separately . also , batteries come it not rechargeable , so you buy charger batteries well , which not so expensive . but these drawbacks there s3is also . overall , this camera gives very clear pictures worth buying if you happen get it decent price .	1
i viewed concert photos taken s2 number different photographers they absolutely took my breath away . saw output other cameras comparison they didn't even come close . i using canon a80 prior while i happy it , my first round photos s2 proved most impressive . while you use this point shoot , this camera you should spend some time learning so you get most it . although s3 latest version camera , i'm not sure you get much more money	1
i mainly bought this go end lens adapter s2 . it well protect lens , but you can't put lens cap over it . it ends up easier use without lens cap ... quicker when taking pictures . pictures very good through it	1
i took few identical photos without this filter , saw no difference sharpness nor contrast . so , if you're looking save damage your lense , this way go . i like able clean this filter quickly . otherwize i would spend 10-20 minutes cleaning lense so very carefull not scratch it . also , it minimize uv haze ... but i havn't compared with/without type situation . ( please comment if you different opinion ... ( brand )	1
this lens so many uses . anytime i position myself where my subject more than five feet away , this my lens choice . i kit 18-70mm came d70 50mm prime ( i 18-200 vr order , if nikon ever get around catching up demand , lens might surpass this one , due smaller weight - plus it lot cheaper ) . i took every lens i own d70 british museum london . shooting handheld available light ( i never used flash ) many egyptian greek artifacts over fifty feet away , i got outstanding results this lens . vr technology amazing . constant 2.8 aperture also major advantage . i'll grant you my arm felt like rubber hose after four hours site seeing , but it worth it ! i similar satisfaction using lens outdoors wildlife photography . i even used tc-20eii teleconverter lens , shoot hummingbirds great distance . i would no reservations recommending lens , until nikon announced 18-200 vr . this new lens much broader focal length low end , focuses much closer ( around foot , compared five feet 70-200 ) . 18-200 not provide constant 2.8 aperture across it focal length , so 70-200 would better long distances low light . but less than half price , i think less than half size , this new lens clearly premier spot my bag . it totally replace 70-200vr ? i'll update my review when i finally get try lens block . until then , 70-200mm vr champ	1
this lens only two " faults . " first , it big heavy -- quality construction often yields heavy lens . second , once photographer seen results this lens produce , there likelihood he or she unhappy other lenses camera bag . results first : images razor sharp this zoom mounted my nikon d70s . i get shots i never could get before because this lens so crisp subjects taken distance nevertheless cropped produce acceptable close-up image . subjects taken more normal distances breathtakingly sharp -- if shot excellent prime lens . this fast lens ( f/ 2.8 throughout its entire zoom range ) . almost more importantly , this lens best " bokeh " i ever experienced lens . " bokeh , " extent i understand concept ( it japanese word meaning roughly " unfocused " ) , word describing whether out-of-focus portion image ( i.e. blurred background photo which only subject focus ) pleasing look it . this lens produces wonderful , creamy bokeh . sharpness bokeh , combined excellent bright color rendition this lens , makes this one true classic . i occasionally experienced minor ghosting this lens when shooting into very bright subject , i.e. sun reflecting off ocean . this normal shortfall zoom lens comprised multitude elements , i sometimes experienced this . but such occasions rare . autofocusing action this lens very good . even birds very long distances usually produce quick , snappy autofocus lock my nikon d70s . very seldom it " hunt " af lock , these occasions likely due operator error rather than lens . this lens also features vibration reduction ( vr ) which enables it produce acceptable images below what f/ 2.8 lens would otherwise suitable . vr really works , too , although it no means panacea dim lighting . this one nikon professional lenses , quality construction excellent . critical mount metal , entire lens built like tank . lens comes nice squeeze-style lens cap , very good lens hood easily reversed storage . reader see i am extremely enamored this lens . reason , notwithstanding its bulk weight , this lens produces best nature shots i ever managed take , far .	1
i buy this uv filter protect my kit lens(18-55mm ) , so far so good . i am using canon rebel xd . if you just want get cheap uv protect your lens , buy this one	1
i get least uv filter all my lenses . that cheapest insurance you get you lense . protect it possible scratches banging against objects . haven't really seen major difference brand filter tiffen filter . i would just go cheapest filter found you lens	1
i recently purchased this camera it very easy use takes nice pictures . i bought case put it so i could keep screen getting scratched . go out find generic camera bag fit it . they so much cheaper than canon camera bags . only thing this camera i would like change i wish it battery life indicator .	1
i like canon digital camera because it everything average person may want . it light , great design , works incredibly good i make hundreds pictures . isn't dream come true ? highest recommendation	1
i nikon d50 , when attaching camera , tilting base tripod needs little compensation camera weight . hence , i haven't found any use libelle tripod . i look through wiev finder see if my set-up level or not . overall though , it not big problem , hey , price tripod , i'll live it	1
this stuff worth your small money , useful your precious cameras	1
lens pens don't perfect job , but they better job than anything thing else i found . it " must " product anyone camera ! nikon lens pen worked well me	1
i bought this pen my boyfriend his new canon digital rebel slr , but you could use it almost anything lens . it got small brush one end swipe away big stuff , round felt tip other cleaning smudges . he finds it very useful it fits right hiw camera bag	1
i'm surprised see lot people only give 1 * this camera ! i've it 2 years now i just love it ! thanks it , i discovered i real passion photography ... it very easy use my pictures great ! when i show them , people usually tell me " you must expensive camera " ... i just show them my little canon s500 they surprised result!i'm just loving it	1
i needed replace lost s4oo we year . looked sd series thought them too small comfort . there such thing too thin handle comfortably . s500 , like s400 , just right size . big area back thumb so you even one-hand hold it . try any sd . pictures excellent hand-held . not nikon n70 film slr good , but plenty good enough any snapshot purpose . bought one last new s500 available newegg abd very , very happy it	1
this flash preforms excellence ! all nikon products i pro grade . this flash recycles fast ready when i need extra light fill main light . i purchased sb-600 d-200 am very happy it . i used it last six weddings this year shooting action shots skate boarding compitions . . wolf , atl . ga	1
i've quite satisfied my nikon d50 i've using built-in flash occasionally get evenly lit images balanced exposed shots . but built-in flash just doesn't cut it . i made huge mistake taking pics my cousin wedding reception huge hall thinking tripod , high iso settings , built-in flash suffice . i wrong . i borrowed fellow photographer spare speedlight ( sb-600 ) when i downloaded pics my computer some fine tuning , i noticed huge difference built-in flash . speedlight gave me more area covered flash . roughly under $200+ , this quite bargain . i'd recommend rechargeable aa batteries . recycle time flash fast .	1
i bought this flash use my nikon d200 it works better than i hoped . you fine tune it your own personal liking it more options than i am currently smart enough use . but don't worry , you don't super camera geek get great results right off bat . this thing great " reach " it actually zooms right your lens pinpoint your subject . it just audible enough let you know it doing . i'm definitely glad i bought this thing . much better than small pop-up flash	1
very solid camera , but bit heavy . good battery life . it very professional camera	1
i developed dimple my right retina places blur center my field view . i am right handed so my right eye my " sighting eye " . this device gives me clearance use my left eye focus compose my shots . i love it	1
i've my d70s year now , haven't regretted it second . controls laid out logically , everything hand . dual control wheels make adjustments fast accurate . i personally love optional grid overlay , i no excuses horizons aren't horizontal . wireless flash system great , though you buy sb-600 or sb-800 get full benefit . this camera bigger heavier than d50 d80 , which my opinion positive thing .	1
excellent camera kit . versatile . i lot learn camera , though , it no simple point-and-shoot . however , auto mode , it takes great point-and-shoot pictures . i look forward learning how use it fully . lenses came warranty cards , but camera itself not . i bought sb-600 flash well battery two 1 gb compact flash cards round out kit . camera lens attached large , which i underestimated . $80 camera bag too small it all . great camera , though . price best i could find anywhere	1
i'm looking closeup lens my canon eos rebel xt . but before buying i wish i see some pictures taken using this lens	1
i got this lens because i didn't really own anything close this range except kit lens ( good but not great not f/ 2.8 ) . i own 15mm canon fisheye but it distort quite bit even 20d i don't like correct photoshop each time i wanted wide lens . i wanted something wider , could capture lots light ( i allot ambient low light photowork ) i wanted something versatile ( 20d this really 24mm 56mm --- great working range ) . pros : 1 ) 1.6 crop factor my 20d this really 24 56mm lens . this makes it quite bit less wide angle more midrange lens . consequently , it stays my camera all time covers most my daily needs . i bought this lens fully expecting it 24 56 i wanted it multi purpose 24mm its still pretty wide . 2 ) i try avoid flash much possible given type photography i f/ 2.8 i take some great ambient light pictures i would not able otherwise3 ) f/ 2.8 , i also blow backgrounds foregrounds out focus . out focus areas gorgeously buttery blokeh very nice given 7 blades shutter . 4 ) color saturation like nothing i've ever seen before except my 70-200mm canon " " . i literally floored some baby pictures i took where colors two words " mind blowing " . i knew color would great but " wow ! " photoshop cs2 i " fake " saturation but its just not quite same color came out this lens straight out box . zero photoshop touchup needed . 5 ) its sharp ! this lens takes some amazingly sharp pictures into what i would classify amazing . i've received numerous positive comments sharpness this lens . i've tried looking edges see if there any ca or less sharpness couldn't really find any . maybe full size sensor you tell more but i couldn't really 20d . i notice plane focus f/ 2.8 narrow ( which good ) i make sure everything i want focus . blokeh very buttery f/ 2.8 . i like it quite bit . 6 ) its built like tank . black metal shell . metal ef mount . smooth manual focusing . sturdy recessed switches . red stripe catches eye photographers who know .... easy strike up conversations learn . 7 ) it surprisingly smaller lighter than i thought it would . half size my 70-200mm canon " " . i expecting it bigger am much happier it wasn't . its my camera all time not chore carry around all . unless you're very petite person . 8 ) internal focusing . so lens size doesn't change size or turn when focusing . this very useful when you put filters or when you're focusing close . 9 ) usm motor . its whisper quiet it focuses super fast . faster than my 70-200mm .... something i'd expect but wow its fast silent . 10 ) it focuses pretty close 12 inches or so . you get close your subject . its not macro lens but you get some dramatic wide angle shots its close focusing . 11 ) its ttl2 so works very nice my 580ex flash . 12 ) ef mount grow you . if you upgrade your camera body full frame camera ef mount , this lens fit your new camera you continue enjoy your lens investment . cons : 1 ) 1.6 frame size , it doesn't get into " amazing " wide category but that not fault lens . i'm marking this down con but you take it several ways . if you want get ultra-wide small frame camera , you won't this lens ( although 24mm pretty darn wide ) your only canon options 15mm fisheye which i own think great specialty lens , 10-22mm efs canon , 14mm . 10-22 i hear very good but its efs ( won't fit full frame cameras - less upgradable i think ) its not lens although non-l 10-22 i hear exceptional . 14mm ef run you almost much this 16-35mm zoom . 15mm ef fisheye wonderful but it designed distort distortion visible 20d even more so full frame cameras you need photoshop fix . this 16-35mm , if you want f/ 2.8 ok something like 24-56 , then you won't find better small-sensor cameras . i'm very glad i got it , if you already full frame camera or upgrade some point , you enjoy 16mm " wow " wide . i only imagine coverage i'd get full frame camera . 2 ) hood massive ... wide but not very deep ... so its shallow hood ( it wide angle i guess ) . i never take it off -- it keeps stray light out secondary protection lens . i zero problems lens flare . 3 ) front lens element sink out inside tube ( exposed but lens case doesn't change size ) . there no protective filter protect front element . i bought uv/haze filter ($26 amazon ) i highly recommend you well protect your investment . uv/haze filter , lens very self contained . 4 ) oh cost .... my oh my . expensive heck . cost much my camera body --- worth every penny . if its any consolation , these lenses very hard make they keep their value . your camera body might drop value new technology arrives but this lens hold its value if you take care it . differences , notes , things i've heard : 1 ) i no experience non canon lenses so i can't compare but this 16-35 amazing . 2 ) compared other " " lenses , it holds up quality amazing when it comes color , performance , lens construction . 3 ) i hear there some chromatic aberation edges these wide lenses ( well more than 70-200mm ) but that expected when you're gathering light such wide angles focusing it .... that got hard . wide angles exhibit more ca than long telephotos . my 16-35mm it wasn't visible me . i imagine pro pro might notice care . anybody less stringent requirements than pro pro or extremely saavy person , couldn't even notice or care . besides , ca this lens orders magnitude less than almost any other lens . 4 ) i bought directly amazon . ordered monday got lens next day tuesday . amazing service . great store .	1
we dedicated thumb drive use digital photo frame we download our digital pictures computer . then we simply plug thumb drive into usb port digital photo frame follow menu instructions select usb port thumb drive pushing couple buttons digital photo frame . slide show pictures we view approximately ten feet away very good resolution . it great family gatherings received many positive comments our guests .	1
great idea poorly executed . construction cheap . screen marginal best . but worst all , it refuses recognize any 3 digital cameras i hand or usb card reader . piece junk i am now returnin	-1
i purchased 8 10 photo frame way display photos my wedding reception planned use it my home thereafter . i able get product running load ' test ' set pictures , but product then ' froze ' startup screen . i checked pacific digital support website , which provided steps ( basically , sequence buttons hold down ) ' unfreeze ' reinitialize unit . i tried this sequence several times , no avail , then called pacific digital customer service . after repeated messages left voice mail system ( " we're sorry we missed your call - we'll get back you " ) all times day night , i unable contact anyone company no calls ever returned . long story short - our wedding came went , problem never ( apparently never ) resolved , digital photo frame now $390 paperweight . absolutely useless . my recommendation : not purchase pacific digital product . this clearly fly-by-night outfit	-1
i 2 rebel cameras so it just made sense me pick up this digital camera attach my old lenses . while i owned other digitals i keep going back my old rebel , until now . we got back up battery pack . my husband i love it	1
if you swim ocean , lake , or just like around water want take pictures , this thing , it worth every penny !! only thing you can't when it case upload pictures your computer , change out memory cards charge battery . it truly amazing . i've my eye this very long time cruise coming up i knew i get it . i'm snorkeling enthusist this definatly thing . instead those silly disposable cameras limit you only 27 pictures , you haven't got clue exactly what you've taken picture , you take many your memory card allow you . there also filter flash you slide into place help dispurse light get ideal picture underwater !	1
lens hood performs it should limiting stray light but it little sloppy comes off easily if bumped . it easy attach reverses quickly easy storage . pretty much no brainer but money i'd like little better fit	1
nice hood . it designed canon ef-s 17-85mm lens therefore what it supposed .	1
i bought this camera my wife christmas 04 ' i thought i ordered it too late it arrive time christmas , but these people great ! they got it me time we love this camera we use it all time - we several accs . item it quality picture wonderful . thanks mark christian	1
item exactly described . works perfectly helped make some great shots yosemite	1
it what it says it'll , while it pricey couple contact switches plastic handle , considering cost parts my time make something similar , it bargain . i would liked more heavy duty construction , contacts more definite tactile feedback focus vs shoot position , but it works just fine , it lets me take pictures while talking more easily subject , addition obvious vibration reduction	1
i bought this lens i walking out africa month half safari . i didn't own true wide angle lens i just spent most my budget 70-200mm usm " " lens 1.4 extension . i wanted get widest lens i could get but i didn't big bucks get 16-35l or 14mm so i got this lens figuring i could correct photoshop cs2 later . this what i found : 1 ) i 20d it doesn't barrel distort anywhere near bad i thought it would .... i imagine it distorts quite bit more 5d or other full frame sensor but 20d , 10d , 30d , or rebel it not bad . 2 ) it distort enough even 20d its noticable every single inside shot many panoramic shots .... experienced professional , you'd notice it even panoramas . 3 ) computer person : i find it very easy correct barrel distortion photoshop cs2 very easily .... i use plugin ( there several web)4 ) i tend like barrel distortion look some my pictures . pros1 ) image quality superb . not lens , this lens some amazing color , sharpness , saturation . they spared very little grinding this lens . some my best african pictures , daytime nightime taken this lens they fabulous . 2 ) build pretty well , metal mount , metal integrated hood ... but not up standards any means .... its credit , it survived 14 days vibration ridden truck treking across kalahari desert all its dust , mokoro canoeing okavango delta over week , hiking , elephant riding , five diamond resort victoria falls ( last one easy fisheye ) ... 3 ) it fisheye lens if used properly , it create some amazing pictures views ... example botswana okavango , i knelt down next gigantic baobab tree pointed it up towards sky , fisheye captured not only rex guide standing next tree but entire massive trunk baobab all canopy tree way above . everything ! i know few lenses would let me . it amazing shot only possible fisheye . 4 ) it focuses 12inches . 5 ) f/ 2.8 makes it very good low light situation . 6 ) integrated hood comes complete nice metal cover . cons1 ) its not built like : ) no usm motor so you hear whir it tries focus ) no moisture seals etc ) it metal mount2 ) it fisheye lens -- i found out after month half what this meant .... it doesn't stay my camera much . i take it out when i need certain effect or when i plan retouch photoshop . it distorts visibly 20d i imagine quite bit more full frame . 3 ) integrated hood ... can't put screw filters ... but it gel filter holder . 4 ) no bag . my veredict : 1 ) i've purchased 16-35mm canon " " lens stays camera most time when i want wide-angle but when i need special look or i really want capture everything , i bring out my 15mm fisheye . i won't sell it , i don't regret buying it . i learned what specialty fisheye lens its staying my arsenal those special shots . 2 ) i can't compare against non-canon lenses but i say canon quality here extraordinary . i would knock them construction but lens built well enough " glass " itself spectacular so 5 stars . 3 ) i ordered amazon 3 days before my trip --- it arrived next day . great service . thx amazon .	1
first , let me cover most important point : it work ? yes . praise most users express this item well merited . i purchased this because , like everyone else , normal batteries just not last . ten or fifteen photos , especially if you used flash , they'd ready change ; even so-called " heavy duty " or those marketed " digital camera " didn't make difference . well , both those terms should reserved these power cells ; they really less like battery more like power pack . my first charge up , which took only 3 hours 6 minutes - i timed it - i wanted actually test how many photos one could get . my smaller camera , 3mp fujifilm finepix s3100 , i got 52 photos , some flash , most without . not random snaps see how many it could record , but actually taking time frame them , select composition , etc . camera stayed entire time using full lcd rather than viewfinder , took all photos highest-resolution setting , transferred auto , manual , situational modes , charged full flash 8 times , went into preview mode . three hours , 47 minutes later , i got " low battery " warning - not depleted - low . i stopped then , sure i not overpaid . ** note : these power cells likely last much longer than 3h47m . lower resolution may result more photos . these numbers simply represent unscientific but strenuous personal test see what product would o.o ther notes product : - all parts except door made hard , impact resistant plastic . - fold away plug back makes charger easier store . - red green leds very bright , no mistake charge full mode . - two " channels " , . seems charge sets batteries best ; this may issue reviewer who reported issues using one battery time . - black ( body back ) , silver ( body front ) blue ( door ) looks nice . i one complaint , though perhaps it only one founded pure puzzlement . door flips open ... right . when holding unit your hand , monster logo top led bottom , door flips open right . my guess this decision made so door didn't close your hand when loading , because most people tilt it their left hand so it facing away them 45 degrees ; i know i . my final review : 5 out 5	1
after reading reviews , just bought charger . first charge took 3 hours , then led turned green . i accidentally disconnected power , when i plug it again , led turns orange , start charging again . this hurt battery	1
i bought one these my canon sd-800 recommend it . many years now , i've carried canon pocket cameras my belt while traveling canon-branded cases simply best this purpose . my only criticism canon cases their lack small pocket media . i hoping tiny size sd cards canon would added such pocket their newer cases , but they haven't . plus side , case retains superior leather construction , uses neat magnetic tie down flap instead velcro or snap , belt loop tight enough hold camera comfortably against your body . package also includes nice looking leather replacement strap your camera . incidentally , sd-800 well matched case , fitting quite securely	1
i'm owner canon sd630 . this case fit very good my camera it very good kind leather	1
i originally bought case walmart but it just wasnt working out . what difference this one made . fits like glove well worth few extra dollars this one cost comparison ill fitting one . i highly recomend this your canon sd630plus service delivery excellent	1
just what i needed out spend fortune glass filter protect my expensive nikon lenses . i bought one each my different lenses because i would rather break filter than glass lens	1
filter decent . i paid only $3 free shipping so im not expecting much out this filter . i bought it protection it perfectly . not best night shots obviously but overall good buy	1
i bought this camera based several online reviews , including steve digicams , couldn't more pleased . i've using it since last christmas ( bought it present myself after six months looking various brands models ) . aside image quality ( which it plenty ) i insisted least lcd viewfinder ( evf ) well screen , real filter ring ( no adapters , please ! ) easy basic controls , long optical zoom , cf card , hot shoe ability use ordinary aa batteries pinch . also fit my hand feel natural . this all , plus actual cable release socket shutter button ! ( thus i easily use my cable bulb releases , well long-duration timer i my 35mm kit . ) it also standard pc socket more flash options than built flash or hot shoe . heft good , but not very heavy . you carry it long time without fatigue , but it enough mass steady your hand , enough size easy gripping . i find it very instinctive point shoot it . most basic control locations convenient easily remembered . ( zoom manual only , but suits me . i don't like waiting motorized zooms get where i want , especially zoom range this long . ) i'll leave it pro reviewers discuss image merits , but i say me they seem perfectly sharp very good color even default settings . addition , i've gotten very good results shooting night very long exposures . ( starry sky , clouds backlit moon , streets under moonlight streetlamps , etc . ) much less noise " grain " than i've experienced other cameras . so far it closest film i've found such situations - any price i afford , leas t.t he electronic viewfinder ( evf ) bright sharp performs well low light . i don't miss optical viewfinder much all . there diopter adjustment accomodate most people visiion . ( stops just short enough my worst eye - comes closer than most , though - but i find i use efv my glasses if i want ) . one accessory i strongly recommend soft rubber , wide angle , lens shade ( 58mm filter ring ) . they found cheap ( i paid $7 local store ) protect rim lens when you set down camera addition shading lens . there included hard-plastic lens shade clips outside lens rim , but t " notched " i worry catching it things - i like soft rubber ones better ( they look more " pro " too ) . it may interfere supplemental illumination lamp focussing , so you'll want remove it when shooting close mid-range photos dim light	1
( wife account holder)i knew before i bought this camera it just what i needed ! i am semi-pro-am photography hobby job . i knew i didn't need $5k camera we work , but wanted something more than my $200 point shoot . this it ! out box , it took 15 min take my first pic . hardest part threading camera strap lens cap holder - nice little detail . main selling point me " natural light " mode . tried flash without mode quality amazing . my little ps didn't any good low light without flash , this camera gets a+ . few minor notes i wanted make before i lovestruck : lcd screen no protection , just kind out there open . cover or even just little plastic stick-on most low end cameras come would enough make me feel like it isn't going bust . viewfinder really just mini-lcd screen , which i imagine bit number batteries , though not much full size lcd back . menu looks pretty extensive , but fairly easy navigate once it becomes little more familiar . so far , i love it , but took off one star because lcd issue . maybe i find cover or something it help me feel better it . other than , i already tell this camera everything i need take great pics get creative some manual settings exposure manipulation . love it takes xd cf cards - both camera same time ! save movies one , pics other ! it feels pretty solid , takes super inexpensive aa batteries - selling point me , hot shoe sync capabilities . if you looking go slr , but can't fork out dough , this perfect alternative . ( though check around price - [ ... ] rebate , i got mine less than [ ... ] !!	1
i am pleased this camera . its pretty easy use . i virtually no camera experience , save breaking them . this camera easy operate pretty fun fool around . i used aperture setting several times get different focus points pics . instructions easy comprehend . i taken quite bit sports photos i noticed its extremely difficult get shots inside gymnasium . shots usually very blurry color just isn't right most time . fluorescent modes camera helpful , but not fix problem . it could just me though	1
i'm using it few months now ; i haven't found single problem so far . earlier , i using old finepix optic/sensor sensitivity not very good ; poor quality photos taken dark environment . this not problem any more . also , i impressed sharpness photos sport actions taken 10x zoom . general , i pretty enthusiastic all features this camera ; it took me nearly 3 days try everything out :-) . sure , there better cameras market ; however , considering price it just great deal	1
quality definitely great . when attached s3 , it makes your camera look serious taking good shots . if you attaching hood doing flash photography , i suggest you use slave flash eliminate shadow caused hood	1
i bought this camera because small size , megapixles zoom + digital zoom . i wanted something take outdoors into wilderness not worry hurting it . price wise i feel this camera offers pleanty featrues very reasonable price	1
this excellent pocket camera it lives up nikon reputation quality . while it lacks some controls seen more sophisticated models pictures please most demanding this class camera . i liked it so well i bought two , one myself one gift budding photographer	1
this camera worth every penny . i just recieved it today so far i like it lot . seems well made , nice size lcd screen , takes good pictures what i seen so far . battery life seems good . it 15 scene modes which you would not expect camera it price range . macro mode excellent ! only downsides really time it takes when you take picture time you take next , it takes second flash charge . camera only comes 10mb internal memory , so unless you going invest bigger memory card , you only able take 6 pictures . video mode good , but not any sound . overall i give it 4.5 . price paid : $11	1
using either ef 16-35mm lenses or ef-s 10-22mm lenses ( 20d or rebel bodies 1.6 crop factor ) this hood helps eliminate ( i mean reduce lot ) flare sunny days or certain lightning conditions ..... highly recommended those who like shot lower end ( 16mm ) these lenses .	1
nikon d50 absolutely fantastic camera . if you moving point shoot , you jump completely new leage photography . pros : 1 . noise extremely low iso 800 , highly usable 1600.2 . camera control good , you get 2.5 frame per second , more than enough non-professionals . 3 . flash sync 1/500 sec , one best market . 4 . image quality ( iq ) excellent . cons : 1 . lcd screen small . 2 . top lcd no back light . 3 . no depth field review button . regards , csoura	1
i am very happy this camera . it takes very good photos automatic mode , but all extra features make you want learn how take amazing photos . also , i big hands so camera feels lot nicer my hands than canon digital rebel xt . only improvements i would make camera : 1 - i am big guy so strap doesn't seem quite long enough . eventually i'll pick up new one . 2 - battery charger setup very bulky . i'm not quite sure why they chose put 5 foot electric cable onto charger instead making it plug directly into outlet . 3 - after used canon camera software , nikon preview mode zoom feature seems cumbersome . otherwise this camera great . i'm looking forward learning more picking up lense	1
i've a510 six months pleasantly surprised ease use reasonable picture quality 3.2 camera . after six months lens cover jammed i noticed many amazon reviewers same issue . one evening i took several pictures next morning camera would not operate . i'm hoping service center provide me better service than some reviewers .	1
i am am very happy this package . only issue , thick stainless steel neck strap . i no use it i never seen anyone using it . i would prefer extra battery or existing battery extended life one . overall , price you cannot get leather case battery combo somewhere else same price amazon . i consider neck strap unnecessary component one comes camera lighter more flexible . it also more elegant .	1
i rated accessory kit 3 well . gave kit 3 3 star . i gave kit 2 my mom who just got sd550 . great camera what i tell . this kit however needs major improvements . going best kit 2 , worst it , we starting review battery pack . battery ... uhhh , not much say here . spare battery use hot spare out there if your running low after taking too many shots . mine kit 3 great i still use it this day . i swap active battery each time i charge . this what gave this product many stars i given it . final decision ( battery ): wonderfulneck strap ... ( taken kit 3 added improvements)if your moving around this thing way long or way short . it too short strap across you chest . it way long because if it hangs front you , your precious camera you just paid couple few hundred now freely bouncing around . not good . my mom really short this just too short her use well . not much bouncing issue me but still not useful enough her . her comment , " this strap either too short or too long . doesn't fit me all . " cracks me up because i never told her my personal opinion matter she came up same results . final decision ( neck strap ): use it jump drive you use often or anything else . just not your precious camera . case ... they screwed up kit 3 , this kit still screwed up ( managed even worse than kit 3 ) . velcro fine most usage so i can't knock . belt clip fine dandy . case pretty darn good keeping camera safe outside elements harm . hole center useless heck just like kit 3 ( mom came same conclusion ) . here where they really screwed up . stitching this case worse than kit 3 . kit 3 , you only worry stitching screwing up your screen back case . this case , you stiching back front . unlike kit 3 which magnetic clasp where stitching or any attachment case hidden behind soft cloth , this one velcro stitching inside front . belt clasp stiching other side . no escape this kit . i highly advise you get screen protector if using this case . poor design shame people who manufacture this case . final decision ( case ): " move people ... nothing see here . " seriously ... don't bother using this case without screen protector . complete decision : i wouldn't buy this kit again all . it great there extra battery but i don't think anything else worth penny more this kit . better off buying everything seprate . going lower my rating 2 stars	1
i tried this product out local camera store before i sold idea . two main things i concerned how it attach it add too much weight camera . attaching camera little concerning , i worried it may damage camera . but , after watching guy our local camera shop put one rebel i sold . basically you remove door battery compartment . which comes off lot easier than i anticipated . grip slides like battery you screw it bottom camera . don't worry their hole bottom grip tripod . grip add weight but its not significant i noticed it adds lot stability while holding it . since grip adds height camera its easier hold camera one hand . much like holding one more expensive models . it also adds battery life since grip holds two batteries . if you hold new grip take pictures camera its side . you pleasantly surprised see duplicate set buttons scroll wheel added new grip just purpose . it now permanent attachment i am glad i decided buy it . buttons work just well camera even 3fps . note quality canon grip much better than cheaper version .	1
i've used battery grip almost every canon camera i've owned since 1980 . this rebal xt battery life seems almost forever battery grip , gets doubled . grip also allows you use regular batteries so you could use them should rechargables ever die you need keep shooting . it adds shutter release button turning camera 90 degrees . larger hands would probably find camera more comfortable more grip area . it adds more mass which pro ( little more stability ) or con ( heavier carry around ) . it would nice if canon could slightly remolded it stand camera up . it , camera lean forward it lense . bottom line : i'm glad i purchased but think it could much cheaper . when you consider ( way back when ) these types devices added motor winder ( standard modern film slrs not used digital cameras ) added battery capacity . all this adds additonal battery capacity . price reason 4 stars instead 5 . course most businesses don't care long people buying . mark	1
if you're serious photography , get this accessory . second battery , i get plenty juice any event ( even my zoom lens using image stabilization ) . gives solid grip taking vertical ( portrait ) pictures while still access controls you need . i can't imagine without it now ( spite additional weight ) .	1
i am so pleased this camera ! there really nothing negative i think say it ! i also own cannon xt . i use both wedding photography well family portraits i am so impressed color quality d30 ! well cannon	1
those who truly know digital cameras , more than perhaps 8 megapixels important only if you plan blowing your images up " poster size " , or if you pro who knows how use all those pixels . truthfully , how many you really plan type stuff ? say rebel xti better than 30d because it " more megapixels " " smaller " not best advice . any canon dslr going give you great images , if know how use it . those you who trying decide which camera buy , you really need go camera store ask handle each camera . while you're it , ask yourself how it feels your hands . it too bulky ? it too small hard handle ? it features you want such spot metering , which rebel xti not ? 30d terrific dslr . it all features 99% us need . there reason why it costs more than rebel . 30d better camera overall .	1
this lens wonderful starter lens . professional might want little upgrade , but this just right someone starting out .	1
i d200 while all hype around 18-200 others , this one awesome lens portraits other closer up type photos . i read few things i research thought i'd pass my experience : - how this d200 ? ( ans : great . fast auto-focus . no compatibility issues)- you really get crisp photos cool bokeh ? ( ans : absolutely)- 1.8 ok or you need 1.4 ? ( ans : i don't 1.4 but 1.8 so competent price i get crispness shallow dof i looking for)- shooting distance 85mm acceptable or you need 55mm so you closer subject ? ( ans : i really like shooting distance 85mm . i really would not less distance me subject)enjoy	1
this original equipment battery charger manufactered canon . performance charger excellent most canon products . price paid comparible non-sale priced items puchased via internet sites . item recieved original packaging , 3 days after placing order , new ( not reconditioned new appearance ) . i am extremely pleased entire purchase process experienced , information given site ease ordering fast shipping	1
i really like this lens but my results not consistent . i think though this more function my limited skill photography . focal range seems very narrow but when you hit it results outstanding . i occasionally get images out focus but again i think this my fault . i bought this macro work but i use it prime lens most time	1
i never thought $250 lens could so good . i trying buy lenses light-weight my 20d , due neck injury problem , this 50mm fits bill . great low light , agree also , bokeh sweet . i alot bee chasing manage some great macros bees flight this one . all hand held . also take great indoor shots without flash , steady hand . i chose it also because it one least expensive high rated canon 50mm . it goes well inexpensive canon lens , 55-200mm ef 4.5 - 5.6 ii , which also well outdoors , including macro . i am very pleased both , wouldn't part them	1
i picked up canon 350d while i italy . i thinking upgrade camera canon didn't built flash . this flash great , i've only used it few times , but i am more than impressed it functionality . title , i only said " oops " because i think it more flash than i really need , least this camera . overall , i am more than impressed this flash	1
i hesitated year upgrade 550 580 because , paper , i not see much advantage . fact , 580 worthwhile upgrade . i like new dial back adjusting exposure compensation , etc . catchlight screen nice touch but biggest advantages incredibly fast recycling time smailler size . i machine gun my 1ds2 this flash keeps up . 550 could not . it small enough not overwhelm my little rebel too . i note there some vignetting 24mm direct flash unless i drop wide lens screen . manual says ths not happen but it . not big deal since i use gary fong diffuser or bounce flash almost always	1
i'm very happy my speedlite 580ex , new dimension my photographic hobb	1
i bought this camera february , it really great job so many different situations . unfortunately , i lost it this past september kicking myself ever since . i purchasing exact same camera again . excellent features include : easy usesmallgood quality ( long they aren't extremely close ) picturesi like software came cameragood accessories , esp . camera caseclear lcd screengreat options picture takinggood features include : fast shutter speed , although not quite fast enough . i'd like take more pictures faster repetition but cannot this camerai recommended this camera my best friend who lighting designer retail spaces ( dolce gabbana , instance ) he gives it excellent review well , so i know it good all types light professional purposes	1
i like picture quality features this camera this price point so much , its third one i've purchased . my family seems hard cameras such this model only seems last year or so . point its banged around my wifes purse or accidentally dropped kids telescoping mechanism lens stops working . doing web research it seems common problem . so if you're typically more gentle than me my family seem , this great easy picture taker	1
this my lens handheld images birds flight . it sharp exhibits no color fringing or other chromatic aberration . comparison , my leitz 400mm f/ 6.8 telyt shows fair amount color fringing outside center region . fair , telyt much simpler design . telyt higher contrast than ef 400mm f/4 , but levels layer photoshop fix . 400mm f/4 much lighter than any 400mm f/4 lens conventional optics . lenses diffraction element compensates color dispersion spherical lens elements . it also reduces optical complexity size . f/4 speed makes autofocus faster , allows even better isolation subjects using narrow depth field . while bigger heavier than canon 400mm f/ 5.6 , f/4 lens light enough 4.3 pounds it still easy carry . i've used mine hikes above 10,000 feet photograph bighorn sheep . definitely makes difference handheld , tripod below 1/125 second . canon 400mm f/ 5.6 non-stabilized lens . i've taken some my sharpest wildlife images this lens - you see every feather some bird shots . highly recommended if you afford one .	1
my kit includes canon d60 dslr , tamron 28-75mm f/ 2.8 , canon ef 100mm f/ 2.8 macro usm , sigma 100-300mm f/4 , 420 ex speedlite flash , 4 assorted filters , aaa batteries , 2 extra batteries d60 tripod collar . first few times i tried fit everything , my sigma 100-300 not find space . i return this bag , but tonight , decided give it try ( 10th attempt ) . surprise , surprise ... best configuration just came me all sudden . sigma lens bottom , stretched out occupy width bag , 100mm flash fits perfectly remaining part bag bottom . then , divider top , prevent scratching , place d60 tamron lens attached top , height bag makes it easily possible fit everything , close hood , without stretching bag all . my 4 filters ( jn their think cases go into front pouch . generous side-pockets fit my tripod collar 100-300 , 2 spare batteries , new box 12 aaa batteries .... this means my entire kit fits perfectly , without bag stretched uncomfortably . i'm glad i gave it this one try	1
i enjoy i get closer shot now . its quality good . i am happy purchas	1
it easy attach -- detach -- works well most ( but not all ) my 58mm lens . it cut down glare , let face it , hood makes your lens look bit more dynamic , while also protecting it elements	1
i bought this hood after reading elsewhere it fits 50mm f/ 1.8 mark i ( version metal mount distance scale ) i purchased recently . canon specs discontinued es-65 hood this lens . great thing this et-65iii it longer , so it blocks more stray light without vignetting full-frame or 1/6-frame slrs . interior this mark iii version also flocked , providing bit more light absorption . i've used those collapsible rubber hoods before while college , but this hood definitely worth investment : well built , fits backward lens storage ( but too long while lens camera ) , provides good protection front lens ( it quite deep ) . note this not fit newer 50mm f/ 1.8 mark ii version ( all plastic mount no distance scale )	1
kodak ph160 media cartridge kit best bargain around ! you get 4 cartridges plus paper each pack . i used more paper than ink ! thank you kodak such money saving kit	1
i purchased this camera year ago ( summer 05 ) . definitely great upgrade over original rebel , although new xti larger screen which one aspect this camera not perfect . there other sites perform more comprehensive reviews this camera , but after year mine still working perfectly	1
it extremely easy use . hard figure out menu , but once there no problem . takes beautiful pictures . great action shots well . seldom find blurry photo it stabelizer built	1
it not best looking remote you'll ever find but design made practical fit strap . you'll never lose this remote it works like charm	1
good remote . finnicky times if not lined up correctly camera	1
i am lifelong photographer i purchased this camera january . i taken it several major trips . it wonderful performer . i many 11x14 enlargements i received terrific feedback . quality this camera cannon optics not disappoint . price right now replacement out .	1
impressive feature list wih affordable price , serious ameteur . i've using 20d 18-55 , 50mm 1.8 , 35-80 , 80-200 500/1000mm lenses . i am not disappointed . i am planning upgrade series lenses but slowly . i not mean over entusiastic canon , but i am yet see nikon camera same specs same or ever near equal price . i've got fm10 film photography . i love both my cameras . impressive features include : mirror lockupiso 3200 noise reduction18 custom functionsaccepts entire series canon lens . heavy metal body ( no cheap plastic feel	1
i bought this camera 2 months before my son born . i knew little digital slrs , but after research i found this one me . this camera well constructed durable . pictures excellent . i blown few my pictures up 11x17 without any problem . also , if you going doing any editing photos your computer , this camera would great . i would recommend purchasing newest version photoshop or photoshop elements ( when i bought mine it only came elements 2.0 3.0 already market ) . also , if you want your pictures turn out , you must purchase larger flash . onboard flash weak , leave shadows it not allow you any type " bounce " flash . whole , this best camera i ever my life it would great anyone who previous experience slr cameras .	1
owned distortion-prone nikkor afs 17-35 2.8 six years , it time switch over canon ef 17-40 mm f4l usm . canon version over $1000 cheaper , optically superior lighter weight . me , outstanding standard lens when coupled canon 5d . vignetting f4 minimal . adobe photoshop cs2 vignetting tool correct vignetting . distortion 17mm minimal . less than canon ef 16-35 mm 2.8 usm set 16 mm . 5d pointed blue sky , ef 17-40 hunted focus point while ef 16-35 didn't . flaring minimal when compared ef 16-35 . portraits taken 40 mm produced better results than ef 16-35 afs 17-35 35 mm . images produced f4 sharp . f8 , images very sharp . this lens definite keeper .	1
i purchased this speedlight my d70s . it easy take out box fire up . but it capable lot more than your standard portraiture vacation shots . i using this unit in-store photography it worked wonders . included filters help balance out horrific fluorescent lighting found most stores . while it highly intuitive , i also control it outpu t.t his essential part any nikon package	1
here my point . when you buy digital slr , most likely couple years there newer model available some better features same price . but lenses well flashes not changing fast keep value much longer . so purely financial prospective , it always better invest more long lasting lenses flashes less dslr body . point . most people don't need all advanced feature modern flashes probably easily survive without them . but also almost everyone sooner or later finds him/herself situation , when place just too dark too big . so it more likely you'll need just more raw power then any advanced features . so bottom line , since general purpose flash usually long term investment , if you choice , try get most powerful one	1
just bought my first slr ( d50 ) my first external flash ( sb-800 af ) . i didn't know what expect , but i amazed ! i could take flash into very dark ( mostly candle lit ) large ( 40'x65 ' ) room take shot looked like daylight . far speed , its amazing - i shoot off 12 shots continuous mode my camera flash keep up ( sometimes it miss shot or two - still trying figure one out ) . so far , i couldn't more pleased	1
i bought this flash hoping improve my indoor pictures my rebel xt . amazingly , i find absolutely no difference using built flash camera or this unit . i find pictures taken very reasonable distance ( 8-10 feet ) under-exposed unless i correct exposure using menu . would curious if more expensive units including 430ex better , but i cannot recommend this one	1
first off , this lens works wonderfully canon 20d , 30d 5d . image stabilization gives photographer serious edge . my experience , when active , i'm able shoot much lower speed , without any blurring . throughout range lens , image sharpness excellent , although little soft when you zoom near 300 . otherwise , 75 280 aprox . image quality astonishing . i shot weddings , sport events , low-light conditions very cold climate conditions lens performed flawlessly . ability focussing manually plus . automatic focus always accurate . just few times more than 3000 shots lens slowed bit when focusing , but i must say objets moving . weight lens ok , not too heavy , construction seems according canon standards . when shooting particular situations , silent usm mechanism really welcome feature . overall , very nice lens serious amateur photographer	1
this lens gotten some bad reviews , i think , partly because it starting show it age . this first usm lens , technology really grown since then . if canon come updated 75-300 usm lens , man , it would blow everything away . said , yes , this lens little slow focus . but , if you not using it work like one professional sports photographers you see sidelines baseball games , you should okay . it also could use extra stop ( or two , or three ! ) because when you handholding , you need aperture open it . all this aside , i really gotten some gems pictures out this lens . it lets you get closer then you possibly could hope . if you asteady hand plently availible light , you get some really nice shots . if you low light situation ... you need tripod . lens works ... pretty good , but i number ever so slightly blurry pictures wouldn't there some more aperature room play . all all , its good starter telephoto lens , especially digital slrs since it really extends zoom those . its great price , when you decide upgrade one those white canon beauties , just sell it	1
i shoot canon 20d used canon ef 75-300mm f/ 4.5 - 5.6 iii usm lens . i've always noticed limitations this lens when shooting amateur softball . i reviewed lens lineup canon website decided canon ef 100-400mm f/ 4.5 - 5.6 usm lens . 100-400mm great lens , but it bit soft . reason i decided add canon ef 70-200mm 2.8 /f usm telephoto zoom lens my lens collection . lens , there numerous features its manufactured high quality materials higher level dust moisture resistance compared standard line lenses . this pro quality lens meant serious photographers . construction sturdy consists 23 elements 18 groups . four super ud-glass elements largely eliminate secondary spectrum reducing residual chromatic aberration . improved 8-blade circular aperture offers more pleasing out-of-focus image . canon ef 70-200mm lens weighs 3.24 lbs/ 1,470 , accepts 77mm filters minimal focusing distance 4.3 ft/ 1.3 . this lens compatible extenders 1.4 ii 2x ii . sure get good quality uv haze filter protect front lens element . white , this lens looks bit strange , but helps keep it stay cool when shooting sun . some people concerned white , it attracts attention criminals . my experience , my 20d attracts attention regardless what lens i put it . addition , i most likely camera bag tripod/monopod me further attract attention . i personally doubt thief looking something steal taking time evaluate cost item more concerned ease taking something they unload . i try make things difficult would thieves insurance back up . dual system two modes . mode 1 stationary subjects while mode two moving subjects . it recommended function not used tripod ; however i used it my monopod success . helps eliminate camera shake helps stabilize lens when shooting moving vehicle . while there limitations what , it give you few extra stops . just keep mind , attempts eliminate camera movement , not movement subject photographed . this lens permits auto or manual focus depending how switch set . there also switch shift 1.4 m/ 4.6 ft infinity or 2.5 m/ 8.2 ft infinity . included this lens tripod mount , lens hood , storage case . tripod mount best option use when mounting tripod . this helps balance load . mounting camera instead creates unbalanced set up may topple over . case zippered soft case ( lz1324 ) also purchased separately . lens hood ( et-86 ) used reduce lens flare protect front element certain situations . often times , amazon recommends purchasing lens case hood , however they normally included lens . canon ef 70-200mm such awesome lens , it almost fails compare canon ef 75-300mm . canon 100-400mm lens well used option me , but clarity sharpness 70-200mm lens more refined . auto-focus quiet quick . this lens used portraits , landscape , sports or general walk lens . f/ 2.8 combined makes this good option certain low light situations . features add creative versatility . canon ef 70-200mm lens comes price , but it worth every bit it . pros : incredible clarity sharpness quiet quick auto-focus features add creative versatility dual system cons : heavy bulky ( this should expected these types lenses	1
i read reviews this lens no one anything bad say it . it fast , crisp , focuses fast , quiet , solid bit heavy . weight vastly compensated all positive features . i used it my 20d just amazed . i just purchased 5d cannot believe my eyes . just great great lens	1
i just finished first set pics this machine surprised amazing sharpness accuracy autofocus , not mention deapth field when compared our older canon digital camera . don't fooled low price , however . 16mb card joke , batteries not rechargable . it best get 1gb memory card battery charger pack right away . price still very reasonable such high quality machine	1
i so much fun this lense managed take some pretty incredible pics . i use this lense probably 95% pics . i 10-22mm , 28-300mm , 100-400mm , all which take great pics but this 17-85mm works great general use	1
if you only going buy one lens your 10 , 20 or 30d then buy this lens . i haven't seen better general purpose lens out there . ef-s 17-85mm takes great photos , especially action oriented situation where you need run around lot get variety different shots different distances . some complained lens overpriced . i agree price , it would nice get hood carry bag thrown , but i say canon impeccable warranty service . i got sand inside my lens autofocus quit while i shooting photos military helicopters landing iraq . i got lens repaired shipped back me within 30 days - baghdad middle war . i able speak human tech fairly easily they even replaced something i clearly broke through heavy use wasn't covered under warranty . repaired lens works perfectly . if you're looking reasonable alternative budget try this lens : sigma zoom super wide angle af 17-70mm f/ 2.8 - 4.5 dc macro autofocus lens canon digital slr camerasbear mind if you issues you're using non-canon lenses canon body , support you get canon limited	1
got it two days ago , can't say how much i love it . my camera fits perfectly , i even put my video camera . although it doesn't wheels , i move head around any direction make it stiff easily . i love double extensions legs then neck extensions minor adjustments .	1
i purchased this gift my brother-in-law . he over 6 ft tall wanted tripod he didn't bend over use . i couldn't find one locally , very happy find this one online . he very happy his gift ! highly recommended	1
i bought generic chinese " equivalent " bp-511 battery boasted higher milliamperage rating cheaper price than original canon battery came my camera . battery worked fine 3 months now only holds charge 20 minutes . i it fail critical times . never ever buy some knock-off chinese battery -- read reviews . chinese push out their crappy knock-offs unsuspecting consumers ( like i ) just make quick buck . also , don't trust glowing reviews generic sellers . they self-generated . my case , seller no longer selling under his original company name . he new name requisite ( sham ) glowing reviews . chinese products suck	1
there many after market batteries this camera every review indicates they not effective , this oem battery sony delivers goods , extremely long lasting power handle not only digital picture taking but all additional flash requirements	1
we traded up original rebel xti . this first add-on we purchased great ! battery grip adds some balance overall sturdy-feeling rebel ... especially , slightly smaller xt xti bodies . good stuff , no regrets	1
it shipd fast verygood buy money look same more expensive canon one plus batterys good brand i think but it realy up you buyer ihave canon rebel it fit verrysnug	1
well , it canon , so there no doubt quality . only downside -- because it doesn't string cap very easy misplace . always put it your pocket everytime you remove it camera shoot pictures	1
i got this lens cap when i ordered close-up lens my camera , powershot s1 , because it recommended something people who ordered part would also order . i , therefore , assumed it went same camera , or lens/adapter i ordering . however , it not appear fit either camera itself or any attachments , so i now wish i some more research determine whether it would actually fit my equipment	1
i previously owned kodak easy share died while i vacation . i loved easy learn use features camera so i wanted camera easy non-professional use . this little camera great ! i've it few months now love pictures ! it very easy use super small which makes it easy throw my purse take anywhere . pictures crisp clear battery lasts forever . my old kodak used take real aa batteries i thought camera its own little rechargeable battery might strange but it actually much easier lasts way longer than aa my old kodak . lcd screen huge makes it very easy review photos . just one little click go review back taking photos . only two downfalls i've found so far little setting dial moves easily its own so you always check it before taking picture or it might some strange setting or video . other thing i haven't able figure out if there way delete all photos camera after you upload them - i've delete them one one which slow process . other than those two little things this camera wonderful ! highly recommended	1
this outstanding camera it size . easy use , easy carry produces great pictures . would recommend anyone who ready give up film go digital	1
this camera excellent one !! really when you compare its price its results level quality you get you know why this best its category , i'm getting very professional results using it lot styles .. highly recommended	1
when i bought this camera sales people tried get me buy battery . they said one came it would only good 20 minutes . now i bought alot items my lifetime , 20 min battery camera just doesnt seem like very good " business " choice . so i said no . so i got camera , charged battery until light went green ( which sucked because i wanted play it right when i got it ) started taking pictures ( oh i also got 2g cf ) worked great .... so i planned go up mountain take soem scenery shots . keeping mind what sales person told me i pocketed charger just incase . well , 6000 ' , 300 pictures , 5 hours later camera still running strong , still 200 shots left trip home , battery life indicator hasnt budged off full button . so all all , i think battery life great , now i see if your taking say thousands pictures all row you may need but just going trip shooting few pictures every stop point , original work fine . quality photos ..... i love them	1
strong rigid , easy control head so you it loose free movement but tight enough camera doesn't flop over . opens closes very easily . it kind expensive $50 but its probably worth money	1
i very pleased amazons quick delivery my new canon monopod . monopod very easy adjust use . it ideal ridgid support you would want your camera . it even doubles great walking stick , sometime need , those long treks you make get good photo	1
... there two things you should know . first f/ 2.8 version this lens big heavy . second f/ 2.8 version this lens more versatile , therefore , more useful two choices . why f/ 2.8 more useful ? it allows you use canon outstanding extenders still sharp practical lens . 1.4 , you very , very good 98-280mm f/4 lens . 2x , you good 140-400mm f/ 5.6 lens . both cases lens autofocus -- very well 1.4 adequately 2x . use canon extenders also allows 70-200 make pretty nice close-up lens . original close focus lens maintained extenders , giving you both 280mm 400mm focal lengths focus closer than most prime lenses same focal lengths . while you use extenders f/4 version , it makes some pretty slow lenses limited applications . there not much you say this lens hasn't already said . it one sharpest zooms around look , while certainly subjective , highly appealing . i preference prime lenses over zooms but i still rank this one my sharpest lenses . there any reason choose 70-200 f/4 lens over this one ? cost aside , i see valid argument made f/4 . carrying around f/ 2.8 full camera bag no fun unless you're putting it use . since i mostly use shorter focal length prime lenses , sometimes f/ 2.8 pain neck me -- literally . unless i know i need it , i taken leaving it behind favor lighter , smaller less sharp canon 100-300 . so i see utility smaller 70-200 . maybe i talk myself into owning both . nah , that little too excessive .	1
this lens fantastic very fast . colors blow you away . 2.8 stop set very fast sutter speeds . i put this lens my reble xt i dont want take it off . love it amazon great .........	1
good quality product which actually measured slightly larger than indicated providing room good sized zoom lens . usual amazon shopping beat all others pricing	1
clearly " rkm001 " some difficulty using this equipment . i one i used part my job . i probably cut over 1000 photos/labels/etc . other people office cut more than 2000 photos . it exactly what it supposed - it cuts straight line edge guide . where this problem arises when cutting surface , underneath cutting wheel , becomes worn use . i grove slowly develop since cutting surface not fixed position slide side side , grove not straight nor it parallel cutting guide . solve this problem , you should not use extreme force when cutting . gentle pressure adequate cutting photo . you also remove cutting surface rotate it 90 or even flip it over . this gives you four cutting surfaces work . ultimately you need replace it . carl makes those too . $20 , it works well unless you plan cut thousands times month , it fine home or light office use	1
i am professional photographer , i owned this camera nearly two years . i also d70 backup . batteries go forever , it very quick respond , images beautiful , it typical nikon durability reliability . if you already nikon user , controls fall easily hand . said , computer software this camera joke . best image quality shoot raw files , color balance grey card , render images software like capture one le . uselessness included software only reason this camera gets four instead five stars . come , nikon , real !!! shortly after i got my first d70 , i shot model small photo side bar catalog . i got ugly feeling my gut when i told designer taken shot 3/4 figure , cropped head shoulders , enlarged image cover 8.5 11 catalog . time i found out , it already printer . it turned out , i pleasantly surprised : cover shot looked great . after incident , i trusted this camera always pleased results . this camera better than 35 mm every way except response shutter button . resolution color reproduction it more comparable medium format film camera . it imperative shoot raw process files properly get most out this camera . i can't wait try d80	1
excellent camera kit . versatile . i lot learn camera , though , it no simple point-and-shoot . however , auto mode , it takes great point-and-shoot pictures . i look forward learning how use it fully . lenses came warranty cards , but camera itself not . i bought sb-600 flash well battery two 1 gb compact flash cards round out kit . camera lens attached large , which i underestimated . $80 camera bag too small it all . great camera , though . price best i could find anywhere	1
i similar battery grip my dig rebel , i never took it off camera . so soon i bought 30d , i immediately ordered this . dual batteries allow me entire wedding ( close 1000 shots ) without ever switch batteries . plus it really improves grip camera heavier/longer lenses . it worked very well me , breeze install	1
i'm very happy product would recommend it my friends . your service also excellent	1
got this my 580ex flashes shooting weddings . works great recycle times excellent . it last entire event filled 2500mah batteries	1
i am not professional photographer , but i wanted high quality lenses go my canon 10d ( which i may upgrade soon ) . i researched over month before purchasing this lens , i not disappointed . i only wanted carry around two lenses , so i purchased this one , canon-ef 17-40mm f/4l usm ultrawide zoom lens . i found this combination works very well me . my uses include photographing landscapes , wildlife , sports events , my family . speed quietness autofocus outstanding , zoom doesn't compromise quality prints . even though price high , you really get what you pay lenses .	1
first , i selection third-party lenses . nothing bad , just none spectacular . i somewhat disappointed shots i got . then i bought 85/ 1.8 saw contrast colors i expecting . since then , i've bought several canon lenses this one my latest . like title says , wow . my first shots house around it all apertures zoom lengths , shots simply incredible . just fantastic sharpness - no ps usm needed ! colors real vibrant contrast sharp clear . this ( my 24-105/4l ) what lenses should . well built , solid great glass . sure , you pay more . you could enhance your shots ps . but see results these lenses vs cheaper alternatives , you'll see what you spent all money for!i'm sold canon	1
like many people my decision telephoto zoom lens came down buying canon 70-200mm f/4l or canon 70-300mm f/4- 5.6 usm . trade offs seemed clear first . former performs slightly better ( see canon website mtf data ) , better designed built , faster " " lens status . user comments ratings ( more than one site ) slightly more favorable lens . 70-300mm improved course longer focal length . both cost same so money not factor my decision . i eventually decided lens initially disappointed . photos ranged wonderful not very good all . fact , i almost returned lens . eventually i figured out problem . my yard heavily shaded so most initial photo taken low light i selected shutter speeds too slow . avoid camera shake you need shoot reciprocal focal length or faster . sounds simple but digital rebel xt ( which i using ) you need consider camera 1.6 multiplication factor . so 200mm you need shutter speed 1/320 or faster not 1/200 like i initially thought . once i made speed adjustment things changed better . still i some mixed feelings my decision . when light good this fantastic lens but feature offered 70-300mm i would probably get photos i miss this lens . i can't fault performance this lens its limitations i given it 5 stars . other words it what it supposed very well but my message other buyers consider where you most likely use lens before buying . remember becomes increasingly important you extend focal length . if your camera already extending it factor 1.6 you may find very attractive feature . ( note 70-300mm recall certain model numbers because problems when using lens portrait position . ) way , i purchased amazon it flawless transaction	1
this wonderful lens great image quality , very fast , very good build quality . no complaints	1
when i worked photojournalist many years ago , 50mm " standard " lens it came closest real world perspective , especially street photography . no longer always true because field-of-view crop many cameras . canon popular digital rebel its successors , example , 1.6 view turns 50mm lens into 80mm lens . 1d mark ii 1.3 view makes it 65mm lens . so , if you're looking standard lens today , 35mm probably closer mark those cameras . canon couple options there - 35 f/ 1.4 great expensive 35 f/2 good value $250 . if you're still looking 50mm , however , there now four options canon : 50/ 1.2 , 50/ 1.4 , 50/ 1.8 50/ 2.5 . here pros cons each : 50/ 1.2 newest , fastest most expensive $ 1,600 . it " " lens , which means it more durably constructed than any others . image quality cut above all others , especially wider apertures . if money no object , you'll probably want this one . but most rest us ask question whether it 5x better than 1.4.50 / 1.4 maligned some softness its images f/ 1.4 , but me its good , compact , low-light lens terrific price ($325 ) . lens gets sharp quickly you stop it down . it sharp f/2 very sharp f/ 2.8 good contrast colors . 50/ 1.8 step down 1.4 speed , image quality , build quality smoothness noise its autofocus . but it big step up value - decent lens $80 . if you're just getting into digital photography , this great lens learn until you get better feel lenses you want/need . 50/ 2.5 - this macro lens , although you use it general photography , too . i wouldn't recommend it . if you're doing macro photography , spend little more 100/ 2.8 , which sharper lens gives you more subject distance . if you're looking standard lens , you'll appreciate wider aperture 1.4 . all said , 50mm canon lenses , i think 50/ 1.4 still offers best mix image quality value .	1
this very good product , price cheap , come bag which plus , if you looking cheap but sturdy monpod , this right one , highly recommanded	1
good quality , particularly amazing price . sturdy , well-made , even case nice . pops open second , collapses just easily . keep mind fully collapsed it wider than standard backpack , so if you lash it under backpack it awkward . but strap carrying case makes it easy loop monopod carry it vertically	1
i say excellent purchase . i'm fan my p880 camera . wide angle len , feature included , allows take great panoramic views , no efforts . manual optical zoom great , gives you control picture i never comercial digital camera . one my favorites features zoom reviewing picture , 10x zoom you check detailed picture lcd screen your pc . 8 megapixels , allows you see great precision minimal details usually you don't see . great experience , when you take picture , return home , picture better than your memory . i'm still learning other features , but rigth now i think great performance-value relation , most important , allow my photos professional touch ,. south worldcarolina	1
i bought my camera few months ago , so i chance figure out most its features , not all lol , but i consider good thing ( extra features means more messing around it ^-^ . well anyways it excellent camera , it all things i want it too , its half price rebel . video it takes amazing record till there no space sd card . me i sandisk 1g securememory sd card i take 27 minutes it which plenty . 38 secounds 38mb internal drive . i take 329 pictures 1g sd 10 internal . battery great it , i used it countless hours havent gotten one bar go down , so 2-3 days use run it down . so i asume 8-10 hours . i never it die me , out me intentually letting it ( i guess its better let battery run out then charge it ) focus zoom feature fun play camera comes really handy ( extra zoom there zoom button top left camera , so you really dont need buy one those cameras 10x ) what else ? well manual features ( biggest reason i got camera)so play ap ., iso , shutter speed they so fun mess , even hue photo which i didnt expect like , i actually got off really good shots . auto features come handy too , just click shoot ! macro neat feature , get close its amazing your shots beautiful ! screen good , crowd around me most still see image screen ( i take video my boyfriend friends sparing)the mic top , it its job ( when its windy you actually block wind without even knowing because your hand while " , off-shoot " button covers it ( good design)uploads pic quickly computer deleting picutres extremely quick easy . af ( auto-focus ) , focus , ae easy get quick fixs other then focus front camera . flash good . well i hope my long drawn out review helpful . i hope you enjoy your camera . i shortly purchasing smaller camera v-logs possible canon sd630 . but yes buy kodak p880 mega-pix simply amazing	1
this my favorite lens . i could not carry heavier long range teles , it hard decision me . end , i chose this because it lighter than zooms . previouly used 75-300 zoom , i leary getting 300mm prime , because i may miss 70-300 range shooting . but clarity colors so true this 300 prime , i don't look back . easy handle , not so bulky . fast , impressive photos . even when i add 1.4 teleconverter shooting 500mm range my 20d . i use f4 alot , no problem , great clarity . awesome lens price	1
this real thing . it seems impossible get anywhere i got it overnight amazon . wow	1
i used my new nikon d200 this past weekend renaissance faire high heat , el3e performed like champ ( camera itself ) . i couldn't believe i got through three full days picture-taking ( using fill flash after five pm or so ) one battery charge . i finally ran out juice late third day , after approximately 500 exposures . ( one caveat : i don't use auto-focus . all . ever . so , you know , ymmv .	1
after 3 decades nikon 35mm film ' loyalist ' , co-worker let me test drive his canon 5d , canon ef 16-35mm 2.8 usm sandisk extreme iii 2 gb card . viewing images his lcd computer screen helped me decide sell almost everything nikon ( i kept their sb-800 flash wireless slave setups ) switch established dslr leader , canon . finally , no more heavy bulky nikon f5 pay wait film processing ! no more scanning negatives hours each night!i've owned 5d , canon ef 17-40mm f4l usm , canon ef 70-200mm f4l usm tripod collar canon speedlite 580ex 3 months taken over thousand raw large jpeg images iso ranging 50 3200 . ( note : 4 weeks ago , backup canon digital rebel xt black body added 70-200 . ) 5d image quality stunned every person i given 4 " 6 " 8.5 " x11 " colour monochrome images . credit must given canon digital photo professional ( dpp ) raw processing software , canon i9900 bubblejet printer , canon paper canon ink . i rarely use adobe photoshop cs2 anymore because dpp quick-to-use tools . above 5d any one lenses flash fits nicely into tamrac velocity 7 bag . larger velocity 9 bag fit entire 2 body lenses flash ki t.t he only negative camera closed compact flash card gate moves slightly it hinge giving body less than solid feel . digital rebel xt not this issue therefore feels more solid . built-in flash would nice but not absolutely necessary . unlike superb nikon sb-800 , canon 580ex bit chunky but it job wonderfully . low noise images iso above 800 easily removed dpp or photoshop . photoshop goes step further removing colour artefacts which lowers saturation image . meaning saturation would increased after noise removal . bottom line : if you believe it costs canon more manufacturer full-frame cmos image sensor don't mind spending several months salary 5d , go it ! also , choose your lenses carefully . canon lenses go well 5d .	1
while 5d may less expensive than so-called professional grade , camera more oriented toward pro end than 20d ( or 30d ) fewer dial settings but more capability . others covered some other areas , so i'll try avoid repetition . full frame makes great deal difference me . i like print large images i like use or other higher end canon lenses ( couple knockoffs ) . there no tradeoff weight consequence or compactness . truth i prefer recent glass isn't computed smaller sensor . i liked 20d , lot , most my gear carries over 5d . i now three cameras take same card battery . 5d if anything feels looks more rugged 20d while very compact . but pictures ? great . 20d first rate camera 8.2 its ability use all canon lenses , plus ef-s smaller digital image . one person cited slowness over 20d . i won't disagree , but it isn't big deal me . i typically use drive bracketing fly , but almost never anything just fast sequence , e.g. sports . i've owned motorr drives going back my days pro 60s 70s they their uses . esssential sometimes . but they like autofocus . occasion , you need manual . whenever possible , i prefer single shot or occasion , three shot burst . i find there less chance missing what i'm shooting . " decisive moment " too often falls frames motor driving . but that everyone taste . i really am impressed camera tried it , look forward trip it , trusty 20d second .	1
i use this lens standard my rebel xt rather than 18-55mm lens came camera . it gives much greater flexibility outdoor shoots when i'm capturing my grandsons action soccer field .	1
this lens all i anticipated more . auto focus fast accurate . i gat stunning action shots	1
bought this lens few months back shot volleyball it , occasionally used it football when it got dark . what i say or add other reviews ?? f/ 1.8 great , although lens sharper f/2 or 2.2 . i use it near wide open edge all time - indoor gyms simply not much ligh t.t he usm autofocus great - demoing it store , it seemed nearly anticipate my actions . no rotating front filter , it doesn't protrude , either . it got full time manual focus ring , so i don't worry killing my autofocus motor . combination . fn 4-1 , this killer . why four stars ? chromatic aberration lower apertures . i not know where it starts go away , because i almost never shoot good light . this most apparent shot recent football game . granted , team jerseys white , background pitch black unlit parking lot , i perform 100% crop . nevertheless , alien-like purple halo surrounded huddled offensive team . oh well , you can't it all ! volleyball pics , this lens . i regularly shoot f/ 2.2 , iso 1600 , 1/500 , but i might change soon because pushing it . photos pretty sharp usm definitely helps here . i bought this lens because my 50mm 1.8 just wasn't cutting it - i'd get shots tack sharp background beautifully bokeh'd subject - just opposite what it should . using 85mm removed 85% those shots . there still extreme instances when i swing my camera around instantly shoot when usm can't keep up , but there other instances when i am amazed it got shot focus . sidelines , 85mm too long get outside hitter nearest you , but that why you move around ! shooting volleyball requires strategy . focal length also good my 350d shooting events staying bit back subject . i'm overall pretty pleased lens . i see what many people call this " hidden lens .	1
this lens changed it all me . i happy my tamrons tokinas - i thought . then i bought this lens . colors contrast simply popped out pics . it amazing ! while there no red ring around it , it deserves one . difference shots incredible . it very well built , focuses ( like all canon usm lenses ) fast quiet provides photog truly beautiful bokeh . low light , it awesome . using extension tube macro , it great . portraits , it nearly unbeatable . so what downside ? sure there one : you'll sold canon lenses . since this one , i've bought five more , including two " " series . if that downside , so it ! just buy lens - you'll love it	1
not much add top other reviews . only thing you should aware depth field f/ 1.8 paper thin , which excellent portraits , but requires perfect focussing . bokeh ( structure background blur ) nothing short great , easily competing much more expensive lenses . yes , it " " quality	1
this monopod great job my camera . you quick , easy-off , it attatches your camera screw , you press button side monopod just slide your camera right off it quickly . i wanted nice , inexpensive monopod my new zoom lense . i canon 35mm , i recently purchased 75-300 zoom lense it , i needed monopod stabilize shoot . if i knew then what i know now , i would buy it again . nice product	1
this lens bag fine product but don't fooled into adding it accessory canon 1.4 or 2x extenders . both them come this exact pouch . amazon should remove this " suggested accessory " web pages two products above	1
this cable very essential need me upload my photos computer . i very fortunate find it amazon.co	1
this cable four-point usb connector works some kodak digital cameras . sure your camera uses four point connector before buying this one . many cameras use five point connector . these kodak branded cables high quality fair price	1
why use case when this one built specifically this camera ? i like it , it sleek belt-mountable . also enough padding so you throw it backpack , suitcase , etc	1
i bought this camera when i sophmore college . now , 2 years out college , handfull beautiful days , half-dozen life changing moments , umpteen vacations later it still goes me everywhere snaps photographs . all sticker labels it since knocked off but it doesn't matter because i know what they all . this puppy built last . when i eventually pass this one down family buy new one , i'll getting canon sure . if you're looking high-value digital camera thinks it tank , get canon s100 .	1
i'm sure there those who'd wax philosophical over subject filters how one brand " much better " than , but my canon ef-s 10-22mm 20d , i figure canon would fairly good making filter they're willing branded " canon . " it fits fine , doesn't interfere lens hood , looks clear , seems attenuate nasty ultra-violet part light spectrum perhaps best all , protects front element . what more would one want	1
what wonderful lens !! i'm purely hobby shooter , but i like take nice shots . i took this zoo other day able take fantastic closeups polar bears , even through glass , pick out details butterfly wings . lens not heavy i feared , unlike some zooms it not telescope out under its own weight , so it comfortable enough keep carrying all day . i'm using it canon d60 am nothing but pleased performance so far	1
portraits sporting events , this wonderful multi-purpose lens . prior purchasing lens , i asked buddy mine ( photographer philadelphia flyers , nhl hockey team long time canon user ) if this quality lens . he told me go it it best buy money distortion spherical abberation extremely minimal this lens . truth told , i've never seen ef lens i didn't like	1
this , my very humble opinion , most useful , sharpest , just anything else good you think say , best wide angle lense ever produced anybody , anytime , anywhere . lightning fast that what you want when light low . my gal pal sara i often wandered caribbean islands dawn early light , she into shooting old homes . she particularly likes gingerbread homes marigot , french side st. martin . i swear she must them all her hard drive . it like obsession her this lens aids her passion , feeds into her manic desire try control light . she just loves it since i love her , i gotta love it too . seriously though , i've used lense quite bit myself it keeper if ever there one . you just go wrong canon " " lense , no siree . jack priest , sailor home se	1
let face it . this great lens . but , i want warn you adorama . i highly recommend you choose better vendor . adorama slow . they don't respond emails . they took week ship my lens when they said it stock . their customer service non-existen t.t heir prices no better than anyone else . almost every time i've ordered them they contacted me try sell me more stuff . ( which further delays shipping)a totally unprofessional organization . i one never order them again . good luck if you	1
this hands down sharpest most used lens i own . combination macro capability , relatively fast 2.8 aperature , prime sharpness keeps it my camera more than anything else . i shoot variety subjects macro nature work indoor sports , this lens never lets me down . one major compliments i this lens its versatility ( i disagree many reviews here . ) i continually find 100mm ideal focal length my 1.6 aps-c sensor xt shooting indoor swimming diving competitions . this length allows beautifully tight framing , slightly compressed depth field , shallow focus get amazing portrait shots while eliminating distracting background . speed lens allows me catch swimmers air without using disturbing flash . this imperative because flash photography prohibited start race . apart sports events , lens allows very intimate portraits without subjects face . this performance macro capability truly make this multi-purpose lens . i usually hand hold sports photography good results ( accessory battery grip my xt invaluable this ) , usually use tripod nature still-life situations . if i've one too many cups coffee i'll use monopod during sports events . i wish lens came accessory tripod collar , because it undeniably fairly heavy piece glass , but it not so important i shelled out one yet . i no complaints af , i find switch limit af range away extreme macro very helpful . once you use canon usm lenses , you never buy anything else . large easy use manual focus ring luxury . it allows quick manual override great control when switching manual focus . many situations i don't want carry my large bag me , 100mm my 17-40mm usually cover just everything i need . ( i know my idea if traveling light not taking kitchen sink however . ) this not lens reasons lack some weather resistance level coatings , but don't let dissuade you . it easily outperforms both my zooms sharpness i find it comparable contrast color . level performance price fraction many lenses makes this unbeatable value .	1
this fantastic piece glass . extremely sharp little artifacts . awesome lens i recommend highly . i love going local botanical gardens mounting this baby my 20d . well worth cost . if you dont tripod , buy one	1
when this lens used 1.6 camera body such xt , 20d , or 30d it ends up giving you amazing 288mm macro or you go one step further 1.4 or 2x tc make it 403/576mm super power . course whenever doing this you must either use tripod or flash except blazing light . it little slow focus compared many other lenses canon offers , but since you most likely using manual focus lot time anyway , this not huge drawback . it also gets heavy carry after few hours you people ask you questions both your their cameras . good note parents pretty good keeping small children out your way when you this lens mounted . narrower background compared 60mm or 100mm macro lenses makes cluttered areas easier deal . extra working distance also plus when working wary insects etc . it best use shutter release mirror lockup shutter speeds longer than 1/30 if you want sharp pictures . 60mm macro wins convenience , but absolute clarity improved working distance 180 comes out top	1
i almost didn't buy this camera simply because plastic body ( i'm used praktica mtl3 film camera , which built like tank ) . however , i'm glad i overlooked because camera top-notch terms robust features quality it provides . startup time very quick making adjustments shutter speed aperture intuitive . if you get bundle kit lens , i highly recommend complimenting it very affordable canon ef 50mm f/ 1.8 ii lens , especially if you big fan dof lot available-light / low-light photography .	1
i love new digital canon . only problem it not nearly tough it film twin . i camera less than month when pop-up flash quit working . canon people great , very helpful , but i'd rather not send brand new camera back factory . photos , however , wonderful . film quality most part - printable enlargable . ( it would probably better use camera tripod when using 300mm telephoto but i hike it , so just remember steady it before taking wildlife photos .	1
i 2 rebel cameras so it just made sense me pick up this digital camera attach my old lenses . while i owned other digitals i keep going back my old rebel , until now . we got back up battery pack . my husband i love it	1
dscw100 8.1 great shirt pocket point shoot easy menu directions added features built	1
my sony dscw100 camera small but very functional user friendly , it makes photography easy interesting hobby .	1
i didn't think it would , but this lens winds up my rebel xt most time . lens compact performs well indoors low light - best use autofocus set center point only . 35mm focal length nice general purpose focal length 1.6 crop dslr . this lens sharp 2.0 really sharp 2.5 -f 2.8 . i lot experience test my lenses tripod/mirror lockup , i'm not just saying sharp 2.0 - it sharp . i considered 24mm 2.8 , but 2.8 pretty slow prime wider focal lengths - loses lot low light advantage . i am impressed colors i getting this lens , wasn't really expecting colors so good such low price point - doesn't lens coatings , but canon colors righ t.t he autofocus speed pretty good - not fast ring usm lenses - it little noisy/buzzy . i currently own 7 canon lenses ( 2 ls ) including 4 primes - this 35mm definitely top bang-for-the-buck lens . ( 28-105 3.5 - 4.5 usm zoom - i don't even like zooms)looking low-light prime ? 240 bucks amazon - just it	1
i am starting my career professional photographer , i haven't any problems these filters . they come nice case , easy attach my lenses .	1
this bag easily accomodates my new canon s3 , lens adapter hood , room spare . recently , during trip europe , i also able fit several other items into bag : rechargeable battery charger , ac adapter , outlet adapter , two sets rechargeable batteries , well uv filter , i still room more . i've no doubt wide- tele-converters this camera would also fit , room spare	1
i would rated this bag ***** if it would little bit larger . it fit only slr camera its lens . no aditional space . actually , there some good spots keep your extra flash cards , you extra battery charger . so , if you want move around your slr least two lenses , get bigger one	1
silver , light , sturdy .. carries camera securely neck or belt	1
nothing wrong this battery . personally i would prefer my camera use aa but battery life lithium ion batteries pretty good . no complaints here except price . but necessity made me purchase second one , not because my other one died , just cuz sometimes i need spare	1
we bought this second battery sony w50 digital camera . these batteries , this camera , last long time . spare allows us keep one external charger swap quickly when needed . it original sony product so fits works perfectly	1
it pretty convinient bag . i put canon rebel xt tamron 28-75 lens , canon 70-300 lens external flash inside i still small pocket wallet , keys etc . only drawback this bag , you not put big lenses . canon 70-300 limit . but if you only limited gear collection , you need give it try	1
i just got back vacation . i bad back , it sore . i very happy discover way this bag hangs , i could carry my nikon d-70 one or two extra lens very comfortably . gear super easy access bag provides nice platform changing lenses . i other bags which heft lots gear , they're great travel days occasional big shoot , but if you're looking hike ( separate way carry tripod ) , then this wonderful bag	1
this bag very sturdy padded . description pretty scanty , but i took chance bought it . glad i . bag holds my jvc gr-dvl805u mini dv camcorder , strap , battery , ac adaptor cord , 4 tapes , remote , all connector cables . it kind tight squeeze all those accesories , but bag compact , comfortable , easy carry , camcorder still protected . bag also comes lifetime guarantee against defect . only thing could improved it awkward get camcorder or out bag while carrying it strap over shoulder ; zipper hard reach goes all way around top . that only thing could improved , could considered safety feature , because camcorder certainly won't come out unexpectedly . bag also very durable nice looking . i recommend it	1
i love using it , long exposure , great bulb . cheap cool .	1
i use it my nikon d50 it works promised . i took some long exposure shots it last night they came out crisp . i am also parent i find using remote much easier than setting timer rangling toddler place within limited window time . i recommend this device anyone i find it quite affordable . like most reviewers , i think it would great if it included accessory	1
this lens super-sharp , colors come out vibrant , it two modes , push/pull ( some people don't like , but your zooms super-fast ) . this probably best canon telephoto lens terms focal range . one bit warning ; it not only fairly large made metal ( not plastic ) , but it kind heavy -- while it doesn't weigh 50 pounds , aware it not light . carrying it around when attached camera , you carry equipment lens , not body	1
i bought this lense recently . first i thought it heavy , but once i got used it , i decided it heavy due quality . it big lense , tripod mount very useful , especially balance . you can't but notice quality this lense . function very useful . combine this lense 2x extender , you've effectively got 800mm lense . anyone looking zoom lense , this one seriously consider . sport , function brilliant , wildlife ... well , i go how good this lense . bottom line - well worth buying	1
this wonderful bag photographer wants light weight bag still hold lot lenses or bodies . bag slings around front allowing user easily switch out lenses without unload entire bag or worry dropping expensive lense . also , bag hold lot accessories . i canon rebel xt bodies 3 lenses just camera compartment . flap opens up user when bag your chest memory card holder , but it hold 8 memory cards which huge ! top small pouch where you tuck away larger objects like water bottle or map . all weather bag cover built into bag so you not worry folding it up storing it . bag cover also velcro pulls latches it onto bag so it stays insuring dry environment inside bag . basically this top notch bag get through anything . yes , i actually used bag few trips find it very user friendy reasonable	1
great product . compact , easy use ( took couple trys ) , feels good able put two large digital cameras , four lenses room more . love it	1
this uv filter produces high quality pictures fraction cost many ather brands	1
uv filter standard filters get . tiffen makes good quality filter this just expected . price equilivant other vendors expected i no problems ; ordering simple product came time	1
exceptional images ! i shoot indoors low light due large aperture . lens bit heavy though ! i choose this lens 24-105 f4l lens . i went 24-70 2.8 wider aperture . i no regrets ! i miss additional reach 24-105 f4l lens , but this compromise i willing make . once again , excellent lens	1
i agree all positive reviews this lens . it great lens , give certain silky smooth bokeh 24-105 lacks gives nice bright viewfinder . it couple quirks though--it very heavy so prepared . lens this quality high speed need lot glass there . -when you zoom out wide , it actually gets longer which bit strange . sometimes when you taking group picture you need zoom out bit fit everyone shot , subjects see lens moving towards them think you going closeup . this partially remedied using included hood which masks lens bit always extended .	1
this wonderful filter . clean your front element , place this filter it , now you never think it again . thread fit very good both ends it . canon 67mm cap fits front this filter perfectly . there even slight raised metal lip so cap doesn't sit against filter glass . well engineered , worth money	1
this my first review here . bought marine pack houseboat trip my sony dsc-n1 camera . it very solid feels great . somehow i mistakenly thought before obtaining it touchscreen could still used when camera installed . though that not accurate , good number other functionality retained ( you switch movie/camera/review modes , zoom , etc . ) . it worked very well trip , it took fantastic photos . we even took several movies going down water slides diving into water ( which isn't suggested manuals ) but still everything turned out perfectly . all all , i'd easily recommend this unit	1
great camera , easy use , great movie quality video cam part . bought 4gb sd card it , so photos just endless	1
2 toddlers , i'm type person who likes camera me capture those unexpected moments film . elph cameras ideal this because they're small lightweight . i used 3.2 mp canon elph before this one , i thought 3.2 good until i started using this new one . clarity stability control sd700 great ! downloading photos my computer takes only seconds . i highly recommend this camera	1
worth money every way . sturdy , compact , great pictures , easy use , easy upload images	1
it doesn't get any better this price point . excellent build quality , very easy use , intuitive . optics simply brilliant kit lense ( 135mm ) . went canon rebel film slr which i loved , but when i tried move into xti , there just no comparison xti d80 . you could immediately feel difference quality functionality . auto-clean feature absolute marketing crap canon . cmos shakes off dust , but then where dust go ? bologna feature , not mention flash nearly knocks your eye out when it pops up canon xti . d80 blows it away , it price there nothing out there better . if your market this price point , or relatively close , just go it . you not regret this purchase .	1
i just purchased this camera lens ( lens different set ) it blown me away so far . pictures just incredible . focus , metering , exposure , flash , color balance ... everything perfect so far . i mainly used camera full automatic mode it really shines . its simple point shoot this mode . i used camera difficult lighting situations photos incredible . there no noticeable shutter lag , which very important me . i 6 yo son who goes smiling one moment looking away next . i missed so many photos past due shutter lag , but not problem this camera . feature helps continuous mode . i take 3 pics second up 100 pics then select best . generally i find i get good pic like 10-15 photos . i used serious photo hobbist during days film , but always problems finding darkroom develop my film . darkroom issue shear cost film paying processing made me abandon hobby . but this camera really bringing back excitement this hobby again without trials expense darkroom . only downside this camera price , but this instance , you get what you pay . you might able save buck or two camera , but i wouldn't even try . i can't imagine camera taking better picture . way , i love this lens . 18 55 mm focal length nice every day lens . its much wider angle then you find point shoot cameras , yet you still get close . i 55-200 mm lens well , but i find i use 18-55 lens more . shorter lens great confined spaces , where you can't easily back away subject , its always better move closer your subject than use long lens ( unless you can't safety reasons ) . my only regret waiting so long get dslr camera this quality . it really opened up old hobby me .	1
after way too much time infront pc reading reviews or camera store counter ( damn i sick it ) , this d80 what i chose . bought it 2 weeks ago then went 10 day trip west . after draging it everywhere i not let me down . price its perfect . i'm still working out exactly how make it work its potential aswell fighting understanding other manufacturers camera layouts my head ) work i rebel xt i bought last year i need its compact casing . my brother canon d30 after he progressed xt friend west coast d200 . experience both i still love what i chose . my biggest reason however going again nikon i already n6006 film camera lens my hope i could use its nikkor af 35-105mm this camera give myself more options . after reading lots reviews whether this possible finally taking lens shop i found it worked fine . experience field last 10 days shown it not work seemlessly buy may well me not lens . 2.5 inch lcd sooo much easier read than rebel xt . info read out top much better placed than one above lcd xt ( if obstructed architectural model shoot i can't see through viewfinder myself , i certainly can't see info screen if its below it ) . i didn't go 18-135 end lens there vinyetting issue high end which bothered me . i got great deal same price cameraland new hampshire d80 ( d70s ) 18-70mm tried trusted lens . fab . now need save up wait release 80-300 vr lens thats coming out . would love 80-400 vr but its 3 times price . my hardest time finiding someone it stock , price i wanted pay , set up i wanted who wasn't trying make dodgie deal ( like some those cheap web based places nyc ) . it really hardest part purchase end . i surprised . many people almost reluctant make sale . it wierd . parts hard get too apparently like spare battery very few places 18-135 lens instock either . anyway enjoy your purchase if you choose this camera . i hope it takes many great pictures you .	1
i market buy new camera last year walked into bestbuy alone just browsing . i older eos canon rebel 35mm camera 1992 , i loved camera too . so this my second camera purchase , not sure what i wanted , but i knew what i wanted take pictures . i take this camera everywhere , vacations , visiting friends family , take pictures scenery , sporting events , people . there lot options this camera i don't know how use , but can't wait learn them too . i upgraded my memory card 1 gb so i take lot pictures not worry running out room . when i travel or go sporting event , i take anywhere 75 200 piictures . i get lot compliments camera photos it takes great	1
this camera all canon says it . fantastic pictures . great flexibility manual control or simple point-and-shoot use . i lot research before buying , i could not happier canon g6	1
i would highly recommend buying canon battery over after-market brand . i bought two non canon batteriesfor my powershot s30 both failed last long original canon battery	1
i canon zr700 camera , it comes one this batteries . since it just giving me little more than hour recording , i felt i needed extra battery . when i saw options , because high price this product , i felt tempted buy oem battery that cost 16.00 usd shipping it good reviews other customers . but them i found canon bp-2l14 here amazon , which gives twice power only 56.00 usd , just 13.00 usd double power original product ( double size too , only bad thing it , but it really not much )	1
i received lenses they all good quality . case comes them also very nice . i worried polarizing lens not working after reading other reviews , but mine worked fine .	1
these great filters especially price ! i looking just one uv filter , after stumbling upon this set which not much more than price one filter , i bought it . these great lenses . i especially like polarizing filter , but all 3 great . definitely worthy buy	1
just what i expected , since this second one i purchased . i one , bought camera this case my daughter . case protects camera lcd screen , but still small enough fit pocket or easily purse	1
this case freaking awesome . i completely turned off 8 dollars shipping i pay , but it definetly worth it . this case looks so nice , so sleek , so beautiful it just feels good your hands . u love this case . i . borrow dollar 8 ppl if u just shipping	1
need clean your digital slr sensor ? this besy way it -- conjunction wtih sensor swabs -- canned compressed air add " junk " which make your sensor worse	1
just use this protect lens . good cheap alternative scratched lens	1
this camera very slim like canon elphs but costs much less . it very high resolution easy use . battery lasts long time 2.5 " lcd screen very clear big . it lot different shooting modes , including custom mode where you set specific parameters like infinity lock or iso speed . convenience , every time you switch modes , screen tells you what mode should used , so you don't need carry around manual figure out how shoot your pictures .	1
we really like this camera ! it whole lot better than our previous one , which ran off 4 aa batteries , ran through so many aa batteries so quickly we can't even guess how many $$ wasted . this optio camera uses very nice rechargable batteries cost $5 each through ebay ( don't buy them here amazon ... ouch ! ) we've got 3 batteries getting two more so we never even worry power while long trip . ( really handy travel charger also awesome ... get it ebay just few bucks . ) startup time shutter speed very fast , so catching quick pictures finally possible us . ( my wife no longer threatens go back film after using this camera ! ) our last camera would take so long focus we never got candid shots we wanted . one only thing that even slight problem this camera power button next shutter button . ( what clueless engineer thought would good ?? ) however , now we've used it lot , we never hit button accident . all other features camera great . 1 gb memory card , we've never ever run out memory space , even taking lots short videos many many pictures medium quality . great camera , worth every cent . buy accessories ebay you'll find getting everything you need not very expensive all . ( actually , we bought camera ebay too , but these reviews great here amazon . thanks , amazon !	1
i hear lot grumbling camera not " perfect . " but guess what ... this size form factor one should not expecting slr-like performance . i just purchased this camera last week busy testing it out variety situations . " full auto " mode pretty decent job figuring out right settings most situations . if you want you take total control set most controls manually . there even bunch pre-programmed setting different lighting situations couple i tested worked great . all all , great camera size . i like fact i put this my shirt pocket forget it then when i suddenly need take picture i always camera handy . i normal speed sd memory card writing out images card painfully slow . this especially true when trying take number quick shots rapid succession . wait camera become ready take next shot annoying . i would highly recommend you purchase one high speed sd cards ( often advertised " ultra ii " or " 32x " or " high speed . " all all great camera if you realistic your expectations you very happy . good luck	1
hoods offer several benefits photographer . primarily hood shades lens stray light may result unwanted discoloration or hazing image , or appearance lens flare . shading your lens helps improve contrast image quality . hood not required eliminate these problems , any item used shade lens provide same protection stray light . hood convenient it built offer protection while ensuring it not inadvertently find its way into your image . photographers often state protective abilities hood reason one . this hood solid petal shapped three three quarters inch long offers some protection keeping moisture wind blown debris off lens element . there nothing more irritating than reviewing your images find dust spots or other flaws . when place , hood protect lens impacting solid objects . replacing damaged hood usually cheaper than repairing or replacing expensive lens . this hood manufactured canon 70-200mm f/ 2.8 ef lens normally comes included lens when sold new . there no need buy one amazon often suggests . since hood wider than lens ; it easily stored attached reverse position . this doesn't add length lens , but make it wider inch . inch may not seem like lot , but tightly packed camera bag , it huge . fortunately canon provides storage case lens used addition your camera bag . while protective benefits exist , they secondary limited . i find impact hood my image quality more convincing reason use hood . considering impact image quality low cost compared my other camera equipment ( except lens case ) , purchasing hood money well spent . pros : improves contrast image quality offers limited protection lens cons : takes up more space your camera bag store len	1
i'm really pleased this bag , it holds all my gear room spare . there enough adjustable straps fine tune bag your comfort level . it stays nice tight against my back doesn't feel like burden all . this great value compared some other options . only drawback this bag there isn't convenient way grabbing your camera without taking bag off opening it up . other than , no faults	1
i needed camera bag greater portability , comfort , security athletic venues well outdoors ( i.e. mountains , valleys , trails , etc . ) this bag delivered . i fit my two primary lenses , telephoto , external flash , colapsing tripod my camera room spare . i even attach my monopod side if needed . i like pockets so extra internal zipper pockets plus exterior side front pockets great tucking away all extras too ; like lense cleaning suplies , batteries , memory cards . backing shoulder straps nicely padded so it wears comfortably well . when i purchased backpack i planned only use it more " active outings " but since found myself using it place my original camera bag	1
i am thrilled this lens capabilities pictures it . i test shot corner window determine if it would good my insect shots i like so well . i bought this add-on converter am thrilled added this 50mm lens these necessary items my set-up . i like nature photography best like use my off summer days hiking finding photographs take perhaps well-known places but finding unique angles subjects what i like specialize . this lens greatly enhance your experience ' little world ' we commonly trod over or weed-ate away . i built diffuser using ping-pong ball over flash so lighting would work better . ( works great , btw ) . usual , it great canon glass trick .	1
i rebel xt 8 lenses thinking getting upgraded second camera body . so when it came out 30d logical choice , but it not really much upgrade 20d , which i resisted , so i not really sure what . then i all but decided just take plunge get 30d when i heard first rumblings xti . then i started learn details xti , more mega pixels , same auto focus , same screen , picture styles , dust cleaning ! only areas 30d won my opinion build quality , spot meter , estimated shutter life . those 3 categories not enough convince me 30d worth $300-$400 more than xti especially since xti won or tied most categories . way i look it camera bodies not nearly important lenses , they change so fast it not worth it me spend more longevity when it outdated year anyway . spend $ 1,500 lens , use it lifetime , spend $ 1,500 camera body , regret it year . i fully expect upgrade 30d released within year , now i saved getting xti i all much more put towards it when it comes out . so basically what i am saying , my opinion , xti just good , if not better than semi-pro 30d , so why pay more ? switching xt xti very simple , i use them both now without any problems . batteries , battery grips , remote shutter release , most other accessories also compatible both , which nice keep amount gear you need carry minimum . unless you want move up full frame sensor , i can't see any reasons why you would not want go this camera . if you read books photography just 1 or 2 years ago you realize this " entry level " camera features not even available top line ($ 5,000 +) camera bodies . speed camera bodies advance you might well buy entry level body every year instead making huge investment pro level bodies then shown up something 10% price year or two . not there not reasons buy one those bodies , i just don't seem any them	1
i've considered other , higher priced digital slrs , such nikon d80 canon 30d . however , i decided i probably won't using some more advanced features offered those cameras , would rather spend money saved better lens . terms picture quality , all these slrs capable equivalent quality . currently i 3 lenses , kit 18-55mm , 50mm f/ 1.8 , 85mm f/ 1.8 . i don't use kit zoom lens anymore because i favor faster , prime lenses . i mostly take pictures my children , 85mm f/ 1.8 excellent portrait lens . it sharp , fast , produces beautiful background blur . zoom lenses unfortunately not sharp or fast , unless you're willing pay much more than cost camera body . i think all novice slr owners should buy cheap canon 50mm f/ 1.8 , discover what fast lens when you set aperture 1.8 , take some portraits . you too professional-looking results	1
i got this lens complement my 10-22mm 100-400mm lenses . it great general purpose lens ( not too wide , not too narrow ) everyday walk around shooting . image stabilization constant aperture nice features . it also weather sealed so you don't worry elements much most other lenses , course you would need weather sealed camera body completely safe , but it still makes me feel little better sandy or snowy conditions . i use this rebel xt rebel xti which 1.6 crop bodies make this closer 38-168mm which useful portrait work , landscapes , large animals , or somewhat close macro . course there lenses all these things better , but get this all one package really valuable . after all you less likely miss shot if you 1 versatile lens vs . 5 really great specialized lenses ( not you shouldn't get those too , but this good all around contender . ) i posted few photo examples above show range colors versatility this lens . it not sharpest lens i , nor fastest , but it one my camera most often unless i am going out shoot something specific . if you don't want spend quite much , 28-135mm also very good lens	1
this great range use every day walk around lens . it very versatile , light produces great image sharpness throughout range . there bit vignetting wide end , which i actually like . however , f4 , this lens simply not fast enough me . i shoot lot images where i want out focus areas ( bokeh ) glassy smooth ( weddings , portraits such ) you cannot get this lens good you 24-70 2.8 . 24-105 f4 lens image stabilization which help you hand hold get shot lower light situations , but there not much get super smooth bokeh it . if you zoom all way , your dof low pretty darn smooth though my case , i just prefer look bokeh 24-70 overall rather than this lens . although 24-70 super heavy weight compared 24-105 . but i'm professional photographer so while my needs likes geared towards preferring 24-70 2.8 , this doesn't mean 24-105 isn't ideal many if not most .	1
if you don't want get hooked canon series lens , not buy this one . i made mistake buying one now all i want canon lens . it super sharp , contrast saturation fantastic . no need retouch any your photos . so far , i've used it candid shots my kids dance gigs . f/ 2.0 helps lot get right shutter speed freeze action . very good buy . i got mine here amazon	1
this lens best its class . i wish every lens i this sharp . this thing top notch	1
lowepro case 4 great case long telephoto . it well padded , well-built protects lens very well . however , i tried use it small lowepro rezo 190 aw found ( even using sliplock attachment ) it completely unbalanced bag . it so uncomfortable unpredictable , i finally gave up bought lowepro aw magnum ( where all gear i use fits inside bag ) replace both . i now just use case 4 storage purposes or bring telephoto car when i'm " hand-carrying " . i believe it would work much better attachment medium size bag where lens case could hung other side bag better balance weight	1
i'm very happy this lens . it offer ample variety options , high image quality it light	1
this lens truly ' must ' if you don't lots cash spend . simply put , it excellent performer money . i recently got this lens my rebel xt , noticed huge improvement over 18-55mm kit lens . sharpness improved considerably . 18-55mm some serious issues area . first all , sharpness really bad large apertures . but smaller apertures not really much better . 28-105mm still not best performer large apertures . but it much better than 18-55mm . however , around f8 or higher , 28-105mm tack sharp . addition , this lens not suffer problem clear foreground soft background my 18-55mm suffers . color accuracy also greatly improved 28-105mm . colors look much more natural this lens than 18-55mm lens . this particularly true lighter colors , especially when you go increase saturation photoshop ( or other software ) . increasing saturation improve appearance dark colors picture taken 18-55mm would typically make lighter colored objects look very unnatural . this sort problem much reduced 28-105mm . i should also say this lens appears overexpose somewhat compared 18-55mm . this more good than bad , however , it effect making lens faster . course , this lens not without its drawbacks . i mentioned slight softness large apertures , instance . also , it not fastest lens out there . but then again , what you expect price ? finally , 28mm not exactly wide angle cropped sensor digital slr like rebels or 20d . but despite these drawbacks , this lens really performs like champ . when used its element ( ie higher f-numbers ) , it works quite well . also , since it not ef-s lens , it not become paperweight should you decide upgrade 5d .	1
well i too recieved " grey market " version product , international warranty only . this mentioned before , apparently rectified amazon , i hope i'll recieve same treatment . but this still troubles me . amazon continuing sell off cheaper merchandise , only addressing issue individual basis when people complain ? what grey market means product originally intended sale outside us , but imported because version product cheaper than version intended us sale . while it legitimate enough process , they should telling us if they it , because warranty invalidated sold outside boundaries system canon put place . i'm not even touching hardware until i find out what going it , so i can't rate its quality .. but i no doubt it quality piece hardware , i've never heard anyone anything bad say it , except its price , gripe i totally agree . let face it folks , if it wasn't proprietary accessory high priced camera system , it should really cost $20 . it just simple programmable timer no more sophisticated than most wristwatches	1
i enjoy tc80n3 . you may think it costly , but features out standing . i think it worth buy . only disappointment i there no " , off " power switch	1
it works great - no touching sensor brush . great produc	1
i bought this gizmo clear cmos detector my digital slr camera . it seemed like good alternative using specialized , expensive sensor wipes , it would not invalidate camera warranty . results my camera good but not perfect . many large particles dust blown off detector . however , some medium-sized particles merely pushed edges . nonetheless , i really like air blaster just my camera . aside my camera , i used this number other devices around my home office . it works particularly well clearing dust out vents my laptop underneath keys my laptop keyboard . however , it works poorly clearing out dust grime my desktop keyboard . summary , i would say this good device owners digital slr cameras , although it not perfect substitute sensor wipes . owners electronic equipment general , this clever device works reasonably well cleaning dust out some places	1
this absolute do-everything flash , master/slave operation , wireless control multiple channels slave flashes , : : lighting ratio control ( better than st-e2 mere : ratio ) , full manual or automatic operation , strobe effects selectable herz rates power , even small panel serves either widen its flash coverage 17mm or simply provide catchlight model eyes when using bounce flash . range excellent , battery life very good compounded one battery packs . light itself provides excellent color , red lamp near base adds much more accurate less harsh focus assist lamp than most canon cameras provide . if you slr , you'll almost certainly want external flash . you provide fill flash reduce shadows subjects eyes etc . during harsh daylight shots , take flash off camera eliminate nasty shadows , avoid shadows caused larger lenses onboard flashes . minor quibbles : most dslrs crop ratios 1.3 or 1.6 , but don't pass this information 550ex , which wouldn't care anyway . this means flash thinks you want greater coverage than you really need ( i.e. it give you 50mm angle flash coverage , when you only need 80mm ) , so you waste lot flash power don't get optimum recycling times . also , interface little non-intuitive . if you want slave- or onboard-only flash don't need all extra features , considerably cheaper 420ex you . said , if you want all extra features , 550ex still not you . you want 580ex , slated october 2004 release , which fixes minor issues 550	1
i got this camera back may lost it ( but this camera seemed best ) . i ordered same camera amazon but return it because one pixels blown . i got my replacement but amount time it takes take picture eternity . look some other camera . if people posing you better hope you get it 1st shot , because if you don't it takes too long take .	-1
camera perfect solution someone who not want exchangable lensesand some items more professional results . combined direct photo printer it easy fun plenty photo options dial . my only problem i not receive camera software alllow me download computer memory chip itself . there any way get this software	1
... it diffuses light energy flash different directions , essentially turning flash into point light source . light going off different directions then bounces off nearby objects fill shadow areas subject , making more pleasing softer look , especially people . note caution : because this device diffuses light flash , it takes much more energy per flash . using stofen drain your battery much quicker ( 4x my experience ) it takes flash much longer fully charge after each shot , say 8-10 seconds vs 2-3s . always keep spare set flash batteries you . note ... because it requires bouncing light nearby objects effective , using this outdoors not recommended . you're better off removing omni-bounce aiming flash directly subject ( living harsh lighting ) .	1
this isn't full review but some thoughts i've after using it long time . stabilization- fact if this camera you take everywhere you , you going either lose shots or use flash . if flash doesn't bother you , no sweat . but i've never like look it . ease-of-use- great . voice memo- i use this feature all time . it would nice if it pause button because without it i end up many small files . ex- this where you set exposure . casio great job putting everything one place . only thing they should better if you changed selection ( e.g. iso 200 400 ) hit shutter release it should take shot . instead nothing happens . you click set first . it extra step you make during critical time	1
i spent weekend researching digital cameras , exhausting confusing , so many choose , when i store looking various cameras , customer just started telling me how much he loved this camera he just bought , which this one ; i assumed it ' sign ' . it . small size fantastic , put your shirt pocket or purse , almost weightless . quick shutter takes best pictures new baby grandchild any camera anyone family used . ( others sony canon digital cameras ) movies excellent . quality color images perfect , not too over-digitized some said . everyone family thinks i'm wonderful photographer , but it not me , it this camera . battery life really long , it take good pictures multiple types poor visibility situations . first month , i dropped it few times , once sidewalk it survived which impressive . viewfinder big advantage bright sunlight . after using loving it 9 months , telephoto froze . i sent it back casio , they fixed it ; it took 3-4 weeks , which little long , but not charge me repair . baby pictures fantastic , especially because it takes picture so fast , scenery pics all look like national geographic .	1
this lens top notch . quality photographs best i ever experienced camera .	1
new canon ef-s 60mm 2.8 macro usm digital slr lens designed cover entire field digital imaging sensors canon digital slr line , most notably canon eos 20d . this corresponds film normal lens perspective approximately 50mm lens . furthermore it benefits canon usm autofocusing technology , allowing photograher rapid , almost silent , autofocus , which important when working field ( you don't want distract animal you photographing sound lens focused . ) . although this lens not series lens , quality its construction comes close canon premium series professional line lenses . indeed , i read elsewhere excellent test report ( i believe erwin puts website ) this lens praising its optical performance . any canon user digital slrs such eos 20d who interested macro photography regard this lens absolutely essential making great macro images	1
what i say ? it fits place overpriced canon nb3l battery my sd500 lasts longer than oem battery . quality battery external very good . no sloppy glued edges or ill-fitting parts . battery works very well camera lasts longer one hundred or so shots . i use gig card so i tend shot alot once . even flash battery life comparable canon or even longer . i bought two instead single canon battery i not dissappointed	1
i purchased my 300d may 2005 , when xt released this 6.3 mp model price began falling . i'd really pick this camera apart tell you downsides it ; disregard reviews those who think this camera not up par -- course it not comparable eos 1-series or 5d , so don't expect same features or capabilities . right user , however , get similar results . said , unless you professional photographer , i cannot imagine how digital rebel could inadequate any amateur or semi-pro shooter . it speed megapixels since passed , but it still , especially now , great buy . kit lens perform you just fine , although most my shots kit lens 18mm , landscape or just wide-angle shots . flash works very well most situations , even extremely dark rooms . one guy complained his af hunted low light situations , even flash ... course , what you expect dark room ? use manual focus grow up . quality great iso 100-400 , although 800 somewhat ugly times , 1600 basically unusable , especially if you're not shooting f/ 2.8 or bigger . my main complaints : slow start-up time compared newer models ( xt , 20d , etc ) ... camera seems out breath after continuous shooting ; take 8 shots quickly you may notice camera needs process info before it shoot again . 2.5 frames/second not very fast if you're shooting any sports . overall , this camera incredibly reliable me ; it gotten me front page shots newspapers , magazine covers , calendars websites . i used it so much i blew out shutter 10 months ; canon fixed it no charge it works fine since . one minor problem : very rarely , it won't turn unless i remove battery re-insert it . i've found battery life fantastic . i use it all day , even flash , still some life end day . backup battery your bag should give you more than enough insurance day . i've printed 11x17 excellent results . some practice , it very easy navigate . menus options simple ; changing iso or aperture very easy despite what some complained . it very reliable fully-auto mode well , especially if you're shooting flash . memory card reader must when uploading images . overall : it old news world digital slrs , but right now , new or used model such good price really great value	1
i owned canon eos digital rebel 6.3 mp several weeks now love it . fantastic pictures features . i worked slr many years . figured it time " move up " digital slr glad i . this camera plenty features available , or you just set it " auto " works fine , too . though optional flash not needed most photography i wanted one far shots such . canon makes several models dedicated this camera , but i find them weak ( 220ex ) or costly . shop carefully trying find compatible flash . it needs " dedicated " digital rebels . one work af ( auto focus ) or slr ( film ) rebel may not work right . i also received conflicting information ritz camera , both on-line stores . bottom line , if you need flash , shop carefully ask all right questions . personally i held off buying one hoping more models lower price come out . camera already small pop-up flash . btw , tamron af 70-300 macro 1:2 zoom nice lens buy it , priced nicely beach camera	1
manufactured soft gray felt like material , tough leather bottom , draw string closure top , this lens pouch helps protect your lens dust elements . i store my lenses camera bag , these cases fit nicely around lens taking up little precious space . this case meant use canon ef 135mm f/2l usm , ef 24-70mm f/ 2.8 usm , ef 24-105mm f/ 4.0 usm , ef 28-70 f/ 2.8 , ef 50 f/ 1.0 usm , ef 85mm f/ 1.2 usm lenses . these lenses normally come case when sold new . there no need buy one amazon often suggests . however if your case worn , replacing it protect your lens recommended . pros : protects your glass investmentcons : i cannot think	1
this camera great photographing artwork . it only camera i could find doesn't bow edges paintings or watercolors ( i think lot cameras lens distors things , but you can't tell until you photograph something supposed rectangular ) . color reproduction also good . if you want camera takes good pictures distant objects , or one higher than 2mp resolution , look camera .	1
there nothing like telephoto bring boats anchor up close when you're halfway up mountain . i got great shot tahiti just way just this lense friend mine used it cover her romance novel . it true lense heavy . canon says it weighs 1.7 pounds , but it seems heavier . no matter though , because you won't go gym if you heft this baby around awhile , side benifit , you'll get crisper , sharper photos then you would any other 200mm out there today . just think it body building photo shooting both same time . also this one won't break your wallet . serously , this one darned fine piece glass , you just simply cannot go wrong canon " " lense , just can'tjack priest , sailor home se	1
many people think this kit lens . it not ! numbers match , but kit lens not usm worth 1/2 price . go canon web site take look lens chart . this lens much faster better glass than kit lens .	1
i chose purchase this lens over standard 18-55 comes kit xt . it functions smoothly seems worth difference definitely upgrade .	1
works great point-and-shoot auto mode . camera just enough advanced features keep novice photographer happy long time . battery life great if you purchase top quality rechargables . large , least 1g sd card , should used . image stabilization works well . tripod necessary if using camera full zoom	1
fairly decent . produces pictures optical blur edges if you use zoom . leaves black semicircle pictures taken flash 1/5 way up bottom picture because flash isn't tall enough miss wide lens . other than .. it capture few more degrees . if you going pick this or telephoto attachment , get this .	1
i compared number pro-sumer cameras became firmly convinced this best camera money . although nikon one time considered premier camera professional , they now take second stage canon not only engineering , but quality lens , innovative user-friendly design , overall quality . i used camera approximately one month delighted . talken pictures over 35 years - including professional - always using minolta equipment all those years , i am truly enamored this canon camera	1
those who truly know digital cameras , more than perhaps 8 megapixels important only if you plan blowing your images up " poster size " , or if you pro who knows how use all those pixels . truthfully , how many you really plan type stuff ? say rebel xti better than 30d because it " more megapixels " " smaller " not best advice . any canon dslr going give you great images , if know how use it . those you who trying decide which camera buy , you really need go camera store ask handle each camera . while you're it , ask yourself how it feels your hands . it too bulky ? it too small hard handle ? it features you want such spot metering , which rebel xti not ? 30d terrific dslr . it all features 99% us need . there reason why it costs more than rebel . 30d better camera overall .	1
these second set filters i purchased i am absolutely love it . i buy new set because my other lense 62mm these 58mm . it produced outstanding colors great quality filters . i would recommend it , price , that how much you would pay polarizer filter alone	1
pros : - reduces flare ghosting when shooting bright light . - helps protect your lens dirt scratches . - somewhat protects lens case fall . better break hood than front element . - makes you look more like you know what you doing helps keep others carelessly walking front you . cons : - increase lens movement windy situations , kind like sail boat . - takes up more room your bag , even when reversed they still add diameter lens . - people take more notice you , help blow your cover if you trying keep low profile	1
this great camera , easy use , love quality even best , got this quick amazon prime . highly recommen	1
i bought canon powershot s2 year ago , taken 2,500 photos 15 video clips it . overall , i am very happy it , if i buying new camera today , i probably would get s2 or s3 . things i like s2 : * extended zoom ( 12x ) . i use it often . * image stabilization . particularly helpful when using high zoom factor , or when shooting low light low iso setting . it makes handheld shots slow shutter speeds possible . * electronic viewfinder means " what you see what you get " , just like slr . while not sharp optical viewfinder , ability frame picture without worrying parallax more than makes up it . fact , one advantage over slr there no mirror it move out way , therefore there no mirror noise when taking picture ; if you turn off electronic sound effects , it very quiet indeed ( although not completely silent ) . * screen moves rotates . i like it closed ( turned toward camera ) thus protected scratches . i used it folded out rotated forward order see myself self-timer photo . i used it take " clandestine " pictures -- holding camera down near my waist , i still see screen if i rotate it towards me . i also used it take pictures while holding camera above my head -- above crowd , instance , or over wall . * multiple-picture mode . similar motor drive film cameras , this allows me take several pictures quick succession holding down shutter release button -- 2 pictures per second . unlike some cameras , only limit number pictures amount available memory . * it used all-automatic mode , all-manual mode , or just any combination . even near-automatic mode , several exposure settings adjusted . * very good movie mode . it shoot vga-quality picture ( 640x480 ) 30fps . while results not good my 3-ccd dv video camera , i am much more likely this camera me than video camera , i really like option taking reasonably high quality video . i used it several times . * stereo microphones . decent sound video . also used adding sound memo still picture ( e.g. " this such-and-such place , blah blah blah " ) , or just recording sounds unrelated any picture . i used this couple times record " sound memory " place ; one botanical garden spot where scenery wasn't especially pretty , but sounds frogs made like nothing we heard before ! * separate buttons still pictures movies . easy remember which which . * manual pop-up flash . some people don't like flash doesn't pop up automatically when needed . i actually like this feature , because often i want shoot without flash when camera thinks i need use flash . course i force flash fire even bright daylight when camera thinks it not necessary -- although while i kept forgetting how turn feature , even though it pretty obvious ( there button right next flash ! ) . things i don't like it : * poor low-light performance . more precisely , poor performance high iso settings . camera fine low light if you leave shutter open long enough , or use flash . but if you kick up iso 200 or 400 ( equivalent " fast " film ) so you take indoor shots without flash , you end up very noticeable graininess pictures . this my number one disappointment camera . however , i don't know comparable camera better ( sample pictures i seen , s3 isn't any better ; i don't know why they bothered add iso 800 setting -- it seems completely useless me ) . i know there cameras , but they cost lot more . i saw pictures taken indoors canon 20d slr phenomenal . but besides added expense , camera like also bigger heavier , therefore less convenient . * camera too big pocket . i would love camera capable this would fit my shirt pocket , or least my coat pocket or smallish holster . i would take it more places if it wasn't so big . * yet , same time , it little too small my hand . grip just doesn't feel right . grip 20d felt great ! however , it just right woman hand -- my wife likes it fine . * no filter threads standard configuration . big lens like practically begging fingerprints or scratches . i solved adding conversion lens adapter , which filter threads ( more this below ) . * lens cap held friction . this both pro con . it good because lens extends when camera turned ; if lens cap attached lens simply push it off . it bad because cap could come off when you don't want it . this moot point conversion lens adapter , standard lens cap no longer fit . * default exposure too bright . not every review mentions this , but apparently it fairly common canon cameras . fortunately , this easily fixed setting exposure adjustment ( i set mine -2/3 stop ) . i haven't figured out how adjust exposure movies , though . i need look manual see if it possible ! if you buy s2 ( or s3 ) , i'd suggest also considering : * canon lah-dc20 lens adapter hood set . i mentioned above , this allows you add filter protect lens . currently $37.10 amazon . * 58mm skylight or uv filter screw lens adapter . * 58mm lens cap cover adapter/filter . canon 58mm snap-on lens cap currently $9.99 amazon . * high-speed sd card , least 512mb , but 1gb or 2gb would give more space movies . ( i use sandisk ultra ii plus , which added benefit able directly plug into standard usb port without adapter . ) * rechargeable nimh batteries . i don't any yet , but this next thing my list . i've gone through way too many aa batteries ! nice option available this camera tc-dc58b tele converter lens . this gives you maximum zoom equivalent 648mm 35mm camera . amazing ! i not purchased it yet because so far built-in zoom sufficient my needs . there also wc-dc58a wide converter lens taking extra-wide-angle pictures . after you get camera , you'll probably want case some type it . there * lots * cases choose . after trying few looking lot more , i finally settled tamrac velocity 4 . it may or may not what you need case , but there it fyi	1
i purchased this my new canon 30d dslr . i mainly use it fills outside sunny days , but it used light up situation . i'm personally still learning how best angle light get best outcome , but i don't think it'll take long	1
this great unit . works great purpose which it made . i'm going eventually get 580 so i use it slave unit ( wireless option ) wraparound lighting system . i would recommend diffuser so light subdued especially when you wish brighten fleshtones people photo golden light so they presented their best image . blue spectrum light not present us best way	1
i bought this lens replace ef 100-300mm ( usm ) we my wife film shooting days ( not common lens , apparently ; 75-300mm seems more widespread ) . older lens produced some surprisingly good pictures ( quite sharp ) , but handheld shots hard get right long focal lengths . image stabilization feature this lens works remarkably well , but it quite bit noisier than ef-s 17-85mm ( my first lens ; you hardly hear gyrations all one ) . sharpness quite good ( probably tad better than ef 100-300mm , although it not foremost strength this lens my opinion ) . i surprised how much faster i acquire focus this lens , even though reviews suggested it still falls short l-series lenses ( see e.g. " flying gull " shot i uploaded " customer images " set ) . if you want shoot hand-held 150mm+ , i don't think this lens much competition under $1000 canon eos users	1
after debating this 70-200 series i decided purchase this lens . i pleasantly surprised results . i also own 17-85 50mm 1.8 lenses i found i gotten " most pleasing " results this lens . pictures very sharp my 20d - even 200mm - 300mm range . i've also happy quality bokeh . primary drawback i see af tends hunt fair amount when confronted low contrast images . said , i used it some flying bird shooting wildlife refuge surprised see how many shots sharp focus . however , it little bit all or nothing . several shots also wildly out focus . since lens fairly slow focus , you never know what you're gonna get such fast moving object against distant sky . i much more consistent results when shooting soccer , softball football park . af speed not present issue any these activities results excellent . i wish lens little less expensive but i prints i gotten my 13 19 printer worth extra money	1
wonderful camera . very flexiable , very versitile . most wonderful creation device someone whom capable . def good buy now 30d out . i've this camera over year i still love it	1
impressive feature list wih affordable price , serious ameteur . i've using 20d 18-55 , 50mm 1.8 , 35-80 , 80-200 500/1000mm lenses . i am not disappointed . i am planning upgrade series lenses but slowly . i not mean over entusiastic canon , but i am yet see nikon camera same specs same or ever near equal price . i've got fm10 film photography . i love both my cameras . impressive features include : mirror lockupiso 3200 noise reduction18 custom functionsaccepts entire series canon lens . heavy metal body ( no cheap plastic feel	1
i bought this camera 2 months before my son born . i knew little digital slrs , but after research i found this one me . this camera well constructed durable . pictures excellent . i blown few my pictures up 11x17 without any problem . also , if you going doing any editing photos your computer , this camera would great . i would recommend purchasing newest version photoshop or photoshop elements ( when i bought mine it only came elements 2.0 3.0 already market ) . also , if you want your pictures turn out , you must purchase larger flash . onboard flash weak , leave shadows it not allow you any type " bounce " flash . whole , this best camera i ever my life it would great anyone who previous experience slr cameras .	1
i took few identical photos without this filter , saw no difference sharpness nor contrast . so , if you're looking save damage your lense , this way go . i like able clean this filter quickly . otherwize i would spend 10-20 minutes cleaning lense so very carefull not scratch it . also , it minimize uv haze ... but i havn't compared with/without type situation . ( please comment if you different opinion ... ( brand )	1
i looking medium range zoom my d-70s reasonably fast sharp throughout zoom range . this lens first class winner all areas . it my first vr lens ( vibration resistance ) alone makes it worth cost . no more tripods ! it smooth operation feels very solid ( if not little heavy ) use . f/ 2.8 speed coupled 8 aperture leaves gives velvety smooth bokeh ( desirable soft blurred background ) makes your subject snap right out shot . len razor sharp 70mm 200mm . if there any distortion , i haven't seen it . lens this long , ghosting might show up if you shoot almost directly into sun . huge hb-29 lens hood helps lot . again , i not seen any ghosting yet . this definately pro/pro-sumer len its price tag alone re-enforces fact . if you afford it , remember golden rule ... it lens makes picture not camera . all pixels world can't make up poor lens . if you ready play big boys , then this belongs your bag	1
i love this lens . this excellent complement my nikon 28-70 2.8 . it well balanced d200 f100 ( mb grip ) . just last weekend used family wedding . it really not lens casual photography . if you not willing tolerate heavy equipment , sincerely , you take much better pictures ps digital cameras , i sometimes . after all taking pictures capturing moments if this lens get into your way , it no use . i personally only prefer fixed 2.8 apertures across zoom range . this very important me since i like use mostly aperture priority especially taking people pictures . why i love this lens . this very expensive lens . if vr not important you , go more reasonably priced almost identical optical qualities nikon 80-200 2.8 . me vr very important since i cannot afford use tripods when i am moving around taking pictures my kids or friends . if you could afford it , it great lens you never regret . if you cannot afford it just you thinking purchasin expensive camera body , don't waste your time camera specs , d70 vs d200 vs d2xs etc . buy cheaper camera , but still buy this lens long you willing carry heavy equipment around comitted take pictures such heavy equipment . bokeh amazing , rich contrast , creamy blurring behind subject 2.8 simply delicate delicious	1
it better save camera real lens which replaced this filter broken than expensive lens behind it . this real " lens saver "	1
this very good compact camera , but there few things make some pictures problem . when shooting low light conditions there seem lot problems flash , especially if i take pictures kids . flash makes person/object way too light , no matter what kind flash i use auto/on/red eye etc . if i try not use flash , then there lot blur . when outside bright sun most images way too light . i very grateful anyone who knows how resolve these problems . it little frustrating . i tried every possible setting , but so far no luck	1
this camera fits easily my pocket takes fantastic pictures ultra compact . it easy use i no problems it	1
i very small camera ( canon sd450 ) find this tripod perfect match . it light small easy carry included canvas case . it few nice features i didn't expect ( even though i read text ! ) like bubble level platform . this product excellent value . however , shipping cost much tripod . course , not tripod fault .	1
this stuff worth your small money , useful your precious cameras	1
i think this best buy anyone , superfast , flexible ( 50-3200 asa ) interchangeble lenses , long last battery , all excellent , only bad thing high price but it worth it , its like ferrari , almost you want keep it home case something bad happens like stolen or damaged even some people say big size inconvinencie i personally would not like tiny camera professional photographer it woud look ridicoulous , so size good thing also , when people even dont know camera impressed stuff it	1
i am pro photographer who formerly used medium format . i wanted get digital slr better than film quality . eos 1ds mk ii it ! it weather/dust resistant ( point ) when combined canon " " series lenses , if you own this body , those lenses must-have . controls easier master than i first thought . it fast , no shutter lag fast write card . colors details shadow/highlights amazing ! truly joy hold ! if you want best , this it	1

canon 250d 500d doublet type close-up lenses which corrected chromatic abberation ( " achromat " ) . they offer better performance than less expensive singlet type lens . i happy performance these lenses used ef 100mm/ 2.0 , even when used stacked together higher power ( which canon not recommend )	1
this pouch godsend so i bought 2 . i use them my efs 60-mm efs 85-mm lenses . base feels firm so lens sitting inside protected won't go anywhere made out strong naugahide . pouch itself thick felt rope pulls made heavy nylon twine feels silky your hand . whole pouch well built protect but handled roughly still protect contents , your precious lenses	1
i've quite satisfied my nikon d50 i've using built-in flash occasionally get evenly lit images balanced exposed shots . but built-in flash just doesn't cut it . i made huge mistake taking pics my cousin wedding reception huge hall thinking tripod , high iso settings , built-in flash suffice . i wrong . i borrowed fellow photographer spare speedlight ( sb-600 ) when i downloaded pics my computer some fine tuning , i noticed huge difference built-in flash . speedlight gave me more area covered flash . roughly under $200+ , this quite bargain . i'd recommend rechargeable aa batteries . recycle time flash fast .	1
i bought this flash use my nikon d200 it works better than i hoped . you fine tune it your own personal liking it more options than i am currently smart enough use . but don't worry , you don't super camera geek get great results right off bat . this thing great " reach " it actually zooms right your lens pinpoint your subject . it just audible enough let you know it doing . i'm definitely glad i bought this thing . much better than small pop-up flash	1
i just upgraded 20d , speed just blows 20d out way !! image quality runs same both cameras since they're both 8.2 mp , but how camera gets you those images simply amazing . fastest shutter out there , low noise , consistent color , spot metering , multiple spot metering , weather sealing , list goes !! this camera demands best glass , but you won't sorry . if your serious photography any field , this camera won't disappoint !! bit pricey , but believe me , it worth every penny !!!! see some my work ( ...	1
this great tool those shots where you want get down low . macro work landscape/waterscape shots near ground so much easier angle finder than without . i also used it when doing portrait work get more flattering angle without kneel or stoop over whole time . now negative . it fogs up much easier than normal eyepiece , which makes seeing anything challenge under some conditions . big one me , especially macro work , you loose some light when using angle finder . so if you already working low-light situation , this only makes matters worse . but well-lit conditions where fogging not issue you want shoot low , this amazing accessory , thus 4 out 5 stars	1
this excellent camera ! i purchased mine feb . ' 06 used it continually 2+ months before i decided write this review . first , i am avid amateur photographer , i wondered if this camera would worth expense , non-pro . i've found i not regret this purchase any way . i researched it several months even bought digital rebel xt first , thinking i'd rather not spend so much camera ( i like rebel xt it fun back up camera ) .... i confused which camera choose . most official reviewers either not review it , because there not " much " difference btw . it id mark ii or simply said if you wanted shoot sports or fast action , then 1d mark ii way go . i don't shoot those ... i'm wedding/portrait person . however , i also shoot landscapes fast moving animals well wanted weather proofing speed comes mark ii . so choosing 5 , ( time ) upcoming 30d 1d mark ii very difficult . one pro review site said mark ii needless upgrade mark ii . i found odd remark because canon changed almost everything they didn't like mark ii . you record both raw jpeg same time , different cards . 2.5 " lcd magnified any point , check sharpness , there definite absence noise shadowed areas you not pair this lense get excellent photos . aside my lenses , i use 50mm 1.4 , 70-300 85mm 1.8 excellent image quality across board . i am small woman found camera weight takes some time get used . however , camera itself so fast it compensated any camera shake i might , due weight , it speed . , now i am used it , i hardly notice it . multitude control buttons confusing , but if you used 1d mark ii , it not difficult switch . if you used rebel xt , keep manual handy your first few times out . whether you shoot jpeg or raw , photos manipulate well photoshop you don't lose any quality ( my opinion ) not 12 megapixels 5d ( which 1 only 2 reasons why i considered 5d ) . large enlargments ( 16x20 ) print up quite excellently again , you speed never miss shot . i've found shooting portraits difficult shoot subjects ( children , pets , someone who doesn't want sit portrait but his wife making him ... ) , speed matter often it saved me failed shoot ! 1.3 fov crop factor ( vs . full frame 5d ) definitely factor weighed . frankly , i use 17-40l get excellent landscape photos . wide ( 22mm ) i could ever wish , not get " fish-eye " . so , i don't find crop factor personal issue but it something i take into consideration my choice . while it limits my 24-70l my 24-105l only 31.2 mm wide angle , it gives my 70-300 " just enough " extra zoom boost ( 390mm ) i don't buy yet expensive lens . i've trying think negatives this camera , order give balanced review . i said , initially weight issue well learning controls . both quickly overcome . cost definitely factor , but especially anyone who this living , it definitely worth $ . i like everything this camera ( i've gone through several others get here ) . when i don't it me , find myself my a620 ( my " purse " emergency camera ) i get so frustrated a620 won't anything even close what i've now come expect standard all cameras . so i guess that one downside , because it large slr , i don't carry it absolutely ( though almost ! ) everywhere . however , overall , unless you want pay close $7k ds extra megapixels , i don't believe there better camera market . i realize while this review doesn't cover all technical specs ( you get either cnet.com or the-digital-picture.com ) i hope it helps someone like me who really difficult time making ultimate decision	1
someone make sense this me please ? """ smaller maximum aperture , smaller lighter lens . """ wtf ? anyway ... it affordable range those us real world explore . it gets 4 stars price vs usability joe soaps jane like me out there	1
i developed dimple my right retina places blur center my field view . i am right handed so my right eye my " sighting eye " . this device gives me clearance use my left eye focus compose my shots . i love it	1
i purchased this extender so i could more comfortable looking through viewfinder . 5/8ths inch doesn't seem like big difference , but it enough put some space your face camera . your face pressed against camera good thing , it helps stabilize camera reducing camera shake . however i find 20d very uncomfortable without extender . my discomfort comes more how eyepiece cushion rests eye not so much smashed nose . extender doesn't prevent camera pressing against my nose , although it clearly doesn't press much . my face still contact back camera . eyepiece cushion feels more comfortable pressed against eye extender place . install , you remove eyepiece cushion camera , slip extender then reattach eyepiece cushion extender . extender reduce magnification viewfinder , but not enough issue me . extenders purchased your eye glass prescription strength mind so one doesn't need wear their glasses when using camera . this particular extender not correct vision . this extender stays my camera all times . pros : gives your nose some breathing room . adds comfortcons : reduces magnification viewfinder	1
this great lens any user , professional or amateur . this lens offers incredibly wide focal lengths all while giving very impressive/clean results . slight distortion noticeable when shooting 10mm ( 16mm cropped ) but this easily correctable software . addition , very fast absolutely silent usm huge plus . i highly recommend this lens anyone wanting great landscapes or great door/architecture shots ( especially realtors )	1
i highly recommend this super wide angle lens anyone wanting take landscape pictures , buildings or lots other stuff ! it so different than standard kit lens ( 18-55 ) . you won't sorry when you start learning all possibilities extraordinary lens	1

i bought 250d lens use my sony dsc-f717 it just wonderful . i also use it my canon g3 because i bought canon ladc58b conversion lens adapter ( which required inexpensive ) . i hearing lot good things this lens digital photography forums i seen many wonderful examples its use . i recommend this lens anyone who wants make their " macro " photography shine . get one ! just clear there 52mm 58mm don't confused which one fit your camera . edit : just clarification : this one ' ' " 58mm " even though above ( this page ) when you click links " see more technical details " " see all product description " it mentions " 52mm " . this misleading confusing . very very top this page it says " 58mm " . let me just assure you this particular one ' ' " 58mm " ' not ' " 52mm " . late edit ( aug 04 , 06 ): well , it looks if amazon finally corrected misleading info i mentioned just above my clarification	1
i shoot canon 20d used canon ef 28-135mm f/ 3.5 - 5.6 usm lens my wide angle option . when preparing extended stay budapest , i decided it time invest faster , better quality wa lens . i reviewed lens lineup canon website decided canon ef 16-35mm f/ 2.8 . lens owner , i confident this lens would great addition my lens lineup . lens , this serious lens meant serious photographers . sturdy construction consists three aspherical elements canon ud glass which largely eliminate secondary spectrum . weather-resistant construction lens mount , zoom focus rings switch panel helps protect lens elements . this lens not compatible 1.4 ii 2x ii extenders . canon ef 16-35mm f/ 2.8 lens weighs 1.3 lbs/600g , accepts 77mm filters or holds gel filters . sure get good quality uv haze filter protect front lens element . not only i see this good practice , canon recommends doing so their site well . focus type standard twist zoom , permits auto or manual focus depending how switch set . addition , lens usm drive mechanism optimum af performance . included this lens front rear lens caps , lens hood , soft storage case , us one year warranty . case pull string soft case ( lz1319 ) also purchased separately . lens hood ( ew-83e ) used reduce lens flare protect front element certain situations . i admit i disappointed this lens while budapest . i found wide angle scenes focused subject distance , images soft . this precisely type images i wanted use this lens . just because this fast lens , it doesn't mean i shoot everything f/ 2.8 either some may claim . i good understanding exposure know how use aperture setting my advantage . it didn't matter what aperture i used , distant subjects soft my eyes . i wondered if lens needed adjusting or calibrating after hearing all great things people say . i lent lens friend who loved quality sharpness while taking close up shots . i then began wonder if i doing something wrong . after testing lens , i've concluded this not lens distant wide angle shots like suggested canon website . when subject matter much closer , like other side room or several feet away , this awesomely sharp lens . canon ef 16-35mm f/ 2.8 lens too different compare canon ef 28-135mm . clarity sharpness incredible close-up shots , auto-focus quiet quick . even though this lens didn't fit my original purpose , it found place my lens collection . i don't foresee this lens one my most used options though . canon ef 16-35mm f/ 2.8 comes price , but it worth every penny when used its strengths . pros : incredible clarity sharpness close-up shotsquiet quick auto-focus cons : heavy bulky ( this should expected these types lenses)distant subjects come out soft	1

fisheye lens lot fun , i enjoy using mine . however , i find practicality lens minimal . i don't usually want my " serious " photographs fisheye distortion . i don't tend like 1.6 crop canon lower-end digital slr cameras , but fisheye this interesting benefit : it reasonably easy use fisheye standard wide-angle lens , since most distortion removed 1.6 crop . you still get distortion , but it lot easier compose shot without it using 1.6 camera than full-frame camera . either way , lots fun . buy one enjoyment , or even professional assignments if your work calls it , but think if you really want distortion before getting one these	1
excellent performance , reasonable price . highly recomend this product	1

i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1

quick , compact , light brilliant pictures but lacking veiw finder " anti-shake " syste	1
never ending race larger larger megapixel counts , d70s fallen behind pack . ( however , if that only measure which you're judging digital camera - you really should consider further research before plunking down several hundred dollars . ) nevertheless , it quite good camera . what i like it most : - it looks feels solid . some reviewers pan this camera feeling flimsy plasticky apparently still stuck realm pro cameras cost several thousand dollars . it not bulletproof titanium box you back hummer over , but it certainly seems outdo dslrs it category . - very good battery life . - backwards compatibility decade worth nikon slr lenses . my gripes : - latch keeps pop-up flash place broke less than week . - inability meter through older manual focus lenses . - lack full functionality flashes other than sb-600 sb-800 . - nikon raw software control software aren't included camera , imho overpriced . ( ... top , nikon split what used one overpriced software package into two overpriced software packages ... ) what would improve this camera most : - iso 100 iso 3200+ - ability store multiple custom white balance presets , then pull them up fly . - replacing " idiot modes " ( i.e. " portrait " , " landscape " , etc . ) modes you could customize	1
excellent camera kit . versatile . i lot learn camera , though , it no simple point-and-shoot . however , auto mode , it takes great point-and-shoot pictures . i look forward learning how use it fully . lenses came warranty cards , but camera itself not . i bought sb-600 flash well battery two 1 gb compact flash cards round out kit . camera lens attached large , which i underestimated . $80 camera bag too small it all . great camera , though . price best i could find anywhere	1
this filter fine normal shooting , but if you low-light work , beware ; you see bad internal reflections night shots , need remove filter	1
great product people want more out their digital camera . not so easy operate beginning , but learning quick results extremely satisfying . little dedication , you able manipulate secrets high end photography . best buy buck	1
i spent lot time reading reviews posts , finally i bought it , it best camera i used , i went old konica 35mm film camera sony cybershot 2 mp then not camera while later i kodak p850 ( great camera also , but slow my taste ) finally this s9000 , belive me this great choice it only camera i found positivly compared dlsr still prosumer camera , tells lo t.t he lack picture stabilization not big deal , it anti blur mode which almost same , full array controls manual settings help please amateurs not so ameteurs . it also first steps os face detection it multifocus mode , which focuses most times subjects faces where ever they frame ( not necesary centered ) , i mention it its limitations you know how compose your sho t.t he user guide easy read , understand follow , you don't know nothing photografy this manul you use most functions few hours easy . summary : 5 5 !!! nice camera	1
good price 9mp camera 10x zoom . image quality good . i'm still shooting mainly 3mp 5mp good results . spot metering works really well , especially while shooting bright day objects sitting under umbrella . macro works nicely . i still yet find good use super macro . camera recycles shots pretty quick . anti-blur mode ( using higher iso rate ) works well . controls/menu make sense . although i wish memory switch feature not buried too deep menu . that good feature . you 2 memory cards camera xd so cheap . you combined capacity instead buy bigger more expensive card . i especially like how menu displayed even inside viewfinder ( it exact copy lcd ) . way , i don't take my eyes off my object while cycling through menu . i wish battery life could better . effort conserve battery power , i shoot mainly using viewfinder avoid using flash using anti-blur mode . but bright side , one just carry more high-capacity , rechargeable aa . it just takes while get used battery consumption rate . i carry 2 sets backups where third one alkaline	1
i am pleased this camera . its pretty easy use . i virtually no camera experience , save breaking them . this camera easy operate pretty fun fool around . i used aperture setting several times get different focus points pics . instructions easy comprehend . i taken quite bit sports photos i noticed its extremely difficult get shots inside gymnasium . shots usually very blurry color just isn't right most time . fluorescent modes camera helpful , but not fix problem . it could just me though	1
it seems surprising canon would make product out anything but best materials . lensmate makes superior product out aluminum black silver	1
black this same my camera , all parts together , this one professional looking set up ! i am not sure if this hood cuts down glare/reflection , i not used it sunny day , but i don't see why it shouldn't . cheap this little product , it pretty much must this camera ! ( s3 ) one last side note , should you alreay own extra lens or two . they happen metal , very carful screwing them into this plastic adaptor ! i made mistake put whole thing fridge hour , so metal would shrink , i could get pieces apart	1
it great camera . it small size , good optical zoom excellent quality . i love it too much i take it anywhere carrying it it nikon small case	1
i am not photographer , but pictures i take look great . it feels great know i capture memories vivid color too . ( that setting i always use . ) other hand though , there long wait time use camera again after picture taken using camera flash . i don't quite know why but it seems if you take many pictures quick succession then using cameras flash not best way go ! all all , price i paid quality quite suitable . if you don't any experience photography , buy this one	1
i bought this camera my sister , early christmas present , thinking i would need some time set it up her , well less then 30 minutes i ready , it awesome camera , i impressed , ease set up formatting 512 sd card . i sent site sister whom interested . it easiest camera use features impress anyone , great photos very close far away . i would recommend this camera anyone	1
item exactly expected . packaging shipment , other item i ordered , unacceptable . child could better	1
i'm using this hood canon ef-s 10-22mm lens 20d . it bit shocking how big this hood until you realize it really necessary very wide field view . canon 20d , lens equivalent ef 16-35mm 2.8 , only it 3.5 - 4.5 . bottom line it trick made same good quality rest canon stuff	1
money , you absolutely can't beat this lens . it very fast sharp . not fast focus , but what you expect $70 ? i four lenses , some costing 4x much this one ... yet i use this one most . anyone looking step up kit lens , or anyone looking buy camera body w/out kits lens should look buy this lens	1
awesome lens , especially price . it very fast 50mm even 1.6 mag my rebel xt easily manageable	1
other day i used friend standard digital camera little while . whole time i found myself missing manual zoom , instant response convient manual buttons my d50 . this camera takes amazing pictures . dslr beginner i used camera auto mode first several weeks , now after reading some books photography i'm slowing starting use manual features . d50 lets me choose level control i'm comfortable , full manual full automatic ; both options just turn dial away . body this camera built like tank . metal high quality plastics abound . buttons provide good feedback switches feel solid durable . it beautiful piece precision engineering	1
not much add other positive reviews posted , other than i am user loves my d50 . it year now shot over 10,000 photos excellent results ( mostly landscape wildlife ) . excellent image quality hand grip fits perfectly both my hand my husbands . only con i think this time there no backlight top panel - this makes it difficult adjust settings low/ no light situations . also , people used little compact point shoot cameras this might seem little overwhelming first bulky carry around ( which why i little pocket camera my purse ) . i also got 18-200 lens love it - perfect walk around lens	1
i used 1.4 ii extender over year . it gives me amazing detail my 70-200l f/4 lens 20d . i use it mostly wildlife butterflies . contrast good colors pop . when shooting sunny day shutter speeds still quick f/ 5.6 background blurred beautifully . shade areas low light tripod must ! there hasn't any sacrifice subject detail . i see individual hairs butterfly bodies even when shooting wide open . this great way get closer without paying significant amount supertelephoto lens	1
my mom i each one these cameras . neither , one us any problems until recently . i dropped mine while taking pictures timer . drop my tile floor smashed telescoping lens out alignment wouldn't close gave e8 error screen . i contacted canon us website then , i sent it into canon repair center il . it cost $87 it repaired shipped back . it took week half it returned me . only thing i would improve this camera speed , i trouble taking pictures my son merry go round(but it could i need change settings ) . it many features it accessories add . since , i am learning more digital photography this great little starter camera many features canon known . also recently i've looking some newer canon models , their casing/ bodies look/feel really cheap me . it may make them lighter but it makes me really afraid i would break them	1
typically fine original design canon . i " chinese " copy - it really - it works but it not same mfr own .	1
this camera pretty good , it very fast , photo quality excellent , video recording mode awesome , perfect carry everywhere since it pretty small , but after several months normal use , metal case begins look pretty rusted , that why i dont give this camera 5 star rating . but check flickr photos , you see examples great photo quality camera	1
i needed lens hood my 50mm lens paying $25 hood $75 lens might seem ridiculous . however , might because $75 lens so inexpensive . if lens $250 then paying extra 10% might not seem too bad . i just saw total cost lens hood $100 that good terrific prime lens its hood . however , please note : lens hood rather shallow ( 1 star reduction ) it screw-on two piece kit ( 1 star reduction ) . one piece adaptor screws-on where filters normally go ( uv filter ) front lens intended permanent integral part lens second piece hood snaps off this adaptor . adaptor ring retains same 52mm rim size so your protective filter go before or after adaptor . ( 1 bonus star ) because $100 still bargain 50mm , 1.8 , super fast , super sharp , super clear , light weight beginner lens hood kit ! i hope this helps rather than confuse . :)	1
first off this very nice lens money . i mine now three months love it . it great walk around lens 28-135 just right most pictures kids landscape pictures . it fast focus sharp clear pictures clear up 125 range gets little soft 135 but easily fixed little post editing . i taken most my pictures hand held works great . i even recommended it friend . i am using it 30d it spends most its time there . i am not sorry i purchased this lens taking lot more pictures it future .	1
this great lens used almost everything . it great if you only want take one lens you . pictures very sharp color good	1
this cheap lens - old design , very plastic - prove terribly useful those budget who want wider perspective , especially 1.6 crop factor dslrs . i learned " cheap " this lens - broke focus ring day after delivery . but i blame myself too , replacement given me no trouble , though i think my first one bit sharper than second . many standards , this lens match or exceed zoom lens comparable price ( prime lens should ) . autofocus little buzzy , but main time you'll notice when it loses its bearing suddenly lurches way off target . mostly , focuses quickly enough well . some chromatic aberration worst-case scenarios , but nothing awful or unexpected . vignetting , even 1.6 crop , noticeable , mainly sky shots , but gradual rather than sudden . ( might unacceptably worse full-frame camera . ) undue distortion seems minimal - haven't really checked but also haven't really noticed , if you see what i mean . flare seems average , perhaps better than one would expect such wide glass . bokeh nonchalant , not dreamy but never intrusive . but price , positives make up negative " average " tendencies . it vibrantly colorful contrasty almost fault . hard light little more challenging this lens , little more tricky balance exposure highlights shadows . it softish wide-open , but very unobjectionably - yet regret shooting f/ 2.8 . my main lens 50mm f/ 1.4 , switching back forth same aperture setting perfectly functional practice . lose little crisp taking four times much space , that trade-off i run . ( their filter threads match too . ) f/4 higher , i get " plenty sharp , " though i've never seen " unreal sharp " this glass ( i 50mm ) . " crop factor " over-simplifies effect mounting wide-angle lens 1.6 camera . yes , field view match 40mm full-frame , but perspective not , because you'll closer your subjects . shooting live subjects ( like bands , models , or street life ) require learning curve , so beware mission critical work before you've broken yourself so you anticipate its exagerations . said , i bought this lens primarily " head-to-toe " model shooting my modest studio , it real asset . interestingly , it tends toward very useful " slimming effect " makes hippy girls look more slender shorter girls more ambiguous height ( least " head-to-toe " distance them ) . disconcerting first but terribly useful once you've gotten hang it . ( beware chicken legs or reverse dramatic perspectives . ) i read every review i could find before purchase , this lens seemed magic middle higher cost clarity 20mm cheaper lesser sharpness 28mm . near i tell , i nailed it . this not spectacular lens , but very very functional one if you need affordable wider angle generally won't let you down	1
if you've bought sd550 , this great addition , case saved my camera couple times already scratches dings ( especially little kids around ) , extra camera chord long durable ( coated metal link chain ) extra battery course invaluable . i'd give it 5 stars , if i didn't feel these items should come standard camera . :	1
i working major daily newspaper baltimore 2 decades . perhaps qualify me expert photography . i shooting digital imagery since late 1990s . maybe qualifies me expert digital photography . this may long- winded , but it extensive useful . i received nikon d2h camera -- 2 bodies total -- over one year ago . i think i got them shortly after d2h system released 2003 . since then , i used them shoot images all types -- documentary , sports , daytime , available light , flash , dead- of- night -- paper i work . this only camera i work . first , please read manual . there ton information there , information terrific begin . d2h highly- configurable , screen after screen you set your own specific use ( resist lending camera anyone long period time , your camera may returned many your settings changed so much it acts like thoroughly different camera ) . i'll just punch right way it feels . camera rather heavy beast , some , there amount shoulder or neck fatigue when using it hours per day , like i . but camera feels well hand controls easy move through . i've long since given up using any camera bag . all i fanny pack 14mm , 55mm , teleconverters 2 extra camera batteries flashes clipped its belt . d2h hold 17-35mm nikon 80-200mm nikon one- touch or sigma 120-300mm 2- touch . shooting breeze . batteries let you shoot long before need recharge . i my d2h set iso 200 or 400 most time sacrifice shutter speed lower iso often i , because higher isos bring digital noise loss color saturation . just today , i purchased digital noise plug ins photoshop limit this , that wonderful thing invest this camera when you must shoot action photography no flash iso 800 above . i now little problems capturing images even barely- limited lighting . i recently shot stars plane wing my seat airbus 36,000 feet over pacific 30 seconds wide open @ f/ 2.8 , it looks tons better than night shots via d1h , which lacked internal digital noise filter . filter kicks around 1/2 second longer exposures , make you wait long your image you've shot strip your long exposure much digital noise . when you shoot this way ( general ) , don't simply react cranking up iso because you not happy your results . camera loud . over 7 frames per second , it make you obvious quiet room . shooting sensitive situations testy , so limit your shooting single frames . i wish this camera option silence this camera , but since mirror raise lower , there no chance this . am i happy d2h ? definitely , yes . there improvements made ? yes . but benefits outweigh drawbacks . people bailing out using nikon system going canon , which some incredible gear , i won't deny . but instead simply giving up your system equipment , learn how use d2h well you'll much happier than ever . means you should push its qualities max while respecting its limitations . instance , white balance . this best thing you , or worst thing you've ever dealt , depending upon how you approach it . daylight , grey skies , dusk dawn easy , because you set camera daylight , flash , shadow ( dusk dawn times ) even fluorescent incandescent tend right ballpark . but horrible mixed light or street lamps glow blue/green or orange- red mercury vapor death image if you don't properly use white balance . preset white balance king , here . i get grey , black white when i preset mercury vapor light . i used preset any light auto white balance setting can't figure . there also setting dial kelvin temps well ! if you this ( i go miles here ) , you're your way . so , trying this d2h , or considering it , read through some digital d2h forums ignore posts slam camera without giving instances . generally , those who pan camera not tried understand it . i bang off images disprove where they suggest this camera fail . when you decent light , you'll decent image . but when you try use it without learning how you maximize system , you come shooting images terrible unprintable . closing , i not paid anyone , i no nikon stock no outside interest writing this except i'm giving d2h credit where it long overdue	1
now i this my camera while now , my camera feels so weird it off , i love grip it gives extra battery life great those all day shooting events i go . i wish buttons same plastic/chrome color ones camera but its well built product works fine so i cant complain	1
neccesary add cannon rebel . good product . too bad it doesn't come camera	1
if you're serious photography , get this accessory . second battery , i get plenty juice any event ( even my zoom lens using image stabilization ) . gives solid grip taking vertical ( portrait ) pictures while still access controls you need . i can't imagine without it now ( spite additional weight ) .	1
i am so pleased this camera ! there really nothing negative i think say it ! i also own cannon xt . i use both wedding photography well family portraits i am so impressed color quality d30 ! well cannon	1
those who truly know digital cameras , more than perhaps 8 megapixels important only if you plan blowing your images up " poster size " , or if you pro who knows how use all those pixels . truthfully , how many you really plan type stuff ? say rebel xti better than 30d because it " more megapixels " " smaller " not best advice . any canon dslr going give you great images , if know how use it . those you who trying decide which camera buy , you really need go camera store ask handle each camera . while you're it , ask yourself how it feels your hands . it too bulky ? it too small hard handle ? it features you want such spot metering , which rebel xti not ? 30d terrific dslr . it all features 99% us need . there reason why it costs more than rebel . 30d better camera overall .	1
this lens wonderful starter lens . professional might want little upgrade , but this just right someone starting out .	1
my 6 year old boys each got camera christmas . they so excited sooo much fun taking pictures . we went download pictures they weren't camera . i figured boys deleted pictures mistake , so i took pictures immediately tried download them still got message there no pictures camera . i didn't expect great quality pictures , but i expect my kids would've gotten see pitcures they took ! what piece junk ! my boys so dissappointed . cameras both trash .... what waste money . not buy this camera if you actually want pictures .	-1
this original battery my camera . if fits perfectly unlike clone battery i purchased elsewhere . i think digital camera , always buy original battery . go real deal .	1
digital picture frames must one hottest christmas gifts 2006 i couldn't find one anywhere give iou . just purchased received philips frame , it well worth wait	1

i purchased dc dxg-301v digital video recorder my son who graduating this year high school he thought it would fun record his last few months his friends . it easy use very compact if you're like me , if your child happy then you're happy	1
i no complaints . i this camera over year half it reliable , fast , gives me crisp , quality photos ! only option i wish this camera better stabilization mode prevent blurred pictures , but software edits blur without reducing quality . blurry pictures not problem long you know how aim shoot . everyone loves playing my camera because it many cool features make your photos fun ! i highly recommend this camera ( especially beginners or those who just want simple camera capture those precious moments , high quality photos ) . excellent camera overall ! ;	1
first off , this camera simple use , very convenient size ( size fat ipod ) . video quality pretty decent , i use it upload youtube myspace videos . i would recommend it just , if you're looking uploading videos internet . videos saved really easily ( usb port directly unit so handy ) edited/spliced microsoft movie maker . ( using this program also cuts mb size considerably ! )my only complaint so-called 30 minute recording capability . i 3 minute video my card it said i only 21 minutes left recording . after i filled card i noticed i not full 30 minutes , maybe 18-20 . oh , audio bit funky side , mainly because it tends give lisp any ' ch ' ' ' sounds . look this camera up youtube see examples	1
we love this camcorder ! we bought it because our other bulky , digital video uses tapes , which we would copy onto vhs/dvd , stopped working . we didn't want spend lot money . we loved idea it easier carry my purse you could download it straight computer or burn it ( which very simple , you not download any software . ) i admit i little reluctant quality picture would less than great , only 60 minutes concerned me , but pictures great i haven't ran out time yet . we used this indoors , outdoors no problems . we recorded our son basketball games it worked great . we read where batteries didn't last very long , but we using rechargeable batteries impressed lifetime they . this must those who children or grandchildren	1
this bag light small but it very convenient if you just carry video camera memory stick . i definitely enjoy it	1
this case really handy appropriate camcorders , used it new york this summer not bulky , however it won't hold any accessorie	1
this carrying case ideal carrying your dcrhc/42 all your family events . it fits great around your shoulder , uses little space , enhances maneuverability all your basic equipment when body movement . fact , i two cases : bigger one storing all accessories this one take wherever i go . it very comfortable , more importantly , keeps your handycam very secure . light gray color nice . my wife loves it . me , too	1
i actually purchased 2 these christmas presents . i gave one pair my son " early christmas " gathering my husband so enthused quality , i ordered pair him .... received them before christmas ! per my husband : " very good quality ... compact so they take up very little room glove box my car !	1
used this trip hawaii - brought lava much closer ( looked great night ) . it not difficult focus , provides clear images . i not disappointed least . compact size makes it pocketable - perfect any traveler/casual user . recommende	1
i got this battery my kodak digital camera . i use camera least 5 times week , recharge battery least once day -i doing this over 2 years . battery definitely losing it charge now -it only stays charged 100 photos ( which good anyway ) ... but battery instructions say it last 1000 charges i far , far more than out it , it excellent value money	1
this my 2nd digtial slr . film days , i using nikon products . my initial foray into digital photography , i switched canon ( 10d ) just see what other side fence . after three years , i switched back nikon because nikon products suits me better . no , this not " canon sucks , nikon rules " review . one thing i learned digital photography you should really decide not camera body itself , but whole lineup ... including lenses accessories . me , nikon lens line-up works me better , not because canon worse line-up ... i'm sure lot photographers find canon line-up much more sensible . now , camera itself : i've own this camera over year sold number stock images using this camera . suffice say , i'm very satisfied its performance ; i'm not going re-iterate praises that said previous reviews . what i am compelled say not-so-great characteristics this camera : iso400 above , it not very forgiving underexposure . if you not nail exposure , even raw you see noise shadow area when you try correct exposure raw software converter . this why you hear lot whining d200 owners regarding " noise . " most them don't nail exposure first time try adjust raw converter ... then bam ! noise shadows . auto white balance becomes iffy well underexposure ; everything becomes biased magenta underexposure ; this very hard correct even post-processing . nikon creative lighting system i believe feature makes nikon little better than canon artificial lighting exposure . basically , nikon designed their flash system multiple flashes mind . nikon auto-focus engine better than most canon folks tend evangelize . afs lenses i'm positive it fast any canons . if there one thing i would like change future iterations this product : i need more than one cross-type af points ! newer pentax dslr nine out its 11 af points ! this beneficial more accurate focus . so my recommendation ... if you already nikon lenses , thinking if it worth price difference jump d40/d50/d70 . it unequivocably " yes . " if you're just starting dslr system , i say look closely what nikon/canon/pentax/olympus/leica/sigma offer whole system then decide . if you decide nikon , you won't yearning own higher d2-series model this camera ; it almost same feature set lower price	1
ergonomics : perfect . d200 not completely rubber-encased . there rubber where your hands need hold it , plastic where your hands rarely touch it . hand grip comfortable nicely concave where tips your fingers dig . battery door memory card door made plastic , hinge-pinned . simple slide latch opens battery door .... some warned latch could easily ( accidentally ) tripped . memory card door latch , however , uses more secure 45 degree pivoting latch . usb 2 video out/dc-in doors made flexible rubber , these doors extend into body camera hinges themselves . english language operating manual work art . each operating concept alpha ' numerically numbered pictoral diagram , page where function explained perfect english . reader quickly catch how this well thought out manual organized . i like depth field preview , mirror lock-up , multiple-exposure capability . continuous servo autofocus better job than any human following focusing any moving object . if you old manual-focus , film-based nikon slr lenses ' 70 ' 80 , except few rare exceptions , fit d200 . all these positive attributes remind me best , most highly-evolved film camera slr . no wonder so many photographers won over digital media .	1
my first professional digital slr nikon d1x . i got great pictures it but it too large heavy lug around extended periods . i also some issues its operation . but now , nikon seems solved my issues d200 . i purchased dedicated sb-800 flash 18-200 lens recommended d200 manual . whole system much improved over my other digital slr . both focus metering seem work more reliably . it works better available light . optical anti-vibration aids overall picture sharpness ( plus those us who not rock-steady ) . i am getting use button sequence required enlarge picture preview really like amount magnification possible . menuing system seems quite extensive well-organized . i would like more latitude picture quality settings ( e.g. contract , saturation , sharpness ) . help screens really tell me something when i'm confused . i appreciate " modeling " feature . it useful when attempting compose dark situation . it also lets me see reflections before they committed picture . unfortunately this feature not work using built-in flash . i wish nikon could add some type lock continuous-single-manual focus selector front camera . my finger seems move switch unknowingly . i would appreciate battery charger built plug rather than detachable cord . person who still wears thick glasses , i wish nikon could make viewfinder more like one their old n8008 . or maybe it time away pentaprisoms mechanical mirrors give us truly pro camera mimics high-end pro-sumer models electronic viewfinders adjustable view screens	1
i am very pleased this camera . i especially like light meter tells you how many apertures you away correct exposure . i am using this my photo class easy use	1
snorkeling trip we used this camera both out water , results terrific . it produced some hysterical pictures my husband i underwater ! fish turned out well , coral . we looked like dorks ! it fun easy use	1
i purchassed this camera my first ever snorkling trip when i went bahama cruise . overall , i very pleased . pictures came out clear camera easy use even under water . only issue i it almost end roll film turn wheel jammed ceased work . i lost last two pictures . i'm not sure if it defect camera , or if i over zealous turning wheel my excitment event . considering quality developed pictures , i would certainly try this camera again .	1
like others i compared it scuba diving trip kodak max sport this one few advantages : 1 . film winded greater depth . 2 . pictures came out clearer - not grainy better colors . don't expect too much it depths below 8 meters since light won't enough ( i used it bright summer day red sea ) . even shallower depths colors turn blue/green without use flash . i taken it down depth 35 meters camera fine , but wouldn't take pictures depths below 20 meters . pictures i took shallow depth came out excellent	1

) . instruction book impressive camera itself . not design but its volume it all english . i still haven't managed digest but few sections . video quality excellent our purpose . there six different video resolutions variety photo resolutions available easy use menu system . shq tv resolution really stunning when you consider miniscule sized gizmo created it . we took camera key west last week recorded shq web ( 320x240 / 30fps ) resolution ( perfect making videos sharing web ) . every time you start stop recording , new mpeg4 file created sd memory card . using photo function creates high resolution jpeg file . end trip we couple hundred files download onto mac . we currently editing files into movie imovie . smaller video resolution i able get three hours mpeg4 files forty-two high resolution jpeg ( 2816x2112 ) files less than half 2gb sd card . same memory card holds hour half video highest resolution setting ( 640x480 / 30fps minimum compression ) . image stabilization works well enough moderate hand movement but it didn't keep up rough water sailboat around key west . i wish zoom range more field view wide end but it tighter than i expected telephoto end . this not camera long distance tight shots wild animals or beach bunnies . it no tripod mount so telephoto power just long enough image stabilizer cope when hand holding camera steady ground . my hands really too large controls but i found ways adapt . it fits my wife perfectly . ca6 supplied hand strap keep camera tethered your body supply leverage one handed use . i use strap mostly accident prevention use my left hand stabilize camera holding outside frame view screen while delicately mashing controls my fat thumb my right hand . even hand tether attached camera we easily carried camera tether our pockets without any problems i able some incognito filming duval street . relatively large ( very bright ) view screen folded back against camera while recording ( folding view screen back camera while not recording or reviewing shuts camera off ) " shoot hip " filming . small carrying pouch 2 or 4gb high speed sd memory card , i recommend additional battery necessary accessory . tiny battery powers camera video mode hour or so but using built flash photos knocks small cell down hurray . reviewing messing menu also cuts into battery duration . lithium ion battery physically smaller than my cell phone battery recharges less than two hours . use it completely enclosed inside camera . sanyo oem battery easy find web there number less expensive , alternative brands made fit xacti cameras . also , gentle use absorbent lens cloth keep view screen lens window clean . ca6 lacks convenience features would make it larger susceptible problems dirt water . there no ports , jacks or connections outside camera . battery , memory card usb port access located under well designed , seal tight door bottom camera . minimal control panel increases durability but somewhat limits easy access many system features . all adjustments made navigating through menu view screen via use your right thumb tiniest joystick i ever seen . it turned out much easier use than i though it would there provision program favorite settings into some " short-cut " moves control stick . above menu control button starting stopping video recording making photos . half-inch space small ridge separates two controls . exposure / record buttons menu control tiny buttons activate menu system select mode ( puts camera record or playback ) . considerations design purpose aside , i some issues sanyo should consider . camera needs accessory cradle some sort would allow it placed mounting thread . there number features offered camera next too useless unless i innovate some method remotely stabilizing it . gaffers tape works fastening it mounting clamp , monopod or walking staff but i hate putting anything sticky beautiful little frame . while sanyo designs mounting system they should also make remote control . focusing exposure controlled sophisticated , multi-pattern , through-the-lens computer program works well polarizing filter ( i used my sun glasses ) enhanced image quality . so why there no provision thread small diameter filter over round lens window opening ? sound recording quality very good selectable noise filters work better than i expected but i don't see point using up data space stereo sound when separation left right channel microphones few millimeters . i haven't digested all 166 pages instruction book but so far i can't find any provision recording mono sound mode . finally , motor noise zoom lens noticeable low noise situations . even though i seldom use zoom function while recording i realize this common issue small video cameras but it still bugs me . we usually strip away most recorded sound replace it music or dubbing when editing videos anyway . brandishing ca6 crowd attract attention . soon people realize it video camera they it like flies poop . my wife likes attention but i prefer unhampered other people curiosity . sanyo supplies suite video/photo editing dvd burning software pc users . ca6 lacks firewire connectivity live editing macs there no mac compatible software supplied but camera syncs well card reader my mac through usb port downloading files hard drive . any mac owner savvy enough edit video files burn dvd already software accomplish task . camera also possesses surprisingly extensive onboard-editing capability through viewing screen or your television . sanyo supplies cord plugs into usb connection provides composite video stereo sound output your television system where you view edit your video photo files utilizing camera amazing menu array . i no idea battery duration this purpose there no external power input camera ( battery external charging cradle ) . aware lower resolution video file settings look fine computer but they nasty your television . overall camera beautiful , reliable fun use lots features . it tiny , easy hide , fast starting , durable , water dirt resistant . images very good . i am delighted exacti ca6 so far ( when i get it away my wife )	1
there reason why some things cheap , it because they ... ummm ... cheap . bad frame , uneven color glass . polarizing filter aside air bubbles front glass , almost falls apart . screwing unscrewing them pain . if you even little bit serious photography , don't waste your money this set . get yourself least set hoya filters	-1
i bought this camera 6 months ago replace older sony camera no optical zoom . i chose sony because they accept aa batteries ( incredibly convenient those who like take pictures away home ) , because flash powerful enough make pictures taken complete darkness look like they taken during daytime , because my first sony camera very good quality . i immediately fell love s600 , until few weeks ago . least every other time i turned camera , lens wouldn't extend camera would tell me turn power off again . i would then it would work . but past few days , i turn it off several times before lens extend properly , camera makes ugly buzzing sound when zooming out . it seems like motor powers lens wearing out . i only taken 400 pictures this camera ... motor should not wearing out already ! it great camera - if you buy it , make sure keep your receipt so you send it back sony repairs . i didn't keep my receipt now am going buy new camera , but not sony	1
what steal this camera ! just got it mail this week , it proven itself well worth buying . i love pretty much everything it . pictures , even auto mode , crisp detailed . if you like photography side , aperture , shutter , focus settings very comprehensive . i never " real " camera before other than cheap 35mm one , haven't taken any photography classes or learned anything photography . i only read little bit online basics , within 2 days i adjusting settings scene needs wow pictures turned out great . if you interested photography , this definitely camera you . one thing mention , however , sd cards really fast while camera , but once you connect camera pc via usb , pictures take while load order edit ( photoshop ) . i highly recommend fast sd card , like sandisk sd extreme iii . battery life pretty good , even when doing video . videos look sound great , you take pictures while you record video . i looking this camera 2 months finally bought it , it well worth it . if you're fence this or more expensive canon or nikon , i'd go this unless you're super hardcore . 5/5 stars excellent product incredible price .	1
this camera takes great pictures travel outdoors . if you intend take family photo indoors you need large room group shots it 35-420 zoom . said i am very happy this camera it long list functions . software better than some i've seen . camera easy use right out box . make sure you buy memory card . battery ahs very long life but i bought spare so i wouldn't caught without my camera . my only complaint photo load slowly my computer compared other cameras	1
it good camera its price . pictures display little bit dark camera but when its loaded pc it comes out ok	1
i happy receive my camera , fast exactly what i ordered ,,... great shipper ...	1
very good first camera . easy use gives great pictures . highly recommen	1
i purchased this camera my young daugther , after canon i bought her fell apart after 3 weeks post-xmas no good reason . anyway , kodak works nicely enough , big screen view pix back , but tiny viewfinder , if you like use feature , its difficult . pix clear colors true . it takes videos which fun handy-for short shoot , course . price great . all around good camera buck . however , it eat baterries like crazy	1
this good quality lens . i bought it because sony recommended it hdr-hc3 i bought . i thought this would wider shot but i still rate it 5 star because it best quality your going get these types cameras unless you move up bigger cameras bigger " mm " filter size . i recomend sony vcl-sw04 37mm 0.45 wide angle lens even wider shots if you still find one . it made 37mm camera but if you still find one new it come adaptor rings fit your 30mm . it looks like sony doesn't make them anymore so you may just go this one . stick sony lenses these smaller video cameras if you don't want hd quality distorted	1
this must doing any close-up or indoor footage . if using hd 1080 video camera then you notice little blurriness edge frame . if you lot camera motion your video it not too noticeable , it mainly when camera static your eye tend zone it . over all it good product	1
i so happy scared same time . i never used digital camera before my life . guess what ? it so easy !! i give kodak all koodles	1
my only complaint : built-in flashes these cameras limited range . if you're shooting dark room subject 30 feet away , it time upgrade digital slr . otherwise - this great camera	1
this underwater case works just like non-pro hopes it . you get it out box , you put your camera , close lock . you jump water take perfect digital pictures . that it ! you access all functions while you're underwater . it really cool looking . i can't say enough great things this product	1
large camcorder like my sony fx7 this adds nice rear " ballast " balance eight hours taping time ! i use it long shoots small one comes cam short home stuff	1
gift recipient said it great . i can't add any more than	1
i purchased this camera gift after extensive research . recipient ended up buying themselves same camera before i could give it them . lucky me . this great little camera . it great beginner those want camera portable	1
i would recommend this camera sub $200 price range . easy use , multiple settings user friendly controls . i am very happy this camera	1
hd1 wonderful , amazing camera . it small enough you always it you -- i've carried mine months my front pants pocket its protective case , able capture family work stills video would otherwise lost . even if quality not up par , i would something instead nothing . but quality great ! i'll expand quality below . this camera genuinely high definition , more than three times resolution ntsc . this best shown comparing dv image captured firewire ( no ntsc modulation artifacts ) computer monitor , hd1 image transferred its sd card . notice this comparison should favor dv -- but instead , it makes increased resolution hd1 clear . hd televisons monitors already commonplace , video captured less than hd quality not highly valued ( like 8mm , good historical content ) . capturing now hd preserves value your video . this camera fits your pocket ! my bet anyone who thinks video this camera not significantly better than dv looking its output downconverted letterboxed ntsc , probably old tv . hd1 records 720p30 format hour 4gb sd card ( $70 ) . there no transport noise picked up on-board microphones , there no tape transport ! even lens finger noises attenuated intelligent placement microphones back fold-out screen , where unlike other cameras , they pointed subject ! it also external microphone jack , missing other cameras . once camera turned , folding viewfinder puts it standby mode no apparent impact battery life . this way , camera ready go couple seconds after viewfinder opened . mine stays standby , sometimes days uses . battery life very good ( but keep charged spare you , just like you keep second sd memory card ) . still shots this camera good or better than most dedicated still cameras . i would rate it just below sony dsc-t7 . however , hd1 10x optical zoom , which reduces need cropping , thereby preserving resolution . look stills video hd1 steves-[ ... ] ( different steve ) , which blowaway excellent web site comparing cameras . output hd1 not clean output sony hc3 or canon hv10 hdv comcorders , both which capture higher resolution . ironically both use cmos sensors which historically much noisier than ccds like hd1 . i suspect this due better post capture processing , so i'm eager try something like noise ninja or neatimage hd1 output . however , , it easy mix video all three using vegas video ( i'm sure other editors ) , especially when hdv cameras used tripod shots hd1 handheld , more casual shots . course , hv10 hc3 each cost twice hd1 , wonderfully compact they , neither fits your pocke t.t he program jet audio [ ... ] best i've found playing mpeg-4 video directly hd1 sd card pc . even free version great job . two other general purpose digital imaging notes : always make two copies your image files different media before erasing original ! rent some internet space web host somewhere across country ( or world ) copy your image files non-public area your web server space . this costs little $6 / month 150 gb or so somewhere secured , backed up facility . you still use public part space create web site . if there tornado , hurricane , earthquake , fire , etc . your " irreplacable family photos " ( including any old ones you've scanned or reshot your digital camera uploaded ) still safe . i understand this point there folks offering this sort service directly , although typically higher cost . review mentions " drawback " video freezing briefly when still captured while shooting video . other hand , this camera video mode shooting 30 1mp stills each second ! take your pick always get right moment . i mention hd1 genuine high definition video camera / recorder fits your pocket so you always it you ? what outrageous step forward ! i hope you like yours find it useful i mine . aloha , steve	1
it its job good it smart purchase protect your camera lens . it better take chance messing up $6 filter lens than your $500+ camera lens . only thing i didn't like this filter it comes very cheap case won't really protect it storage all . besides its all good	1
this charger excellent charging batterys hour . its great those last minute , i need battery moments . i actually 2 them . we 3 digital cameras i saved alot money :	1
while i don't own this charger ( still considering ) , i felt compelled state what i read elsewhere : individual thought his lenmar charger d.o.a. also . upon closer inspection , he noted thin plastic coverings over " touches " . upon removing them , charger worked ! so , heads up prospective buyers .	1
product works amazingly underwater , what cool thing , especially summer , or use vacations beach	1
good product . feets my needs ( amateur photographer ) . maybe not greatest filter , but good value cheap price you pay	1
this filter excellent brand high quality . exactly what it suppose it last long time . i used this brand filter many years many sizes all my cameras . if you don't one these your camera , you should	1
my sister owns this camera i've used it few times . it takes great pictures , quality pictures clear colors deep beautiful . i love this camera . she never any problems it .	1
i owned this camera over year . there most likely models out more pixels . i like this camera . it easy use optical zoom ensures i keep my resolution . if you take memory card your local drugstore ( or other picture printing store ) you should pleased quality pictures . my untrained eye i not tell difference digital 35mm	1
i love this camera . i bought it my trip paris . i found it very easy use . one feature i didn't realize it video sound . i found very useful . i bought 2gb memory card go camera . one it comes doesn't hold many pictures . software easy install use . not really small enough pocket but still great camera budget	1
this camera exelent camara . it plenty effects , plenty modes , plenty scenery options . image quality 3.2 megapixel , but its quite good . pictures you take without flash end up getting bit blury , where if you take it flash , it comes out exelent . sometimes it takes long time picture get taken out flash , sometimes it happens imediatly . but all these flaws only my version . but if you looking good camera great price , this your best option	1
camcorder fairly easy learn use . recorded video came out very clear crisp . i highly recommend it	1
if you plenty light you amazed shots this camera take . macro shots breathtaking . i haven't best luck low light noticed some vertical banding others noted . i'm not concerned battery life because i always consider second larger battery manditory purchase any camera . i also wouldn't wanted pay inclusion firewire cable which i already own . i highly recomend this take anywhere camera unmatched consumer video quality shooting environments plenty light	1
i forced upgrade our family vhs-c camcorder ( least this story i offered my wife ) because my son science fair project , which involved capturing incoming video ccd video camera coupled microscope , recording capture dv tape . our old vhs-c camcorder didn't any video-in capability , obviously wasn't dv . this unit canon also offered opportunity film high-def . wasn't critical our project , but i figured this where all camcorders going end up , we fill our homes new hd tvs , our landfills old lo-def crt-based tvs . i'm all future-proofing purchase . first problem : no firewire dv cable included camera . if canon include mini-usb cable , what big deal throw firewire cable ? c'mon , canon --- i expect more thousand-dollar camera . second problem : no video capture software included box . time my purchase , there mail-in promo entitled you get free copy pinnacle dv . who knows how many weeks may take arrive . it also required you cut upc off box --- not something i'm happy doing until i'm positive i won't returning camera store picking out different one . if digital cameras include copy adobe photoshop elements box , why can't canon make arrangements put pinnacle box too ? irritating hoop-jumping customer . third : agree other owners provided battery ( lack standalone charger ) also skinflint canon part . honestly , i'm not surprised , since pretty much every camera manufacturer i've ever seen plays let's-make-some-extra-dough-on-worthwhile-accessories game these days . ultimately , it all picture quality , i haven't disappointed this regard . took some family footage break-in camera , showed it our hi-def tv --- terrific . image stabilization worked pretty well . didn't stress camera low-light shooting , so i can't comment . agree others tiny size this camera makes lots itsy-bitsy buttons crowded together , which not everyone like . i'm getting used . now main issue learning all features . it take awhile punch your way through setup menus if you want remove date stamp , step down 1080p lower def , or anything else way configuration . ultimately processes all pretty logical , but camera so many options , expect spend some time wading	1
this really helpful use camcorder without worrying battery life	1
good price here made japan . not void warranty . one i just received amazon.com charged full reasonable time built charger my canon optura 400 . doubles time original , great backup .	1
i began child brownies graduated instamatics , wondering wonderful new technology convenience contained drop roll film cool flash . high school i progressed dark room processing ( whose magic science later served me sweltering subtropical environment ) , but still most basic cameras unless friend lent me his mamiya seikor hand held light meter . i old soviet all mechanical kgb 35 mm slr camera laying around somewhere , but my main camera which became like part me , organ my body , my canon al-1 , wonders rudimentary focus assist system aperture priority photography . canon saw me across thousands miles through nicaragua heights machu picchu , finally gave up ghost when twenty years came went duct tape couldn't hold it together anymore long lens fused body . known photographer , or one who taken pictures , its draw backs , people ask you latest technology . mountains nicaragua eighties new tourists asked me how their latest point shoot knew which iso set . i no idea . more recently people handed me their digital point shoots , tiny cellphones , i no idea lingering commitment roll film true photography , full sized slr only way go . i cannot grasp concept parallax which point shoots require , but must compose viewfinder i cannot control darkroom commercial color film processing . then i met this d-40being obliged buy digital price film processing soared , i searched desperately here amazon , feeling unfaithful , comparing product details , etc . which so generously given here amazon , i discovered : this d-40 all camera you ever need forever , case closed ( course i felt same my canon ) . i now once again sleep my slr literally , its manual i commit memory . this camera really more than you ever need , since it behind latest wave its price very reasonable generous . number megapixels more than sufficient enlargement , cropping details while recomposing . fact , camera its own darkroom , it allows you crop otherwise alter adjust all aspects images , including going sepia tones , dump them printer or your computer , without need further graphics programs . full functions camera quickly become intuitive , its easily accessible ergonomic buttons switches menu screens , one who used no more than mainly mechanical slr years loved it , this d-40 truly magical well beyond my needs , desires imaginings . it everything more . i strongly suggest you get very inexpensive 55-200 mm long lens designed this camera series . watch full description lens sure it fully compatible all this camera features . before going outside , you learned your first photogrpahy class , sure get uv lens filter , or other filter , mainly protect lens scratches world your fingertip oils . sure get semi-soft camera case which ample enough cover surprisingly short long lens . also hunt around best price sd memory cards , which you want several , which very inexpensive here amazon . if you afford it get extra rechargeable battery carry your case , get plug transformer use where plug available long service required . pick up remote control device all rest bells whistles while available , but essentially get long lens , lens filters , sd cards , semi soft case . also get great all around technique refresher book like understanding exposure ( see my review there please ) . one surprisingly expensive accessory speedlight flash attachment . i got sticker shock seeing price these nowadays , one angles , etc . we used get these used next nothing , but now i'd get lens instead ! any case built pop-up flash d-40 serves most any flash situations without annoying red eye assist , etc ., even good distance ( ever seen those folks football game stand up try fill stadium their disposable flash or their cellphone ? or stand more than twelve feet away ? ) . i normally go ambient light no matter how long exposure , suffused effect , so rarely use flash . so i glad learn flash suppressed " fully automatic no flash " mode , well other modes , but it there pop up whenever people require you " take my picture " under unfavorable conditions very comforting . this great all around camera also wonderfully implemented specific skills . only con mentioned elsewhere i agree regarding three point automatic focus system which focusses nearest object . i lean law thirds myself so lock focus recompose viewfinder , or think cropping later . obviously focussing points set up favor exact center , which death any photograph . but hey , work around this already ! you cannot go wrong this camera . i mention ample rear screen , full color , which permits zooming very closely check your focus , etc ., which scrolls through several functional menu screens ? it everything more , including settings aperture priority ( even if you not manual aperture ring your lens , you it through camera itself ) , shutter priority , etc . etc . etc . if you feel there something this camera cannot , mentioned other reviews , just read manual ( we used interesting acronym early days pc ) you discover this camera fact it all more . you set this up so every iota information regarding focal length , shutter speed , aperture , etc ., etc ., gets saved photo instead jotting it down pad , thus you even see iso altered automatically fit conditions . no more blowing off roll 100 iso before nightfall just take low light pictures oil lamp iso 800 using it up before daybreak . you also set iso instead automatically switching it shot shot camera wills . i not yet tried setting iso 1600 see if it comes out ethereally grainy film when first marketted twenty years ago . got some great shots people places way . i suppose dslr it simply grants greater latitude low light situations without flash . but i see no pressing need button dedicated directly only adjusting iso mentioned review . i trust d-40 processor make decision . that what i pay it . me , i am too concerned keeping those kids focus frame , or wild bird spooking soon , or flower getting lost too great depth field , or holding my breath while soaking altar lit candles wishing i brought my tripod , or least monopod . truly this camera get , especially this falling price , but sure protect it lens filters case , read manual !	1
i got this camera ' cause i sick tired compact cameras simply not deliver quality photos . when i first got it i pleasantly surprised , you simply put lens camera took great pictures you ! everything i could only dream compact camera came this beautiful instrument . auto mode perfect everyday use , other modes great messing around getting great photos process . i would definitely recommend this camera anyone who willing step up get their first real camera	1
fun easy use .. this one best dslr beginning photographer ! grand canyon here i come ! oh know this not bracketing lenses super pricey ( new lens must motor built since camera body not one )	1
i bought this my florida trip . it worked perfectly while i doing snorkeling . well this what it . but also , when i use it my air boat ride , it worked well too . i wouldn't say i enjoyed see other camcorders got wet but i happy i my protected . pro : easy using , what it says it . con : needed weight keep unit stable under water . it hard hold it when too close surface while windy	1
i bought these binoculars month ago using it since . this pair all it promises , if not much more . unit solid feel not look cheapy . images 10x crisp but when you go 30x they get tad dull given 25mm lenses ( i wont blame olympus this one since it not fault , just way cut size costs . 50mm way go if you dont mind size ) . i would've given it 5 stars it not zoom-lever ; lever sticks just bit when i zoom max almost giving " grindy " feeling . couple minor desirable features i'd like see added : 1 ) tripod support - if you steady hands you fine but 30x even slightest shakes make image look blurry . 2 ) lens caps - given these babies cost me $80 i'd like see pair caps object lenses . i buy something 50mm objective lenses variable zoom if they came less bulkier	1
this one very nice . you clearly see difference picture without this light . this works great . this must compatible camcorders . i used this hc42 campcorder	1
one word terrific . this not much review you few notes those who thinking buying it , who experience canon minidv camera such gl1 or gl2 ( or any other minidv camcorder ) . i wondered if xh a1 shot sd ( standard dv ) well hdv . it . i went through many articles not finding this called canon . so this means you sell your old model minidv camera ( mine gl1 -- used gl1 fetching $1200 ebay . ) still access , read , upload download your standard 4:3 minidv tapes . not touch lcd display . you actually see it daylight which great . but very careful not touch screen finger . i brushed corner mine got shiny spot . what nice lcd display viewfinder work same time . one very minor but annoying problem manual . would you believe it doesn't tell you how turn it . unlike my gl1 which on/off switch , this power dial . no where manual it tell you , you push tiny button 3 o'clock dial then turn it turn thing . if you need capture footage you shot older canon minidv camera xh a1 realize play your old tape its correct taped forma t.t he camera works well final cut studio . change capturing minidv capturing hdv i just use easystepup final cut that it . i used use soft case my gl1 . this heavier camera i switched hard vanguard vgp-32 . it perfect size this camera sizeable foam tight fit . one big surprise me battery . it goes inside camera , huge last 7 hours . now , i'm still just getting used it , but so far i just love it . p.s. there lot more bells whistles this than my old gl2 , many which not covered manual . instance under lcd screen speaker you use listen audio you've taped ( just like my old gl1 ) . next hole marked reset . reset button not covered manual . my horror speaker suddenly stopped working . speaker not listed index . i get it working again . i went menu set audio setting back default . somehow i changed settings without knowing it . so , keep mind there lot learn here .	1
this camcorder super easy use . we set it take wide screen movies ( 16:9 ) , so when we recording , we simply remove disk place it right into dvd player watch it tv . my kids love instant viewing their movies . this camcorder also allow you take still pictures captured memory stick . this function saves you carrying camera camcorder . we only this camcorder one month , but we took it vacation very happy it .	1
we looked every differnet camera out there this seemed best what we wanted . its small lightweight , very easy use i think digital pictures came out pretty well . pretty decent clarity . we really didn't bring our digital camera us . this seems all one camera . discs also easy use format . we used cnet check out alot actually ordered off amazon next day shipping it still cheaper than best buy . ordered 8 pm it next day noon . overall- great camera	1
this outstanding camera . very easy use pretty good battery life . i picked up sony accessory kit same time even " back up " battery kit lasts 90 minutes full charge . this camera all best available features ( night shot , good image stabilization , functional touch-screen menus , name few ) . video quality lp mode not very good , so don't expect get more than 30 minutes shooting out minidvd . however , sp mode provides really good quality , so you don't worry cutting your time down 20 minutes ( which time you get out one dvd highest quality mode ) . what i'd warn potential buyers dvd camcorders general , rather than any problem camera . someone who not intimately familiar wide variety camcorders ( who tired my panasonic dv camcorder not recording properly ) , i considered minidvd option ideal . however , i learned two things after finishing my first dvd . 1 . you need special software ( dvd video editing software or dvd copy software or both ) anything other than copy one minidvd minidvd . additionally , software like roxio mydvd doesn't work well vob file format used camcorder . all video minidvd saved into single file . this means video editors know how ( patience ) trim down video make different chapters . chapters show up finalized dvd camera , but dvd copy software won't reproduce menu you , either . 2 . if you want play back your videos something other than camcorder , make sure your dvd player relatively new . ours 6 years old didn't recognize dvd-r valid disk . now i know , this seems pretty logical , but when i popped my first disk into my player , expecting see my daughters playing , i sorely disappointed find player wouldn't anything disk . however , there some fairly inexpensive players out there now recognize all dvd formats , so this isn't huge problem . it just something you need aware . all , dvd505 great camera . those seriously interested dvd editing , unless you really know what you're doing , you may want consider sticking dv tapes awhile	1
best part protectors easy apply . no more finger prints or smudges	1
ditto .... lcd cracked no apparent reasonsent it canon illinoisawaiting outcome repairgood overall camera , but no low battery signa	1
my wife i bought this camera 6 months ago upgrade aging kodak 2mb . i am pretty much " automatic settings " guy whereas my wife loves use manual settings , change iso , shutter speed etc . this camera perfect both us picture quality amazing . i somewhat sceptical reading other reviews display cracking but , fingers crossed , not any problems . movie feature very very impressive , highest quality good enough transfer dvd . would advise you get 1gb ultra fast card really benefit cameras features . only complaints software comes camera image editing terribly outdated looks like something used windows 3.1 transfer via cable quite fiddly leaving you wonder if door usb cable socket camera would break over use . we bought universal sd card reader take card out itself then transfer pc . there no battery indicator which ridiculous . suddenly camera says " low battery " then shuts off . get yourself battery spare . whoever left this feature camera canon should fired . download free picasa image software . much better than adobe photo album canon software included box	1
this camera case stylish , compact fun ! aware there not much extra space inside store camera cards , definetely not room extra batteries . there plenty larger camera cases purpose ; this camera case stepping out style	1
bought this go pink camera i bought my 12 yr old daughter xmas . nicely made , protects camera it looks cute !	1
adds so much freedom my regular shooting ... sure makes my job easier able get wider view more creative shots because it . definatelly good investment	1
i went through g-series powershot cameras probably owner one first batch g1s imported . still love them , especially 420ex speedlight mounted top . alas , i needed pocketable digital camera so went a710is . i get excellent pictures it , even auto , several non-photographers i've suggested it amazed how many more excellent shots they get . its good . i two beefs it . pocketable means pocketable : 1 ) need add-on flash because built-in one only good 11 feet instead 18 feet . 2 ) need case because lcd doesn't reverse storage like others canon product line . canon not it quite right yet	1
i several digital cameras , many brands but i must say casio exilim ex-z600bk one best ultra digital cameras market . pros : fast operationbig , bright lcdgreat bodynice picturescons : no viewfinderno manual controlsadditional comments : lookrating : camera looks it online images . its nice dark , glossy black but doesn't smudge or keep finger prints easily . sizerating : 5/5its very tiny . you hide it clasping your hands . feelrating : 5/5its great feel . buttons small but not awkward . its light too . you hardly feel it yout pocket but its balanced comfortable hold . this camera practically perfect . this honest review . its great value money . i recommend it .	1
i chose this casio because price , good sho t-t o-shot speed , most important me charging cradle battery life . i got so tired running out battery middle day . all cameras should charging cradle , just like your cordless telephones	1
i don't think anybody going pretend little casio exilim ex-z600 6.0 mega pixel camera best camera ever built or takes best pictures world . but under $[ ... ] , it hard beat everything advertised . size perfect , one smallest , slimmest cameras made , easily fitting into one [ ... ] pocket , even when enclosed small case . viewing screen probably biggest brightest you'll find , so aiming shooting easy it . range modifications ( size , contrast , sharpness , saturation , etc . ) taking managing pictures seems almost endless , yet various menus camera offers simple navigate . camera docking stand makes downloading pictures one computer well charging up camera snap . moreover , according casio , single charge afford one up 500 or more snaps . picture quality ? it perhaps not absolutely clear well defined , even its maximum six mega pixels , best cameras ; although , fair , best cameras often cost three-to-four times much this one . so , far i'm concerned , i've no complaints , pictures i've taking delight eye . z600 makes picture-taking fun again	1

one obvious unexplainable omission details reviews here dimensions this unit . not including external pocket they approx . 11 " long 4 " deep 8 " tall ( external ) . padding approx . 3/8 " thick . " false bottom " approx . 2-1/2 " tall completely removable . there one spacer top area secure camera large , velcro enclosured , pocket one side . " rattling around " earlier reviewers camera would , i surmise , eliminated proper use adjustment internal camera spacer . external pocket 9-1/2 " long 6 " tall 1-1/4 " deep . it 2 opening pouch one side other zippered net . i bought this case dcr-trv20 . it replacing smaller unit , although it snug fit , allowed inclusion very few our ever growing selection accessories . i am now able comfortably carry charging unit ( under false bottom ) , external light unit , several tapes remote . i could easily fit additional lens if necessary . these obviously bulk cargo plenty room small incidentals various compartments . everything this unit screams h*e*a*v*y d*u*t*y ! heavy grade , woven nylon semi-rigid casing reinforced handle heavy , solid metal zipper pulls , strap clips flap closure . my previous case well built unit held up admirably through four years use . it also cost much this sony case . however , sony case obvious step up craftsmanship quality . top all , my camera my camera bag finally match ! awesome purchase , incredible price . thanks amazon ! ** update**checking back this review , i see reviewers still giving poor review this bag based fact their camera doesn't fit properly . although this valid issue , i feel it gives bag bad rap because bag itself lives up all reasonable expectations . listings amazon providing these camera accessories seems best generous truth , quite often erroneous . regardless where they acquiring their information , it their own writers or sony itself , list cameras each item often inaccurate . example , i purchased external light my camera based list here claiming it would work me . actuality , light specifically designed different battery type than my camera uses would require adapter mount shoe mount different size . additional research showed i needed different light altogether specifically designed my camera . although light " would work " my unit , amount effort added expense required utilize it unacceptable . my point here , although listings here often innacurate , item itself receives bad rap when we give poor reviews based specifically inaccurate listing not actual performance unit . it my belief these reviews should generally reflect actual performance item . if necessary , any experience poor or innaccurate listings should , all means , highlighted . adhering these guidlines , we actually improve descriptions items researching reviews , make much more informed decisions . just my 2 cents issue . also , after busy summer ton use , my case still looks works good new . -d	1
i got this camera love it , except one thing . microphone input jack not work . so i am sending it back i need this external mic . everything else better than expected . this zr500 dropping prices right now , so now good time buy . i now get zr830 only few dollars more than i zr500 . zr500 not usb connector so you'll use firewire , which cost me few extra dollars . zr600 i " believe " usb connection direct your computer so i would say buy zr600	1
this camera takes fantastic photos . it resolution great . waterproof one it greatest assets . i highly reccommend this camera . just get li-42b battery extend time ( approx 2 hrs ) camera provided battery only lasts 20 minutes . i love this camera . using hi-definition printer , it prints photos comparable developing lab	1
i error message my i checked canon website found they recall it , i sent it they fixed it free . check website call provided phone number even if you don't see your problem listed , eventually they might other recalls all complains .	1
color much better than kodak max 400 speed pictures much clearer	1
i purchased this camera before our trip hawaii , not repented ... it delivers clear photos , very flexible set pre-programmed settings ... must purchase folks move	1
i am very pleased this camera .... i yet use it 10 feet under water but maybe someday ... i love compact durability this camera . picture quailty excellent !!! very happy photographer	1
i've this camera two months now i really like it . fact it image stabilization means i yet take blurry picture . also , zoom quite impressive . nifty feature you overlay grid help photo composition(the " rule thirds " ) . only caveat this camera lack optical viewfinder , so you can't really turn off lcd save battery power . i never batteries die out me , so i don't really consider it problem , although you may	1
i got this camera when price it took nosedive . i found i wasn't carrying my powershot s2 around outdoors much because size issue . this one i bring anywhere . picture quality low iso just good best superzoom cameras , leica lens gives very clear rendition any scene . build quality fantastic , solid metal large , bright high resolution screen . focus times decent , par other superzooms . lens hardly extends outward all , folded optics really shrink footprint camera . however ..... shooting indoors or high iso issue entirely . noise big problem above iso 100 . flash pathetically weak . iso 80 , flash only rated around 3 feet ! this not camera indoors or low light . movie mode decent , but nothing write home . widescreen 848x480 mode interesting , but overall quality couple steps down powershot s2 or s3 . sound especially weak comparison . positive note , you zoom during filming . tz line cameras designated " travel " . if you plan using this camera ( well lit outdoors ) , it great choice . all one solution , i can't fully recommend it .	1
camera works great even though it refirbished unit . however it not come complete . it missing adapter ring now out production.buy.com, fuji other locations not ring . my bad buying out date camera sale	1
easy share dock great little device delivering everything promised . my one complaint , albeit minor , entire " easy share " system kodak might wonderful someone new digital photography . it would very useful newbie storing pictures pc hard drive , cd or dvd , but i found software folder stucture contrary way i things . " its way " isn't flexible enough allow me continue various picture tasks my way . after using easyshare download pictures camera via dock , i always move files around suit way i've things several years . dock , i'd recommend it anyone . it nice unit .	1
easy use understand , quality , keeps camera fully charged all time	1
product works well only when used without flash unit . if flash operates it creates shadow finished photo . when used sufficient light without flash unit this lens delivers quality photos	1
useful reconditioning batteries losing their charge .	1
regular batteries caused my camera need repair . independent repairman stressed only use kodak batteries . sometimes it worth it pay name brand	1
i've seen some bad digital frames- ones stretch out picture , making everyone look fat , or dim displays bad color . philips frame absolutely opposite : it delightfully easy use picture quality great . pictures automatically sized , cropped , even rotated when you turn frame . i didn't need software they included . i just dumped pile pictures cf card ( using my camera wired computer ) then plugged card into frame . menus frame navigated little joystick back . it not nicest menu system , but i got hang it pretty quickly . if you buying this grandma ( course ) here tip : buy two memory cards so you switch photo albums when you visit	1
we ordered this product retirment present co-worker who leaving week so we even fed ex shipping . product kept showing up order status never updated until almost week later when it delivered . product arrived excellent condition but we wondering if it ever shipped ... amazon or retailer needs update shipping info instead leaving product showing order status not shipped	1
i wanted small case my new digiital camera , not like those offered fuji . no offense fuji , i just didn't need all bells ans whistles you include . this little case great alternative . it holds my camera , couple memory cards , spare batteries like glove ! there strap back case used belt clip , or i , wrist strap . my only complaint shoulder strap not removable . all all , i am very happy my purchase .	1
i've using this camera few months now , so far i'm very happy my purchase . main factor me deciding camera quality pictures . a430 delivers 4mp . amateur like me , this not seem like much . actually it seems outdated compared other cameras out there . but once photos taken , i amazed clarity resolution . resolution more than enough amateurs/hobbyists (?) . colors vibrant sharp , although there some noise/grains blacks . plus , you record movies ... sound ! quality videos isn't spectacular but gets job ( rather grainy 640 mode [ largest ]); it not something you'd make movie , but perfect places like youtube . i believe you get ~ 15 minutes 1gb 640x480 . so someone who takes pictures just fun , it nearly everything you'd want . pros : great pictures : high-res , vibrant , clear ; good flashgood body constructioneasy use ( low-med learning curve)awesome battery life ( rechargeables)good video feature cameracons : bulky ( much more than it seems ) ( i suggest a500 series when it sale [ slimmer profile])small screenslowdowns when zooming movingthings note : i suggest least 512mb memory . much , you take many pictures you want without feeling constricted . memory really cheap now . brands such sandisk too costly - there much cheaper alternative same size card , same quality ( buy online ) .	1
i this one before it stolen so i replaced it same thing because it just what i needed . great clear shots , user friendly , downloads without problems , feels good hand , small light . if i lose this one i'll buy same one again	1
if you looking point shoot turn out some great photos little effort , go no further . this camera 4x zoom , which hard find this price range , plus enough megapixels good looking 8x10 . there also some neat artsy features like color swap color accent ( everything black white except one specified color .... very fun fool around ) . i am very satisfied this product , use it almost daily . give it try , it not dissapoint	1
although they weren't packed securely -- just loose box -- bushnell falcon binoculars work well served us well . my wife especially enjoyed them huge 92,000 seat stadium university georgia football games . they functioned very well , sharp image no mechanical problems . we enjoyed them very much , i would recommend them others	1
this fixed 10x -- not zoom . didn't realize when i bought ... even so , it works fine price . using this , suburbs , i able see ( albeit faintly ) andromeda galaxy orion nebula . i can't wait try out somewhere countryside ... these useful but course , now i am left wanting more	1
it compact , well designed easy use , plus it charges batteries rapidly - full charge hour or less batteries seem last all day , unless subjected lot flashes	1
support system background paper funcioned expected . plants i photographed beautiful , without background clutter . great value	1
i purchased this camera assuming it would shoot like slr size still makes it packable like point-and-shoot . most part , it . i upgraded older , simpler powershot s400 , hoping get back some manual control my old film slr days . certainly manual aperture shutter speed modes ( which use attractive on-screen display dial ring back body ) very accessible convenient . setting lower than 2.8 would certainly nice , however . what i didn't expect making so much use auto program modes ... silly me , that probably what i paid all $$$ first place . face recognition , advanced metering capability really helped some tricky shooting situations . you wow your friends face tracking screen subject or camera moves ... most noticeable drawback ( this previously mentioned ) high noise tiny ccd 0.01 gigapixels crammed into it . it really pretty bad some situations . very careful not forget leave camera higher iso mode , or pictures ( even daylight ) ruined graininess . true , you'll get some photo higher iso modes you would not gotten otherwise , but result bit disappointment . props go out superb job image stabilization . seems like that where investment really paid off ( me canon ) . steady hand-held position , 1/15 shutter speeds not present problem ( i recommend snapping off couple shots though , just ot sure ) . non-shooting side , options available manage selectively delete pictures stored sd card very good . i especially happy see i could clip videos down desired length right there camera . who wants carry hundred mb video , when all you want 10 seconds that clip ? nice job . strange/annoying feature ( haven't figured out how disable it ) if you zoom image view it , delete it or move onto next image card , camera holds zoom previous level last image . sort odd . battery life fine , compared other camera i've owned . camera this size , it seems like they could worked little harder fit aa into it . overall , i see this camera i going get fine . it fits my old camera pouch i used carry my sd400 around . it shoots awesome pictures daylight , well low light long i my hand steady i don't b*tch too much graininess . prices look like they're starting come down , i'd say it steal $400 if anyone wants wait	1
i rebel xt lenses , flashes , etc . my wife wanted small easy use camera so i got her this her birthday . she got it last night up all night taking pictures around house experimenting wide range options available . first she thought camera too complicated but after staying up all night using it , she living it . professional photographer , this camera great i may steal it events quick way take some pictures . it all features super resolution make great companion ( long she lets me take it ) highly recommended anyon	1
i all sorts research sd600 . i made up my mind sd600 camera me . sd1000 newer kid block therefore not many reviews . why i am here today . sd1000 newest version sd600 few additions . those few additions make this camera awesome . i love iso choices . i zooming my local calif . freeways around 80mph decided take few shots passing signs out my passenger window . high speed iso caught such great detail i could clearly read sign later home . means despite small size camera filtered out shake my hand , shake road , compensated fast movement . color options very much same other canon powershot models . macro so much fun play this camera . button layout easy figure out . lighting options like white balance button push away . face detection option you sure get great photo family . i playing it none stop over week . get least gig memory . only downside i found , it minor one , when battery warning comes it means you 1-2 more pics then it shuts off . i ordered battery ahead time it worth it . batteries charge 30-40mins . this great camera . if you thinking sd600 step up get sd1000 . you not disappointed it	1
i love this camera . it handy , goes my purse everywhere . sure it isn't canon rebel or remotely like it , but it fast fast fast , holds charge , takes great wide angle shot takes superb macros . i don't use movie feature but it it . there lot offer this little camera . i people stop me all time ask what brand it . buy it happy :	1
this my fifth digital camera , i like it best far . it also cheapest . it my first wide-angle my first silver-not-black : someone else said , i don't see how i would ever go back non-wide-angle after this ; but i wish mine black . i noticed colors faded fluorescent light , but macro it excellent -- much better than more expensive camera i already bought macro purposes ( canon . ) i also love battery , which seems last forever . i bought replacement lenmar battery which also great , cheap , but it got some bad reviews because it described wrong model camera , not fx-01 . ( if you read customer reviews , you figure out which one right one you . ) i problems understanding display , which shows options don't correspond any place camera you select options . ( i guess i should look manual . ) also , i don't like software decided not download it all . i bought this because i wanted camera made computer company much camera company , , i wanted it work . also , someone sent me email history leica , how they saved lot jews concentration camps . other nice thing this camera i use it lot more because i carry it me every day : it tiny battery always works , so why not ? graininess , my desktop pics look fine , i would not raving this camera if it not very easy take good pics -- but i admit i haven't used it printed pics so far	1
i've purchased this battery ' cause i usually take hundreds pictures long sports events i needed second battery so i could take all pictures i want . i'm very happy this product ' cause power last hours hours i re-charge it short period time . i've used this one year i'm still satisfied it	1
this got one easiest telescope imager/camera around . this imager goes place eyepiece images instantly appear laptop computer screen . included image processing software very user friendly . driver loads quickly seconds . it very exciting see astro images moon details lunar craters . ccd chip highly sensitive gives you excellent detail even low light conditions . photographic magnification this imager gives you remarkable 150x . i not tried it jupiter but i am certain i won't disappointed . great purchase	1
great camera start off . i didn't get mine amazon , found it cheaper elsewhere , but anyways my parents 5385 so just getting it i knew some stuff ahead time , like it eats batteries , even rechargables(maybe i got some bad batteries who knows ) , best thing i've found solve this energizer squared batteries , they hold up . why doesn't it come power cord ?... way you turn off lcd , all you press ok button back like 2 or 3 times it switches through one them it turns off . most part only real problem i it placement on/off button i'm afraid it might accidentaly get turned but i keep it case provided prevent ... so yeah 5 stars	1
camera great . manual tells you how use it awful . also it didn't come picture card-surprise ! dealer i bought it mailed it out right away price good	1
i got 750 more than 1 year ago love it . i purchased 850 my relative . it also great product	1
product advertised genuine panasonic ; it fully met my expectations performs well	1
product comes 4 aaa batteries which seem work fine . charger itself four places where you charge either aaa or aa batteries . i haven't measured time it takes charge , but 1hour seems right ( according what they claim ) . there two leds which change red ( charging ) green ( finished ) . charger small enough take you if you want , or store away unobtrusively drawer . plug folds into charger when not use approximately size cigarette pack ( little bigger actually ) . i've using this 2 months without any problems	1
this camera takes great pictures all time . i haven't one picture turned out bad . it also very easy use there lots fun things you it . i would recommend this camera anyone	1
i've canon digital cameras past two years my first , opted purchase accompanying canon camera case . though it good fit , it couple flaws caused me look elsewhere case when i got my second digital camera this year . this time around , i chose tamrac case because , unlike canon , it zips closed . canon flap closure creates two big gaps either side case , allowing small particles get inside camera itself . second , tamrac features not only belt loop , like canon , but nice shoulder strap . this means user carry camera hands free without put it purse or backpack . this case fits many small film slim digital cameras ( go tamrac website download spec sheet lists camera/case compatability ) , so don't expect custom fit . my canon a510 , this case bit long side , but no so much so i concerned it shifting around too much case . it good bag great manufacturer decent price . recommended	1
product easy use accurate . it also great buy	1
this camera great . i haven't used wifi component yet ( because you need t-mobile plan ) i've heard all types reviews it . otherwise , camera works great . many complaining flash function but i never problem it . blur reduction could sharper but , its good regardless . i highly recommend this camera . it sleek design works great	1
i've only it week , but i'm already up speed most features . luv touch screen navigation intuitive menus . online manual better than print version . now i'm movie director one easy lesson my own editing pc . take three still photos while recording video ! extra battery	1
i bought camera use trip lake tahoe , nv . scenery beautiful camera so easy operate i got lots wonderful pictures . i would recommend this camera anyone who wants take great pictures without lot problems . it small easy handle	1
birthday party , vacations , casual user , this camera outstanding price . $200 , you get great resolution great color , compact size , usability you need 15 kids running around you party ! you , course , immediately need memory card before using it ( one package serves up 8 pics ! ) sandisk memory cards supercheap , i bought both 1 2 gb version , both which work great ( 2gb hold 1,000 pics ... plenty ) . program your computer little clumsy load , but within 20 minutes i program all my recent pics all loaded into my computer . awesome price , unless you professional photographer looking get published national geographic , you cannot beat value priced a550 7.1 megapixels canon name . fill your family scrapbook under $200 .	1
sorry guy who sent his camera bottom atlantic , but this product great when you read instructions ! camera case shows weight configuration needed make it your camera neutrally bouyant - when tightened it stays great camera not sink . weight kit great addition those who really going use case diving . i 6 dives it great	1
this replacement camera one lost ; it came new feature vibration reduction . my pictures come out much better - especially those taken moving vehicles ( think vacation pictures ) . i also found close-up feature much improved . quite surprise	1
it every thing , loaded features ( manual setting hard ) . slightly big size , not user freindly like coolpix 5900 preowned . very delicate , warranty not clear wheather it 1 day or 60 or 90 or 365 days i don't know ( made indonesia shocked me hopfully nothing happen)at end i am happy it , my kids happy it you don't need more than	1
camera great qualities such good price . if you read manuel , it makes it even easier camera used . camera amazon including shipping less than 200 dollars , all other cameras only 5.0 megapixel 3x optical zoom set up 300 dollars . if you care tinyness camera won't mind paying few extra hundred camera same qualities then this one isn't you .	1

i very happy product . it serves me well . fast delivery , good service vender . i large project it serve me well into future . adds my large studio lights added ability focus lighting small projects .	1
i found materials used construction photo box very nice quality . portable design well thought out . one my favorite features camera stand . this better than tripod models because it stays out way while changing subjects within box . lamps heat up very quickly . they very nice broad spectrum . however , order keep melting them i connected them power strip just flick switch my foot right when i'm going shoot photo . otherwise , what i shot this studio come out well . soft white sides take glare off anything . box well suited items small pins or large bust necklace . this least expensive photo studio i came across but i can't imagine reason recommend anything else jewelry photography	1
i can't believe they haven't made more these so hard find now ! i've mine year now it awesome . finally handy marriage still camera video camera . parents grandparents everywhere i go wish they one catch every fun moment kids . my only complaint low-light capabilities . pictures just won't turn out movies terrible unless you're outside or inside bright lights	1
i bought this case my panasonic dmc-fz30 digital camera . while i only this case week now , i am still confident this case going meet my needs well . it reminds me women purse sense there seem endless amount pockets put stuff . there even net side hold water bottle . i should no trouble fitting camer , plus lens hood other small accessories . main compartment movable divider , so i keep camera easily separated charger lens hood . review amazon questioned quality . i not used it long enough know sure , but it looks like it hold up well	1
million words written this thing , this not attempt comprehensive review , so look above or dpreview-com complete info . i looked canon , nikon , pentax sony dslrs . sony makes sense if you already bag full minolta lenses , which i don't . canon nikon put their image stabilization lens , which makes their ' good ' lenses significantly more expensive . canon eos not backward-compatible their old fd lenses , which i -do- bagful . pentax backward-compatible all k-mount lenses made since 1970s , even take 645 6x7 lenses , adapters . sooo , i set out ease into dslr ownership k100d , then started reading reviews , it bunch little things made me want k10d . viewfinder actual prism , not mirror cage like cheaper cameras , displays backlit , low-res mode ( 1800 1200px ) exactly what i want certain applications . 10 mpx , i point shoot if i , crop ( somewhat ) more later . controls more ' classic ' camera-like than ' scene modes ' beginner cameras . not say this would worth price difference everyone , but i bought k10d , pentax 12-24mm / 4.0 lens , am very happy both . digital cameras use less image projected lens , so your lenses ' longer ' than they would film camera . downside : ' journalist lens ' , buy 12-24mm , which equivalent 18-36mm film camera . upside : my old 50mm / 1.4 now equivalent top-of-the-line portrait lens i never felt i could afford . pentax plans introduce 2007 16-50mm / 2.8 50-135mm / 2.8 , which sound fantastic - but let see what they cost before we get too excited . meanwhile , sigma , tokina , tamron offer some very adequate alternatives . camera lens together pretty heavy , just like older slr , led screen cannot used live viewfinder - no image gets sensor while mirror down - so you hoist camera your eye compose shot . no problem , i'm used it , it common all dslrs . (( my personal feeling slr platform just . it hard see need mirror box digital camera , which use actual sensor compose shot through lens display it back . future top-end digital cams probably lot flatter , like old rangefinder cameras . look olympus e330 or panasonic dmc-l1 see what direction i think we should headed . )) said , i am very happy pentax k10d , it behaves it supposed , affordable ( barely ) 12-24mm rectilinear lens unthinkable just few years ago . this camera ton half features capabilities , i am still sorting them out . there definitely learning curve if you get most out camera , but there also two full program modes , including ' green zone ' , so you start shooting right away good results . pictuers come out great . colors , brightness , contrast need almost no adjustment or photoshop-ing , which not true any other digi-cam i ever owned . happy this , until next big thing comes	1
i owned * ist dl 8 month bought this upgrade . i don't any experience cannon or nikon . so my review mostly based comparison * ist dl . hope this help those same situation . i am not pro not pro . so i only need decent but inexpensive camera handful choice lenses . i bought k10d mainly ( 1 ) shake reduction ( 2 ) dust removal ( 3 ) raw button ( 4 ) 10mb ccd . course , there plenty other features expect . this pice level , i think k10d beats cannon nikon any others . plus , i da 50-200mm couple m42 takumar manual lenses . sticking pentax best me . after 150 test shots , i share you some my opinions : pros : -- shake reduction great ( but it its limit) -- dust removal comes handy -- raw button very useful -- manual choice any one 11 focus points , great composition -- faster focus than * ist dl -- rich functions , e.g. sv mode , program line -- support iso 100cons : -- weather-seal not mean too much if you don't get weather-sealed lenses -- 10m not much bigger than 6m (* ist dl ) , it good but don't expect big difference ( but this not pentax or k10d problem) -- battery meter drop full empty without stopping half-empty status -- pentaprism viewfinder not brighter than pentamirror my * ist dl ( least no noticable difference) -- shutter release not crispy * ist dl ( just personal feeling)it bigger heavier than ist dl . great ergo design . i am happy k10d . i take one star off cons listed . ps : ccd/stablizer slides inside ( even power off ) when you flip camera . little scary when i first got it . but after some reading i think it " normal " .	1
i loved lens cleaner kit , it comes lens cleaner bottle , moist lens cleaner cloths , lens cloth itself ... great carrying case those moments when carrying camera u need clean your lens fast , effective way .	1
reason i purchased this camera delay how long it takes actually take picture after pushing shutter button . every other camera i tried this price range unnaceptable . coolpix series reasonable level performance shutter delay . now i camera , used it , i am impressed how easy it use , it performance . however , this camera kill batteries if you use flash , but it takes good pictures flash turned off , batteries last lot longer way . no glare or uneven lighting too!i've using alkaline batteries , so i don't know recommended ni/mh type , but if you use alkalines i recommend when batteries stop working camera , save batteries use mini-mag flashlight(or other device ) they not really run down all way judging how much light i get my mini-mag , they're only 50% when camera decides stop working	1
this camera flaws may irritate more seasoned adept photographers than me . however , amateur looking room grow , this camera great value money . i drawn s5100 because its automatic manual settings . i figured i could slowly learn how use more advanced functions while still able take photos . 10x optical zoom major bonus . colors fade bit full zoom , so you won't get same terrific , sharp images lower magnifications , but it still beats heck out point-and-shoot 3x optical zoom cameras . i've owned s5100 over year , though i love it , it few significant shortcomings : 1 . while it takes beautiful pictures bright sunlight , indoor non-flash pictures taken without aid tripod often blurry . s5100 takes some beautiful night shots ( tripod ) , however . 2 . shutter speed automatic settings slow , start-up once you turn it takes too long . also , if you turn camera off , then immediately turn it again , it often won't turn . you need wait beat after turning it off before turning it again . it not annoying because you don't often need immediately turn it back after turning it off . 3 . view-finder digital , not optical . when you look through it , you're seeing digital image , not actually looking through lens . i find it difficult see image viewfinder , so i only use lcd screen . unfortunately , lcd screen hard see when it very sunny . 4 . it hard take incognito shots , because camera makes lot noise ( beeping when it turns , artificial film-camera-type " click " when it takes photo ) . said , i love this camera would buy it again . i live overseas often post photos my travels online send friends relatives back home . they always ooh ah over my photos frequently ask what sort camera i . s5100 offers lot bang buck	1
i read through all reviews here amazon , best one rueffer . he accurately explains how get best output frame , i followed his instructions my pictures display perfect no black sidebars . compact flash compatibility great , so usb port , although usb drive sticking out looks sort ugly , so compact flash or sd card way go . i managed put 1000+ pictures 128mb card if you follow instructions rueffer sizing them down . only reason i gave this frame 4/5 because mp3 compatibility works fine , but it would great if it could play simultaneously while showing pictures . however , music plays separately , which kind silly . overall , price , this great frame it works fine last month i've it	1
digital picture frame very good display very easy use i purchased one some time ago bought this one christmas gift . it well worth cost	1
but you take some pretty darn good pictures , very good video . definatly not evening or night time ... it needs light- lots it . i found it very usefull fun . it needs memory card ! it only hold like two songs without memory card , just few pics . just buy cheap card you fit alot more various medias you store . i really no complaints this except maybe i wish it worked night	1
i this lens 3 years . it never let me down - it amazing macro range . i use this lens portraits models well nature close-ups . this lens designed film format cameras , so shooting it digital gives you sweet spot lens circle covering digital sensor . highly recommended . only negative thing i think this lens i wish it f/ 2.8 aperture instead f/ 3.5 - 4.5 ...	1
this great starter camera if you thinking getting into videograghy . this camera give you pro look , but it seems just consumer level camera pro package . quality seems very good however , i only shot few hrs tape so far . if you come up extra $1000 seriously consider different camera really pro level	1
lot softer than i thought it going but very nice . job very well	1
feels like it made cardboard ? nonsense !! structure made very rigid plastic panels covered some kind synthetic material textured - - supposedly - - look like surface camera . camera barely fits into case - - but this good thing , because it keeps small size camera intact . overpriced ? all sony accessories always overpriced ; get over it . if you buy this camera - - which i recommend - - then you need this case	1
i purchased this camera my sixteen year old niece . it only 3.2 mp so picture quality isn't good 5.0 mp , however , 3.2 mp above average quality . this great starter camera young person or teenager . it compact , easy use menu items , cool charger base . batteries run out little too fast but so ones my expensive 5.0 mp camera . it nature beast ... person who wrote review pictures dark didn't turn flash . flash must turned low light . if they read directions , they would figured out . once flash turned pictures come out perfect . don't hesitate buy this affordable camera someone starter . it great device . i gave this " 4 " stars because price , features , slim body . i thought " 5 " stars too high because it not serious picture taker , it great " first " camera .	1
this battery i use my e-volt 500 . i've impressed i've never needed change it mid-session . what more there say ? it battery that reliable job well	1
this battery shoots shoots shoots ! i used it ten days faily heavy shooting it up challenge . it much , much better than buying alkaline batteries	1
1 . i ordered this very close christmas . data said there would three five business day delay . binoculars mailed out next day . i recieved notice mailing they arrived time christmas . i am very impressed . 2 . they shipped carefully arrived good shape	1
i recently went new york found it quiet amazing watch things empire state building . it not adjustability but than mentioned product description . price it goes it definitely very good product	1
seldom i bought anything fulfilled my expectations extent this kodak v610 . simplicity it menu buttons , it many modes shooting person master controls one sitting bit experimentation . 2 gig sd card you get 1056 pics full resolution or 56 minutes tv quality video sound . stitch panarama mode effortless fun . would great scenics real estate work . i most like it " portability which fulfills first rule photography , " bring camera " . it fits easily any pocket . like any light weight camera it impossible hold steady long telephoto shots which 10x optical 4x digital allows . however fixed tripod . steady shot video mode however work quite well . pictures crisp color clean , great pics ! also love large clear lcd monitor framing grid allowing me look professional taking shots . so many good things built i could get writers cramp extolling it " virtues , so i end saying i am way more than pleased my new camera .	1
i love large number photos available . course amazon customer service excellent . even free shipping very quick	1
two years ago christmas , my husband gave me kodak easyshare photo printer . i absolutely love it . ( fyi - you don't kodak camera use this printer . i fuji . ) my first big print photo christmas cards . i took fun , casual photo kids i liked better than anything i'd ever store photography studio . i could print out many photo cards i wanted , cost much , much less than what it would cost me " professional " christmas cards . i made my own christmas photo again this year ! time purposes alone , it saves me time spent running store every time i take some photos . ( which often . ) not mention considerable amount time i used spend standing line . convenience sake , it no-brainer . example , i putting together portfolio last-minute homeschool evaluation needed photo or two highlight my daughter progress . all i turn my easyshare printer press " print . " i'm getting ready put together photo display my son wedding . how nice browse through my collection photos , scan older non-digital ones i want print them i need them , or just simply press " print " my more recent digital collection . no matter when i need photo , i ability print it immediately . quality wonderful , fun watch it prints out first yellow , then layers blue , then red . cartridges paper matched so when you've printed 40 photos , it time new cartridge . you always enough paper cartridges ; you always enough cartridges paper . after year use , printer started trouble grabbing photo paper . i contacted kodak ; they gave me instructions how clean printer . my husband cleaned printer per instructions , it working perfectly once again . i always buy ph160 count cartridge w/paper my printer . first all , because it lots cheaper than 40 or 80 count . secondly , i lot scrapbooking , i use lots photos . buying kodak ph160 cartridges w/paper amazon saves me big bucks . amazon usually it much less than retail . i've checked . if you keep eye it , amazon frequently sell it much less than retail . since this item cost over $25 , there no shipping . , there no sales tax . i guess over course owning printer , i've spent , average , 25 cents per photo . i print what i want , when i want it . great deal !	1
excellent product great value price . product easy use photo quality great	1
just came back orlando vacation it . i am very impressed video still picture quality . non-pro consumer , i think it perfect product	1
i received sony hdr-hc7 over two weeks ago . this hd camcorder 3rd final piece my hd makeover . first component sony kds-r60xbr2 1080p tv , second ps3 , now new camcorder . one thing i noticed immediately upon playing my older home-made dv videos big screen really amplifies lower resolution ( which bad ) , hand jitter home movies more problematic well look . both these deficiencies prompted me go this hd camcorder optical stabilization . impressions after using this camcorder different locations ( snow , indoor , beach ): pros -- video great , especially filling 60 inch screen . images look smooth , not always necessarily eye-popping sharp , but very pleasing . clip arcade beach its many sounds especially many bright colors made very rich video experience big screen . - still images excellent . 6.1 megapixels , they good any 6 mp still camera ( i comparison ) . my test still cameras print 8x10 glossies . when you , it easy judge excellent , good , not-so-good . 8x10 prints excellent . moreover , camera 10x optical zoom , so major advantage still photography . flash surprisingly robust- better than most smaller still cameras . this camcorder truly opens up possibility leaving still camera home . - dv tape cost-effective convenience . i popped standard sony premium dv tape everything fine . so far , i've not seen any evidence frame dropping after 1 hour hd videotaping . everything smooth very eye-pleasing . i carefully considered other alternatives hdd dvd burners , but overall ease-of-use , dv proven cost-effective way take lot videos store them conveniently . - sony offers case underwater video ( sony camcorder marine case ( spk-hcb )) . this case which listed accessory offers good value considering custom camcorder cases run excess $1k . i bought one custom-adapt mounting plate because hole pattern not quite right . i used it while it snowing beach it worked very well ( case its own stereo microphone ) . i'm planning use it very soon some snorkeling . such underwater home footage should very cool . case really protects camera elements . case surprisingly sophisticated . example , it uses mirror access camcorder display . it turns out once connected properly , image lcd display backwards , so it seen correctly when looking reflected image mirror . well thought-out product indeed . cons -- it not most elegant or stylish hardware . - not neck strap . - audio not its strong point- nothing bad , but not particularly compelling . - i like use fader feature separate different tape segments , but accessing fade button through display touch-screen method takes too many strokes . once i start tape , it bothersome activate fader function during taping . - on-the-fly stills 16:9 widescreen so overall resolution printed paper not good stand-alone stills which standard 4:3 . - naturally , substantial investment camcorder unit , comes additional costs options such ( 1 ) stand-alone battery charger , ( 2 ) extra high-capacity battery , ( 3 ) better microphone , ( 4 ) external light source video stills . i already external mike ( sony ) double external light ( still video ) . i haven't used these enough yet provide proper review . this early camcorder review would not complete without mentioning significant value added using playstation 3 . camcorder video stored dv tape mpeg2 format . after recording , i simply transfer video into my ulead videostudio 10 plus which handles hdv files . after i copy mpeg2 file into hard drive ps3 using transportable hard drive . roughly speaking , one hour hd recording takes up 10 gb memory . one then watch hd video big screen using handy remote ($25 ) ps3 fast forward such so overall operation almost convenient if you burned bluray dvd . also , fact sxrd tv 3rd hdmi input front makes connecting camcorder particularly convenient . bottom line- camcorder very impressive . picture 60 " screen ranges very good eye-popping . colors very rich . i've primarily covered basic functions so far but there more learn explore this unit . coupling 1080p tv ps3 camcorder results most enjoyable hd experience .	1
i'm army i got this camera field camera . i taken it everywhere me since then it proved very durable camera well taking good quality pics video . i used it temps -30 120 it worked just fine when other cameras wouldn't . only reason i'm not giving it five stars because wifi feature only works every once while . other than this great camera	1
i read all these reviews cannot life me understand all crying whining wifi mode . i keep hearing how " complicated " " annoying " it , but this just plain wrong . i actually set my wifi up yesterday , you want know how long it took me ? minute . pop setup cd , click " wireless setup only " , plug your camera usb cable ( you need only this first time set up ! setup cd give you all directions , just follow ) , install it ( takes all few seconds ) , choose your connection mode , name , icon , you're . then unplug usb cable ( you now no longer need it ! ) , rotate click-wheel top camera wifi-mode , click " ok " voila ( you'll see wifi antenna flash blue ) . easy , it download all images your camera fast speed without any wires needed . how god name people making this out big deal ? read your manual you'll fine . i my homework literally months ended up choosing this model . i know cameras this easily best deal money . get familiar scene modes , they're absolutely phenomenal there something every shot angle . each scene mode choice 3 different effects , which really nice . variety shots you able take second none . 5 mp perfect compromise image quality , resolution , price . nikon always top-rate . photography something seems run family when my grandfather approved this camera , i knew it truly grea t.t he screen this thing amazing . 2.5 inches ! loss viewfinder something you won't even notice , lcd far more accurate tool anyway . erasing pictures simple , operating zoom piece cake , zoom nikkor lense one best market , ( schneiderkreuznach lenses kodaks carl zeiss lenses sonys ) . nothing against canon elph line because they're amazing , but lense nikon better i honestly feel canon models overpriced . ever picked up sd400 or 450 ? they feel far too tiny almost flimsy . sd500 550 bit better , but there virtually nothing grip . trust me , when you want really focus subject get perfect shot , last thing you want not firm enough grip your camera it slip . this also increases likelihood dropping it , which never good thing ! some complain red-eye reducer takes too long . flash go off three times red-eye-eliminator mode , so if you're taking picture your dog , turn it off , ( because subject moved then ) . people though , it fine . p2 comes great software it take all 5 seconds remove red-eye manually once uploaded if time before final flash goes off bothers you too much . i've heard whining p2 size ... why ? pick one up if you look one person . they're wondefully compact yet still heft them , very substantial hand grip doubles battery casing . it all metal beautifully designed , worksmanship speaks itself . nikon great choice , i also recommend olympus kodak ( kodaks king easy-to-use cameras ) . even full price this camera worth it ( 400 dollars ) , though you'll see it advertised 250-350 , which very fair prices . you're going love it , it very capable little machine take you gorgeous pictures . nothing off-limits there scene mode any situation . i no regrets . rechargable battery good save you money . i highlyyyy recommend you purchase lcd screen covers protect your very-large lcd screen . these bought ebay packs 3 10 dollars shipping	1
snaps high quality pictures super fast came batteries seem last forever ! what more could person want ? it even stores video snips effeciently . we've this camera several months , used it frequently , love it . my only warning don't let batteries run low ( ok , so they really don't last forever ! ) . we run into problems where we couldn't properly turn camera off when batteries low	1
camera excellent one , it took very high-quality pictures ; however , it broke little more than year after i bought it , it wouldn't power unknown reason , it exactly 14 days out one-year warranty ! repair cost rather expensive : $184 . i would rather buy new one than send it repair	1
i owned panasonic fz7 1 year excited purchase fz8 . there so many excellent qualities this camera offers . it very simple use beginner offers features suit professional . preview screen perfect size its bright vivid colors . settings easy change , including : shutter speed , aperture , time date , changing focus point , many other awesome features ! picture quality awesome , even 12x zoom , my prints not turn out grainy . nice light weight easy grip . now , dislikes .... only one . this camera not offer automatic pop-up flash . i remember open it . i cannot comment video this camera , i use sony handycam all my video needs . overall , i would highly recommend this camera even fz7 anyone interested starting out simple use camera	1
i lot hiking usually carry my dslr my backpack , which makes it awkward take out pictures . since getting this harness my camera always ready i take 20 times many shots out hike	1
haven't tried it windy conditions yet but i like it lightweight , easy transport extends 70 inches . extra height extension prevents you stooping over when shooting videos . good value , free shipping ( delivered 5 days hawaii - not bad ! ) amazon only makes it better ! highly recommended	1
this digital camera awesome . i no problem batteries . i made sure i put good batteries ( no cheap ones ) . i looked purchasing canon hp but features it this one outstanding price . i purchased this camera 1gb card it . i can't wait start using it when i go san diego march ..... awesome digital camera ...... you won't sorry this purchase ...	1
i purchased this my son he really likes everything camera . he loves quality pictures . he mention camera proprietary cable hooks his computer - just fyi	1
i needed battery my sony camera . amazon best price sony battery . however , my search revealed this combo which includes battery cheaper than battery alone . well , no-brainer ! it turns out , camera bag great item also . time , this outstanding deal	1
i've this scope 4 months now i very pleased it . firstly , i received it only three days amazon . secondly , i genuinely pleased all components made alloy or other metal , unlike particular meade unit , which i used lots plastic screws other parts . even tightening screws lens mounts red-dot sight metal this celestron . aluminum tripod quite sturdy adjustable ; good little guys girls star-gaze too . housing tube black aluminum sturdy well . red-dot sighter works well , especially when looking stars/planets high-power lens , less eye relief . magnification clarity views really good . i've seen rings saturn jupiter quite clearly this scope . i also purchased celestron eyepiece kit offers additional plossy lens ( varying power ) pretty good set filters ( including moon filter ) . only down side i think would lubricant used company rotating axis ' quite sticky if you get it ya . money , you're not going regret buy you'll probably glad you went this quality model over lesser ones , might even cost more . celestron good product this one . hope this helps some .	1
this my first experience this type battery , i quite pleased . i took it hawaii able shoot all day one battery	1
rechargeable batteries very good charger faster than manual says . it always faster than 3 hours it says	1
i such hard time choosing right hard drive camcorder ! according most comments web all hd camcorders poor quality , or software problems or something else . so i decide myself end i converged this one , which great pick , so easy use , incredible quality , so far no problems burning dvds ! slight compatibility problems existing burning software present my laptop sony software ... but once solved , i love it i love touchscreen ! i got whole package extra battery , but i still haven't used it ! battery lasts pretty long .	1
this great case protects my dscl1 very well . nice compact , not bulky all fits perfectly ! leather soft but it hard enough withstand impact . only reason i give it 4 stars instead 5 it doesn't pocket memory sticks	1
i bought last year model canon elph series because it cf card rather than sd card . when i needed extra battery , i found genuine canon battery , this kit cheaper than just battery alone . small leather case nice too , you get large handbag case free well . throw amazon super saver shiping , this deal can't beat . just make sure this right accessory kit your camera . it doesn't fit current models	1
local retail shops it $69.99 . so i saved $10 shipping . includes battery , leather case ( which strapped your belt ) , carrying case all accessories . only gripe us postal service . they're just inept . they attempted deliver business saturday ( when they weren't open ) couldn't redeliver till following friday . next time i'll pay few bucks extra get professionals ( ups , fedex , etc . ) deliver	1
dc-hc48 great camera very nicely sized easy use . i chose this version instead hc38 due support stills improved ccd . picture quality good light great . i actually displayed it my 60 inch tv picture good normal television . i very impressed picture . it also nice how easy it switch aspect rations either 16:9 ( wide-screen ) 4:3 ( standard ) . however it got darker outside light got lower inside i notice much " color " picture began fade picture became somewhat mono-tone . this seems common complaint cameras this price range low-light . i took camera into dark room ( i couldn't see thing ) i turned night mode very impressed . people things showed up great pitch black . ir light emitted camera picked up nicely acted like flashlight only camera would pick up . subject 5-10 feet away course image best center . effect very much like survivor night shots , or blair witch projec t.t he camera two modes operation . normal node , which allows you custom set settings like set focus , exposure , white balance , or effects like old film etc or set settings auto . easy mode , which lets you basically turn beeping off leaves all settings set auto . issue i found easy mode still pictures not work . also you stop recording switch easy normal mode . still photos fine quality considering its 1 mega-pixel camera . i wouldn't recommend using this your primary still photo camera though its nice option . touch screen i found somewhat cumbersome since you scroll through looking choices you want . so if you want make setting change quickly if you unfamiliar camera it might take while find . i also tend shake camera some when i use touchscreen . nice feature you create your own custom activity list so settings you set frequently more accessible then those you don't use . where i most disappointed accessories . standard battery it ships lasts 1.5 hours , which seems like reasonable time considering minidv tape only holds 60-90 minutes depending your setting . but like all batteries 1.5 ideal conditions not real world turning camera off playing features zooming out etc . additionally battery takes 1 hour 40 minutes charge which surprising . unfortunately battery not newer actiforce batteries which charge approximately 20 minutes ( actiforce charger ) . also take still photos you'll need buy separate memory stick duo card . ( not memory stick , memory stick duo smaller form factor ) . usb cable ships camera lets you get still photos camera ( attached dock ) onto your computer . however it not let you get video . instead you need fire-wire cable which not included . sony sells this cable around $40 . belkin makes cable around $12 . fire-wire ( i . link ) cable only allows you download video onto your computer ( not still photos ) . again you must attached docking station . if your traveling wish download computer you'll need bring docking station you ( it pretty small but my hassle bring you ) . docking station one way charge camera or you connect it wall supplied cables . unfortunately there only one power cable dock camera so if you plan just bring power cable you'll disconnect it docking station . short camera great just aware you might buying some more cables , batteries , chargers , memory sticks or other accessories end up affecting your total price ownership . sony brand name versions these accessories surprisingly pricey	1
recommendation photographer friend , i bought this kodak c875 camera . i wanted smaller , easy-to-use camera printer would produce high-quality , permanent photos or without my computer . moment , i'm using it without my computer , so i can't comment software , ubs connection , etc . this produces terrific , durable , quality photos , camera system easy use , once you figure them out . most electronics , instructions minimal not very well written . troubleshooting , online or not , annoying unhelpful . i'm moderately electronic/computer literate , although definitely not technogeek . but i fix basic stuff my computer , security systems programs online help -- i should proficient enough benefit kodak online info . instead , after fishing around not getting what i needed , i relied trial error . ( kodak , you listening ? )like reviewer , i've trouble paper feed . first time i tried use it , printer kept signaling there no paper tray , regardless how much or how little paper i put . i almost sent it back based problem , but kept it , hoping it one-time thing . problem resolved somewhat , but paper still doesn't always feed properly , sometimes needs bit push into feeder . even so , i'm impressed overall quality ease use , especially such reasonable price . cartridges easy handle , printer/paper cost less than photo-developing service , especially since you only print what you want . it so small , it invites you take it parties , family gatherings , etc ., it hard beat instant gratification nice photos send home guests . plus , it just looks cool when it printing -- very entertaining anyone who hasn't seen it before . if i could , i'd give it three half stars based quality prints , ease use portability . kodak great concept , but still some work . but i'd give them benefit doubt , buy this printer/camera again	1
i purchased kodak camera printer dock 4 years ago our daughter family . i impressed ease use both . i sony camera printer when camera needed work i decided go new kodakz650 . i love camera it so easy use . all grandkids take photos it dock plus . just snap camera it loads your computer or print out any photo you want . i think this good setup easy use . tooty hallber	1
sony alpha a100k best camera i ever owned . images nothing short spectacular . lens mount allows you use telephoto lenses other camera . i expensive telephoto lens my old 35mm minolta it fit this sony digital perfectly . you notice lot minolta features this sony since minolta left camera business . image stabilization feature makes it real hard mess up shot . if you beginner or pro , this camera easy use perfect pictures every time	1

this great camera wedding videographer or other serious amateur or semi-professional . it well built , great manual control , takes super video including good low-light performance . you probably want external mic attachment , which lets you use professional microphones without additional adapters signal processors . now price well below $2000 , it great deal . one caveat : if you plan shoot 16:9 format , this not best choice . panasonic gs400 handles much better , lower price . ( but gs400 doesn't low-light chops dvc-30 - so you set your priorities . ) plusses : * very good low light capability * sturdy , metal body construction * take professional external microphones ( optional attachment )* unbelievable bw no-light capability infrared ( short range built into camera ; medium range add-on ir light increases range hundreds feet . )* excellent manual control available via menu you put your favorite four settings programmable buttons camera body extra convenience . * without attachments , body built-in mic small consumer-like ( won't draw attention itself ) , not mention light-weight . * lovely video three 1/4-inch ccd . minuses : * sony 2100 even better low-light ability * 16:9 mode isn't good pdx10 or gs400 . * still picture capability only adequate . * built-in mic only average	1
this great machine , simply put , takes superb pictures . i experience using great number point shoot cameras this definitely best . features give great control over what you shoot if you so inclined use them know bit more photography . but if not you just use auto mode take unbelievable pictures . pictures i take this camera often look better than ones i take my 8mp canon rebel . video also great quality compared any other point shoot cameras . price , this camera spectacular ! if you even considering buying it then please make purchase , you won't let down	1
fuji f10 outstanding camera small problem : when shooting brilliant sun light trying frame picture , screen sometimes hard see .	1
while i am still learning how use all " bells whistles " , i think this camera awesome ! i suppress flash , force flash , reduce red-eye , take pictures low light .. best all , lcd display so large i review pictures immediately really see them . all my friends family comment size screen . recent family gathering , everyone wanted review pictures immediately rather than wait me get home e-mail them ! my nephew camera tiny screen no one asking see his pictures because you would need magnifying glass see anything !	1
only negative these binoculars they come really cheesy plastic strap , which i promptly threw away . otherwise they function fine bargain binocular	1
this got best camera money you buy right now !! i looking affordable camera , small thin , well-known name brand , takes sharp digital photos , shoot low light , uses cheap sd cards , good-sized lcd display , take decent videos . well , this casio exilim everything more , great price . i used it so much during my out-of-state travels without running out power or memory ( i bought 2gb sd card $20 [ ... ] i take more 1000 hi-res photos or hour video ) . i absolutely surprised how good videos i shoot this small digital camera , now i decided not buy new video camcorder , this casio exilim all i would need any occasion . if you're market great camera , look no further than casio exilim	1
i own nikon coolpix 3100 camera no complaints it , except fact its size ( even though it fairly small ) pain carry around when you want take pictures . looking much thinner camera , i came across this one quite pleasantly surprised its size , its ability take really great shots ! i'm merely birthday - holiday type picture taker , but this camera definitely enable me take more pictures , because i'll carrying it around my pockety whennever i go somewhere might provide photo opportunity .	1

i've seen some bad digital frames- ones stretch out picture , making everyone look fat , or dim displays bad color . philips frame absolutely opposite : it delightfully easy use picture quality great . pictures automatically sized , cropped , even rotated when you turn frame . i didn't need software they included . i just dumped pile pictures cf card ( using my camera wired computer ) then plugged card into frame . menus frame navigated little joystick back . it not nicest menu system , but i got hang it pretty quickly . if you buying this grandma ( course ) here tip : buy two memory cards so you switch photo albums when you visit	1
philips 8-inch digital picture frame excellent , high-quality device . very easy get it going - included cable computer software make it simple select digital pictures already stored your computer copy them onto device . no need mess around memory cards - although device accepts those well if works best you . everyone who seen ours loves it . it looks great picture quality size excellent	1

this camera awsome cause you store music it take pictures too , one only stupid things ... it doesn't work tripod so , i suggest you don't buy tripod if you buy this camera	1
purchased this unit new $160 . good performance - little practice , getting readings well over 800 yards , even bright sunlight . also like fact it uses standard aaa cells . housing design leaves bit desired - it bulky , battery cover not very secure . see losing cover easily . not ergonomic more recent models . overall , $160 rangefinder genuine 800 yard performance , good deal	1
i havent gotten these before but they look like good pair binoculars . i suggest adding these your wish list if you like outdoors	1
i'm very satisfied this product , enhance highly pictures sharpness low light conditions , i've olympus sp-350 , takes pics like professional camera this flash !, i highly suggest this product everyone desire better pics low light condition ! this flash reach more than 30mts long	1
flash works great . i'm thankful it auto programmed works off cameras settings making picture taking quite easy	1
i recently went new york found it quiet amazing watch things empire state building . it not adjustability but than mentioned product description . price it goes it definitely very good product	1
this digital camera best . i cannot complain any aspect it . it huge amount modes settings additional features add pictures you taking them . it small enough fit into your pocket not think it ( it smaller than wallet ) . it takes excellent pictures come out looking great , all very high quality . huge screen makes it easy view what you looking great image quality . videos equally good , great sound good picture . it looks better than just any other digital camera i seen . even though i said i cannot complain , there few things slightly annoy me occasionally . first it flashes twice . remember tell this people before taking their picture ! after first flash , people tend look away , time second flash comes picture taken , moment lost . this only occurs when camera set " auto " mode . i usually press menu button choose mode . when you this , flashes occur very quickly ( you barely notice gap them ) . some features very useful . i use " backlight " mode quite often . it allows you take picture something even if there bright light background . my only other complaint those us large fingers , circular button operates pretty much every feature difficult use ( sometimes i push 2 buttons once , or complete wrong one ) . but everything else this camera cancels it out . this camera more features better quality than many larger more expensive cameras out there	1
this 3rd digital camera i use , it really impressive . here highlights : -first off i loved video feature , you get decent 640x480 sound , since camera so small , you'll always able capture those special moments , it also comes usb cable connect pc cable connect camera t.v ( video audio out)-the rechargable lion battery also comes charger very nice feature , digital cameras notrious battery drainers , i separate budget batteries ( aa ) my former camera , those aint cheap ! - so you wont worry this this one . -it also voice recorder so you record notes when you taking still photos . negative sides : - you need buy separate sd memory because high resolution stills videos take lot memory , you'll need least 512mb , better yet go 1gb . -the special effects button back camera kinda useless , it turn pictures into monochrome , b/w . sepia etc . or negative , _ biggest negative thing i found it takes way too long actually capture picture even low res . flash goes twice red eye reduction ( very impressive results ) but whole process slooow , so you end up not taking shot you intended , i am still trying figure out how disable this feature so it takes photos faster . this may only real negative feature this camera .	1
i decided i wanted this while before i got it . i read reveiws i realized majority them postive . there nothing wrong it , microphone works really good but you not watch your videos sound camera . it take around 300 some pictures 60 minutes video super sine mode , where it uses most megapixels . it definetly something i would recommend anyone	1
i purchased 9 yr old it great camera . takes excellent qulaity . battery life good . my cannon nikon really no better . she takes pictures everything never flaw . seems very sturdy camera built very well . i bought becasue samsung name . i purchased many samsung products before very happy them . i've used theri customer service other products i've found them quick respnse helpful . i would recommend this camera any age child or adult . +++ only thnig i don't like lens not cover when off . i not experienced any problems but i am keeping eye out just case . i still recommend this quality camera	1
hi .... i purchased this camera my daughter after looking several " person " best buy then looking far wide net . this camera her choice she loved using it . so , while , i've not used it myself i safely say this good purchase good price . also black case makes it quite " hip " or least i'm told since 65 my " hipness " days maybe behind me ! lt ;	1
this must nikon cameras , battery don't last much instead change them all time , i just plug it still shots or photo shoots click away	1
this little beauty really everything it claims . there so many shooting formats you spoilt choice . only problem i there so many formats it take me lot practice able pull fast point shoot anything other than normal light . i tend better less choices but many people undoubtedly love it . however , internal guide very helpful -- it choose format you need if you few moments consult it . its size perfect body feels good your hand . huge viewscreen size . 1 gig card extra battery , i'm set travel	1
it what it but works easy carry compact tripod , comes hand	1
you amazed see difference clarity photo shot without tripod tripod . tripod must . this cute little tripod sony makes job easier carry it around your camera . i gave it 4 star because sometimes tripod not able hold weight camera tends fall . i sony dsc-p200 camera which very light-weight . this tripod not able hold weight such light camera . you can't use it your heavier cameras or camcorders ..	1
picture quality good , but when you take flash off you hold still take picture or it blur . if you flash you moving or car taking picture it not blur . overall i really like this camera wide viewing screen awesom	1
this 5th digital camera i owned i think none compared quality vs price this one . i little frightened some reviews but after getting this camera i taken 200 pics last 4-5 days ( learning how use different settings ) i am really pleased i ordered it . all new products you buy you learn how they work . more options , more learn . i impressed movie quality also most cameras not great quality . i converted quicktime wma dvd they looked great big screen tv . only little drawback i see door card i am very careful when opening . i always carried couple spare batteries if you buy charger keep them charged there no problem . this i think true all battery based items lot use . i also keep 3-4 extra cards storage . you don't depend flashlights not keep extra batteries or blame flashlight when it quits	1
this great camera ! finally someone made camera takes whole field view , not just small portion it . also image quality excellent . i took some pictures low lighted restaurant without flash they came out extremely well . normal lighting conditions pictures sharp color excellent . screen menu also very intuitive easy use . down side , there few minor issues . first , it rather annoying focal length jumps 23mm all way 39mm then zooms up there . i would preferred second lense began 32mm or 34mm rather than 39mm so more mid-range available . second , battery rather small . i would preferred battery larger so it would last longer . i haven't issue battery running out me , but i know it would last longer if it bigger . third , ( this issue all pocket cameras , not just v705 ) , i wish someone would make camera case belt clip well battery pocket . i haven't able find anywhere any my pocket cameras . all all , this great camera . i also own canon sd300 ( which also great camera ) but i find i take v705 me most time because beautiful wide angle shots it takes .	1
quality good , but case so much padding inside it could not hold my z740 . padding removal tho so i got it fit . it lost star becase advertised dimensions case without padding or external dimensions which not useful	1
addition review above - version passes distance data body flash use , not . also , version metal bayonet mount , plastic . build both very light " plasticy " . i used " " version d2h d2x surprisingly good results considering cost . may still better value , but least consider these differences addition those mentioned other review .	1
this camera fantastic ! when i compare printed photos this camera other 5mp cameras , i find quality superior . battery lasted week bahamas no recharge several hundred pictures taken ( just follow directions use proper batteries !! ) printer dock easy use prints very nice quality pictures fairly quickly . cost $0.30 per print , but great deal if your looking high quality prints immediately ! i think this camera great !!	1
i looking good set " cheap " binos astronomical use . most reports suggest not going over 10x magnification order ensure stability while hand-holding binos , but there enough reports these usable while held i went them . my money , these absolutely amazing . while it true outer 25% ( give or take ) field view soft blurry , field view itself so large this little impact . optics multi-coated , honestly , coatings leave bit desired , while my daylight testing made me wonder whether or not these would passable binos stargzing , first light night sky blew me away . light gathering power 70mm objectives sufficient bring milky way new life even my light polluted suburban skies , m42 wonder behold , i actually found , even only 1/4 visible , moon so bright i couldn't look it extended periods . hand-holding these binos not problem . they're lighter than i expected , i actually easier time hand-holding these than i other , much lower power binos . all-around pair binos stargazing , these things get my vote " best value . " i haven't them long enough talk longevity may ultimatley influence my opinion , but under $100 , it hard go wrong these	1
like so many before me , i've experienced white-screen problem dsc-s40 well ... fortunately , it happened after 10 months use , so i able make use warranty . i my parents send it , they few issues frustrations getting it sent back them , but it worked fine afterward . until now , . yesterday , out seemingly nowhere , screen started act strangely . i usually take black white pictures ... while white portions would remain somewhat intact , black areas replaced various ugly shades blue there streaks all over image . when i uploaded pictures my computer , they turned out fine , but now i'm scared screen die me again . little tap logo enough fix it now ( i give thanks whoever put suggestion out there ) , but these problems shouldn't even exist , especially after not even 15 months use . much i may like camera its ease use quality its pictures , although it served me well through over 15,000 shots , i'd advise people stay away it ... it more trouble than it really worth long run	1
only used charger batteries couple months but say charger works quickly . it charges 4 batteries 2 hours or so . charger compact light . batteries last long time -- 500 shots or more -- cannon 2s camera . i haven't made any comparison similar chargers or batteries	1
i actual bought this my 15 year old niece , got it just over $100 @ circuit city . i gotta say so far i'm impressed , it take great pictures , zoom before/after picture taking , audio/video capability well web cam . now i canon powershot a75 , which i love , more ability then this camera , but price if your new digital i would recommend	1
recently , i moved sony dsc 707 sony 100 dslr . change cameras cybershot dslr took some getting used . i purchased sony 75-300mm telephoto lens amazon soon it arrived i attached lens began use it . i am definitely pleased lens , price it capabilities . used slr almost 30 years , moving dslr takes some time patience . sony 100 solid perfomer , it my fourth sony digital camera . avid photographer , sony 75-300mm telephoto lens priced well provide exceptional performance . once you attach lens you discover when maximum telephoto mode , lens quite long . if you attach lens shade it even longer takes some handling considerations tight spaces . extreme focusing speeds 100 rapid vary it adjusts optimim focus . lens auto mode constant adjustment . this focus issue takes some getting used . lens balances quite nicely th 100 . most photographers , you need find best hand positions camera body lens so you feel comfortable while you shoot . lens ultra depth field sensitive . lens camera now month , i am beginning adjust its " sometimes hyper adjustment activity " ! i am no way disappointed lens because telephoto shots i kept recorded first rate sony 100 sony 75-300mm lens . all new cameras , it takes time become familiar camera settings lens activity . i highly recommend lens awarness it sensitivity length . after hours shooting i am pleased lens , sony attention detail both lens construction performance . if you own sony 100 dslr , or plan invest sony dslr system , this lens not let you down . you review your photos pleased results sony lens provides you . i intend invest other sony lens future . now , two sony lenses fulfill my photographic needs quite nicely . sony entered dslr market outstanding camera quality accessories .	1
i really like this camera . it 10x optical , image stabilization , 3.0 inch lcd 230,000 pixels , more . size great 10x zoom camera . image stabilization great getting shots would come out blurry my canon powershot a620 . my other favorite feature besides zoom image stabilization , wide angle . it great finally get cityscapes whole skyline one shot !! camera set 16x9 , i get 24mm shot ! what i don't like this camera it short battery life . even the1300mah battery i bought , i get less shots than my canon . colors photos this camera lot less colorful than canon . something i get used . i very disappointed find out this camera no zoom movie mode , unlike its predecessor , tz1 . luckily , not stop me buying this camera . overall , this camera great buy , especially if you want i.s. wide angle , long zoom	1
i went ritz camera today took good look tz3 . i'll tell you , its pretty nice . build quality really good , previous person mentioned . body metal . dials buttons click precision , nice resistance . it nice weight it . i took some nice shots store . i must clicked off 100 pics . i'm impressed it . if you want something relatively small , powerful tough , this camera you . 10x zoom great , but such small camera it difficult hold it steady enough(at least me ) use zoom too much . i love build quality style , so i may biased . it nice piece equipment . i cannot speak photo quality only seen pics camera lcd	1
i owned first generation dmc-tz1 . dmc-tz3 some welcome improvements ; wider angle , automatic lens cover , maybe 25% faster sho t-t o-shot . particular , wider angle really useful feature . camera strength its versatile , outdoor shooting . it best lots light . indoors , flash coverage just ok . sho t-t o-shot flash recycle time sometimes pokey 4 seconds . digital picture noise noticeable lesser light . setup tips : 1 . use 3x2 ratio if you primarily print 6x4 photos . 2 . use vivid mode normal mode looks washed out .	1
you would expect sony this case extremely well made design excellent . all controls still readily available easily operated when camera case . if anything , camera easier use when it case due its small size otherwise . i bought this case mainly make my t7 look like cheap plastic camera so i am more comfortable wearing it around my neck when i'm wandering around places where small expensive-looking camera might attract unwanted attention	1
sports pack case exceeded my expectations , which originally fair already ! because case designed especially dsc-t7 , it fits perfectly : once case , compact camera becomes far more accessible . it easier hold handle , case not make it any harder use any buttons . case very sleek design many people already complimented it . some people even likened it looking like psp ! i am very satisfied this purchase because it , i enjoy all functions camera without constantly worrying dropping or scratching it . i strongly recommend buying this case your dsc-t7 . beginning , i some reservations spending $90 camera case , but it really fantastic	1
camera exactly what i wanted . size great quality very good	1
while i agree others this camera takes some pretty nice pictures easy use , i've same problems many noted here . starters , thing eats through batteries like there no tomorrow . i lucky get 20 pictures before batteries crapped out . my biggest problem , however came when my son handing camera over me dinner table it slipped out his hand . camera literally fell only 10-12 inches table , but enough render this camera permanently inoperable . warned : if you little bit clumsy or butter-fingers , think twice before buying this camera ! red-eye reduction also bit joke this one	1
hp photosmart m417 5mp excellent camera it price ! only thing i recommend buy couple rechargeable batteries because any other digital cameras ... you need them	1
those card readers previous reviewer talking break after too much data transfered so not listen him . canon makes quality products their cables same i never problem them . you don't worry losing cables if they stay conneected your computer . if you don't enough room purchase usb hub	1
my first digital camera sony cybershot , i it 3 years until last december it fell into swimming pool , amazingly it still turned you could still view pictures just not take new ones . i impressed always impressed sony . so when it time new camera i picked sony cybershot dsc 9 . sony , it again ! this camera spectacular ! i purchased it december last year use it consistent basis every weekend . fantastic detail color photos , very high quality . incredibly powerful flash , my photos always look beautiful . camera sharp , sleek , modern looking . fits nicely into pocket or small purse . my opinion it one best digital camera out there right now . i love sony !	1
it excellent dvd camcorder but some problems execution edition software keep archives little traditional formats . general it excellent option purchase	1
i lot research camcorders before i decided purchase canon dc-40 . it everything i expected more . video audio quality far superior our old videotape camcorder . dc-40 gives me all tools i need get best picture sound under any condition i am shooting under . get same number pixels dc-40 offers , you might pay twice much . i am amazed how good video i get camera i carry my coat pocket	1
this machine you waiting . it so easy use . it almost anything you imagine terms still photography . it if you best digital compact camera . quality dvd movies amazing . it like looking through window when you watch your video tv . it close high defonition i ever seen . it worth while read instruction manual first , there few little things correct sequnece finalise dvd , but it very simple . sound crips clear out any noise interuptions . i would say this best dvd camcorder available moment	1
i carried this all over hawaii my backpack get those lava shots waterfalls . lightweight easy use	1
i'm not professional photographer or videographer . i just wanted this product videotape my new baby other family events my digital camcorder . tripod easy set up use . panning camera around fairly smooth easy . overall , price , i don't think this product beaten	1
this item works like it supposed . place battery charger , plug charger wall , charges battery . this can't any more simpler . good product . ( also power dcr cameras , but why ? )	1
product arrived timely manner . i not used it yet , i still need time learn how use my new photo printer . kodak name reputation got photo printer purchased first place	1
so far i like everything this camcorder . i admit , i haven't alot time any video editing computer . still pics seem look good easy download my existing kodak software . i downloaded couple clips my pc . editing software comes camcorder sucks though . camera light compact . it alot easier just carrying one camera video take pics . price high compared one model below this one . i wish i knew how good quality other model , but i thought extra zoom mp digital would worth extra expense . overall , i am satisfied	1
we purchased this camcorder our son because he enjoys movie making . this product offers excellent picture quality . video editing software comes camcorder easy use . i would recommend this product	1
great item , quality fit up nikion standards	1
camera really easy use any setting . flash great even really dark rooms . pictures crisp clear . very user friendly . still getting used 4 second delay take next picture . i know there setting it some where but not figured it out yet . otherwise great camera everyday use those us who not professional photographers trade	1
this not fitted case 8800 i expected , but also makes it usable cameras ( or what not ) size . nice quality product	1
there enough room outside pocket , mesh pocket inside top cover , memory cards , extra battery , even usb cable . set two belt loops would feel more secure than single centered belt loop provided . i still want larger belt pack ( or small backpack ) accommodate camera , accessories , other supplies all day outing	1
excellent value money . its genuine canon product half cost . fantastic deal . worth every penny . highly recommend	1
i bought two after-market batteries $12/ea . what waste ! after charging them completely camera displayed low battery warning . don't waste your money cheapo aftermarket batteries don't work . canon batteries worth extra money	1
very impressed picture colour , even low light much less granularity than other cameras we looked . there aren't too many bells whistles , but basic camcorder , you can't beat quality	1
1 . i ordered this very close christmas . data said there would three five business day delay . binoculars mailed out next day . i recieved notice mailing they arrived time christmas . i am very impressed . 2 . they shipped carefully arrived good shape	1
i bought few binoculars past couple years . satisfied only couple . these binoculars i am very pleased . clarity very good price terrific . i wasted alot money some not so good bushnell binoculars . but this pair pleasant surprise	1
i bought this because i directv wired one side my room wanted tv other side room . i could paid someone run cable up exterior insulated wall , through attic down other wall but this just plain easier . plus , i occasionally like watch game my garage while working so i plan try it my small tv . i no problems interference but it 15 feet line-of-sight i no 2.4 ghz wireless networks or phones nearest neighbor 70 feet away . when i try broadcasting garage , i update this review performance . setup trivial . it would nice able buy additional matching receivers because i would like broadcast directv commercial free radio my stereo floor . one more thing , website says this sylvania but box labeled quot ; lorexquot ; . not big deal since most electronics rebranded anyway	1
excellent product accessories . i am very happy this able find it amazon . i looked several other places could not find what i needed . thanks amazon !	1
dock very easy use connecting camera your television or computer or printer uploading your pictures . just important , since battery came docking station defective , it showed me hp customer service indeed stand behind their product . i new battery within days contacting customer service	1
this perfect case travelling , it very good , fuctional practical . it small enough travel large enough fit everything related your cammera ( cables , batteries , etc )	1
if you're looking something protect your camera getting scratched that all , then this great product . i throw my camera my purse , so i wanted something keep it getting banged up . there old review here 2004 says it like leather glove . it true , leather very soft , but it not completely soft-sided . there isn't any padding it light weight , but it slightly reinforced holds it shape when it empty . if you drop your camera high level , no , this probably not protect it breaking . but if you accidentally knock it table , this should keep it safe . there not storage , fyi . it one hole top wrist band stick through it leather loop back so you wear it your belt if you like . i think price if your purpose simple everyday wear tear protection , then this good product . if you're rough your camera , don't get this ; find something padded	1
i purchased least ten these cases i helped friends get these fine canon s500 sd550 cameras . only thing i wish canon would put pocket side extra camera battery which you should absolutely all times . this case my favorite it protects this fine little camera not intended carry half your belongings like ladies sometimes their pocketbooks ! this still best choice give your camera protection worn your belt very comfortably .	1
this case very well constructed designed . it made very soft leather lined nylon type material soft fleece or micro suede . it three pockets inside varying sizes hold sd cards and/or batteries . cases fits snuggly closes full width velcro closure . easy open close without looking . there belt loop back fit 1.25 " wide belts . i love soft leather but after month use , some wear showing corners . i buy one when this one wears out ! amazon shows this unavailable , i bought mine april 1 , 2006 local camera store $24.95 . although designed nikons , i use it my canon sd600 . it much nicer than small canon case which hard pack style case chrome snap . nikon camera easily pocketable while using camera	1
this uv filter it job protect lens well . build solid ( metal construction ) . glass also descent quality . performance , it absorbs some uv light . uv light absorbtion hardly noticeable , probably sky 1-a haze filter version absorb more uv light than this lens which fine me . now , one problem which internal reflection . i've heard many people say it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out it not caused directly low light/night situation . internal reflection appear when there strong/bright source light comparison overall exposure ( surrounding environment ) . put it example ( which hopefully easier understand ) , when you take picture lamp during nightime light much brighter than surrounding area then you see internal reflection . you move position light closer sides/corner picture ( not center picture ) , internal reflection reduces finally dissapear ( if you move light far enough center ) . if light isn't too bright/contrast compare surrounding environment then there no internal reflection . but course most time , lamp nightime often very bright . but point i'm trying make internal reflection doesn't happen all time during low light or night time . additionally , internal reflection isn't only happening night . it also happen afternoon if you taking picture sun example . basically same rule above , how bright light source compared surrounding area , you move sun center photo near side internal reflection move side/dissapear ( also depending angle ) . but best way just remove filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you reduce occurence internal reflection identifying correctly when internal reflection occur then remove filter during those situation ( which not hard ) . i'm actually not fan lens filter ( any filter ) i think it only degrade picture quality we added layer sensor object , but i decided use them anyway all my lens . i would recommend everyone get one this filter if you don't any filter your lens yet .	1
haven't used it lot ... but so far ... easy use ... works low light ... decent sound ... great video ..	1
i decided since i no expertise cameras , i needed one my new job , i would go factory refurbished one . so far this camera everything i could possibly want . good battery life nimh rechargeable batteries , great clear pix , easy use . lcd came some minor scratches , but i guess refurb thats expected . i like this camera also because it viewfinder which lot new cameras not . i would recommend this camera anyone who looking easy use well made , inexpensive camera work	1
my nephew thrilled recieve this graduation . he took it his trip spain got great pictures . good camera price	1
i camera 2 years all all it exceptional camera its many advanced features . designers must felt because wide range f-stops , very slow/fast shutter ( 3sec 1/2000 ) fantastic film speed range ( auto or iso 80 800 ) , why large flash . e550 designed available light camera . true flash only works when autofocus autorange feature work . it must see something well or you get no flash . somethings i like unlimited movie time . ( card limited ) almost none existant shutter delay very unusual digital camera . while driving i pick up camera , turn it shoot one hand shot deer side highway . i just preset it speed prioity shutter , preset 1/800 or 1/1000 . dial top you set priority amperture , speed manual or program all . i also like feature automatic exposure bracketing . also rapid shooting feature get object moving . also i like feature prefocus ( pressing shutter half way down)then waiting instant shot . what worked alaska get whale which only instant surface . it very capable camera well ' point shot ' . i taken 3000 photos it . it great camera but if not set correctly you may not get good picture	1
large sharp photos amd mp3 player cool too	1
this digital photo frame reasonably good picture quality once set up , used anyone selected mode . i it set slide presentation mode people enjoy looking it . i could easily see giving it , already set up , people who not computer savvy , such grandparents . give them new pictures , send new card they slip . said , cost still fairly high buttons top frame useless unless you them memorized or really good vision . i would recommend this product	1
i purchased this camera 6 months ago . so far so good . this my 4th digital camera 5 years ( i take 20-200 photos week ) . i started canon digital elph 2mp . right before my year warranty up , door compact flash card broke off zoom sticking times - but they couldn't duplicate stick so they just fixed door . 6 months later zoom wore out . i drop it several times , someone bumped into me beer it got little wet . besides sticky zoom , camera still works but i need more megapixels . then i bought 4 mp elph it lasted 2 1/2 years before button broke ( switch viewing photos taking photos ) . then friend talked me into casio because longer battery life , big screen he showed me great photos he took his . so i switched casio - big mistake . i enjoyed long batter life big screen but flash week lot photos i took dark dance clubs horrid . casio lasted 6 months before zoom got stuck when i bumped it - not covered warranty . i switched back canon but i wanted something more control , more manual functions . so canon s80 seemed like best match . it little bigger than what i'm use but quality photos makes up it . video amazing - it great you take small videos , easy enough email - or high quality video - better than any camcorder i've owned . definetly get 1 gig card , especially if you want use high quality video . so far camera pretty solid - no problems all i think bigger size easier hold onto . my only complaint dial switch modes moves too easily . if i camera setting i need night , i'll camera , waiting right moment take photo . while i'm holding camera , i accidently touch wheel my thumb change my setting without knowing it . then when i go take photo , i miss perfect moment because setting wrong . that my only complaint - if it wasn't i'd give this camera 5 stars	1
tried it indoor outdoor .. it works fine .. dual voltage charger added advantage too .. works great good starter camcorder .	1
this camcorder great little camera easy operate . lcd clear colors crisp . needed buttons easy access . it lightweight fits nicely palm your hand .	1
i got digital keychain my wife , so she could carry pictures our 3 grandchildren . i download mac software tao website load photos , but everything then went pretty smoothly . my wife really likes resul t.t he hardware gets 5 stars - it works advertised , photos look pretty good very small screen . software gets 3 1/2 stars . it crashed once , but since then it stable . it good job letting me crop pictures ( which important , since only closeups useful small lcd screen ) . it took some trial error find out best way use software : 1 . select each desired photo , edit it add " collection " . 2 . transfer collection keycain . 3 . save collection file . 4 . when you later want add more photos , not open old collection . just start aother collection add new photos . then transfer additional photos keychain . if you add photos original collection , then transfer , you wll end up two copies your original photos keychain	1
great gift idea . easy download pictures use afterwards . just use close up shots able view them easier	1

this item received promptly well packaged . item works fine quality item . excellent service	1
i bought this well other lenmar batteries . i own lenmar equivalent sony camcorder battery , two other different canon camera equivalents , now i'm getting nb-4l nb-5l well lenmar . i don't doubt lenmar . batteries i bought three years ago still performing flawlessly , while canon caught up them capacity ( yes , lenmar batteries used more capacity than canon branded ones ) they still high quality charging cameras ' oem chargers without any problems . they cost third half cost canon sony branded equivalents . lenmar i got my s400 digital elph actually outlasted canon battery , though i used them alternately lenmar more mah than canon . i've more quality warranty issues ( though resolved ) canon than i've lenmar , so me lenmar deserves all five stars	1
just bought this my sony hdr-hc1 , battery big , but it balances camera better than standard battery . i think sony designed camera little heavy front make this battery balance camera so well . price seems steep but it less than buying three standard batteries , it replaces . great buy my book ! buy two so you always one charged ready go . you run out tape before ypu run out battery	1

i've wanted purchase pair binoculars couple years , but kept putting it off because i figured i'd dump least $300 quality pair . i wanted something compact , good quality , affordable . not exactly easy order . but after reading reviews these bins , i figured i'd give them try . all i say wow . these exactly what i looking . they provide very crisp image lower magnification levels . even 24x , although usually impractical , they lot fun . i find it easy focus change zoom level one hand which plus . general purpose viewing , these fantastic binoculars . bins shipped black velcro-flap carrying case belt loop back , small carrying strap you attach your bins	1
i ordered these binoculars my husband birthday . they arrived promptly excellent condition ; well packed . we both surprised how powerful they easy use , wow ! very , very pleased . they very light weight ( nice these old arthritic arms hands ) . only possible drawback they not waterproof need kept dry all times , so dh not able take them fishing trips unless he double zipper lock bags them .	1
i really like case . its stylish well made . sort looks like prada . unfortunately panasonic doesn't anything like it . so i bought canon . it fits f07 maybe little snugly , but thats ok me . i like easy magnetic closure stylish red strap silver accent . panasonic please make stylish case like this one your products	1
since it leather , you put some pressure camera push it case it stretched perfectly 1-2 days allow sd700 fit still snap clasp . fits ' like glove ' which maintains beauty small camera yet still case .	1
this first electronic gadget i bought years i able figure out minutes ! out box , after 2 hour charge ( gave me chance watch tutorial scan manual ) i wasmaking movies ! i not used high quality setting yet but mid-range pretty darn good ! most impressive feature its " anti jitter " filtering . any other camcorder i ever tried makes mymovies look like i am middle earthquake ! not this one ! ( unless you max zoom ) theoptical zoom far more than needed so i never expect even use digital zoom . there " easy " mode automatically sets camera adequate settings . it actually works . only thing i am problems getting camera connect pc . camera says " connecting " just hangs . i call sony report back . i suspect better editingsoftware cure . software provided very basic . workaround now just insert dvd directly into pc then use software read edit it . it would nice if you could " finalize " dvd pc rather than camcorder . initialy , i purchased camcorder alone see how i like it but i just ordered all options	1
i love this camcorder . it simple use i love fact you just hit one buttom it formats disc then it ready go into your dvd player . it all right features , but not so many you'll never use them all . i love clear , precise focus night shot option filming indoors outdoors . i've this product 3 months now , i've completed one disc i'm very satisfied it performance	1
i am no way computer geek , i no idea what optical zoom finalizing disc meant . but i am mom wanted quality home videos my girls wanted spend less than $450 . so here my opinion . i returned my samsung 164 this camera . it same price but this super niteshot . camera very light easy control one hand . lens made glass versus samsung which made plastic . zoom amazing this camera , i stood across my kitchen able zoom small print my calendar , amazing ! i am so glad i took samsung 164 back - indoor quality camera horrible . this excellent even low light situations . very pleased . i also able record dvd -r which not require formatting - just put disc record . oh finalizing just when you recording you go menu camcorder press finalize it 1 minute it says it complete your . not complicated i thought it would	1
i purchased aiptek mpvr use twenty20 helmet cam while riding motorcycles offroad . it serves purpose very well . video quality dependent helmet cam , mpvr only acting recording device . unit light , compact not subject mechanical failures occur tape or disk based recorders . since it records sd memory cards , it easy delete files free up space there no need cables transfer files computer . it uses standard nokia 8210 batteries , which last 1 hour recording . 1 gigabyte sd card holds 45 minutes video . you also use mpvr camcorder or camera , although it somewhat limited because its fixed focus lack zoom . price , i feel it great product	1
rocks !!! i used it take video our band dark basement , it it worked great . i wanted cheap video camera i could thrash around little bit , this one went above beyond . features it great , battery lasts , all you need , least 512mb sd card . only thing i found needs work nightshot . if your video taping some thing thats moving(a band normally moves quite bit ) it makes everything fuzzy , really ruin video . this great video camera , i would buy it if it costs twice much	1
i've using this carrier carry around my sony cybershot camera . it fits perfectly it ( snug .... no wiggling ) . camera i'm using sony dsc-t100 . i've very pleased it . i carry it my belt . only reason 4 stars out 5 catch flap holds camera . it magnetic holder sometimes pull loose ( putting seatbelt car , etc . ) . i think regular snap might little easier . but even small difficulty , it worked very well i'm well pleased it . it sturdy protect camera . i would recommend it anyone .	1

this not high-tech digital frame . it doesn't play mp3 . it doesn't come remote . it simply reads your digital pictures card displays them slide show mode . there " " button " off " button . there no manual read order learn how operate your frame ( though it come one-page instruction sheet ) . it great your office desk when all you need reach over turn it or off . if you want display it difficul t-t o-reach location , or choreograph your pictures music , then this not frame you	1

not lenmar brand but very good long lasting praction panasonic oem battery . very satisfie	1
i expecting get lenmar brand shown website but instead received accesory power brand , however , i satisfied battery . it rated 800mah vs 680mah panaonic battery . it fits my fz5 charger well oem battery it seems last longer	1
i like this lens . i use it landscape photography . i find images i take sharp , vr works nicely . telephoto lens , it bigger than my wide-angle lenses heavier ( 5 pounds ) . definitely workout when i am hiking	1
yes , without doubt this lens worth price . i not used it film but i couldn't happier how it performs my digital d200 . there reason pro use lenses manufacturer their cameras . same reason these lenses cost more ! quality , durability performance ! when you hook this lens up new camera technology performance quick responsive . yes , autofocus hunt times , usually you focus first time . it easy switch manual focus also slightly adjusted manually during exposure lock . images crisp colors superb ! personally i like weight substantial feel this lens . when extended full zoom balance not quite nice but certainly manageable me . i am over 6ft tall could see where someone smaller size would find this lens heavy . far i am concerned size weight they should quality lens this range . build quality very good ! controls right place quickly become intuitive . i disagree other complaints regards tripod collar . one came my camera fits tightly securely . it also removes very easily since it heavy weight reduction noticeable . this lens comes very rugged pouch strap well front rear caps lens shade . lens shade big ! suffice it say if you using lens shade this lens it looks like something sidelines nfl game . bottom line this my favorite lens ! i thought long hard getting 70-200mm afs 80-200afs nikkor lenses . not day goes i haven't glad i put my money towards this lens it much bigger zoom range . remember 1.5 factor when using digital sensor . good luck	1
what amazed me soon i opened box how small this camcorder size woman hand . it came complete tripod stand , carrying strap , carrying case , software cd , cables even batteries . software easy install all you need viewing editing your pictures or video . viewing area this camcorder small(like product itself ) but surprisingly easy view . it comes 4x zoom you see believe . there both manual auto focus camera well settings indoors , outdoors low light . cam comes built light remarkable job such small cam . pictures video great 1 gig card you all room you could possibly need . features this so numerous i not list them all . following instruction manual best way learn how use this cam properly . it comes both full manual quick use guide . trying " wing " it possible because this camera so easy use but you likely miss out many great functions available . everyone i shown this product amazed quality cam low price . this one great deal i suggest impossible pass up . many digital camera much more money only take clips not capture better pictures than this cam . summary i highly recommend this camcorder , you not go wrong it :	1

sony hvr-a1u cmos high definition camcorder 10x optical zoom performs advertised . it very versatile answer user various demands it . when high definition dvd recorders ( blu-ray or hd dvd ) become standardized widely available , i expect this technology norm . pictures hi-def wonderful	1

i market hd camera best price . i looked into canon hv-10 which priced 1000 dollars which hd quality . i compared this camera baseline . online i read panasonic pv-gs320 which upgraded model gs300 released early 2006 . this camera 3ccd , what mean ? each ccd processing chip allows image display it best . how you test this ? go your local best buy or compusa where they this camera . 1 ccd camera zoom 25-30x digital zoom . you start see blurry . same gx320 you see much clearer crisp image . you notice difference right away .	1
amazon updated info this case incorrectly . this acc-dvdp case dvd 203/403 mini dvd camcorders . i mean , this perfect case camera . camera fits into palm your hand case goes right around it space your batteries mini dvd . entire world tell this case made just your camcorder . --- note : don't buy it dvd 7 listed product info . they wrong camcorder listed . this mini dvd 203/403 camcorders !!	1
others mentioned , autofocus little slow sometimes won't focus all really low light . but you should manual focusing anyways . other than this great lense , especially less than 200 dollars . i've used it photographing motocross surfing so far . 300mm good getting close up surfers while standing beach . colors crisp this lense seems little sharper than 28-80mm nikkor came my d50	1
don't fooled what people say this item . they say things break using it or just fall off this product . so where i begin , well first off i could not more happy this product then i already am . i got this nice box opened it right away . first thing i noticed its size . it nice small thats way it should . however when i saw how small it compared what i originally thought , i worried video quality . then onced i recorded things different lighted areas , i found it great quaslity . one problem i found when it dark , this camera deos not so well dark . it just lowers quality video . so after trying it out i confused little how work it but i found out how use it right away . i bought 10 dollar 1g memory card it they work perfectly together . clip lens protector little unsatisfieing but it good short term . i not tried mp3 player because i not buy this camera , however i try voice recorder . everything works great pictures videos voice recorder . this camera also nice small features like changing formats things you record , all those little things . one-hundred dollars this must buy . this camera perfect if your looking compatibility , recording movies . believe it or not if you record 30 fps 1gb card you record one hour thirty minutes . pros : -price ( camcorder 100$ however buy 10$ gb card because not all cards go into this camera , believe me its worth money . card cheap works perfectly camera . )-quality ( good quality such small thing you chose different frame rates . )- 5.1 megapixels ( this good cameras , some expensive cameras might not even this . )-memory ( card this good amount memory allow you film least hour . )-cables programs ( cd comes camera install some programs save things you took onto your computer , if you don't anything already . )-compatibility ( nice light weight camera . )-included carrying case ( comes carrying case protect your camera even more . ) cons :-( confusing use first , it possible delete thigs without you knowing what you doing , however everything explained manual . )-clip lens protector ( it kinda bad after while , because it deos losen , however camera comes carrying case anyway so thats good . )-memory ( built memory not good all , so buy card or you won't enjoy this camera . ) anyway this camera perfect filming those little moments your life , like vacations or other things like . you easily tuck it somewhere where it won't bother you . however if you want perfect quality you won't find here . this camera deos great quality but its not perfec t.t his product most likely you love or hate , however i really loved it	1
i am amazed complaining $150 camera/camcorder . when you buy one these , don't expect it like $900 ones ! i taken several pictures clear high quality . camcorder exactly what i want it i am extremely pleased this unit . dxg something here help us all , but they not perfect . this unit exactly what i wanted i recommend it anyone market camera camcorder easy pocketbook	1
first off , this awesome camera price . there no other camera same price range which deliver this much performance quality money . those who talk low-light quality needs go out purchase themselves hotshoe light . who their right mind would shoot 15 , 30 or even 60 lux without external light anyway ? picture quality greatly hampered . i believe next spare battery , external light source probably most valuable accessory you own . this camera comes loaded all standard features other camcorders this price range also remote control included , which some competitors not standard . top , 3 ccd sensors !!! simply put , you not find better camcorder price ! period .	1
i bought hc96 replace my five year old trv11 which sony top line consumer model time . after using hc96 one week , i following observations . 1 ) camacorder charger much smaller than trv11 . build quality seems decent . i don't like docking station design , but it not show stopper . 2 ) video quality door/out door shooting only slightly better than trv11 despite great reviews i read internet . widescreen nice new feature compared trv 11.3 ) focusing under low night bit slow , i really wish manual focus ring when taking my daughter christmas stage performance . potential shopper should also check out gs500 which close competition	1
i received this camera gift few years ago i ended up falling love photography because it . it great beginners because it not expensive ... obviously what camera lacks megapixels zoom what you save dollars . but i taken hundreds gorgeous photos . it extremely user-friendly , unlike hps i've used , action shots never problem . just note you can't zoom while shooting movies ( mpeg ) but it pick up sound cleanly . i also found it very durable ... it dropped countless times , used outside during ( wisconsin ) winter , exposed both water sand but picture quality hasn't decreased . ( make sure you get case it- it doesn't come one but they're cheap . ) i'm now looking into freelance photography career , but until i save up enough one those fancy $ 700 deals , this one definitely get me through	1
kind people just want record life precious moments , this camera you . recording quality so-so suffers mildly low-light situations , this goes photos well . i find this camera very neat , it extremely light weight easy use . however , this my first dv camcorder , i yet figure out how transfer video tape computer . until then , my 1 gigabyte memory card trick . all-in-all , i recommend this camcorder anyone something small , yet simple use . it great use outdoors , well indoors , long lighting plenty	1
very compact great mini dv incredible price . my old sony died got this fraction price i paid sony	1
i've working professional photographer cinematographer over 10 years ; i tons exp . every kind camera market past present this camera i love carry me when i'm out . its slimmer then my cell phone , smaller than my wallet , rugged enough carried my most every day week . i've my over year now little zero problems it . t7 reacts fast changing environments distances . i underwater housing camera which i use weekly basis filming surfing videos images . this camera also special function i yet see work well camera , burst multi-burst functions . i captured 30 or so images split second thanks this function or switch it capture every 1/4 second 8 seconds . it ideal function fast action photography or sports photographer their day off . i highly recommend this camera anyone novice professional because its ease use adaptability situation . only thing i would ask canon would make their newest version camera just like this one add shockproof waterproof housing this awesome camera	1
i bought this camera my girlfriend , but i love it so much i always ask borrow it . i think it takes great pictures if you use tips manual , it works great almost every situation . i wish it casing made protective coating or special cover because it gets scratched very easily . i no problems it over year since purchased .	1
i love my camera . here why : 1 . pop-out screen . perfect when you crowd . you just tilt screen , rais your arms you know what you'll shooting . ( rather than just shooting blindly . ) also , get kids/pet shots . you tilt screen up you shoot your waist or knees without bend uncomfortably . con : it probably makes camera bit chunkier , but me it worth it . 2 . pixel size . it around 5mp it just right all-around shooting . it isn't too small where i lose details but it isn't too big where i'm always free up space my computer . con : i would prefer more mp but , this camera , it fine . 3 . controls . i found it simple enough all-around ' point shoot ' shots but it also features you control . i choose use my manual shutter aperture settings control my pictures . but if i hand my camera somebody who no idea how use one , they could just hit button shoot . con : settings seem overwhelm beginner ... first , but after reading manual bit , it should help . 4 . size . i am comfortable it size . but i know many would prefer smaller one . ( i guess would con it . ) it feels solid well made . screen not too small lense decent job getting shots you want . i use cushioned carrying case it it bit bulky but i'd rather protect it something like . this bit chunky your pocket but it still fit . ( don't forget grab yourself camera strap added protection against drops ! )5 . canon . i've owned canons while brand i stick . i found they well made cameras awesome . this one favorite . i take it anywhere . hopefully you too . enjoy	1
this excellent tripod sony video camera . i am using this my sony camcorder remote working pretty good . its legs strong . i am using same my nikon d50 ( remote not usable ) . i am satisfied performance . only one issue base where you attach camera plastic . so sometimes i am not comfortable my dslr its zoom len	1
i found this tripod sony website , but bit put off price , both there , circuit city . i thrilled find it much less amazon !!! tripod itself super ... we mostly shoot video our baby home , so we don't need anything too sophisticated . we love controls arm tripod , bubble-level thing good feature . highly recommend	1
this tripod simply amazing . it light-weighted enough ( 1.3 kg or 2 lbs 14 oz ) you would not feel burdened all when you take it out hiking . moreover , it works other types cameras instead limiting it sony products exclusively . i tried my 5 years old olympus 2020 digital camera it stayed there rock-solid . keep mind , however , attached remote only works sony-branded cameras/camcorders since remote requires you plug cable into equipment you intend use . i also try my newly bought sony camcorder mini-dv dcr-hc42 it worked flawlessly . included air bubble ingenious device it allows you see whether tripod level respect floor . thus , even if floor uneven , you always find best balanced spot looking air bubble that directly beneath tripod center leg . like reviewer said , this tripod gives user almost unlimited control you rotate it any angle you want , range 19 - 57 inches ( or 48 -145 cm ) , it almost satisfy any kind everyday use . finally , it great buy amazon because most people ebay selling roughly same price , minus great return policy amazon . i would absolutely recommend this tripod anyone who needs it any purpose .	1
i am just average guy when it comes using camera . probably below average . i started trying use 100% sony electronic products because my computer sony sony-sony linkages make easy use . given , here what i think product : 1 . it amazing how much camera you get money . compared just 6 months ago , or year ago , this lot camera money . it very small , fits easily your pocket , but takes great pictures . also , it very easy use recharge . 2 . visit sony website , suggests sony new cameras coming out constantly -- new cameras very similar . this makes it hard compare cameras , even within sony brand , makes you feel if your camera obsolete minute you buy it . 3 . problem this camera , given it so small -- not shake . your pictures blurry . i am typical guy , very little fine motor control . my hands trouble holding small objects . holding this camera one hand taking picture -- well results not pleasant . 4 . i tend disappointed telephoto capabilities these small cameras . i guess if you really want zoom , then you go big camera . but it still seems like small cameras could offer more . 5 . said all , end , this camera small easy carry , light weight , durable , it also easy use . when you look it , it looks well made . i ended up giving camera my in-laws , because they lost theirs . my in-laws tend technologically challenged . i said them , just leave dial set little green camera , snap away . i say - they love this camera . overall . money , great purchase , technology amazing . just grab it two hands or develop steadier aim than i .	1
befores this camera i cybershot user ; since i believe this camera great characteristics : good flash level take close pictures , several especialized modes , compact size 10x zoom , great outdoors pictures ( vivids colorfuls ) . my main complain software : i not choose diferent flash intensity levels ( shots not well iluminated indoors really poor)and i not choose iso mode ( avoid bad pictures objects moving ) . besides night shots mode not good i expected . my general opinion this camera could really better if software would more versatile	1

i bought this camera because i unhappy my 3.5 megapixel one produced grainy pictures . i am so happy i . c875 very easy use ( even beginner like me ) produces crisp , superb photos . you take one photo after without wait too long shots . i recently shared my pics when i got back vacation i got lot comments how clear sharp pictures how vibrant colors . i can't believe i got such great camera under $200 .	1

therre many camcorders market many superior this one . however you pay much more money , this price range it wouldbe impossible find better camcorder . easy use powerful zoom ( better more powerfull more expensive camcorders ) connects easily mac or pc it offerssomething similar camcorders not : possibility set your manual settings ( if you wish so ) experiment . users ewant it simple , auto settings deliver you excellent result . again if you want something more than you should look elsewhere pay more . but price this best bu	1
well i paid $330 this year ago . i thinks its best camcorder value . image quality excellent well lit conditions . if you shooting dim light i would suggest use auxillary light . i wish camcorder came shoe light attachment . there lot manual controls if used properly improve picture quality lot dim conditions . joy stick control easy use settings changed one hand . all all its very good camcorder . few tips get most out this one . - use auxillary light dim conditions . - make sure not record directly into bright light . - buy extra capacity battery	1
after researching several cameras this price range , i bought rebel t2 last month . it met my expectations perhaps then some . after recently trying out friends camera 150 . -ish range , i partially regret spending what i . it all comes down what you need , want , how many bells whistles you like . money though , compared competitors , i still think i made good purchase . after all , if i use it ten years , which i most likely , i surely got my moneys worth . bottom line : no complaints it	1
i recently started small photography business doing black white shots kids their natural environment . i wanted camera took quality shots , but still cost effective . i most definitely found it . my cannon takes great shots allows me mobility needed chase kids around . very pleased .	1
i really like this camera it current price it hard beat . there lot said already but i think what it boils down when choosing f20 f30 - you want pay more " dial " - more later . pros ( order importance me)1 . excellent low light shots ! i cannot emphasize this enough . but please don't compare it dslr - that simply not fair . i compared it canon sd700 - i carried both testing took identical shots . fuji outperforms canon hands down this department . fuji took clear shots inside libraries museums using natural light which specifically what i wanted . canon produced photos natural light grainy blurry . i prefer use natural lighting much i so this probably most important factor me . 2 . out box simplicity . i read somewhere someone saying this not good ps . i not agree . my so visiting dc baltimore area i debated which camera give him - canon or fuji . this most un-technical person i know - he still trouble whole " holding shutter halfway down focus " digital cameras . however , knowing he would museums , memorials , etc , i gave him fuji made sure after i played it , it all set back auto . he came back beautiful clear shots ! far nicer then anything he able achieve previous digital cameras . most indoor photos used natural light his flash outdoor photos came out great - all set auto . 3 . nice size solid construction . this not " plastic " camera like couple others we our house cost nearly same . it metal feels solid your hands . it not compact others ( like canon sd700 ) but actually me , it better . i don't big hands all , but some smaller cameras just too small even me . it small enough pocket or purse . 4 . lots scene selections when you want experiment . this camera gives you lot pseudo-manual controls play but not like slr where you adjust shutter/aperture . it gives you enough experiment manipulate . read specs - i won't go into them all here except say natural/flash mode genius ! which leads me cons1 . nearly everything menu driven . i find this cumbersome times . i think i would happier f30 . but i new fuji didn't want sink much money into camera brand i unfamiliar so c'est la vie . here example how it annoyed me : we're forest i've gone thru menus select macro setting - minimum 6 clicks menu system . i am taking closeups some foliage when behind me , my golden retriever something comical i would loved take picture , but i don't even try shot knowing macro mode , there little hope good outcome it would take too long get it back auto mode using menu system . canon , i could quickly moved external dial auto tried shot . i know this bit extreme example but i wanted share it knowing lot you , like myself , want experiment scene selections but also use auto . if you think you're going use auto most time , then it probably little consequence you . but you may want consider f30 this reason . now there * * button back called f-mode which there allow you make some quick settings changes . it basically smaller selection menu which means you'd get your settings quicker , but what fuji chose place this shorter selection menu befuddling me . i see value iso setting there but honestly , other two settings ( imo ) dumb . picture quality ( choosing normal , fine , few others ) something i usually set once forget . this belongs only longer more tedious menu selection . same other selection - finepix color where you choose normal , chroma , bw . if i'm setting those i'm thinking shots - they don't need " quick pick " menu . i think fuji should replace one those quick pick setting puts camera all auto mode . maybe i just haven't found way it - if there simple fast way get into auto mode , then someone please tell me . one few external buttons anti-blur button it very handy . 2 . like everyone else - i dislike charging system . you purchase standalone charger however . 3 . xd card - everything else i life takes sd cards . my card reader doesn't read xd . mild annoyance . 4 . i don't particularly like slow zooming when playback mode . 5 . slower then other camaeras when deleting photos camera formatting card . rest - lcd quality , no optical viewfinder ( canon one but it so tiny it hardly worth it ) battery life , zoom , macro mode all good enough - not spectacular f20 , but not bad either . they really weren't much factor my buying decision . all all - i really like this camera use it lot . there some annoying quirks but they simply don't overshadow wonderful photos it produces - especially low light when compared other compact cameras .	1
i call cameras like this phd ( push here dummy ) because i not work camera more than simplest systems . this camera works great me . very compact light good battery life . it works low light bright image stabilization work well i get nice sharp pictures now . display back nice large given small size camera . image display clear bright even brightest light outside . i wish there docking station like i fuji finepix f410 . it great gizmo made charging camera down loading pictures very easybuy it enjoy it if you like me , overwhelmed complicated gizmos , this simple straight forward camera use .	1
this nice carrying case , magnetic closure makes it easy get camera out . belt loop snap closure which sometimes pop other cases i've used , but i not problem this case yet	1
i bought this rangefinder golf , but thought it might also work hunting . it small enough i keep it my pocket pull it out when needed . i tried it heavy brush , but find mixed results close range . you get good results objects beyond 50 yards utilizing " ignore close objects " function . i pulled it out rifle range today during snow shower pleasantly surprised get reading 101 yards my target bench 1 yard back firing line . snow not affect results rangefinder all ... probably more effect bullet path	1
this rangefinder great ! much lighter than big bulky other units . all great features needed . this one you take you not leave truck because it too big . i tested this against some my buddies ' bigger units known distances this one out bigger units speed accuracy . great scan mode . best buy . should sold ($) more than asked	1
bought this go canon 350xt we bought our father law . it perfect kit beginner quality products good .	1
great camera many useful features . no usb cable included however which led 4 week chase no results yet amazon , nikon , or cameta camera , supplier . poor followup this case . now i understand nikon no longer supplies this cable .	1
i purchased this camera before our trip hawaii , not repented ... it delivers clear photos , very flexible set pre-programmed settings ... must purchase folks move	1
this camera everything it says ; yes , it waterproof i very uneasy taking digital camera into water first time !! only reason i didn't give it 5 stars : it slow every other digital camera i've owned far focusing , multiple flashes , then actually shooting . you get your subject attention they smile , frozen , you hold down shutter release good 3 seconds until shot taken ( low light . ) i especially intrigued its " bright capture " technology , but it honestly doesn't seem any different low light than my old sony u20 2mp tiny little snapshot camera . still same flash-in-the-dark look . there fill-flash low light program mode ( among many many others ) , but shutter speed sets itself so slow background becomes messy worthless blob , even if you hold your breath try remain still . my ideal snapshot camera portable , durable , quick , easy , produces excellent results without think your exposure modes . this camera 3.5 out those 5 . it way portable , very durable , easy , produces ok results but you mess settings if you're not daylight , it not very quick . overall i am very happy purchase carry it everywhere	1
excellent , light weight professional looking camera . haven't used it long enough so it take some time able master it full capabilities . i used like idea removable lens , but fuji finepix fixed lens , it really doesn't matter much , there additional lens attached it .	1
this very good camera , it certainly let you lot creative work . downside , pics sometimes little dull . i found after i bought it same money i could bought konica dimage a200 optical stabilization syste	1

it long time since i used tripod but i managed get it set up without reading instructions . there no instructions so save box helpful hints . tripod fit my purpose : mostly indoor use planned . it hard get it truely static when pressing shutter release minolta dimage . i also horizontally challenged - base little level below ( below ) camera pad . i would not take this rugged outdoor adventure many uneven surfaces ( they need make titaniium one get it this light but durable ; start saving now . ) i would not use it around kids , old folks , crowds , or any combination these because your expensive electonic gizmo going going fly thru air greatest ease . nylon or tyvek travel case would helpful item	1
this nice quality built bag . i love detachable lower compartment which i use store extra video cables minidv tapes . my camcorder small fits snuggly , so if your camera any bigger or you leave tripod attachment -- beware it may not fit . i would like little more room , but overall i'm happy purchase	1
i recently purchased this camera when my venerable nikormat el-w developed shutter timing issues during my photo 1 class . this camera reasonably priced preformed flawlessly thus far . i shot multiple rolls ilford hp5 plus film through this camera yet exposure not come out due camera . after reading manual i able easily understand different modes how change user controlled settings . camera flash leaves little desired it rather harsh its range somewhat limited , accessory flash overcome this there other flashes operate this camera not just canon . i not opportunity shooting color film through this camera yet when i i update this review . only thing i dislike this camera there no provision remote shutter release . rebel k2 date only version this camera use remote shutter release , why canon removed this feature this model unknown remote release very handy when photographing nature or when used timer self portraits . if you any plans infrared photography not buy eos canon , frame counter uses infrared sensor cause fogging your infrared film	1
i am really satisfied purchase this camera . good quality workmanship . canon leader photography my book . easy use controls any one	1
this great little camera . we olympus 3.2 meg still camera 10 time optic zoom it great camera although it little slow focus small lcd . this panasonic real fast still camera much larger lcd it also 10 time optic zoomand doubles video camera record dvd . it real easy use we love it . what more could you want ? amazon great price you trust them	1
i using mine 2 months now . picture quality very good . i purchased sima light add . it enhances pictures even better . still pictures amazing too . i trying decide sony this one . finally decided this one because picture quality .	1
this first 5 star rating i ever given amazon ! i chose hv20 preparation week long shoot north south india . i ready purchase new panasonic hvx200 ( approximately $ 5,000 ); but $ 1,100 hv20 camera actually some major advantages convinced me it better choice my project . biggest factor my choice hv20 editing capability . hv20 hdv format compatible editing packages like adobe premier pro , whereas formats recorded ( i.e. avhcd or hd50 ) other products panasonic sony not very compatible editing packages may impossible or require extra steps post processing . regarding image quality , camera earns wow ! i think this camera currently very best option solo shoot go . other reviews say it all regarding image quality , color , etc . external hot shoe audio also big deal high quality shooting . lcd screen sharp feature impose horizontal line or grid screen ( but not recorded ) very handy maintain level shots . camera not tiny , but small enough slipped into very large trouser pocket ; this allowed access more spontaneous shooting opportunities than larger hd camera options . large fanny pack , i kept camera ( extra tapes , batteries , monopod , dm50 microphone ) me all times ready anything . this portability factor transcends price point . regarding storage , hv20 records hdv directly dv tape . much more expensive hvx200 record hd50 format ( which equivalent or possibly superior format ) but only record sd ( not hd ) tape ; hxv200 , proprietary p2 cards required hd recording ( 8gb p2 card costs approximately $ 1,100 ) . i bought this camera price one 8gb p2 card ! recording tape seemed like disadvantage first , but advantage india huge - i not need transfer anything my pc or need pc ) until i good ready ( so i could maximize shooting time site deal all post production later ); addition , archival handled up front less compression no spaces constraints - more tapes could not solve ; after shooting 10 tapes , i realized this also significant advantage . i also took over 1,000 3.1 megapixel still shots camera 2gb card . camera layout quite good . tape battery swapped out without removing tripod or monopod mount . unplanned situations , this major advantage . few ways camera could improved : 1 ) lens width varies when switching video still modes , so i expect editing stills into my video take extra time2 ) after market wide angle lens , wide shot shows black edges lens , settable zoom stop would help when zooming back wide . 3 ) manual focus not intuitive , more feedback dial would help4 ) switching auto programmable mode would better if some auto functions could set stay 5 ) auto backlight feature would handy6 ) minisd card strange inconvenient choice still photo storage , since i could not reuse sd cards i already own ( note no memory card included camera ) 7 ) video input ( like samsung product ) , so i could keep camera my pocket shoot lipstick cam when necessary ( avoid looking like typical american tourist or action/sports applications)8 ) battery life shorter than expected , i got 1 hour each battery . net net , this camera fantastic i believe video quality sufficent qualify my project my first film festival submission	1
i sony fx1 since 2 years then i bought sony hc1 which i return due unacceptable video noise low light conditions . when you used sony fx1 you know how low light videos supposed look , so i something good compare hv20 . i got this hv20 camera i played it checking its potential outdoor indoors . i switched 24p 1080i same shot same lighting conditions see 24p really make video cleaner low light , it way better than sony hc1 which i bought . course sony fx1 low light footage much better than hv20 , but using 24p low light make hv20 acceptable . i could not really make out difference fx ! hv20 bright daytime videos other than hv20 more color saturation . my fears laid rest i like hv20 low light daylight videos . 1/3rd price sony fx1 this camera keeper . 24p something which some people like some wont . action or movement objects appear little jerky 24p which expected , but it look different 1080i . non moving shots 24p looks great . if you pan camera 24p mode video stutter pretty apparen t.t o give you idea what 24p looks like imagine watching video monitor which low refresh rate you see ghost object follow object after it moves . i took camera drove around night see how it handles nightlights ... 24p mode not something you would use situation whenever you pan camera blurring effect becomes very pronounced due lights . but still video pretty good . 24p mode cinema effect added makes it little bit better . 1080i mode looks pretty good without 24p motion blur while i took drive . i connected hv20 my 42inch 1080p lcd tv through hdmi it looks really good . i surprised . outdoor videos very sharp colorful . indoor videos also pretty good . more saturated colors than sony fx1 but very nice look . it difficult get steady shots camera it lighter . if you keep you hand steady during shots footage good hd channels . but it great take it disney or vacations without carry sony fx1 bulk . it neat little timer which displays 10secs when you start record so you not make shot too short or too abrupt . battery life little more than hour lcd open so i bought extra bp-2l14 battery . hopefully they come out great fx1 low light performance such small package soon . overall this very good buy . you love playing 24p mode . conclusions .. very light , pretty fast auto focusing , small form factor , 24p mode video , good low light videos , really great daytime videos wife loves this camera it much smaller than fx1 !	1
my fuji camera " only " take fuji brand batteries - it not take anything else comparable so i rate this excellent .	1
worked advertised right out box . would buy family well	1
this item terrific its intended purpose - small reminders good memories you carry you . other reviews indicated , though , not expect awesome picture quality . sentimental value not diminished , though	1
some times there problems getting dvd finalize especially if you let battery run down . run time battery only 20 minutes max , prepared purchase additional batteries	1
this good camera money ...... i use 35mm times instead my digital ... this great price	1
one reasons i bought this camera description power source : " requires two aa batteries -- included " . i sick buying expensive cells camera store , i always sleeve aa batts around house . sounded great . oops ! when camera arrived i opened battery door , there nothing inside , when i checked manual i learned no aa need apply . back camera store ! ten bucks pair lithium cells . battery , says manual , should good ten rolls film . so add lifetime cost camera . it neat little camera , i'm not planning return it . but i wee bit disappointed	1
targus dpmv02 pro series video/photo backpack . i put both my digital cameras , all my lenses , flashes , my mp3 player . padded sections keep everything getting scratched everything else . it also keeps everything nice neat . pack looks small but it held all my stuff ease . padded dividers also keep it very quit which great cause i take lot wildlife photos . pack isn't small but it compact it stays high my back when i'm walking through tall brush . also it smooth so i'm not snagging it all time things . :) it convenient cell phone pocket you situate bunch places straps . only thing i found it lacking spot my tripod or bag	1
i needed lens adapter my kodak p712 . this one fit bill price right . fits like glove my telephoto lens . great price , fast delivery . very happy	1
this must cable if you're going transfer your videos your computer . sony not supply cable its hd camcorders . if you edit your videos and/or make dvds , you need this cable	1
i needed extra battery my kodak p880 . this battery recommended kodak . it works like charm . i like 2 batterys , i never worry my camera dying . if you're looking replacement battery or extra battery your kodak camera , this great one	1
got what i feel great price . these batteries , kodaks ones , haven't tried knock-offs , but they seem last forever . you go out into boonies 1 camera charged backup , i seems incomprehensible me you could run out resources . jbgtucso	1
this camera isn't intended semi pro , you probably aren't going win photography contests it , but someone who wants good point shoot camera take spur moment pictures , this camera works great . i took 30-40 pictures 5 min video when i took kids park today , camera didn't interfere our fun . i'm surprised how much video i am starting shoot it . controls extremely easy use . they even made exposure compensation easy . controls very well thought out which large part why it seems so simple/basic . it also comes good manual . finally , i find it fairly fast digital camera . we higher end digital everything , but controls so cumbersome it takes forever get it set up . also , i take camera bag or least carry it around my neck . this thing goes comfortably pocket . yeah , this camera isn't capable taking high quality pictures , but practice i am getting 5-10 times many good pictures enjoying myself process . picture quality good , i've noticed no distortion wide angle lens even distortion compensation turned off . regards some complaints .... 1 . easyshare setup annoying day or two , but if one keeps dock near your pc , it actually nice feature . i snap camera , press one button download , i am . still not happy , then get sd card reader off ebay . they dirt cheap . 2 . battery life included lithium ion battery good , because they use same battery multiple models , aftermarket batteries chargers available next nothing . this huge bonus this camera . 3 . yep , it probably lacking when it comes quality night photography , if you planning taking lot pictures night , then get camera . this pretty common complaint pocket cameras . 4 . semi-pros probably not satisfied lack alternative formats or ability tweak settings , but it point shoot after all	1
used this several times now love wide angle lens . stitching panorama shots good ( better practice pivoting rather than panning camera)quality acceptable point shoot but not sharp or clear my canon dslr . battery life good , start up time decently quick ( ~ 1.5 sec . ) transfer pc one touch easy . many ( almost too many ) picture modes . cons : flash weak , low light performance marginal best . overall , good pocket camera daytime parties , landscape impulse photography . superwide angle lens huge plus those situations warrant it ( real estate pics , group photos , vacation panoramas ) . rguard	1
we received skyquest xt 4.5 two weeks ago we absolutely love it . my six year old daughter i opened two boxes , put it together , within 15 minutes we out front our house looking moon , start clusters , moons cloud bands jupiter , andromeda galaxy . it big enough see all these things big city yet it small enough easily fit closet . if you looking light weight scope you pull out closet whim , big enough see items mentioned above , easy enough kid use , this one	1
after trying becoming frustrated department store telescopes , i spent lot time researching internet find scope both fit my needs beginner fit my budget . no matter how i looked it , this scope kept coming out top list . i've using it over month now not disappointed any way ! it ultra-portable , gives great views , took rank amateur ( me ) less than hour assemble align optics , thanks very good instruction manual . small size plus me . i keep it fully assembled sitting guest bedroom pick it up easily carry it out yard one piece . i just lay out blanket sit lawn observe - no need setup , fancy chairs , or tables . eyepiece perfect height my 4yr old daughter look through ( she already gotten few glimpses moon ) so it great tool us share . when she little bit bigger she easily able handle this scope herself . bigger scope give better/more powerful views , but if you tight budget , want something simple rugged , or want very portable scope , this your ticket ! after your first view jupiter ( its cloud bands moons ) you won't regret this purchase . --------- update 1 year later ! i just re-read this review i put up , can't reiterate it enough - this great little beginner scope ! last fall i bought one books i recommended this scope , " starwatch " phil harrington . just last week , i completed seasonal sky windows book - allowing me see all 110 messier dso all using this little 4.5 " scope ! if goofball like me figure out how use this scope use " starwatch " log all messier year - you too ! its great combo !!	1
bag pretty good , but it bit tight digital camera i bought . not flaw case , but not best ultra zoom type digital cameras	1
i bought this bag sony dcr trv19 mini dv camcorder . it enough room cables , power supply , external mic three tapes . not huge but sufficient if you want keep size minimum . i owned targus laptop computer bags found them high quality durability . so far this bag living up its legacy . i bought it sale 9.99 . i would still pay 12 bucks it	1
this fabulous gift grandparents if you preload pictures . just aware customer support folks not knowledgeable , probably since product new . don't bypass their software load pix if you're transferring your pc frame - their software reduces memory needed each one . even though software different size frames labelled same , it not compatible you only one version installed your pc time	1
i like way this charger keeps it simple . it small enough pack take it you it charges batteries fast . great keeping my backup battery charged ready	1
this printer works very well our system . it great print quality speed acceptable . only complaint i you use kodak paper comes cartridges	1
overall excellent video camera ( vc ) . this my second sony most liekly buy anohter sony when this one wears out or becomes obscelete . records digital digital 8 tape . i'd probably go ahead get dvd recorder or hdd recorder , except price thsi much more reasonable i kenw what expect sony dcr line vcs . would recommend anyone who looking basic vc record those events life ... children too ...	1
i really enjoyed using my camcorder . it so small lightweight picture quality very good . maybe lack experience , zoom function felt little awkward . picture tells thousand words , but camcorder , well it next best thing taking my mother who unable travel . she agreed when she saw tape .	1
i this lens two months i love it . it allows me get really close subjects . you even subject touching lens still focus . lens great quality . amazon least expensive site i found this product . great shipping tracking . i highly recommend this product all dsc-h1 or h2 or h5 owners	1
great close up lens , would love buy telephoto lens my sony dsc-h	1

we bought jvc bn-vf714u protect us " dead battery exactly wrong moment " syndrome . multiple occasions , we've used battery 2+ hours vf lcd use whole time . after 3 months use , i'd recommend battery anyone buying camcorder	1
first all , camera this goes slightly dissappointing . that beside point this review though . reason you probably looking this product because you might tired standard battery short lifespan . this product lives up three hour life when you use it viewfinder mode . only thing i don't like battery size . it extends further than standard one it almost embarrasing it . other than size battery great i would say must accessory this particular camera	1
external battery charger works great so far . i haven't noticed difference performance yet when comparing charges this product versus charging battery camera cradle . it takes less than hour charge completely . long awaited product since you don't want carry camera cradle everywhere	1
i recently purchased couple items amazon , casio np-40 battery casio bc-30l charger my ex-z750 digital camera . i am happy products impressed quick delivery packaging . you sure i ordering more items amazone confidence	1
i always slr photographer held off purchasing digital camera up until now because i not convinced resolution capabilities digital . i travel alot sometimes due space sometimes due desire inconspicuous i needed something smaller than my full size slrs . after lot research , looking every model i could find , i settled this panasonic lumix lx2 because i don't give up control over every aspect photo . this camera lets you control freak , or you leave it one several automatic modes . it store pictures raw mode , which important me ( canon g7 lost out because it didnt this ) but jpeg mode great . i blown up some prints this camera i am completely satisfied quality , i skeptical before , expecting underwhelmed . i originally bought this backup my slrs but i already see this my primary camera unless i am situation calls special lens , flash power , or super high resolution ( like 25 or 60 asa)my only suggestion panasonic would allow you charge battery while camera , like car charger , make some sort accomodation external flash . flash this camera weak spot - it really not bad size but if it could sync external flash would good	1
i've this camera month . i currently own nikon d50 2 year old canon powershot . i needed something small handy use walk around camera . i've reading reviews months various digital cameras , poured through thousands images posted flickr , i decided this camera . i loved look , size , price , leica lens . images sharper colors more vibrant than my nikon d50 my canon powershot . i love manual settings available this camera . i mostly use setting . although adjusting shutter speed aperture awkward using joystick , menu very simple offers lot control . i also like fact people stop me street whenever i use my camera	1
i love this tripod ! i am extremely happy my purchase . it built heavy duty ( like its name implies ) . all controls operate easily stay position you put them . it trust-worthy piece equipment definitely make my ' shooting sessions ' easier , higher quality photo . quick shipping well packaged . i'm happy all way around this purchase . bubble level feet which allow soft stand or spiked stand nice well actually used ( unlike similar ones not dependable ) . most definitely worth investment	1
tripod easy adjust , just right height , fits my large suitcase very attractive . i wish it came carrying case or least built-in handle . i leery its low price " " shaped legs but it well made very sturdy . legs easy set-up different lengths , case you working non-level surface . i'm concerned handle plastic pan-head tight when trying move up down	1
me encanta esta camara , antes de �sta estuve cambiando c�mara cada 2 o tres meses , ahora me quedo con esta , es muy atractiva , funciona excelente , los videos son buen�simos , talvez se compara con la calidad del hi8 . como la mayor�a de las c�mara compactas , las fotos nocturnas no son muy buenas , el flash no tiene mucho alcance , aunque es mucho mejor que el de la sony , en general , un producto totalmente recomendado	1
this my second kodak compact digital camera . previous one i owned v530 which very similar this camera . i hoping v603 would correct one problem plagued v530 -- consistently dark pictures full automatic mode . turns out this problem persists this camera too , probably result using common software within both these camera models . but least v603 " perfect touch " picture fixup capability which , when applied dark picture , generally fixes problem . but you fix each picture individually using perfect touch which somewhat hassle . other nice thing this camera comparison v530 ability charge battery in-camera . camera nice , sleek body good , solid feel . overall not too bad camera	1
this camera actually purchased my teenage daughter . this our 4th easyshare camera i would highly recommend it everyone . i purchased different easyshare march , although it wonderful , once i saw how small easy use this one - i wish i would waited got this same one instead . i find myself borrowing this one my daughter using it more than my own ( which also wonderful camera ) ..	1
lumix dmc-lz2 5mp digital camera easy use takes great pictures . only gripe i flash could stronger . i set iso 400 take indoor pictures without flash . resulting pictures usually superior ones taken flash . it worth money	1
well this not my first digital camera , i g5 , g6 a620 . i am used them focusing real well first time around most time . i expected r1 focus well first time i shot , it didn't though so i very dissapointed this . i found out some auto focus features need turned off order it focus better it help alot but focus slow . money i spent i expected better focus area . lens great photo quality very good . it just not quick . battery life very good . camera feels pretty good hands but i would liked see metal . i don't like plastic cameras . i want feel i own something when i hold it . i don't care how light it . i am happy my camera least fact quality shots good any digital slr . i am glad it good lens i don't like buy alot lens so sony good this aspect r1 . if i knew what i know now i might not bought r1 maybe i would went something else . if something else little better speed area focus . but when i think it there not many choices something good lens already not mirror reflex where one worry dust . this one better respect . this why i give camera 4 because sony could perfected this camera but they not .	1
i just my r1 week now i love it . summary , it awesome camera . takes great quality pictures true colors great details . i got it $650 price , i'd say it bargain . if you're market full size professional digital camera , r1 camera you've looking . addition awesome quality pictures it takes , 5x zoom , long battery life , cf memorystick options , swifel lcd screen , etc .. makes this camera even more competitive	1
i own 2 nikon en-el1 batteries taken total over 6,000 photos my nikon 4300 past 3 years . half photos flash . my typical use , i get 50 photos per battery . vacation photos , i am using one battery , while charging other . after 3,000 photos/battery 3 years , i not noticed any degradation battery life . good value money .	1
i nikon coolpix 4300 digital two these batterys . they work great long they last which not 2 hours my case . maybe it because i leave monitor flash most time take my pictures large size . all all two these battery i never run out juice	1
plastic o ring carrying case which holds large shoulder strap came broken . thus it renders case un-useable . time , my cost it would file complaint ship case back not worth it me . however if bushnell would send me new carrying case , i would very pleased transaction . howard . rutkowski	1
this great set . eyepieces high qualiity . case very durable well . i not played filters yet , but they screw easily into any eyepiece . $60.00 , you not go wrong . amazon great place save this item	1
i bought one these cameras because it cheap , kodak pretty good reputation . however , i found quality pictures it takes rather low , it consumes batteries very quickly . it doesn't zoom , so unless you're close something , it won't take very good picture . once picture scanned onto computer , or printed , it very grainy pixellated . you get other brands similar price much better quality	-1
case fits all camera gear isn't too bulky or large . we're very happy our purchase	1
i really enjoy this small , high quality camara . i purchased 2.0 gb memory disk so i could take advantage 7.1 mega pixel . i get great pix everytime . i lots fun it . since its so small , it easy take everywhere me . i also get lots compliments it " fashionable " sleek design . i highly recomend his camera .	1
i got this camera bag hoping all camera stuff ( charger , cables tapes ) fit it , photos net not clear enough , but i found product good material , suitable color , took every thing i need even my digital camera bag . i faced only one problem my canon elura 100 camcorder too small compared space inside bag , i put it upside down ( lense facing bottom ) , so i added soft pad bottom apply more protection bag default normal bottom layer not giving shock absorbtion if bag fall down hit ground	1
it provides essentials i looking store my camera extra battery . perfect size	1

i am extremely pleased this camera . i used it variety different photographic situations such : sport events , low light no light , indoor without flash , beach , indoor sun shinning windows , close ups zoom , it excelled every one ! i like it much better than my 35mm slr ( pentax me super )	1

i bought third party charger save money instead buying this one . third party charger died after 3 months no obvious reason . then i bought this one . it works perfectly , i expect it foreseeable future , i've never problem official canon merchandise . , it came power cords compatible just every type wall socket existence ( very convenient if you travel like i ) . don't waste your time money third party piece junk . buy this charger instead	1
i purchased this product reading other buyer reviews but when i used this product , i fully satisfied .	1
i've owned my rebel now almost year this charger i use both my batteries ! ( one time .. :-)) one person stated , once you learn how put battery it becomes second nature . ( it doesn't just slide it , but started near top . ) i no problem recommending this charger	1
get 1.8 aperture , super sharp , prime lens " " coveted nikon name it under $100 dollars still hard me comprehend . i continue awed i go out shooting dreamlike state ... wake me when its over ... my only lingering question ... " it last ? " ... hey nikon , how offering up some more this prime candy some us who consider great value important part purchasing equation . thanks . enjoy :)	1
if you buy this nikon d40 , please read title again . if you quick read other reviews , you may not get read some mention fact this lens not autofocus nikon d40 . if you don't care this , you'll find this little lens great . pictures crisp clear , full light . great addition your lens collection	1
i like this len light weight , sharp focus ability shoot low lights . it make noticeable sounds it brings focus , but not untolerable . if you single love photography , get it .... you know you want it . if you married , then convince your spouse $100 worth month latte , you stop drinking latte month get this lens ..... that what i i not regret it bit .	1
i lot hiking looking something lighter weight than slr would still allow me take telephoto macro shots . this camera smallest lightest one i found 8x or higher zoom . i taken very sharp telephoto photos wildlife macro shots flowers people thought taken high-end camera . this camera well conventional landscapes indoor flash snapshots . menu controls very easy use there enough presets special situations compensate lack manual controls . however , if you mostly take snapshots not require 8x zoom , i would look other models . while , this small long zoom camera , it still too big easily fit pocket or purse . primary flaws this camera : it only 4 megapixels . battery charger failed replaced 18 months after purchase ( this particularly problem since camera takes propietary battery rather than aas ) . delay taking pictures longer than many competitors . occasionally lens cap not open completely ( easily fixed if you notice it before snapping your picture ) .	1
i bought nikon coolpix 4800 digital camera two weeks ago . most important feature i looked forward 8.3 optical zoom . picture quality great menu easy use . camera body very handy user-friendly . battery charges quickly lasts long . user manual simple easy understand . excellent video quality added bonus ! one improvement i would like suggest nikon making lens cover more robust or providing additional cap . users , using tripod full zoom recommended . all all great camera	1
i extremely impressed this camera ; i felt only not exceptional feature its nonwithstanding aptitude steady shots . other than , i felt it fantastic , exceeded all expectations	1
charger works great , i use it my flash which holds 2 4 batteries , so i always 2 standby . quick charge works great well	1
i first used this combo binoculars/digital camera recent vacation kenya . quality exceeded my expectations . i expecially liked we could also take mini videos ( up 30 secs ) animals well stills . negative : battery compartment not well designed inserting batteries sometimes frustrating . overall , i am really glad i purchased this product . it alot fun use	1
i really excited receive bushnell instant replay birthday present . however , i quickly learned it incredibly difficult binocular operate . first all , i trouble opening battery compartment cover . i pry it out knife after many unsuccessful attempts . then i hard time installing flash memory card . instruction booklet terrible not mention right way instal it . i installed it wrong way it got jammed so i pry it out pair pliers !! after doing all , i got camera work . then i decided i instal software - driver photosuite . driver installed easily . not so photosuite . after three attempts , icon not appear nor it appear programs . i'm returning camera	-1
i bought this camera looking better 1 than i ... it works great , priced good .. m/pixels , features , little complicated someone never used 1 , plz read manual ...	1
i am very pleased this camera , though i am still trying learn all features . this my third digital camera hopefully my last . it takes fantastic pictures .	1
this my third kodak camera . i love zoom image stabilization this one . kodak cameras so easy use ! only thing i am little dissapointed shutter response time when camera highest quality setting using flash . it still hard get those instant action shots . however , it better than cameras i past picture quality fabulous	1
i bought this camera replace fuji i bought 3 years ago ( which amazing workhorse camera until i dropped it one too many times ... ) . after much research , i chose this one because i happy fuji , already great xd card , this looked like it would fill order . it ever ! first assignment ? family trip disney . after one read-through manual , i felt comfortable using it action , low-light , no flash , fireworks pictures , they all turned out beautifully . downloading pics quick easy . display huge . battery life concern me , i really happy , although i purchasing extra battery my personal satisfaction . variety light , zoom , flash conditions , my camera took approx 120 pics 2 megapixels before battery became concern . i took many more days where outdoor photos not require my flash . i love able some basic editing right camera , such picture rotation digital zoom . busy mom , it saves time . i'm looking forward discovering even more summer requires more pictures , but consider this average picture-taking mom completely satisfied	1
amazon mistakenly sent underwater housing instead camera . mean time i ordered different camera ( canon sd700 ) . i returned this camera using downloaded ups return labels refunded entire amount i paid since this amazon mistake . kudos amazon !	1
i've canon digital cameras past two years my first , opted purchase accompanying canon camera case . though it good fit , it couple flaws caused me look elsewhere case when i got my second digital camera this year . this time around , i chose tamrac case because , unlike canon , it zips closed . canon flap closure creates two big gaps either side case , allowing small particles get inside camera itself . second , tamrac features not only belt loop , like canon , but nice shoulder strap . this means user carry camera hands free without put it purse or backpack . this case fits many small film slim digital cameras ( go tamrac website download spec sheet lists camera/case compatability ) , so don't expect custom fit . my canon a510 , this case bit long side , but no so much so i concerned it shifting around too much case . it good bag great manufacturer decent price . recommended	1
after much research i finally found binoculars fit my every need . price right , delivery right schedule , product excellent	1
first hotshoe bubble level i purchased survived whole year half before it fell off my camera somewhere northern iceland ( i spend several hours back tracking but i unable find this bright green $30 piece plastic snow ) . far tools go , this one most frequently used item my camera bag . i use it vast majority my shots ensure i level horizon ( which makes stitching panoramic shots much easier ) . only drawbacks plastic may eventually wear away enough it no longer fits hotshoe leaving it rather prone slipping out without much force price : it $30 piece plastic air bubble ! all fairness , it hold up abrasion rather well	1
i looking basic pair binoculars our everyday use . i some really expensive leupold binoclulars my favorite , but all around family use , especially kids , this great option . they waterproof , rubber coated protection , powerful ( 10x ) , focus easily adjustable . money ? it great buy	1
i just got kit today . i think it great deal price . my camera fits into bag perfectly . i kodak cx7300 . if your camera larger than , i don't think it going fit bag . that just my opinion . :	1
mobicam ultra lived up every expectation i video monitoring systems . i wouldn't baby without mobicam ultra . audio reception crystal clear . night video little hard see but it clear enough tell if your child moving around or his eyes open . regular video also crystal clear . only issue i video starts bad reception within house if you get more than 50 feet camera but sound works when i walk outside backyard or get mail . ( 200 feet ) i would suggest this model anyone interested good quality baby video monitoring system	1
this one better grades film i started using . it great saturation sharpness colors , exceptional film	1
i bought this camera october 2004- when product first released . i zero problems it , nothing but best things say it photo capabilities . i think this best balance quality price . besides , you don't need more than 7.1 mp any photography . if i shot photos full 7.1 mp i could make life size posters ! true test this camera ( me ) when i went vacation up california coast . i shot most amazing pictures big sur . detail exquisite , color amazing . since i purchased this camera , my photoshop days over . i never adjust color any shot i take , why i love this camera so much . if you looking camera capabilities slr without size slr , this definitely one get .	1
price low , then quality high . my doughter take photo almost everyday . little bit bigger size camera but photo quality much nicer than other compact camera .	1
i've only camera few weeks now , but i already love it . it fits my hand perfectly , lens excellent , startup time great too . i've particular fun super macro mode , although i'm going get additional uv filter cover lens because i don't want scratch lens getting too close something . it great possibility past ' auto ' settings , isn't heavy some dslrs would . i find evf ( electronic view finder ) just right brightness ( some said they thought it too dark ) , although evf resolution bit grainy , i know photos themselves coming out fantastic , so it not problem . it my first non ps camera - i got this instead dslrs i looking am very happy my decision . great bang buck	1
this adapter works well natural light settings but doesn't work when using built flash camera . there design flaw causes underexposed pics when using flash . it great add using filters protecting lens otherwise	1
what steal this camera ! just got it mail this week , it proven itself well worth buying . i love pretty much everything it . pictures , even auto mode , crisp detailed . if you like photography side , aperture , shutter , focus settings very comprehensive . i never " real " camera before other than cheap 35mm one , haven't taken any photography classes or learned anything photography . i only read little bit online basics , within 2 days i adjusting settings scene needs wow pictures turned out great . if you interested photography , this definitely camera you . one thing mention , however , sd cards really fast while camera , but once you connect camera pc via usb , pictures take while load order edit ( photoshop ) . i highly recommend fast sd card , like sandisk sd extreme iii . battery life pretty good , even when doing video . videos look sound great , you take pictures while you record video . i looking this camera 2 months finally bought it , it well worth it . if you're fence this or more expensive canon or nikon , i'd go this unless you're super hardcore . 5/5 stars excellent product incredible price .	1
price paid , this great camera . should last me long time . debated buying slr , but this seems all features expensive slr ( actually it slr , just no interchangable lenses ) lot easier use	1
i this printer six months am very pleased results . printer comes " starter pack " print 5 7 pictures so you want get additional paper pack . output excellent - amateur , i cannot discern difference these photos those photo lab . they even " kodak " printed back paper ! i printed 50 pictures so far no snags . this best photo printer i owned ( much more reliable than picturemate epson its " cloggy " print head you touch photo right away without smudging unlike full-size hp photo printer psc-2210 ) . largest picture pack give you prints $0.20 each - not too bad get instant results	1
i am not new digital cameras . this camera , overall , more usable than any digital camera i or . i've owned used camera 7 months may 06 . i owned olympus , sony fuji digital cameras . this camera far , easiest menus navigate easy navigate quickly without reading instructions . back display huge bright , glass reinforced , which lot competitors not . this keeps away scratches smashes . casing real metal , so you not baby it , finally , size shape this camera make it very convenient carry front pocket jeans no problems . this razr digital cameras , my opinion . it ready take pictures very quickly when you open lens cover . rechargable battery never died me before i ran out 1 gb memory card . flash adequate but bit slow recharge . this not problem me however , because i chose this camera two unique features , first -- " natural light mode " -- " flash off " mode enhances pictures natural light . i take most my pictures , even indoors , no flash , because i like look natural light . this camera great capturing under those conditions . second feature i like camera called " photochrome " mode -- it richens colors makes pictures sort " technicolor " look . print worthy many cases . i use this conjunction natural light mode . only drawbacks i could think this camera because screen size/vs megapixel , sometimes you think photo come out clearly looking screen , but if you didn't use flash moved ( which obviously makes pictures blurry ) it show up blurry full size when you download it pc . only reason i rated 4 stars instead 5 because super low light situations fact picture 5 megapixels but you view it lcd tricks you thinking picture captured clearly when you might slight blur full size . this may true all cameras , i don't know . this auto focus camera . you get incredibly clear pictures close ups regular photos , but you let it focus . this not " wail your arms around while dance floor snap pictures " camera . many people detract camera because they want it fixed focus camera situations like described above . tempting because it so portable stylish , but this camera fills needs much more than fixed focus . i 4 megapixel fuji s3100 situations where i need mega zoom , but , who wants lug around camera bag trip mall or walmart or work ? i also own sony dsc-p72 which not bad anything , but isn't great anything either , too big hogs batteries . previously i owned olympus digital cameras . i've found 5 megapixels z1 more than adequate , i often shoot 2 or 3 . i black edition . it show finger prints . if i it again i'd choose silver only reason . i carry this camera often because its so convenient , often those pictures i'd missed only owning larger camera not lugging it captured because how convenient it carry this camera . its no burden all travel , produces great results , battery lasts long , durable .	1
i looking this traditional look photo frame quite long time . i search no more . i found it . i love this unit it very user friendly . pros -- nice frame design clear widescreen . fast slideshow . pictures don't distort like others . internal memory store up 20 hi-res photos . on-screen menu shown buttons . best all : last memory ! cons -- buttons top just few . no cf .	1
frame good deal 10 inch lcd , least when i bought it month ago . pictures look great , slide show i converted mpeg played no problems	1
if you like idea relatively inexpensive , lightweight , compact zoom binoculars , then look no further . i just got my pair nikon travelite zoom ( 8-24 25 cf ) nocs , i already love them . don't let bird watching crowd talk you out getting pair zoom binoculars , folks . when binocular nuts say zoom nocs " don't perform well , " try discourage others buying them , what they really mean most people don't know what expect when they get their hands pair zooms , sometimes unpleasantly surprised find out they don't work exactly like their favorite fixed magnification nocs . all optical tools , zoom nocs best certain kinds uses , not so good others . specifically , bottom end their range , they " see " same any fixed mag nocs same focal dimensions optic quality . however , you increase zoom , three things happen : 1 ) your field view gets smaller ; 2 ) visible light coming through nocs lessens , or , image gets little bit " darker , " 3 ) it becomes more difficult keep nocs fixed your target . now obviously , if you attempting watch something like small bird flight , perhaps even adjust zoom while trying keep nocs focused your subject same time , you very frustrated " performance " these or any zoom binoculars . isn't because nocs aren't doing their job ... it because you're using wrong kind optical tool task hand ! if , other hand , you looking well-lighted subject stationary , or not moving around too much , you just want get little closer look it , you absolutely thrilled what you get these nocs . nikon optics crystal clear first rate modest price . zoom mechanism simple , smooth cool . " zoom " you simply turn zoom ring located right eyepiece clockwise , then back other way " zoom out . " diopter ( that adjuster compensates focal differences right left eyes individual users ) located left eyepiece . nocs solidly constructed , nice " tight " feel all moving parts , black rubber armor covering most exterior , good grip . they're very lightweight , fit your hands like glove , come neck strap , eyepiece caps , custom-fitted , black nylon mesh carrying case belt loop back . finally , if you any difficulty holding nocs steady their maximum magification ( most people ) , fear not ! think getting adjustable monopod rest nocs while you look through them , e.g. , polecat " explorer " stoney point , their optional binocular rest . this monopod adjusted hold your nocs steady you , whether you're standing or sitting . it doubles walking stick , standard screw mount top use cameras , camcorders , etc . i've now gotten used this little " extra " myself , it vastly enhanced my enjoyment nocs , especially higher magnifications . i personally think negative press zoom nocs nonsense . just satisfy yourself zoom nocs ok your intended use(s ) , then learn how use them right way . i took chance bought nikon travelite zoom nocs , sight unseen , i'm glad i . these great compact binoculars price	1

i initially bought digital frame target take it back because picture quality so bad ( not mention bad remote lack functions ) . i got pandigital office depot i am so glad i . pictures bit contrasty but i worked out . video function plus - i thought i wouldn't use- but it worked very well my camera/frame combo . small videos i took my camera never used until now . i love this function ! it also easy load ( copy paste ) my sd card worked straight my camera ( panasonic waterproof digital . i wish you could mix playing video pictures , but then again , you don't want talking customer work all sudden hear video your picture frame . i'll use remote . rotate feature also feature i like which other frame not	1
good product - but price double price generic batteries . they no longer made japan . now they made china . price i would rather made japan . not noticed difference when compared generics . i guess time tell if generics stop holding their charge continued usage . using made japan version 2yrs still holding their charge .	1
daughter great time using it . size makes it easy take it anywhere	1

i lookin big frame without big price , this perfect !! very easy use i bought 256m sd card filled it 130photos just put card , after adjusting brightness i all set , its very simple use , price well worth it !!	1
this not high-tech digital frame . it doesn't play mp3 . it doesn't come remote . it simply reads your digital pictures card displays them slide show mode . there " " button " off " button . there no manual read order learn how operate your frame ( though it come one-page instruction sheet ) . it great your office desk when all you need reach over turn it or off . if you want display it difficul t-t o-reach location , or choreograph your pictures music , then this not frame you	1
very good picture quality . very small easy carry around . mp3 quality good even speakers decent job considering size device . few minor complaints . flash auto mode flashes twice so your unaware subject move after first one ruin photograph . there no problem other modes . beware if you mac . i haven't able figure out how put video thing which not what i really bought it so who cares . mp3 function works fine mac uploading pictures no problem through iphoto . conclusion : great little camera perfect going out decent mp3 ( great value money way ) . video format needs reworked mac but should work well windows	1
i absolutely love this camera ! granted it first digital camera i myself ever owned but i plenty friends cameras . nv3 far best i've ever used . it some extras like mp3 mpeg4 playback may seem unnecessary first but you won't able let it go once you set everything up your liking drop atleast 2gb sd card insane amount storage . battery life great , flash great , picture quality just below slr quality ! i love it , samsung outdone themselves this one	1
i'm very much pleased paperit cheaper than i thought it would . i very urgent paper came right time . ^	1
this great camcorder . it very small , compact , easy run , even looks nice . it actually fits most average size digital camera cases . i've not it all long , but so far i am pleased it . let me just list pros cons ; hopefully it helpful . pros : * 30g hard disk drive massive . * recharges less than 2 hours . * used while pluged ac adapter/charger . * relatively easy use -- self explanatory manual on-screen display . * digital pics better than i expected . * plugs right into tv/vcr/dvd playback/burning/recording . * indoor average light situation acceptable me ; everything shows up fine ( though lower than average light , video gets bit grainy ) . * remote great -- you put camera stand use remote record zoom ( use playback/tv mode ) . cons : * battery only good 60 minutes . * software not very good ; it bogs down my computer not easy use . * light camera only good close up ( though this expected ) . * record button split-second slow when shutting recording off . * view screen cannot bend backwards more than 90 degrees ; it only twists up down . summary , i am happy camera think it worth money . i may some point purchase or find better software edit these movies . they , way , play newest windows media player ( version 11 ? ) . i also plan getting battery back-up .	1
jvc g-series camcorders excellent value . gzmg57 no exception . i bought this my wife she thrilled . she likes point-and-click simplicity , millions features , simple video browsing ( playback ) mode , quality video . some professional reviewers rate jvc lens technology lower than sony , because theory sony lens superior . practice , there no difference . sony touch-screen menus big hassle , too . us , this model perfect mix features cost . it takes wonderful indoor pictures ( well outdoor ) thanks 1.2 lens , built-in light ( unlike gzmg7x models ) , shoots wide-screen ( 16:9 ) , stores 7 hours highest quality video , sdram card ( easy controls transfer / hard drive ) , 15x zoom . it also works our mac pc ( mac , i recommend you just use built-in idvd software instead jvc software ) . sony sc100 much larger hard drive , but that it . that not enough justify $250 price differential , imho .	1
i purchased this cancorder one purpose : playback old 8mm tapes recording onto dvd-r recorder . this purpose it ideal : low cost ; colour view sceen sound ; plays 8mm hi8 tapes ; rugged high quality feel , so it may last long time ; apparently only name-brand 8mm camera available this time . if you looking general purpsose camcorder not buy this one following reasons1 . 8mm hi8 obsolete . when your camcorder finally breaks ( all three mine after average 5 years use ) you hard time finding device playback your precious tapes . 2 . this camcorder no " steady shot " which my experience most important feature easy recording good quality videos . 3 . this camcorder rather big heavy compared many others available . steven woodward	1
i love adapter saving me buy mega expensive cr2 batteries my eos t2 uses . however i thought i could use rechargeable batteries this adapter . most nimh nicad rechargeables 1.2 ( versus alkaline 1.5 ) i am guessing 4 rechargeables only giving 4.8 versus 2 cr2 giving 6 volts ... not enough power camera .	1
purchased camera_world $49 . these authentic canon batteries original packaging . they work great i put them through many cycles . they hold up terrificly	1
these glasses small , protable good concerts quick bird work . i keep set car , but they not replace my larger busnells birding . please don't expect more than little backyard birding these , i am now adjusted my larger set , so i use those yard . you get what you pay	1
what not like ? light , compact comes strap , case wipe cloth . they perfect . keep mind 12 power more challeging hold still	1
these great little binoculars i use quite often . they so compact lightweight i grab them whenever i leave house - whether it boat ride around lake or just quick ride . i don't see quite well when i leave my eyeglasses it take little bit more adjusting get focus right eyeglasses , but they great pair binoculars price . i am very impressed quality them .	1
if you looking camera everything you need transfer movies your computer this not it . it work if you get cable you use software suite such nero ( often comes w/ dvd burners)- but these things don't come camera . size camera great well battery life . biggest problem , important one , we found this camera dark picture- picture bit grainy pixely especially poor performance low lighting . battery life size not good enough sacrifice sharp picture quality bright picture colors .	1
this camera great ! really user friendly takes great quality videos . lcd screen touch screen which makes it simple play back videos work camera . anyone looking small camera thats easy work ... this one !!	1
we purchased this camera video my newborn son , we very pleased . all features it , there no way go wrong . it easily mastered you not need college education order operate it	1
my wife i bought this our optura 2000mc go our honeymoon found this very useful day long excursions . we hardly needed look power bar whole time . also size helpful because it helped balance camera steadier shot . definitley worth getting	1
i bought this camera divers outlet florida city , florida . they 2 them clearance table $39.99 each . i went off dive boat key largo when i dive shop john pennicamp state beach down road i noticed they same camera rental price $25.00 day . i haven't developed film yet , but flash ready after few seconds shots you can't beat price stick . case didn't leak all , although i only dove " christ statue " which only like 25ft down . excellent alternative digital camera if your'e poor white trash like me	1
this why sony hot ! this sexy little ( yes its really small size pack cards ) it takes perfect clear crisp pictures battery life long 320mins perfect vacation , make sure get memory stick it though , because w/o it it only holds 15 pics . this my first digital camera i would definitely buy sony again	1
sony w55 followup successful popular w50 . it very good compact camera , easy carry easy use , reasonably priced - so most people happy it . not much changed w50 , which this case good thing ! one change w55 7 mp camera , rather than w50 6mp . honestly , that not big plus , they haven't made sensor catches light any larger . same ( good ) lenses , same size sensor = same ( good ) pictures , but not better . ( though it might help little features like smart zoom . ) obvious change course colors . don't make too much fun ! there 4 dsc-w series cameras our family , colors would kept my mother-in-law taking my sister camera home her . little personalization good thing . internal memory expanded ( 56mb ) , but i've never used internal memory cameras it , so i'm not sure matters much . it might worth knowing how use backup , dozen or two shots if your card full , or you some other problem . controls , menus interface w55 reasonably easy use . example , w55 easy access various scene modes ( twilight , etc ) , some explanation screen what those mysterious little icons mean ( so you might actually use them , since it tells you what they ! ) . if you're new digital photography , there learning curve . but if you've used other cameras much , especially sonys , you pick this up use many features right away . read short introductory guide comes camera , though ! rechargeable battery should easily last you full day shooting - hundreds shots - no problem . ( little wise turning it off when you're not using it ! ) so you probably don't need second battery , unless you're going into woods while . it nice not mess bulky aa rechargeables . also , lithium ion batteries don't memory effect , so don't worry partial recharging . just charge battery each night . so - before getting second battery , try it while see if you need it . but get case - something protect screen , least . fully closed one might help resist rain splashes little , too . you'll also want get memory stick pro duo card - pro cards faster , you need smaller duo size this camera . get 1-2gb card so you don't think running out memory too much - if you shop carefully , you find them so little these days it well worth avoiding running out memory . you might want spare card if you plan travel more than week , or use video mode often - which surprisingly good ( though bit dark ) if set fine , but uses enormous amounts storage setting . you stretch your memory , your hard drive space , using one lower-resolution settings take snapshots . you don't really need 7mp all your photos ! w55 take better photos than those credit-card type cameras tiny lens system - optics always make difference camera . any reasonable person very happy pictures w55 , given size it . camera little slow often take disappointing pictures low light dark situations . try high iso mode low light no-flash situations - picture quality suffers some , but most people find it useful . realistically , no ultra-compact camera work really well situation - if you need often , think something bigger lens bigger sensor . good light always gives best pictures any camera . there limits what you currently expect any ultracompact camera . w55 offers enough controls ( through scene modes program mode ) allow fair amount control over pictures , automatic camera . charger fairly compact rated 100-240v , so while you'll need plug adapter overseas you won't need voltage converter . battery charger little slow , though probably ok . keep this camera charged handy , you'll find you take lot pictures because it easy carry easy use	1
i lot olympus manual focus lenses my old om-4t . i like use these , but e-volt 500 poor viewfinder manual focusing . as-me-1 just enough help . it not perfect - constricts field view more than i would like - but it makes manual focusing doable reasonable me . this doesn't magnify smallish viewfinder very much but it makes manual focus reasonable option . oh yeah , it much more comfortable against my eye than default eyecup .	1
ok - read all 7 reviews ( thank you other 7 opening my eyes ) i decided plunk down dough buy one . i wasn't able understand why people so diametrically opposed this simple accessory - it always either god gift cameras or useless day long . it arrived today ups ( thanks amazon prime - next day service!)here what i tell . i've olympus user since 2500 days - after 2500 i graduated e20n - similar viewfinder - nice big image , easy use . i avoided e-1 , content my e20n wondering what 4/3 system would bring revolutionize cameras or become standard . now i've moved evolt 300 - day one , my biggest complaint " viewfinder too small " - still my e20n i compared them - sure enough 300 smaller than e20n . what going here ? i bought my as-me-1 it clicked easier than rubber cup . bam suddenly my view big again - like e20n ! i see again . i seeeee again ! ( little miami vice music here ) if you tweek focus , it big deal . my personal theory ( i am wrong well right ) it depends if you use prescription glasses . or maybe other prescriptions . eye entrance pupil . as-me-1 guides light focus grid through pupil . i personally like shoot my glasses . camera up , halfway push , fully push if happy , camera down . my friends remove their glasses , their mouth they go , up eye goes rubber cup - they shoot shoot shoot . they don't seem bothered e300 . if you nearsighted your glasses make things look smaller than they actually ( ask old ben franklin who invented eyeglasses ) - as-me-1 counters this effect prescription lenses . if you remove your glasses or 20/20 vision , well , you may like bigger image , but it not likely big deal it me . i'm happy - 5 stars all - it winner . i fully respect people who given it one star . they made me search reason . i think eyeball vision glasses key this product benefit or hindrance shooter . yes , its 20% larger ( 1/5 ) - me that big deal . given price potential performance ratio , it winner good chunk population who doesn't remove their eyeglasses snap picture those 20/20 shoot nightime or dimly lit studio large entrance pupil likely not benefit . human sensory perception threshold noticability 10% meaning if one cup water 10% hotter than it felt hotter , but less than 10% it likely feel same temperature , same goes shades grey , almost any perception . it called 10% rule . 20% increase picture size , as-me-1 pretty much guaranteed noticed human physiology , final reason i bought it . lets hope your experiences good ones - i didn't say you'd like it - just notice it ! ( optics however top notch )	1
this great digital camera . i no problems it . i got it my 1st anniversary 2 yrs ago . its great ! you take pictures , put xmas , valentines or birthday borders around them b4 you take picture . it video too , you play back video , but there no sound because there no speaker camera , there mic thuigh . so when you download video , it play sound too . camera survivied dropped many times . i would like take long videos , so i am going purchase 4gb sd card . i feel sorry all people i saw complaining camera because i no problems 2 years now . only thing batteries die quickly ( using flash really drains battery ) , so i went bought high quality rechargable batteries , or disposable duracell meant digital cameras . also people who complained blurry pictures , it depends what setting you camera . i not like all those different setings , they just mess up pic . not use auto feature i always use non auto , egulr pic , flash . all those other settings confusing . oh yes great self timer when you noone hold camera	1
great size shape taking places . feels good your hand . boots up pretty quick . like color . impressed features . takes decent pictures . internal memory , well taking memory card . i suggest getting set good rechargable batteries .	1
i absolutely love this dvd camcorder . it so super small user friendly i can't explain . it very simple use . my only complaint frustration my sony vgc-ra710g vaio pc usb software sony dcr-dvd7 don't get . i thought sure sony would compatible sony , especially since both less than one year old . best i tell windows xp professional won't recognize usb connection camcorder because software isn't digitally signed or something . plus everytime i try just any installation variation my pc gets hung up ... something it never ever ever . so until sony answer why sony won't talk sony i can't give product 5 stars . this camcorder hook up easily tv , once you finalize your recordings , they play anything . i can't comment editing software because i only trying hook up camcorder pc via usb cable . my hopes assumptions i use software my finalized dvd . p.s. if any other users experiencing this same problem or offer any advice , it would greatly appreciated	1
works very well little instruction . camera grainy low light , crisp daylight . video crisp , audio good . easy touch screen application makes this camcorder delight use	1
i purchased this together 4 section monopod . this head very solid , works very smooth . i would definitely recommend this if you planning use it slr . i you smaller point shoot , you might want stay away . before my current rebel xti , i used this powershot s3 , quick release lever would stick into palm my hand . very uncomfortable distracting when you're trying compose	1
very well made looks like it hold up very long time ! i'm not professional photographer , far it , but i don't think you go wrong this if you dslr without huge telephoto lens support . i olympus e-500 system it great this	1
i've used this two different monopods , light-weight manfrotto monopod i use when i'm travelling , heavy-duty pro-grade manfrotto i use home . this head works wonderfully exactly what you'd expect company reputation bogen	1
i purchased this lens my fuji s5100 order take wide angle pictures rooms our house . this lens works well areas plenty light but if you need use camera flash then you may issues this unit . you may require additional flash slave unit or 2 properly light your subject which takes you whole new level photography . it seems built flash flips up too low blocked this lens . other then this , this lens puts out quality pictures attaches easily lens adaptor came s5100	1
five stars , even though image quality siffers tiny bit . $30 , what one expect ? easy installation use ( just screw it into filter theads lens , then shoot ) . built-in macro adapter further simplifies shooting . all all , good purchase decision	1
i some gift cards so i went buy my first digital camera . i went local electronics store i certain financial cap . i wasn't thrilled my choices but this camera caught my eye i just fell love it . i spend more than i planned but it 100% worth it . camera very easy hold , its not too small , its not too big . it fits easily into my purse . pictures beautiful , battery life great i yet exceed amount pictures i store . i over 300 now extended battery . only gripe i reset time every time i put battery back . its minor inconvenience . screen back larger than lot them out now . major deciding factor .. good zoom . it very nice silver color too . my first digital camera , this perfect choice .	1
i've extensive studying find good camera within my price range , this one it . months later , i no regrets whatsoever . i seen slightly newer moder , z760 , i honestly think this one better deal . z760 one more megapixel , but doesn't matter me . i zoom far photoshop go see differance , there really isn't much one . this odel superior zoom , which why i picked i t.t his one also automatic lens-cover , whereas z760 many other high zoom cameras lens covers you put yourself , which also easier get lost . this one doesn't all mickey-mouse options like fancy frames , but it alternations fit my needs . it b+w , sepia tone , well options low , natural , or high color , other options like light balance . i found out i don't like presets , but that just like me . i prefer use manual settings , which much easier access than most other cameras i've used . if i think couple bad sides , i'd say it image size need take battery out charge it . this camera only 8x10 shots , which isn't very useful if you intend more professional work . battery recharged taking it out putting charger , however this problem solved simply getting dock it . also , like most other cameras , this one isn't very smooth my computer . software little bit confusing , but this no problem either long you sd card reader	1
these batteries great batteries following characteristics : 2 123-size lithium batteries use photographic devices , also works certain calculators , pagers , watches , more . these batteries storage life up ten years . reliable high low temperature	1
we bought this charger long after we our camcorder . it wasn't until we purchased extra battery camera works off same battery we realized charging batteries off-camera better practise since camera/camcorder sometimes get unusually warm after charging . besides battery charge home/hotel while road stand-by secure feeling . device itself very compact sturdy color coded leds let you know when charging completed . it fits easily ( including little power supply box ) into camera/camcorder bag guaranteed travel companion .	1
excellent so far ; however , it not include usb cable computer . my only complaint so far ........	1
so far so good . used iit only few times . like feature still shots .	1
extremely impressed tz3 . this gem should get 5 stars construction finish alone . just holding it your hands it screams quality feels like tank . love it . it seriously feels like $700 camera . no exaggeration . i little worried it not able fit my jean pockets before buying it . women may issues really tight jeans but us guys no problem . it fits fine . i seriously cant believe i carry around camera 10x zoom inside my jean pockets . truly remarkable . 3 " screen amazing . you practically enjoy your pics right screen w/o even printing them high res output . navigation so easy this camera . something not surprising though if your already coming panny ( fz7 here ) . picture quality great . i tested it out today standard i would say its just good my fz7 daylight better lowlight ( indoors ) . image quality great , if you need extra sharpness you could always use camera " vivid mode " or add little some post processing . pics standard natural mode pp very well . wide angle something new me . took some neat shots looked very nice extra viewing angle . very distinctive after this i'm not sure if i could go back . if your looking it all camera this may very well your tool choice . combine it extreme versatility coupled excellent image quality , superb lens , build , finish you yourself winner .	1
i owned first generation dmc-tz1 . dmc-tz3 some welcome improvements ; wider angle , automatic lens cover , maybe 25% faster sho t-t o-shot . particular , wider angle really useful feature . camera strength its versatile , outdoor shooting . it best lots light . indoors , flash coverage just ok . sho t-t o-shot flash recycle time sometimes pokey 4 seconds . digital picture noise noticeable lesser light . setup tips : 1 . use 3x2 ratio if you primarily print 6x4 photos . 2 . use vivid mode normal mode looks washed out .	1
i bought my mother 7 " digital picture frame pandigital christmas . after using it couple days , my brother i both agreed it wasn't good product my mother . remote control didn't work well interface usb port wasn't working . so we returned product linens things it orginally purchased . month went my mother missed frame . she like able easily pop out memory chip her digital camera plug it into digital picture frame . so i went line found matsunichi photo frame . i never heard this brand before somewhat concerned quality it products . however reviews other people rated this pretty good price . i also upsized 8 " due all reviews i read it better aspect ratio digital pictures coming directly off camera memory ( i.e. , without resize ) . ease use simple use key my mother who not technical wiz ( not take time read manual ) . this frame very good value - price reasonable , picture quality very good easy use . frame good construction not cheap looking . i also read reviews other frames , but found several them very expensive ranging $150 some over $300 . i paid $139 this frame . don't understand why someone would pay $300 this size frame . i would buy this company again . my mom thrilled her new frame	1
pros : + cherry ( or mahogany ) frame + fine resolution - great color + good sound considering small speakers back mounted + several slideshow transition timing options + photos , music videos well + remote very basic ( simple)cons : - user interface tricky use screen menus first - remote could benefit pause buttoni got this unit myself but idea i'll get one my parents if it works out . my concerns ease use image quality , large picture size price . this unit attractive , displays nicely easy operate . all my parents need plug memory cards i send them turn it . all this under 200 bucks . they sure pack alot features into small package .	1
disagree previous poster - vialta vistaframe superb . i haven't seen any pixelation my pix . i keep frame my desk work it much admired . i love it pieces . my only complaint its price , when they eventually come down price i'll get one home use . also power-saving shutoff only kicks after 2 hours which i think too long . reasons i bought this one over others : * card compatibility * it stand-alone , no need upload/download pix via computer * size its screen * classic metal frame itself - doesn't detract pix , indeed when it you don't see frame . agree randomizer screenshow would good , also would nice able specify how long pics screen . only thing stopping me buying myself or gifts family price . love it	1
after working 35mm cameras such most " series " nikons , other formats , i searching digital camera would give me same results maybe surpass because digital capabilities . well , after spending quite bit money purchasing some digitals , i never felt " wow effect " until i came across this beauty . first , i most smart consumers researched well read reviews . reviews specs good enough purchase this model above all others including other panasonics . this camera takes amazing shots , still allows you manually change settings if you choose so . plus this inserting high capacity memory card , you shoot video scene length mem card . course this not take place quality camcorder , nor you adjust any settings once you video mode such zoom , but feature alone plus quality awesome . this past summer we took this camera vacation us shot beautiful sunsets great video our son surfing . i dozens cd incredible video footage even birth our first grandson . i recommend this camera 100% , it still less than $300 . if you shop around . if you want quality digital 35mm feel then go it ! one more very important thing , accessories very expensive if you buy them panasonic . this beauty hot shoe extra flash now here kicker , i decided see if my vivitar 283 flash would work camera yes it . matter fact all my flashes work , but course they should used extreme cases because built flash great . matter fact , i've only use it once night shot results awesome this camera .	1
i bought ( returned ) 2 other cameras before this one . they kodak z612 canon powershot s2 . this one far best . image stabilization incredible , colors natural . i am very pleased it	1
its sleek easy use . it takes great pictures alot feature	1
noticeable difference when used , i live smoggy vegas ! so i tell , can't beat price , i give it two thumbs up	1
my wife purchased one these frames her desk work year ago . she liked it so much we bought one our daughter who just new baby .	1
i bought this picture frame my dad christmas . i thought it would great gift because he somewhat home bound he alot pictures . i used sd card slot put pictures they display really great . he some black white pictures some pictues color they both look clear sharp bright . he pretty excited see what frame could wants even more his pictures scanned put display . it always gratifying your gift appreciated ... this one certainly	1
i purchased dsc-s90 4.1 camera myself christmas best buy because i $70 certificates them . carl zeis lens great it takes beautiful pictures up 8x10 11x14 good . it so many features battery life great . it came charger two sony batteries , but i use regular duracell alkaline batteries fill up memory stick ( 256k ) without changing them . big improvement over old one i . i used it hawaii found video good well it also records voice . person who problem batteries memory stick same compartment , just turn camera upside down remove memory stick your batteries won't fall out . i would recommend camera plan buy my son . buy your memory sticks amazon.com price good . i paid $30 + my 256 memory pro rate i take pictures equivilent four 4packs 400asa film . not so bad when you think it way .	1
i just got this camera christmas . i hate reading directions , so i popped battery memory card i off ! very user friendly , all right options . plus , its size average cell phone . coolest thing powershot it knows which way you're holding camera , so if you hold it vertical get tall shot , viewer turns all itself . i also love you edit video camera set up slide shows . its very easy load pics onto my computer usb connection - or set up slide show tv . it even holds voice memos cute sound effects when i take pictures . this really great camera	1
gave this in-laws cristmas they taking pictures next time we went visit . definitely buy additional memory , internal memory really more back-up	1
my husband got this me present i love it . easy use .	1
this simple flash just fills need somebody who wants better results than built-in flash nikon dslr camera without extra complexity . it what it , quite well . only controls unit itself on/off switch bounce angle . camera ittl function work , i no complaints results . just perfect solution get softer , more diffused lighting indoor photography allowing you bounce light rather than direct illumination . body quite compact , when mounted my d80 body not throw off balance my hands . it even compact enough fit inside some camera cases while still attached body . it also versatile you improvise bounce-diffuser low-cost . just cut piece 4x6 inkjet photo print paper same width flash , fold it " " shape mount it flash rubber band above just behind strobe . when flash pointed up bounce , some light gets reflected forward paper behind light fills subject little better . same $40+ aftermarket reflector/diffusers . sb-400 no means same job sb-800 , because flash made give more options professional more demanding situations . but somebody wanting flash simple indoor photography ( perhaps not large public hall ) where there desire bounce flash better photos , or shoot little bit longer range , this job not great deal money . it would better if light could swivel well angled upward more bounce options . if that important you , then sb-600 or sb-800 might right choice	1
although , my nikon d50 built flash but i got this any way . this help me taking indoor shots low light environment . if you afford it , get it . feature i most like it flsh angle . cons : takes aa battery . i would prefer chargeble option camera	1
its small works well , slightly better than built . nothing amazing but seems integrate nicely exposure/flash functio	1
good camera ! back all screen which great . good settings , good zoom , good quality . definitely recommend !	1
i also bought 512mb memory card it taking me forever use it up . i love how easy this camera use . my 4 year old neice figured it out . very user friendly . i would highly recommend this anyone . great quality pictures super long battery time	1
i got red one ! waited month or so this camera finally become available i love it . i also wanted camera i could put my pocket go ..... 35 mm digital camera .... found it too big lug around . am going cruise ( 17 days counting ! ) wanted compact camera . this camera unbelievable .... easy use , great pictures fun ! members my family taken it out my hand able immediately start using it . got some great pics 3 grandkids ... blew one up 8x10 ... beautiful picture . i too now carry my camera me all time gotten lot impromptu pictures ! battery life great ... also bought back up so not without while cruise . 2 mg high speed pro duo card .... not come close running out room ( i download periodically ! ) . if you looking compact camera easy use takes geat pictues ( good battery - my first digital camera ate batteries ... so this important me ! ) .... i highly recommend sony t100 - go red ... it cool !! oh ... love large screen too	1
this 4th sony camera i've each time they keep getting better ( which why i've bought 4 ) . this newest one , i got red , best looking camera i've seen ( everyone agrees ) . however , i few qualms it my first uses . 1st they got rid review button left hand side t-pad instead copied all other camera makers added view button top . while this works ok , i really miss able quickly go back last picture i took push delete button then take , it not huge deal , but it just takes more time . 2nd screen quality not nearly good other sony i've past . while it giant which nice , pixels fairly large i feel this lack resolution makes pictures look worse than they when they get computer . new face detection feature pretty neat , though i haven't really able tell what difference it makes . also i little upset high iso setting , i tried using it club not only it so dark picture useless , but it also soo grainy blurry nothing could identified . i'll experiment it more , but so far it bit let down . steady shot works pretty well , i've only slight blur one photo ( which expected hand got bumped ) all others perfect which quite welcome after my last camera without steadyshot blurred frequently . big disappointment me they got rid infolithium battery , i don't know if this because issues they've , or just because this one lasted longer or what , but it annoying not it say how many minutes i left i've gotten used it past 3 cameras them . still it not big deal , just kind annoying they got rid feature . 5x zoom very good , welcome over measly 3x older versions . size weight really good ( although it could bit slimmer it still almost inch thick ) . still it smaller than my wallet thick my cell phone , so i can't really complain . all all it great purchase so far i'm quite pleased , still sticking sony future this camera so much better than my friends ' casios canons	1
soon you charge battery first time , you take picture . quick start guide all information you need perform all common tasks camera . you use camera simple point shoot , or take advantage all its features . you snap pictures less than 2 seconds apart . great clarity until you reduce megapixels too much digital zoom , but camera tells you what your current mp level , so you monitor quality before you snap . i recommend extra battery card plenty extra memory so you snap unlimited photos then pick choose later . only drawback latch battery/memory door requires some dexterity open close . if you clumsy fingers , you'll want try open latch demo before you buy it . also read my comment scott rose review	1
this camera good any one travels wants good pixs family or places they visit . viewing area good size those " over 50 eyes " easier see when sun shinging than most . lcd blurry until pushing button which only negative i find . i expensive sony but this less bulky easier take plane . slips my purse	1
i purchased this camera replace olympus 400 . all all , it takes great pictures . image stabilization works very well . i took some test shots dawn freeway bridge ( low light conditions bouncing traffic)and camera performed excellently . shots turned out great . good color saturation , fairly sharp image . it also weather resistant 400 , which one major reasons i picked olympus . i camera " fry " because little rain during picture shoot . it seem go through battery power quicker than i would like , especially if it used outdoors cold . but i planned ahead buying two extra batteries just issue . lack optical viewfinder , screen use all time , i suspect major culprit . i usually turned off screen my older camera conserve battery life . many postings this most newer point shoot cameras , lack optical viewer critical flaw if shooting bright environments . reflected glare , dim screen images , you just can't see thing while composing your shot . just point , shoot , hope ! i looking digital slr next camera when i bought this camera . i'm not sure i'm through looking	1
i not used camera much , but like other stylus models i own ; it quite functional . i miss viewfinder because bright light make digital display little iffy . 5x optical zoom very nice . pocket size camera makes it extremely worthwhile me	1
small , good picture quality , rugged ... i've taken this camera camping , canoing , hiking , biking , etc . it covered scratches , it rain , yet it still takes great pictures . it fits pocket or backpack without any problem . i'd highly recommend this camera	1
after i lost my previous digital camera 3 foot fall , i looking digital camera could survive thrown around bit , also something i could take kayaking . optio 33wr seemed tailor-made my needs . first weekend i it i went hiking one dustier trails northern california , i came back some great shots banana slugs , redwoods hilly panoramas . camera didn't handle bright sunlight well i hoped ( some my panarama pictures bit washed out ) . however , you knock exposure down half steps manually ( which i came use frequently later ) . next day i tentatively dipped it under running sink , dried it off , waited it explode . happily it behaved though nothing happened . eventually , i took it kayaking , all day , salt water . it handled splash , salt , sun like champ . added bonus , batteries ( not default ones , but some fairly standard rechargeables i'd purchased seperately ) managed last whole trip ( 120 shots 4 hours water ) . i also got use phrase : " hang minute , i rinse off my camera " - there something cool saying . most recently camera survived 4 weeks backpacking , much which spent plains kenya . obviously , there not enough zoom make this " safari " camera , but it great capturing some spontaneous moments , some landscape shots braver wildlife . i found it hard get good picture lower light situations ( dusk or dawn ) . but anytime there some cloud cover during day pictures deep rich . quality photos quite what i'd expect 3mp camera . manual focus nice bonus , but autofocus responsive enough . zoom less then i would like , but still acceptable . digital camera features alone , i'd say this camera easy 3.5 or maybe 4 stars . freedom take it out water , get dirty generally abuse it push it up shining 5 stars	1
this summer i travel palestine attend wedding . last thing i wanted hall around ostentatious camera would break my back well problem check points border crossings . i picked sanyo xacti c6 . it great . size amazing , its big my cell phone , i laughed first becasue i didn't find it when i opend box . video quality great , ** it size ** i expecting picture realy blurry pixulated but it wasn't bad , more suprizing indoor videos night . however , still picture capabilities inferior movie capabilities . don't even think taking picture night . my trip camera fulfilled its duties flying colors . but then my family used it film highschool graduation ... boy disaster . movies wedding weren't very celebrated , but behind scenes great . again don't use it family moments ! now you might say why should i buy flawed camera price , its because you use it maybe 1000x more often than regular bulky video camera . many times i capture great vacation moments this camera situations where bulky camera wouldn't carried , just because this one placed pocket your pants	1
like many people , i debated debated , read countless reviews , watched prices weeks ... me , it pretty much came down e500 8mp rebel . ( 6mp pentax d100 running , too . ) finally , i pretty much decided based reviews e500 , it seemed like people who know their way around slr cameras enjoyed it , whereas complaints mostly seemed lack ease those coming ps camp . said , olympus make fine cameras . so canon . so nikon . i saw it , it pretty much like old ford verus chevy debate : just many people tell you why one superior other . when it comes down it , all cameras ( like all cars ) their stong points their weak points . depending what you're using camera , different aspects weigh more heavily than others . instance , me , price big concern . this , hands down , best deal . i picked up factory demo refurbished 2-lens kit . i don't think i list price review , but it cheapest among 8mp cameras . two lenses both made-for-digital . somewhat limited olympus ' 4/3 platform , but any camera you buy if you want good glass front it , you'll spending much body . or more . top line lenses not cheap ... anywhere , any maker . these zuiko lenses seem solid though , i can't complain them . i wish there more af options versus what basically amounts center-focus option only . there 3 , but they're very close center . minor irritation , though ; just focus your subject , hold shutter down halfway , then frame your shot . really no different than lining up those two circles older 35mm lenses . i like overall ergonomics camera . it just big enough it some heft , but not too heavy weigh you down . ( granted , i'm 6'1 " guy average-sized hands . ) however , it feel little plasticy , but coming pentax k-1000 , i think anything . worked photography-based company recent past , i got little spoiled nikon d1 series ; however , d50 ( lesser extent d70 ) felt more like toy . but e500 fits my hands nicely . i actually really like way lens sits almost all way over one side , ample grip opposite . makes strong handling vertical shots , even one-handed . photos great . very sharp , very crisp . colors nice vibrancy . tones balanced . i've seen few complaints noise higher isos , but i didn't see anything too out line . plus , there noise reduction , which takes it down pretty much nil . anything that left , nothing basic photo-editing program can't take care second . i think " blur " complaints people used ps photography . i've shot down 1/15 or so no more blur than expected . it just matter knowing how hold camera maintain firm stance . someone who loves black-and-white shooting , color filters momochrome mode nice touch . they really make images pop . i've happy all settings ; it lots scene modes , lots little ways tweak images you shoot , too ( high key/low key , vivid , muted , etc ) . flash sits up little higher than other cameras , too , so there less chance catching shadow closer shots . flash little bright slightly distracting when auto-focus focus-finding ( pre-flash ) . again , though , not huge deal . now menu little convoluted . it could more user-friendly intuitive . but it nothing reasonably adept photographer can't figure out after reading manual playing around little bit . second command wheel would nice , but hey , you're here economical camera , you're going cut few corners , i guess . all commands second wheel there , just back menu . some way set " hot buttons " or something could compensate some , too , but again ... think value . my only other " complaint , " which more just minor annoyance than anything , location power swith rear dial adjusting aperture and/or shutter speed . sometimes when changing settings , i'll trip power turn it off . startup quick , though , so it not biggie . sometime when repositioning myself moving camera around , i'll inadvertently change aperture or shutter ( depending which mode i'm shooting ) . either moving it more top , making it harder turn , or making some sort setting " lock " would help . anyway , bottom line : if you're 35mm slr user wanting make switch digital , price deciding factor , just go ahead get this camera . it solid camera takes great pictures , likely just good any other -- more expensive -- options . if you're impatient just want better point-and-shoot , get point shoot . if you're fancy-schmancy professional , why you looking this budget camera ? ;	1
product satisfactory - you would not expect any less olympus . shipping associated wait ? story ! i chose free shipping ( kick , kick ! ) thought product would reach me 5 9 days . no - it would " ship " 5 9 days wherever it . so , next 9 business days , i watched my order - product sat warehouse . i tempted cancel get it via overnight shipping couple times - or try prime shipping one-off thing - but would not fair , right ? painstakingly , product moved came tantalizingly close - 15 miles where i live - sat ups warehouse 2 more days . last time ups supposed deliver , it just noted " premises closed " - when i home waiting package all through 8 hour window - around 2 pm day delivery , i started getting feeling ups would find lock dangling my place . ultimately , it not turn out case . overall , it took more than 12 days travel 100 miles or so . rub it , battery took hours hours charge - it takes 8 10 hours charge fully . so , if you hurry , not order free shipping add 10 hours ups window estimate time you would first use camera . results camera - excellent . i prefer use xd card order avoid bulk number pins ( go out alignment - see post this trail ) cf card . xd card , my experience , extremely stable used one 3+ years . also , if you rm-1 older oly , you use remote here well ! reason i deducted 1 star .. my patience ran thin sh process	1
i amateur photographer 20+ years . time i semi-loyal olympus fan . ( i admit i cheated canon couple point shoots ) . this great dslr someone looking carry their photography hobby digital world or someone looking start new hobby . it not easiest camera use . meaning you need read manual learn icons . picture quality amazing . ability manipulate picture without entering full manual mode also very impressive . size perfect . cannon dslr little compact my hand provide stable platform when shooting . olympus fits just right . ( my hands not huge . ) downside : accessories very expensive limited . kit included excellent satiate appetite most amateur photogs , especially when purchased optional starter kit camera ( extra battery , bag , remote , etc . ) but , before you buy this camera , imagine yourself wanting wide angle lens , or more powerful telephoto . now take look online ... not too impressive ? this area cannon dslr excels	1
bought this go pink camera i bought my 12 yr old daughter xmas . nicely made , protects camera it looks cute !	1
i can't say whether this camera better or worst than f30 , but i say camera excellent . i've using casio ex-z750 last 18 months , it tremendous outdoor performer . it also more compact , viewfinder manual mode . that where advantages end . indoor shots always required flash , flash invariable gave skin strongly unnatural pallor . contrast , f31fd indoor shots without flash superb . i recently took over 200 shots seminar where i could not use flash . skin tones very natural/accurate noise iso 400 or less virtually non-existent . iso800 , noise noticeable , but shots usable . shots iso 1600 also usable , but substantial detail lost . fd worked , but subject looking your direction . also , longest zoom , camera would default iso 1600 auto mode . i found if i zoomed halfway , i could keep iso down 400 ( preferred ) or lower . images little soft , which okay , but might problem if you don't want use photoshop or similar . i haven't taken many outdoor shots . that not why i purchased camera . however , i suspect it fine . most cameras . some dislikes : i wish it viewfinder , i wish it smaller , i wish i could use fd non-automatic mode ( or least prevent iso creeping over 400 ! ) . these not major dislikes . i'm more than happy trade off these minor niggles great performance	1
adapter worked just fine , but one small fault it blocks flash . it just something i failed take into account	1
i received this battery camera thought silly little thing would not last any longer aa , but i suprized . i took 200 pictures it before it finally died half those flash . after it sat my desk almost year . resort aa last night went through 6 aa batteries 40 pictures . so i am going get more becuase it works out cheaper it less hassle .	1
there numerous complaints supplemental image this product amazon website . however , vendors ( such adorama ) send correct item . lastly , this battery far outperforms regular aa batteries , especially if you flash-happy	1
excellent set binoculars -- exquisitely stable details , easy use . my wife never liked use binoculars , but she thinks these great .	1
we live edge bay fair amount bird boat watching . we've using binoculars five months now find them great purpose . we use them constantly feature takes annoying flutter away . we would like get pair car . can't recommend them highly enough	1
this cam since last april 2006 i put some microphone foam over microphones which eliminated any wind noise didnt change exsiiting quailty stereo recording . wind noise filter wasnt enough cut out all wind noise . camera amazing considering its size best part it slipped my front pants pocket goes unnoticed there when you need it ! low light video recording grainy when yuo set asa 400 but so 35mm slrs when using 400 speed film few years back get same feeling this cam . low light auto focusing touch go just give cam time focus or manully set focus . awesome closeup pics both still video mode get down 1/2 " away subject so close lens produce shadow image . i always shoot 5meg size get 700 some pics 2gb card i 4 those weekend events . this price small size i am 100% sold this cam but i use shoot 35mm slr 2-3 lens etc camera bag over shoulder now just this tiny cam my pocket i get both still hd video really amazing . you get better hd still pics but not anything fits front pants pocket !	1
just got camera what i've seen so far it wonderful piece equipment . my only complaint amazon misrepresented battery type saying it , " powered en-el3a or en-el3 " which not true disappointing anyone who upgrading camera use those batteries ( ie d70 ) d200 uses en-el3e which doesn't same fit en-el3a or en-el3 . aware this if you upgrading	1
i waiting affordable nikon digital slr which i could use my older nikon lenses ( ai , series , etc . ) . i know , i could spent thousands d2 , but would overkill me . suffice say , d200 joy use . it fast , solid , intuitive . those owners nikon film slrs who considering d200 , me it " feels " just like nikon film slr . i previously owned several high-end digital point shoot cameras , d200 blows them away terms its capabilities , degree control it offers , resulting quality pictures you take it . it all features advanced amateur photographer could possibly want . i'll probably never even scratch surface all its features , but its nice know they're there if i want or need them . i highly recommend d200 anyone who , like me , waiting right digital slr come	1
i bought this camera after dpreview told me it ( well , actually , its leica sibling ) fits all my needs , namely : compact , raw , aperture priority , plus optical stabilization . what i like : large screen , raw , fairly decent flashwhat i dislike : it actually takes raw + jpeg which wastes space my card . however , it gives me interesting comparison . 90% time , i prefer raw version , albeit tweaked . jpeg colors just don't look right me . i'm also unimpressed image stabilization , warranty just terrible . 90 days ??? what ? also , manual focus without viewfinder takes getting used . i won't argue there noise higher isos , but it not nearly bad i expected other reviews . i haven't decided yet whether i'm keeping camera ; if you're not hurry , hold off see if they release new version summer . course , their track record , they won't fix any problems , just squeeze few more mp out chip	1
i've this camera month . i currently own nikon d50 2 year old canon powershot . i needed something small handy use walk around camera . i've reading reviews months various digital cameras , poured through thousands images posted flickr , i decided this camera . i loved look , size , price , leica lens . images sharper colors more vibrant than my nikon d50 my canon powershot . i love manual settings available this camera . i mostly use setting . although adjusting shutter speed aperture awkward using joystick , menu very simple offers lot control . i also like fact people stop me street whenever i use my camera	1
fantastic camera ! nikon legend lives ! great bright screen , great pictures , video , so much more . amazon cheapest price anywhere	1
i like my new panasonic recorder ( you might consider next model up before you buy ) . what i would really like review performance amazon . first unit i bought performed marginally , so first chance i got i exchanged it amazon . they took care problem , replacing it new camera . they moved problem so fast my jaw dropped . i could not believe how quickly professionally amazon took care situation ! i am old enough little reluctant use internet , but amazon gives me confidence know if its not right , it , quickly ! thanks amazon	1
when you die go heaven , if you where kind hearted photographer great eye , st peter gives you nikon d200 this 18-200mm vr zoom . get most out this lens user needs carefully learn its digital features part nikon d200 system . this lens much more zoom composition aid . it worth attending car , boat or horse race just play image stabilization ( vr ) capabilities . if you born rich or worked way too hard your life just buy one !!	1
i've this lens month now what wonder it . i've out photography 30 years but am still beginner . i read lot this purchase internet it overwhelmingly positive . it pays research . i am selling my nikon 55-200mm but keeping my kit 18-55mm backup . i also love my d40 . probably pick up 50mm 1.8 indoor . highly rated also .	1
overall , very nice product price . i would liked lights bit more powerful	1
i actually less powerful binocular than this one , but it bushnell permafocus technology . i can't even begin describe how amazing it never focus your binoculars . you just look through , whatever you're looking , regardless distance ( except very close-up ) , focus ! it like camera auto-zoom . my husband wears glasses rather strong prescription , he see perfectly clearly through these binoculars without his glasses . he just takes them off , it if he never wears them	1
these glasses small , protable good concerts quick bird work . i keep set car , but they not replace my larger busnells birding . please don't expect more than little backyard birding these , i am now adjusted my larger set , so i use those yard . you get what you pay	1
what not like ? light , compact comes strap , case wipe cloth . they perfect . keep mind 12 power more challeging hold still	1
these great little binoculars i use quite often . they so compact lightweight i grab them whenever i leave house - whether it boat ride around lake or just quick ride . i don't see quite well when i leave my eyeglasses it take little bit more adjusting get focus right eyeglasses , but they great pair binoculars price . i am very impressed quality them .	1
this my first telescope i am very satisfied my purchase . portability ease use high points - you set it top car trunk start using it seconds . gives clear bright views deep sky objects such nebulas clusters . it not best option however watching planets its short focal lenght requires high power eyepieces high magnification you pay this field view eyepiece relief - other words if you want see planets up close , your field view narrow you keep your eye real close eyepiece ( plus you need buy additional eyepieces ) . sum , excellent option amateur use . if this your first time well , get good guidebook ( " nightwatch " dickinson very good pick ) also pair binoculars help you find your way around sky - this piece advice first timers tend not heed then realize how hard it find objects relatively narrow field view their telescope offer	1

nikon d200 amazing camera . this review amazon packing procedures . this review alert prospective buyers amazon not pack these cameras well . i just purchased one it came packed like book , very little padding . i called nikon their recommendation return item pronto . i returned camera ( much trepidation)and purchase trusted source . just wanted give you all heads up	1
my first professional digital slr nikon d1x . i got great pictures it but it too large heavy lug around extended periods . i also some issues its operation . but now , nikon seems solved my issues d200 . i purchased dedicated sb-800 flash 18-200 lens recommended d200 manual . whole system much improved over my other digital slr . both focus metering seem work more reliably . it works better available light . optical anti-vibration aids overall picture sharpness ( plus those us who not rock-steady ) . i am getting use button sequence required enlarge picture preview really like amount magnification possible . menuing system seems quite extensive well-organized . i would like more latitude picture quality settings ( e.g. contract , saturation , sharpness ) . help screens really tell me something when i'm confused . i appreciate " modeling " feature . it useful when attempting compose dark situation . it also lets me see reflections before they committed picture . unfortunately this feature not work using built-in flash . i wish nikon could add some type lock continuous-single-manual focus selector front camera . my finger seems move switch unknowingly . i would appreciate battery charger built plug rather than detachable cord . person who still wears thick glasses , i wish nikon could make viewfinder more like one their old n8008 . or maybe it time away pentaprisoms mechanical mirrors give us truly pro camera mimics high-end pro-sumer models electronic viewfinders adjustable view screens	1

i sticked sony since i got my first digital camera 4 years ago sony camera moneys worth ! this one dsc-t10 one parent who carrying much already needs pack down change . it fits my purse still space more , only thing remember buy slim fitting case camera extra battery(for those kind battery not sold everywhere ) you need one when you don't thing you need extra battery , you always run out wrong time . i recommend this one	1
first all , this camera every feature any beginner - intermediate - professional photographer could ask . macro / zoom capabilities outstanding , little practice use tripod or patient steady hand . use top lcd ( waist level ) best way shoot low level shots , otherwise rear lcd fine everything else . too many features list , ( read manual all features ) but main one shots this camera produces excellent . i suggest using photoshop editing , any good photographer attest . want see many more photos taken this camera ? see : [ nekophoto . com ] big bang buck what this camera all	1
i've read over all reviews i don't agree them . starters , i don't think this camera difficult use . this my first digital camera ever , i'm not problems using it . pictures crisp clear ; i'm very impressed quality pictures camera . if i one complaint it would straps handle keep coming undone i really feel quality could better ; i've 2 instances which my new camera almost crashed ground so my advice not carry thing around handle	1
traveled abroad this . multi-voltage , no cords ( though it obscure 2nd socket if it go top one any reason ) . charges 2 once , which really convenient , but note it takes almost 2x long doing one	1
takes excellent photos . love zoom . feels good your hands .	1
soon i got camera i could tell it good one instruction manual . i'm still reading learning how us it . my husband i enjoy trying out different features we'er pleased pictures we've taken . we highly recommend this camera both novis more experience photographer .	1
camera really very compacy nice . it easily fits into your pocket . very useful if you want take quick picture . only concern i you cannot change dpi ( dots per inch ) camera . you take 5mp resolution pictures but if dpi small it doesnt really help when you zoom . dpi limited 72 . such it not great concern unless you want zoom pictures take	1
i make movies this camcorder good result , but feel snapes noice . i think it not too much resulation . if you spend more mony then you buy high resulation panasonic or sony camcorder else it enough choice your budge .	1
i've digital cameras before , but this one it all . if you want take really good pictures your life then buy this camera . hp photosmart m527 6mp digital camera 3x optical zoom more features than i'll commonly use , but i think all them come handy specific settings . easy use great photo quality	1
really suprised how easy this camera use great photo quality . zoom great ! don't really care easyshare software .	1
i upgraded old 2 megapixel easyshare , boy am i glad i . it very eay use , pictures come out great . i find display looks little grainy , but pictures never come out way . lens cover comes off very easily , i am not fond kodak software	1
sigma doesn't seem third-party lens company any longer . i like this super-wide angle lens . considering its price , sharpness well color awesome . also , it very quiet hypersonic motor . comparison tokina 12-24 , it 2mm more but 2mm quite big crop body ( nikon 1.5 ) . if i mention its drawbacks , i would say this lens applied only digital slr camera its aperture f/4- 5.6 .	1
this case just it looks , but it would helpful strap you put your shoulder or handle or something . if you don't care straps , then i would recommend this case you	1
pack holds two en_el3 batteries makes holding camera even easier . checking battery power you determine exactly what percentage power left each battery . it ' heavy , but i like camera	1
i've always hated how cumbersome it shoot verticals 35mm digital : contort one arm over head , twist wrist , etc . this pretty much solves problem . granted , it difficult reach thumb pad camera , but least you use af-on button front wheel change focus areas . build quality ? i figure nikon went plastic minimize weight cost . i wish latch battery door bit more robust , however . it changes balance camera , making it feel much more ' centered ' , especially my goto lens , 18-200mm vr . it also much better balanced my sb-600 flash attached . overall , i'd say this ' must ' , probably second accessory you should get after flash unit . oh yes , it also tends command r-e-s-p-e-c-t people , good or bad ..	1
amazing , this essential accessory proven more than invaluable . mb-d200 attached your nikon d-200 you not only extra power small package additional grip controls take vertical shots , but , you also maximize battery use take full advantage nikon built-in battery monitor . this feature not only tells you percentage battery life left , it also tells you number photos taken specific battery . furthermore , camera so smart , it first uses one battery then other . thus making it no-brainer which battery needs recharged . seconds , battery menu tells you each battery status one glance . only regret removal voice recorder included mb-d100 battery pack nikon d-100 . perhaps nikon bring this feature back- it very helpful when trying quickly identify photos assignments	1
i bought this camorder around 3 months ago so far i am very happy it . first off let me say i am complete amateur when it comes camcorders . i lot research online though before buying this particular camcorder saw nothing but positive reviews 3 ccd camcorder i only paid $400 it , which same good 1 ccd camcorder . i 20 month old baby i use it primarily home video footage . i able take it out box use it very quickly . i keep setting ' auto ' most time works just fine me . picture quality excellent , colors vibrant camcorder easy use . i read lot camcorders not performing well ' low light situations ' this camera pretty well , even though i notice when i shoot video my basement ( which not very bright ) picture slightly grainy . however when room bright or when i am outside picture incredible . zoom not great but i am not shooting more than 10 feet away anyway , so doesnt bother me . i am going buy video light see how improves my indoor video . overall , i am extremely happy this camcorder highly recommend it	1
very sensitive cold weather . pouts not put its lens out if left jeep overnight montana even if it spring there only light flurry evening . i just getting everything set perfectly ( yes , it taken me 4 years ) when lens quit extending . it now paperweight or doorknob art . it still read cards ... plus , door knob art , i think . i saw one person whose camera didn't work them winter very well all , mine worked fine while dog sledding other great times montana this camera moved florida all once . shooting it fully automatic you would cheap compact , you miss out many features , not mention : many good photos dawn through dimly lit club wee hours ~ ~ all without flash . if you read manual , you work this camera , which ways personalize settings without worries you always " return default " without concern . mine enjoyed over exposing when running free fully automatic full daylight . i wish it would better identifying moving targets selecting shorter exposures , even rapid mode . these problems aside , camera itself capable very good photos . advised , this could point shoot , but get photos you really want , decisions must made ! i don't believe this casual photographer only interested point-and-shoot . feel basic photography concepts : using aperture or timing priority or fully manual ; knowing what effects iso exposure compensation , etc . these all explained enough manual you operate camera enough enjoy it , i think . if you know how use picasa , simplest way add uv filter , i think , you don't even need buy proprietary click version actually place camera make your photos look more appealing professional . go go irish gypsy my space page see photos all taken this camera . i strongly recommend spending few hours advanced manual camera learning properly how exposure , white balance focus controls work . it really pay off ! what you see approximately 1 knuckle length wide 1.5 knuckle long display screen what you get . though it difficult see itsy bitsy screen bright daylight , this camera really shines dim light help things like white balance make sure you don't get false sepia tone makes things look so awful dim light photos image stabilizer mode , which i used even tripod , case i forgot turn it back . either way , this camera ate batteries like bear huckleberries . my battery recharger worn out !! i'll replacing camera recharge . all all , worth cost purchasing camera first digital camera . it bulky , i miss out some great shots because i didn't feel like hauling camera me some particular excursion . i hope my replacement take shots nicely . ~~~~~~ may i say i purchased this through here amazon darn fine job !!	1
this camera good response time , nice picture quality ( you would expect canon ) , excellent battery life ( i use 2500 mah rechargeable batteries ) . low light performance very good too	1
i this camera 2 years now . before i bought this camera i smaller camera 3x zoom . i didn't really miss zoom option my previous camera but now i 10x zoom powershot s1 i'm not sure how i could live without it past . camera takes good pictures it easy operate . you use predefined modes if you want .. or you adjust lot stuff manually if you into :-) only problems this camera size lens cap . it " big " bulky ... no , it not big slr camera but it still bit bit stick your pocket when you going out friday night . camera lens keeps falling all time it not big problem but time time lens gets dirty due this problem . i posted lots pictures taken this camera my homepage ( check profile ) . all pictures nyc trip until today taken camera . conclusion : i would not hesitate recommend powershot s1 ( or new s2 ) people i know : -	1
i use this golf yardage when i'm location where yardage hard determine . very accurate . require steady hand . would not recommend more magnification than this one it would very difficult hold steady enough target small flag	1
my husband i bought this case cruise we took over holidays . we absolutely so glad we ! yes , waterseal ring little wierd figure out first , but really , once you get down , this case cinch ! i absolutely love able take video underwater well photos . here we , swimming sting rays i capture every moment it ! i can't reccomend this case more . just follow instructions beware what they say using flash without diffuser --- it true , image gets all funky if you use flash without it , so don't . otherwise , very simple user friendly .	1
i read reviews i little nervous putting my camera case some people claimed leaked . i took my camera jamaica loaded it into case ( carefully reading following instructions ) it work out great . pics turned out awesome , camera safe water . i recommend this anyone who interest taking their camera or near water . if you want your underwater pictures come out well , you definitely need put camera underwater setting . because neutralization blue hues you cannot take pictures things more than 20 feet away without there blurred or hard see items . if you switch camera setting pictures come out overly blue or blurred . thing , it easy switch camera modes . just aware what mode you're . thing watch out if you using camera around water , but not necessarily water , sometimes water spots get lens leave good picture some blurry marks . it easily taken care dipping camera water letting water naturally run off or using clean cloth wipe away water . avoid touching inside case , finger prints very annoying try look through while underwater or some type sun glaze	1
this not case frills . camera fits snugly inside but there no room anything else such battery charger or even case memory card . it feels flimsier than i expected but so far i no problems workmanship , so attribute may just my interpretation .	1
fits fine , but its little hard get it fast , it goes well design .	1
product arrived well packed great working order . we paid extra overnight delivery so i would it before leaving town . it arrived day late i buy one . my return i advised amazon problem promptly refunded extra overnight charge . thanks ! that why i use amazon .	1
not bad , whole , watching wildlife dark . good illumination nice balance magnification , field view , use w/o tripod . sharpness falls off edges viewing area . i could recommend this wildlife watchers who might considering their first night-vision device . since this my first , i no comparative information whether there might better ones out there	1
this got best camera money you buy right now !! i looking affordable camera , small thin , well-known name brand , takes sharp digital photos , shoot low light , uses cheap sd cards , good-sized lcd display , take decent videos . well , this casio exilim everything more , great price . i used it so much during my out-of-state travels without running out power or memory ( i bought 2gb sd card $20 [ ... ] i take more 1000 hi-res photos or hour video ) . i absolutely surprised how good videos i shoot this small digital camera , now i decided not buy new video camcorder , this casio exilim all i would need any occasion . if you're market great camera , look no further than casio exilim	1
my experience , this camera takes great pictures , but zoom lens so delicate it breaks easily . it stops extending just makes clicking noise . this happened me when camera accidentally turned while my pants pocket rendering camera unusable . my brother two my friends experienced similar problem their ex-s500 after they accidentally dropped camera while lens extended . i would recommend looking into camera not so delicate	1
it must addition a530 camera , especially when learning use camera , running slide shows tv . saves big time batteries !!! only reason i rated it less than 5 stars it little large	1
case works what i need it just carry around my digital camera .	1
i wanted something could take some wear tear easy carry so after lot consideration i chose this case . excellent choice , it " cushioned , long strap , very lightweight . not pretty ... but functional	1
my wife got me this camera christmas greatest feature it i not charge batteries once since i got it ( 4 months now ) . during time i took approximately 600 pictures made 20 videos . it perfect non-professional photographer . makes it easy choose setting various occassions ( party , indoor , night , panorama , etc . ) it takes great overal pictures . i think this camera great people who like take occassional pictures friends , partys or vacation . good buy price . i would definately recommend i t.p.s. get least 512 mb memory card	1
i just purchased this camera easier travel use . my main camera nikon d70s but it too big travel easily . canon sd750 very compact camera . camera not come carrying case so i purchased leather case which i think necessary addition . video somewhat grainy full screen except 640 mode ( 30 fps ) which seems quite good very watchable 20 inch computer monitor full screen . still picture quality excellent . side side pictures my nikon show comperable quality which quite amazing such small package . camera easy use . i purchased 2 gb extreme card which i think perfect my use , especially video . 2 gb card appears give me 15 minutes video 640 resolution . all all camera exceeded my expectations	1
canon resumes its position top all camera manufacturers . their design , performance , quality hard match . now onto camera : i shot around 4-5 gigs worth photos various settings , so i good idea what this camera offer . features itself within camera excellent . aside increased megapixels , it not much different than sd700 except some odd reason , canon decided opt out ( image stabilization ) feature . i almost gave it 4 stars based solely aspect . but other than , camera brilliant . portraits close-ups , face detection feature phenomenal which reflection new digic iii technology . camera lock human face or multiple faces ( i've locked up 8 ) keep it focus no matter where you move or pan camera . if you're shooting indoors or low-light , iso set high 1600 so you lot flash exposure control if you don't like spotlight look when using flash . there also auto iso setting which gives user lot range shoot . it determine proper iso setting shutter speed also predict camera shake resulting less blurry pictures . i guess this makes up not . :) if you novice photographer don't like mess iso , aperture settings , shutter speed variations this camera fit your needs just fine . it 17 shooting modes including " scene " modes different settings you may shooting such beach , fireworks , snow , portraits , night , etc . fully automatic so any beginner pick up this camera shoot like pro . most popular feature 3 " lcd screen . it ginormous . but order get big screen such compact camera , canon forgoes optical viewfinder . so if you're viewfinder shooter , then you may not like fact you limited just lcd screen image framing . one shortcoming camera it still weak zoom . 3x optical nothing so zoom feature pretty much non-existent . movie features camera awesome . i like time lapse movies where you record time lapse up 2 hours condense it into 4 or 8 minute movie . so if you want make cool " cloud moving " effect or " budding flower " you accomplish this camera . video resolution excellent vga frame rate 30fps . overall , camera satisfies all users simple enough use beginners also boasting features professional appreciate . it also looks bitchin two tone effect people admire . corners intelligently rounded so it slips easily out any pocket you may want put it .	1
incredible price size . very clear secure . good deal	1
i've used this since 2001 extensively 2006 now it usga legal . not sure why others trouble holding this steady . anything lt ; 200 yards i no problem hitting flag ( you don't aim stick , you aim flag ) . excellent getting distances bunkers , trees , other hazards . 200 over it difficult me hit flag , but all you wait someone pull or reinsert pin , you beam it off player . inside 150 i've never problem getting distance . i learned first laser object behind pin ( such tree ) , then move up pin so i know sure i'm getting flagstick not tree background . my dad " pinseeker " model it quicker easier beam off small object , but it also lot more expensive ... it larger .	1
so far i've this camera week im am pleased everything . its actually my 10th digital camera i think i've finally found one i like . it takes beautiful pictures , film good movies it also great sound . its also smaller than any other camera i've bought better looking . i think it takes pictures better night though sometimes good thing . buy it cause its very nice !!	1
bought this camera my teenage daughter who wanted something sleek . camera all powerful too . photo quality excellent camera easy operate . video feature works very well , also . my daughter found controls intuitive enough she hardly look user manual . battery life good although you can't charge it without removing battery . extracting inserting battery pretty straightforward not inconveinient you might think . this easy pick solid , versatile camera	1
easily best tripod i've ever owned , including some considerably more expensive ones . only problem remote . you must turn video camera before connecting . when camera turns off automatically , disconnect wire , turn camera , plug remote back . what pain	1
i absolutely love this frame !! i bought their smaller frame months ago , it great ! i get so many compliments it , i'm so happy see this larger one this amazingly low price ! wow .. i'm buying it mother day , one my husbands office ! way , i've great customer service these folks ! love it !	1
i gave my mom this frame gift her birthday . i just put 300 or so pictures old memory card i uploading them through my camera usb connection , then removed card my camera plugged it into frame it . she loves it everyone birthday dinner really wowed when i lifted cloth i covering it it moving through photos i choose . also , i like frame construction because it seems better made than others i seen . true there not much way instructions it works best if you extra memory card you not using you just keep frame all times . memory cards so cheep now i upgraded mine 2 gig gave her my smaller one	1
case cost $5 , shipping $15 . this case suggested my newly purchsed kodak v705 purchase . guess what--doesn't fit !! it worth returning -- no . so i've got great case that too small . should never suggested this product	1
if you kodak v550 or v530 model , you should buy this case , it beatiful perfect fit those cameras . it must buy item . much more important then spare battery ( i bought one never use ...	1
it fits my sd550 wonderfully could throw extra memory card/battery case well . i love material yes you really fit case your pocket	1
after reading product details section amazon kodak schneider-kreuznach xenar 1.4 55mm telephoto lens ( combined paucity available information elsewhere ) , i expecting receive lens measuring 2 1 1 � inches ...... advertised ! go take look . those figures you read too ? what surprise then open package discover this hugely massive lens unit . yup , first thing i check see if what i received what i ordered ... 8756488 ...... it . actuality , lens measures more than two inches diameter base where it connects lens adapter , three inches length exceeds three inches diameter objective face . hold your thumb forefinger three inches apart take look . lot glass ! adapter coupled 1.4 lens adds full five inches length camera , comes close ( just hefting each hand ) doubling weight my p880 camera . this date , no other reviews mention this discrepancy , which why i am bringing issue up . i am rather thrilled i this massive impressive looking piece photographic equipment ... but it sure not camera i stick my pocket , if it comes down camera hanging my shoulder all day hike , i'm going giving serious thought doing it second much smaller camera . i update this review when i more experience using lens . now , giving it 4 star so not skew current ratings . awesome looking piece serious equipment !! i added picture it shown my kodak p880 so you see yourself just how much lens this .	1
purchase my telephoto lens really great investment . i love way it brings objects closer view my photo taking	1
nice camcorder . easy use . see tapes right away unlike digital camcorders . this gift my 14 year old grandaughter she loves it	1
perfect family , mother , child , everybody ! i've it 4 moths its perfect . i take all pictures i want , etc etc . everybody loves color ! loved it ! buy it !	1
i love this camera . color great , so fun makes me feel unique . screen great size , it takes great pictures . good red eye issue . menu great too , when you scroll thru things , it tells you what it so you don't memorize it all . takes fast pictures , but not one after , like i hoping . but it open fast . don't fooled big memory , you still need larger card . depending size pic you want , you take 30 50 pics memory alone . but all all i love this camera it great buy	1
sony w55 followup successful popular w50 . it very good compact camera , easy carry easy use , reasonably priced - so most people happy it . not much changed w50 , which this case good thing ! one change w55 7 mp camera , rather than w50 6mp . honestly , that not big plus , they haven't made sensor catches light any larger . same ( good ) lenses , same size sensor = same ( good ) pictures , but not better . ( though it might help little features like smart zoom . ) obvious change course colors . don't make too much fun ! there 4 dsc-w series cameras our family , colors would kept my mother-in-law taking my sister camera home her . little personalization good thing . internal memory expanded ( 56mb ) , but i've never used internal memory cameras it , so i'm not sure matters much . it might worth knowing how use backup , dozen or two shots if your card full , or you some other problem . controls , menus interface w55 reasonably easy use . example , w55 easy access various scene modes ( twilight , etc ) , some explanation screen what those mysterious little icons mean ( so you might actually use them , since it tells you what they ! ) . if you're new digital photography , there learning curve . but if you've used other cameras much , especially sonys , you pick this up use many features right away . read short introductory guide comes camera , though ! rechargeable battery should easily last you full day shooting - hundreds shots - no problem . ( little wise turning it off when you're not using it ! ) so you probably don't need second battery , unless you're going into woods while . it nice not mess bulky aa rechargeables . also , lithium ion batteries don't memory effect , so don't worry partial recharging . just charge battery each night . so - before getting second battery , try it while see if you need it . but get case - something protect screen , least . fully closed one might help resist rain splashes little , too . you'll also want get memory stick pro duo card - pro cards faster , you need smaller duo size this camera . get 1-2gb card so you don't think running out memory too much - if you shop carefully , you find them so little these days it well worth avoiding running out memory . you might want spare card if you plan travel more than week , or use video mode often - which surprisingly good ( though bit dark ) if set fine , but uses enormous amounts storage setting . you stretch your memory , your hard drive space , using one lower-resolution settings take snapshots . you don't really need 7mp all your photos ! w55 take better photos than those credit-card type cameras tiny lens system - optics always make difference camera . any reasonable person very happy pictures w55 , given size it . camera little slow often take disappointing pictures low light dark situations . try high iso mode low light no-flash situations - picture quality suffers some , but most people find it useful . realistically , no ultra-compact camera work really well situation - if you need often , think something bigger lens bigger sensor . good light always gives best pictures any camera . there limits what you currently expect any ultracompact camera . w55 offers enough controls ( through scene modes program mode ) allow fair amount control over pictures , automatic camera . charger fairly compact rated 100-240v , so while you'll need plug adapter overseas you won't need voltage converter . battery charger little slow , though probably ok . keep this camera charged handy , you'll find you take lot pictures because it easy carry easy use	1
i've only camera few days , so i hope write more encompassing review later . but i'm writing now clarify movie function dmc-lz7 record sound ... i read ( maybe product specs ) there no sound , so i quite happy discover otherwise ! i purchased camera its low-light abilities thought i give up sound get it -- so glad i wrong . note : nearly-identical dmc-lz6 not record sound . lack sound-recording size lcd monitor ( lz7 2.5 inch screen , lz6 2-inch screen ) seem only differences models . certainly worth extra $30 or so get dmc-lz7 sound . dmc-lz7k movie quality good digicam . my only comparison my 4-5 year old canon elph -- it much better than . old elph only records approx 15 second clips , lumix keep going until you fill up your card . one might expect , there noticable chromatic noise using iso settings above 800 -- but even manual says setting basically only suitable 4x6 prints . but least you get picture extreme conditions , even if quality less than optimal . again , comparing my old camera - 1200 iso lumix looks like 400 iso my old elph . lumix 400 iso looks great , least monitor . i haven't printed anything yet . shutter response time good i no major complaints , least not so far . i'm using rechargable aa batteries sandisk extreme iii 1gb card . both working well this camera .	1
very nice product . completely protects camera without hindering any operation . there simple velcro flap pull down take pictures - that it . very good inclement weather picture taking regular use well . you not remove camera case even replace digital cards or battery - just unzip bottom . this case little pricy , but perfect hp series camera	1
bought it connect my new sony hd3 hdv camcorder my sony kdf60xbr950 . works perfect	1

good it claims . great golf hunting . easy use good eye relief adjustment or without glasses .	1
this thing works exactly advertised . i use it golf , it very good job separating flag other background objects , even when wind or my over-caffeinated hands make it hard get target centered flag . even works when there no wind flag hanging straight down . this well worth cost adder over cheaper ones don't work nearly well	1
i get bandwagon here . this superb little camera , definately five stars ! i also tz1 , which showed promise , but limitations . my review tz1 , i noted it lots " noise " pictures shouldn't printed much beyond 4x6 inches if they sharp . i also wanted more manual controls . tz3 fixes improves almost everything tz1 adds some new , very useful features . noise drastically reduced , lens better , sensor bigger , processor not only faster , but produces better pictures . tz3 adds very handy " function " button - or i should say function capability - number buttons same - which gives immediate access five or so " most used " settings without go into menues - which there several . tz3 keeps mega optical image stabilization adds intelligent iso , increases sensitivity without adding noise , ( i not tried 3200 setting yet . ) , increases size viewing screen , etc ., etc . tz3 " well-rounded , " very capable camera . there simply no comparison tz1 tz3 far quality pictures . tz3 wins hands down . my opinion it also beats some big name , higher priced digicams - couple which i own - rather handily . course , big selling point tz3 still 10x lens - now wide angle capability - pocket-sized point shoot camera . this lens sharp , combined larger sensor new processor yields some excellent results . while there no manual controls , per se , camera seems very well without them . pictures sharp , exposures seem nicely ( haven't tried it night yet , but low light forrest shots excellent ) , colors accurate , appropriately saturated , vivid ( ok . i like vivid setting . ) , good contrast , etc . there variety af settings , settable focal points , focus modes . there also exposure compensation , exposure bracketing available - they work well ! live histogram welcome bonus . tz3 focuses down 2 inches macro mode - again excellent , sharp results . tz3 very well speced out . one nice thing gone lens cap tz1 . it really not inconvenient , but seemed always swinging wind add yet source camera shake . tz3 lens includes built lens cover . very welcome . i currently own five top flight digicams ( including this one ) , owned many others , i am most impressed this one - combined convenience results . it quantum step forward . i also couple quite nice , fairly complete dslr kits . they wonderful , class themselves , but when i want very nice pictures convenience pocketable point shoot 10x , wide angle lens , or back up dslrs , tz3 now my camera choice .	1
i torn sony panasonic ( canons seemed many recurring complaints especially decks ) , after reading several reviews became gradually partial panasonic , before ever used one , based customer loyalty consistently glowing testimonials . well i've never used comparable sony , jvc , or canon xl2 ( some limited experience gl2 ) , but best i tell without personal comparison this camera fact deserve all great reviews . image quality excellent many cases looks good broadcast tv video ( nonhd ) , camera allows tremendous amount image control -- manual focus ring , aperture ( iris ) , gain adjustment , shutter speed , zebra control overexposure , white black balance adjusting , daylight filters , etc . electronic viewfinder even focused via simple diopter . there six preprogrammed , but customizable , settings image control so user simply dial whatever setting they need based shooting/lighting conditions . so , example , you shoot occasionally under weak flourescents lights -- you adjust white balance gain detail level accordingly , save it particular " scene file " ; whenever you return same location or similar shooting environment , you click over saved settings instant start recording . first four factory set video 60 frames ; last two 24 fps more film-like quality , which this camera handles beautifully . what actually sold me camera , terms hardware , two xlr jacks -- comparably priced models didn't seem offer this . xlr jacks allow user attach professional shotgun mics bypass mediocre factory one , taking fuller advantage 16bit 48khz stereo recording . i use fairly inexpensive azden mic improvement sound quality tremendous . if you willing invest finer mics audio quality would better still . two xlr inputs means addition recording live audio ( like mic ) you also mix input pre-recorded source -- all camera ! lens leica also impressive -- it bit wide not interchangeable ( although i believe there adaptive telephoto $$$) . i prefer shooting wide but if you need wide selection lenses or don't enjoy look wide angle look canon . drawbacks minor -- camera rather cumbersome -- would certainly tiresome handheld use it isn't designed shoulder-mounted use . i shoot almost exclusively indoors tripod so neither these issues relevant me . also irrelevant me reviews i've read which indicated lackluster battery performance -- again shooting indoors i always it plugged thus haven't noticed any battery problems . little menu joystick control button used toggle menu screens , well vcr playback options , frustrating when you're tired , but extremely trivial concern really . this camera expensive , even $1500+ prosumer class it tends more professional range , but i feel it great value considering what fine piece equipment it wealth features it offers . it much much more than enough camera consumer probably little more than i need actually--i've used mine few months i'm still learning how wring better better shooting it . once you've used it while it becomes clear why this particular model maintains devoted following . if i replace this camera -- provided i afford -- next camera would definitely panasonic probably its big hd brother hvx	1
description , it " well balanced highly portable : 4.4 pounds full operating condition " , not 10 pounds , which * shipping * weight . just wanted say . it lighter than xl	1
bought two ; both worked perfectly out box , no problems . easy load pictures , not very technical . exactly what we wanted family members . ideal relatives , baby pictures , etc . only problem pictures not necessarily show full screen , depending your original jpeg . would buy few more any day	1
this camera very nice . i actually bought it my g/f she loves it . when it first arrrived i got mess w/ it bit before giving it up her . i really enjoyed different settings take picutres . its great cause usually you get those shots way too bright because flash or too dark because no flash . this camera takes care both problems easy . i even enjoyed software it came w/ . only problem i when you upload pictures computer sure you push " safely remove hardware " button or you end up getting camera say there more pictures camera than there . this easy solve though . theres way you clear camera memory but im not sure i remember how . so problem more user error than product problems . great camera great price . it might not same prices since i got it electronics expo so it knocked down price but it worth original price . so theres my review . not depth but point . good enough	1
it not any usb connectivity . there no way hook this up your computer except through tv type hookups . other than it works great . you need software convert dvd something els able edit it your computer though ( edit movie make copies)i like it write direct dvd so if you don't want edit it , there no need bother computer . aware it only works certain types dvd . won't work dvd-rw . dvd-r only certain typre ram disk	1
i use this set my celestron 4se meade etx-90 no problems . optics seem pretty good quality ep construction good . just kit gave me instant increase versatility . it provides beginner intermediate astronomer number combinations eyepieces filters experiment . some good publications go long way toward learning sky . case compact very handy . it also room few extra items . well worth what i paid it then some	1
i very disappointed when aa batteries my digital camera came died within couple days . i've using this year half now , since i switched , i've never gotten so much low battery warning , even when i've taken couple hundred pics charges	1
this camera easy use great zoom . cheap considering all functions it . great product	1
i bought this my daughter , who 22 . she loves all great features clear pictures which it produces . she specifically enjoys range editing capabilities built into camera	1
works great , no fogging up , i put camara fridge before i use it , or if you come airconditioned environement no problems . if you get grease lens wash it liquid soap , else you water drops dont rinse they blur photo . my kids took hundereds fotos fishes .. never one before . now you film well i needed upgrade 1gb chip my 512mb . all programing functions without openening case .	1
i got one these my starblast 4.5 eq i amazed -- cassini division cloud bands saturn opened my view . highly recommended getting last bit " oomph " small telescope	1
this case nice , but i think expanding sides unnecessary . camera easily slide out out unzipping sides , except elastic strap usually pop up flash when you put camera , then same strap won't let go flash when you pull it out ... unless you unzip all zippers pull it apart . this still best case this camera though , long you don't want carry extra batteries , sd cards , etc .	1
i replace lost one this canon battery charger perfect one my camera power shot pro 1 . good product , high price	1
this charger great . no cord trip over or store . batterys charge quickly charger fits your pocket or camera case pocket no cord become tangled other accessories . great , great product	1
this great camcorder . picture excellent . it well thought out features . i like fact you also take high resolution still pictures . it very small compact . only thing could better flash still pictures . i often get glare flash picture	1
bought this camcorder(my 1st ) after reading most reviews net . quality great video other than low light rating but most consumer camcorder same problem anyway ) , didn't expect take still camcorder so didn't care 3.1 mp . very easy use feels good my hand . i gave 4 because i know soon there better camcorder market this price range	1
this digital picture frame very good lcd display . long you resize your digital photos match resolution 860x480 , pics . fill-up frame . one drawback your original pics . cropped . my 1 gb cf card display over thousand pics . color brigthness still good even if you view it 6 8 feet . if you want you change frame wood if you handy . overall i'm happy this coby dp102 .	1
i've this camera couple weeks now , it my 4th digital camera . i am very happy photos i'm able take , they truly outstanding . i'm still learning all settings but i'm finding everything user-friendly . i like way it feels my hand i'm pleased battery life . i purchased 2gb card replace one came camera it perfect size me . video amazing , i standing upstairs bathroom our 2 story house saw our little one jumping trampoline far end our backyard , so i decided tape it . not only quality good , camera picked up audio , which i never expected ! i like you zoom or out while you're taping , i wasn't able my last camera . i've no problems downloading pics or videos my computer prints i've gotten great well	1
i just got back my first trip using this camera , it performed excellently . two things i found very good : night shots high iso no flash outstanding . i took lot pics hong kong skyline , they just stunning . no blurry image crisp colors lines . there no need " no shake " , given these pics possible this high iso no tripod . battery endurance unbelievably long . i taking pics constantly all over hong kong two straight days , including lot night shots . battery lasted entire time . i bought second battery backup , but i rather doubt i am every going need it , this kind endurance . this best compact camera i ever owned	1
it amazing how much they squeeze into such small space . i owned one form elph or , past 7 or 8 years , they've always top quality . this version no exception . everything you'd expect one leading names digital cameras . screen big , menus onscreen information clear everything very intuitive . picture quality fantastic ! crisp hi res , many options size quality . detail some my shots simply astounding ! video capture some best i've seen none dedicated camera . 640x480 @ 60 fps mode , quite startling when you first see it . improved video capabilities one main reasons i upgraded . battery life seems very good . infact , i'd say it bit improvement over my last elph . i purchased extra battery , so i could charging one , while using other . i still haven't switched batteries yet :) overall , very please . this great , stylish , neat , full featured , camera	1
this ideal starter camera beginner . i found it easy use simple get started . however software comes this camera not so great . it runs slow my system features most people won't really ever use such greeting card maker . you're going want memory card this camera internal memory doesn't hold huge number pictures	1
standard proviso tech stuff always gets better cheaper , i highly recommend this new camera model low price . i only it two days , since nikon didn't warranty my broken lcd screen my l4 . please careful fragile nature these electronics ! i didn't drop it or abuse it , it apparently broke my pocket within padded case ! back l10 , most everything better than previous , low end , cameras , improved sound , what great me , voice recording capacity , outside 20 second voice memos attached particular photo . while digital voice recorders cheap pcs , i mac previously , only ipods accessories , or other costly recorders , create sound files then imported your computer then burned cds . just 512 mb card , you record hours . image quality bit bluish , some color cast hopefully corrected software . sharpness looks o.k. , price , it fine me . this makes great back-up camera , i use more expensive series camera . road , i can't afford missing great scenic shot , or hundreds those . l10 smaller slimmer than l4 . it carries well your pocket . it slightly simpler buttons controls . lens retraction quicker shut-off , zoom rather abrupt . other new , handy features characteristic planned obsolescence most tech items . goodies you wanting upgrade ! it remain seen how durable this camera turns out , but i high hopes . i intend more careful , never subject this beauty shock or any possibility drops . speaking tech support rep , you need nickel metal hydride batteries more than 2000 mah worth power , lieu what they recommend ( nikon-approved rechargables ) . some my ray-o-vacs aren't . i'm using only approved sd cards , but they now support up 4gb cards . that great if you trust card not fail -- why i buy several smaller capacities , therefore don't all my eggs one basket . you'll get enough memory , then 4 gb , probably then , few thousand photos storage . one major thing they work streaks still appear movie mode when faced bright reflections or sun . not bad earlier l , these don't appear final still images , but seen movies . you then remember not shoot movies outside evenly lit scenes . my older coolpix cameras didn't this problem . movie quality pretty good , but bit down my movies using my l5 . shooting movies train , bells horns much clearer sounding than earlier models . despite what ads say , i find no vr feature this model , nothing it manual . unless it enabled all time , which it seems not , you may wish wait till this excellent feature becomes standard all models . more serious photographers , vr included higher end , new l . also , i see nothing iso capability 800 , but i haven't yet tried night or low light scenes . one telephoto came out blurred , no blur warning , there . all all , this fantastic technology , all highly affordable price , although nikon isn't top rated brand it used , i'd get this first , around-the-home back-up , digital camera , if you haven't owned good one yet	1
i actualy bought this camera impulse . my friends going day trip so decided i should get camera . couldn't happier purchase . very pleased how picture turned out . took great moving still shots . i would recommend this camera everyone	1
just purchased this camera today replacement my previous kodak point shoot 4.0 so far , im pleased it , easy figure out how use my purposes e.g. simple photos , it working just fine . i really loved my other camera but my husband permanently " borrowed it " use work . i would recommend this camera people who want easy use device takes good , simple pictures .	1
this thing really surprised me price . you tell it cheaply made ( thin aluminum tubes cheap plastic latches ) but it cheap ! that whats great it . it really easy work . if you're going use it every day you might want something more sturdy , but amateur it sweet	1
this camera wonderful . novice i am , it perfect . basic mode very user friendly . lcd menus great . i purchased this model primarily due 12x optical zoom not disappointed . this model advanced modes i hope master my digital knowledge grows . if you're looking camera easy use excellent features , i highly recommend dmc-fz8	1
great battery , life without charging battery bigger than original , i bougth two my canon sd 600 they work perfectly	1
i ordered 2 these batteries my canon powershot sd600 . they arrived ontime . charged both my oem canon charger both worked right out box . just wanted some back up camera - spare batteries this price - you can't go wrong	1
good camera $129 i paid . everything pretty well , your picture modes pretty customizable . only qualm it takes second or two longer than i wish when camera saves/loads pictures memory card . might problem when trying shoot consecutive pictures -- but probably wouldn't doing it this type camera anyways .	1
this camera takes great , crisp photos . it easy use , great value . even close-up photos turn out great . you would think this camera more than 3.2 megapixels ! you get much larger memory card though , case most digital cameras	1
i found this light ideal my needs . it lightweight , compact powerful activated quickly when needed	1
i've wanted purchase pair binoculars couple years , but kept putting it off because i figured i'd dump least $300 quality pair . i wanted something compact , good quality , affordable . not exactly easy order . but after reading reviews these bins , i figured i'd give them try . all i say wow . these exactly what i looking . they provide very crisp image lower magnification levels . even 24x , although usually impractical , they lot fun . i find it easy focus change zoom level one hand which plus . general purpose viewing , these fantastic binoculars . bins shipped black velcro-flap carrying case belt loop back , small carrying strap you attach your bins	1
price , these binoculars provide unparallel carity easy focus . i like these binoculars so much i showed them couple co-workers right away . one them so impressed he ordered one his cousin birthday . great product , highly recommended	1
i bought couple binoculars past . always thinking higher magnification better . that not always true keeping object steady 10 higher your hands tough . higher mags also suck up light making image darker . now i eagleview zoom don't worry which model i should chosen . most part it stays 8 but when i really need get close zoom great . turn slide eyecups fine feature . love ' em	1
these lights came quickly great filming green screen shoot . case great too , because you wheel it around .	1
now , if i drop this camera , i , it keeps working . case safe keeps my camera safe small easy throw into my purse or pocket or strap throw over my shoulder .	1
i found this case just what i looking . it small enough fit my purse , but large enough hold camera , extra xcard , spare batteries . my camera protected we traveled overseas , but it easy pull it out any picture moments we encountered	1
well , i bought bino my 7 year old nephew introduce him birding . he loves it , infact he pronounced it " pretty cool " . good buy considering its compact what its supposed	1
actually , oil not prevent objective scratching slide , but instead allow slide viewed magnification all . high magnification refraction very high , lot light escape before it ever gets eye ( light going through glass , then air , then glass again , distorting its path greatly ) . oil used these microscopes same refractive index lens glass , so light travels through it same speed doesn't run off course	1
i am very pleased this camera . i photography 55 years i collection 12 cameras , last four these digital . i high end nikon cannon , but i think this best camera i ever owned	1
overall good lens , focus little soft 300mm . bokeh ok . canon dig reb xt auto focus sometimes oversearches . zoom control stiff . however , focal range great . this good walk around lens . i use it 100% now . 3.5 allows chance precious light short focal lengths . very good value money	1
item good fit what we need use it . would most likely rate it higher but we not used it enough so	1
i simply love this camera . i using over 1 year now no issues or problems . however , you must learn use functions properly optimum photo quality . auto setting great . many my photos look like professional portraits . everywhere i go people want check it out . wouldn't trade . i paid high price when it first came out . so today prices it well worth money	1
after springing cybershot august so i could compact camera i would actually take places , i've very , very pleased . last camera i older sony dsc quite bulky , ran batteries , shutter problems -- but it took great quality pictures interface features perfect , so i thought i would go dsct5 , since it avoids all those problems . only tiny battery charge , no sticky shutter ... it sexy hell . screen huge very bright . i hate taking pictures flash general , i find flash makes nasty redeye more often than not this camera . ( camera gives you impression you cant change shutter speed or anything ) however ! you easily change this going into over/under exposure options under exposing your photos when you dark environments . they come out surprisingly well blur-free	1
this light efficient . it fragile , so put lot emphasis not dropping it ! i like fact it uses same battery my sony vx1000	1
it just works ! it uses same batteries trv-900 , vx-2100 fx-1 or z1-ui only wish it horizontal	1
we purchased this camera using it couple months now . it great tool watching our 20 month old son his playroom during day if you leave room anything also night when he makes noise you aren't sure whether or not he really up awake needing you . pro con's: daytime - picture pretty clear but monitor small ; night vision - you tell if he standing up walking around crib but you can't see well enough see if he looks happy , sick or upset ; range - i use it throughout house but one end other picture sound quality suffer somewhat ; battery power - poor so i just keep it plugged into outlet ; mounting brackets - good ; interference wireless network - completely interfered rendered wireless network unusuable until brother-in-law reprogramed wireless network different frequency	1
my current camera olympus sp-320 . you read my review product page , if you wish . i like pictures i take , but i'm no pro there always someone whose pictures i admire more . i one friend who consistently takes great shots . when bunch us attended wedding last summer , there vibrancy her shots mine couldn't quite match . since she swore her canon power shot , i thought i'd give a570is chance . this weekend i both a570is sp-320 me weekend jaunt took half my pictures each camera , swapping back forth two . both cameras use two aa batteries . both optical viewfinders . both more modes than casual picture taker ever need . my hands , picture quality almost indistinguishable . some settings i prefer olympus ; others , canon , so a570si going returned since i'm well within return period . however , if i option returning olympus , too , i'd keep canon . here why : * canon slightly smaller . bulge olympus makes it harder find suitable case . * canon mode selector dial clicks firmly into place , unlike olympus which very loose . olympus dial often moves when camera removed its case . not so , canon . * canon 4x zoom compared olympus 3x . also , digital zoom better implemented canon . canon stops full optical zoom . if zoom slider released reengaged , digital zoom applied . this true even auto mode . olympus digital zoom not readily available every mode . when digital zoom available or turned , it lacks canon pause end optical zoom . pause . * a570is uses standard mini-b usb connector rather than what appears proprietary type olympus . none these -- or even all them together -- enough make me keep canon put olympus up ebay or half , but they'd enough get me pick canon if i didn't already own olympus	1
i used sd600 this blows it away . great taking pics moving car . worth every penny zoom shots ! fast action too	1
i really like this camera its so cute , only thing annoying when i download pictures my computer , which i often , camera its charger plugged then cameras usb cord plugged computer too course so i cord ( 3 ) going everywhere . i wish i able just sync camera into computer itself alone . but camera great very easy use . i really enjoy it . i would recommend this camera you .	1
this camera fast , small , lightweight . last year , we purchased s500 , so we knew what we getting . camera goes everywhere you go fit any pocket . i think picture quality incredible . camera simple operate downloads photos quickly using provided docking station . it isn't big do-everything high dollar camera , but money , it all features big camera small compact case	1
problem high power binoculars humans can't hold them steady , jitter makes it impossible really look something without tripod . image stabilization this pair solves problem holds things rock steady . this expensive product clearly distingues itself , one those products technology makes seem little magic . i only two small complaints : first , product this expensive they should pre-install neck strap you -- not big deal , but it would nice customer . second , i wish lens cap covers higher quality attachable unit so they wouldn't get lost . again , not big deal . these without doubt best binoculars i've ever used	1
this very good , fancy looking case my fujifilm camera nice sturdy body . looks awesome . only problem i see this camera it doesn't protect whole camera , which looks good but still makes me little bit worried when i put it bag other things . overall , good buy	1
i would recommend this case your panasonic camera . i took it trip europe recently it worked perfectly . i wore it my belt , which kept camera easily accessible without worry putting it down somewhere forgetting it . it fits protects perfectly , price right , it weighs almost nothing . i didn't give it full five stars only because i would preferred better quality leather - picky , picky ..	1
it nice little product works very well . it took me awhile get battery cover off though i'm guessing they used pneumatic drill factory put . i use it city , commensurate my job , though any type red light or walk light not helpful you seeing anything . but what you pay this little handy device isn't bad it works within restrictions tech	1
more than expected great price	1
i wanted good quality consumer grade digital camera take short trips , so i purchased this one . i think quality picures very good it most features i wanted . it few dollars more than i really wanted spend , but all all i am pleased . my main complaint battery life little short side , it takes while see photo you just took lcd screen . i really want something hold me two years , then these things twice good fraction cost . now it what i need it pretty well	1
after reading reviews here i little hesitant it high maintenance care , but you just need follow some simple directions it should give you plenty life . it amazing how functional camera case . every button feature used ( except infrared sensor , which must turned off ) even flash shines threw opaque cover sits case . loved case protecting my camera while skiing one best days my life , now i got pictures prove it . looking forward testing it out underwater .	1
first , this product rated 4 stars because there no cleaning cloth provided lens . i took 2 pictures glass door my house . 1 lens , 1 without lens . (...) this picture noway edited . well now u results , u think little easier whether buy , or not buy this product . pictures taken :d cr-trv33pictures compressed using : adobe photosho	1
accessory kit just what i wanted my new canon sd 630 . case fits perfectly extra battery real plus	1
again , i too try not duplicate efforts other reviews . i am not pro , but i am pretty advanced user , this least my 6th digital camera ( i used work industry so it easy get them ; i didn't whole bunch break me ) . i bought it because i wanted great camera hobby shooting but didn't want deal separate lenses . this not " first-digital-camera " ; it better suited people who pretty familiar digital cameras looking camera grown into . you choose " point-and-shoot " option or any several manual options . if you wish employ manual controls , camera take practice . there lot bells whistles , someone else mentioned , i would highly recommend reading instruction manual experimenting it before you take it big vacation ( bring manual too ) . image quality fantastic , even when you maxing out zoom . i take my pictures 8mp " fine " quality ; anything larger just overkill unless you're printing 20 " x30 " prints . nikon in-camera option creating compressed copy any picture you take ( e-mailing , etc . ) . i use macro feature lot , i took picture caterpillar plant even 4x6 print size , i could see hair folicles its feet . i also appreciate vibration reduction feature ( which you turn off ) flip-out lcd screen . before i purchased it , i looked canon 6mp digital rebel ( which felt too big my hands ) sony 8mp ( which , like most sony items , good quality but pricey ) . i ultimately decided nikon because it felt comfortable my hands , good reputation , high resolution flip-out screen . there lag time , there any digital camera . i don't notice it any better or worse than other digital cameras i've used . if you want no-lag , you need look d-70 or digital slr . battery life really very good , far digital cameras go , battery doesn't add much weight camera . if you going vacation or spend while getting your pictures " just right " before you take them , buy extra battery -- you won't regret it . i started using sandisk ultra ii 1gb cf card since not run out memory during outting . if you decide you want go 8800 , here some accessories you may want consider : spare battery ( en-el7)lens hood ( hn-cp14)nikon lens pen ( removes dust body lens) 1.0 gb cf cardlowepro rezo 140 aw camera bag which holds everything mentioned here room sparei my nikon over year now , i not experienced any lens error problems ( or otherwise ) so far . i'm sorry people trouble it because it really excellent camera i haven't once regretted purchasing mine . heartbeat , i would buy this camera again	1
this my first vibration reduction lens . i love it , now i hand-hold shots if i need . i haven't mine long so haven't used it lot yet , but images sharp contrasty . lens feels well built but isn't heavy . one downside slow minimum aperture , which means lens struggle focus low light or when pointing something shadow polarizer front . not let amazon sell you tiffen haze-1 uv filter go this lens , it causes focus errors unwanted reflections captured image . if you want protective filter this lens , you pay money get multicoated one	1
absolutely great daylight handheld photography . legendary nikon quality photographs easily obtained this lens . i use it mostly nature photography recently returned florida some excellent close up shots some birds . vr works very well hand held use . it big , heavy lens but worthy addition deserving nikon name . dav	1
advertised . would buy more . blinking light seals deal . i use real ones home but our office fakes good enough . people take notice	1
this met my needs completel	1
i received merchandise time promised excellent ( new ) condition . thank you .	1
after owning using camera month or so now , i am delighted it . i only replaced batteries one time , so don't know what review hullabuloo . small lightweight , many features . choice 6 meg , 5 , 4 , 3 , 2 , 1 meg photos fingertips . what i really decided this camera macro capability i take photos very small coins , must able get within inch or two . it preforms magnificantly . my previous camera add additional lens this which hassle . i love samsung digimax s600 .	1
this radar gun works hockey pucks too . i crouched behind net zapped oncoming slapshots . just remember wear protective gear when behind net , especially full face helmet . when shots miss net , pucks bounce off boards find you .	1
received tri-pod yesterday , purchased based positive reviews amazon , very disappointed . tri-pod 80% plastic . all controls plastic , how long this last debatable . weight should clue . lesson learned see it person first . would not buy again .	1
first all i'am satisfied amazon free shipping i got tripod after week wich before begining estimate date . tripod really nice good looking , it black metal controlers knobs very smooth also it gives you ability move your camera different angles . i got this tripod because one reason , which i failed take pictures night using night scene mode ( which best camera settings take pictures night ) without coming out blurry simply , this tripod job	1
i owe alot this little camera . i just bought nikon d80 i am keeping it because it never let me down . it got me job photographer it clear images high resolution my clients always stunned ( i architecture photography ) ... i now very succsessful freelance business i am professional photographer ! i can't say enough how much i appreciate opportunity this camera gave me . i love this camera !!! also i may add its trooper ... i used abused never it gotten wierd ... people look it always tell me " wow big camera it looks very professional ... i would laugh say nope its pro-sumer camera ... but its feels like pro ! [ ............ ]*** warning***this not camera portraits or action***but its great outdoors , nature , architecture , ect ..	1
i switched digital few years ago , my little olympus fine outdoor shots , but i missed my old pentax spotmatic , especially indoors without flash . i got this camera because recent lowered price . i am very pleased nikon it like my old camara back , but digital . it everything extremely well , learning operation simple . i especilly like mode . i worried steep discount price meant something wrong camera , but this doesn't seem case . comparing it similarly priced digitals , this great buy ! people seem going big telephotos , but wide angle lens very handy . i always wanted nikon ...	1
this wonderful camera . it simple use , fabulous zoom fantastic price . i'm so pleased it	1
this no brainer . works great soften up flash , both direct bounce application	1
very simple , yet very effective diffuser . gets rid harsh shadows flash unit gives without one . also softens light great coverage when used specified instructions	1
first off , this camera simple use , very convenient size ( size fat ipod ) . video quality pretty decent , i use it upload youtube myspace videos . i would recommend it just , if you're looking uploading videos internet . videos saved really easily ( usb port directly unit so handy ) edited/spliced microsoft movie maker . ( using this program also cuts mb size considerably ! )my only complaint so-called 30 minute recording capability . i 3 minute video my card it said i only 21 minutes left recording . after i filled card i noticed i not full 30 minutes , maybe 18-20 . oh , audio bit funky side , mainly because it tends give lisp any ' ch ' ' ' sounds . look this camera up youtube see examples	1
this lens sharp , works very smoothly beautiful color . it first rate lens . i only wish it just tad bit longer - 16-60mm - would equivalent 24-90mm . it it equivalent 24- 67.5 mm 35mm terms .	1
well like many you out there i got hdtv christmas . then came upconverting dvd player , hd dvr , ps3 ! most hdtv only 1 hdmi input . how i going make use all this new amazing picture quality when i only connect 1 hdmi input time . so google i went . i came across quite few hdmi switches . some really expensive but i not recognized brands . then i saw pureav belkin ( mac ipod user i definitely recognized belkin ) . so i bought it ... i mean i too what else you ? it 3 connection one out tv . works exactly like it should . remote everything . solid really small unit . lay packs cards side side you size this unit . but i am extremely happy unit . ( oh way it comes 1 hdmi cable we all know those little suckers expensive ! all my other ones philips 6ft hdmi cables walmart $32 .	1
very easy use camera takes solid pictures . this camera allows zooming sound while taking video . i like you option cliping pictures out video clips . this allows some humerous pictures . i really like this camera . i problem zoom button 2 months after buying camera after month not using camera . i press button really hard it zoom . i called amazon take back product but they not very helpful informing me how much money they would refund me or how i take it hp if it under warantee . all all , camera very usable i plan keeping it not any other problems camera	1
just gone back using film camera digital ( my wife still uses digital ) i found this excellant camera so far . i taken 6 rolls film everyone one came out perfect . i would recommend it	1
after researching several cameras this price range , i bought rebel t2 last month . it met my expectations perhaps then some . after recently trying out friends camera 150 . -ish range , i partially regret spending what i . it all comes down what you need , want , how many bells whistles you like . money though , compared competitors , i still think i made good purchase . after all , if i use it ten years , which i most likely , i surely got my moneys worth . bottom line : no complaints it	1
i enjoy birdwatching naturally i wish photograph birds i see when i . i used this lens fz7 trip maui . i saw i'iwi apapane , but those birds flit around too much me able get pic . however , i able get couple decent pix a'eo ( hawaiian stilt ) distance 300 ' so i pleased . i going port aransas see whooping cranes soon am very much looking forward using this lens then . note : although image stabilization these panasonic cameras excellent you absolutely still need tripod my opinion make best use this fine piece glass	1
this awesome buy ! it takes great pictures easy use . it wonderful features simply love compact size	1
i many great experience this camera . touch screen so easy use picture scan wonderful . i took this camera huntington library my pictures came out wonderful !! colors so true beautiful . i took closed up picture pink flower it came out so clear nice .	1
right out box i began using this great camera . great quality pictures very easy use . i am glad i purchased it	1
sony vad-wa conversion lens adapter lets other lens attchments polarizing effects filters used sony cybershot cameras . it works just fine however , when this adapter together lens attachments and/or filters , considerable portion picture , particularly bottom center , gets dark . reason this flaw ( just what other reviews mentioned ) flash just above adapter which causes dark shadow bottom center portion picture . everytime flash used , specially night or low light conditions , shadow cast which blocks bottom 5-20 percent picture . slave flash attachment may solve this problem but according it reviews , it reputation not firing off , gives too much light , expensive price tag . overall , i still give sony vad-wa conversion lens 4 star	1
what i say this adapter except it works my w5 perfectly . just screw it like lightbulb then attach whatever lens you bought it . easy , easy	1
i panasonic lumix fz50 digital camera , when i use wide angle extension my lens , i can't use intrnal flash ( lens casts shadow ) . so , i began shopping flash . i shocked when i saw prices panasonic flashes this camera ($300 $500 ) . after searching internet , i found sunpack 383 flash . i little nervous buying it . i worried it might not sync well or some defect since price so much lower . well , i received flash , slipped it onto my camera hot shoe , it works beautifully . no glitches results great . i particularily like 3 automatic settings -- maximum distance , intermediate distance maximum depth field . it also great bounce flash head pointed any direction . reference marks give exact angle bounce . i'm very happy this purchased thrilled i saved quite bit money .	1
i got camera amazon 3 months ago its amazing . features amazing .	1
alright , so i've reading some reviews people put here this camera , i just want offer up nice statement " if you gave this camera 3 stars or less , you're retard . " i'm pretty sure amazon won't allow me say it , but it true ! this camera so freakin ' great ! i own this one xl1s , this my " toy " camera . i'm just 24 year old kid , so maybe my opinion means nothing you . if so , then stop reading this . no one asked you , anyway . this camera sells itself . compare it some others same category ( make sure you're checking out gl2 not predecessor gl1 ) . $2999 asking price here way too high , though . shop around , you should able find new one $1750 or so . extended warranty covers cleanings once year . so worth money . i take her ( my camera ... her name " mandy " ) everywhere , i've already made enough short movies people her pay herself . she take beating , too . i took her 75 degrees 8,000 ft above sea level 23 degrees 12,000 ft less than 6 minutes time she didn't complain all . she definite plus our snowboarding trip ! tired reading all those specs may not make sense you right now ? this camera usable someone who never used camera ( which me before i made my purchase ) , adjustable everything completely manual . my only qualm " noise " low low light . should expected , though . i use xl1s ( " jessica " ) , but don't let stop you your purchase this . this camera incredible ! i seriously love it .	1
it seems if every time i want use camera , battery dead . i find if i charge it try use it next day , i should expect very much . i'm going purchase new battery see how goes , but i shouldn't so	1
so far , i like camera quality pictures . once you get used red eye flash going off numerous times before actually taking picture ( possibly losing moment ) it pretty neat . screen awsome ! so clear ! some scene settings require tripod shutter speeds lot slower thus result some shake . one thing i am really not happy macro feature . i love take close up shots insects , flowers even nail art etc , but this very annoying feature : camera focuses constantly ( out , out , out ) like it convulsion or something . you try grab best focus ( shot ) when it " doing its thing " 9/10 , pic blurred . i wish there way just shut off focus it manually . it pointless ability macro shot close 1.6 " if it out focus cause camera can't make it *^%#$% mind up what it doing ! i am going write nikon see if they off any suggestions this . maybe there some firmware downloaded fix it . i dunno . other than , i am very pleased my purchase would recommend it	1
i purchased this camera after getting junior mint stuck lense cover my cannon . cannon bigger bulkier , but came more bells whistles ( color select , super awesome macro , 6x optical zoom ) . while this camera doesn't all fun extras cannon , it small size , no extending lens knock while shooting or get rained ( or junior mints stuck ) menu easy enough navigate doing manual settings almost do-able novice . other words , there aren't so many extras clogging up menu choices you give up what you trying . while macro cannon better , macro nikon good enough general point shoot colors far more saturated depth . screen nikon also lot larger . cool feature battery . nikon uses li-ion batter which you never remove camera housing . charge camera you simply plug it into dock it comes w/ , or if traveling you bring just cable dock wall use it charge camera . while cannon nice , i'm happy cheaper smaller easier use camera	1
i looking case hold my nikon 5700 - nothing bulky , just something would offer some protection while dragging it around vacation . this case fits bill . it nice quality leather - holds camera snuggly . if i find something wasn't perfect this case , it would camera strap ( one same my 5700 ) doesn't fit nicely case i'd like it . it takes bit arranging , but it fit . this really such non-issue , but i wanted mention it . i keep my camera this case within my larger multi-camera bag home storage travelling airplane ( where my charger tipod kept ) . this small case great taking camera out day trips . such great price - i highly recommend this anyone	1
this case fits camera well , space extra battery several compact flash cards . not buy this case if you use filters . there no extra space large 67mm adapter or filters themselves	1
after reading reviews before i bought this camera , i skeptical because there some very negative feedback well mostly positive . this camera functions very well i am very pleased every aspect it performance -- especially price . rechargable batteries must !	1
i've it several weeks now it seems like great camera . i am still learning new features . i would highly recommend it	1
wonderful affordable housing take your camera places you normally can't! i took my canon s80 down 110 feet got wonderful photos ! my only advice scuba divers buy external strobe bracket . flash point-and-shoot camera not powerful enough give you colorful photos you really want	1
i've used camera snorkerling , protection down colorado river grand canyon last summer . it one those purchases i really feel gives me my money worth ; i would buy it again heartbeat . case very durable , fits neatly standard pelican case . unfortunately , camera wheel control cannot manipulated while inside case . this problem wheel control minimal , generally avoided little planning . wheel control only reason i don't give this case 5 stars	1
this optional charger benefit able charge batteries alpha more quickly than standard charger supplied alpha . it displays amount time left regular or full charge . although it charging bay two batteries , batteries only charged sequentially not simultaneously . one downside unit relatively large , much larger heavier than standard charger	1
camera bag excellent . this great deal getting extra battery you need backup your camera well constructed camera bag uv filter	1
you can't go wrong this bag , it extremely sturdy well-built . quality you expect canon , usual . if you just purchased canon digital slr or planning , i highly recommend getting this . if you kit lens , 58mm filter come handy course extra battery always good . i've already filled it my 4 lenses , notebook pen , rebel xt manual , my filters , two cf cards other accessories like remote trigger xt . i still room left . velcro/pad configuration system great because it doesn't lock you into always carry same set equipment arranged same way . tripod straps pleasant surprise	1
christmas , i received cannon g7 . very nice expensive camera . i not want trust it soft case . this case sturdy , but not hard . it comfortable carry around . easy slide camera out . i like strap camera what i wear around my neck rather than try fit it into case . it comes attachable mini case house battery and/or memory cards . i highly recommend this case	1
canon zr800 camcorder solid little unit plenty features most folks . great price , it surprising canon even included external microphone input ( after all , 90 percent video audio ) . actually , i bought zr800 " deck " play capture mini-dv tapes recorded my prosumer camcorder ( avoiding wear tear expensive cameras ) , but once i tried zr800 i loved it often use it day day use instead hauling around huge camcorders	1
very well made works well field when you taking shots quickly . i noticed better quality light falling my subjects no red eye . i not situation yet test shadow my subject falling further down but it goes reason if flash higher over lens shadow would effected	1
this why sony hot ! this sexy little ( yes its really small size pack cards ) it takes perfect clear crisp pictures battery life long 320mins perfect vacation , make sure get memory stick it though , because w/o it it only holds 15 pics . this my first digital camera i would definitely buy sony again	1
sony w55 followup successful popular w50 . it very good compact camera , easy carry easy use , reasonably priced - so most people happy it . not much changed w50 , which this case good thing ! one change w55 7 mp camera , rather than w50 6mp . honestly , that not big plus , they haven't made sensor catches light any larger . same ( good ) lenses , same size sensor = same ( good ) pictures , but not better . ( though it might help little features like smart zoom . ) obvious change course colors . don't make too much fun ! there 4 dsc-w series cameras our family , colors would kept my mother-in-law taking my sister camera home her . little personalization good thing . internal memory expanded ( 56mb ) , but i've never used internal memory cameras it , so i'm not sure matters much . it might worth knowing how use backup , dozen or two shots if your card full , or you some other problem . controls , menus interface w55 reasonably easy use . example , w55 easy access various scene modes ( twilight , etc ) , some explanation screen what those mysterious little icons mean ( so you might actually use them , since it tells you what they ! ) . if you're new digital photography , there learning curve . but if you've used other cameras much , especially sonys , you pick this up use many features right away . read short introductory guide comes camera , though ! rechargeable battery should easily last you full day shooting - hundreds shots - no problem . ( little wise turning it off when you're not using it ! ) so you probably don't need second battery , unless you're going into woods while . it nice not mess bulky aa rechargeables . also , lithium ion batteries don't memory effect , so don't worry partial recharging . just charge battery each night . so - before getting second battery , try it while see if you need it . but get case - something protect screen , least . fully closed one might help resist rain splashes little , too . you'll also want get memory stick pro duo card - pro cards faster , you need smaller duo size this camera . get 1-2gb card so you don't think running out memory too much - if you shop carefully , you find them so little these days it well worth avoiding running out memory . you might want spare card if you plan travel more than week , or use video mode often - which surprisingly good ( though bit dark ) if set fine , but uses enormous amounts storage setting . you stretch your memory , your hard drive space , using one lower-resolution settings take snapshots . you don't really need 7mp all your photos ! w55 take better photos than those credit-card type cameras tiny lens system - optics always make difference camera . any reasonable person very happy pictures w55 , given size it . camera little slow often take disappointing pictures low light dark situations . try high iso mode low light no-flash situations - picture quality suffers some , but most people find it useful . realistically , no ultra-compact camera work really well situation - if you need often , think something bigger lens bigger sensor . good light always gives best pictures any camera . there limits what you currently expect any ultracompact camera . w55 offers enough controls ( through scene modes program mode ) allow fair amount control over pictures , automatic camera . charger fairly compact rated 100-240v , so while you'll need plug adapter overseas you won't need voltage converter . battery charger little slow , though probably ok . keep this camera charged handy , you'll find you take lot pictures because it easy carry easy use	1
this large hood i doubt there'll any lens glare wide medium zoom positions this thing ! full zoom though , least my nikon coolpix 5700 , there not much hood shielding sides lens glare because lens so far out . i haven't any trouble this , it just observation i made . this hood all rubber except ring containing mounting threads , they're metal , so if you knock it against something likely it won't get damaged , ( hood or what ever it knocks against ) due soft rubber ; ' good idea nikon ' . interior hood ringes molded into it , reduce reflections , i'm sure . only downside thing looks like toilet plunger because its shape size you would not want it if you trying inconspicuous .	1
it worked stated however i dissapointed learn golf professional it cannot used official tournaments assistance slope prohibited !!! price competitive merchandise shipped promptly	1
i love my rangefinder ! i've it since oct . 2006 forgot it home only once . i've trusted my pinseeker over tee box yardage markers , myriad gps in-cart units , sprinker heads usual variety yardage center green course markers 200 , 150 , 100 . i believe what it tells me it highly accurate . i'm reluctant share yardage info my fellow players unless asked , avoid chatty debates responsibility their errant shots . ( you'd surprised ... ) few things aware , flags must clearly visable distant out focus shrub branches interfere laser sensor , low light overcast conditions difficult accurately measure distance lastly , if you've heavily consumed too much coffee or too many martinis night before , shakiness prevail . you may want add tripod your bag . %	1
i bought this rangefinder take myrtle beach golf outing . since we play different course every day , i hoped it would give me true yardages course i hadn't played before . it out performed my expectations . every golfer knows yardages course center green . but some greens 1 2 club lengths more . this rangefinder gave perfect yardages me . this rangefinder three modes operation . you use it hunting first mode , which just gives you yardage any target you aim . second mode pin seeker mode golf . you aim flag press button it gives you yardage flag . third mode pin seeker w/slope mode golf . you also aim flag it gives you distance pin plus or minus slope green(this mode illegal usga tournaments ) . it very helpful off tee . you could aim it fairway bunker or hazard tee you could get yardage would let you know whether you could carry it . i found it very easy operate great product .	1
camera fullfilled mostly all expectations . only anti blur system(super steady shot)was quite disapointing because most moving objects apears blury my other , oldest , olympus digital camera . i really expected more it	1
course this camera not digital slr . since i received it , i taken more pictures one month than i would my slr . i take it everywhere me because .... well because i now .... i loved my rebel but it too bulky vacations fun . i miss features it offered me , but this little guy catches lot more fun ..	1
waterproof case arrived perfect ( new ) condition overnight promised . i especially impressed because it coming me my vacation maui shipped holiday . thanks saving our vacation photos	1
i recently enjoyed two dives hawaii ... one during day one night . underwater case worked very well . i very pleased . i also use case any time i am around beach or near salt water sand order protect camera . if you get case wet , you rinse wipe off lense or you water spots your pictures . course this would true any case . only negatives flash little week since it somewhat obscured case . if you push on/off button too hard it may jam camera on/off button down . it only takes light push turn it off . overall it great product	1
i've camera over year , taken several thousand pictures it . it pretty darn good overall . i've pleased image quality , especially scenery shots . it fall somewhat short portraits people many cases , though . easy use . minor durability problems .	1
i bought this camera my wife christmas after i bought it she talking said she not like hp products . well she opened it christmas said it looked nice . after she took 40 pictures it i could not pry it out her hand crowbar .. it takes great pictures very easy work . she even let me take couple pictures it . so it shows you don't spend lot money get great camera . keep up great work hp ..	1
i've found these batteries last longer perform better than standard brand batteries . delivery great usual	1
product delivered prompt manner received perfect condition	1
i several digital cameras , many brands but i must say casio exilim ex-z600bk one best ultra digital cameras market . pros : fast operationbig , bright lcdgreat bodynice picturescons : no viewfinderno manual controlsadditional comments : lookrating : camera looks it online images . its nice dark , glossy black but doesn't smudge or keep finger prints easily . sizerating : 5/5its very tiny . you hide it clasping your hands . feelrating : 5/5its great feel . buttons small but not awkward . its light too . you hardly feel it yout pocket but its balanced comfortable hold . this camera practically perfect . this honest review . its great value money . i recommend it .	1
i don't think anybody going pretend little casio exilim ex-z600 6.0 mega pixel camera best camera ever built or takes best pictures world . but under $[ ... ] , it hard beat everything advertised . size perfect , one smallest , slimmest cameras made , easily fitting into one [ ... ] pocket , even when enclosed small case . viewing screen probably biggest brightest you'll find , so aiming shooting easy it . range modifications ( size , contrast , sharpness , saturation , etc . ) taking managing pictures seems almost endless , yet various menus camera offers simple navigate . camera docking stand makes downloading pictures one computer well charging up camera snap . moreover , according casio , single charge afford one up 500 or more snaps . picture quality ? it perhaps not absolutely clear well defined , even its maximum six mega pixels , best cameras ; although , fair , best cameras often cost three-to-four times much this one . so , far i'm concerned , i've no complaints , pictures i've taking delight eye . z600 makes picture-taking fun again	1
this must alpha . it fits so well looks great	1
this very easy use , well built housing . i've used it multiple dives 100 feet it met all my expectations . price , it cannot beat . if you dive you need add weight kit canon wwdc1 . without weights housing camera float . i added two plates ( one plate recommended canon ) my housing i find extra weight adds stability . i wish canon would include weight plates , but if you only snorkeling or using this pool weights probably not needed . i only two small gripes . first function selector dial awkward position i found i would often accidentally switch camera movie or playback mode when holding camera . i since learned check mode every time i bring camera my eye . my second gripe there no case camera housing . i'm using neoprene foam wrap i picked up camera store . i would not hesitate buy this housing or other canon housings again	1
one reasons my wife i bought canon this waterproof case . it works very well . it takes 5 minutes get all set up , i'd strongly suggest taking it dry run home before you it field ( except lubing up seal ; save real deal ) . our pictures came out very well camera safe whole time . couple things : first , getting rubber seal out its channel hassle , best two peole , one squeeze seal so it lifts up other pull it away . avoid using fingernails , since you might scratch it . second , it very easy accidentally knock lever back " underwater " mode setting " movie " mode setting . if camera starts shoot movie , that probably what happened . just flip it back keep shooting away	1
it insane spend $180 piece plastic , but it also insane spend $400 camera then need buy disposable cameras when you go scuba diving . this nice design , not too heavy , it job perfectly . i only wish it half price .	1
canon powershot very good camera exception red eye reduction not really work . i read instructions over over againg , but " red eyes " persist .	1
i am unable comment effectiveness product it given my daughter(an accomplished amateur photographer)as gift . i only attest fact product arrived time good condition exactly what my daughter requested her holiday gift wish list	1
while offered remote stylus digital camera , this remote match olympus e-500 digital slr camera . unit reliable , works perfectly e-series cameras , works expected	1
part fun taking group shots digital cameras dance setting timer running into shot . watching blinking light count down . this remote allows me fire off my olympus e500 either 2 or 10 second countdown within group . i actually purchased it make time exposures because it important not physically move cameras " bulb " mode . i not tried this yet , but i'll update review when i . i gave it 4 stars only because it very small unit may easily misplaced . amazon nice price this	1
we used this camera our honeymoon snorkling it great ! pictures little grainy , although i credit silt water more than camera quality since out water shots came out great too . lever front much easier use than push button strap perfect . we bought kodak hawaii when these used up picture quality significantly worse than fuji . we would definitely use these again	1
i am very happy resulting prints this camera . i've used other brands past never such bright colors focus shots . winding mechanism easy use . finally i pictures my diving expeditions remember . it even suited kids over ten use . mine lots fun their own quick snap	1
these anyone budget wants upgrade old pair travel binoculars or uncle fred 1954 hand-me-downs . they * waterproof * ( very important , it easy confuse these lower-quality nikon action range ) fogproof , clear bright images . very solid feel compact full-size porro-prism design . 7x35 version action extreme won highest position cornell ornithology lab 2005 binocular shootout out 15 budget entries - probably because 8x40 not tested . yes , they aren't perfect - higher price get you sharper optics , lighter weights , slightly better handling - but this price only alternative i could find leupold 6x30 yosemite around 25% less - model 6x magnification . i'm not sure why , but many sites don't cover warranty these . you get excellent support nikon usa - 25-year no-fault warranty $10 fix or replace fee original owner . combined low price build quality this could last pair binoculars you ever need buy .	1

i reservations buying this camera after reading few negative reviews citing excessive ' noise ' low light situations certain iso settings . knowing i would mostly using more simplified features majority time , given all generally positive reviews others , i decided give it try . i must say i am very satisfied camera . granted , i generally use normal or simple mode most shots , but used all modes several times since purchasing camera it takes wonderful shots , indoors out , low light bright sunshine . user manual very easy understand gives setting suggestions correct some these noise problems . i not any negative experiences it . i bought it replacement olympus stylus i damaged ski trip although camera great point shoot took nice pictures , this panasonic far better . combine compact size , sturdy build good looks you great camera . i bought leather lumex case amazon sold it bundle it very good quality leather snug fitting so not add bulk compact size . nice item .	1
i found these reviews customers wrote very helpful my pursuit buying digital camera . i looking something small , so i could bring it me wherever i went , something going easy use . i also love color options available becuase i like different . this camera very user friendly , weather you making your way through buttons yourself or reading manual , which actually very easy understand . i haven't used all options camera yet , i basically bought camera order take some snap photos my friends post items ebay . so far , everything success i would recommend this camera anyone who looking camera going user friendly , take great picture without expert	1
i'm very satisfied this product . picture quality could little better , but its features excellent . its dimensions perfect taking everywhere , it very easy use	1
camera works really well we've it now almost 2 years . my wife dropped it road cement floors few times accidentally but it still works ( although exterior banged up bit ) . one person indicated it really hard transfer video pc .. we no problems all using pinnacle studio transfers then copy dvd . ( thru doc station fire-wire	1
this camera fantastic . i also own $3500 sony mini-dv picture quality this camera virtually identical . transfer what you've shot dvd , or just play it right off tape onto your tv you blown away broadcast quality image . it very small , some great easy-to-use features shooting sun , shade , action , etc ., even extreme darkness . built lens cover also convenient . after owning this camera only 5 months though , i got error reported other sony mini-dv " dirty tape head . " well , tape head actually fine but damn message wouldn't go away no matter what i , so i it repaired . i bought it sears but wanted use sony repair after telling them truth i very disappointed , blah blah - $212.00 fix camera i just bought $450.00 not fair - they agreed take camera fix it no charge . ( point sony making effort , i believe , satisfy their customers . ) nonetheless , because problem i , i feel compelled recommend person purchasing this camera go ahead buy sony warranty - directly through sony before 90 day manufacturers warranty up . ( it only $117 3 years you'll piece mind . ) should you buy warranty ? no . things break ? yes . hell , i've plenty stuff break just became useless . point , this camera really awesome worth owning . you charge it without using dock however dock cool transfering your computer or any other source . battery comes it lasts really long too . this camera also analog capabilities which handy transferring old vhs tapes mini-dv	1
i purchased this camera just few weeks ago . i really love sony brand . just few comments though . price servicing standard fee . no matter what you send thats price . it digital camera or your camcorder . these devices opened clean room . these rooms filtered tiny particles like dust or your skin cells not get inside . operators wear those white suits keep all contamination them selves . this not slappys tv vcr repair we dealing . any foreigh material getting inside or your ccd dammage camera you don't want . keep mind these rooms cost millions dollars build maintain . if you worried then get warranty . any company charges around same price . check other companies . kodak charges much just open camera up . if you experiencing problems any electronic device out box return it or swap it out . they cannot test every single unit . usually they test several out batch . so if your unit not operating your expectations then all means its your money go take care it ! aside , i'm glad my powermac came firewire cable i needed camera . several years it just drawer . manuel not explain fully it required transfer video tape using this . ( least mac users ) . taking video easy transfering it mac simple . camera comes video editing software but i just used imovie idvd make my dvd vcd . since i already toast mac it easy burn movies disc . otherwise stick software included . those pining not memory card included you not missing much . quality pictures movies you take card not noteworthy . you need plenty light , photos very grainy photo mode memory stick not high megapixel rating , videos chopy . so other than just taking small images possibly keep reference this feature useless . camera video out port camera itself so you leave docking station computer when wanting connect tv just use av cable alone camera . i not hear any motor noises recorded tape . though it make some noises when turning unit . menu system fairly easy navigate easy button makes it " easy " anyone pick up camera shoot . remember you not getting professional camera this consumer use not all features functionality $ 2,000 -$ 3,000 model .	1
i compared several digital photo frames before deciding this one . i managed get one these off website $110 , it best among three i . i digital spectrum 5 " photo frame which could play music video all but looks like toy resolution poor limited viewing angles . second one i radio shack - optimus - it 7 " but photo display same 5 " 7 " horizontal not diagonal . ( it like widescreen format but when you display normal picture , it would only display black bars side . optimus fantastic resolution viewing angles but it not accept cf cards not play videos . finally , i settled royal 8 " . price - i think it best terms value function among three . pros royal pf80 : ( 1 ) accepts cf , sd , mmc , ms ; ( 2 ) plays avi video ( minus sound ) , ( 3 ) fantastic resolution viewing angles ; ( 4 ) 8 " diagonal screen big enough seen across room ; ( 5 ) comes remote ; ( 6 ) removable silver frame but there not extra bezel boxthe cons : ( 1 ) no speakers no sound output ; ( 2 ) ac wire little short ; ( 3 ) setup not fully plug play . you need select few buttons before it would play , ( 4 ) build still plastic but least it painted like photoframe thus , not look like toy . quality comparable westinghouse 8 " sold bestbuy but half price !	1

this product rugged forgiving . accurate +/- 1 ft ., this absolute must all serious bowhunters . lightweight easy use , i find only one minor design flaw . it designed right-handed use slightly cumbersome those who choose use it left-handed hunters ( i am ) . even this minor design flaw , i still am very satisfied this unit would not hesitate recommend it others . most encounters under 50 yards ease use accuracy critical elements hunt . i harvested nice elk this year 52 yards using this unit . thanks bushnell	1
i don't like pink so i bought blue bag . i bought black one , but it so skimpy i returned it prayed until this one arrived . i no trouble amazon crediting me return , either . it so cute ! i'm too old " cute , " but i kept it because i needed case my new hp r717 . it small , yet padded enough trust your camera cushioned if you drop it . i dropped my camera it not injured . it little pouch inside store extra battery my camera , not big aa batteries , but flat type come my r717 . i recommend this little bag , or pink one , even if you don't like pink ... or blue . they well cushioned snug , but not too snug you think they tear . sturdy nice shoulder straps magnet closures	1
i bought c-533 version printer dock 3 , i love this outfit ! small , lightweight , takes great pictures ! my only two complaints , number one ; cartridge/paper kits hard come locally , when i find them , they outragiously high price . number two ; i run older windows 98 computer , software windows 98 not incuded . i download it , after download , it complicated set up , contact tech support find name hidden driver file so i could locate it install it . i realize windows 98 becoming system past , but there many these systems still out there .	1
very easy use . got it my mom christmas . she love it	1
this far one greatest gifts ever received greatly enjoye	1
camera defintely worth amount they charging it . my daughter just loves it . she always taking pictures , all time .	1
i bought this battery back up one came my camera i am pleasantly surprised how long it stays charged . i use my camera almost everyday i've only change it twice . i highly recommend it	1
if you go remote places , you need least one extra battery your camera . this price ( used ) , i'd even buy three . even though this rechargable lasts longer than aa batteries , you lose lot battery charge when transferring images source ( computer ) or viewing them lcd . you might figure 125-150 picutres one battery , but video use even more	1
outing park my nieces , i shot 5 rolls film . i used several different film types : kodak gold 200 , fuji superia x-tra 400 , fuji superia x-tra 800 , fuji color slide film . far , best pictures fuji 400 speed film . bam !! colors just jump out grab you . great skin tones . grains this film superb when enlarged 8x10 . i am looking forward trying fuji 100 200 speed films	1
this camera i use it works great ! i surprised how well it records video too ! it very easy adjust camera environment you photographings . zoom excellent doesn't seem drain batteries much . i would recommend this camera amateur or professional .	1
this only camera you ever need ! i mine 1.5 years not only pictures great but i use 2gb memory card video quality amazing !!! i take video , load unto my computer dvd family watch less than hour ( if you can't wait just plug cord hookup your tv watch video straight camera ) . i retired my digital sony handycam ( which great video camera ) . i used this camera extensively 1.5 years traveling china , europe us - no problems - friends family amazed quality pictures	1
i've this product over month used it extensively during my vacation business trips . dslr novice , i enlisted advice two my very experienced friends . although canon nikon lines bit standard , i think pentax k100d where money . it stacks up both nikon d40/50 canon d3 quite nicely terms picture quality . it nicer grip feel , my opinion , nikon d40 image shake reduction godsend during those critical low-light , no-flash picture taking opportunities ! i would highly recommend this camera any novice who not already own set lenses either other two manufacturers . great camera great features killer price .	1
this camera performing flawlessly provides much higher quality results than kodak p850 it replaced . built-in anti-shake must feature , which limits dslr field dramatically . i see no reason buy expensive anti-shake lenses such nikon canon want you get . camera anti-shake 99% users superior solution . i concerned battery life aa solution , but using sanyo eneloop rechargeables worked out great . these batteries don't high self-discharge rate which normally associated nimh batteries , so you leave camera sitting few weeks still ready go	1

prior review decrying aiptek/macintosh incompatibility flat wrong . mplayer plays aiptek asf ( mpeg4 ) files perfectly . i suspect there other programs would job well , but haven't researched it . mplayer free , took me all 10 minutes find install . download happy . fwiw , today i bought similar aiptek pvr ( no optical zoom , half price sale major chain ) . i intend use it skiing , where i don't want risk more expensive camcorder or deal additional weight bulk . purchasing aiptek , i expecting very basic vcr quality , that what my camera delivers small inexpensive package . build quality seems entirely adequate this class product . user interface very easy pick up . my view , this useful versatile device . especially when paired mac . :o	1
i recently purchased rebel t2 camera body only after my canon eos rebel 2000 gave its " last gasp " . i canon user since 1979 ae-1 ( i still ) . i liked fact t2 body plugged immediately into two ef lenses i owned ( 28-80mm 75-300mm ) , which protected my previous investments . i taking pictures within seconds opening package loading batteries . although i my sights set digital rebel some point soon , you just can't beat quality traditional 35-mm film photoprocessing . upgrade over eos rebel 2000 , lcd located camera back easier read . also , t2 seems more " solid " me , but lighter weight . i took older eos rebel 2000 me couple 75-mile backpacks ( which probably led its early demise ) , so i now new-found respect lighter design . final note , i also appreciated ease ordering via amazon.com . there plenty web sites offering same canon t2 camera back , including those which would saved me few dollars . but none long-standing relationship i amazon over past several years	1
i looked digital cameras months - literally - before i just decided lug around 35 mm slr . everyone probably already knows , megapixels matter whole lot when you're talking blowing picture up larger size . what great film unless picture taken out focus , or bad light , you use negative blow something up quality really doesn't start go down until you're making huge prints . ( how huge exactly i don't know , but biggest i've blown up around 4x4 feet , still no trouble . ) prints i've gotten out this camera so far stellar . ( i use fuji film -- i think it better than kodak , even though kodak better commercials . give it try ! )the camera itself not too heavy , granted , it not convenience tiny digital camera , but it not bad i'd expected carry it around all day . neck strap nice , manual actually easy comprehend . i like camera buttons lot it features body -- it seems complicated first , but once you know how use features , they're much easier access than they would if you scrolling through menu . t2 seems worth hundred or so more dollars than you would pay very similar rebel k2 canon . one thing - make sure you take batteries out if you're not going using it week or more . it seems like they go dead if they're camera , even if it off	1
i love this camera . it handy , goes my purse everywhere . sure it isn't canon rebel or remotely like it , but it fast fast fast , holds charge , takes great wide angle shot takes superb macros . i don't use movie feature but it it . there lot offer this little camera . i people stop me all time ask what brand it . buy it happy :	1
this my fifth digital camera , i like it best far . it also cheapest . it my first wide-angle my first silver-not-black : someone else said , i don't see how i would ever go back non-wide-angle after this ; but i wish mine black . i noticed colors faded fluorescent light , but macro it excellent -- much better than more expensive camera i already bought macro purposes ( canon . ) i also love battery , which seems last forever . i bought replacement lenmar battery which also great , cheap , but it got some bad reviews because it described wrong model camera , not fx-01 . ( if you read customer reviews , you figure out which one right one you . ) i problems understanding display , which shows options don't correspond any place camera you select options . ( i guess i should look manual . ) also , i don't like software decided not download it all . i bought this because i wanted camera made computer company much camera company , , i wanted it work . also , someone sent me email history leica , how they saved lot jews concentration camps . other nice thing this camera i use it lot more because i carry it me every day : it tiny battery always works , so why not ? graininess , my desktop pics look fine , i would not raving this camera if it not very easy take good pics -- but i admit i haven't used it printed pics so far	1
it works advertised . it ( me anyway ) only charge kodak battery pack ! i shoved some nice high end lithions it would not charge them . oddly camera dock my old dx4900 charge almost anything	1
my friends similar products they paid up 3x more . quality very good ... easy use ... such great gift almost any occasion	1
i purchased this camera my 5 year old grandson . it small enough handle large enough hold steady during exposer . general operation this camera very simple easy use . image doesn't stay window very long after exposure made , but it easy preview later	1
pro's:no recording media change , long record time . small lightweight . con's:for price , i can't think any . i think some people seem forget this model considered budget hd camcorder . you not going get " brodcast quality " video out it . you not going get good low light performance . what you get affordable , compact , decent hd camcorder shoe-string budget . nothing more . you paying convenience not change tapes or dvds , bottom line . i've mine now 9 hours so far i've only test shooting it low-light conditions . auto results less than exceptable . if you take little time learn manual controls then you get satisfactory results . there some " noise " ( grainy picture ) but again , this " bottom barrel " camcorder . i've read many reviews this device ( other everio models around this price range ) people all complain poor picture quality i just want say last time ... it budget hd camcorder . yes , i know i'm repeating myself but i want put this issue bed . if you want really nice picture quality , pick up one sony new hi-def hd camcorders . mmmmmm ... might set you back $1200 . people complained mod file . idiots . thats all i got say . included software converts it mpeg2 you . duh !?! no time i my ' test video ' shot , downloaded , converted , edited using windows movie maker . please keeep mind this first camcorder i've ever bought . this first time i've edited video my computer ! also , format hard drive before you begin record . some people complained picture quality worse than web cam . through my countless hours searching " truth " , i came conclusion this may why . they don't even mention until page 39 manual . one most frustating things i've my life research read reviews camcorders . geez , what worm . i'm trying make this blunt possible next guy who reads this shopping camcorder so he doesn't get stuck internet every night week half trying find out truth this thing . " don't listen complainers . they didn't know what they doing " . it budget hd camcorder ! so far i'm very pleased this product quality thus far more than exceptable my needs . record i'm lighting technician/designer audio/visual company some knowledge video technology , but limited hands-on camera experience	1
this camcorder great ! it small , very light . it easy use . only thing i don't like extended battery sticks out back camera so far . even battery it came looks too big .	1
i sony hd camera professional work it here there but i would not able it wihout wide angel lens . there so much 30 mm lens this lens explands possibilities 100fold . next time though , i'll buy high grade lens . this thing not going last much	1

i've this camcorder week now i think it works great .. except touch screen feature . takes little getting used .. especially when accessing special features ( such fader effects ) while filming . digital still quality poor when recording directly memory stick .. but same images taken still prerecorded tape much clearer . all all it good product .. just takes some getting used	1
pros : compact , lightweight , portability , easy use , big screen , good reproductioncons : microphone sensitive wind , getting used not viewfinder , bad low light performance . summary : i picked this camera upgrade my old canon zr10 . first reason i chose it small size portability . good light conditions , this little beast its best shots , but low light conditions this camera disapointed me ( specially compared mi old zr10 ) . please don't buy it if you plans use it stills shots because it low resolution . included handycam station all ports ( firewire , usb , power , video ) you need conect it . big touch screen must , because screen only way access camera controls ( besides some them edge screen ) . you camera more characteristics better image quality same price , but if your concern size portability this your best choice world mini dv format	1
i am advanced amateur photographer . love this camera results it offer price . very impressed results . brought nikons , returned it . 4 nimh rechargable batteries , it run weeks takes good amount time get drained . i dont use lcd review my pictures till i complete shoot day . normally i shoot canon 10d dslr . i carry canon a620 all time emergency situations . love self-timer , other manual options , colors mode .. etc . its really playful camera truly great results . i always shoot iso-50 keep image noise low . so , i recommend same . video shoot output ok . you cannot zoom while shooting video though . this camera really tough my kid dumped it several times ground i not seen any problem	1

this best camera i've ever saw my daughter loves it .	1
purchased this unit new $160 . good performance - little practice , getting readings well over 800 yards , even bright sunlight . also like fact it uses standard aaa cells . housing design leaves bit desired - it bulky , battery cover not very secure . see losing cover easily . not ergonomic more recent models . overall , $160 rangefinder genuine 800 yard performance , good deal	1

i bought this camera take me disney world . i digital slr but didn't want use it this trip it little heavy carrying all day - just wanted small camera which would go my pocket . i am certainly not disappointed my purchase - i took over 400 photos only deleted 20 them . majority pictures sharp excellent color . i used optical zoom quite lot - this worked really well . i disabled digital zoom . all pictures taken highest quality so i could edit later if necessary . i took lot night shots firework displays - some pics weren't so great - but others very good . i would certainly recommend this anyone wanting convenient , easy use camera . menu easy navigate i found batteries lasted long time . it nice able buy regular aa batteries use emergency . i spent lot time evenings scrolling through all my pictures , so batteries really put test ! i like viewfinder this camera not one - but it really wasn't problem even shots i took when i couldn't really compose image worked well	1
we'd ordered different one taking forever ship so we ordered this one instead . we love it !!! it takes great pictures !!! easy use !!! my favorite part when buying ink paper , you get enough both know exactly how many pictures you print out	1

i just bought this camera before making trip disney i absolutely love it . my pictures just beautiful . they very clear very sharp . this really nice camera anyone	1
because low price these batteries , i expecting some them may duds . however , i am pleased all them seem work . i these batteries month , so i cannot comment their long term reliability . also , i not tested whether they really 2650mah or not . i used them mainly my mp3 player portable speakers some battery operated foot warmers they worked well . one thing though , ' shoulder ' battery positive end seems very slightly highers or ' nib ' little bit shorter than most batteries . this means these batteries may not make good connection 100% electronics . i this problem only cheap portable radio able solve it sticking little bit aluminum foil battery contact . most electronics not this issue	1
i am accustomed using larger point shoot zoom . this sleek pocket sized point shoot gives exceptionally sharp pictures . it focuses very swiftly i would suppose due leica lense . battery life good . i notice photos tend calibrate little blue range . i like little more zoom . overall , i like it very much	1
i rebel xt lenses , flashes , etc . my wife wanted small easy use camera so i got her this her birthday . she got it last night up all night taking pictures around house experimenting wide range options available . first she thought camera too complicated but after staying up all night using it , she living it . professional photographer , this camera great i may steal it events quick way take some pictures . it all features super resolution make great companion ( long she lets me take it ) highly recommended anyon	1
this replaces my 2.1 mp digital elph i use when i don't want carry my big slr ( digital rebel xt series lens ) . positive : instant start-up , menu navigation zoomscreen quality comparable video ipodcomfortable intuitive button placementstrong flash ( camera size)modern/traditional camera aesthetics ( great looking)acceptable battery lifecamera operation obviously well thought outlow price what you getnegative : poor low-light shooting without flashlots noise iso more than 200no image stabilizationzoom ring spring little too strongplastic battery doorthis perfect pocket camera if you care more ease-of-use , aesthetics , size , price than trying capture print-worthy photo . overall i'm very pleased this camera , but only because i slr capture important moments/places . think great myspace photos rather than great family christmas cards .	1
pro photographer here . using so many different digital cameras .. because i am very picky . this camera fantastic . great looking sexy design . simple easy use . fantastic looking pictures .. fast easy small size fits your pockets . great micro function . great movie mode . sharp accurate color pictures .. best compact digital camera market . well always new things coming out surprise me but least now/so far this best one market right now- point shoot/compact camera catagory . canon makes great camera ..	1
i similar issue reviewer ... my z740 lcd screen failed few months ago . i turn camera all screen shows solid white . little eye-piece viewfinder still displays fine , pictures videos still come out fine , but i can't use lcd screen my viewfinder any more ... which one biggest reasons i bought camera ... others online this problem , but i can't find anyone who gotten it resolved . my camera well out warranty , so i no hope kodak fixing it . otherwise though , it great camera ... very impressive actually . i just wish it hadn't died after year half occasional use ... : -	1
i bought this camera last summer . i taken enough pictures put up review now . i love this camera ! pure simple , it met exceeded my expectations . pictures it takes very nice , sharp , focused , crisp . it so many features you play around . i probably only used half them more than once . it very nice lcd display , or you take pictures through traditional peep hole . view screen it always tell you , which mode you , gives you nice centering square , what picture you , etc . zoom it awesome , although i haven't used much date . you take close up shots flowers , insects , etc ., it still get everything just right . three my favorite features though : option take video clips , fact you shoot photographs black white or sepia color , which gives your pictures real antique or historical feel depending what you going . it even let play around shooting night picturs , or different landscapes near far . when you print out pictures off your computer , if you any kind decent printer you almost shocked how detailed crisp picture . i would almost swear it better than film pictures . i couldn't stop looking it , because i so amazed ! person like me mainly takes normal snapshots most time , i don't know what else i could ask camera ! moreover , you can't go wrong price . it little more expensive than other cameras ? sure ! however , features it it well worth it . it isn't exorbinent begin . way , you people like shop around best price like me , i went 3-4 different stores my area cameras like this one , best price i found here amazon . if you buy it , you love it , end story .	1
good product but not suitable medium format cameras slr cameras large telephoto lenses	1
i went camera store look tripods . i noticed this one , it went very high which main trait i looking . it felt strong , not flimsy like many other tripods display . panning smooth you flip head its side vertical pictures . it seemed like perfect tripod except price ... $80 . i checked it out amazon find it only mere 40 something . i havn't used it yet , but i know i'll very happy it .	1
money you cant beat it . it not pro lense . it doesnt pro lense price . first you need learn what your doing . f/4- 5.6 isn't low light lens . you need use flash . outdoors it fine . its lense not photographer . if you dont know how use it , it can't teach you . if you , you'll love it	1
i wanted get decent start digital slr , but hobby camera , i can't justify spending $1000 one lens . this zoom lens gives me sharp results good light , passable but grainy results low light . if you learn strong weak points this lens use it accordingly , you won't disappointed . if you aren't willing learn work your lens , you probably won't happy high-dollar ones , either . ;) this makes good partner 18-55mm kit lens d-50 . if you're up spending extra money , skip other lenses get 18-200mm nikkor $1000 . good choice this category 70-300mm nikkor , also available amazon	1
if u like me likes take pictures places visited like capture atmosphere place this lens . pictures not perfect but they good enough	1
i love this camera . i bought it my trip paris . i found it very easy use . one feature i didn't realize it video sound . i found very useful . i bought 2gb memory card go camera . one it comes doesn't hold many pictures . software easy install use . not really small enough pocket but still great camera budget	1
this my 3rd digital camera i bought this one supplement my larger 10x zoom camera . this one fits nicely into pocket or small camera bag easily take it all events or travel . i've found it takes nice photos indoors when flash used .... even when cats or dogs i'm shooting moving around . i've felt life battery set pretty good , but i've using nice rechargeable ones . definitely get set 4 , then you 2 use 2 backup set . settings pretty easy figure out change 99% my photos taken " auto " setting came out pretty good . others indicated , indoors - without flash - produce blurry photos , but that nature almost all cameras , not unique this model . glad i bought it would highly recommend it	1
this camera takes great , crisp photos . it easy use , great value . even close-up photos turn out great . you would think this camera more than 3.2 megapixels ! you get much larger memory card though , case most digital cameras	1
great design firm body protects camera against bumps knocks . i saw only two problems : first , carrying strap too soft gets wrapped up itself . second , case not permit installation tube uv filter camera . it simply isn't deep enough . you need both these items order protect lens . it would simple redesign fix issue .	1
i bought this case my cybershot dsc-w1 . camera fits beautifully into case . i especially like shoulder / neck strap detachable . one thing indistinguishable photo : there two zippers run up each side case . they connected smaller strap ( seen photo - much like wrist strap ) you pull zip or unzip both sides once . side zippers not run top or bottom case , so there less danger your camera accidently falling out when you removing case . color case less blue-siver , shown pic . it more taupe-silver , but it looks quite fly brushed metal plate front . please note mini-pouch not fit inside camera case . however , it velco flap which allows it attach securely shoulder / neck strap . i attached mine smaller wrist strap , but probably end up storing it my purse . i easilly fit pair replacement batteries their plastic case , two memory cards into mini-pouch . i would given five stars if mini-pouch fit inside camera case - thus my 4.5 star rating	1
really nice camera bag compact digital cameras . this bag hold most accessories compact digital camera owner want carry either used shoulder strap or belt loop	1

if you looking good small camera , no intentions ansel adams , this good camera choice . i travel alot , this camera perfect because it fit my pockets or small purse . it also takes pretty good pictures	1
i love this camera . it handy , goes my purse everywhere . sure it isn't canon rebel or remotely like it , but it fast fast fast , holds charge , takes great wide angle shot takes superb macros . i don't use movie feature but it it . there lot offer this little camera . i people stop me all time ask what brand it . buy it happy :	1
good product but color not so attracticed	1
i got this camera month ago my birthday . when i opened it up i astounded . camera tiny extremely thin , yet it giant bright screen back . i'm artist i like my camera all times , making this one perfect since it fits my pocket many other things . there many pros few cons . first off other reviews people said flash week sound playback quiet . these both completely false , both outstanding what i seen other cameras . feature wise it decent . it lot good themes taking pictures certain things , its extremely comprehensive . changing simple settings like flash on/off macro mode extremely good easily visible screen . one quible i would lack extra specific adjustments getting picture just right . if your not big time photographer features far enough . now picture quality etc . first off this camera rediculous number pixels its size . this both good bad . lots pixels means lots detail , right lighting this camera get some very crisp shots . however low lighting pictures blurry if you blow up pictures big enough you see little bloches color . most part this no problem especially if you proficient photoshop . video recording excellent quality completely replace your video camera ( aside zoom ) . which reminds me , zoom isn't great , but there so much detail photo you just crop it down it looks just good . conclusion this camera accomplishes all following- wow your friends , fits anywhere , easy use , takes good big pictures , takes great video , generaly great dea	1
camera one best considering price size it . only problem i found it not light , so you need buy external one , if not all shots you night very dark	1
i totally love this camera . very easy use beautiful pictures . perfect scrapbook give away grandparent pictures	1
main reasons i bought this ( now discontinued ) model : it 3 ccd chips ( great color detail , especially outdoors ) , it size feel , fact it accessory shoe mic input . i use it family videos , short videos our church youth group . clarity great , sound good such small camcorder . backlight compensation feature works great ! battery life average industry , i recommend buying bigger energizer brand battery . only gripes i : it doesn't true night-vision like sony handycam , you can't shoot true widescreen ( though there " widescreen mode " , but it loses resolution . bottom line : best features lowest price i could find market . too bad panasonic discontinued this model , replaced it 1 ccd model without mic input !	1
it great , light little camera . very handy field work . i'm very pleased it . it take still photos . i find usb 2.0 video transfer very useful : saves me trouble buying installing firewire card . it not get full 5 stars because , unlike many , if not all , previus models same line , it not include hand remote control . too bad , because it woould mayor bonus . friend mine gs65 model , which less megapixels ' such , but include remote . heck , my manual talks remote everything , kinda throws it your face bit . oh well , it still very good camera price , i mean , 3 ccds , that just too cool	1
indie filmmaker here , always looking out better camera ! sony hdv series astonishing technologydon't let people tell you footage " too compressed " ---- technically , it , but once it gets screen , it looks stunning ! i haven't much filming this camera ---- but i seen its footage edited its footageboth television computer monitor , i impressed its ' look ' ---- very detailed extremely clearediting breeeeeze this footage ! i edited final cut pro could composite 5 layers all above each other , each different opacity , fcp real time engine kept up without render ! thus , compressed footage makes editing easy - but sony managed make beautiful picture out this stuff toofor indie filmmakers out there ---- test one out before purchasing ..... i find sony hdv most clear look out there --- emulating beautifully shot nfl game hd ..... but cinematic looks , i still may stick panasonic dvx100 , there more cinema feel onehope helpshappy buying !!!	1
addendum 3/30 : correct guy correcting me 2 reviews above . regular mini-dv mode widescreen , there definitely wider picture . focus one item switch modes , you see picture get wider . hd mode anamorphic 4:3 - stretched fit 16x9 , but keeps aspect ratio so everything doesn't look stretched . i've run tests know what i am saying . you ? recently shot my uncle wedding widescreen , played video back his widescreen tv . aspect ratio image accurate not stretched . yes , this shoots widescreen , but not hi-def same time . original review : my first " prosumer " camcorder i ever owned i love it . color reproduction phenomenal great features . few caveats may scare away people looking something more , but this more very high end consumer item . not novice , but someone more shooting talent than average person . if you want true hd professional camera , spend 15+ grand stop knocking this one . bother me regular mini-dv record true 16:9 mode . while hd mode anamorphic 4:3 . ( stretched fit 16:9 ) wide-angle lens fix $500 more . but if you transferring regular dvd , you still shoot mini dv widescreen because dvd doesn't record hd . so , unless you transferring hd dvd , like blu-ray , you best consumer/prosumer widescreen camcorder available . rated 3lux , low light doesn't harm this baby much . i find accessories pricey too , but cost you pay when you go prosumer . everything else beginners amateurs . tip : get long life battery . sony 970 recommended longest life , but 960 served me well days shooting/standby plenty time left over . get light too ! i mention women love men big camcorders ? {: -pnp-970 battery : http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/b0006g3bhw/ref=cm_aya_asin.title/002-0715528-1432846?%5fencoding=utf8v=glanc	1
after six months use it one best handycam i ever tried , you just need get extra battery course touch screen protector . update : now it almost 18 month this handycam , i love it , its simple so my kids use it easy button professional you still go deeper setting set it . it worth every penny i paid it	1
this flash powerful blast many bonus controls . like three second flashing option , where you negotiate all shadow lighting options before actually shoot your first shot	1
i never avid photographer , preferring much more experience enjoy moment rather than fumbling around camera trying get perfect shot . this camera , its ease use great picture quality , gives me best both worlds . i've it over 6 months now very pleased it . only reason i give it 4 stars instead 5 one piece misleading advertising . camera touted running aa batteries , but when you read manual you learn " standard " aa alkaline batteries not recommended . you must use lithium or rechargeable batteries instead . this probably reason many reviewer complaints battery life camera shutting itself off - it just doesn't run alkalines . but i've no problems running it lithiums rechargeables . i also can't make any recommendations software one way or other . i custom setup installed usb drivers only , which work fine . i use adobe photoshop elements my editing am thrilled results	1
i love this product . i'm not much camera person . but it takes great pictures . two other people i know both it they love it too .	1
this camera sure give you new photo experience . although it takes little practice get perfect photos , result definitely something you never experienced ! unmatched other cameras , fisheye lens become favorite mine . i'd recommend this camera anyone wanting get some interesting beautiful pictures	1
this camera pretty basic cheap film camera , but it takes surprisingly good photos . i love how some my photos came out it , i caught hot air balloon show , fish eye view makes it look totally surreal . this definitely worth money	1
let me explain what this really because i buy it understand . maybe me :) ok what this basically " pull " you back into camera more . so when you taking picture you actually see outlining lens , making it circle picture . not what i expecting but its interesting i am new " real " photography so i am not sure if this usefull or really good thing but i just wanted make it clear what it really so you not spend money buy it :	1
i'm anal lot things . this item makes me feel good it . i keep all my spare batteries it my backpack . i always batteries , i always no which ready go which dead . if you carry camera or any electronic device uses aa or aaa batteries you needing get them out bottom your bag or purse , this what you'll need	1
i've serious amateur occassional professional photographer over 40 years . my experience spans early slr entries up present . i've also long-time nikon groupie . my opinion , they manufacture best equipment this type available , though recent years quality provided few tops seems closing gap . i mean canon specifically . said , i'm type photographer drags around select few lenses couple bodies so i mix match lenses films . speaking which ( films ): i am not technology-averse . i love idea digital . i shoot home movies direct dvd sony equipment . i also scan my 35mm negs/prints using canon 9950f ( excellent print scanner ) or nikon 5000ed coolscan ( best slide/neg scanner)to digital files further action photoshop . however , said , i still shoot my stills 35mm film . several reasons : current digital camera bodies simply not afford flexibility speed , sensitivity , or versatility film . i hate fact cmos sensors effectively double focal length all my lenses ( currently only one exception , canon , i think ) . i'm recording my images only currently available archival medium : film . yes , i know bytes bits supposedly archival . but 50 years now , your dvd still going readable any then-current technology ? remember beta ? or 8 track tapes ? however , daguerre matthew brady prints(both 19th century ) still . mine -- yours if you shoot film . said , few years back , i decided my eyes no longer afforded me luxury manual focus i decided go auto-focus capabilities now available , i stuck nikon bought my first n-80 . i am so happy i ! this camera simply outstanding every way , affording you ability use it simple point-and-shoot if you wish ( due its extremely fast sharp system coupled matrix metering system , on-board pop-up flash ) , well option take direct control over every aspect creative photo process intuitive easy-to-use systems . i liked it so much couple years later i bought second backup system enhancer ( meaning two loaded bodies different lens/film combinations ) . additional benefit current fad seems toward digital bodies , n-80 prices gone down significantly . interesting phenomenon merits quick observation : order get same quality resolution available good film/camera body/lens combination far cropping or enlargment capability goes , you spend neighborhood $3000 $4000 body-only camera , you're still limited duplication film sensitivity . try duplicating 3000asa film speed digital camera . good luck ! you'll blasted " noise " image ; what we used call " grain " film , i.e. loss resolution sharpness . i'm finally making move up my next big camera purchase . guess what ? it nikon f-5 . film body . what tell you ? buy this camera ! it great !	1
this my 2nd digtial slr . film days , i using nikon products . my initial foray into digital photography , i switched canon ( 10d ) just see what other side fence . after three years , i switched back nikon because nikon products suits me better . no , this not " canon sucks , nikon rules " review . one thing i learned digital photography you should really decide not camera body itself , but whole lineup ... including lenses accessories . me , nikon lens line-up works me better , not because canon worse line-up ... i'm sure lot photographers find canon line-up much more sensible . now , camera itself : i've own this camera over year sold number stock images using this camera . suffice say , i'm very satisfied its performance ; i'm not going re-iterate praises that said previous reviews . what i am compelled say not-so-great characteristics this camera : iso400 above , it not very forgiving underexposure . if you not nail exposure , even raw you see noise shadow area when you try correct exposure raw software converter . this why you hear lot whining d200 owners regarding " noise . " most them don't nail exposure first time try adjust raw converter ... then bam ! noise shadows . auto white balance becomes iffy well underexposure ; everything becomes biased magenta underexposure ; this very hard correct even post-processing . nikon creative lighting system i believe feature makes nikon little better than canon artificial lighting exposure . basically , nikon designed their flash system multiple flashes mind . nikon auto-focus engine better than most canon folks tend evangelize . afs lenses i'm positive it fast any canons . if there one thing i would like change future iterations this product : i need more than one cross-type af points ! newer pentax dslr nine out its 11 af points ! this beneficial more accurate focus . so my recommendation ... if you already nikon lenses , thinking if it worth price difference jump d40/d50/d70 . it unequivocably " yes . " if you're just starting dslr system , i say look closely what nikon/canon/pentax/olympus/leica/sigma offer whole system then decide . if you decide nikon , you won't yearning own higher d2-series model this camera ; it almost same feature set lower price	1
ergonomics : perfect . d200 not completely rubber-encased . there rubber where your hands need hold it , plastic where your hands rarely touch it . hand grip comfortable nicely concave where tips your fingers dig . battery door memory card door made plastic , hinge-pinned . simple slide latch opens battery door .... some warned latch could easily ( accidentally ) tripped . memory card door latch , however , uses more secure 45 degree pivoting latch . usb 2 video out/dc-in doors made flexible rubber , these doors extend into body camera hinges themselves . english language operating manual work art . each operating concept alpha ' numerically numbered pictoral diagram , page where function explained perfect english . reader quickly catch how this well thought out manual organized . i like depth field preview , mirror lock-up , multiple-exposure capability . continuous servo autofocus better job than any human following focusing any moving object . if you old manual-focus , film-based nikon slr lenses ' 70 ' 80 , except few rare exceptions , fit d200 . all these positive attributes remind me best , most highly-evolved film camera slr . no wonder so many photographers won over digital media .	1
i bought this camera back-up my d2x so i wouldn't change lenses much trip i'm taking alaska this summer . well let me tell you , d200 18-200mm vr lens incredible . it fast , quiet pleasure use . i've read forums 18-200 little soft . so far i totally disagree , pictures i've taken very sharp . i wish this would available when i bought my d2x . if it , i would own two d200 instead one each . highly recommended !!	1
i love this little records . it light takes great movies . great audio video quality . haven't used it enough give expert opinion , but so far , i am really happy my purchase . my child loves it too . she wiz it	1
i using this camera several weeks lots different conditions : indoors , outdoors , action , stills , etc . overall , it great camera if you looking good video performance , acceptable still performance video camera , no tapes , incredibly small size which truly fit your pocket . i not any dark video issues mentioned above . i owned many previous minidv cameras including jvc , canon elura , panasonic 3ccd , sony dcr-pc1000 . my eye , video this camera produces video good others terms sharpness color accuracy . i tested it side-by-side sony ( most recent model those shown ) , it performed same my eye sony video , although color little more accurate panasonic , still images noticeably better . i concerned getting mpeg2 camera thinking compression would cause artifacts trouble action video . i no problems either . real reason i tried this camera all above cameras broken after couple years use due broken tape handling mechanism , i thrilled idea tapeless camera ! battery lasts much longer due not drive tape , startup time great since it doesn't get tape across recording heads after you switch it . i also prefer no hard drive durability battery life issues , none hard drive cameras even close this size . now trade-offs you make this camera . first i thought it didn't go very wide-angle which disapponting ( 44mm 35mm equivalent , i think ? ) , but i tested it side-by-side sony it nearly identical , i never noticed lack wide angle sony . also , mpeg2 format bit pain . i use final cut express imovie mac , neither reads mpeg2 directly . said , there free utility which seems very good called streamclip , or you buy $20 add-on your qt player play convert mpeg2 , but it still extra step process . i believe premiere not support it either . just aware it not compatible many editing apps ubiquitous minidv conversion step required . only other camera i seriously considered ( after ruling out tapes hard drives ) sanyo xacti vpc-hd1a , which also sd-based camera . despite 5mp still image resolution , most video reviews it extremely negative . some surmised this really still camera core , marketed video camera . furthermore it not optical image stabilization , which i consider near-must such small cameras if you want smooth video . it indeed record hd , but least one review said video quality poor enough it didn't really matter . it indeed record mpeg4 , though , which natively read imovie . so if you don't mind significantly larger camera tapes , there may more compelling options like sony hdr-hc3 which records hd , or perhaps one hard-drive models . but if you're looking tapeless video camera , especially sd-based one which takes truly high quality video , this appears only real choice out there moment ( nov 2006 )	1
this second camcorder i owned , i love it . its smple easy use , picture quality whole lot better than my old higher end samsung mini dv , very easy transfer work your videos , very compact , very good camera would suggest any friend	1
i like this charger lot , yet recently lost one while traveling . i recently made mistake buying cheap replacement off ebay . ebay charger didn't work . fact , i thought ebay-charger working since indicator light worked , but batteries never actually charged . anyway , this canon cb-2lu charger i'm writing this review pricey , yet it seems worth money if you afford it . it small , works , seems charge batteries fast . conclusion , beware cheap imitation ripoffs sold ebay	1
i love this camera . i bought it my trip paris . i found it very easy use . one feature i didn't realize it video sound . i found very useful . i bought 2gb memory card go camera . one it comes doesn't hold many pictures . software easy install use . not really small enough pocket but still great camera budget	1
i really like this camera ! it fairly simple use , takes great pictures packed features . it fits nicely hand compact enough slip coat pocket or purse . we bought this camera our daughter birthday . she using it ease especially loves movie sound option . my opinion , camera winner any adult or kid wanting good all around digital camera . my only negative it battery hog . most digital cameras , you want make sure you get rechargeable batteries large memory card	1
this camera takes great , crisp photos . it easy use , great value . even close-up photos turn out great . you would think this camera more than 3.2 megapixels ! you get much larger memory card though , case most digital cameras	1
i just got this camera christmas . i hate reading directions , so i popped battery memory card i off ! very user friendly , all right options . plus , its size average cell phone . coolest thing powershot it knows which way you're holding camera , so if you hold it vertical get tall shot , viewer turns all itself . i also love you edit video camera set up slide shows . its very easy load pics onto my computer usb connection - or set up slide show tv . it even holds voice memos cute sound effects when i take pictures . this really great camera	1
i've only owned couple pairs binoculars so don't ton experience different models . but i can't imagine it getting much better than these general use . first off , they very clear bright deliver very crisp image , even turned off . but 10x there noticeable shaking image . but then ... turn it just dampens everything beautifully . even more detail revealed it kind takes my breath away every time i use them . while this initial " wow " factor dissipate over time , i can't imagine i'll regret purchasing these ever . they good . i agree others complained lens caps . but caps actually work pretty well now i've installed some 52mm b+w uv filters . caps fit pretty snuggly onto filters . also , filters haven't hindered viewing imho	1
i concur other reviewers . although binoculars heavy , they're 4 ounces lighter than my old 10x50 minolta . canon sharper , brighter , smaller , even more magnification . image stabilization works very well , although it doesn't stop moving objects ( joke ) . besides image stabilization , close focus plus ! although pricey , i believe they're well worth it . now my brother wants pair	1
recent arrival our first child prompted this purchase . i knew i wanted minidv allow me maximum editing flexibility software compatibility . i scoured internet product reviews decided get canon elura 100 this widely considered best " budget " digital camcorder . course , i decided just last stocks ran out - canon no longer make elura line . i then faced starting scratch all majors just released new cameras . i've used canon slrs years so naturally gravitated towards z-series camcorders . they didn't get great reviews though . then i spotted panasonic pv-gs85 immediately grabbed fact it ois - optical image stabilization . it uses actual optical component counteract hand shake opposed electronic jiggery-pokery other cameras this price point use . i tried out both canon panasonic electronics store difference effectiveness ois eis amazing - optical stabilization just leaps bounds better . what sold me panasonic . i went gs85 over gs80 addition snapshot capability - it take still photo memory card whilst you filming . quality isn't fantastic , but it isn't terrible either it perfect capturing stills those magical moments emailing relatives when you happen middle filming . i don't use windows , so can't comment software included , but camera works flawlessly imovie my macbook pro kino linux . video quality very good , color reproduction so far proved excellent . auto white balance takes little while adjust after turning camera ( maybe 20-30s ) so you bit ahead game . startup very quick even without fast start option where camera " goes sleep " when you close lcd rather than switching off all together . all excellent camera	1
it my husband when he diving he loves said it takes great pictures . shark mode works grea t.t he pictures very clear	1
case well made looks good . it belt loop rather than clip so you remove your belt get it or off . magnetic snap convenient , but not super secure	1
soft case made sturdy leather , which offers two distinct advantages : excellent protection , space saving . i don't like fluffy kinds because defeats purpose f30 compactness . wrest band adds convenience , but that just personally perference . magnetic door functions well also ... easy open , strong enough enclose camera . this importance because i don't want joggle around case miss any shot . i take out camera my fingers position , like cowboy bringing out his gun ready kill ... haahh , not good analogy but ya know whata mean ..	1
only negative these binoculars they come really cheesy plastic strap , which i promptly threw away . otherwise they function fine bargain binocular	1
i don't words this item ... it very very ... i'm taking best pictures i never imagin	1
christmas gift my girlfriend . she loves it . small enough always carry around . i'm actually kinda jealous ... maybe i'll buy myself	1
camera case expected . no complaints , i searched best price this item , found it here . i just think shipping charges way too high . i know sellers charge these rates , but i believe they should reconsider . it not unusual shipping charges exceed 50% price item ( such this one ) not so expensive . future , i giving my business sellers no shipping ( or low shipping charges ) . you should too	1
not big or small . lightly padded small compartment hold extra battery	1
i used this battery my olympus since i first got it five years ago , i take lot pictures , kids , vacations , ebay photos . i originally thought i would invest rechargeable batteries , but i such poor luck batteries not charging or charger not working i decided keep using this battery . 5 years , i only used 3 sets batteries . i bought my first set circuit city $20 , so this good price here amazon . i felt obligated write this review because first only review nothing battery whatsoever , yet he still gave it only one star . go figure	1
great little package ! small , compact , fits easily your pocket . took them giants stadium use my end zone seat . able see action very clearly opposite end field . easy focus my bad eyes	1
well , i bought bino my 7 year old nephew introduce him birding . he loves it , infact he pronounced it " pretty cool " . good buy considering its compact what its supposed	1
i got this little gadget few days ago i love it . i think negative reviews come people who expecting too much . device so many different things , it them pretty darn well . granted , it isn't great any one thing , but , face it , you pay lot more any device even one thing " great . " if you looking professional quality videos or photos , you pay " professional " price . if you looking amazing little gadget packs lot functions into one little package , look no further . what it worth , i took great indoor video photos , pictures came out just fine	1
