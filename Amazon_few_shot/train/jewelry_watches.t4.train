locket this cable chain so tiny , you not able put picture it . after opening box completely disappointed , i opened locket see how it worked . it would not close properly after opening . quality this necklace not good - not waste your money .	-1

this supposedly " new " item looked like it either used few times or someone left it out rain . it arrived one-page instruction sheet wrapped around plastic tool . silver knob you see left side this " tool " rusted would not turn very easily . i'm not sure how this tool effective removing stubborn watch band pins . maybe this tool effective only removing pins cheaply manufactured watches - much like this item . when i attempted use it , entire plastic body would flex i afraid it would snap if i twisted knob any further . not worth sale price it advertised . most effective way using it remove knob pin apparatus gently tap end hammer order loosen pins . this definitely not worth sale price	-1
this cute locket but far too small put any sort photo it . only use it would serve would charm never opened . not worth price	-1
though design cool , quality this pendant poor . they so light color strikingly white , which makes them appear cheaper . they look like toys ! i also bought earrings set same design i'm so disappointed both . :-( only packaging good quality this product . i suggest amazon collection makes white gold good quality similar design .	-1

i bought these my 83 year old mom , she loves jewelry helped me pick these out . we thought it would good deal price . she happy look stones when they arrived , but others noted , these stones mounted end rather deep mount ( almost 1/4 inch ) which makes them rather top heavy . unless you very thick meaty ear lobes , these earrings going droop downwards , not sit pretty your ear you would expect . needless say , my moms ear lobes very thin , soon she put them her ears , they drooped downward 45 degree angle . she very displeased these we sent them back refund	-1

read other reviews i expected something small , but decent . particular pair i received two defects : 1 . one back clasps bent so it could not provide correct tension post reliable wear 2 . one stones very large , visible black inclusion near top . it visible my naked eye ( i don't jeweler loupe ) even though it partially hidden behind one mounts . maybe i just got bad pair , but given those two problems small size stones , i sent them back not try again .	-1
earings too big ... no way knowing they big they ... nothing i wear ....	-1
very disappointed watch amazon . day/date not work delivery but i unaware it until end february when i tried manually change date . i found it broken time , week after i received watch . day/date change automatically each night . amazon refused orepalce it because i band adjusted . seiko refused oreplace it but said they would repair it it back me 3-4 weeks ! i purchased it reputable local store i could exchanged it new watch .	-1
i purchased this pair earrings my 5 year-old granddaughter wear flower girl my niece wedding . when purchase arrived , they too small my granddaughter . therefore i return them	-1

amendment below review ( mar 07 ): my wife really likes them wears them all time . i'd upgrade least one more star , maybe two if i could . ---------------------------------------------------------- my son wanted buy mama present this christmas so naturally , we turned amazon computer skill training ability view lot products easily . earrings arrived today ( very quickly ) but stone not nearly robust picture depicts . stone white , like fake diamond . when viewed other kinds light , you see slight tint blue but nothing like picture . issue - clasp or ear stud flimsy . i may return them ( need ask my son ) but i don't think these earrings last more than couple wears . positive side - it really nice design	-1
these earrings look like pieces glass ; not diamonds -- no sparkle all . i feel i wasted my money . caveat emptor	-1

watch beautiful , graceful , even elegant ... but clasp designed designer who likes complexity . this , all mesh bands , clasp hell !!! out box , it needed manual figure out ... this first warning sign . setting up wrist size awkward hard . then putting watch hooking one mechanism over some rod very hard , then there more steps , each one real challenge . then when i took my watch off , i must pulled wrong lever zip watch feel groundward . happy say it ended up bed , it gone hard floor , i may looking new crystal buying experience.an older person hands no longer working well find this watch impossible put take off . i could never ever recommend this watch , not it looks , but just band clasp ... foolish foolish person who designed it	-1
this bracelet actually really nice , but too bad it so cheaply made mine broke 2 weeks . it easily fixed all i need get new end-clasps attach them leather braid , but i hoping better made product	-1

i never recieved this watch 30 or so days later amazon refunded my payment . i don ' understand why this supplier could not come up such common item but i got my money back so i am not upse t.t his why i try not buy amazon seller , preffering buy directly form amazon site	-1
this total waste money , it real cheapo like something out cracker jack box .	-1
watch quite lightweight comes good features . however , i think it very hard use . you hit buttons just right certain amount times change anything . if you lose directions , you never remember how change it . it took me over 6 months change it . i many people try alter it , but it no prevail . additionally , watch not very water resistant . i went swimming couple times now i hardly see time due water . i would recommend paying more lot better watch . this waste money !	-1

i've this watch 5 months now threaded crown or body stripped , so crown no longer locks place . i've tried contacting citizen waranty they say it not covered . citizen claims i over tightened it or cross-threaded it while screwing down , so it cost $50-100 repair . total joke ! i'll never purchase citizen watch again . i've always thought they cheap begin . this just confirms my thoughts	-1

i've bought lot amazon over years . this first watch though . i've bought owned several seiko watches . this probably worst experience i've ever amazon seiko too ! watch came box looked water damaged . watch itself broken clasp . it looks beautiful , but i bought it gift . when she opened it , clasp refused lock . its never gone far enough time set or even tried . amazon actually tried sleeze out it telling me follow waranty pocedures . how long she wait her birthday gift ? warranty process could take weeks	-1
i order amazon frequently , am consistently happy products service . however , i very disappointed this item -- perhaps my own fault failing notice no dimensions given item description . i wrongly assumed charm would approximately size my thumbnail , surprised when it arrived i could barely find it tiny blue velvet bag contained it . it miniscule -- 1 cm long 1/2 cm wide ! enamel applied unevenly , though charm tiny , it evident enamel thicker some places , contains air bubbles others . it might cute charm bracelet purse or shopping theme , but would not work pendant , i intended . i'm sending it back refund	-1
not they appear !, march 8 , 2007reviewer : rappster ( denver , co ) - see all my reviews i ordered these earrings ' gold box ' special waited eagerly them arrive . they such disappointment , i returned them next day . i not expect diamonds huge , based their cttw , but earrings themselves miniscule ! they look like they made children . i tried one earring couldn't even see earring my ear , much less tell there any diamonds -- it looked like i didn't even earring !	-1
good : bought watch feb 1 2007bad : first watch showed up dead - not working . battery ? good : amazon replaced next daybad : second watch showed up dead- not working . battery ? good : worked fine when i battery replaced .

i bought nike triax c5 heart rate monitor watch year ago . strap already falling apart near bezel . watch 2 yr warranty but not cover strap or crystal , even if problem poor workmanship .	-1
good news watch case quite nice . now could-be-improved points . it sized weird . it lot larger than you think . add it bracelet rather small so now i removed single link i barely get it over my average sized wrist , once it it still too loose . weird , but true . frankly it good looking , but i don't think i'll get one .	-1
pendant nice however pewter wrap around kind ruins entire design . it not go center design . i think it would look better slightly tarnished silver look . pewter just too dull this design necklace not work well pendant either .	-1
pic online not true representation - these more like baby cuffs . so embarassed give xmas gift	-1
these earrings looked great i really liked them but less than month , posts broke completely off earrings now completely useless	-1
i recived watch it fine , however i want complain above amazon way pack purchases , amazon pack tiny watch box huge box , then i pay lots money paying mail forwarder because this policy . i use mail forwarder miami caracas ( venezuela ) i spread 19$ instead 5$ because box size i recived huge box full air bags . this situation not first time happend i hope amazon compense me any way	-1
this great watch wear casually or formally . it works very well , easy read stunningly elegant its design . amazon fantastic place get it . best price shipping quick	-1
honest ... when i saw picture description area , it looks like awesome watch !, but when i opened package i wanted return it . if you see picture you appreciate digital information , like thermometer , digital hour , day , month , etc ... but real life , you must incline it until you able see it .. other thing , thermometer , not so accurate because your body heat affects it . when my digital home thermometer marks 72 , watch marks 92 so if you want accurate measure you need take it off , wait 20min 30min reach accurate measure ( this information extracted manual ) . so conclusion , if you want watch thermometer built-in ... just keep looking other models .	-1
this locket dime-sized -- much smaller than i anticipated . it also very plain looked cheap . mother-of-pearl locket much better	-1
closure earings not secure , result , everytime anything brushed against your ear closure came undone , within two weeks , i lost one earing . this type closure not practicle anyone who remotely active	-1
this watch such poor quality second hand fell off third day use . cost shipping claim defect under warranty more than initial cost watch . total disappointment waste time money , don't buy this watch .	-1
i wear this watch every day i usually work outside . i am very pleased features durability . it seemed daunting work features forst , but short time instruction book made them accessable easy . i only two complaints : one metal band developed slight " squeak " when i move my wrist sometimes . tin man needs oil . second despite placed huge window every night , watch not always get time signal ft . collins . i gone long several days without getting it - but when you consider most watches not get it all , i am ok spotty reception	1

i've owned several watches , including older g-shock casio men g-shock atomic solar watch # gw1400da-9av ( among others ) . first , there so many g-shock models choose . you could bought # gw1400da-9av ( stainless steel model ) same price ($75 ) during week july 24 , 2006 . this watch simply everything one ever needs time functionality : solar power ( no need daily rewinding , kinetic body movement , or batteries ) , synch atomic clock colorado ( ultimate accuracy ) , time zone adjustment ( ease jet setters ) , light button ( which also goes off when you tilt your wrist ) , stop watch functionalities , day/date functionalities , countless other time-related functions . this respect , it much more functional than patek ( even complicated wrist watch models , or more mundane rolex , etc . ) . course , it lowly casio , costing mere $75 ( vs . $ 75,000 low end complicated patek)buyers should aware watch purtty bulky , probably 5/8 3/4 . thick . one needs sporty forearm/wrist go this watch . fun wearing it couple times year , price , just look it part collection watches , i'd highly recommend it .	1
i returned these , because they too large me . fair zina , they described , i wasn't sure they would work . only reason i'm not rating them 5 , returned them , i don't know how long clasp would work . i kept gold small hoops i bought same time -- very happy them . zina product descriptions exceptionally good	1
i got these today so shocked when they arrived , wow , these amazing hoops 25 dollars . i am more than pleased , don't idea what some other reviewers complaining , i am floored price quality same time . free shipping these must , great gift idea everyday earrings . amazon got them me matter 4 days i'm hawaii , they also came beautifully packaged , i'm love them , don't let these sell out	1

apart great look seem durability , it strange feature such kind dial . you chronograph , but you not idea where it stops . 23 or 26 seconds ? difficult find out such dial ..	1
even if you not , buy this watch . i am nurse , much like many other reviewers . fact , i bought it due their reviews . it fantastic watch . easy read , illumination option handy date feature . only trouble i size band ( too long ) . i take it jeweler take few links out , however , directions doing this yourself make it looks easy ( it not ) . don't even bother looking watch , this one steal	1
i bought this watch because i wanted something inexpensive , but still professional looking . i like lightness watch , thin size , simple design . it make audible ticking sound louder than i would like , but still not very noticeable . if you haven't seen other comments getting watch sized , pay attention . i took it professional jewelry repair shop , they still couldn't remove some extra links without leaving some minor scratches . i would recommend any size adjustments professional jeweler who selling this brand watch while . jeweler i went good reputation , but not sell skagen .	1
other people pointed out , this very solid watch . i really am not afraid it breaking if it falls , or anything like . however , this partly due its enormous thickness . it not diameter watch surprisingly large - it how thick it . if you small wrist , this watch probably not you , it very noticeable . it also not especially light , obviously , but it feels comfortable enough . it keeps excellent time , i've no problems automatic signal searching	1
it very stylish watch i get compliments it all time , but display functions like stopwatch , alarm , date display small hard see . also , date off i haven't able properly set it	1
watch excellent timekeeper . automatic calibration really works ( although some reviews i'd read indicate otherwise ) . i like dial , features , ( changes dst , calendar knows how many days month , etc . ) not , though , travel this watch while without instruction book . four control buttons take some time figure out , most them so rarely used when you need stopwatch , or one various other options , you'll likely need book ( least i ) . also understand this big watch -- probably least twice thick watch you're used considerably heavier . it hang up jacket or anything long sleeves . shock , though , tougher than hammer if you don't mind bulk i'd recommend it . rlm iow	1
i own many watches , including some very expensive ones . such quality looks 1/10 price ! this watch classy quality second none . awesome !	1
baeutiful watch , offered great price . delivered very quickly . a++	1
effect thousends $$$$ watch . i love it . one best deals i`ve amazon this last years	1
i read reviews this diamond just before christmas when it sale $99.00 . diamonds better then expected i consider them fine purchase 99 bucks . no visible flaws . i am sure if i used loop i could find some but no visible yellow these clarity fair . their great $99.00 diamonds	1
very handsome easy-to-read face date window ; especially like day/date display . most watches this price range feature date only . excellent value	1
yeah , it money clip alright . going overfilled wallet down 5 card/cash only clip surprisingly easy . i found i carrying whole lot " stuff " my wallet i didn't need just causing my wallet get bigger bigger . just 5 cards , couple receipts little cash this clip much more comfortable , easier manage , looks lot better than my old wallet . i agree previous reviewer clip forcing cash bunch up under clasp when it closed . however , it doesn't take long it become second nature keep cash pulled out bit before securing it down . i haven't used any other money clips so i can't compare this one others , but if you use wallet i say this , hands down , my new preference	1
ring better real life than picture , but you still get what you pay .	1
i just recently my ears pierced needed something small i could wear continually daily casual basis without earrings looking too dressy . these earrings just perfect purpose . they simple elegance genuine pearls sterling silver findings . they even confortable enough wear while sleeping . i am wearing white pearl set right now . love them !	1
all right so these earrings absolutely adorable ! they fun go anything ! good size . good quality . i would buy someone gift	1
all natural pearls , shapes not perfect . only cultured pearls perfect , because man controls them . dye uniform size perfect , big enough they seen easily . colors ; pink , white , gold , lavender clear . even green clear green , just not my favorite green	1
this watch pretty much exactly what you would expect picture . case bit thick backplate plastic , but might reduce overall weight compensate size . it certainly doesn't feel like lead weight my fossil watches seem . i smaller than average wrist it easily sizable down proper tools . atomic time reception good even far south i am it rarely misses updates . you force update if you feel like it its really easy . what not easy initial setup . i've never really read manual most electronics , but you need it this one . keep safe place when battery dies . least now , price deal functionality quality	1

gift , this bracelet not disappoint . it appears just ( or better ) it picture . only downside , gentlemen thicker bone structure , there not any give , nor they provide extra links make it bit more comfortable . otherwise , one cannot go wrong selecting it	1
this color price special i liked look picture so i chose this model . i found silver silver makes it bit more difficult read than i would liked but it adequate . good , accurate movement other invicta timepieces i've owned or known also . this one quite heavy feel more pricey timepiece . mine running 3 seconds slow per week which doesn't seem bad but former invictas i've bit better than this . update prior review .... now watch limbered up , accuracy improved i've hardly needed touch it	1

obviously pearls flawed , but because their size you can't tell even short distance away . they're super cute , but i suggest getting them 2 or 3 time they look bit awkward their own	1
inexpensive aquamarine usually washed-out blue color . not these babies ! you'll fool your friends into thinking you've spent double	1

i bought this watch my son , marine , serving iraq , because he requested sturdy digital alarm . this one large face which he says extremely easy read any light , especially night . it comfortable , sits close wrist very little profile . he loves it , asked me order second one because he wants back-up !	1
this pleasant surprise money craftsmanship quite good . only criticism adjustment band bit tedious . it certainly worth while durable product . i would certainly buy this product again	1
actually , it fabulous watch . it looks great , everything you would expect , joy look - i've swapped it watch my wife bought me wedding present " just get used it bit " ( which obviously she less than pleased ) , everytime i look it i see really great watch i'm really pleased i bought . however , if there design fault , it would this : when you start then stop stop watch , you cannot reset without pressing holding reset button ; surely it would better one-touch reset ? also , timer - loop 3 ( which continuous countdown ) reset button ( again press hold ) resets timer zero ( you would expect ' set ' button ) , set button ( press hold ) resets timer original timer setting ( eg 5 mins ) - surely these wrong way round ? all bit odd , but sort-of ok once you get used it . seems bit sloppy though its design . nonetheless , overall excellent watch . i'm really please i bought it it very useful triathlon events , using lap stopwatch	1
i've watch 3 weeks i really like it better than i expected	1
quality product great just advertised . delivery time excellent it promised week delivery but arrived next day ! great company business	1

these earrings very pretty -- not too big not too small , just right . price you can't go wrong . gift box they arrived sort cheesy , but they me so i didn't mind . if i giving them gift i'd put them prettier box before giving them recipient . overall very pretty earrings , good value , no complaints	1

this dual watch winder awesome . not only it ultra stylish but it works great . although i expensive tastes when it comes watches , i cannot justify paying more than $100 watch winder no one ever see . this dual watch winder works great my tag heuer-link my movado . it truly great buy , no reason spend more money	1
i love watch expecially , black white color . looks casio old , modern twist . watch very basic design . dual digital , fully funtional chronograpgh watch . one other thing ; it very easy set . only problem , it not back lit . so digital part watch useless night ( if incase you happen doing something dark , night ) . this only disappointing fact wrist watch . you might think watch cost $60 self supplied light , but it not . sad . shame casio . apart , i love watch	1
this nice watch give accurate time . i gave only 4 stars because it took me hard time pull crown adjust time	1

i wanted automatic watch while , i attracted green trim this model . watch big heavy . this probably true most automatics . my issue it seems too thick . i think glass/crystal back adds millimeter or so . band slight problem i probably fix . right where metal band contacts case , one side band bent slightly causing band interfere rotating bezel . i may caused this when adjusting linkage , or it may come delivered way . i think i could simply detach band squeeze it back into its proper shape . i actually left it alone i not want bezel rotate , defect not visible . far accuracy , it seems gained 20-30sec week . i seen watch store tried it , i would probably not bought it . i not happy when it arrived , but i worn it week , i am now glad i picked i t.t he only other issue i wish luminous markings brighter . i purposely picked black face easier see markings dark ( opposed white face ) , but i better luck other watches	1

i am army because this watch it pluses minuses . i travel world , so multiple time zones awsome . time stamp feature great when i need help remember when specific event happened . solar power . it great you don't worry batteries , but most watch batteries last close five years anyway . army i find myself doing lots night missions , i go months without seeing sun because i catch up sleep during day . well , this doesn't really work solar powered watch . i get , but it hassle some times . all-in-all , this great watch , if you don't work night then solar power won't problem you , except maybe winter when you wear coats cover your wrist . just take into consideration when purchasing solar powered watch	1

but no calories count . i love this watch despite , it well designed , chest strap also links machines gym ( most say polar ready ) .. so great surprisethe chest strap battery user-serviceable well watch , so you don't send it manufacturer ( like polar hr ) . overall i think good buy , but missing calories count , would my only upgrade .	1

i really like face style watch . i like mesh band but wire may snag clothing or fabric	1
this my first watch over $100 dollars . i just getting into watches wanted something looked great would stand test time . this watch beautiful . polished look won't last forever if worn daily , but even when battle-scarred this watch still looks classy . i love battery replacement pretty much non-issue this watch . its titanium design makes it so light comfortable you might forget you wearing it . dial window pretty resilient , but i would not test too much . this most part dress watch . i also invicta abyss automatic diving watch i wear occasionally , but i don't wear it nearly much i wear my citizen . my citizen my favorite watch all time . its versatility longevity impressed me three years i owned it . i recommend this watch anyone who wants beautiful watch dressy still practical most daily life . i always get compliments it also . this watch good buy .	1

i just got this watch christmas present . it gorgeous . only thing it little bigger than i would like it . face so femanine , but size makes it little masculine . face inch half diameter , band little over half inch wide . because it so pretty i am keeping it , however if you prefer small dainty watch , maybe this one isn't you . my friends telling me bigger watches " " now so maybe they're right ??	1
this my second skagen watch . my first one , which almost identical my new one , lasted ten years daily use . i love two-tone combination gold stainless steel . my only disappointment , glance , it difficult tell minute hand second hand . i think hour minute hands should slightly more heavier than second hand . otherwise , i love profile design this watch including where comfortable mesh band meets watch face	1

this probably one casio least expensive wave ceptors . it synchs every day indoors watch case that not window . digital display shows day , date , other info such which time zone , what time it synched . i'm just concerned analog , digital display , receiving every day make it battery eater . it available different dials , but blue seems most common . i give it 4 stars because luminous paint not very bright . crystal acrylic-scratches easily . but that not really issue because i 15 watches , this one gets very little wrist time	1

this same model watch purchased me 20-years ago my 10th birthday it still keeps 100% accurate time . rubberized band tends out after 2-3 years everyday use . i would suggest replacing it stainless-steel metal band , which purchased any major retailer . metal band also adds attractiveness watch .... least my opinion . overall , fantastic product !	1
i bought this clip gift my husband , both he i very pleased it . it little small , but very attractive looks even better after engraved . reference previous review , it not hold thick " wad " bills , but it holds few hundred dollars ( $20s ) quite nicely .	1
excellent watch . large digits aging baby boomer . easy readability indiglo . flix feature bit balky	1
i bought this watch when it sale while ago . face quite large , measuring 1-5/8 " its outside rim , making it little too big people small wrists . band , though , enough holes it fit most anyone , though it too bit uncomfortable small wrists . leather band fairly thick , but two stays included keep end band flapping . watch face silver brushed finish . many claim face " lot going " , which true four sub-dials , but it keeps style pilot watch . these subdials show month , date , moon phase , day , all deep red hands cocentric-design silver background . time easy read red-tipped hands hour ticks . there additional ticks , five per minute , which seem extraneous only there design . bezel series numbers allowing conversion calculations volume ( liters , us gallons , imperial gallons ) distance ( kilometers , nautical miles , statute miles ) , which probably useful if you're pilot , but not many others . best design feature push-button adjustments . while time familiar crown pulled turned , day , date , month all advanced simple push one three buttons . this much easier than pull out tiny crown just right tick then turn . watch also water resistant 100m but i never tried it . whole , watch looks good keeps form pilot watch . due its leather band , it more informal watch , works best bigger wrists . thinner or metal band slighly more comfortable fit would nice	1
i love this watch , it looks great very stylish . i highly suggest purchasing this watch . only one problem fact it hard size , i would consider purchasing this store	1
great working watches . much better than cheapo kit i got off ebay . nice , neat case .	1

these watches very different color size . anyone looking cute accessory would enjoy these watches	1
it so colorful attractive kids . they really fun this watch best part , your own watch rest while ..	1
this replacement identical ring i lost . i glad it backon my finger	1

i got this ring my girlfriend her birthday . we both loved it , it really quite beautiful . yet we still can't put it back together . it apart two months now , it really disappointing . if you're amazing putting things together , than you'll like it . if you're not , you'll probably still like it , but you might wan leave it together	1
i love this ring . it looks great , perfect fit , exactly described company . silver insanity delivers quickly fun products	1
best price pair 7mm gold ball earring i've seen long time . i feel like i got lucky	1
those who feel 7mm too big ; they not . those who feel quality may marginal ; quality superior . i worn them several months straight - never removing them they fully met my expectations . i recommend them without reservation	1
basic problem this kit its most essential piece . blue plastic link remover not come replacement pins . it requires focus properly align tool push pin friction-fitted watch band link pin . novice wll almost certainly bend or snap push pin some point . when i called company replacement pin , representative didn't hesitate offer it mail without charge . so , why not include few kit ? kit long nose pliers good quality needed extract watch band dislodged link pin . tweezers ( six ) screwdrivers useful some situations , but small hammer make flush replaced link pin always useful . my kit came instructions but why not illustration ? kit list price one hundred dollars doesn't add up . hardware store sell comparable quality long nose pliers ten dollars . tweezers set jewelry screwdrivers easily available . link remover specialized tool but it plastic . sale price $25 this fair value , but you want ask couple replacement pins your order	1
i bought two pairs this price . i put one away extra gift . they even lovilier when you see them person than they look page . real 5plus star deal !!!	1
two-toned crossover design these hoops adds more interest pizzazz standard hoop . size just right me : big enough show off twist design but not so big it overwhelming . i also like weight : lighter than they appear so i don't feel like i am carrying load my ears . i also happen like hinge snap type closure . good looking gift box , even if it just gift myself . why not five stars ? - wish everything i want costs least 10% less	1
this great looking watch vendor very straight forward fulfilling purchase ( no hassles whatever ) . main difficulty watch impossible read low light/dark conditions . it no light silver hands against silver face don't provide enough contrast read low light conditions ( like restaurant )	1
hey , i've contemplating buying these hoops while , but their new price helped me make decision . i got them just 2 days they very well-made closures solid , feels like you'll never loose them . they perfect , not too big , not too small light-weight . i also like they kind thickiesh , very noticeable ans shiny . bargain ! thanks amazon	1

got my watch few days back . first thing one notices , it nicely packaged . however , disappointment came when i learned crystal not sapphire advertised here ( usually it stamped backcase ) , but less expensive mineral . i wrote croton customer service 2 emails regarding this issue , got no reply - so much one reviewer claim " best customer service company america " ... i finally got confirmation amazon ( very promptly - i pleasantly surprised ) , crystal fact mineral - so why haven't they updated this product description ? after all , it makes huge difference , since sapphire much more expensive . nice solid case bracelet ( clasp looks bit weak ) , crystal back . printing face looks kind cheap . glow dark stuff not good - hardly holds any " charge " . better than my $50 casio , but overall , despite low price ($75 ) . i wish now i saved my money invested something tried like seiko automatic instead . my next watch seiko black monster	1

i really love this watch get compliments it all time , but just couple things bothered me led me leave 4 star rating instead 5 . - my resin strap started cracking within 1 year i looked high low many store specialty watch shops replacement . turned out strap pretty much custom no standard ironman replacement strap would fit it exactly . i call timex customer service obtain replacement , so i got 1 extra just case . i tried replace strap myself , but it super difficult . timex used really tight non-springed pin i only able get one pins partially out . i started damaging metallic casing , so i took it watch repair shop finish what i couldn't complete . repairman thought it going easy task , but it wasn't . he said it took long time pry pin out it broke he tried remove it . when he finally got it out , he used spring-loaded pin instead make it easier next time . oh yeah , he replaced strap . - week ago i tossed watch kitchen counter backplate fell off . i tried snap it tap it back , but wouldn't go . seems like it tight fit . looks like i'll visiting watch repair store again . other than these two issues , i love this watch . i think most men enjoy this watch , just aware straps hard find ... replace	1

i bought this my wife this christmas ( gave it her early -- couldn't help myself ) . this normally wouldn't kind thing i picked out her . she says i good taste jewelry , but i usually choose either diamonds or colored semiprecious stones her . this seemed kind plain picture . nevertheless , it her wish list , so i bought it . one thing note pendant relatively small -- but not too small . it shows up nicely long she wearing something like turtleneck or other plain sweater . it would get lost if she wore busier pattern . also -- this my one disappointment piece -- it " one-sided " . other words , way it appears picture way it appear wearer . you can't turn it around form " " shape . this because back pendant flat , filligree not really visible . not huge deal , though . nice piece , overall	1
fairly pleased these . i like anklet bracelet this style quite bit more , but these not bad all . i kind wished crystals string flexible such person move their head they would not always stay straight line . i mean don't get me wrong ... earrings dangle move . they look all mounted silver rod , which swing top . maybe this reason , but i think they'd look nicer mounted loose cord . all i know i'd complain lack structure symmetry . anyway ... damned picky person , these quite nice	1
this great knock-around watch well great dive watch . if you're thinking buying one awhere it automatic watch , once called autowind watch . this watch doesn't use battery wound movement your arm . if you set it down couple days , it stop . i guess we're all too use quartz battery watches remember old days winding watches	1

buen producto buen costo . me ha funcionado perfectamente desde que lo adquiri mantiene mis relojes en hora cuando lo necesito . no le doy las 5 estrellas porque es pl�stico pensaba que la parte gris era de aluminio u otro material . de todos modos es un buen producto hace el trabajo , si es comparado con los demas de este tipo que son sumamente caros .	1

looking tiny studs second holes ? these probably what you looking . they're gold so they won't irritate sensitive ears like cheap versions kids always buy . good price , boxed individually , so you could share them around if you so inclined . however since they small , prongs get " pokey " if you sleep them .	1

first i thought i sent wrong watch because gold such light color -- not all brassy gold picture . i even went back my order make sure it filled correctly . when i sat my computer , near window , investigate my order further i saw gold there , but it very subtle color gold . i actually like this gold better than overwhelming gold shown picture . i am giving it my daughter today her 30th birthday . i hope she loves it much i .	1
person this lovely necklace looks even better than pictures . it larger than it looks site but it very striking looks great . however , ring it comes wear very tight - plan taking pendant off ring wear it your own chain . it definitely worth money , especially since price dropped	1

i using triax c5 year half no problems whatsoever . using it least 4 times week tae-bo mountain biking . excellent price/quality	1
i've this watch around 18 months now . it tough , looks good doesn't mark it yet . it loses out two places though . firstly , it remarkably short " standby " time . take it off early friday night then sleep late saturday it more than likely stopped . take it off day alternate dress watch there no chance it'll still going . secondly - i've spoiled electronic watches not adjust date month end 28 30 day months so that pain . other hand , ripoff prices i pay battery my citizen changed ( mandatory water seal testing ) make it well worth hassle	1
what i wanted , when i wanted it , time , right pric	1
quick , what difference higher end citizen watch tag or omega or rolex ? price ! not only citizen watch made incredibly high standards but it looks outstanding never needs battery all this fraction price other watches . even citizen price increase december 1 last year calibre 2100 titanium other citizen models this price range ridiculously under-priced . i currently own four citizen eco drive solar watches three them titanium models . i own gold toned stainless steel moon phase watch , titanium nighthawk , titanium skyhawk , calibre 2100 . they all superb but i must say 2100 most impressive bunch . 2100 also easy read operate . so while my james bond omega seamaster watch sits drawer waiting me find time send it expensive repairs my wife rolex loses time , my citizen watches just keep trucking !!!	1
very happy these earrings . i enjoy two tone gold jewelry happy quality these earrings once they arrive . you won't disappointed this purchase	1
ok let me honest , never wanted pilot(ok maybe blue angel pilot ) , don't really care all functions dial ; this watch just looks good ! love it ! reviews big or heavy scared me bit , not case . this watch screams quality , i've several comments it . little confusing set first , but fine once you get hang it . definitely love watch look quality , backlight fine when you need it . very happy my purchase	1
pool , bike , run ; this watch it all . even when not racing this watch great daily wear easy navigate through all options . multiple time zones alarms make it easy traveler watch fits small wrists nicely	1
these earrings so perfect i no plans take them out . i shopping tiny hoop earrings least year , but i never saw what i wanted . everything i examined too big or looked like it would hurt when i slept them or they'd get caught towel when i dried my hair . recently , i thought looking childrens ' earrings began my search amazon , not really expecting find anything . i ordered these chance ; things rarely look same hand they online , but return policy generous ( no 20% restocking fee ) . less than week later , i received earrings remarkably sturdy their diminutive size , barely noticeable when i slept , not snag towel . only negative aspect endless hoop design they incredibly hard put my big , adult fingers ! i spent almost 15 minutes struggling my own until i enlisted helper . but they now snugly place look perfect . wish these available white gold or platinum	1
these really adorable earrings arrived fast ! they came black velvet pouch easy gift giving	1
this very attractive watch - much nicer than picture depicts . it deep blue sunburst dial ( much like skagen shown amazon ) . it very slender band standard double latch design . band very easy adjust(takes couple minutes most ) . besides accurate ( expected ) it lot detail dial , ( e.g. chrome around date window ) easy view all lighting situations . but it not light . large face numbers dial make viewing very easy . highly recommended	1
good : 1 . bought it $139 50% off . 2 . i concerned solar battery power . watch not get exposed much sunlight most my weekdays spent inside office or home . but it not lost its power so far , looks like it work fine tubelight exposure . bad : 1 . watch band pulls my hair . it really gets into my nerve when i am driving or immersed my work . 2 . it would nice some kind battery power indicator . 3 . no perpetual calendar . you change date once every non-31 day months . you cannot change it 9pm 6am something like . weird . not buy it $275 original price	1
i previously bought citizen eco-drive blue angels skyhawk stainless steel digital/analog watch . it beautiful look but hard read because busy dial very low contrast digital lcd subdials . i returned watch bought corso . two things this watch attracted me : ( 1 ) light weight titanium case bracelet , ( 2 ) easy-to-read dial . i quickly easily read off time , date , day week this watch . skyhawk , this wasn't possible without reading glasses . bracelet deserves special mention . it come locking pin , it integrates nicely watch case . titanium finish bracelet unusual . parts it brushed/matte metal finish ( typically seen titanium watches ) , other parts links highly polished . this makes bracelet very attractive , but i am wondering whether titanium bracelet might actually combination stainless steel titanium . all all , this great watch very attractive price .	1
great product ! free shipping ( lt ; 5 days ) . i love this watch . i bought christmas present . $100 less than any jewelry store . just visit store , write down model nimber , definitely buy this site ( least $25 cheaper than any other site i found )	1

my husband actually purchased this me christmas . my previous watch bulova . it 12 years old , two clasps only 3 battery replacements ! this new one lot live up . it certainly exceeded my expectations . i love this new design , size perfect . it little larger without too bulky . diamonds around face just enough bling without looking tacky . i get lot compliments my new watch . bulova certainly my first choice	1
when i first saw this necklace , i considered it one best amazon offer , usual i assumed it would not great image made it out i right . first all , it smaller then it looks picture here , but more importantly , my copy , one indentations line inside dragons missing . but don't get me wrong , it just small imperfection , i still think it great desig	1

i received seiko " black monster " basically photos don't it justice . this very big bold watch it seems all reviews i've read positive . price such steal this watch , it very competitive other diver watches costing 2 or 3 times price tag . i picked up one stainless steel bracelet ( which work art itself ) . only complaint i time frame delivery ... i selected 1 day shipping feature additional $14.98 but it took almost 3 days get here . it no big deal ... but it should more clear when i ordering . there little note stated " if ordered within next 2 hours you get 1 day shipping "	1
i love it . i bought 4 all my sisters . i love it they love it ..	1
there far too much metal stone thats there . although this shouldn't pose problem those seeking some serious accessories , i disappointed pictures gave me impression it far more stone than metal .	1
