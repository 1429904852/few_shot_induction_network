my daughter earlier version one shown so it possible they addressed some these issues : 1 ) most games 1 minute time out which really frustrating my kids2 ) " oh that not so good " - if i hear barbie say one more time i may just throw this thing out nearest window . my daughter get score game she feels really good barbie says , " oh that not so good , but you'll better bit more practice " this broken my daughter down into tears more than once . 3 ) there no parental controls . i wanted turn off or lengthen timer . i expected those sorts features oregon scientific . right now most fun thing my kids it play flower fun game ( like hangman ) type " icup " if you looking newer version this i would strongly recommend playing demo few minutes check it out	-1

this looks like such great toy , packaging really impressive , but don't fooled like we . i assumed paying close 25 dollars it would somewhat durable-just reasonable durability-i don't expect much plastic toys ... but this really really bad . you might also think paying much would give you things like closable doors ... you know , 99 cent matchbox cars ' doors stay closed , but space shuttle doors don't-which limit it " fun " factor . " movable arm " just free floating plastic stick simply stuck into hole .. it doesn't even stay . " launch pad " fuel tank/boosters down right horrible . they don't connect shuttle , which disapointed all us , especially my son . it so cheaply made , i really can't believe it wasn't bought dollar store . my son so excited this set . but after playing it just few minutes he hasn't gotten it out again . i would definately not recommend this	-1
i bought this my daughter her 11th birthday . after playing game once , she asked me if i could take it back . she said game boring because it so limited far what you could game . my daughter always played lot " simulated life " video games ( i.e. , sims , animal crossing ) online games ( i.e , club penguin ) . i suspect this why she found this game limiting . other games she played portray more intricate " life " therefore draw player greater degree . my advice would consider what your daughter used before buying this . if your daughter no experience these types games , this game probably fine . however if your daughter previously played simulated life games , she probably find this one lacking .	-1

while my son enjoyed illustrations anf fun content books this set , i felt it disappointing learning tool beginning readers because it moves much too quickly . first book just letters letter sounds . very introductory . second book introduces three letter words right off no transition all like 2 letter blends . ok me since it phonetic 3 letter words , but page 2 we already " leaping " 4 5 letter words page 3 they already introducing sight word - " " double consonant word - " cannot " . i thought pace frustrating my son . i hoping/expecting book devoted just blends and/or 3 letter words . instead this program organized vowels letter introduced first . i don't see problem , but i expecting more phonetic 3 letter words start introducing harder 4 5 letter words maybe book 3 sight words coming later , like maybe book 4 . unfortunately , you can't see exactly what your getting until you open box . nonetheless , audio entertaining children music humor thrown reward stickers , poster , ribbon fun way recognize your child achievement . practice game basically just like word whammer fridge phonics product but cards instead magnets	-1
i high hopes this game , but played it friend last night appalled number confusing questions just plain incorrect answers . example , one question asks , " which these animals not found exclusively south america : ( ) chinchilla , ( ) sloth , ( ) guinea pig , ( ) spring buck " . ruling out zoos , my friend reasoned since zillions kids us pet guinea pigs , answer must . alas , no ; correct answer " ( ) spring buck " no explanation . they mean animals their natural habitat ? we aren't sure . question not clearly written . question asks , " word `berserk ' derived : ( ) norse god ; ( ) german `crazy life ' , ( ) tropical plant " . i read this my friend said , " none these right answer . " word `berserk ' comes germanic branch language tree means `bear-shirt ' . game says correct answer " norse god . norse mythology , god `berserker ' always fought state frenzy . " there no such norse god . who wrote these questions ? one aspects trivia games i enjoy prospect learning something process playing ; this game concerns me because i not know which answers incorrect . learning standpoint , badly written questions poorly researched answers make this frustrating intellectually dangerous game .	-1

i just finished world largest crossword puzzle last night . it one heck project -- approximately equivalent 200 slightly oversized daily crossword puzzles . i'm going love hanging puzzle my wall -- it really something behold when it all . but it also big undertaking requires great deal patience perserverance . puzzle itself moderately difficult , but made more so fact somewhere during revision ( it re-done once ) or perhaps during original construction some errors made . because this , many clues don't match answers . add fact author uses many hundreds , possibly even thousands , abbreviations specific certain field ( e.g. " abbreviation used electrical engineering " ) no lay person ever chance knowing , you've got what exercise frustration . you work hours one small section only later find out clue doesn't fit answer . i'm generally pretty dogged completing crosswords until letter perfect , but that not possible here . so i sacrifice bit my honor force myself give up after couple passes through ups downs . still , it 98+ percent solvable , which pretty good when you consider how intricate puzzle how hard it must create . overall , i enjoyed process am pleased result . if you've got time energy , i highly recommend this .	-1

i thought art certain charm , used strictly picture book children who can't yet read , i think it quite nice . ( too bad you can't make up your own story go it . ) moment child starts read , though -- better hide it quick , because ... unfortunately , book reads like condensed communist manifesto kids ( others noted ) , or socialist agenda primer . i don't know sure that what marcus pfister aim , i'm not going speculate his politics . he three kids may raise them he likes , indulge any such philosophical musings float his boat . yes , i suppose sharing nice . certainly sharing one talents abilities betterment others great thing -- but america , we get paid ( charity voluntary , not coerced ) . furthermore , stripping yourself what makes you unique interesting ( not necessarily better , just unique interesting ) , or giving away all your possessions , lousy way make keep friends , isn't it ? this book implying somehow friendship only obtained placating envy ( negative personal quality should dealt self-examination intent change , not pandering) ? it saying interesting unique qualities bad ? almost seems like it , least me . furthermore , there overtone " only belonging group you self-worth , " which hoary case balderdash ever i've seen . course , people who agree egregious sentiment disagree me , but won't make them right .

i searched high low via internet trying find perfect baby doll pram . good quality material , well made if possible fold away storage ability . when i found corolle pram /carriage i thought i found it plus added bonus adjustable handle so no matter how tall my grand daughter she could push her babies . but when it arrived i not thrilled . what looked good paper not so life . true it folds away store closet no problem . but this ability easy i fear child pinch her fingers . all keeps stroller up right position 2 lame flip over metal rings . now wonderful way simple umbrella stroller real baby folds way , why wasn't this technology used this product . sure adult would fold it up , but i would feel better if case then 4 year old maybe getting broken fingers . also cute canopy . it not stay if you even move it open tiny bit . i spent $113.00 this item thinking i getting well put together item would last years my grand daughter . only way happen if i weld parts together forget ever wanting store it . i not buy this amazon only cause i wanted it right away so bought it shop . but i knew amazon would this forum wanted make sure others not waste their money this product . go other one $33 least maybe it stay together . now i hope i return this thing where i bought it . but i think corolle should either rethink this items design or just pull it stores . it not what good parent would want their child . thanks i hoped this helped	-1

this toy not good all ! its hard reflecters stay still connect . its hard trace picture because you hardly see your hand ! plus it picture moves , thats it ! you start all over again . its better if you just take piece paper putting it over picture traceing it way , trust me i ended up just doing	-1
others said , this neat concept , but reality , it doesn't work great . after drawing it , you wet sponge erase it . think small child wetting sponge . it ends up dripping mess ! then they end up runny marker all over their hands , which ends up their clothes , etc . we're good watching kids , too . you really take control sponge make sure board wiped properly before kids use it . other thing none colors glowed very well kids stopped using it after only couple days . just very disappointing gift . fisher price should stuck original doodle pro ... my kids it year still use it	-1
my 15 month old daughter received this gift , i admit she loves it , but it nothing product design . she would love any toy shopping cart this stage . she just loves pretend cooking , eating , feeding her baby doll . this toy so shoddily made it laughable . some included foods put cart actually just cardboard boxes wind up torn garbage within first 48 hours . cart basket too small , baby gets stuck seat , my daughter gets frustrated when parts cart fall off she plays . it not going last long . best parts little milk carton banana . check out other shopping cart toys ( little tykes or small world toys ) . we bought her set wooden fruit ( melissa doug ) . when this shopping cart dies , we'll buy her sturdy one add more wooden food toys ( there some excellent sets available ) . my advice skip this one buy your child something better first time around	-1

since purchasing this " executive " set , i purchased one local store . although both sets relatively same , instruction package my second set much better . sea monkeys " executive " set lasted month half . this due fact instructions how care them very vague . we not know you needed add air water or over feeding extremely bad them . instructions sea monkey set we bought locally very good we now sea monkeys over 3 months . i believe " executive " set overpriced well	-1

i bought these skates my almost 3 yr old who wants like her big sister . skates good overall . they easy enough put take off . padding inside nice . only drawback i find adjustment lever keeps wheels rolling setting 1 changes itself setting 2 which lets wheels roll . i am not sure if i just got bad pair or if this happens all these kinds skates . i keep them but it get hassle keep putting them correct setting .	-1
we two new power wheels 12 volt batteries . they take charge just fine charger came them . i bought this so we could use it rapid charger it would take less time batteries charge . i plugged them waited few seconds . both batteries flashing red indicating batteries either wrong battery or bad . this not charge batteries me . all it sit there blink red . but batteries charge just fine original charger . how they bad batteries if they hold charge we get hours play out them full charge . funny . makes me wonder if it marketing ploy people run right out buy new $50 battery replace " bad " one . if it would actually work charge battery then it would great . but we cannot get past red light ours . it going right back store !!! it might slower but we stick our original charger now .	-1
my 4-yr old daughter really wanted this christmas , santa kind enough bring it her . quality fine , but it just doesn't much . she played it first day , touched it maybe twice since . i've seen these clearance everywhere i've gone lately , too . if your child into playing " mommy " , this cute , but extra money you pay something moves talks doesn't really equate lasting play value this one	-1
i also discouraged reviews but bought it anyway . it lot fun ! while it worked . we experienced same symptoms other reviewers here ... i appreciate info how fix it but should we ? it too bad because it really cute toy my 2 year old loved it . i would not buy it again . if you considering purchasing this toy make sure company fixed it first	-1

we've number gazillion bubble machines . first - this one , upright rotating set bubble wands - worked relatively well , but stopped working after maybe dozen uses . ( granted , one those uses few hours ) . when level liquid low , machine stops making bubbles since it pick up enough liquid cover wand . we replaced it next year typhoon machine - this awesome , produced huge quantity bubbles worked more reliably since bubble liquid sucked up put wands , no matter how low supply liquid . it large reservoir bottom so you don't need fill it very often - it takes lot liquid though . our issue now getting liquid . gazillion liquid produce best bubbles - they last well , etc . etc . etc . however , very few stores stock liquid , except when i first bought first machine , o-o ne stocks large size bottles . even online vendors like toys.com who supposed them , never them stock ( i've their notify list long time ! ) i've ended up buying someone canada ebay - otherwise , buying smaller bottles toysrus , target , etc . just too expensive . both these machines don't really work if you try other bubble liquids - other liquids ( especially cheaper kinds very large size bottles ) much thinner liquid drips right off wands before it chance pass blower part make any bubbles . we're planning start making our own bubble liquid hopefully cover us . otherwise , machines useless now .	-1
i hate monopoly , but loved idea making my own game board . sadly , myoo so many limitations ! i gave it higher ed rating because you turn game into educational one , but it isn't intrisically educational . it doesn't print out spaces color bars , just little green squares you glue board below pre-printed color bars . background everything you print school bathroom green . you stuck lotto squares board ( bad me since i believe gambling evil ) . you only twelve good/bad news cards . i liked making my own money , though . i figured out how most same stuff word . here how : i took board " your town " clone monopoly measured big squares . i think individual squares 2.5 3.5 , but it doesn't matter , since your board may different . word , i used legal-sized paper ( i think that a5 you brits ) made table nine columns that how many my board ) two rows . then i messed it get proportions correct . you fit three rows one sheet legal paper , if return really small , like 5 points . gives you space cut . get color bars , get your cursor top row . type any letter . then highlight it , go up " format " click borders shading . click shading , click color , then make sure it says " cell " not text or table . i use only 15 percent most colors . click ok you should color bar . type whatever text you want . then click below type your property name . printing , i found last squares outside printing range , so i only eight squares next time print separate sheet " railroad " squares . corner squares 2.5 inches my board . i would recommend you make them bigger , then trim size , so you won't any dead space your board . cut glue board you picked up thrift shop or yard sale painted or covered . property cards . these actually easier than i thought . make table one column wide two rows deep . make it fill whole page . color above , type whatever you want . when you print them out , print out 8 or 16 pages sheet get cards . chance community chest ... well , what i came up using mail merge shipping label template . you just print out regular card or paper , cut . data file used merge would your classy one-liners . i don't know putting graphics . also , i can't figure out how use merge . i it once but can't figure it out now . money i haven't able . i quarkxpress adobe pagemaker but don't know how use either program . plus , i wanted make money paint or something simple . hope these directions help someone	-1

great company - terrible toy . my daughter got this toy christmas waited all day daddy bring home 4 batteries which not included . she excited until we turned it . 1 ) frame not secure open when you reach into middle change picture disk . 2 ) light not very bright not work mid-day light . 3 ) image quite small - only takes up middle 3 inches paper - not even close what pictured box . 4 ) clamps hold paper not easy tiny fingers use . 5 ) because small picture middle page clamps far edges , you can't shift paper re-use paper . you get one tiny picture middle standard size piece paper its waste . chalk board fine - but whole piece slides across table when you push draw . big disappointment . get some washable markers some tracing paper don't waste your money this suprisingly junky toy	-1
one star rating this toy way charitable . car nothing but jerk , thats only when repeatedly hitting button . disney should shame themselves marketing this toy ! surely they idea their product poor performance . my advice everyone should print off reviews amazon all like it . this hand , march into disney stores demand ( 1 ) their money back ( 2 ) apology . only thing less reliable than this my 1991 gmc jimmy	-1

my 9-yr old received this toy birthday present . course it looks cool . against my better judgement immediately returning it , we opened , played 10 mins , got frustrated , now return it . boys very patient adusting straps properly their bodies ( it took 20 mins ) . seems like good quality wiring - i afraid they'd pull it while strapping , but it didn't . must stand 10 feet away each other ( good thing ! ) . punch/block sounds cool , but boys got very confused trying figure out who scored , what lights chestplate meant , etc . it possible you must go slow perhaps wait 1 player throw punch . then block . difficult excited boys so choreographed patient ! block opposite hand partner throwing punch hand while squeezing button palm strap your other hand . there some maneuvering get used . but within 10 minutes , all sound/power went down , we couldn't get it recharge/work again . it supposed recharge quickly so i don't know what problem . instructions say when nothing happens , change batteries ... but 10 mins into game ? hmmm . too frustrating all effort	-1

battery way overpriced . contact battery store near you ! i found this same exact battery type(2-6volt batteries ) much less . while there they told me i could use low amp 12v deep cycle battery instead . it take some time wiring ( fused link must ) but well worth it . lasts all day you charge it 2 amp " trickle charge " " amp selectable " car battery charger . all told it cost me less than $60 everything . it now longer just " takes up space "	-1

this product waste time ! don't bother . handheld game entertaining my daughter , but connecting it online via website frustrating say least ! once connected , we walked around " virtual world " nothing . it too complicated my 8 yr old alone . there much better products out there children similar , but easier play . i would suggest webkinz or neopets . these 2 sites very kid friendly educational games play , unlike muichiz site ! good luck ..	-1

my daughter wanted this christmas more than anything . but doll very difficult use . suzie these sudden shutdowns where she turns off no apparent reason . then suddenly she'll come back life later . she " grows " almost instantly . despite my best efforts try protect grow button . i reset her constantly . getting her all fun " big girl " things she suppossed frustrating my five year old . essentially , i spent more time fiddling suzie than my daughter spent playing her . face paint came off almost immediately . even small amount time she working . perhaps when my daugter little older , she spend time fiddling her . she play her just " baby doll " so it hasn't total waste . but i certainly didn't need spend extra money all electronics don't work . oh , sometimes i'll walk into my daughters room she'll suddenly " wake up " start saying mama . very horror movieish .	-1

if you planning getting good deck then not waste your time this .. it essentials , sure , but your money better spent one 4 " structure decks " !! they much better than this .. i say so beacuse my sis owns this deck i beat her every time :) konami needs put some better stuff this deck - like senju thousand hands 2 . also they need take away change heart since it " advanced " forbidden . but still , this deck deserves ok rating since it all essentials .. this no better than first yugi starter deck . so if you already starter deck , not get this it not worth it - lot weak non effect monsters .	-1

this cute idea , cute design , but ! it not realistic ! when you put your babydoll inside , it takes bit , esp . child get sling hanging around neck correctly turned right , then , poor baby doll falls , directly out it , no back support it , only way she stays if your hands never leave her ! so if price , which sale right now , lures you , i would suggest older child , rather than , say 3 , or so , my 3 year old , doesnt like it , her abilities , i dont like it either , but now , my 6 year old , she it , when she patient enough ! only 2 stars given , its cuteness price moment , otherwise too difficult unsupportive suit my girls :)	-1

truck gets clogged up often , it extremely difficult our kids load they almost always require adult load . tower decent , albeit , it doesn't quite work advertised well . our kids wound up just knocking down dominos old fashioned way . i grew up " domino rally " days compared original toys , these don't stack up . truck tower just aren't worth it , you better off buying bag dominoes letting your kids make their own domino trails	-1

i agree all other reviews this tent its durability , however my daughter absolutely loves it . first three plastic sticks come tent hold it open broke warped pretty quick . i went home depot bought three wooden dowels 79 cents each cut them correct length it works great . my daughter uses this mostly inside it fine , when outside wind everything else move it around . i bought 4 pack plastic tent stakes target $1 put one each corner hold it place , works great . i think we paid $19 this target it definitely seems worth amount enjoyment my daughter gets . if you expecting $200 high quality camping tent , you probably disappointed	-1
i bought quite few barbies amazon recently , including caligirl series , fashion fever series , barbie loves micky mouse . this barbie quite different all above . she not rubber skin like others , so we may see her leg joints if she wearing skirt or shorts . her foot quite flat ; only slippers this package fit her ; all other barbies ' shoes not . i guess this " pooh " might made " former generation " technology	-1
if 0 stars option , that what i would given this awful product . doesn't work anything like they show tv . so sticky , messy , slimy , smell just awful . i didn't even want my kids touch it because terrible chemical smell . i find it hard believe they label this product " non-toxic " . total false advertising . not buy this mess	-1
my 3-year-old son liked floam because goop factor , but unfortunately goop little foam pellets suspended seems great medium growing mold . this happened us twice ( despite clean hands/work space ) so we gave up it entirely . i suggest you try playfoam instead . it also available here amazon , or lakeshore learning store ( look samples checkout 49 cents ! ) playfoam nicer consistency , less sticky ( but still moldable ) no odor	-1

i got this my daughter who 10 feb . she wanted sewing machine very badly . this one made cheap plastic , no matter how many times we read instructions try close end , soon we remove it , it unravels . i think i'd spend more money get something better . my daughter says " it very irriating . "	-1
purchased 2 pairs my 8 9 year old daughters christmas . shoes made cheap pieces plastic . box includes bunches black , elastic bands you need really s-t-r-e-t-c-h onto shoes provide " bounce " . more your child weighs , more bands you use , but you double or triple them onto same hooks . they very hard install could dangerous if they snap back into your face while you installing them . once assembled , kids played them 10 minutes before becoming bored . they haven't played them since . don't waste your money	-1
oh my gosh-this terrible ! my husband i bought this game because i loved watching this child . this game uses same prizes games over over . if you played once you played too many times . games boring , prizes boring it waste money time . i don't know why box says " 13 up " because my 10 year old daughter could play this . this one going back store-i got zonked out my $24.99 ... if you want my opinion take cash run	-1

normally i am big fan little tikes name , but not so this product . i bought this my 2 1/2 year old daughter although concept cute , it not like other little tikes products . begin , train frequently comes off track . also activate it , you must press button where conductor goes . however , it difficult my daughter place figure this spot without it falling off . she often presses button process which activates train while she still trying put figure it which frustrates her . since this geared toddlers , you would think little tikes would put button activate motion different spot where figures go . also , age 2 1/2 she quickly bored it . she more fun letting it go floor across room than riding track . needless say , it going back . only good feature you " pack it go " away home fun	-1
don't waste your time this thing . time we invested toy , batteries , etc . we quite few dollars into it ... 15 minutes fun . toy can't just set down table , so when my son actually gone bored it ( my shock because he loves bubbles ) he tried set it down it spilled remaining gold solution all over . yuck . mommy promptly threw toy trash . this toy just gimmick - stick good old magic bubbles save your money	-1
idea behind this isn't too bad , my 4 year old really enjoyed them short time , but it some really ridiculous quirks . shoes not any type timer , so they stay indefinitely unless your child turns off each them individually . so what ends up happening , course , dead batteries within day or so . wand tiara both work fine , so maybe set wouldn't too bad , but it annoys me they would even release something ridiculous this	-1
i am very unhappy this product . handle hard turn , it takes too long clown pop up . when clown pop up it smells like forst fire inside toy . over all i would not recomend it	-1

this obviously re-release old " empire strikes back " kit released 80 . decent size kit ( approx 15 inches ) it gives experience modeler good opportunity super detailing . kit relatively easy build out box , but it many inaccuracies most notably inaccurate sensor/bridge deflector dome top ship . these inaccuracies addressed looking internet replacement parts articles addressing those inaccuracies . however , kit worth price . my only disappointment kit not scale new " republic star destroyer " " revenge sith " . new kit new movie over 19 inches long . order this kit scale current movie version , it would need 24 inches long . hopefully someone make " imperial star destroyer " scale .	-1

my husband i ignored many poor reviews choosing toys our 18-month old often pleasantly surprised see our son thoroughly enjoying such toys . unfortunately , this not case peg perego thomas ride-on train . he exceptionally tall strong his age , yet there no way his hand could possibly depress button required keep train moving , much less hold it down any length time . so operation train requires adult depress button spin circles while your child bats your hand away totally distracted experience . my son enjoys pushing train track more than riding it . however , train flimsy easily comes off track , so this usually lasts few seconds before he again frustrated annoyed . all this then you need get out screwdriver charge battery every time you " play " it . don't buy this toy or you kicking yourselves like we . it gimmicky piece plastic junk even major thomas-lovers probably not enjoy .	-1

my son ( now 4 ) loves cars , so when i saw this bed frame , i thought this it ! well , looks fool you . i also read many glowing reviews this bed frame , so i confident this must buy . but after using it while ( 1 year now ) , i am very disappointed . if i would buy bed frame , this one would not my shopping list . what i all my family don't like this frame : 1 . front end car frame shaped like sports car , so people hit protruding part all time when walking room , making people falter sometimes . 2 . since it made plastic , it gets really cold , it really feels terrible . i don't know why it damn cold all time . 3 . i exchange regular-height box spring half-height one , because regular-height box spring would too high sides bed frame would not provide adequate protection against falling . 4 . so many toys things fall mattress bed frame . i lift damn mattress then go into car frame pick up all junk my son loves shove into little openings . 5 . i think bed frame takes up way too much space twin sized bed . it waste space . 6 . my son disappointed wheels don't spin . i think he point , since this bed frame costs so much . my son now don't even think it cool thing . well , he stopped liking bed only after few days . 7 . head part bed also plastic , some reason , your head go under plastic , because head part comes over mattress . it quite annoying , we put pillow cover part frame . you can't even use it shelf since it not flat . dolls little toys we put up there would slide down hit our son or slide sides fall into corner where there big opening walls car frame . 8 . again , it very very cold , it really feels terrible when you want sleep night everything around you so cold hard . this miserable bed , i feel bad i bought this horrible bed my loving son . we gonna sell it 100 dollars ( we hope ) summer . only reason giving 2 stars because , it very solid	-1

i purchased this toy based excellent reviews it here amazon , it looked also like fun toy educational value . i am very disappointed . starters , my son finds it very frustrating front pieces eyes , face hat only go one order . he also trouble pulling pieces apart once they together , he very dextrous his age . also disappointing lack container store all pieces . without this , blocks loose my son toybox we never find all pieces . packaging could easily redesigned hold pieces . all all , it not toy he sit play without assistance , i thought it might . when he play it he enjoys it 15 minutes moves something else . we could without this toy under our christmas tree	-1

i consider myself fairly intelligent individual , growing up family where saturday spent working classic car garage , or watching football sunday , female , i know lot male stuff . even i couldn't answer hardly any " male " questions , since this game , men answer questions womanly stuff , women answer questions manly stuff . we played it twice now , even though men team always 1 male more touch his female side than most , women always gotten our butts kicked . it so one sided it not even funny . even men saying , it not even fun since game lasts basically 10 minutes . one men said he even think twice some " male " questions . if i anyone looking get good party game , i certainly wouldn't put my money out get this again .	-1

actually , we love game very much but very disappointed pressman toys . here scoop : our game came only 20 pegs each color -- box clearly shows least 40 each color . we've called company 1800 80 0-0 298 186 several times but they refuse send us additional pegs . just bad business practice my opinion . saying goes , when you love something you tell few people , when you're not happy you tell everyone . i'll sure check i'm not buying items pressman toys next time . so instead returning game paying shipping we'll just win fewer steps . sigh !	-1

3 stars overall only b/c we love c3 ! read ... batcave c3 set some rather intense structural integrity problems cause it next impossible put together without supplemental " fix-it " set distributed mfg . after many seasoned adults protested their frustrations its construction . since company now withdrawn all c3 items its website , it not known whether " fix-it " package still available ( it included thicker , stronger support pieces first floor , additional pieces stairway support column ) . without these , set tends implode well before you ever get 2nd level completed , let alone 3rd ! after all problems started surfacing , company also increased " recommended age range " 7+ previous 4+ . if you purchase box states 7+ age range , it should include " fix " parts ( no guarantee , we're only assuming ) , but even " fix " pieces , it still major headache put together , your true calling architect if you manage get it safely together first try . it takes most adults several tries over several days ( due frustration stress level ) get this piece fully assembled . there step-by-step construction guide showing problems ( " crash " pictures ) set construction , amazon rules say i can't post link here , but it shouldn't too hard find if you enter c3 batcave search engine , full write-up c3 forum . i know many people may still purchase -- it after all , batman , but i would least try see if you acquire replacement parts before ordering , you much greater chance success . or wait until you get package , if it says 7+ box , you just may luck . alternative , maybe you could use super-glue existing inadequate structural supports ? or , raid your kid lego stash use thicker , more stable blocks than ones supplied this set	-1

it seems just every house our subdivision electric ride-on toy . there few " barbie " jeeps , few polaris atvs , one corvette three gators few others . my 4 year old daughter first gator owner . i must say , it expensive .. this thing far most expensive toy my daughter , bar none . should you buy your 4 year old $300 ride-on toy ? well ... that up you . but she loves her gator . she give up lot other toys get this one , but she extremely happy it . sometimes i wish i 40lbs so i ride this thing . she can't care less " barbie " thing , so this green utility machine fine her . gator slightly faster than others fat tires truck bed makes gator looks lot more serious than barbie jeep . truck bed really useful . although not recommended , she hauled two kids bed . 4 kids car , it still zoomed around street quite well . one time i loaded nail gun , air compressor , electric drill jigsaw panel saw all bed asked my daughter drive other side yard fix fence . i saw our neighbor hauling few bags mulch theirs . it made such funnt scene .. little electric toys carrying real tools stuff . very cute . enough fun stuff . problem 1 . battery location hassle recharge this thing . you open front grill sometimes latch pinch your finger . it hurts . problem 2 . left front wheel fell off while my daughter driving it . i tightened it again never happened . problem 3 . slipping tires . people complain tires very low friction . they slip very easily driveway grass . but this how it " protects " its gearbox so i don't really care , but i heard they expensive once they wear out . i think this best ride-on toy market today . if extra $[ ... ] won't hurt you too much , then consider gator . your children not disappointed .	1

my daughters ( ages 5 2 1/2 ) given these dolls christmas . they love them play them every day , especially 5-year-old . i think littlest one may little too young really enjoy her fully , but she plays her when her big sister plays hers . i'm glad i didn't let some reviews discourage me getting these . all problems people limited english very easily remedied , if they read directions fully . first all , you must switch doll " display " mode , moving little switch her back . doll comes mode used so people try her out store . this mode , she only say one or two things english . one you move switch , you just " wake her up " hold button util she speaking english . point , she should speak english , even after waking up . however , if you turn her completely off via back switch , you switch her back english holding bracelet down . i really not problem , certainly don't spend time interpreting what she saying . that why they make directions - it tells display mode right front	1

we bought this toy our 1 year old son . it very sturdy well made blocks inside great . i agree other reviews wagon moves fast wood floors it not turn well . my biggest compaint , however , when both lids closed , wagon looks just like 2-step ladder . our son constantly tries climb it , like stairs . other day , he finally stood up top wagon wagon tipped straight over onto handle . my son fell over it crashed his face . there two rubber stoppers back wagon , but they not prevent it falling over . my son fine , but this toy very dangerous i not recommend it !	1

easy , straightforward interface ( instance , button each number ) navigation through cells . easy tell which numbers start puzzle which ones you entered . provides time-penalized hints any cell . pauseable saves your game ( aut o-o ff ) power sessions . most importantly , this device lets you make " pencil marks " ! i checked out least dozen products i yet come across electronic sudoku electronically lets me enter dots or xs indicate which numbers might ( not ) cell . it makes me wonder if people ordered design implement these games actually play sudoku themselves . closest i've seen let you enter multiple numbers cell it blinks through them , which i find cumbersome patience-trying . sadly , this thing doesn't electronic marks either , but their lower-cost solution involves dry-erase pen lets you make marks right screen , top little numbers printed each cell background . losing marks travel prevented recessed contours screen . why not 5 stars ? just fact marks aren't electronic , there no backlight , shadows cast dry-erase marks little disorienting . otherwise , well-done , fun , addictive product	-1

i bought this high chair my daughter second birthday because i love look it . similar chair made badger basket toys gets terrible reviews poorly constructed so i went this one despite it no reviews . i couldn't happier . this high chair solidly built easy assemble . i love white finish because it relatively neutral my daughter room may go through decorative changes coming years . i don't forsee her outgrowing this toy quite few years it sturdy enough last . she several dolls , largest her 17 " corolle lila , who fits beautifully chair . i would guess this chair could possibly handle up 20 " doll . while it solidly built , i am obviously discouraging my daughter sitting chair herself ( i've caught her trying several times ) because no doll chair should expected sturdy ! only real negative joke chair pad . i actually just tossed it because it doesn't really add toy play value anyway would probably just nuisance . i highly recommend this high chair child your life who enjoys taking care babies . it made me look kidkraft more toys doll furniture	1

developers this game great job coming up questions designed appeal kids , questions like : if you could star movie , which movie would you choose ? if you could eat only one food rest your life what would it ? questions range simple bit more complex , so kids who like challenges well those who don't enjoy game . thing : although you follow rules play this strictly board game , we used it while we just sitting around table casual chat . sometimes kids asked question , sometimes adults ... but we all learned more one ... lot more ... many questions got us talking family history , memories , etc . lots fun ! it'd great take questions trip or while eating restaurant since they surefire conversation starters but not so personal anyone " personal boundaries " invaded . plus , there no right or wrong answers any information provided strictly voluntary , revealing much or little respondent wants . one caveat : you eventually go through all questions so this game won't last forever ... unless you able find new people participate . if so , it used years . terms fostering family closeness without any threatening or off-limits questions ( short , everyone play nicely together ) this great !	1

this set one most fun builds i've lego long time . adult fan lego , i highly recommend this set its minifigures part selection . they excellent additions any castle or general builder . builder , final construction impressive size ( 18+ inches long ) , functionality ( rotisserie chicken quite amusing ) , playability ( sea serpent posability incredible catapult alone stunning ) . catapult my favorite part . after seeing necrotic firing action lego exo-force mobile defense tank disk launcher ; rapid-fire , long-range viking catapult astonishingly fun play . lone drawback this set fragility ship hull . it should assembled hard surface ( i tried build it carpet ) slid floor , not carried ( it fold half air ) . few extra plate elements reinforce hull joints would probably improve this set	-1
i bought this set my son prior reading other reviews online but before i tried set it up . i admit reading reviews how difficult some people thought it put together they must exaggerating ... we'll apparently they not . i tried 10 minutes covered soap nearly hurt myself trying get first two pieces together ... so point i gave up waited my husbands help . two us spent nearly hour banging thing together every tool we had(after we washed off all soap b/c just made getting pieces stay together impossible)and once we center base up i pushed it it fell completely apart . we got it back together but there no way i felt it sturdy enought let my child anywhere near it . so desperation i called toysrus store where i got it spoke w/ store manager . she assured me this not how it supposed i should bring it back . i wasnt thrilled b/c it wasnt easiest thing get home first place ... but what choice i . i asked her if they would set next one up me make sure it worked b/c i wasn't go through this again . when i arrived store it all set up completely sturdy ... exactly what i wanted it when i purchased it . unfortunatly due its size we take it back apart get it home but once we my husband it back together 10-15 minutes just little banging rubber mallett ... just like some other reviewers said . so morale story ... if its miserable put together then its probably defective should go back ... but once its together properly its great .... now if my son would just show some interest darn thing all would good world !	-1

sooo cute . santa gave my 7 y.o. daughter dog cat versions this game . she i already spent several hours playing her " pets " . unlike earlier pets , there more than just care your pet . there games , activities interactions pet friends . there whole village homes places visit . you collect stickers throughout your adventures . instance there 29 stickers available making friends . it represented heart sticker . everytime you collect sticker , you taken your sticker book it indicates how many stickers available how many you obtained . there three exterior buttons use play , groom feed your pet . when your pet ignores you , it means it time grooming , playing or eating . sometimes your pet suddenly disappear then reappear their potty mat left little undesirable . my daughter thinks hilarious . kids ! only drawback screen not light up play while travelling after dark . maybe they'll improve upon next versions	1

we bought our youngest son pirate ship seven years ago when he four . he now eleven , asking this new updated ship . he played old one years , outside pool , inside , big king castle , countless other sets we . yes , playmobil . delicate , young children taught how play it , there alot small pieces , but like lego , it encourage child imagination , rather than stifle it . we castles , western forts , city sets , boats , all it ! it take time put together , but some best memories me my boys putting together some these intricate playmobil sets day after christmas ! when you buy toys your kids , don't look toy say " what it " , rather look toy ask " what my child this toy " ? playmobil one toys my three boys stayed legos well past christmas , much more , than anything else . i am keeping all our collections our grandchildren .	1
there always problems any type bed , even inflatable one . i am actually 21 , but i don't credit card so i use kid review instead . this bed great . course there problems , but they don't outweigh good bed . it great sleep , you carry it trips , you it bed one place , or floor . i admit , it somewhat hard set up , but it worth effort , sleep unparralleled . i sleep it every night i no problems it all . i recomend this bed ages 5 adult because gap it side mattress . what most important thing all this : person you bought it happy it	-1

i bought this my children room which outer space theme . planets nicely look great . no , they don't glow dark all night long ... but who wants their kids room lit up all night anyways ?!?! they certainly glow long enough both my boys fall asleep ! we round ceiling light which i put triangular " rays " around which now our sun . i'm giving this 4 stars only because i agree sticker stars ... yeah ... they kinda stink . but , plastic glow-in-the-dark stars easy find ( i've even seen them pharmacy ) inexpensive . we put up 2 packages plastic ones added sticker stars package . it gives effect stars which closer farther away !!	-1
i just got laser tag master blaster few days ago i love it . i've my eye it ever since i got deluxe my b-day back september . i looking amazon so frequently price drop i got tired watching so i stopped few months . then spring came i got into playing laser tag again my little brother . i suddenly filled urge buy ltmb . i looked back amazon ... boom ! 60 percent off ! 20 bucks ! i told my mom dad it they said i could get one . so next day we began ordering process amazon , through toys us . we checked shipping charges ... bam ! 15 greens ! so we just figured our next trip into town we could just go toys us see if it would same price . it ( minus 15 bones sh ) . so we picked up few went home . after reading instructions million times doing few tests i finally figured out how they work . i also found out they very much like deluxe , except shoulder stock , sights , fully automatic feature , 3 shot burst , shot range , text messages , who could ever forget rocket . let me explain laser tag master blaster you : this large tagger much better very large playing field . deluxe irt-2x models better smaller areas . ltmb laser shot range up one thousand feet . laser three different shot types : single ( fire one shot ) , 3-burst ( fire burst 3 shots , no overheatage ) , fully automatic ( fire non-stop ) . you also send text messages ( up 10 characters long ) your teammates opponents . retreat ... behind you ... gotcha ... ouch ! rocket awesome . just load , pump , launch , simple . just twenty pumps rocket sail over forty feet , blasting everyone 15 20 foot radius . there lot more ltmb but it would take long type , so you'll just figure it out yourself .	1

most old skool fans angry he not vw beetle anymore . i kinda never liked beetles anyway , so im happy new unlicenced thing . it looks like mix mini peugeot . he transforms better than most , picture does'nt him justice , it makes him look stiff . actually , how bulky he , he amazingly bendable , i particularly like his " door/shields " are'nt attached his arm , their cuffling rotates so they wont too awkward like many others " door/shields " . jetski jetpack adds unneeded extra flair already awesome robo mode . extra retro touch it tempurture sensitive decal his chest/top car must held minute before it reveal autobot logo [ just like his original 80s version ] . i wish he come some sort weapon , but i few other transformers this same generation don't really need both they came . what even more awesome me i bought this grocery store , one very few toys they thier christmas section , $10 if your looking just any one good transformer , bumblebee good choice . if you optimus , this one looks great standing beside him . transformer fans don't delay , pick this one up ! i can't wait see movie camaro bumblebee july	1

even though i'm convinced all monitors work differently different locations , this model treated us well . we got this monitor ( dual receivers ) my first daughter 3 1/2 years ago it always clear crisp . reception perfect basement , frontyard , backyard ... even neighbor house . one receivers konked out after 2 years but we survived only one . second receiver finally stopped working last week after doing waaaaayyyy too much internet research , i decided go same , trusty , inexpensive monitor it works great ! i've never slept monitor our room ( because our babies stay us long time ) so i don't know nighttime quirks . i keep monitor our kitchen area listen little one waking up naps .... spy girls when they play upstairs without me . :) baby #3 way i'm sure this monitor last 3 years until we don't need it anymore . so , $40 over course 3 children isn't bad !	1

i agree denver reviwer totally out lunch . this doll greatly resembles my daughter friend jenny liu . jeeny born taiwan . chinese people don't look any one way expect them racist , like saying they all look alike . hair ornaments plastic but they look good . dress looks redder when you display her out box . fabric quality better than average mattel . her hair also much nicer more style than mattel giving us . i think this doll bodes well better things come this doll series .	1

this only figure apocalypse series dose not variant figure . kinda makes you wish it sentinel series , if you find them , most them variants you might actually want . i fortunate enough hit wal-mart time when shelves must just stocked , because racks full , all five variants right there front . needless say i bought all 5 . but maestro , far i know one appearance entire marvel universe , so what variant even possible . despite some protests this " hulk figure " this not some namby pamby rehashed hulk screaming action , fist pounding , slightly purplier pants we've seen dozen times before , but almost entirely all new figure . one reviewer said body based smart hulk figure , but i wasn't lucky enough snag one , so i don't basis comparrison . however , he well muscled , warty , weathered alot like he looks included issue captain marvel . if your wondering just what exactly him , fear not , captain marvel released series xv near end this year . then he go few rounds your maestro . now ml , where our legends 2099 spidey ? ( he also cm comic . ) he good figure , could little bigger , like more scale juggernaut series vi , but he come apocalypse piece whcich great figure itself	1
my one-year-old son great time playing these blocks ... he loved colors shapes . he really enjoyed knocking down my block creations . we such good time playing blocks i decided go on-line buy him some . i shocked price . i cannot believe [ what ] these blocks cost ... thirty-two foam blocks ?!?!?!?! forget it . it too bad these blocks cost restrictive ; they're great fun , but not worth price	-1
this one most fun games i've every played . there tons belly laughs people try bluff their way through answer question . i find questions ( answers ) quite educational too , i've learned lot these questions . group family members played christmas ( 6 us ) it hilarious watch some people try come up answer question ( bluff ) . we even let our 5 year old nephew " play " he pretty good coming up some bluffs . try it , it loads fun . i recommend group least 4 though	1
i've consistently impressed bionicle toys lego , rahkshi no exception . wish i young enough actually play this stuff . sigh . anyway , rahkshi take bionicle can-sold figures new new level articulation . total , joints found neck , shoulder , wrist , hip , knee , ankle , crank back swivels entire arm assembly side side so you whack things staff-like weapon each rahkshi weilds . then there opening case back so you flip spooky little rubber leech/slug things through air . each one these things appears come miniature cd full quicktime promotional stuff toys , game , web site , etc . voice bit melodramatic , but it still kind neat . i like 360-degree rotating model toy you just bought ... sort redundant , since you look one real life , but nifty all same . one thing mildly disappointed me rahkshi weapon isn't really independanly existing object - which say bar held " hands " only attached hands , not heads weapon . this isn't really big deal , except it means you can't figure hold weapon only one hand . this could rectified 2 small technic pieces , course , but it mean you'd add extra bits set somewhere else . overall , very cool build-it-yourself action figure could either set stand looming your monitor work , or actually played . educational value limited following instructions demonstration structural principles , any lego set . durability seems good so far - lego pretty sturdy stuff	-1

i understand people who install car seats who feel this item isn't needed distrust its lack crash testing , but my infant car seats hand-me-downs without latch . my car latch , but not seem kind seat belts stay tight . my car seat doesn't just get little loose ... you move it 4 or 5 inches side side if you try . it may car seat tech could train me better job locking clip , but i can't get it stop this . one seats given me without locking clip all . i no problem tightening seat belt enough - it just won't stay way . this product allows me tighten car seat enough meet " one inch " spec . nothing else . so it definitely adds my baby safety . finally- car seat techs- number these sold , it doesn't appear anyone come forward say it failed crash . just because it hasn't crash-tested not mean it unsafe . there absolutely nothing wrong aftermarket goods rule , tho manufacturers always tell you otherwise	1

i infant in-home daycare needed quad stoller my four babies . when i first found these connectors , no one could tell me if they would connect two tandem double strollers together . i asked every store town almost ( some didn't even know what they ! ) . i just decided buy them hoped they would work . so i went out bought two kolcraft lil ' limo strollers , not knowing , course , if it would work or not . i'm happy say they seem work really well ! i buy second set , though , so i five connectors mine(couldn't find room sixth one ) . just lock two inner front wheels so they can't turn you're off ! it little hard turn corners(just take them wide angle ) , but otherwise it works great ! i ended up spending just under [ price ] total cost it , much less buying actual quad stroller . i hope this info helpful someone else also . good luck	1
i played " atmosfear , harbingers " vhs mid-90s several years later bought copy game through ebay . then , i saw this dvd update gave temptation when price marked down . here my judgement : 1 ) mechanics simplified . this it pros cons . it could made easier learn without removing many components . 2 ) gatekeeper less nasty/funny balance dvd update . 3 ) it major upswing his dialogue randomly disbursed . one reviewer seemed think game boring . i'll guess , instead , people he parties don't attention span board games . too bad them . atmosfear - dvd board game get b+ me	-1
this toy wonderful several reasons . one thing , it really only shape sorter your child ever need . it very basic shape sorting ( cut out holes sides one door opened any shape block go ) , plus pretty complex shape sorting when you open various locks . toy also helps teach colors animals , locks develop fine motor skills even further . overall , this toy very well made . it real wood , dove tailed together . it could , course , fall over , but if your child 18 months or older recommended this toy , he or she probably isn't small enough it hurt . locks this toy little more chintzy . they wobble , which makes locking or unlocking some them more difficult ... but you could look this just learning tool . my biggest concern blocks relatively small ; they could squeeze through toilet paper tube . this means they potential choking hazard , so you'll want supervise when your child uses this toy . all said , my 20 month old loves this toy plays it more than anything else she	-1

this game great way pass twenty thirty minutes . it very easy learn not any pieces lose , or money count . strategies , however , numerous , there equal amount luck skill involved good gameplay . i really liked how game could only played two people , i tired games could played two , but which really meant enjoyed three or more ... game contents : 1 deck game cards , one small board . note : if you want make this game really portable you don't even need bring board . it just place put discarded cards way help organize your cards . long you pencil paper scoring end game , you play it everywhere you table . ( i figure you need much space lay down your cards size typical monopoly board ) . playing note : one thing initially little confusing us when we reading instructions , instructions not explain you place your cards opposite side board your opponent . you each play all 5 expeditions , head head manner . we sitting couch coffee table , we turned board horizontally face us ( instead vertically ) instructions confusing until we moved board 90 degrees . game designers assumed you would play game one would play game checkers , sitting across one , but you don't actually play this way , even though you need turn your board same effec t.t his game really fun i would highly recommend other games same manufacturer ( rio grande games ) . they really knack publishing great strategy games . they even release expansion sets their popular games , they credit players who gave them ideas expansion cards . pretty neat	1

i bought this game two weekends ago both fun frustration it . i'm freecell junkie gone so far download better version ( more games ) than one came my computer . i lost track how many total games i've played over years since i've used several computers , but i play 10 games day average . i'm very competitive love keeping track my stats . unfortunately , weakness this version game . example , if you get into position you move only one card back forth two columns there no other moves , all you hit replay button or move game . if you hit replay button you don't get loss recorded , which course you should . consequently , it easy run up high win percentage this version game just resigning game when you think you going loose replay it . then when you finally win , you get credit win . course , not proper scoring either . also , there key combination when you lose game outright want replay , you don't get any further losses counted against you . that it should . only problem key combination very flaky doesn't always work . other than scoring inconsistencies , it great game ! it very easy use . although different use than playing mouse your computer , if you've played lot your computer you'll pick up operation this version almost immediately . display large easy see , there low light level sensor front automatically light screen when you playing area poor lighting . great feature . i love playing this game while sitting airport waiting board plane plane itself while air . it great challenging way pass time away if you like playing solitaire . next version this game , i hope they beef up statistics capabilities unit	-1
this christmas gift , person loved it . i so happy i chose this website purchase !!	1
after three years dragons who walk all fours , we get dragon who stands upright . seems kind strange . thoron debut appearance " fire ice " portal fire set . he makes appearance here metal ages , he looks lot meaner here . perhaps rigors battle wearing him . i bought stendhal first very pleased him . i found thoron somewhat disappointing . he got some great detail , but he not articulated stendhal . replacing standard light-up feature dragon roar feature . thoron doesn't light up , but he variety growls roars activated button his chest . his articulation pretty decent . his hind legs ( which he stands ) stiff only move back forth . but it gets much better when we examine his arms head . his arms move back forth , away his body . shoulder joint move two directions . we get two additional points articulation elbows wrists . thoron wrists aren't versatile stendhal ( stendhal wrists turn addition claw moving back forth ) . his neck move left right , his head move all manner directions . always , his jaw opens . his tail flexible super-posability , his towering wings . he also turn waist . my complaints thoron articulation twofold . it would've nicer if his hind legs posable , it definitely would've nice if his wrists articulated like stendhal . thoron mostly dark green white highlights his wings , white claws his feet , silver colored armor . mentioned , detail here better than ever , everything realistic look . he comes removable piece armor his head . i think he looks better without it , but maybe that just me . thoron one most charismatic dragons i've seen ( it all face eyes ) . he looks kind mean vicious . stendhal supposed bad guy , he doesn't look this mean . original thoron fire ice series better facial expression . this action figure comes almost completely assembled . i just attach his wings . also included some parts building small tower decorative blades flag , draigar warrior shield weapon . all things considered , thoron isn't quite nice stendhal . nevertheless , he gets thumbs up me . he good addition any dragons collection fun action figure play around	1

this first rc ( radio control ) aircraft i ever flown , although i raced rc cars quite awhile . it comes fully assembled nice manual even quick intro dvd get you air quickly . i started out my living room it worked just great . just little trimming out heli very stable easy which get feel . i've run it few hours now no incidents i'm getting pretty good hovering although i still tough time head-in flight ( controls thus reversed ) . blade cx rtf makes great first heli or just great indoor heli . probably fine anyone over 10 years old . i am getting 10-15 minutes flight time battery charge . only disappointment charging battery takes 60-90 minutes ( typical all lipo batteries ) . i'd recommend getting extra battery or two maybe even extra powersupply charger . also i tried training gear add-on blade cp/cp pro -- it fits cx just fine allows you use it later if you move -- it helps damage but makes blade cx slightly less stable hover my opinion but not terribly so . they're probably worth trade off first . few more hours i think i'll ready move up blade cp pro . highly recommended anyone interested entering rc helicopters or who just wants heli fly around house . two good sites further info [ ... ]	1

my 4 1/2 year old recieved this red engine last christmas , first couple months used practically every day . ( yes , i agree rest reviewers- buy rechargable batteries since this engine eats them , prepare disappointed since it cannot pull many cars up hills without getting stuck . ) i tell you i cannot believe my son not touched this engine since . his complaint all it go around around . instead , he enjoys playing out stories thomas , or making up his own train sagas . my husband likes watch engine more than my son . i don't know how other children play their trains , but battery operated engines just cannot hold his attention very long . nevertheless , first few months , watching it really mesmerizing , i could watch it hours . perhaps instead buying this one engine , purchase setup more cars track same money . it probably get more use end	-1

i love melissa doug toys , they're always well-made always thoughtful . they encourage learning their pieces , made natural material , not only hold up well but environmentally friendly . this game particularly nice example . it classic wooden puzzle twist . each vehicle puzzle piece magnet it players yank them out magnetic " tow truck " . melissa doug made two other puzzles similar this , fish puzzle butterfly puzzle , same concept . this one , however , might appeal more kids whose current fascinations lie more lines cars trucks . one our pieces ( fishing version this puzzle ) stick , but quick rub around edges some sandpaper loosened it right up . downside using real materials wood tendency warp humidity or dryness . that downside i'm willing live ! excellent toy !	1

our 19 month old enjoys playing this purse . she enjoys purse itself , cell phone , lipstick most . mirror , keys , wallet , credit card aren't played much . only complaint i she unable open wallet her own . trying open wallet frustrates her no end--it hard young toddler dexterity open such thing	-1
i don't know why some reviewers complaining size this-just read description . we bought this my 8 month old she loves it . it first toy she goes every morning . it perfect size her she loves opening closing all doors . i think it makes ideal first kitchen	-1
i agree other reviewer this more like shape sorter than kitchen . my daughter loved it when she 1 . now she turned 2 she lost interest it , like many other " baby toys " . i get her larger more realistic toy kitchen so she " cook " it	1
if you interested this kitchen because you would like expose your children new languages , i would keep looking . my goal expose my daughter french , but quality voice so poor i barely understand what said english ! quality construction fine but , frankly , you're paying added bonus languages it simply isn't worth it . i would recommend looking regular kitchen , whose design you like , finding way introduce language	-1
we bought this kitchen set our daughter christmas . thinking since it little tike it would best buy would stand up young child . i bought little tike before . but i'm not sure i again . refrigerator door doesn't even come close fitting . oven door warped one side doesn't close . it repeats same phrases over over . tape shipping left ink doors . we very disappointed whole kitchen set	-1
inexpensive much better protection than dad old shirt . heavy clear/printed vinyl . concerns fit listed ratings not hold true . purchased use pre-k class apron lots growing room could likely used several more years . nice velcro closures make apron easy child teacher .	1
my son loves episode ii clone troopers ( especially ones animated ' clone wars ' i ii series . when he saw this , there no question he it ! " hunt grievous " clone trooper 5-pack , this his favorite amongst all star wars action figures vehicles . only draw back rear turret which bends when you set it flat surface repelling hooks back , which long strings seem afterthought design	1
this fun family game . it educational good way kids learn value dollar . it , however , million pieces you could easily lose - which nightmare mom dad ! however , this remains one my kids favorite games even my 12 year old	-1
i bought this my 8 11 year old girls extre inexpensive christmas gift , i pleasently surprised how much they enjoy it	-1
our son received this gift , we sent it back . box made inferior wood , very poorly constructed . not really " constructed " all - rather just glued together , not well , . two corners coming apart . also , lid opens two parts . drawback : when you open or close either side , plastic trays inside hold crayons pastels , fall out , there nothing securing them box . so , you try hold tray place while closing either side . we can't comment supplies themselves , we not allow our son try them , or else he would not able return item .	-1
most would say battleships game luck , yet someone known me proved there some very sneaky tactics ( without cheating ) you employ see you win . kind ruins fun , but classic game nonetheles	-1
sorry now-classic game derivative pachisi , one oldest known board games . players simply trying get all their pieces their starting place end . it not simple , though , other players kick you back your start ( sorry ! ) their own maneuvering get their end . this game clearly withstood test time favorite your house many years come	1
i've played this game since i teeny kid it still ton fun . most games , there small pieces involved very well may end up someplace where they're not supposed , plus you can't really afford lose any pieces . plastic bag ' em	-1
monopoly game where you buy properties mortgaged owners , you must buy them **** load money . it absolutely best board game series ever made . there tons special editions monopoly , example : spongebobsimpsonsfamily guythis product must buy . buy it now	-1
my five year-old daugther wanted this barbie computer christmas after receiving younger barbie computer her 3rd birthday . she not get it because it seemed expsensive but bought it herself her christmas money . she loved it start . she likes games spanish it , too . she loved mouse first but then realized it doesn't travel well ones without mouse ( needs solid surface versus using it car , airplane , drs office ) . screen could larger course . she finds some games challenge figure out rules how-tos but overall loves her computer . she very pleased her purchase i think she playing it couple years . games good ages 5-8 range	-1
unless this product undergone some major renovations , i would think twice buying it . here what i think last year model ... we got two barbie b-books our daughters christmas last year they quite disappointing . after thirty minutes failed attempts christmas morning , our girls put them away hardly played them since . toy rated 5-8 age range , but both my daughters ( ages 5 7 ) trouble them . i didn't expect world $50 , but it certainly should better than this ! display screen tiny dark gray text light gray background very hard see , you get angle exactly right . graphics choppy look like they came program designed early 80 - all blocky angular . sound system low grade fuzzy , making it extremely difficult understand barbie instructions . it impossible tell difference when she says " " " " or " " " " . since screens so small , text scrolls across rather than displayed all once . even my seven-year-old ( who great reader ) trouble keeping up scrolling text , my kindergartner , forget it ! games poorly explained too difficult this age range . even basic spelling games ridiculous because level difficulty jumps all over place . level one , i asked spell car , map , tar , then suddenly cruise caravan ! nonsense programming like this caused my daughters much frustration worse , made them doubt their own intelligence . we don't even turn b-books anymore . my girls able get little use out them when they play office , pretending they're laptop computers . all , these expensive disappointment not worth money	-1
i bought this set my niece nephew they absolutely love it . colors great case makes it cinch store away . this set provides them hours fun . i recommend this everyone	1
my twin daughters got one these kitchens christmas ! they love this kitchen . it not tall some others market which feature i love !! my girls play this all time it small enough i it set up kitchen so they pretend they cooking while i make dinner . i would recommend this anyone looking kitchen toddler . it well built stays clean	-1
i purchased this item my 2 year old toddler . she loves playing kitchen while i prepare meals . she able manipulate open all compartments ease . this great buy	1
my one year olds twins received this christmas discover sounds kitchen . my daughter sticks her hand down ball drop hole pick up ball instead getting ball side pocket . once she ball her hand , she cannot get her hand back out hasn't figured out drop ball . this happened three different times . once , she walked off dragging workshop behind her until i caught up her . she not injured , but very upset . i sit right next her when she playing workshop , or put it up . my twins use discover sounds kitchen more often we not any problems it .	1
we discover sounds kitchen ( which great ) so i decided try this toy . it not nearly interesting kitchen but girls enjoy ball drop nails . i think it decent toy price , but i wish it more interesting parts it .	-1
my kids ( 6 , 5 3 ) all love this puzzle . we all enjoy art work letters different than normal examples ( yarn , nuts ) . my daughter just leaves this puzzle out her shelf because she likes look it . my 6 year old still likes it because it not babyish most alphabet puzzles . we this puzzle 5 years no problems wear tear issues	1
my now 2 year old began playing this puzzle ( which handed down his old brother ) when he 12 months old . time he 15 months old , he knew all his letters !	1
this game comes out first family holiday gatherings . it easily modified younger age group gets them thinking ways other than usual children game . my 4 6 year old grandchildren love it i recently purchased it my daughter-in-law birthday gift . however , timer not well constructed it broke very soon after purchase both my game others i purchased friends . it hard game find but amazon come through more than one occassion	1

wow ! my kids(8yo 5yo)love play this game ~ they really enjoy this version go fish ~ we all enjoying thrill recognition when we see these artist works other places ~ well worth money	1
tattoos really nice , but ink part ( markers ) wash off easily . black tattoo outline seems last several days	-1
i lot research internet regarding play food before i bought this set . this set offers largest variety foods , covering all food groups , minimal amount desserts ( i want healthy eater ) . this play food set eggplant , cauliflower , asparagus , chicken , steak , ham , hot dogs , hamburger , bacon , pineapple , lemon , honeydew musk melons , any many more items - incredible selection foods . i received exactly what shown picture internet . food very high quality just right size play kitchen fit play plates . my daughter , husband i great time this food . she loves making us breakfast , lunch , dinner , snacks . she also likes put it her shopping cart we purchased separately ring food up pretend cash register . comments packaging ... packaging costs money which built into cost food . why this food doesn't cost lot , because step 2 saves money packaging . plus most people toss packaging anyways after opening item . packaging clear plastic so you see all items . this set larger variety food than little tikes , fisher price , just like home ( i never saw anything kid connection play food during my research ) . person who received 8 hot dogs , 12 french fries , etc . should contact step 2 ask reship . there must mistake made when packaging ( probably rush holidays orders ) . you should get exactly what shown internet . i hope this review helps everyone . fun this food ! it great buy !!	1
if you looking play food like little tikes or fisher price , this not it !! there reason you get 101 pieces 19.99 !! these pieces much smaller made thinner cheaper plastic . not all what i expected quality company like step 2 . top it off , this set not come retail box but cheaply packaged plastic bags . i am sure my daughter doesn't mind these cheaply made or small but i sure heck . i could bought kidconnection set walmart less money maybe even better quality	-1
i bought this my 2 year old . i happy it wasn't huge -- fits right corner . she loved it when she first got it christmas . however , my complaints ... everything just so small inefficient ! " microwave " so high she can't even reach it small stool i bought her use just kitchen ! back little bins open , you can't store anything there . so , i don't know where they came up lots storage line ! i just expected little bit more kitchen -- would changed some features . overall it proven fun toy , but hard use unless you really tall	-1
i bought this my 19 month old daughter christmas she loves it . she seems little young i skeptical but she older siblings who enjoy it her . she just tad too short open microwave easily but it won't take long until non issue . stove button easy work she loves cooking noises , which not annoying like so many other toy noises . i know i trust it last since it little tyke . it great those us who don't much extra space it takes up almost none yet plenty things play . it also great it comes few items start out	1
my son 4th birthday tomorrow , sept . 17 , he said he really wanted kitchen . i wanted get him more expensive step 2 one but he insisted he liked this one best . ( i think he loved idea real towel ) i just finished putting it together which very easy but getting oven fridge doors little annoying they don't close completely u push little get them closed so i don't know if frustrate my son ..... we'll see . directions it tells u dab little dish detergent oven knob make pushing it easier , well i saved this part last use all my might get knob ! i don't understand why they can't just attatch little knob when they making these but oh well . my son using this tomorrow i'll get back update ! i would also recommend u putting it together before your child knows u got it them	-1
parents find songs really annoying !! :) my baby thinks this greatest toy ever ! he 10 months old these two months so far . he loves taking pots out putting them back getting them play music , over over over over .... we put it away every once while so it doesn't drive us crazy , but baby , it great !	-1
my son loved learning table so i really thought pots pans would big hit when i purchased them when my son 8 mo old . i could not get product say anything but , " red pan , red pan out " . i called hotline fisher price they told me change battery which i already . while i phone , my son dropped pot it began sing alphabet song . cust . service rep. told me pots said sang things random it reponds when manipulated like child would . i disapointed because toy responds very randomly usually only sings if it shaken very hard or dropped . i really feel i wasted my money this one	-1
i've got this thing my twins ne = ew year , they've enjoying it one day so far . we two sets , it much more fun than just one - going one shooter against two robots indeed deathwish . i don't know how durable it prove - robots suffered some tumbles without ill effects , but it only one day . one drawback i found toy inability go shooter shooter - some reasons pistols , when set team team , refuse shoot one . but it fun toy nevertheless . only educational value i discern this set little bit understanding just how stupid computers , may realization light " bullet " gets reflected off white surfaces , so robot canshoot you even when its back turned toward you . otherwise , not eductaional all . thankfully :)	-1
i bought this item my 3 year old daughter same problem chalkboard ( not working so well ) . i call 800 number back box people customer service sent me new chalkboard . i amazed how helpful they desire they make me happy . i buy melissa doug toys years come .	1

most ride toys very wide , which make pushing little hard . this toy thin ; therefore , my 2 yr old son loves it more than any other push toy . this so so cute , i wish there more stickers , but who cares , it worth buy ! i hated paying 8-9 dollar shipping , but motorcycles this cute hard find ... this light easy throw truck take	1

entire play tent idea great idea . however , it need little more attention velcro snaps attach tunnels tents together into one unit . it isn't durable enough price . i it out day , my daughter didn't last it . she prefers schoolbus instead . i see this toy breaking down tears very quickly because it little fragile	-1
we got this our son month ago . he almost 14 months now , younger than recommended age 3 years , but he never unsupervised when using playhut . our son loves play hide seek ( hiding us , course :)) inside playhut , or just going retrieving balls we toss there him . he doesn't exactly know what basketball hoop yet , but i'm sure come . he lost his balance while playhut knocked it down , but it pops right back up . , since we it up against wall , it more stable anyway . enjoy	1

i am now college- studding teacher . i however got orriginal " baby born " doll when i one . it my first doll ever i still her . i named her molly when i three would carry her every where . i course orriginal didnt much todays baby born- mine not cry , make noises , go potty but i imagination my eyes she real . ( i watched " little princess " believed all dolls alive ) but baby born me more than doll . i recamend baby born all little girls- women who said baby born ugly- well i dont know other adults but adults my parents knew thought my doll real baby- until they would see me spin her they would heart attact then realize its doll ... they all thought life like adorable . i love baby born i am now going buy one my cousin jordan her first real baby doll .	1
i purchased this kitchen last christmas my girls . when it arrived , both my husband i amazed quality . assembly instructions(although it takes few hours ) very clear all parts pieces color coded numbered . i consider this piece " furniture quality . " top it off , it absolutely adorable my girls ( 2 4 ) love play it . it definitely type piece passed down generation generation . if you considering purchasing some kitchen sets pricier mall/catalog stores ( you know which ones i am talking ) , consider this first .	1
we bought this our girls ( 4 2 yrs ) last christmas so we last year model so i vouch how well this held up . they still love it play it daily . great wooden design sturdy construction , but let me tell you this no small undertaking assemble ; it easy but time consuming . if i only could paid santa assemble ! other than , compared other wooden kitchens , it great product this price point much better quality than plastic ones make noises etc . it larger reality kids use their imagination don't need all other stuff . my girls cook , bang , open doors shove stuff it it takes it like champ ! only drawback primarily made feminine colors so if you little man loves cook target now carries great little wooden kitchen blue stainless steel look it plus they carry great wooden food accessories .	1
i just purchased this game my 3-1/2 year daughter . she dora fan , so she wanted play it immediately . she sat there played entire game one sitting . basically , dora boots adventure help find pieces tico aircraft . swiper makes his regular appearances well . i help her understand how something couple places , but otherwise it right her level . she knows her numbers colors she very excited she able progress . best part game , my opinion , your little one able make jumps without any problem . pooh game her other favorite ( great game ) , but she needs help making some jumps . dora game , dora won't fall if you keep walking when you supposed jump - she just leans over his tippie toes like she going fall . my daughter especially proud fact she able jump swinging vines . i highly recommend this game !	1
i waiting this game come out my daughter reward potty training . my daughter just turned 3 this game very easy her navigate , previous poster stated some other v-smile games hard control . graphics characters voices if your watching cartoon dora . this game also very educational teaching spanish english colors numbers . also they teach animal sounds recognition animals ( both underwater farm animals ) . today first day we it so i'm sure i'm missing lot this review , but this game far best v-smile game them all we all v-smile games ( we keep up date when new games come out ) .	1
we bought this kitchen my 3 yr old son christmas . after searching through other kitchens we decided this one many reasons . first we liked it not huge overbearing , minimal sounds electronic functions there still plenty room using his imagination which important us . both burners light up , one makes " frying " sound , other " boiling " sound . it compact enough move around easily , we like keep it kitchen well living room outside nice days . secondly we liked chicco got it right regards usually discriminating gender biased kitchen sets pinks purples . subdued primary colors used chicco kitchen making it appealing both genders . lastly price this kitchen bargain compared others out there , especially since we not sure how much my son would really use it . although my son played it company child ease , i would reccomend getting something bigger if you two children constantly playing kitchen it rather small or conjunction other kitchen items placed near it like microwave or coffee pot , so focus not just one item given time	1
my one year old son loves play toy kitchens whenever he sees one , but i not want pay big $$ toy kitchen . i am so glad i found this one . he 13 months old it perfect him . very inexpensive but very cute fun . he not yet walking , so i just put it up against wall . so far , it not tipped over once . it perfect kitchen him . he already pretends cook eat play food included . my husband also liked fact it not girlie any way	1
i ordered this particular bunco set because company description said it pink ! i received very ugly cream red set .	-1
previous reviewer complained this games simplicity , he obviously never attended bunco party ! this awesome game play group friends , it easy , allows conversation , become craze across usa !!! there countless bunco party going each week which allow moms i am sure some dads night out friends neighbors little fun . this kit great everything you'll need host bunco party ! get wine chilling appetizers ready fun party you your friends never forget !!!	1
brought this item my grandaughter , she totaly enjoyed it . it appears well made , should last long time . i believe it very educational she pretends veternarian	-1
very interesting spoof original game . i found first one boring after few plays , but this one still interests my kids i after 10+ plays . it bit convoluted put it together initially , but well worth it	-1
this extremely fun addictive game . you shuffle cards , place three ( room , weapon , person ) secret envelope . every room you go into , you make accusations . if someone card you accused ( like room ) , then they show it you you write it down your notepad . game changes constantly , so it never gets boring . character pieces teeny details , like mr. green straps buckles his briefcase . i gave it 4 stars education because it teaches you focus really think . oh , good problem-solving skills too . coordination ( you add all clues up see who it ) . all all , terrific game . great rainy days or playdates . i mention weapons ? very realistic . cute	-1
i bought this game long time ago but unfortunately all my friends busy until x'mas . there 5 us once we started playing , we all addicted ! i heard some other friends commented clue boring game , but we all found it fun challenging ! apart strict logic thinking , keys win ask right question make good , well organised notes ! last time we played we 5 players , so some us got 4 cards hand some got only 3 hands . bit unfair because players 4 cards more clues beginning so their chances winning higher . so we tried one game open 3 cards table , game finished lot more quickly . but we all found it less challenging . overall , great game !! train you brain logic thinking much sudoku mastermind	1
child , i myself grew up candyland . now i children my own , my house wouldn't same without it . we got this game when my son 3 my daughter 2 . both kids understand concept game enjoy playing i t.t he best thing this game there nothing really complicated . kids don't even know their colors play . they just need match up color card color board . game simple enough kids often win which makes game more enjoyable them	1
i purchased this kitchen three weeks ago my grandchildren . instructions great assembly . lots storage space all kitchen food , dishes small appliances . i it set up my kitchen it fits well my decor . it all " bells whistles " , my 4 year old granddaughter 18 month old grandson really seem enjoying . it takes up good size spot my kitchen but it totally worth it see children fun it	1
i eyeing this kitchen two christmas ' . we knew this year we definitely going purchase kitchen set our 4 y/o , 2 y/o , 10 month old . it just matter finding one durable , fun stuff , options fun all three kids . we wanted something big enough two kids play , something would grow our family . this kitchen definitely met all my expectations . we purchased this directly manufacturer they offering free shipping until end last year . i took advice other reviewers made sure put stickers first . step 2 website great video demonstration putting this together . electric screwdriver nice , but there some tricky angles might require regular one . i would definitely expect spend least hour putting it together . but just think , you only put it together once . i it alone , but it would helpful extra set hands . kids love this kitchen . our 10 mo . old isn't old enough truly understand cooking , but she loves open close cabinets oven , pull drawers out , put things out sink . our 2 y/o more imagination enjoy actually pretend cooking . he understands it loves all space available . our 4 y/o isn't really " cooker " , but he plays this too . i like all storage space this kitchen provides . doors cabinets aren't all sturdy , but they get job . they definitely aren't quality countertops or main structure . there sounds microwave , dishwasher , oven , phone , stove . said , first three mentioned basically same " sound maker " , just different sounds coming out . stove neat , especially clear pots . i'm sure there many other kitchens out there more " wow " factor far " lights sounds " . i am definitely pleased this kitchen , it worth wait . it take up some space , but nothing i didn't measure out before we decided purchase it .	1

i thought this would toy my daughter would grow into not excited first . this first toy she opened christmas only 19 months not interested any others rest week ! she enjoyed collecting fingers " counting " them . she also grown last few months putting puzzle together herself although fingers might not make it correct hand just yet . very durable , love it traditional wood toy doesn't flashing lights or needs batteries ! she still loves it months later . only downside any toy like this , we collect pieces after she put them various places around house .	1
little hands well two hands this puzzle . bright , colorful art images thrilled my children . it well made sturdy . my children think this " big kids " puzzle since it isn't farm or baby animals . it makes them proud when they put it together	1

this very ! cute set all littlest pet shop playsets hot right now . but toys us this exact same item only $29.99 right now . if you want buy this toy save some money , buy this set toys us . just some friendly advice . happy shopping everyone !!!	1
very interesting spoof original game . i found first one boring after few plays , but this one still interests my kids i after 10+ plays . it bit convoluted put it together initially , but well worth it	-1
this little difficult figure out beginning - actually read instructions - but it very fun very disney . fam loves it	-1
if you interested this kitchen because you would like expose your children new languages , i would keep looking . my goal expose my daughter french , but quality voice so poor i barely understand what said english ! quality construction fine but , frankly , you're paying added bonus languages it simply isn't worth it . i would recommend looking regular kitchen , whose design you like , finding way introduce language	-1
we bought this kitchen set our daughter christmas . thinking since it little tike it would best buy would stand up young child . i bought little tike before . but i'm not sure i again . refrigerator door doesn't even come close fitting . oven door warped one side doesn't close . it repeats same phrases over over . tape shipping left ink doors . we very disappointed whole kitchen set	-1
i purchased this my 2 boys , 5 3 , february . got it clearance walmart $19 , but would not wanted spend much more it . i debated whether get this or kitchen made cooking sounds but didn't speak 3 languages , since we're trying raise our children bilingual ( least ! ) we thought talking kitchen would preferable . unfortunately , voices hard understand - not they're soft , but there seems lot mumbling static , so if you don't know exactly what voice saying already , you wouldn't able learn , example , spanish word bacon " tocino " - it sounds more like " poseena " . beyond , however , both boys enjoyed it . it little small 5-yr old now but they both still play it . they occasionally get frustrated only cookie sheet fit into oven ( you can't put pot or nearly any other cooking vessel our other playsets ) . reason this obvious- sensor talking feature top oven , thus order close enough food sensor respond whatever there , floor oven raised rather high . if i it again , i would probably look kitchen set only cooking sounds not talking feature , it just not used often this house .	1
so many art smocks too little elementary students , but these big enough both fit cover school uniforms ! hooray no more paint white shirts	1
this fun family game . it educational good way kids learn value dollar . it , however , million pieces you could easily lose - which nightmare mom dad ! however , this remains one my kids favorite games even my 12 year old	-1

most ride toys very wide , which make pushing little hard . this toy thin ; therefore , my 2 yr old son loves it more than any other push toy . this so so cute , i wish there more stickers , but who cares , it worth buy ! i hated paying 8-9 dollar shipping , but motorcycles this cute hard find ... this light easy throw truck take	1
idog very cute , but he takes long time get going sucks batteries down record time . too bad , because he nice way play your music .	-1
i've trying get some sort way listen my i-pod without earbuds . i not going spend $100 bucks boom box just i-pods . so it caught my attention while i herbergers noticed i could listen music through dog . it cute so i grabbed it . you put two aa batteries dog leg . then you just plug your i-pod instant music . sound isn't good stereo system which makes this good me since i live condo not want make lot noise . dog cute its head turns its ears go up down beat music . there also lights go off beat music too . it also cries barks . kinda gets annoying after awhile . it demands attention . if you pull its tail it growls . you control songs volume through your i-pod . this cute cheap way listen your i-pod without spending lot money or lot hassle .	-1

what bunch junk ! upon opening megaland , i noticed it ripped seam one area . this pretty large rip i might add . after inspecting it more i noticed dozen more places where it ripped . i noticed parent said same thing . now i know why it half off ! don't waste your money .	-1
it good toy but balls rather small youmust check seams when they arrive poor sowin	-1
let me start saying my son this toy over three years it his absolute favorite . since he it so long i tell you its very durable . we haven't any problems . this one only toy he used every single day since we bought it . he uses it pretty much everything , but especially cleaning up . he uses it gather up all his toys take them his bedroom put away . he also loves use it play store . only problem this toy : when his friends come over they want play it too ! maybe i should get few more them ! i would highly recommend this toy anyone !	1

i remember reading lotr i loved series peter jackson version . once i heard monopoly edition lotr , i excited . i soon won lotr monopoly edition . i came home , invited some relatives soon great time ! you know , monopoly game inwhich you ultimate monopoly . you buy sell property , if you own mt . doom bara-dur ( boardwalk park place original monopoly ) then you get monopoly . you build strongholds ( houses ) fortresses ( hotels ) everytime rival lands your property , then he give you power ( money ) . if you can't pay rent then you'll become bankrupt you out . you also avoid jail . there some new tokens resemble characters lotr . if you look screenshots this monopoly game then you'll notice lot changes . but there new optional rule you play this version ; everytime you roll " eye sauron " ( also counts one ) golden ring move one territory per eye , where you add strongholds . if you land territory ring , you may get it free ! if you land owned territory ring it , you pay double rent . so , if you 100% die-hard lotr only enjoy books , then you miss . but if you looking monopoly board or lotr stuff , i recommend this game thennote : if tolkien lived see this , he would died immediatly . infact , i think he rolling his grave i am typing this review .	1
i hard time finding dishes someone under 3 years age . these perfect 2 year old . she really enjoys them , loves making " soup hot " her daddy . it includes pots pans little spatula serving spoon so she learns how use these things . it helps dexterit	-1
my one year olds twins received this christmas discover sounds kitchen . my daughter sticks her hand down ball drop hole pick up ball instead getting ball side pocket . once she ball her hand , she cannot get her hand back out hasn't figured out drop ball . this happened three different times . once , she walked off dragging workshop behind her until i caught up her . she not injured , but very upset . i sit right next her when she playing workshop , or put it up . my twins use discover sounds kitchen more often we not any problems it .	1
my son received this workshop 8 months still plays it all time 19 months . he mostly enjoys dropping balls through chute cramming things into overhead compartment . we also bought discover sounds hammer sold accessory , but it really too heavy him use first . he still doesn't pay much attention it . light-weight hammer comes workshop just fine . workshop durable also . my daughter sits nails , so far it held up well	1
my son received this toy christmas last year when he 9 months old . he now 18 months old still doesn't play it . it just doesn't hold his interest . other hand , he could play all ; day plain old little tikes workbench . this definitely not worth money - there more entertaining work bench toys out there	-1

i know amazon description says this babies 3 months 2 years , but i just buy this early after i read all great reviews . when it arrived , i attached it activity gym ( i uploaded photo it if you interested seeing how i this ) . my baby boy , benjamin , immediately grabbed it . he only 6 weeks old time , so i am sure it just coincidence , but it made me feel bad i not offered him toys level he could reach before this . throughout first day , he became fascinated toy . he quickly learned how grab ( even though his depth perception still off ) i believe this toy helped him develop his " grabbing skills " faster than if i not purchased this toy . i am sure this toy going get lot use my baby boy . he now decided it more fun kick it than grab it . personally , i believe this toy should lower age recommendation . he only half way there i know i could given it him sooner .	1
i bought this my 5 year old son christmas . not only he think it great but also his 7 9 year old sisters . there so many games there something all them . we took toy us grandma even older cousins found it very fun entertaining . i really like they play all games spanish too . once they got hang game english they it spanish it helps increase their vocabulary . i little nervous if it would worth $50 because i seen barbie laptops some others radio shack . this one seemed like best choice hoping this would worth it . my opinion it much better than others we tried store i would definately recommend it	1

we bought this our girls ( 4 2 yrs ) last christmas so we last year model so i vouch how well this held up . they still love it play it daily . great wooden design sturdy construction , but let me tell you this no small undertaking assemble ; it easy but time consuming . if i only could paid santa assemble ! other than , compared other wooden kitchens , it great product this price point much better quality than plastic ones make noises etc . it larger reality kids use their imagination don't need all other stuff . my girls cook , bang , open doors shove stuff it it takes it like champ ! only drawback primarily made feminine colors so if you little man loves cook target now carries great little wooden kitchen blue stainless steel look it plus they carry great wooden food accessories .	1
i just purchased this game my 3-1/2 year daughter . she dora fan , so she wanted play it immediately . she sat there played entire game one sitting . basically , dora boots adventure help find pieces tico aircraft . swiper makes his regular appearances well . i help her understand how something couple places , but otherwise it right her level . she knows her numbers colors she very excited she able progress . best part game , my opinion , your little one able make jumps without any problem . pooh game her other favorite ( great game ) , but she needs help making some jumps . dora game , dora won't fall if you keep walking when you supposed jump - she just leans over his tippie toes like she going fall . my daughter especially proud fact she able jump swinging vines . i highly recommend this game !	1
my son neo ( 4 1/2 ) got this game yesterday we opened it he played all way throught learning adventure out stopping . controls this game seem alittle more responsive than older games . dora speaks both english spanish : colors , numbers , animals . if you going get smartridge this one get	1
no more quick-swingers sitting pitches , frustrating even most creative movement pitchers . now , quick twist red centerpiece , wiffle ball added new pitch - real fastball ( without wiffled movement ) - keep those batters check . this ball amazing things little changeable ring . i just wish quality little better so red ring wouldn't fly off easily after well-hit pitch , which also sometimes causes ball start cracking around center . but said , junk ball easily lasts least one 7-inning , tw o-o ut game . , oh , trickery	1

i needed kitchen my 3 yr old daughter would fit into very small space ... but one enjoyable play . we received it very quickly , time her birthday , although she not played it yet ; i test run it it seems made very well ; especially price . it small but many different little areas she work either slide out or open up . it would probably difficult more than two children , max , really play this same time ( again b/c size ) unless they some other accompanying toys like table chairs so one child could chef others could help preapre food table or customers , taking turns , etc ... tipping over part reviewer mentioned , hers against wall ; i think most people their toy kitchens so i dont think would problem . all ; good basic kitchen great price	1

i loved electronic talking battleship kid 1980 anxious recently play this game again . i always excited looking through back play booklet when picking out board . i also always nervous when opposing player would hit red button , firing their missile . you hope they'll miss but you'll get bit nervous once they manage hit one your ships . you also hope they won't sink all your ships before you figure out where their ships . other hand , when you're one pressing red button , you're eager hear crashing sound - hitting one your opponent ships . good feature this game you play someone or you play against computer . when someone plays against computer , one usually loses . but i recall kid beating computer few times so that not case here . all , electronic talking battleship worth money bring many hours entertainment . great investment ! - donna di giacom	1

my son three yrs old 42 inches , we keep it next last highest setting it enjoyable him we probably need put it highest setting soon probably need bigger one next summer . he alot fun it although it not very tall or not ability go tall some other models , he still fun trying aim shoot hoop so we use it practice these skills before buying . you definitely need fill base sand before using ( not use water substitue ) it tip over repeatedly without sand per directions . overall just like any basketball set this one provides great outdoor/indoor fun well exercise durable compared others its price point . we not problems height adjustment bar or any parts falling off my son rough this toy b/c i not fill sand right away it fallen numerous time seems wearing well . so i think it great deal price	-1

i agree previous review you get what you pay . but future i would highly recommend paying more once instead replace this food few months or so . we received this gift outside it looked like great choice ! i very happy . but we this package food one week i am already taping boxes packaging tape keep them together . little hands pull apart milk , juice snack boxes no time . cans food so small they topple over easily play kitchen . pies , pizza , such food all actually hollow underneath . there no base them . they tell you 101 pieces but our kit it counted 8 hotdogs ( without buns ) , 12 individual french fries same potato chips . not necessary especially since you also get two french fry packets french fry container you get hot dog bun separately . why would my child want four jalepenos too . so much this food not they type thing small child would familiar . anyway , my opinion spend money smaller quantity higher quality food or go online find " vintage " fisher price or little tikes food . now those made last good size small hands .	-1
my daughter recieved this kitchen today , she absolutely loves it ! bins left side really need back them so things don't fall out . i would recommend putting this toy together ratchet equipped screwdriver bit adapter otherwise you sore wrist because it takes while get screws through thick plastic parts . this toy definately designed durable . i am sure it withstand whatever my daughter could it . overall i think it good investment very cute toy	1
i purchased this kitchen my daughter christmas . it arrived i started assemble it only find few minor manufacturer defects one pieces compramised way it assembled way it would " wear " over time . i called little tikes ' customer service phone number after explaining problem they said they would send me new part immediately . i haven't received it just yet but they said they would try get it here before christmas . i dissappointed when i found defect certain , one week remaining before christmas , i would difficulty getting someone respond my request help . i spoke nicest man little tikes so impressed how company stood behind it product sent needed part absolutely no hassle ! they didn't require me prove part defective or even return it them ..... they simply took my word it . i am impressed , more than ever , little tikes company appreciates their customers ...... even it they aren't making " large " purchases . this not one their most expensive kitchens yet they still stood behind quality their product !! i'll try update this review once i've recieved new part entire transaction complete .	-1

my 6 year old son got this his birthday it first toy he wanted play , so once his guests left we set it up started playing . it comes six different themed 9-hole courses , we played all six once , they all fun their own way unique obstacles . lowest score each course gets saved player gets input his name future bragging rights . design toy unique . you aim turning dial top toy , you use club long-handled lever so you don't need bend over strokes . once your shot set up you swing club over " golf ball " part toy , how fast you swing determines on-screen speed your putt . unfortunately my son managed whack toy several times during our evening play , when we set it up this morning round he hit toy couple more times . problem compounded because while real golf you watch ball intention actually hitting it , this game you feel compelled watch on-screen action while swinging above ball . our game this morning ended when on-screen picture started flicker toy finally froze 9th hole ; freezing much same way your windows computer locks up . turning toy off resolved problem but our next game we got just 4 holes when problem returned game froze once again . while i'll acknowledge toy take several good whacks my son , i'd expect more toy designers should anticipated would get hit , hit frequently . we'll return this our local toy store exchange it , perhaps we just got faulty toy . we'll know within couple days if problem just we got faulty toy , or if mb dropped ball this one	1
christmas approaches , i thought i would give counter argument all these wonderful reviews gator . i received gift my two boys ( aged 3 5 time)2 years ago . initially gator great . apart major traction issues ( it terrible any type moistrue grass ) , guys loved it , it worked well . after 3-4 months , it began fail . gear box started slip . windshield cracked clean off . seat adjusters lost their screws . bunch other stuff . it very fragile toy , needs taken into account anyone purchasing this good , hearty kids like good time , but extremely rough toys . general , i am fan peg perego , so makes this even greater dissapointment . price , i would look elsewhere	-1

my son received these christmas his 1st birthday . he loves it when he matches up animals or vehicles makes them make sounds . he hasn't mastered it but more fun it . now he 2 1/2 he even more interested how it works . although word caution . when he teething he thought these blocks great scrape his gums . which would fine because they smooth but they little rubber dots contend . he managed pop off one now ambulance doesn't sound . he not swollow dot ( which easy happen ) . but these essential cause effect toys all children love . we gave our neice farm set she still plays it daily . great toy but little thing remember rubber dots ... supervise count dots	1
this sad . game ton potential ( who doesn't want play golden tee home ? ) yet sorely lacking . i can't believe golden tee people put their brand name this . hope someone company made buck off this lousy game cause they sure cheapened their name this junk . fact this game runs off batteries should warning sign . it just plain weak . complaints : graphics lousy , there only one course , putting looks/plays awful , trackball bad , whole interface slow , sound effects seem era pong . it really really bad . i don't know why they made this game . golden tee such cult following they could probably charged 100+ bucks real trackball console bit memory choice courses w/ good graphics . something replicated full-size game . i bet people would bought it , too . now nobody trust them when/if they ever . [ ... ] i don't even like video games but i excited prospect this thing . it totally let me down . i'd give it zero stars if possible	-1

quite few reviews compared zoob legos which compare apples oranges . i major lego fan since i could assemble two blocks , already purchased sets my son , but legos more building buildings , boats , man-made things general , whereas zoob much more organic allowing you create living movable things such dinosaurs , spiders , snakes , creatures all shapes , including primordial . you also build cars motorcycles , but point this toy more building singular objects rather than cities villages i used build legos . toy sturdy if handled properly . it entertaining adults children our family	1
zoob car design works other zoob pieces allow so many possibilities . loads fun , i think age recommendation right . my 4-yr-old needed little help this one first couple times . this toy take beating monster trucks fly down steps into walls without broken piece date	1
this great toy . very durable . this batmobile built last ! my son looooooves it	1
i bought this version batmobile instead rc version because it not pricey didn't require separately-purchased , expensive battery . this version great batmobile . electronic lights sounds cool , rockets hide great inside chassis , everything looks great . it great roll across floor startle any sleeping pets . only problem ? battle gear batman figure i not fit cockpit . cockpit way too small , requiring you bend jam your batman action figure limbs trying unsuccessfully force it into cockpit seat , even then it doesn't fit . i like take care my things , since i see them more collector items rather than toys . i wanted this batmobile safe place my batman figure , which normally lies out open . so unfortunately , this big disappointment . oh well , rest batmobile looks great	1

( this one only tubs its price range colorchanging water fall seats built we seen ) . our first hottub we alot research decided we not want rewire our electric case we want move it around . it made great price shell very sturdy . it take quite while heat up ( we live near chicago so it cold here ) . but once heated it retains heat well . if considering tub this price range i would definately consider this tub . we use it every day , even freezing weather right out back concrete pad . only thing we kind wish we would bought x-500 model which seats five lounger seat it , but i am sure we getting our moneys worth this	1
i am generous giving this thing star , it more like -10 stars !! far , absolute worst toy i've ever bought !! i paid $19.99 this piece garbage . within 5 hours setting it up it collapsed permanently . no bottom support it . it these silly plastic tubes you put over both door ways ( supposedly support it ) those broken less than 24 hours . wire holds up tent very flimsy bends easily so almost instantly my kids bent it out shape once thing won't stand up . four years ago we bought plastic hello kitty tent yard sale dollar friend gave us plastic house shaped frame it thing lasted years , i expecting too much this one i suppose . makes me mad since i paid retail dumb thing . don't buy this toy unless you money throw away !!! yours soon turn garbage like mine !!! absolute trash !! before purchasing this my son christmas he really into making forts , so i set up card table gave him 2 old sheets some pillows blankets inside he happy camper , thought this would add his enjoyment since it spider-man !!! i throwing spiderman out setting up card table again !! i repeat .... don't waste your hard earned dollars this one !!	-1

first let me say this ... anyone who not know purchase or least check make sure batteries come any toy these days idiot . second ... if you half brain , you'd charge thing before you wrapped it up . way it ready go . yes ... $100 alot cash .. but we all end up paying it see look kids ' faces . however , all just stated mute point when addressing this toy . it absolute junk .. if you gotten more than hour play out it , you one few lucky ones . it takes very little pressure " fins " overpower gears while morphing . point , gears break you $100 paper weight . now ... you send it back .. amazon absolutely took care us ... but what you going get return same piece junk ... only new shiny , broken hour again . we purchased two .. one each boys . gears broke one first hour . while using it inside . amazon replaced it very quickly . i think it lasted couple hours . second shocker same electrical problem others stating . doesn't want power up . we even went trouble finding battery ... local wal-mart all places . still not work . save your money this one .. it looks like couple people lucked out theirs .. but read all reviews . majority people same problems . unfortunately , we purchased ours early ... there no reviews read all .	-1

i'm 21 year old my little pony collector recently friend work brought my attention " ponyville " mini ponies , which i initially skeptical . but oh my gosh ! i think i like them more than regular ponies ! sorry , girls !! ponies small , but sturdy you don't worry their hair getting tangled because they all moulded plastic , but fabulous attention detail ! pinkie pie balloon house such wonderful playset , if you're going buy one playset , buy this one . it more fun than sweet shop , my opinion . froggy adorable , removeable his fountain . house itself snaps shut so your little one carry it her . tiny pieces either pegs hold them place or put tiny drawer bedroom . i love how precious bathroom , even though we're left wonder ; where my little ponies answer calls nature ? there also " add ons " you buy , such triple treat ice cream thingie sunny swing . they each around $5 ! conclusion , this playset sturdy , well made , clever doesn't take up nearly much room regular mlp playset , you infinitely add things , making it more fun ( i embellished mine new mccdonalds toys other ponyville accessory sets ) . make sure you get one your little girl	1

i love my first leappad system my son so much fun using it . unfortunatly , spongebob square pants best friend adventures i purchased defective . what i first noticed pages just tad too wide fit into system . i could tell comparing it other books there extra space one side . i tried remedy this myself shaving off tiny bit make it fit into system . once it fit we tried out book i found all sensors or touchpoints way off , inch or so some cases . i called companies customer service department through conversation also found pages out order possibly missing . gentleman very nice helpful sent me replacement book . but book didn't fit ! it same problem pages out order . i emailed company asked replacement completely different title . i think 2 defective books same title enough hassle we move onto new one . this only book we trouble . all other titles fit worked just fine us . kudos their customer service department though !	-1
my son ( 5 yrs ) recieved this christmas . neighborhood girls love play it him . we also sleepovers 4 extra boys ranging age 3 yrs 7 years they all loved it . we put heavy book each side end track , like directions say , it works great . we also put pillow front/behind door keep it moving . these kids gone so far make cardboard target place it so they ' get points ' each time it comes zooooming down hits it . we get big screams when cardboard'ring fire ' used car goes thru without hitting it(this comes set ) . this elevator great invention . only thing i would change grey piece under track holds end track up . it often comes loose car jump off end straight instead jumping up . i guess we tape it until we get more track add this baby . great fun !	1

you totally see through my tiles . i bought mine couple years ago . model number box says , 04623 . looks me like there bad batch them made . when i younger , i one fine . game fun , reasonably priced , educational kids well . i like it because it doesn't take long play , several people all get turn within hour . i written hasbro regarding tiles . not sure why i waited 2 years so , but hopefully they make good this problem .	-1

i showed my 20 mo . old daughter this wal-mart she adored it ever since . it worried me she forcefully bent back characters all time , but 2 months later they're still going strong . this piano 8 songs , one each character . each bit 10 seconds long approx . " wigglegroove " " rolling down sandhills " " music w/ murray " " where jeff ? " " vegetable soup " " all i need food " " play your guitar . murray " " calling all cows " . that more than enough entertain child age . she follow some what they're singing like " clap your hands spin around " . also it nice there two volume levels so not vex harried parents . worst thing happened toy got liitle wet underneath some piano keys won't work anymore ... she hardly pays them anyway pull guys jump recorded songs . ages 1-3 this toy fun , if your kid loves wiggles like mine .	-1

we bought this book our daughter because she loves all characters associated winnie pooh . we quickly discovered what others noted , namely , it rather slow-paced when compared my first leappad other books . songs slower , story , activities much more laid-back . so while it doesn't hold our daughter attention long normal times , we found it good slowing down pace rainy days or just before bedtime . which she not learned much this book others , slower pace seems calming effect her , which any parent four year-old attest , blessing	1

when my daughter opened this her 1st birthday my immediate thought - oh , keyboard ( she got 4 this year ) . this one cute toy . it so many functions i am sure she use more more she gets older . it keyboard but also plays individual songs , ball drop teaches cause effect . its bright colored lights up isnt tooo loud . one huge point me , it comes 4 balls . its built store balls when not use . she fisherprice ball drop toy balls all over our house because there nowhere store them . now granted , my daughter hasnt this very long so we not time get sick main song but so far she really loves it exploring all different things it . i believe this toy staying power . i just wish it little sturdier . she tries pull up it put balls top it topples right over	-1

i four children ages 4-10 we bought many " make your own food " kits . this one best far . directions really easy . my six eight year olds needed little guidance , but my ten year old fine doing these herself . projects all very quickly ( 3-5 minutes most ) , ready eat right away . even gummy-type creatures only cool five minutes . we candy-making kit national geographic there not one project there eaten less than hour half . real bummer kids ! dr. dreadful also nice because nearly everything you need this kit . only thing you'll need provide water . it even comes its own measuring spoon ! some other kits require you provide lots extra ingredients household items ( sugar , salt , string , waxed paper , etc . ) there enough ingredients this kit make dozens projects . there lot parts this kit , so make sure all pieces cleaned up . we lost one little plastic disk ( i found it floor no idea what it so i threw it away ) now we can't make gummy creatures very easily . dr. " experiments " all pretty tasty , especially kids . this toy really big hit our house .	1

" one answer " condom ... " negatives - some answers i considered way off , like " what complaint people valet service ? " all answers revolved around too expensive , or driver drove too fast , took too long . i thought answers like , " he adjusted my seat , changed radio presetting stations , moved side mirrors , stole cd ... " so , some answers unreasonable . question asked , " what appliance you might ask help moving , " number 1 answer sofa , but washer/dryer wasn't even listed . didn't make sence me . also speed round , i dissappointed when speed round came around only top rated answer each question revealed worth points . television version , more than one answer valuated points . positives - screen " how play " icon thoroughly walk you through object game , it simple point . game fast paced , completely self explanatory , very compact , would great go vacations , takes no set up time , easy learning curve , game prompts you what when . bright colorful display attractive screen game menus makes it fun play " elevator music " timing your responses . conclusion - it really fun game play if you least 5 minutes sit your family play game . it go anywhere , creative , thought provoking game everyone enjoy contributing	-1

you know , i found this game quite annoying ( there lot singing each players turn)- but my 5 year old son loves it . there no dice , no spinner ( so none those pieces lose :) , but it tells you how many spaces move . so , one player easy question may get move 8 spaces , while player hard question only gets move 3 spaces . i guess that plus because you can't cheat ( it even tells you which color you land ) , but process , it makes game rather simple . my son would rather play himself so he doesn't lose . questions not challenging my son ( he just turned 5 may ) , so i guess it gives him since " hey ! i'm smart , i know all this stuff "	-1

terence my two year old son favorite train thomas books . we bought him wooden terence local toy store , only discover his treads came off thirty seconds after he came out box . this real pain - i put treads away let my son use terence like regular train , which he didn't mind too much but it bit upsetting pay ten dollars toy then it poor quality . few days later , we different toy store saw terence redesigned ! unfortunately , store we bought him doesn't refunds , only exchanges . i went home called learning curve 800 number , very nice customer service lady gave me address told me they would replace my son terence new one . i mailed him back , got new one few weeks , he great . treads don't come off , he rolls plain table , track , even carpet wonderfully . my son very happy he wondered what happened his old terence . learning curve lifetime garuntee all their products so if you old terence i reccommend giving them call they let you exchange it new one ( even if you bought it three years ago ! )	1
i purchased this my 3 year old son no sooner than we taken him out box ran it table treads came off . i am constantly looking treads , or fixing them . all other thomas toys we great , but terrance doesn't seem durable others , thus making this toy my opinion flop	-1
i bought this year or so ago my daughter -- she still " plays " it regularly . quantum pad books targeted older kids but my younger children also enjoy playing them . my daughter 8 quantum books , enjoys every single one them . my * main * concern when i deciding purchase this or not : -durability ( it well made)-diversity books contents ( lots books choose , it take regular leap pad books too . also , lots different interesting facts books -- not boring all . )-battery consumption ( no problem there either--i've only change it once -- maybe twice -- past year)after i bought this , i bought ' my first leappad ' my youngest ... he enjoys it so much . right now i'm searching good deal " leappad plus writing " ( possibly one ' microphone')--that how much i like leappad ' system'--the children get hours hours fun learning . price worth it , my opinion ... : 0 ) -- actually , you even find my husband and/or me playing this too : 0) -- my only gripe this system quantum pad bag ( sold separately) -- it doesn't hold lot books ( it made 4 book 4 cartridge) -- but my daughter squeezed all 8 hers : 0 )	1
this toy not safe other children , batteries keep running out every time i play 20 minutes how rude . that why i don't play my leadpay no more cause mommy saids i'm busy honey i can't go out buy some sorry . where ever i touch leapad said something wrong wrost all i get something right it saids its wrong once you play like 5 days it bores you already .... stop selling this !!!!!!!! but its kind fun once you learn something you never knew it talk so this not boring . this should schools why no	-1

[ ... ] now our guy walking pretty well , he still loves this toy . i recently used some bicycle-chain lubricant wheels so they would stop squeaking so much . however , i'm not sure i'd recommend doing if you still pre-walker . wheel friction also helped slow cart down bit	1

honestly , i not familiar sudoku before purchasing this game . i heard it knew it new " craze " but i never played it . buying christmas presents i picked up several these decided keep one myself . i find it completely enjoyable . i not use dry erase pen yet but i appreciate it there case i need mark screen . i not any trouble viewing screen - it not light up i know some this one things i considered when buying this particular game , but i find i see it just fine . buttons easy use . after playing it several times , i am not sure i would even like model touch screen instead stylus instead . this fun highly addictive . it great item when you waiting anything - nice little time waster actually uses your brain cells but not so difficult take away entertainment ( there several levels choose so you select level you comfortable - admittedly , i only ventured second level this point ) . anyway , nice priced diversion . i recommend it whole heartedly	1
this thing awsome . though i wish it litlle clearer directions	-1

legos great they always , there endless things them they fit together perfectly ! fact legos not made china ( some sets 1 or 2 small parts but bulk their goods made elsewhere ) gives them extra points this family :-) only reason these not earn 5 star rating description amazon gave described set containing " gold " ( color ) bricks which set we received not contain	-1
i initially bought this set my three-year-old but thought better it since he almost 4 . so , i bought him regular set legos going take these back . however , after much frustration smaller legos , i.e. not able get them apart very easily , etc ., i brought these out well , it true love ever since . i really recommend these younger set - i bought smaller ones because i didn't think he'd get much good out these since they indicate they're only age 5 . don't pay any attention age these . they expand older kids use these since they smaller ones say age three , i wouldn't pay attention either . grab bigger ones ages 2-6 or so , they able use them fun well	1
this best toy we ever bought our 3 year old . he plays non-stop this both outdoors our basement . i worried it might go through alot batteries but hasnt case . he learned hit so well i'm little scared he won't find t-ball very stimulating . adults alot fun this too ! if we paid 4 times what it cost i would still say it worth every penny ! this one wont get left behind huge pile unused toys . definitely great toy thats easy pocketbook	1
these durable , well-constructed wooden puzzles big hit 18 months + crowd . i believe my son love trucks started this educational puzzle . pieces easy little hands grasp attached pegs , puzzle easy yet developmentally sound toddlers definitely worth money . yourself favor though -- get puzzle holder if you plan purchasing few these types puzzles ..	1
we pretty much all potc toys made ! megabloks black pearl pirate ship lot detail lot pieces . we two these they each took 20 minutes build . ships fragile so if your child likes play rough they come apart . my 7yo 4yo boys love them anyway . they rich detail my kids into their imaginary play hours them . we also zizzle black pearl pirate ship . it doesn't nearly many parts ( not " lego " style like megabloks ) bigger . it some cool electronic noises trap doors , but not detailed megabloks version . megabloks version real sails too . zizzle ship no action figures , so you order 3 " figures separately ( my kids just use their megabloks figures ) . their other favorites megabloks flying dutchman ( built lot like black pearl ) dead man chest . these sets must potc fan	-1

every year parents grandparents search ultimate toy - one kids love spend hours playing while others piled up under tree still their boxes .... well , this toy ! first all , it easy assemble while two 3 1/2 year old waited impatiently . they both mesmerized quickly began piecing tracks together help . it quickly assembled into figure eight shown box , no instructions needed . two little ones spent hours playing .... no derailments either . these cars stay their track even when pieces aren't perfectly aligned . this equal opportunity toy i loved seeing my 3 1/2 year old daughter play something wasn't doll related change . she her two year old boy cousin each separate set , which some bigger " boys " turned into one bigger track , but each their own set two cars - so fighting minimal . if purchasing multiple children share i would recommend adding additional engine cars passenger cars eliminate competition control . there enough room multiple cars different intervals track simultaneously .	1
my 3 year old received this toy christmas . she enjoys putting puzzles together very much . however , she trouble getting them apart - wooden pieces not come apart very easily . we already 4 or 5 pieces broken - layer wood come off , either off picture part or back piece . i disappointed when piece broke after we only puzzles few days ! wood very thin . shapes back great sorting pieces , but compartments hold pieces aren't big enough . if pieces don't go " just so " - lid won't close . puzzles nice , but i would not purchase this toy again due quality	-1
delivery quick it exactly what i expected ! love it	1

we got this my son 2nd birthday ( since he loves his duplo blocks ) he really loves thomas train track now 2 1/2 put it together himself , i just wish i could get more track , especially straight track pieces make this set bigger more interesting than simple oval or bean shape ( all pieces curved this set . ) percy/toby/james sets cute but only come few pieces track , i might buy one anyway since whenever he little friend over they fight over train so it would good 2 trains . my only compaint it hard my son keep trains track , wheels lined up exactly groves track , i often push it around him no problem , but he gets so excited he usually runs it off track before even getting half way around , hopefully he outgrow this ! i would recommend this older toddlers preschooler , it very durable . if anyone knows where get more track please let me know :	-1

my 6 year old got this guitar three kings day ( precisely today , january 6 ) . my opinion songs only appropiate girls age 6 up , since it 2 cartridges 6 popular rock-pop songs you find comercials kids bop songs cartoon network . volume control great , so way you don't get headaches loud constant play , but headset kind confusing . i posted some images my daughter ( brunette one ) showing " i guess " correct way wear headphones . overall , i like this guitar anyways . hope this help other moms .	-1

whew ! i just put this thing together i say it coolest . it took me probably hour ( only because i am not good nautical knots ) i am really impressed quality this toy . detail incredible . price very affordable , especially considering quality this ship . i looking muti-purpose " pirate ship " bought this particular ship because playmobil name , great price , fact it floats well rolls around wheels . it really hard find bath toys five year old . i can't give you feedback far my son ( soon five ) conserned because it bithday gift ( now how i wrap this ?? ) . but honestly if he dosent like it ; i am apt keep it myself ! i plan buy maybe castle or vacation home next . i just hope he lets me play them once awhile !!!! tip : most playmobil sets , give yourself hour or two assemble them if you would like your child able play them soon they get them . p.s. this toy come 5 hand guns . since this concern mine , putting it together before giving it him i opportunity toss these before he gets his hands them . plus , i tell him swords knifes come it cutting up fish fruit keep away scurrvey . oh yeah , course all treasure stolen pirates distributed poor !	1
response : they ( bratz ) teech kids act like some gangster goes around kills people ! babys wear chains , goodness sake !!!!!!! " reply : last time i checked , bratz dolls . nothing else . parents , listen me . if your parenting skills so dismal your kids acts like doll , then you need counseling , not ban bratz dolls . kid , i played working woman barbie , if you knew me , you'd know i'm farthest thing coffee-chugging , business-suit-wearing blonde who goes dates ken thinks " going work fun . " like most people , i developped continue develop based influences around me my own personality , not some doll . true , dolls might present some little girls ' dreams . they used marketing ploy well . but most part , bratz won't turn your kids into short-skirt-wearing , hair-obsessed lolitas . one way or , your kid discover mtv all destined give parents headaches . how your kids turn out up you them . dolls used fantasies , if you try limit your kid fantasy , then you're creating " forbidden fruit " , which actually encourages rules broken ! if your kid wants bratz , buy them bratz . if want barbie , get ' em barbie . both end up naked bathroom floor . you should worried if your precious princess wants play undress boys , not dolls . finally , bratz not gangsters . all you know , they might representations nice girls who just happen like fashion . whatever happened don't judge book its cover , hm ? erm , all . chow ! don't touch sushi . xoxoxo , roxann	1

truth , raider tower really brings nothing new megabloks dragons line ( other than new faction , iron raiders ) . all figures dragons repaints , no new pieces included , far i see . said , it still way better than newest line , metal ages , whose constructions pieces mostly useless making your own creations , whose figures come much smaller amounts per kit ( largest comes only 6 , much less than older kits like dragair castle ) . older kits like iron raiders simpler , yet they come many more pieces , more figures , whole lot more playability , you see my review . first all , kit comes large metal tin , perfect transporting pieces elsewhere . when i opened tin , i surprised find many more plastic bags than i expected find . opening all them took few minutes , but i soon all pieces layed out , started build . i expected ( i've other unenjoyable builds megabloks kits ) construction process not nearly fun standard lego kit . it often took lot effort snap pieces together , once , i even take down part assembly fix mistake , due sometimes unclear instructions . still , tower came together without too much hassle , everything else kit . once completed , though , tower something gaze . construction detail pieces excellent , tower whole really good looking . i especially like bridge leads tower little details like torches dragons heads . interior whole different story , however , it virtually non existent . this came downer me , i hoped something more than just ladder trapdoor . good thing megabloks compatible legos , so you easily create your own interior ! ( i added table food chairs , throne , some weapons racks . ) dragons , course , included , since this fairly large kit . red dragon named ignistrafe monster named grovel found this kit , both which need assembly . pieces , once again , often hard snap , but once together , don't break off very easily . dragon very detailed , painted over 6 different colors , monster . they both great display , since they both features ( dragons wings flap his claw pick up minifigures , monster jaws snap shut when opened ) , they great playing well . minifigures also well detailed , although they fewer colors than dragons . kit comes 10 , 6 iron raiders 4 draigar warriors , enough good battle this kit alone . they , however , simply repaints dragair , norvagen , vorgan minifigures , all which came previous series , krystal wars . their fingers also fairly fragile , 2 my figures only hold weapons or shields one their hands now . one other thing : while iron raiders came apart easily , draigar warriors seem glued together , although their joints still move . other things included catapult , harpoon launcher some sort , 2 horses , large selection weapons shields . weapons come all sort shapes , clubs , swords , axes make up most them . now , one most important parts kit pieces , this kit aces area ! pieces include basic corner triangle castle walls , rocks rock walls , ladders , dragons heads , torches , 2 stone arches , stairs , few basic bricks , lots baseplates , flag pole . everything needed make castle , bridge , or some other medieval structure here , making kit great parts building pack . there also crystal , which , when inserted into holder , lights up flashes . effect neat , you also plug it into red dragon saddle same thing happen . last thing i judging this kit playability , even here , kit well . you great battles all things included , young kids love features like catapult trap door . since kit figures also disassembled , you simulate battle damage you play , knocking off walls or torches while playing . overall , i think kit definitely worth it . i would not recommend it someone under 6 , due difficulty construction , but anyone over age who loves legos megabloks love this kit . even someone who new building sets appreciate large amount figures playability , although i still would recommend lego set over this . i leave you this final thought : i used consider megabloks poor quality , but after buying this kit , i changed my mind .	-1

my son 5 years old big fan pirates toys . when i saw box i extremely impressed display . box advised toy kids 6 older . ship " lego " type structure requiring some assembly . i prior experience assembling lego models i felt i up task . what i learn this definitely isn't same quality lego product pieces would not lock together . upon assembling main structure , pieces would snap out place out warning . after 20 minutes stress trying keep structure intact during assembly process , i decided it time take break . returned 20 minutes later , portion structure i able lock pieces together again started fall-apart . i proceeded shove pieces back box rush it back department store refund . maybe i patience 6 year old , but i can't see my 5 year old enjoying playing toy which collapses when moved . pros : box packaging impressive . look feel pieces very detailedconsinstructions could clearer . although lego concept isn't difficult , lot trial error required . quality control not what i'm used . son never chance play this item it never assembled . i replaced it playmobil pirate ship my son really enjoyed playing this product	-1

chomp fast card game works best three or more players but still several variations use two players . object simple , get all cards . this simulating food chain ocean very quick recognize cards react faster than other players . chain represented plankton , shrimp , small fish , large fish , seals , sharks . there also electric eels octopus ink add some twists . after cards evenly distributed among players , they all reveal their top card simultaneously . this card represents them food chain . object first player slap their hand lowest link yell " chomp ! " player gets collect cards played . there penalties chomping when you shouldn't or chomp wrong thing . player who lowest hand can't chomp anything . if octopus comes into play , its ink keeps everyone getting eaten . these cards held side included next hand winnings . if electric eel played , it starts feeding frenzy ( even if there octopus ) . first player slap eel yell " feeding frenzy !

wow . this game ingenius idea ! why didn't i think it ? those who love good , fun , educational , durable , perfect game , try apples apples ! it doesn't matter if you get junior edition or party box expansion - they're all great editions my favorite game . if you haven't played apples apples , you need play now . game play basic simple - you don't smartest person class figure out how play ! anyone any age , try apples apples - i've even seen three year old play ! basically , judge , which everyone gets chance , hands everyone five cards . then , judge lays green card down center . each player looks through their cards , which they don't show anyone , lays down one card theirs facedown fits adjective green card . judge doesn't lay card down . then , judge turns cards up chooses most creative card fits adjective . end game , whoever most green cards wins . try it today , or you're seriously missing out . mandy	1

i purchased this puzzle , similar rain forest puzzle , my 4-year old daughter birthday . my purchase based other favorable reviews my previous experience melissa doug products . i not disappointed , neither my daughter . pieces large , bright not terribly complex . my daughter needed quite bit help due complex image , but that not bad thing . i got teach her patience , plus watch her work complex problem learn spatial thinking skills . , since since she loves animals , i tell she won't get tired puzzle(s ) quite some time . even after she it herself , chance remains teach interesting/uncommon animals depicted . one small issue -- probably just me -- what i expected pieces made . all my other md purchases solid wood items my 2-year old . some reason , i assumed these would too . instead , they cardboard , albeit good solid material . i made mistake starting out floor , then worrying pieces getting stepped snapped . all all , this aforementioned rain forest puzzle , same high caliber i've come trust melissa doug . i'll buying their remaining similar puzzles	1

i shocked how big this horse stable ! i run out buy bigger horses ! i bought melissa doug horses - 12 wooden box after seeing stable i thought those horses way too small ! now we family horses stable . quality stable excellent ! worth every penny ! it not cheap or flimsy . i can't say enought good things . seller excellent ! i ordered it last minute christmas gift they got it here record time !!!!!	1

i purchased this item reasonable expectations . i wanted it move forward backward able drive my blacktop driveway maybe even my grass little . it barely moves . my daughter average size 3 year old so she not weighting it down . its main issue battery . it takes 18-30 hours charge - that minimum day half , yet if you get 30 minutes drive time you lucky . even then , it moves so slowly its crawl - hardly 2.5 mph promised , forget 5mph . also , plastic rather thin so i doubt it hold up any inadvertant taps . think twice this - it might cute but it doesn't move worth shoot	-1

we've great time playing this game . i would not recommend this anyone under age 14 . idea fool your opponent complex definitions or believable ideas . it would tough keep up adults table , this respect . happy playing .	1
i started playing boulder dash back 1996 since then it become one my favourite games . there no limit number players participate game . actually more playing more fun it . you not know meaning words fun . what you need wild imagination good skills bluffing . game now includes more categories such dates , initials movie titles but still word category i think best . if cards provided box finished no problem you use scrap paper honestly i never used board game while playing . ready rounds loud laughs why not ready enrich your vocabulary words you never use anyway !	1
my 4 1/2 yr old really likes this toy . back area , " cargo " hold not stay together well , doors fall down . if your child easily frustrated , i wouldn't recommend it . otherwise , it fun looks really cool	-1

my 5yr old son loves this toy , he always loved build things . but most educational toys 5-6yr old needs some guidance . this isn't kind toy you just plop your kid down front walk away ( see " playdoh " ) , they'll just end up hating it . you need take time show them how it works , what they it , pretty soon they'll get hang it , bonus you get spend quality time your kid . everyone talks quality time vs . quantity time use it excuse spend less time their kids . simple truth you cannot spend quality time without spending significant quantity time !!	1
my 6 yr old loves this . he very much into building things blocks , legos , boxes whatever he . best thing he make anything , not just one thing . dad help him putting it together , but it great activity both them . i'm sure time , my son won't need any help . plastic materials safe sturdy . very quality product ! very happy customers here	1
what you this ? oh !!! it stamp ! put some ink bump says lego keep printing it piece paper five-hundred prints saying lego them !!! what fun !!	1
honestly , i found these plates lot cheaper my local meijer store , plus they sale boot . said , you really can't without these baseplates if your child going build anything legos . it bunch fun anyway , seeing how high you make towers , which impossible without one these . they should include these sets how different colors too ? gray green get little boring . you really can't use those colors when you're pretending out desert your big army tanks , now you ? sure wish i could find one those big legos tables - if anyone sees one , please let me know . they would even better investment over these baseplates	1
last year i decided stop collecting barbies i very disapointed big headed dolls showing up like cali girl , fashion fever ect now i see these celebrity dolls regular head size i very pleased this doll so pretty although she doesnt exact likeness i still think she ok outfit wonderfull pretty hair mattel please stop making bigheaded barbies keep making pretty dolls like this one dont mix myscene regular doll line	1

" or " which animal says " moo " ? " , or " find orange cat " . it respond animal sound , voice saying " this orange cat " . our son gets them all every time ! we haven't used spanish setting , though our son loves flip it , then he no idea what voice saying , but he keeps doing it anyway ! great toy , well worth money	1

my daughter received this birthday gift thrilled when she saw box . however , after taking pieces out putting them together , putting them together , then putting them together again , she lost all interest it . she loves 2 cats movie most excited they included . wedding arch falls apart if you look it wrong . i would not spend my money this unless you intend sit there your child reconstruct thing every time she moves .	-1
i am satisfied product . kids enjoy it . only thing i noticed picture web box , show part shoots ball down lane made partially metal . i guess changed ball shooter all blue plastic now . it works fine though , so it not really issue . i'd recommend rack roll bowl	-1
much needed our rc car . we purchased rc car unable find battery pack store . result we purchase normal aa while we searched out battery pack . after 2 days replace batteries 3 times we told our son wait till this came . it great once it got car . like others said car worked much better . it faster , more powerful , lot more fun my husband son . it lasted hour then just died when it lost power . excellent product .	1

my son loved his r.c dirtbike . it rides really well esp . dirt asphalt but broke first day he played it . sad him	-1
first all , it not toy , it hobby plane i agree people who say it not 10 year olds . every one who wrote bad review either too impatient fly it didn't read instructions which say it pro level plane fly it , you need read instructions or you'l regret it or they're just not good pilots . my experience storm launcher excelent . you need drive it ground first 8- 10 times so motors get used it . then , before flying , you need some small jumps practice . before you know it , you fly it almost 6 minutes loops .	1
products made almost entirely flimsy styrofoam . pieces break every time it used . plenty glue packing tape available keep it together . you need buy separate battery charger $30.00 - which doesn't last all long . all all - its $100.00 tissue - you blow it once its trash .	-1
i just recieved this game yesterday i love it . first time i played it i won million dollars , bad it wasn't real . thing i like this game unlike some other hand held ones i played you turn it off , it little blue button top turns it off . it save your game too if you turn it off some reason , which me great cause i 4 little kids don't always let me sit very long . i got electronic game too but haven't played it yet , i like watch show but i love play game , i got tired playing it website so i purchused this see if it funner it .	1
i can't praise this product without stepping toes 40 other reviews ! i'll just say my 5 year old daughter big dinosaur buff she knows her stuff . she nature videos , books , everything ! she thinks this set a-okay . she loves setting up " dinosaur land " bright colored mat comes , too . my 2 year old son , who not " paleontologist " my daughter also loves playing these cool dinosaurs .	1

well worth extra money this game format . purchased closable travelling soap dish cards , better ziploc� bags chips - throw everything into tube . read some comments flexible board curling gave some hesitation going this route . this solved rolling board printing outside , so when board unrolled natural temporary edge curl downwards . only possible negative tube not handy travelling or storag	1

this too difficult my 5-year old work . initially i couldn't get it work ... it took 20 minutes rubbing get it lick . now i get it work much faster ( 5 minutes ... still pretty long child ) rubbing extrememly hard fast . first tongue not wet , but eventually after getting it work several times , it become wet ( guess it takes while water work its way into tongue ? ) . don't waste your money or disappoint your child	-1
this good toy keeping your brothers sisters out your room all times so get this if you don't want anybody going taking anything out your room !!!!!!!!!	1
i high hopes this game , but unfortunately , this product average best . use dvd slow game questions limited how many times you land wedge before it stops giving questions tells you just ask deck . also questions lame , what faze moon it when golum climbed down cliff eming mul ' ( sp ? ) , what color someone dress particular scene , how many days gimili , aragon , legolas track hobbits ? who cares , questions movie making even worse , really .	-1
we bought this trike our daughter first birthday . she loves it ! she little small reach pedals but she loves hang onto handle bar swing her legs . only issue i trike there no seatbelt . if you getting it older child , it doesn't matter but we made seatbelt camera strap help hold smaller kids seat	-1
my son received this trike christmas present his grandparents . he only 14 months old , but big his age , any case he cannot pedal yet . best features trike it easy mom or dad steer , it seat strap , its just plain cooler than going walk stroller . my son loves it anytime he gets peek it he points it squeals , if we don't let him ride it he gets upset . he feels like big boy , especially since he always sees older kids our neighborhood their bikes . features you live without include sun shade , which i haven't noticed actually blocking any sun , cup holder which doesn't really work out well , slightest turn drink tips spills . this only detracts slightly overall impression trike , but you could save some money buying model without useless sunshade . seat doesn't seem adequate five year old , which age trike supposed used until . i don't think we'll use it much past three years , but all all it sturdy little trike my son loves it	1

this one games my friends i played death . it very fun simple , yet some mathematical skills probabilities doesn't hurt . purpose game fill your score sheet much possible making different combinations required . more you higher score , multiple yahtzee ( five kind ) scores you bonuses . there different editions this game but this one best . here why : redesigned : this edition yahtzee comes felt-lined cup tray . remember how loud it use plastic cup original edition ? well now it very quiet tray keeps dice going everywhere . dice over size which nice touch . it also dice keeper where you place dice you not re-roll . playing materials : folio comes score pad engraved pencil . but it also room store more pencils pads . you even store triple yahtzee pad if you any . triple yahtzee kind yahtzee advanced isn't sold anymore although you still find scoring pads instructions net ( which all you need ) . portable : you drag this game anywhere . since you play solo it great take your doctor appointment . if you don't mind people asking where you got cool yahtzee game . it perfect travel zippered case very nice durable . overall game great this folio edition must buy any yahtzee fan . way i saw someone once roll three yahtzees row finish ten yahtzees six round game . i know you better ... if you try . fun !	1
i loved clue growing up , so when my mother asked me gift ideas my 8-year-old son , i suggested clue jr. among other board games geared his age , he received clue jr. christmas present thrilled . ( he likes mysteries just like his mom ! ) unfortunately , our glee short-lived . my brother girlfriend , her 12-year-old son , my son , i sat down play this game . my brother girlfriend read instructions , we tried figure out what color coded stickers -- how even begin play . now , let me just say both us board game aficionados who played zillions games clue our day . i genius iq she pediatric nurse . short , we ain't stupid . yet , even mid-game , we hard time figuring out how move game pieces , how discover clues mark off checklist , so . you see , each player not specific game piece regular clue . instead , you peel off small stickers place under white bases ( green " crumb " label indicating culprit five time labels ) yellow drink labels five yellow bases . then , you roll color-coded die determine if you should look under yellow furniture pawn , under white character pawn , or move any character forward up number rolled dice . if character lands yellow space , look bottom furniture piece that room ( example , plant patio ) . then , secretly look under furniture pawn that next room . even now , i'm re-reading instructions , i'm hard time understanding what ! ( so it doesn't make easy reviewing , let alone playing ! ) not only , there not lot room game board putting furniture pieces beside room ... let alone it ! we so frustrated bored all four us agreed quit -- play pictionary jr. , instead . if you're feeling nostalgic tempted buy clue jr. child , resist urge . you'll wasting your money time my opinion . ( we're returning game this weekend , fact . ) pieces chintzy , game play confusing , it doesn't even come pencils	-1
my 2 sons 3 1/2 5 years old they both absolutely love this game . we play it everyday . they never seem get bored it .	1
my son received this set his eighth birthday . it frustrating him , well myself , first rods really pushed hard into balls order your creations not fall apart easily . afer hours working set we found it truly contagious . he made some really amazing quot ; buildingsquot ; never wants dismantel them so 900+ piece set very handy . i hard time seeing price value this product . it appears very inexpensive product manufacture it sells fairly steep price	1
this excellent game but it much better cities knights expansion . i haven't tried seafarers expansion yet , but i would imagine would add dimension added fun level . ( although manual note only certain scenarios seafarers added cities knights due fact it would too hard protect against barbarian attacks fully explore sea)the neat thing this game island different every time due island tiles shuffled upside down before they turned over placed . players start game placing settlements roads near resource tiles . tiles covered randomly drawn numbers people receive resources based whether number their resource tile rolled dice . goal game attain 10 pts before anyone else building more roads , cities or armies ( this harder than it sounds ) . fighting each other really not element this game . army built drawing " soldier " cards more these cards than other people . biggest component this game bartering . some people more one kind resource than others , everyone needs cooperative some level bargaining order build . key not helping your opponent too much while not making enemy . my niece who 7 years old able pick up rules catan right away . knights expansion probably take her little longer but i see no problems her able play her own eventually . if i remember correctly , i think box says game takes 2 hours . it takes my family more like 3-4 hours play game . learning rules knights expansion turned game into 8 hour game , but i am sure now we know rules it go down back 3-4 hour game . biggest downside this game how critical it beginning choose where place your settlements . depending what numbers rolled most next resources determine who gets most resources . this lean advantage more towards certain players . there also things called development cards which purchased resources which add component game . they used steal resources other players , build roads without spending resources , etc . game pieces made wood , island tiles made sturdy cardboard . this enjoyable game , but far simpler than i expected , i enjoyed added dimensions knights expansion because it added barbarian attacks against island ability purchase knights protect island . knights also chase robber away block others roads . there also more interesting cards drawn ( progress cards ) add more action game . it seems easier get more resource cards . overall , there just seems lot more ways win game much more action each hand . there lot rules expansion it little challenging first remember all them , but regardless , i would still buy knights expansion right away this game . expansion i would rate this over 5 stars .	-1
my kids their friends love playing this game . it game strategy	1
really 0 ( zero ) stars but not option . this game awful dvd player but found if you could keep it freezing up x-box , it moved little quicker ... until it froze . what wrong it ? i don't think i read one good review wished i investigated before buying second one after thinking maybe i just got bad one first time . why everyone buy two ?	-1
past 4 months , we played this twice . it poor graphics slow response time . i really didn't expect whole lot price , but pictures grainy hardly recognizable . it isn't exciting my daughter learns more watching show . i am disappointed since i really hoped little better this kind game .	1
i bought this item my 3 year old daughter she loves it . her room one her less favorite places house , until this game arrived . it so many different cool adventures she can't seem put it down , it keeps her entertained hours . this game includes : dig dig dig .. tunnel through dirt stones reach bottom before swiper fox . steer clear reaaly big rocks ! river river race adventure .. how quickly you race swiper fox down river ? saltador , jumping star help you jump over frogs , crocodiles whirlpools . rainbow balloon race ... sail across sky rescuing stars butterflies swipers bubble machine . avoid grumpy rain clouds way ! puzzle bridge repair ... oh , no ! swiper fox remove pieces bridge mix them up . you help return each piece ?. cool thing this game up 4 players play help solve puzzles , win races stop swiper fox . this game early childhood intended children 5 older . my 3 year old her 10 9 year old sisters her side help her way . this game definately worth it i would highly recommend all who thinking purchasing one . this definately going one most requested christmas so dont wait till it sold out buy now	1
other than larger than i would liked , this toy fantastic . my 2.5 year old obsessed pushing buttons . remotes , cell phones , you name it . we've trying teach him alphabet since he year old , limited success . child doesn't doesn't attention span anything we've tried ( flash cards , drawing , associating words , etc ) . he'd watch dvds like leap frog letter factory , but there still no visable improvement . we picked up little kiddie laptop during our time here holland , but it only speaks dutch . we realized while nothing we helping , he getting very good dutch version alphabet ( same letters , different sounds most ) engrossed this laptop . my husband i talked it nostalgia brought up old speak ' spells we children 80s . we soon found out they discontinued , so i came amazon hunt something similar found this produc t.t wo weeks ownership later my son now very good not only recognizing alphabet , but also words it teaches basic shapes . i actually heard machine praising over over again last night went searching my son my husband , who i certain helping him . imagine my surprise when my son sitting alone doing it all himself . i so terribly proud impressed . we've put piece tape over speaker , note , because it terribly loud no volume control , but it small price pay how much it taught my child so little time	1
my nephew loved his puzzle . it shape farm peices huge so he no touble manipulating them . he just turned 3 so it little difficult him but we put it together 7 times row after he opened it christmas	1

i am so seriously disappointed this version spirograph . old model squire long popsicle type disk several other drawing disks . problem this model prongs not hold disks place very well . this causes disk slide under drawing stencil . oh you only three different drawing stencils/outlines unlike old model . when i young my sister ( who 9 years older than me ) i loved this " toy " we would draw literally hours . it cool every age group ! i so excited see this " deluxe " version . my son frustrated this model one minute so i tried it out i gave up after few tries well . honestly , i ( 40 year old lady ) bought it myself just pretended it my son . although , this not expensive toy .... it not worth your money ... it truly not work well .... i am really sad !	-1
this probably one best cubes out there . i personally am experienced 3x3x3s , 4x4x4s , 5x5x5s , this one definitely my list favorites . tiles definitely superior regular stickers , allowing one very versatile when cubing . this cube not only beginners but those who very experienced speed-cubers . i wish i started out this cube , but i definitely love it now	1
what makes this monopoly version special large tokens difeerent styles houses hotels . i love how they made tokens bigger heavier . also four different styles houses hotels little variety housing . money holder felt it make it little more fancy then standard plastic course case metal instead standard cardboard box . other than it same game . only complaint i i thought looking tin shelf it silver gld colored tin , but it only siver . gold only plastic around tin .	-1

my parents bought this my 2.5 year old daughter this year christmas , she loves it ! my husband put it together 45 minutes drill . it not huge so it doesn't take up tons room . our living room good size it fits nicely corner . it lots sounds little pretend stove phone really cute . my daughter loves running out it , shutting her door shutters . two childrens would easily fit this . i fit it well . i think this provide hours imaginitive play . overall i would rate this excellent buy	1
i bought this my twin 2 year old girls this past summer , set it up thier bedroom . house great quality , like all little tikes , pieces fit together nice snug . few screws here there , bam house thier bedroom . house rather large , but my girls didn't play it too long , but they spoiled . it large enuff i climb inside then they wanna play . door get ripped off within first hour play , so i just left it off . still great toy , i am now thinking adding 8 " padded board across bottom now open door , filling house plastic balls(like chucky-cheese ) .	1

we large group friends gets together regular basis our usual game choice 80 or 90 game ! we play ' guys against girls ' , usually we make guys answer 80 questions girls answer 90 questions . ( i think 80 questions little harder just because you think back whole decade ! )if you lucky roller you really get ahead game using " free jump " . also , if guys land sports questions too much they usually end up beating girls . best part these games questions aren't too serious or too impossible like trivial pursuit . if you lived 80 or 90 , you should know answers - hard ( but fun ) part just trying remember ! ladies , you remember song joey mcintyre ( former nkotb ) came out solo 1999 ? i recommend buying both games - its fun intermix questions ! fun , fun , fun	1
if you're like my friends me spent your teens early 20 90 , you'll love this game . great questions dealing music , movies , tv , events , sports . great thing most questions really make you think bit ( it not super-easy no-brainer like some other games out there ) . we set up 3 teams 2 game took hour , hour half ( obviously , more teams = longer playing time ) . this game definitely staple all our gaming nights . sure bet	-1
after torrential rains june , i bought 90 game this summer rainy day activity my beach house . but we didn't just play 90 game rainy afternoons , my housemates itching play this game when they woke up , beach before going out night . 90 game fun game groups -- never dull moment , even if you didn't watch every re-run 90210 melrose place ! everyone dominate least some categories -- whether you music buff , sports fiend , movie aficionado or tv nut -- but it never too easy win , nor too difficult cause boredom	1
my father made me some wooden dolls furnature when i younger . i wanted pass it down my daughter ( now 4 ) but needed house few new pieces furnature . my daughter loves house , its perfect size preschooler ( more complex house may come bit later ) . rooms open its easy make it however she wants ( we actually attatched garage it , but she uses it bathroom or bedroom ) . its very bright beautiful , most pieces large sturdy enough 4 year old handle ( some smallest most complex little things i couldnt even handle ) . there arent any stairs ( really bothers her , we still studying it see if few adjustments could made :) . i love house sturdy alows fun play ( even my 10 month old twins " play " it)the people ridiculously cheap . they felt soon fall apart . my daughter makes them " nextdoor neighbors " ( which usually ends up annoying or bad guy family ) . most other sets wont fit ( ie loving family little people dont fit well , although we old hand-me-down plastic house downstairs . furnature held up surprizingly well , but we many other pieces my old house , so they dont get much " action " . they also really hurt if you step them , but goes most any house ... all all i love house , hate people , think furnature mediocor quality ... pretty good buy , but maybe not ideal choice child over age 5-6	-1

pretty expensive but i ended up splurging getting it my 8 year old nephew this coming christmas . i ended up giving it him this weekend instead ; i wanted see it go too couldn't wait 4 months ! my nephew really likes it but , oy !, video bad -- what they show online commercial quite bit clearer contrasty than what we see our actual unit . i think infrared aspect blurs things bit its sensitivity pretty low any case . you can't read any writing thru video , regardless size print , etc . still , video link minimally serviceable ( adequate manuevering little bit practice ) my nephew big time sitting his " command center " sending it out " remote missions " using only onboard video link . seems fairly robust sturdy so far	-1
we bought this our daughter right after she began crawl . she absolutely loved it . several key points : 1)she truly enjoyed feedback she would get when she would make basket . especially if others room cheered game . then she would really start hammin ' it up ! great self esteem ! 2)the baseball component her least favorite first but once she got hang it i noticed her concentration unbelievable ! she determined hit ball if it last thing she would . excellent hand-eye coordination . 3)the football wasn't most interactive part game , especially our daughter aged , but when she younger sound motion certainly stimulating her developing mind but no way overwhelming her . 4)yes whole set small but if consumers read box they see it not meant taller more mobile children not height adjustable . little tikes other products meet those needs . this great toy crawlers , those pull themselves up standing , early walkers . we would buy this again heartbeat far our daughter favorite toy her transition infancy toddlerhood . we planning getting adjustable hoop christmas hope she enjoys it much !	1
my son recieved this gift 6 months . even though it rated 9 months up , he enjoyed it still enjoys it . here what we like it : 1 . he likes spinning football unassisted , even while sitting . i spun it him once he " got " it right away . it something he sitting without help . 2 . he likes sounds/music when you put ball through hoop , even though he couldn't it seated , he loved it when we'd hold him up let him dunk ball . 3 . he loves bat , though he not able connect bat ball just yet , he likes banging floor bat . 4 . even tough he can't hit baseball bat , he likes pushing ball hearing clicking noise . 5 . it definitely helped hand-eye coordination he learned drop ball into hoop or put it hole . it also some cause effect , because now he drops ball knows where look it . 4 . unlike roll-a-rounds toys , which we generally like , basketballs just right size him pick up one hand . here what not great : 1 . it fairly large , but not heavy/stable enough him pull himself up or rely standing ( now he ) . he almost pulled it over several times trying this . 2 . it really hard put together , even though there no screws , etc . it basically " snapped " together , but me , my husband his best friend all fight get pieces place . 3 . sometimes basketball doesn't push lever all way register basket . while my son can't count doesn't know score hasn't updated , he likes sound , so i end up hitting it my hand , which he now started copy . overall i give this 4 stars . he enjoying it almost 3 months now , i anticipate it continue one his favorite toys	-1

ok , i'm waaayyyy too old writing pogo sticks . but i'm hooked , so here goes ... if you going spend big bucks pogo stick , then you should take good look what available . yes , this one cool it very good . but dig deeper before buying . this particular pogo stick designed vurtego/etoy ** cheaper ** version their top-of-the-line sticks ( pro series , " ultra " series ) . if you like this specific design you plan drop significant dinero stick , why not get one versions higher quality components ? , since company makes stick 2 sizes , why not track down one provides best fit your needs ? design this stick bit unusual . it doesn't use spring like time-honored sticks , it doesn't use sling-shot surgical tubing like flybar sticks . it uses large air cylinder , which you inflate you would bicycle tire or bouncing ball ( using air compressor or bike pump ) . so feel not necessarily what you'd expect . this not bad thing , but it definitely doesn't feel springy like old sticks . it really more like brisk bounce , like super ball . when you switch jumpers ( e.g. , if you skinny your friends weigh ton ) , it drag make adjustments . then again , it wasn't really possible make adjustments old sticks . i strongly recommend xpogo extreme pogo website source information . they up-to-date reviews all pogo sticks market , members ' comments each sticks . if you thinking buying stick , consider one flybar products ( 1200 , soon-to-be released 800 ) , motostik , or one other vurtego products .	-1

we bought this toy our nine year son . i say , we expected whole lot more . while frog internal organs interesting , reasonably true life , there no schmatic diagram any kind . so , once child " dissected " frog removed organs , it matter guesswork how they go back . more like just fitting them best you rather than really understanding how various pices/organs fit back into frog . it would far more useful if there schematic diagram which child could follow reassemble internal organs . such this turned out " play it once " then put it shelf item . too bad it great idea . just needs bit more terms directives	-1

this 500-in-1 kit more features than average attention span handle ( i won't re-hash list here . you find complete list projects online somewhere ) . so , this not " well , this looks like good gift johnny " product . whoever going receive ( if it gift ) or purchase themselves , should fairly serious learning electronics . if not , start much smaller kit , work yourself up this one . far construction , it pretty sturdy . breadboard centrally located layout perspective , i no trouble setting up any experiments . ****** note ******* there ton resistors , wires , caps , etc . i ended up buying couple plastic partitioned containers hold everything still wasn't enough . pretty much everything comes individually marked plastic bag , tesla help you if you don't take care replacing everything back into correct baggie , or you'll quickly memorize resistor identification chart ... though , may not bad side-effect :) ********************* i some trouble breadboard itself , some slots really tough punch into my big sausage-like fingers , i ended up bending few leads wire ends here there settled using some needle nose pliers feed tough slots . experiments split up into 3 large softbound manuals ( aprox 10 " x14 " ) cover very wide range projects . there " you know " type blurbs throughout which makes them informative . ****** note ******* my biggest problem this kit text experiments . i found myself wanting more " this what happening why " type information , but what you get mostly just how set up project . imho , it missing 1 or 2 more paragraphs talking why project . ********************** ironically , most use i actually got out this kit , prototype test some circuts devices ( motors , lights , solenoids , etc ) using breadboard variable resistor pots , but i've since purchased breadboard r.s. some basic wires/resistors/caps/etc allow me all . my add only allowed me trek through first manual before i saw shiny object left this kit gather dust closet . if you serious using kit learn electronics , then this probably you . if you looking it hobby view , i'd recommend starting something smaller . ( sorry long review , but since no one else submited one , i figured i'd try some help )	-1

fabulous twist your average trivia game . one player reader , announces category card rest players . most cards 2 categories - example " characters lord rings : two towers countries belong nato " . reader chooses start player , players take turns naming things they think list . reader uses nifty little device mark correct answers . first player give incorrect answer gets 3 point chip ; next 2 wrong answers get 2 point chip , last few wrong answers get 1 point chip . once all items guessed or all chips gone , round over . each player moves forward number spaces equal their chip value , except smarty pants , person who gave last correct answer - they get throw away one chip . next reader person last place . game ends when one or more players goes over end line board ; winner player closest start . forget trivial pursuit - this much more fun . plus , who wouldn't love game comes pair rubber pants	1
built this my son . toy falls over when heavy machanical piece set top unstable base causing major destruction destroying hours work . bad design . also missing pieces needed finish	-1

i wish i read reviews before i purchased this item my 2 year old . others discovered , ramp fell apart immediately !!!! it looks nice , but isn't actually much fun play - there nothing connecting levels other than clunky elevator , which makes it difficult access vehicles	-1
pictures concept very enticing , but stick lego playmobil durability . imaginext set we purchased hard 6yr old assemble . pieces don't stay together easily , so right now it pieces all over floor . not much fun 6-yr old long run not fun mom !	-1
i got this recently christmas . first i thought all you could play , feed groom you pet . i very wrong . i all plus you walk around seeing other digital pets you listen radio , dance others , connect your digital pet , collect stamps play games . i love this toy it not rip off ! best price i seen it 15 dollars	1
we really enjoyed this game . my dad , me my 4-year-old played together , figuring out solutions . i admit it bit hard my 4-year-old but she ready this eventually ( meantime we play together ) . i would buy one my 6-year-old niece . i wish there replacement pieces now i am little apprehensive losing one essential logs included . instructions easy playing fun ! highly recommended .	1
this game seems quite difficult first , but becomes easier once you realize exactly what rules allow . my 4 year old 7 year old kids enjoyed it short time , but unable grasp complexities past first few levels quickly lost interest ( not surprising this below manufacturer age limit ) . i'm sure older kids would find this fun . adults this game quite addictive , after few days i able solve all 40 levels . if you look inventor site [ ... ] you find much harder plank puzzles . however my 4 star rating mostly because 40 included cards just bit too easy master . " equipment gripe " there exactly minimum number plastic " logs " required cover all games no extras . we now lost one two shortest logs over half puzzles require two these so these can't played any more ( you try substituting other items but real logs fit nicely magnets inside them which quite helpful playing game ) . fortunately thinkfun offers extra game pieces fee ( see their web site ) . i now river crossing 2 , but without missing piece i can't really play it .	-1
my 8 month old son received this book christmas gift . he loves it . it really keeps his attention . he enjoys looking all books but this one especially . page tabs make it easy him turn pages his own . songs interactive pieces educational well . i would definitely recommend this product	1

tamagotchis awesome ! when i first introduced tamagotchi , i wasn't very interested it until my friend borrowed one classmate . she played jump-rope over over over over - well , you get my point . she loved it ! after watching her play it over over over , well , i got interested . " i wonder how she got glued little video game thing . i'd better find out . " i thought . so when i wal-mart my mom brother , i selected 2 tamagotchis toy section . after i played it while , i thought , " these really cool ! monday i tell my friend i one . " before we got one , my mom said my brother could too . " what ?! no way ! those girls ! " he said . but when he played ... " where my tamagotchi ? i play it please ??? dad , you what cool tamagotchi ? " all i heard him . he never consentrated his homework ! i especially like infra-red communication	1
my son loves this ! keeps him occupied long time . his little friends think it awesome when they come play day ! there enough room several children play together . seems under priced ... yet putting it together makes up it ! fyi ... if this gift santa , his elves assemble it before it goes under tree . not hard , just takes little time go faster without excited child waiting play ... i rate this 5 stars fun price but 3 assemly	-1
i very skeptical after reading reviews , but i ordered it anyway , we gave it our son christmas 2005 . he loves it ! i warned my husband what i read how people said it so hard put together . i however , know my husband , he very good way , he no trouble all . i suprised how easy it . it daunting looking millions pieces we opened box but they went together very easily also came apart if we needed . out son loves it , reason i afraid people said , reviews once again , you must find ' mission select " rescue heroes no other ones work . they not readily available stores , not way readily available . so i trusted reviews bought them ebay . but reviews wrong , you not need mission select rescue heroes . you need ' talking ' rescue heroes which readily available toys rus else where . i think amazon it marked , when we bought it , (...) because so many people gave it bad reviews , it bargain our son even uses other people animals it , elevator . he endless fun it . it sparked his imgination .	1
my son this toy year still plays it . he other three r.h. command centers ( older blue tower aquatic command center ) . he loves use them all his missions . it took some time put together but expected . luckily , my son already most mission select action figures , truck police car before getting this center . they hard find stores , but most still found ebay . keep mind , this not include any figures . it keeps him busy still keeps his attention after all this time . we bought it sale it back sale so it worth price any rescue hero fan . great addition this center dvd " rescue heroes : movie " it all mission select guys it this command center seen so after watching he play m.a.c.c. act out missions . this great all rescue hero fans	-1

my daughter got this set her first birthday . all kids enjoyed playing it , it held up extremely well . it appears very heavy-duty , ready years wear tear . only flaw i see , compared other sets , tunnels not attach center section - they just fit inside openings . this makes easy set up , but they also come apart too easily , making center collapse . one rambunctious youngster made game tearing set apart . when my toddler falls against either center or tunnel , they become disconnected . if i hadn't already destroyed packaging , i'd return it set uses velcro ( like playhut ) attach tunnels tents	1
i wish i could give this cube 5 stars ! if it based how much our twins adored toy , i would definitely give it better rating ! however , i feel need mention we initially purchased this toy our 6+ mos old twins within few months battery cover cracked right next on/off switch , leaving batteries easily accessible . duct tape would not even keep cover securely , because cover under so much pressure batteries springs underneath . when our twins 1 1/2 we decided put it christmas wish list , because they both adored first one so much . much our dismay , exact same thing happened battery cover second one ! what huge disappointment ! obviously this toy manufacturing defect i only hope munchkin fixes it future production toy . concept excellent our twins really love it , especially our very musical little girl .	-1

this deluxe version monopoly in-cre-di-ble . sometimes we play it so much we stop don't play it ages , but after few months we play it this deluxe version made playing it so much easier . first , wooden houses hotels . they lot more fun use much easier handle . they're not hollow look real nice , even if they're not so detailed plastic ones . second , gold pieces . pieces absolutely elegant their simple designs their beautiful shiny gold . not real gold , but it makes them all look incredible ! plus , their extra token . it train token , i find it one my favorite tokens now . ( money bag also included)third , banker tray . some people may not like this if they too used taking money out individual trays , but this keeps money together much easier . their slot where you insert money like you would drop envelope drawer , you take it out easily . plus , it three little compartments houses , hotels , small one tokens dice . it really wonderful . fourth , propert carousel . if you ever got angry keeping properties order , you don't need anymore . it small turntable slots each property including railroads utilities . you spin it around whenever you're searching particular one . it extremely handy , you spin it very easily it never wears out . ( if you take out all properties spin turntable smooth surface , it spin ages :-) ) fifth , community chest chance cards not paper . they're now plastic cards coloring their pictures . it looks real shiny new , they're much easier shuffle handle . board also large specially colored rich uncle pennybags middle deluxe edition below him gold letters . really gives whole thing brand new work .

this book so beautiful outside it pity words so incredibly hurtful wrong . story fish who covered beautiful scales . fish comes up asks given one scales beautiful fish says no , after which none other fish play it . fish advised someone " wise " give away its beautiful scales so other fish like it . it follows advise gives every other fish scale so end book page filled bunch pathetic looking fish all one shiny scale everyone supposedly happy . me this terrible moral ! it wrong prettier or smarter or more talented some way ? you should try make yourself less pretty or dumber or ignore your talents so other people won't jealous ? it ok demand other people give you things you covet ? yuk !	-1
" long way out deep blue sea there lived fish . not just ordinary fish , but most beautiful fish entire ocean .

yes it more expensive than rest . but quality overall ease use worth every cent . my 4 year old daughter tall her age , so multi positional handle great . pram easy her set up use , also reclining back rest foot rest when used stroller easy manipulate . we many people stop us ask where it came . it also easy fold down put car trunk ( my daughter takes it her when we go shopping ) . i also purchased " cheaper " pram , it headed return desk . basket underneath worth its price gold . if your child into babies , this pram last many years	1
i bought this my son 3 years ago when he 1 . he played hard it 2 years i stored it away year . i just pulled it out my 1 year old daughter , washed it it looks amazing . thinking back abuse tent tunnel took amazaing shape it compelled me write this review . there periods time it left outside weeks . it withstood many playdates . there not so much tear it . hightly recommend !	1
our one year old really enjoys this . we ended up disconnecting tunnel , it took up quite bit space . though when we place it room , our son sit hang out tunnel . many his toys end up tent him we always enjoy disembodied sounds	-1
my husband i love play boggle so we excited find boggle jr share our kids . we couldn't even finish playing one time . this not game . you don't roll dice or play any way . this " learning " activity , but it isn't fun all . i am very disappointed this	-1
i agree " game " more learning vs playing per directions . however , little creativity fun , educational time . newest version i play my 3.5 year old son us splitting dice taking turns rolling our dice goal getting one word letters . he fun rolling searching his lot even if he doesn't roll needed letter . plus he easily handle 4 dice . when you roll " needed " letter you place it its place . player who fills last letter " wins " gets spell out say word . sometimes we make up our own songs winning word . this version easily keeps him happy half hour time he also played his own take his own .	1
when i first played this game party friends , i couldn't wait get copy my own . it around christmas stores all out so online places . i waited patiently until it became available now i my own copy . it great ! lots laughs very fun parties ! i highly recommend it	1
this game like apples apples , but even more fun ! we played it over christmas ages 13- adult everyone loved it !!	1
i love teaching my friends this game ! it two players you pay attention four different variables . it simple concept , but challenging . i like wood pieces - it not your average board game	1

i got my nephew spongebob leapster christmas . i asked my sister how he ? she told me he got so excited so thankful i got him leapster which he only 2 half years old . i informed he already graduated spongebob only 5 8 years old . i would rate this any child use not just ability age but under limit age able repeat hear them often they build their intelliegent . i can't wait get him more leapster . he already asking more leapster stuff . i must say he leaster freak plays it all day long	1

ropes cheap , while strong , make swing sit angle swing not straight , but eliptical figure eight pattern	-1
my daughter loves swing , this product wonderful . we bought when she 9 months , 2.5 we decided it time move up into something just front bar so it easier get her out it . she grown , her shoes tend get caught when getting her out swing . last summer sanadals pain . overall this great product . she enjoys it , we feel like she secure swing .	1
my mother got this toy my 3 year old daughter today . she dora dollhouse plays daily . we even travel everywhere people furniture . she loves rescue center we played it all afternoon . it comes little dora , little diego , baby jaguar , baby bear , bed jaguar , jeep pull out map . me map seems kind pointless but my daughter singing map song moving dora trail . one best parts this it actually comes baby bear . my daughter likes act out meet diego story everyone but bear . i also love unlike house all pieces stored inside it , when closed it stays closed it handle traveling . while she thrilled this i really wish it bigger . dora diego pretty much size my thumb probably not good idea child still puts things into their mouth . however , she could care less what size they uses both little dora diego dollhouse dora diego . i honestly wish fisher price would make this bigger so dollhouse people could used it more animals some sort jungle vine diego could swing . i would glady pay 2-3xs price this if it bigger . i really recommend this though size not seem matter my daughter it really adorable .	1

there many " versions " available anakin skywalker ep 3/luke skywalker ep 4 5 force fx light saber . this version , episode 3 saber , one most elegant . hilt near-exact replica movie prop , only very slightly wider longer than authentic hilt , accomodate circuitry/electronics/batteries . one " newer generation " fx sabers , it only requires 3 aa batteries . sturdy polycarbonate blade brilliant blue . power-up , idle hum , clashing sounds loud crisp , total package inspires imagination . alas , hilt design weight not make this saber easiest spin , location power switch sometimes makes it prone accidentally turning off blade while manuevering or spinning saber . minor drawback one most eclectic force fx sabers ; this saber transcends trilogies , if you , passed fallen chosen one his son , hope he would redeemed ...	-1
i purchased anakin skywalker model couple months ago very pleased item . hilt well-detailed , maybe too well detailed , proper weight make it feel like real thing . blade very bright , sounds crisp loud . only problem i saber activation switch : it located right center hilt gets way very easily . you hold saber just right avoid bulbous switch . also , it very easy accidently turn it off while you're swinging it ( very annoying ) . still , i loved it anyway you learn handle it better almost right away . i loved anakin model so much , i just get one : it toss up mace windu model or darth vader model . i chose dark side . when it arrived ups today , i immediately wanted grab some aa batteries compare two sabers . vader model just bright anakin ( it red , not pinkish ) but noticeably lighter weight . also , digital sound effects different than anakin model ( that good ) , but vader saber not loud , it also takes moment longer power up power down . it should also noted blue anakin model 4 different clashing sounds ..... red vader model only one . again , activation switch right middle hilt which makes it awkward handle first , but you learn cope it . i guess it makes them more " authentic " . however , actual lightsaber props used dramatic fight sequences not activation switches middle hilts ( it would difficult coreograph fight scene those switches way , so they removed give actors nice , smooth surfaces ..... you wouldn't able see switches since their hands covering up most hilts anyway ) . all all , i am very pleased vader model well . i recommend filming yourself pitch-black area then watch it your tv . it looks cool ! they worth price ? my opinion ..... yes , but careful them . they not toys . one more thing : few people reviewing these items say sabers louder when they chash eachother ..... not true . you're simply hearing two clashing sounds once which makes it seem louder . sabers don't any sensors know specifically when saber smacks it anyway . strike strike . next step ..... mace windu saber	1
i owned many lightsabers , but none quite like this . star wars episode iii anakin skywalker lightsaber complete copy vader actual saber . one push ignition blade surges life , illuminating room everything around you . it great item fight , too , if you bored . i suggest buying two them , namely vader anakin models duel . it awesome	1

lot people complaining bumblebee no longer vw bug . hasbro liscencing reasons why they chose not use car , but same time they could chosen not re-release this character new , highly poseable toy too , so don't complain too loudly ... anyway , yes this car no longer looks like bug , but said , original toy lot smaller didn't actually look like cartoon character either . this version toy very well made headsculpt nearly perfect match what we all saw original cartoons . he door shields , just like new optimus , but bumblebees case i feel they better , since optimus kind flop around when you move his arms . bumblebees not . they lock into place very solidly stuck his arms robot mode . my few complaints , reasons i didn't give this toy 5 stars instead fun , he comes silly " waverunner trailer . " i don't know whose idea this , but trailer/waverunner really feel like afterthought toy . more like " gee this toy needs accessory " type addition than something really thought through . quality plastic paint wave runner not same class quality bumblebee figure area where it hooks onto car just look awkward overall . like someone else mentioned he really should just come gun . my second complaint his " knees " which formed two front seats inside car . it really great car front seats adds additional detail which makes vehicle mode look great . however flaps above feet my toy tend get caught under seats when posing , making it occasionally irratating move legs making me worry i might chip paint leg or seat . its minor thing but it coulda fixed just making seat slightly shorter . all all i am very happy this toy , its great addition puts original bumblebee shame	-1

we got this store i work , we all enchanted ! this very first time any us seen set play food young children sushi ! three kinds sushi come shrimp , tuna , salmon roe , egg pieces . proper condiments included : ginger , wasabi , soy sauce , course , chopsticks ! round " dots " sushi rolls velcro , so you stick pieces together slice through them play cleaver , velcro even gives it almost authentic chopping sound ! it just lovely look . all pieces solid wood , beautifully painted . box black details cherry blossoms , it " menu " back restauraunt pretend play ! i plan get one friend child , but i admit i'm really tempted buy one myself , too	1
i love melissa doug toys , they're always well-made always thoughtful . they encourage learning their pieces , made natural material , not only hold up well but environmentally friendly . this game particularly nice example . it classic wooden puzzle twist . each bug magnet it , players given " butterfly net " magnet hanging it use draw pieces out puzzle . one our pieces stick , but quick rub around edges some sandpaper loosened it right up . downside using real materials wood tendency warp humidity or dryness . that downside i'm willing live ! excellent toy	1
i can't say enough these toys ! they so nicely made feel great your hands . small enough carry around big enough little hands . great quality , sturdy superior look . collectors buying these up like hot cakes ebay living proof people willing shell out cash these . especially ones harder find . people written reviews these no stores carry them . they sold out because there rush these toys even before movie release . hopefully time goes if they keep producing them they easier come . that what i am hoping . i don't all characters yet would like least one each my son , maybe even more collecting . good luck your search !	1

this version old fashioned doodle board exceeded my expectations . i purchased it impulsively because our two year old grandson loves both movie " cars " drawing . however , doodle pad larger size than i expected made impressive gift presentation . larger size also makes it easier him draw than he smaller doodle pads .

bought this my 3 year old cousin . he opened few other gifts too , but this only one he played night . he didn't use template , though his 9 year old sister picked it up enough coordination use tracing template . maybe after he plays it while he try template . but mostly he just " drove " car screen draw , not mention driving car all over living room floor well	-1
i bought this my almost three year old daughter already knows her shapes , colors , all her letters . this good reinforcer those skills i like handle portability . only downside this laptop tiny led screen . too bad these toys can't made better screen . tiny square middle barbie picture really ridiculous . i would rate this five if it werent tiny screen	-1
this car great purchase . i bought it my one year old . reason i tired wind up toys make them go and/or drive them backwards so they would go forwards their own . this car awesome because even little kids make it go themselves . literally you just shake it it revs up . more you shake it faster/farther it goes . it go really long way . i ratings toys based required parental invovlement . toys require two hands parent not my favorite only used certain times . this zero hand toy parents - best kind . :) i see him enjoying this car few years	1
i love this little car , i bought it my little cousin he absolutely adores it ! it works like magic , you just shake it it runs , kids seem like it	1
i bought this my nine year old who thought she knew her facts , but couldn't her tests them fast enough . one tell shark exactly what skill test ( example , subtracting " 3 " all one digit numbers random order ) . it sets ten questions ( each one either vertical or horizontal format - one can't specify ) , provides immediate feedback child enters each answer . it asks any incorrrect questions again . once all questions answered correctly , it provides time , example , 43.3 seconds . my daughter enjoys seeing her time get better each time she repeats skill . we agreement she 5 sets each day ( total 50 problems ) . she usually 3 sets same skill , each time gets faster . then she reviews two other skills she already mastered . my only complaint display screen hard see , especially side ( so i can't tell what problems she gets wrong , sitting beside her ) . sometimes she'll get problem wrong because she thinks number something else . i think problem might when led right next edge screen , it shadow or something . you turn off sound ( which isn't all loud anyway ) . i really like how specific you setting level challenge . this valuable tool drilling math getting immediate feedback .	-1
math shark fun play because it helps you learn math . math shark educational kids all age	1
i bought this my 2 1/2 year old , she really loves riding it . it good size her she control it suprisingly well . it alot power when fully charged , i even get back she rides me up down driveway . only thing it not reverse	-1
my daughter 2 years old first i thought it would too big her only find out she able ride it no problems . i also thought it would too fast her since it her first battery operated ride-on . but she proved me wrong . it like treat her . when her dad comes home work he allows her ride it down couple blocks him following quickly beside her . only thing he suggested helmet safety procaution . but she really seems enjoy it we get kick watching her ride it . it came pretty much assembled which really nice avoid fustration putting such large item together . i'm very happy i made choice buy one i strongly recommend it my other family members	1

i picked one up local target today general grievous starfighter droid battle pack , both which i've also written reviews . i'm lovin i t.t his set comes 4 clone trooper minifigs , 2 white , one red , one yellow . markings pretty nice . there only 2 blasters set binoculars four clones , but blasters speeder andgun turret you take off if you need extra . blasters new , shaped like normal clone trooper blaster nicely detailed . speeder cool . it seats two clones , driver gunner . turret really isn't anything special . gun isn't movable , but it larger than other blasters looks cool clone scout . i would swapped turret clone minifig blaster , butthat just me . basically , you get 4 clone troopers , mediocre gun turret , nive speeder just $10 ! it great building clone army since it so cheap , it really cool if you already clone turbo tank or republic gunship . pick few these up , you won't regret it	1

without doubt , flip `n play table chicco my son favorite " baby " toy ! fact , my boy wasn't willing give it up until he 3-years old . i could probably write pages , pages flip `n play table , because it so well loved , developmental qualities endless . i emphasized word " baby " first sentence review , because i think age recommendation could easily altered 9-months up . william 8-months old when he received this table christmas , he needed very little introduction . he played spinning sphere beads , clock spinning hands , because developmentally he wasn't able other activities . sphere rattles makes lots noise , which always entertains little ones . phone , button makes choo choo sounds early favorites too . we didn't use leg supports probably 3-months ; because william wasn't walking yet , i concerned he might fall forward . once he steady his feet , leg support went he would stand , or kneel up toy . then , when he started climbing , he'd climb right inside bin all blocks , play . it cutest thing , although , i put stop because i wasn't comfortable him 13 " off floor even though we carpeting . i'd take legs off table , he'd climb bin while it rested floor . he just happy way , i didn't worry him falling . once he understood lever activated train , he heaven . it makes loud winding sound , which startled him first , but then he enjoyed noise . we'd wind track time , time again . time he started playing shape sorter too . unlike other shape sorters , this one requires you sort shapes properly . there only three shapes , circle , square , triangle so it rudimentary . i think last activities my son able flip book , manipulating rotary dial . he didn't stack blocks quite some time either . he'd play blocks , mostly twirl them floor , bang them together . he almost 2 before he started stacking , building blocks . his first birthday , i added supplementary set , light `n sound circus train , which really added play value this toy . it gave him more blocks stack , since there no stacking order , designs endless . i'm especially satisfied performance flip `n play table . it extremely durable , easy care well . i've placed bin , legs , blocks dishwasher without concern . due mechanisms , tabletop should cleaned damp cloth . chicco make exceptional toys developmental yet , fun . i highly recommend this plaything , chicco line products .	1

my wife i wanted get radio flyer our 4 month old son christmas , but we wanted only best so it could grow him . i researched this alot . this largest wagon radio flyer makes . bottom sides all wooden construction siderails removeable just lifting up them ( although thight fit ) . we though wesley would like ability take sides off little boys love disassemble things . this wagon also pneumatic ( air up ) tires , it came tires inflated . we it put together 30 minutes opening box , although i cordless drill phillips attachment run screws . all holes pre drilled instructions very easy . we found there no stores dallas/fort worth area carried this wagon . rf makes wagon metal base wooden siderails , but sides bolted onto it not easily removable without tools -- we didn't want one . we also disappointed wal-mart target because they only carried plastic wagons seats drink holders our area ... we wanted real wagon . anyway , amazon came through product we wanted , significantly lower cost other online stores time ( we paid $119 , while several places same wagon $150-199 ) delivered it great shape . our 4 month old ... now we prop him up some pillows wagon he loves pulled around ... but i'm sure this wagon still fun when he 10 years old	1
we love this wagon use it instead stroller beach , park , zoo , etc . we also got great deal it costco --- $74.99 !!	1

when i saw this toy toysrus , i thought concept really cute . my 3 year old completely wore out his magna doodles , so he got this few days ago christmas . i really disappointed because erasing takes least 15 strikes back forth , even then it not clear board completely . concept good , it kind like overhead projector little disc you trace . crayola around many , many years . i thought name their history putting out good items kids who love draw , they really missed mark this one . if they little more research , this product could great . i am really disappointed	-1
i got this my 4 5 1/2 year olds . it simple chase game , but after each move you act something out . acting nothing goal game . acting would fun , but my 4 year old wasn't interested acting out card . instead , he always acted out plane . my 5 1/2 year old didn't refinement her movement anyone guess what she doing . there only 6 game pieces , really no reason they choking hazards . since they truly , i keep my 1 year old far away . quality poor . cards flimsy . maybe 6 or 7 year olds would motor skills ... but would they interest	-1

our first foray into leapfrog when our oldest turned three . she both loved learned my first leappad ( ages 3 5 ) we got her . so when she turned four , my mother bought her full-fledged leappad learning system you see here . according box which it came , it suppose age appropriate kids 4 up . compared my first leappad , my daughter finds this version older kids more difficult manage . not so much activities learning activities , but rather larger sized activity pad , activity books not durable , cartridges more difficult four year-old-to handle , basically host other small things . so while my four-year-old use this system when my wife i ( or other adult relatives ) around , her own she prefers my first leappad she finds much more manageable four year old . said , i still give it four stars because some my daughter friends , who year or two older than her , love this this system handle it just fine . also , month-by-month my daughter starting handle this system lot better . anyway , if your child over four you don't version younger kids , it would probably worth it start them this system . if you child only three , however , get my first leappad . if you version younger kids thinking up upgrading this version , wait until your child outgrown first one .	-1
this first leap book my son would read . although he likes idea tad other creatures gladly sit read hour , 3 other books we get maybe 5 minutes his attention . this first one he sit down read/play himself 30 minutes or more ( he super hero obsessed ) . i wanted superman one but after reading reviews it decided this because it read individual words more his level ( just 6 starting 1st grade fall ) . there some great games encourage visual distiction some really interesting facts spiders some good letter sound stuff too . i love it , he loves it , i wish they would more comic based stuff it goes over great here .	1

my daughter received this wagon her 1st birthday it only took 20 minutes assemble . it very durable plenty room your child anything else you need take ride . love high sides which help supporting child i don't need worry her falling out ! you need storage space this one though it large end quite heavy so best if stored garage where it just wheeled	1
i love room this wagon ... but way handle made dangerous . it hit my 3 year old head couple times . it designed fold inwards instead out isn't greatest idea . it also might just defective one i received but i found it too tippy . which also dangerous . i really researched these wagons i thought i going getting best one according all reviews i read but i am not satisfied it all . i am now working researching some more new one i decided i would probably just better off going store personally check them out myself .	-1

year half , our daughter went through phase where she wanted mommy keys all time . enter this key ring , so she could her own keys . good points : - they metal-looking keys klink , instead plastic obviously-fake keys . - they're easy handle- sounds lights fun during car trips . only downside : sounds very realistic . grandma gone get door few times when door button pushed . dad freaked out when driving car , she pushed honking horns/traffic noise . tip : she didn't want play them until i pretended use them car house . once she thought they " real " she interested	1

i wasn't sure what think this when my 9 year old daughter picked this out birthday present . after setting it up , reading simple directions , playing few games it , i'm pleasantly surprised i'm hooked it ! object move your " mirrors " one time cause your laser cannon reflect your mirrors onto your opponents " tower . " first one hit opponents tower their laser winner -- evidenced flashing lights explosion sound . kids really get big kick out this . although rules say you only make one move or adjustment your mirrors time only test fire your laser once after each move , my kids flexible rule . they make several adjustments per move which makes game faster keeps them getting frustrated . my 9 10 year old play this each other but it little too difficult my 5 7 year olds . careful lasers though , they real low-level lasers should never pointed anyone eyes . so if your kids aren't responsible enough handle , i'd stay away . otherwise , give it try i think you'll like it too	-1

this item very cheaply made . some parts not stay together , etc . i am happy price i paid it through amazon --- thankfully i didn't pay what it selling stores ! but notice right after christmas it clearance approximately 70% off . alone lets you know it not best quality . my daughter tried enjoy this toy , but pieces falling off she just got fed up . it least played her toys . she owns numerous little mommy products really enjoys dolls . retail prices toddler doll activity center certainly led me believe they would better quality	-1

i no idea how tiny these dolls going . there should something advertising let collector mcfarlane nba dolls know these not normal size ; , fact , miniatures . they hardly look like anybody , let alone allen iverson chris webber . huge disappointment me my son	-1
i've read several reviews this item quite honestly , i don't understand why so many people posted negative reviews . this wonderful toy allows children creative . my 5-year-old son thoroughly enjoyed this product . i gave him wet rag use clean it which work better than sponge comes toy . i am not big stencils since they restrict creativity but he used them trace designs onto doodle pro board which encourage fine motor development . overall , great toy take car or resturant or simply use make brilliant drawings home .	1
my daughter 4 years old loves trace so i decided her doodle pro glow . outside it looked like snap wipe clean , what mistake ! first you make sure your child not smear marker ( which stains ) all over place , second they provide you tiny sponge ( not same picture box)and you wash it clean after every stroke across board . i don't know you but i get tired running back fourth trying keep it clean . third you then wipe board clean dry cloth since wet sponge never gets all it off . take my advice pass up this toy go simple doodle pro , much easier all around .	1
radio flyer seriously messed up when they designed this trike . part concept great ... it folds up ! second part concept telescoping handle not steer , kinda jiggly start , isn't wide enough you really steer your kid . problem lies design . you can't ability co-pilot like other radio flyer trikes because it folds up . disconnects handle rear front wheel , which what steers . it jiggles around because it telescopes out , meaning all those little spaces where one segment fits into next equals lot room time you pull it out all way . you can't easily steer ( you pick up back or lift front turn if you steering locked ) , you push back forth keep it going straight . this hard small handle they put this thing . save your money get one their other ones , which all great reviews	-1
i bought this trike my one year old grandson although he out town my daughter says he loves it even enjoys pushing other people around it . so it seems great present probably first many bikes he his life	-1
this your best way purchase these ! these all we use we love them !	1
i bought this bike my daughter 3rd birthday . she absolutely loves it . she rides it all time it one only bike she reach get peddles around all way . this bike wonderful littler child who can't seem quite reach peddles other similar size bikes . way it built enables child reach without uncomfortable sitting way forward . it great !!	1
i got this my son 9th birthday . it looked like so much fun , but it just bunch colored ping pong balls top hair dryer . lots tiny pieces . they invented lot ridiculously complicated games disguise essential boringness . i almost returned it but couldn't face repacking . no one plays it , i'll probably pitch it into trash few weeks	-1
bought this christmas although it assemble easily looked great my daughter able turn handle bars get them out alignment . i tried several times tighten handle bars but no matter what i it always easy turn handle bars they slip out place . also front wheel out alignment not perpendicular ground ( review mentioned same thing so apparently it not just one i bought ) . very disappointing i returning it	-1
i requested this cart my 2 yr . old last christmas - it cute " goes " her dolly , but i really wish i'd asked more sturdy cart . she likes basket separates , but handle so flush basket , she only put smaller things it . i thought it'd fun basket seat detach , but they difficult child put back she ask me it . plus , both her dollies ' legs get caught seat so she can't get them out either . most food things cardboard , which i yes , laminated packaging tape , they still not hold up . banana , milk dish cute , but i don't think they warrent choosing this cart	-1
my husband i just bought this toy my daughter today . she loved her cousin ' similar ' toy ( different brand ) , but we thought this product cuter , although more expensive . well after 20 minutes play , we decided it needed go back several reasons : 1 . wheels very cheaply made not turn ( her cousin cart turned like real cart ) . 2 . basket way too small . 3 . basket comes off too easily . 4 . cardboard boxes obviously silly wouldn't last minute if we given them her , but cuteness other food items outweighed this negative point us . due numbers 1 3 above , my daughter became easily frustrated cart not turning . but good sport , she moved around other side trying turn it way , but then course basket ( which almost falls off anyway ) , gives way she fell flat her face . shame us choosing " cute " over sturdy ! beware - this product may unsafe . we're taking it back today exchanging it same one her cousin 1/3 price - we already know it turn , basket large , it won't fall apart !	-1

we attached imaginative minds keyboard extra computer we put it children playroom . they love it ! teaches them colors , what color combinations make ( red yellow make orange ! ) , shapes they love music . initial software bit limited older children ( we 1 , 2 4 year old use this)but just fine younger one . buttons nice large little hands manipulate but i think children little disappointed phone didn't work i fear it lost quickly since it not attached . all all little pricey but very solid entertaining product . definitely plus you switch other language well !	1
my daughter plays this every day . awesome toy . this only toy i know you play so many languages . very educational	1
we purchased this toy becuase my husband one when he toddler - 51 years ago ! while we still toy it gone through many children hands not very playable our own kids now . i thought remake would alike but it isn't .

first off , i address issue choo-choo sound constantly going off . same thing happened our puzzle , constantly ! i realized sound light-activated ... when all pieces put together , " sensor " goes off because darkness . if there any pieces missing lights go off , same thing happens , because sound triggered light/darkness . great product - fun brightly colored . however , little pegs serve handles each individual piece may come loose disattach , posing choking hazard child . use parental supervision	-1
this must if you geotrax starter set . my son received basic tracktown railway 2 1/2 we immediately went out bought him elevation track packs . adults set layout up , its little bit trickier 3 dimensions , but elevation what makes geotrax way better than any other train set ! only drawback you can't just buy one elevation track pack . this one would most logical buy if you only buy one set though . it ramps get up level 2 , but this much more fun if you get up level 3 . i would recommend adding ramps this set . we 1 each 3 elevation packs that enough connect all elevation accessories we ( clock tower , suspension bridge , mile high mountain ) . definitely add your geotrax , its worth it ! your child love it so yo	1

this toy godsend ! william received this activity center his 1st birthday , he adored it ! when he little , i'd place bear ville activity center center living room floor , he'd play 45-minutes or more . this toy never got old him because i rotated his toys . moreover , this plaything keeps kids interested , because there so many activities explore . progressive learning great too . children understand almost instantly how get garage spinning , it probably highlight unit . shape sorter entertaining too . unlike other shape sorters , this unit requires shapes sorted properly , which i like . it led bit frustration early , but he caught , enjoyed aspect enormously . stairway one activity took while catch . he didn't understand how operate catapult movement until he probably 2-years old , but then he'd snap bear place continually fling him off platform . this produced many fits laughter ! william now 4� outgrown toy ; however , he still asks play it when he full service garage out . i'm not sure why , but his mind , they go together . only safety concern we've encountered bear ville activity center shape sorter . soon after william received toy , he tried retrieve circular shapes forcing his hand entrance point , rather than flipping door open . his hand stuck , he cried , but it didn't discourage his play session . he continued play if nothing happened . i think if there any room improvement , i'd suggest company they eliminate circular shape exchange maybe diamond , or heart-shape so children can't wedge their little hands circular opening . if you've read any my other chicco toy reviews , you know i think they're fabulous playthings ! they heavy-duty , developmental , toys children seem love . bear ville activity center dropped , even stepped upon umpteen times , shows little signs wear . it easy clean too . just apply soapy water cloth , minutes , it ready play . definitely winner our household .	1
bath toys great idea any child ... if they don't make too much mess . :) it helps strengthen child muscles while making sometimes unpleasant part child routine little more enjoyable	1
i highly recommend symphonic stacker any baby . my 6 month old loves it playing it few months already . pieces soft chewable ribbons mesmerizing my little one . sounds fun not all obnoxious . great product	1
my two-year-old son loves all his wooden thomas trains ! they keep him busy hours extremely durable . someone gave us some metal/plastic thomas trains , he plays them too , but their plastic parts break quickly ( ie : harold plastic helicopter blades , plastic " link-ups " , etc . ) wooden ones magnets seem last forever , only minor paint wear resulting lots lots playtime ! used conjunction videos or books , they teach things like proper behavior all those good " moral " examples . plus , they teach colors numbers because design each individual train . he loves james ' bright red color . fact they not battery-powered not absolutely require track huge " plus " me . they go anywhere , anything house serve railway track . it only limited your child imagination ( climbing ability . ) we visit friend house recently who battery-powered thomas , my son enjoy it also , so we may possibly getting few those add collection holidays . reviewer felt they " dinky " disappointed size trains . me , one best features . i said , they go anywhere ( keeps him busy restaurant ! ) they perfectly proportioned fit very well into small hands . plus , they don't take up so much space your house , especially if you start whole collection ! however , warned they underfoot all times because your kids love play them so much , so watch your step . sometimes simplest thing best thing , i think that definitely case thomas trains	1
i bought my son james reward because james one his favorites ( it might james my son middle name , but who knows ) . james , other big engines coal cars , they my son favorites . fact , he take all coal cars , put them together one train pull them . he figured out only one train pulls cargo , not pulls other trains . anyone who complains price isn't thomas fan . thomas pricey , plain simple , but you also getting lifetime guarentee . if anything breaks , they send you new one	1
my daughter got this when she 9 or 10 . she now almost 12 still uses it . it true nail polish not same quality adult polish , but because it thick opaque it makes it easier designs . even if polish runs out , book designs instructions still used . my daughter always using it decorate her own her friends ' nails . it probably helps if your child fairly good fine motor skills .	-1

i hesitant when my husband suggested getting this our 13-month-old daughter christmas . but i figured since we money it'd something she could grow into , then why not . she took it right away . she immediately figured how get out . she figured out horn engine buttons . it took her week or so realize red button makes it go . she doesn't understand steering , but she never lets off button . i turned steering wheel all way right let her go circles back yard . it goes over grass no problem only bogs down little areas yard where grass little thicker . i've no problem steering like others noted - but course she not steering much . my husband say never pick it up steering wheel - so maybe something played role problem . straps could designed little better - maybe like stroller . overall , this great toy designed smaller kids not ready bigger 12 volt jeep type toys	1

other reviewers mentioned , game easy set-up put away . i took off one star mainly because penguins occasionally fall into crack wobbling iceberg stable platform difficult remove . addition , my son gets frustrated game very quickly , since falling penguin potentially take other penguins down him . i'm trying teach him relax , but six-year-olds cannot always persuaded life go whether penguins remain upright or not . we've learned play few quick rounds then try different activity entirely	-1

i love game pente . it one those games deceptivly simple . i learned love this game one old style paper boards . you would weigh down corners prevent curling . not so this version . instead paper , it mat so it stays flat . bottom grips table , so there no slipping . i even believe mat resistant spills . yet , it still simple roll back up so it easily fits back into tube . i highly recommend it !	1
i ordered this item excited relive some childhood memories game very disappointed . what i hoping would reproduction original instead ugly , overpriced mousepad ! print quality board joke . very blurry ugly blue instead nice cream color original .. instead thin piece leather-like material like original , board same thickness mousepad thick rubber backing everything . ok , no big deal , right ? wrong ! imagine how disappointed i when i rolled up board discover board stones not fit into tube ! no wonder they ship it outside tube box ! glass stones much like original , but very light color -- this only good thing going set so i'll give it 1 star . i sent this item back immediately upon receipt would encourage anyone else interested pente find original set not buy this joke reproduction	-1

i purchased pink one major toy store $319 . what $600 price here ? i thought $319 lot . anyway , everyone loves this vehicle it worth price because children just never get bored it . it powerful drive grass up down gradual sidewalks . i bought it my 7-year old she her friends all love it she still fit into car until age 9 , i guess ( she normal-sized child ) . radio cannot heard when driving though . " seat belts " velcro them " decoration only " so they don't really secure child into car . passenger , my 2-year old actually fell out door onto sidewalk when car driven up gradual curb . so i went fabric store purchased plastic buckles ( like ones strollers ) also purchased nylon belt ( like strollers ) which sold yard . belt easily threads through seat works well . i didn't sew -- just tied knots buckles stay . really , putting these " seat belts " so easy monkey could it it necessary children who younger than kindergarten . i walking right next car but my toddler fell out so fast even my quick reflexes i could not catch him ( mom nightmare ) . manufacturer probably not include real seat belts liability purposes . again , this car may expensive , but well worth it we probably sell it after my child outgrows it . btw , my son shares this computer so there some reviews him under this name	1
let me start off saying we love this toy . however , we our 2nd one . we bought our 4 year old black one christmas . we problems our radio day one . march i stopped toysrus talk manager tell him problem . he easily swapped it out gave us new pink/purple one . which awesome . however , again we started problems radio . it started shutting itself off when you hit bump , then decided stay not go off until batteries ran out . i called buyers protection plan people asked this problem . i informed they getting almost daily calls radios not working . they suggested store manager get touch manufacturer see if there fix . obviously we still fun without radio , but it very nice feature . we would still buy again because my daughter best time it	-1

there simply no way anyone could like this safe . 1 ) drawer cannot take * any * weight . forget even putting few coins it it because once you , it won't open ! 2 ) it eats batteries like 500lb man eats hamburgers . literally full pack aa batteries every few weeks ! reason , this thing flashes lights even when nobody near it or it not use . 3 ) cheap construction , this thing engineered fail . half time drawer fails open , keypad fails work , it flakes out other half time . avoid this junk all costs	-1
i gave this 5 star rating toy not safe !! my 9yr old daughter received this safe christmas gift it her favorite out all toys she got . best part combination easily reset so when it forgotten you still get your stuff . alarm security code she loves hiding away her gameboy her younger sister . this not secure functional safe -- it toy drawer easily resetable combination code . great younger kids . my 4yr old wants one her birthday now so she hide away her treasures her siblings	1

sigh . brings back memories . this exactly same i remember my childhood . metal sounds , strength , cool light reflections , durability much better than you find newer plastic models , price right . my only complaint it comes shipped absurd amount packaging several times size actual toy , which wasteful annoying wade through . but once it open , it bring hours entertainment -- yes , it still walks down stairs	-1

my daughter recv'd this ant farm her 5th b-day . we ordered ants , unfortunately they came when we away vacation . basically all dead . i called company they resent more ants free charge . we got our new ants within 2 weeks . i absolutely just love watching them ( maybe more than my kids ) . i also 3 year old . it so interesting such learning experience . they so maitenance free . i definately recommend this ant farm .. it interesting fun . ants very social creatures . i also purchased whole kit . it many interesting things learn it .	1
all i say she rocks all dolls ! they all so beautiful ! someone said roxxi weird shaped head she ugly . what mean ?! all heads same ! i think they all so attractive ! buy them all ! rock angelz forever ! -courtney , rock fan singe	1
first when i saw rock angelz bratz i thought it strange jade cloe white hair . then i saw rock angelz movie began like dolls . i found them sale bought cloe doll rock angelz sasha my friend birthday . when i got cloe out package i realized her hair actually very pale blond instead white , brown streaks . her eyes brownish color . her rock angelz outfit consists white top , black jacket , denim pants , red hat , red boots . i didn't really like boots over pants first but now i've gotten used it . after concert she change into black top red mini skirt . my opinion both outfits look better without hat . cloe also comes some things . main accessories include shiny red doll stand , microphone microphone stand , guitar , mini cd containing rock angelz theme cloe song , " you think . " i liked second song best . smaller accessories include orange sunglasses , jewelry , lipstick , cell phone , red star shaped hairbrush . parents should know doll supposed pierced bellybutton . there small jewel her stomach . i mentioned this because some people may not want their kids see doll . i rate her 5 stars durability , but i don't play mine , so i'm not sure how it would hold up if child constantly played doll carried it around , but bratz dolls i since i younger held up well , except slightly faded clothing chips lipstick . i only give it 1 star educational , because it doesn't really teach anything . i give her 5 stars fun , but i'm not really sure , either . i am almost teenager i collect bratz dolls instead playing them , but my older bratz dolls fun when i child . i recommend this doll , especially older children or collectors . younger children can't really keep track small accessories included .	1

i just got this my kids love it . we bought this because it small didn't take up ton room like full play stove . my kids wanting play kitchen , but four kids tiny apartment , there just wasn't room one . i like it self contained small storage purposes . so when they want play they only dig it out set it up but it easily stored shelf when it not use . i also like it wood vs plastic . i'm trying get away plastic toys whenever possible . i bought super baking set super cooking set their utensils . i like qaulity those well . all items both sets fit into stove storage minus little measuring cup . it would fit but it just bit too high . i fully plan buying more alex cooking fun	1
game alot fun , but don't play it timer . timer doesn't give you enough time think which cards use , make shape . #1 cards easiest ones make	1
my 2 year old granddaughter loves bear . she little young it so we watch her carefully it . she so excited when he starts talking telling stories . only problem we when you open package , it not clear there no cartridge comes bear book . first story already programmed into bear . i didn't realize until we went hasbro website .	-1
i 5 year old son he loves books read . i can't devote all my time reading him ... don't get me wrong i still every day but tj my big helper . while i am cooking dinner or cleaning house my son listen stories i my hands free but best all we still getting storytime together he loves it . speech comment made one review i look it tj supposed 5 years old . i personally think it adds little something special toy	1
love this bear . soft , durable , so cute moving head , ears , arms . cute story , like you purchase more stories . thought it great price such nice product . i got it my 10 month old granddaughter christmas . smiles expressions my granddaughters face she listened him first time pricless made my daughter cry she watched her . says it all	1
my opinion this way games supposed : rules easy understand , easily learned 5 minutes . typical game takes 15 minutes . mastering game takes much longer --- i can't tell you how long , because i haven't mastered it yet . i've played this game quite few times now , am amazed complexity involved game play . every move you make , you judge tradeoff knowledge you gain knowledge you give your opponent(s ) . you even try fool your opponent(s ) , making move would seem obviously wrong your point view ( but confusion may pay off later ) . i would say it much more interesting game than mastermind , or most games , because it depends less chance more skill . it great lesson logic reasoning game theory . i would say coda almost interesting complex games like go , bridge or chess , but much easier learn quicker play . i concur one other reviews i read : coda classic making . highly recommended	1
awesome present- my 4 year old nephew loved it . he got it christmas this past year it still holding up strong . great , realistic , paint job holding up well many ' crashes ' . they great buy also . i highly recomend them .	1
if your children play hard toys ...... this definitely isn't toy them .. it broke very 1st day ! threw garbage	-1

my son i great expectations this game ; our expectations quickly turned disappointment . this " game " really hard call game . it more like one long reading exercise . unlike many other l-max games , wherein you learn modules through interactive play , this one you read read read same story over again . once you complete story , you then go area " unlock " game . then order play " game " you read some more . this not type game where you standby provide guidance when needed , i found myself reading page , after page , after page , just figure out myself objective " game " then try explain it my son . i felt money i paid this game waste , no wonder when i went purchase it , it only one stock . buyers beware	-1

we got tote markers also set cw finger paints when we flew ca mi few months ago . my boy just turned 2 so he little young package guidelines but not too young drawing thing , i am sure most would agree . so i love idea these markers . thing , there delay when you color when color shows up . imagine coloring apple ... color , color , color ... but nothing showing ... until few seconds , color starts show ... it annoying ! i think my boy somewhat frustrated delay . coloring books only treated cw chemicals inside lines pics , which kind weird ... you can't elaborate picture , or even sign your name ( unless you use kind marker)all all markers better than paints ... plain paper better than coloring books ... but i can't say i am terribly impressed this product . i think it good travel item , though ... so your kid can't mark up property belonging anyone else ... it just doesn't seem replace fun coloring regular markers or crayons 100% . there something lacking . ( it * * however improvement books i remember when i younger ... just white marker ... picture lots black gray changed colors when you used marker ...	1

i thought this paddle edition jakks retro atari games improvement over their joystick edition . it easier control game options thanks lot interactivity on-screen lets you know difficulty settings such . this one includes arcade versions pong warlords boot ! i found control pretty easy use , though not great i remember atari paddles working ( but i so much younger then , possibly better eye-hand coordination ) . this great collection atari games including night driver , street racer , video olympics ( pong ) , warlords ( atari arcade versions ! ) , steeple chase , circus atari ( also found joystick one ) , demons diamonds , breakout , super breakout , casino , canyon bomber . nice mix driving , tennis , arcade shooters , breakout style games ( pretty much what you want paddle ! ) . there two-player edition available makes pong better game . but computer not unbeatable , there several settings all games make them what they always - simple play classics . i've enjoyed every edition tv games so far ( atari , activision namco -- no , i don't spongebob or blue clues ) . nice thing they portable load quickly . i like not unpack fire up my video game console every time i want quick diversion . overall this great addition my growing collection retro games .	-1
this so far our favorite gamewright game our family . it took little while our 5 year old learn game , but he now play his own known win , really annoys our 13 year old . this some strategy involved this game . you easily play two people or 6 people . we 5 our family . it nice game we all play one time it isn't time consuming monopoly . each player dealt 4 cards face down . you line up cards front you face down . you allowed look two cards end , but not cards middle . you take turns drawing card pile middle(which face down ) or picking card top discard pile(which face up . you try exchange your higher numbered cards lower numbers . you try get all four cards low possible ( 0 9 ) then you shout out rat ' tat cat . everyone gets one more chance then you add up points . score keeper records adds up points each player . object game get lowest number points adding up all 4 cards end round . we ussually play 50 or 100 points , people get 50 points they would out game . each time there round dealer shuffles entire deck passes out 4 more cards per player . each person gets turn deal . there peek cards , allowing you peek card you may not now . there draw 2 cards , giving you two chances get low number card , if you don't want card you draw you just place it face up discard pile . there swap cards , allowing you swap card player , so paying attention important . all 4 cards always kept face down . you only look two end cards before play begins , you look card you draw just one time . after no peeking allowed , so you try remember what infront you sometimes you take chance two middle cards , since you don't now what those cards unless you get peek card or you just risk it discard card . it isn't complicated it sounds , but it take while our 5 year old beable play without partner . our kids beg play this game us . cards could made better , they aren't very well laminated .	1

wake explosion number baseball card sets produced each year i , like anne father jane austen father , retrenched . only set i pick up each year " basic " set put out topps . i not this because topps provides more " first year " players prospects eternal quest official " rookie " card some future hall famer , but because i currently complete run topps baseball card sets going back 1968 ( i also complete sets 1956 , 1961 , 1964-66 , four hall famers go finish 1953 couple dozen high numbers complete 1967 set ) . all these sets arranged binders beginning leader cards , then highlights , post season world series cards . then all teams arranged they finished , beginning world champion red sox , all those aforementioned first year prospect cards back . so i am here history not gum ( not there gum anymore , but you get point ) . 733 cards 2005 topps set broken down into 534 veterans , 30 managers ( 267-296 ) , 35 first year subjects ( 297-326 ) future stars ( 327-331 ) , 17 season highlights ( 332-336 ) including postseason ( 349-55 ) world series ( 731-34 ) 12 league leaders ( 337-348 ) , 24 sporting news all-stars ( 356-367 , 719-730 ) , 30 team photos ( 638-67 ) , 25 draft picks ( 668-87 ) prospects ( 688-92 ) , 2 combos ( 693-94 ) 24 award winners including rawlings gold gloves ( 695-712 ) , cy young ( 713-14 ) , mvp ( 715-716 ) , rookie year ( 717-18 ) . then you also get 5 cello-wrapped prospect cards featuring players who not part topps series 1 or 2 . aware you get set those five cards prospects few select teams , namely new york yankees , boston red sox , chicago cubs , san francisco giants , detroit tigers , washington nationals . i supposed such cards might considered key inducement buying complete set , but fact you get complete set without open dozens packs series 1 then waiting same series 2 should enough ( unless , course , you like opening pack see if you might find rocket , a-rod , or ichiro ) . two things remember 2005 topps set . first , reason there 733 cards but last card numbered 734 because topps retired card #7 honor mickey mantle after he passed away . it made sense since mantle 1952 topps rookie card ( which also high number ) icon baseball card collecting . honus wagner t206 holy grail just getting see one would thrill but forget every owning one ( whereas you sell you card get 52 mantle ) . second , release series 1 series 2 , barry bonds made deal topps . why he not appear front ( nor he mentioned back ) 2004 national league batting average leaders card ( 343 ) , even though he led nl batting ( his name appear back nl home run leaders card ( 345 )) . but you find this year he both regular card ( 500 ) 2004 national league mvp award card ( 716 ) . he should shot giants team ( 662 ) , but i would not swear it . bonds must gotten swear deal since his logo appears below mlbpa logo bottom box .	-1

my daughter loves elmo , she excited see her new elmo toy her 2nd borthday , she loves when it plays music she dances around , but when you turn pages it play follow light game instead just playing music , she found bit frustrating	-1
personally , i don't like this toy all ready return it after we it home two hours -- my toddler , however , different ideas!!elmo head moves very stiffly slightly different color his body . sound very " tinkly " just doesn't sound like high quality toy . fact , one point i thought elmo speaking different language -- it wasn't until my husband listened toy we able figure out elmo saying " follow lights . " however , my 21 month old loves this toy played it multiple times day since we brought it home . she even wanted take it bed her first night wouldn't go upstairs until she put her elmo piano " night-night " family room ! she no problems pressing keys turning pages piano book . she also quickly found on/off switch sometimes startles herself turning volume onto loud setting . one games ( lack better word ) this toy " follow lights " game where child plays song they press lit up piano keys -- this way too advanced young child she no interest this feature . even though i'm not fan toy , based my daughter love it , i gave this piano 4 star rating	-1
you see jackie robinson hit ball ? he hit it boy , ain't all . he stole home . yes , yes , jackie real gone . front packaging this cooperstown series 3 figure jackie robinson brooklyn dodgers , it informs us he " first rookie year mlb history . " course , not exactly why robinson hall fame or why one smartest things they ever major league baseball retired robinson #42 all teams ( there only one active player still wearing number because grandfather clause , mariano rivera , who also heading cooperstown ) . suffice it say this bit understatement regarding importance jackie robinson baseball history . first thing said this mcfarlane toys action figure they picked perfect pose remembering jackie robinson , showing him stealing home , just like it talks woodrow buddy johnson song , " you see jackie robinson hit ball ? " quoted above . it also how jackie shown 33 cent stamp issued commemorate 1940s 20 cent commemorative stamp honor robinson post office put out 1982 . not only robinson break color barrier when he joined brooklyn dodgers 1947 but he brought speed game negro leagues major leagues , stealing home 19 times . this time it makes sense not only jackie uniform but also home plate covered dirt slide . figure held base single pin you want sure adjust it so left shin nestles up against little raised pile dirt front home plate . this means jackie left foot touching home plate so he clearly safe . this smaller pin already base where you stick jackie hat , which fallen his head . there limited articulation this figure : head two arms both adjusted slightly . however , pose you see above basically what you going end up when you display this one . finally , additional bonus points sculpting job they jackie face , which one best mcfarlane toys turned out date . it lists robinson playing 2b , which main position 1948-52 ( he played 1b his rookie season mostly 35 his last years baseball ) . far i am concerned all baseball fans should figures babe ruth jackie robinson , because they two most important players baseball history it not matter who you root ( babe series 2 , although there sepia toned version figure out there well ) . other five action figures series 3 cooperstown collection mickey mantle new york yankees ( 3-time american league mvp ) , roberto clemente pittsburgh pirates ( 11-time all-star ) , carlton fisk boston red sox urging his famous home run game 6 1975 world series stay fair fenway park ( 11-time all-star ) , nolan ryan california angel ( all-time strikeout king ) , don mattingly new york yankees ( yankee captain 1985 american league mvp ) . it great figures great players past there certainly some more members dodgers both brooklyn ( e.g , roy campanella , duke snider ) los angeles ( e.g. , sandy koufax , don drysdale ) who i hope see future cooperstown series .	-1

hasbro making some quality star wars toys this no exception . few weeks ago , i looking this my son could not find it . i find non-star wars version maker . other gun all sorts sounds , some which sound more like elevator doors than laser blaster . it irritating . we finally found this blaster bought it . ( silly string version all over place , but who wants clean up silly string constantly replace canisters ) . laser blaster solid . plastic used construction strong solidly put together . you never get feeling it would easy break ( though i didn't test its limits ) . when you tap sides your finger nails , it almost sounds like solid piece plastic , rather than molded sections . also , sounds realistic . while there only two sounds , they what you expect laser blaster sound like . lighting barrel looks good . however , it seems ' light ' too long . i guess that just realism thing let face it , laser blasters not yet real . even so , i still think flash should shorter . overall , i think it best laser gun toy i seen . it looks cool , its sounds make it play cool , it tough nails . don't fear expense . i think it worth every bit $20	1
no young star wars fan effectively re-live scenes star wars movies without blaster ! my son already 5 lightsabers , but could never pretend general grievous , han solo , or storm trooper . then course , when i played padme or leia , i needed gun . now he blaster , he happiest little jedi ever . so far , it seems pretty sturdy . it lights up sounds realistic too . cool toy	-1

i give this doll 2 stars because least she very well presented box she brought delight my 7 year old day . after 1st day , suzie no longer worked . we tried replacing batteries but no avail . we should heeded advice some other reviewers . if you want suzie her looks , great . but if you actually want doll works , consider different purchase	-1

my nephew enjoyed this toy , however i found balls touch bit too difficult hammer down , thus making it much louder than need . i think age group should set higher because strength needed , overall well built toy . his older brother no problems playing it	-1
our daughter received this toy gift , her arm got stuck one holes top while reaching ball it went down . she nearly broke her arm trying get it out ( luckily we supervising stepped ) . also , balls hard pound through holes since base not attached main piece , two separate constantly . this toy huge disappointment	-1
we based our purchase this toy feedback previous listed . toy appears durable my son enjoy it , but there some things forcing us reconsider our purchase . balls really need pounded them go down holes - my son can't it yet it takes my wife i above average hit . balls also got stuck en route down occasion - we haven't it month . unless you believe your child really wants this , your $20 may better spent elsewhere	-1
my twins got this toy their first birthday , they now 17 months . they like train all animals ; it just not favorite toy . they like train , but we turn moving function ( thumbs up able turn off wheels ) because my daughters kept stopping it moving away them . songs annoying , but upbeat . we all like animal sounds you get when you push bell or place animal engine . i just wish some animal sounds more identifiable which animal says what ( what animal says " chomp , chomp " ? ) . all animals except monkey comes train give satisfying clicking noises when you move arms/legs around . bottom feet/hands all different colors sometimes beads added interest . twins like play animals move their arm/legs into all sorts unnatural poses . my favorite flying giraffe . we since bought/received most rest this series toys they seem all similar . polar bear monkey set nice because they electronic animal sounds when you move head carrying cases	-1
adorable , bright , strong , big train set ! larger than i imagined . i purchaed this my new grandchild . i , myself , 3 sons who train set similar this but smaller . all 3 them loved it played it years . i'm hoping my grandchild gets much joy entertainment . this particular site offered it $5 less than fisher price site , ( i am comparison shopper ) . it arrived within 2 days !	1
my daughter , who just turned 1 , received amazing animals sing go choo-choo . my 2 1/2 year old son my daughter both enjoy this toy . it catchy song animal sounds great . we also bought zebra lion their cars . only problem wheels don't seem work well our carpet or ceramic tile . wheels tend spin not make train go anywhere most time , but both my kids still enjoy it	-1
i got this puzzle my 1 1/2 yr old . sound not work so i'm basically considering this toy defective . i likely won't return it b/c i don't want deal hassle	-1
my son few dvds go this system but he absolutely loves this one . so i !. it wonderful story great lesson kids learn . great animation voice character fits character so well . my son memorizing story loves read . he also loves dvd little blue train , but this still his favorite . this dvd meant played read me dvd system previous reviewer gave this dvd negative rating but it appears they don't even own this system able play it back .	1
this fun game , but play more challenging levels you build some machines ( like scale , race car , ramp)that used over over game . unfortunately , materials provided not very sturdy . dowels too big fit into some required pieces consequently , my husband broke one dowels trying force it into discs necessary build scale . then we couldn't use scale , which really disappointing because it central game . also , my ten year old found error one question cards - answer provided incorrect . said all , we still enjoy game play it alot even though we can't use scale . it very interesting , especially if your child inclination towards logic , mechanics , or physical sciences . my son loves it , because he mechanical minded ( i'm not ! ) , he gets kick out getting answers right mom gets wrong	-1
my son loves his tractor . he rides it several times day . it definitely his favorite toy	1
this puzzle disappointment . pieces poorly made don't stay connected . i thought picture would same tin circus animals . upside , tin very nice my son loves use it carry his trains around . giant thomas floor puzzle ( 24 pieces ) much better	-1
my son loves this bench . only thing it smaller than expected , but still worth it	-1
moon my room really neat light . my son 7 years old just thinks its great . every night he puts cd it comes his player turns his moon . i also bought glow dark planets stars so now he feels like he out this world	1
my son loves moon his room . we turn it part his good night routine . it shuts off automatically no cords . really cool decoration kid room , i would loved it my room , too	1
i see one reviewer gigaball came instructions . how nice - mind didn't . it took four hours fill up pretty good air compressor because air leaked out faster than it would fill up . i kept patching holes new ones kept appearing . it like twilight zone . worst part it how disappointed my children . i not purchasing product this company . quality obviously alien concept them	-1
my kids loved this toy ! they sit it , roll around it , climb it ... it great ! i even find them occasionally sitting inside giga ball book . only drawback it seems attract lot insects ( bright yellow color perhaps ??? )	-1
this toy provided hours enjoyment my son who 18 months old . i love fact it only two pieces it even place store bat ! he loves sound effects he even older friends who play it trying hit home run	1
i copy original game before it changed after four years its present format . it simple , got job , fast-paced , cost less	-1
this version added quite few dimensions game we our house playing non-stop over year now . while original monopoly staple , we all know its subtilties ( sp ? ) , this game all flavors original added lot game . i dare say we might playing lot more it upcoming months . highly recommended , however we adjusted rules bit ; game seems unfairly make boardwalk property ( usually not great property ) single most important property . look discussion section this listing rule changes we come up fix this problem . i'd like other opinions . - jl	1
floating blocks great tub toy . there nice mesh storage bag you hang them they virtually wet proof . my son kevin who 15 months old , enjoys stacking blocks tub sometimes eating them too ( but they safe ) . i would recommend these blocks babies who stage where they able stack blocks	1
great 2 pack two nflers . brooks looks like he chasing gannon down . while gannon running his life just like super bowl 37 . which brooks bucs won	1
i bought mega bloks dragon mountain set myself few months ago yet put it together . only things i put together dragons . instructions putting it together well . they tell you exactly what you need each step . improvement would some views above make building process little easier . completed structure actually two separate structures joined bridge mine car . impressive this set , it holds together quite well . key build , any other mega bloks set , good hard level surface . i've moved it couple times one smaller base sections fall off , but that no big deal since there nothing underneath hold it place . it'll take two trips move it so don't move it all once . just make sure you carry larger structure holding onto floor second level take your time while moving it . one other nice improvement would addition second cannon . i love idea mounting cannon onto dragon , but it would nice either second cannon mounted smaller structure it shows instructions or even better yet , harpoon lancher . other than , i feel dragon mountain great addition mega bloks dragons series	1
i very pleased bead kit . children loved it	1
this deck not like original yugi deck . its much better . you get cards like black luster soldier , swords revealing light , much more . ( i also put my egyptain god card winged dragon ra this deck , sold game dawn destiny )	1

this production description wrong . you confusing two versions these cars options-items into one description . you cant two different transmitter ranges ! hobby grade 50 yard range not 100 , digital proportional steering different full function . check your stockproduct descriptionabout 35 " , it 1/6 scale !..... scale speed over 120mph !... .. live speed over 20mph !..... this not toy ! it ages 16 up ...... new box !...... complete ready race ...... complete batteries , battery pack charger ....... 100+ yard range ..... impact wrench transmitter .... 12v ni-cd battery pack charger ..... 6 aa batteries ..... body shell removable ..... full function features ..... forward , reverse , left right turn ..... adjustable front wheel alignment ..... on/off switch bottom car ..... officially licensed ...... authentic team graphics ....... four wheel independent spring suspension .... high performance motor ..... impact absorbing rear front bumper ... impact wrench type transmitter ..... race up 5 cars .... 50 yard signal range .... hobby grade features ..... digital proportional steering .... multiple frequencies ..... variable speed ..... 120 scale mph ( scale 20+mph ) ....	1
mattel made such great idea making this doll . i just bought her love her . most pollys` i dont like because they dont real hair , but this one ! i love little turtle . also , you should buy polly pia pack because they go really well this doll . most time i take her out me ... everywhere ! also , clothes more durable , they dont fall off , theyre prettier too . she also educational because she encourage us help animals . buy this doll	1
i don't remember age range this game , but i would recommend 10 up . i played this my daughter her friend . some wishes explained , because girls never heard some things . like , " hosting charity ball . " but over all this good game , you learn lot your friends short amount time . i think she able play it years come . really good sleep over game	-1
my nephew little over 1 year he absolutly loved this toy . it seems like it would pretty stupid , but some reason balls popping out one end rolling other really captivated them .	-1
it numerous sound feature . music tune it fairly entertaining . however , touch sensor aren't sensitive . you press it numerous times make it work . it didn't entertain my child all .	-1
my 8 year old bored 5 minutes . don't waste your money . screens hard see . volume control but reset every time it restarted . overall this game very dissapointing	-1
my daughter received this doll christmas erica two years ago both dolls still going strong . they both voice tracks which still working , they both great shape , even though their hair gowns taken beating . unfortunately after two years changing exchanging gowns , bodices now ripping apart ( they already sewn once ) . loss gowns reason rating 4 stars instead five . aside , it one nicest , if not nicest their video tie-in products .	-1

don't waste your money this pooh . my son got him christmas didn't really care anything him . i know you change songs but our pooh says happy birthday my son every day . i probably change , though . he doesn't keep time . every day he got more more off until he singing talking middle night nap time ! well , needless say , he he no longer us ! he lives garage . my husband put him out there after he woke my son up , again ! i storing him attic soon . i wouldn't recommend anyone purchase him . he says my son name really funny too . i extremely disappointed this	-1
i hear you , guys ! after choosing all my son " favorites " i finally get it just how i want **** thing keeps giving me " not connected . try again . " message ! i unplugged it , plugged it , unplugged it ... my computer ( os : xp ) doing " i'm connected something " bong-sound , but alas , nothing ! i give up , but tried usb port it worked ! :-) i too so excited this toy . how cool pooh say " ryan " sings cue ... well , almost ... he says everyting random order ( okay , i understand it toy ) pressing his hotspots won't change what he already saying ... it primative talking toy say least . who doesn't like pooh though ? he adorable . battery box sticks out little too far back , which causes hard spot , his shirt doesn't fully cover opening , so i see future problem ... i eagerly await future software updates well . it would nice if pooh would eat meat since my son favorite dinner chicken not cherry pie ! what " haycorns " anyway ? :-) go ahead , buy it . give it whirl , but keep your receipt . my son yet see it ... : -	-1
i always praised leappad products this just add it . these only things i get my 4 year old interested	1
i bought this my son he loves using these pillows when he goes bed . he loves it . thank yo	-1
avid music fan , this real cool toy play your favorite tunes . i am big audiophile , but i couldn't complain too much sound quality drum sounds . they sound pretty good considering there really isn't much competition market electronic drumsticks . if i my way i would design pair sticks simulated real " hi-hat " sound instead ride cymbal sound , i would also make hi-hat sound default sound right drumstick make ride cymbal bass drum two buttons right stick . i would also like able snare drumroll both sticks , but currently due design , you only make snare sound left stick . i would probably add button onto right stick able hit both sticks same snare sound . what would also real nice sticks adjust volume based how hard you hit sticks . lot keyboards nowadays ability it really make difference drums , especially when doing crescendo song or when drums played quietly . it takes some getting used , but i feel like i'm pro drumming these sticks . i recommend this anyone who listens music while tapping anything they find . it good practicing rhythm well really add lot your songs if you choose record your work	-1
my friend brought it over he got it christmas . he likes play drums so i . it cool . , unknow	1
we gave these our daughter christmas . she not put them down ! they sound awesome she so much fun them . her only issue when she lets someone else try them , they won't give them back ! she fourteen , loves music , dabbles our real drumset , but beauty these no one else hear them . we not tried them any other mp3 player , just her ipod , but we love them . definitely worth $30	1
my daughter 2 1/2 when she got this loved it ! my son 5 1/2 usually doesnt play his sister leap pad but loved this book .	1
our 3 year old not like this book very much . colors shapes too small . there too much other information around those items make it clear what they supposed learning . it says it supposed teach numbers , but it only goes up 5 . if i it over again i would purchased leappad book instead this one	-1
we bought this our 4 year old she loves it ! inside very soft outside her favorite disney princesses it . it great sleepovers indoors . i would not recommend this outdoor , camping sleeping bag .	-1
my son received this video his 4th birthday his aunt . after watching it over over 2 days straight , not only our son know sound every letter , but also learned create words . i only wish there video continue after this one , however , it taught my son start creating words his own , within few short months , he reading 1st grade level . he not yet 5 reading 2nd grade books little no help . definitely worth price	1
this absolutely best leapster cartridge ! it includes video putting words together my 4 year old son watches over over sings . there also many word games easy enough my son but also challenge him he learns more ! great product	1
this terrible ... first they control box wired into box it came , so we literally rip it out box get it out ... it not tell you you warm or close unless you 1-2 inches bear ... not buy !	-1

pretty boring . body squishy rubbery any lint , fuzz or dog hair sticks it . only few different ways position him little accessories . after few minutes , kids . lie down because it won't stand up . we gave it away because my kids didn't play it wanted somebody else it . they friend who always took it off our shelf when he came over play so we sent him home it .	-1
i am glad this birthday gift not something i spend my own money . spongebob collects alot dirt quickly pieces not stay very well . far obscene gesture ... i understand why some people may turned off it . my 2 year old who loves spongebob pays no attention it	-1
puzzle needs cardboard backing insert pieces . pieces warped they not stay together . this puzzle very difficult put together out backing	-1
i disagree review says this puzzle not good little kids . i daughter who just turned 4 couple weeks ago also autistic . she loves this puzzle learned how use box cover properly place states . i am glad they individual shapes states . it not jigsaw puzzle . it teaches kids where states located terrific little ones older ones . even i good time this .	1
i bought this puzzle my father who alzheimer disease . he now living care facility where caregivers work keep residents alert engaged activities . some residents don't track well enough even this level puzzle but dad several others enjoy it greatly . today 4 residents ( including dad ) i worked puzzle they thrilled successful placing states where they belonged . while doing puzzle each participant would add bits their personal history when state name familiar them . once puzzle complete each participant stated ( located ) state which they born ... state where they attended university ... other states they'd lived or visited . get this level interaction required my assistance but they all great time ! plus next time we puzzle most them forgotten they've already this so experience success using it all over again . ( family members ad victims look small victories . ) i'm going take them solar system one next	1
my 1 year old given this his birthday . some phrases rude . songs sung off key . rollers don't always play special song when there 3 kind lined up . car sounds enough make me batty . i don't see where it teaching child anything since it might say any one three things each picture . it number ? it shape ? maybe this time it going animal . low volume setting still too loud . only reason i've given it 2 stars instead 1 because my son likes this toy despite fact loses interest after few minutes ..	-1
first glance it seemed perfect gift baby thing all things wheels musical . normally i really trust vtech name - so i didn't look item too closely prior buying it . but it didn't take long me realize what mistake i made . yes , he likes it very much uses it well , it performs well etc . however , i agree there nothing nice how voices speak or what they say - i would never think i would such ' prudish ' view baby toy ! but it rude , it obnoxious i don't like message - if you say there one - i mean - they could much more endearing snippets . there little education it really - songs short lyrics abc song half cut out ?!?!? i could without education toy - but coupled bad attitude - i one thing say " outta ' my house " older version this toy much better friendlier voices helpful ' neighbors ' . vtech should go back old version	-1

i bought this my niece she absolutely loves it ! she play it over over , since it doesn't stick surfaces . if colors all get mixed together it like big ball candy sprinkles . looks very pretty , instead looking like some ugly mess you get play dough or other playing compounds . she wanted floam , but gooey sticky mess so her mom said no . i found this it even better ! it kind reminds me rice crispy treats , how marshmallows kind string away you break them into pieces , only not so sticky . if you considering this your child , they love it ! not recommended little ones , my daughter 2 she just wants eat it	1
this fun kids , although they tired it quickly . no bad scent , sticks pretty good - stays together enough hold shape , although i wish it bit stickier . not messy	-1
this given my daughter third grade , first she intimidated questions . it starts out challenging you easy questions , but they get harder , i see her try harder too . it gives you several answers choose , praises you when you pick right one . it gets harder harder , but kids seem love it . it great long car rides , isn't very loud annoying . shut off switch save battery life . very fun toy , extremely educational ! i even bought one teaches addition my first grader	1
my 8 year old found it rather boring , even after i showed her faster games . she only used it three times , it sits closet . she loves all other leapfrog , but found this drab . i would get one others more than just multiplication	-1
this horse named paciica . she dark peachish color skin brown muzzle brown stockings . she comes 20 red beads , 10 shell beads , 10 rubber stoppers keep beads falling out . her saddle bag pinkish reddish color . it makes great space store beads holds rolled up beach towel green orange flowers . saddle blanket light , washed-out yellow different orange flowers than saddle bag beach towel . saddle red-brown some silver dark brown parts white seat . her stable see through beach scene back , drawn hay stable floor . stable small enough top fit under most beds . if you get this horse you should satisfied , you get your money worth . i recommend cali girl horseback riding barbie go this because she items horse , because she fits perfectly ontop pacifica . thank you reading my review	1

it too bad previous reviewer such negative experience . these work great us ! maybe clean windows our new mini-van factor successful installation ? pros : 1 ) setup super quick . i even able peel reapply order reposition/straighten shade . shades never fallen off or started peeling edges , though we've only them up maybe 4+ months . 2 ) fabulous keeping out sunlight , better than roller shades suction windows because it actually shades or dims light rather than diffusing brightness through tiny holes like suction kind . 3 ) since they're static clings , we put up 2 shades side-by-side our mini-van not any gaps like we when we 2 suction roller shades next each other . 4 ) we actually roll down window these , without wrinkling shade ( or worrying suction cups popping off . btw , one our suction shades won't even stick window anymore ) . but we don't really roll down those windows , anyway , so i can't speak its durability after frequent opening/closing . cons : 1 ) only think one ; it quite effective keeping out light , it bit dark see out , particularly night , ( or gray , rainy days ) mini-van , i need extra careful checking my blindspot . ( thus , 4 stars ) . ** edit/update ** after such great experience first set , we purchased set back january . however , they didn't seem much " cling " , didn't last 12 hours before they fell right off . suspected , it turns out cold chicago weather culprit ! after waiting weather warm up , i'm happy report success ! my husband cleaned windows ( just precaution ) , able re-install shades despite fact they practically crumpled floor our mini-van number weeks before we rolled them up again store remainder winter . lesson : don't install these dead chicago winter ! btw , we've never any problems first set , even throughout winter ( they installed aug/sept ) . this second set looking pretty good so far ( it month ) . if anything changes , i'll update	-1
i enjoy this set because i feel it much different than anything lego ever put into . i like how they fused technic peices , regular legos . i wish they put more detail inside	1
my 10 yr old daughter her friends blast this game . tho , sometimes , there should reward knowing answer without using choices . sometimes they get it lucky guess .	-1
i love playing trivial pursuit junior . questions made kids , so just going school 7 years i figure out many answers . i don't reccommend getting this kids different ages play together , though , because older person almost always wins . like other people said , once you play game 10 times you end up memorizing most answers , it would much appreciated if trivial pursit made booster pack cards . only other bad thing game cardboard wedges get bent handling them	-1
game christmas gift . it shipped right schedule arrived a1 condition . you couldn't ask better service	1
only thing my daughter really liked microphone . rest it just sits there . it doesn't really anything i would not recommend this anyone else . if i it again , i would just bought her sing-a-long microphone .	-1
my children , ages 3 , 4 , 10 , loved playing these puzzles our pediatrician office so much , it difficult get them leave . when we found this set amazon.com, we purchased them immediately . each puzzle comes plastic tray , full-size black white photo outlines each shape , one-piece foam frame outside edges . smaller children put puzzle together right over top black white photo , making puzzles simple enough toddlers assemble their own . older children put puzzles together without using photo backdrop , making puzzles little more challenging they grow .	1

adorable item . my son loves this . it our special teddy bear we use only night . morning he tells me " put it away " until nap time or bed time . very soft . after my son stayed my sister house , her son wants one now too ! after i bought this , i realized you purchase wand it turn light show location . i wish i would known before . yes , others said , battery pack bit hard . it adorable . i just bought this month or so ago , price almost doubled . i don't know if i would purchased it this price - it much better	-1
our 3 year old loves this bear . she carries it around it reassures her night . it so bright she carry it when power goes out gives off reassuring sphere light around her . i didn't give it 5 stars because it battery pack back kind hard . it would gotten 5 stars if they better job cushioning this apparatus	-1
my son loves his glo bear . he 3 just started some trouble getting sleep , strangly enough not due afraid dark . but still this bear trick . 5 different lights fading slowly into one just seemed relax him into sleep . i'll getting my niece who afraid dark this great little friend .	1

my daughter received this gift when she turned five . not buy this game unless you willing spend hour putting it together figuring out how play it . while you're doing , your child(ren ) whining it taking so long . i doing okay until it came time put two stickers spinning wheel . directions this part incredibly confusing , directions how play game same . i also couldn't believe i put stickers die ( first time everything ! ) . said , once we finally figured it all out , my daughter loves it . i think it " secret " aspect game she enjoys -- pick three things out box without peeking look your match your princess w/o showing anyone else card win game . still , i rate this 2 stars poor construction game	-1
i received this game present my wife . however , after few games , one buttons stopped responding , making game difficult play . it returned amazon exchange . one note game , make-it-you-take-it style 24 seconds odd , but addition 3-point shot awesome ! game good i remember especially pro2 . when quiet time necessary , sound on/off terrific . i gave it four stars because durability seems weak ( fifteen minutes christmas morning action results bad button ) instructions written poorly . just followup , amazon shipped me new game even before i chance send defective one back . kudos amazon customer service staff job well ! i'd give game five stars , but cannot seem figure out how change rating	-1
i 7 month old he really enjoys playing this toy . it great babies just mastering sitting everything they need enjoy themselves within reach ! sound effects easy parent ears , too :) this purchase well worth it !	1
my kids i absolutely love this product -- obviously , careful re pieces if you small kids household , but it wonderfully addictive play	1
i just wanted share everyone this one best educational toys you purchase little one . i got this my son cameron last year christmas . we just love this toy . he play alone . he listen watch story tv or after listening story he go back it ask him story line certain page or asks him objects he pick correct answer ... very entertaining . i am hoping they come out more stories besides first 8 introduced . i am surprised this toy reduced sale . i think they need remarket product more stories offer future long it still works this original player . this great toy buy child loves stories or reading . a++++++++++++++++++++++++	1
read me dvd wonderful tool add list many items help children learn love reading . programming remote not too difficult . my son got this christmas when he almost 3 ( january birthday ) we waited program it until he taking nap so he not frustrated while trying set it up . it only took 10-20 minutes program , but i would still recommend waiting until child asleep or busy . my son figured out how work it very quickly first it more reading comprehension . questions story children select correct answer . we also got him couple other stories like green eggs ham little engine could ( we now all but one story ) . although words highlighted quickly , they same pace if you reading story , he still able pick up many words . my son fascinated words within few weeks using this he able read book green eggs ham himself . we thought he memorized it , but he actually corrected mistakes knew words if i pointed them individually . he now 3 years 5 months dvd system 6 months now reading level 1 or 2 ( my first reader books ) reading same level his 5 year old sister . he loves play his " video game " i say i am happy let him play it . recently he even started asking words when watching movie ( closed caption subtitles ) he watching movie he listen point words bottom screen . i would recommend this toy anyone children 3 up . again it just one tool should used help child learn read , comprehend what they reading begin enjoy reading . it not itself necessarily going teach child read but used other items help . i would recommend you buy actual books go dvd , we already most them but way they story read them slower , or able work learning words parent help . my son always takes his books bed him reads using light his nightlight . learning how sound out words basic reading concepts check out website starfall.com it wonderful tool .	1
i purchased this top my granddaughter , who 2 , christmas . she brother who 5-1/2 cousin who 6 . they all loved it played it most day . only drawback , told me my daughter , it sounds bit like train while it spinning , which i am sure kids love , but after while got adults nerves they turn kids attention other toys . other than , i would given it 5 stars . my grandchildren love it , course now it now christmas day , they don't play it constantly , so train noise not such issue	-1

i brought this last christmas my daughter , i also recommended co-worker mine same since her daughter also two years old . two days after christmas two front wheels fell off while she riding it they continued fall off every time she would drive off sidewalk into grassy area or bush . there plastic round piece holds two wheels place , but this piece doesn't fit properly prevent wheels coming off . two weeks later i went visit my co-worker home she experiencing same problem . i got so sick tired putting wheels back while my daughter outdoors riding it i don't let her ride it anymore . not worth money or time ! buy dora explorer big wheel instead , my daughter loves it it very durable	-1

i played this game my kids it way fun . game set up red blue " teams " but it just two people ... answers not obscure i thought they would but varied enough fun child or grown up . i even got one gift my friend who total music buff	-1
this game lot fun . , most impressive thing me everyone get involved enjoy it . it challenging enough music lovers , but simple enough casual music fans . battle bands portion probably most fun got everyone involved . everyone given one topic ... like ' bands start letter . ' then , you go back forth naming bands until one team can't think any more . it good fun money .	-1
i played this game my 13 year old daughter my wife friend . this wonderful addition our boardgame collection . it really game pursuit - reminiscent packman way . great fun chasing everyone around trying escape traps you've set others - gotten caught yourself . easy learn great fun . perfect adults , entire family	1
twice played catch 22 friend house during this past week , i happily say it not strategy game dull , two-years-to-learn-the rules way . it fun . blurb back box describes premise - accurately my opinion - " take money run " . board you're moving around labyrinth-like , token-filled jackpots seemingly positioned every corner . what called `blocker cubes ' effect empowering players ( not mention they fun hold ! ) , they provide real twist play - these devices used players trap/thwart each other . when we played , we avoided temptation using quarters other forms ' real money ' substitutes play tokens ( largely because there children playing us ) , although i easily see why others might not able resist . i also appreciate , unlike most other games i've played this genre , which only designed two players , this game played up 6 people ( our first game involved 4 players , second involved 6 ) . last but not least , you're always using your brain figure out your next move . this gets my recommendation	1
my 6 year old boy obsessed baseball this item perfect him . he absolutely loves it plays it all time . it great toy . only complaint i things you secure it top door little flimsy but it comes velcro added stability . velcro , it very secure not moved . i highly reccommend this toy .	1

this additional set lil kingdom . it includes pink carriage , princess sonya lee , prince michael horse either connected carriage or horse ridden all itself . also included dance area so your little people dance spin morning away ! i've said it before i'll say it again , imagination play so important your child ! any little people set or additional set create hours fun both you your child !	1
my daughter recieved camera gift when she 3 . we only replace batteries once two years regular play . she lost interest it age 5 when novelty using " grownup " digital camera supervision won out over fun sound effects red led flash smile camera . it still looked like new after time , so we happily passed it younger relative	-1

i thought this very cute my daughter loved playing it . then , when she her carseat she threw up , which very unusual her . then i figured out what happened : right after , i noticed she sticking keys all way into her throat . i'm sure she gagged it why she threw up . i now let her play it little , but only if i am watching her closely make sure she doesn't . i wouldn't recommend it .	-1
my dad just loves his new birthday present . we up visiting him over holidays i saw him use his game every day without fail . good job amazon	1
really fun pastime , well presented all sorts concessions people who excellent this sort thing people who need lots help	-1

owoooooooo ! who i see walkin ' these woods ? why , it little red riding hood . hey there little red riding hood , you sure looking good . you're everything big bad wolf could want . listen me . little red riding hood i don't think little big girls should go walking these spooky old woods alone . owoooooooo ! okay , so there not specific nursery rhyme little red riding hood way there peter peter pumpkin eater or little miss muffett , but one look mcfarlane toy twisted fairy tales version fairy tale figure song sam sham pharaohs going through your head well . i think this best looking figure set . ivory white her skin contrasts nicely deep crimson black her outfit , there some nice silver trim cape , accents all silver spikes snaps her outfit . so we pretty much talking little red riding hood mistress bondage or something alone those lines ( which certainly fits requirement twisted ) . i just think mask unnecessary touch . meanwhile , song still going through my brain . what big eyes you , kind eyes drive wolves mad . so just see you don't get chased i think i ought walk you ways . what full lips you . they're sure lure someone bad . so until you get grandma place i think you ought walk me safe . i'm gonna keep my sheep suit until i'm sure you've shown i trusted walking you alone . owoooooooo ! red comes long knife , which fits into her right hand , sliced diced wolf sitting pool blood base . red stands alone without base , but clear intent here you position her so while she continue her assault wolf knife her right hand she use her left so it looks like she holding up wolf continue fun ( my , my , how much inside stomach wolf ) . accordingly figure offers limited articulation : her neck ( although limited hood ) , left shoulder , right bicep , both thighs . you only going find couple poses which she looks good , so sure scope out results various angles before you decide what you want go here . plus you play song while you pose figure same way i am playing it over over again while writing this review . little red riding hood i'd like hold you if i could but you might think i'm big bad wolf so i won't . owoooooooo ! what big heart i have-the better love you . little red riding hood even bad wolves good . i'll try satisfied just walk close your side . maybe you'll see things my way before we get grandma place . story little red riding hood remains one best examples explainig such characters narratives terms their archetypal significance . symbolism woods apparent all , especially when red make her journey into it , which makes it easier explain wolf archetypal embodiment wild . once upon time wolves sacred animals , but now they demonized society trying clean up its brutal past . now wolf identified trickster , well obvious metaphor sexually predatory men , which makes his eviseration symbolic something else well ( but let us not go there ) , so this figure might appeal some customers level well . fourth series mcfarlane monsters , twisted fairy tales menagerie consists not only little red riding hood but also peter peter pumpkin eater , little miss muffett , humpty dumpty , famous tage team hansel gretel ( sold separately ) . given origins most classic fairy tales providing twisted versions not really off point , although these figures certainly takes twisted next level . even if you not want entire set , there should one these figures captures jungian dark side tales we all raised once upon time most appeals you . little red riding hood you sure looking good you're everything big bad wolf could want . owoooooooo ! i mean baaaaaa ! baaa ?	-1

gave this my 4-year-old niece christmas she played it while then moved . it small ; really just big enough her few toys . easy pop-up break down ; great small places small people	-1
we love this game . we played regular uno , but added disney touches rules make game way more interesting . our family , age 11 45 fun time disney uno marathons	-1
my son came home his first week kindergarten speaking this great timer his teacher -- if timer went off , snack time over . period . he seemed so intrigued i decided i needed get one . it awesome - least my two boys ( ages 3 5 ) . i give them 20 minutes get out bed dressed morning 20 eat breakfast . timer shows green , then turns yellow when time almost up ; then turns red . you customize sound effects each color ; amount time allow during each color . my kids responded fabulously timer -- we always time school . i also use it sharing timer ( if they fight over toy , i set timer they take turns ); use it play-time ( you x# minutes play before dinner , bedtime , etc . )	1
time tracker good , once you know how program it . you program standard setting , say you always give child 15 minutes play , you set 12 minutes green three minutes yellow then red . you sounds each segment or slience . if you change times frequently , you either frustrated set it every time , or become really good doing it without instructions .	-1
we got this our 3 year old 5 year old love it . there two different levels play- one shapes without ( so you place shapes your own make larger shape ) . both boys feel challenged enjoy both levels . i think level 2 work much older children because even i work through figuring out shapes spatially . also , shapes magnetic , so great toy road ! all all , highly recommended educational toy many ages- we haven't gotten adult version tangoes yet , but plan	1
out block sets , this one my son loves best . he fifteen months loves jingle bell rattle some other blocks . young child , sound probably most amusing sense	1
i adore this mini changer ! i don't lug baby , diaper bag my purse . now i focus more my daughter ! i wish it shoulder strap , but wrist strap works fine	1
i it it lated awile(1-2months)enough last till it wouldn't open ! other things happened i didn't like don't get it pease it waste !!!	-1
this product much messier than they show tv . it not mixed up well when you get it then goo sticks everything !! my kids mix mix work stuff together , then they didn't want play it anymore . real flop	-1
i bought this my son 2nd birthday he loves it ! i classic radio flyer when i little , so i'm starting tradition ! every kid should red wagon growing up . this one especially great because wheels all-terrain ... great everywhere	1
our kids love this wagon ! they pull each other around yard it next impossible tip over , dog even pull it her harness not tip it over ! it held up very well , we've it 5 years it still holding strong ! only sign wear it got scratch paint ( my husband fault ) it rusted just touch there , we planning fixing few weeks make it look new ! it also works great yard work ! my son loves using it help him his job picking up sticks yard , he piles them high finishes his job half time	-1
this game so much fun ! you learn so much people playing . sure play people you trust honest their views	1
my son swept away description this game he found mail-order catalog . playing it less enchanting . game goes , those who not winning not particularly good time . although dread pirate extremely beautifully made , it not favorite . we've amazing amount fun better games , such zendo chrononauts , playing game after game . there certainly much worse games out there than dread pirate , but there also few tremendously better . buy this game if you more interested quality feel game pieces than how much fun rules	1
great price quick delivery . it great game all ages play together . fast moving fun	1
we so much fun this game . you many people you want play everyone stays playing until you winner . whole crowd gets involved . i would love find other games much fun this one	1
after getting both star scream rodimus , seeing others shelves , i'd ahve say rodimus second most accurate his cartoon form . his cor form dead accurate teh cartoons , one issue i avhe this toy si head could larger teh robot mode wella sthe fact his chest seems higher up than his head , wich detracts his accuracy . other head , toy both modes very well detailed articulate . i never owned teh original hod rod or rodimus prime toys so i can't really compare his transforming those lines , but general rule his bit complicated change i would definitely not recomend him 5 year olds , maybe 7 or 8 eyar olds but i think hasbro shot low this line because i ehar some fot eh others bit easy change more like " shell-formers " tahn good ol ' transformers :p , peeve i this hasbro opted use name rodimus instead hot rod , he wasnt calle3d rodimus until he become teh new autobot leader end movie when he took full name rodimus prime , but i ' am not rating toy it' name , this jsut tiny thing i supsoe doesnt matter much given technically both names used him .	-1
original transformers movie released again few weeks brand new movie follow , new old fans alike delighting seeing some cool new transformers action figures store shelves just time christmas . hasbro wrapping up cybertron toy line needed some new figures release until next july when new movie premieres . their answer create line called " transformers classics " which features exciting new molds many classic transformers characters first appeared 1980 . i know lot us who grew up collected toys those characters pretty excited see them reappear store shelves . it great chance us relive our memories also share them children now our lives . said , meet rodimus . he gone many names over years , including hot rod , rodimus prime rodimus major , even similar character loosely based him energon toy line , but whatever you want call him , he one more well known figures transformers lore . old school transformers fan like myself quickly tell this figure based off original 1986 toy which known " hot rod " . course , hasbro no longer name " hot rod " copyrighted so rodimus next best thing . i always like hot rod/rodimus character because i saw lot myself him . he young bold bit reckless times , but deep down all he wanted chance prove himself . i think lot us indentify . this toy , it obviously takes lot its design original , especially futuristic car form . there few differences but not lot . robot form also somewhat similar original , but little more streamlined . one cool addition this toy missile launcher which actually fire missile both car robot mode . car mode , launcher doubles tailpipe , giving new meaning term " backfiring " . far difficulty transformation , it actually rather easy compared many transformers . instructions they give you aren't best , but once you change him back forth once or twice , you'll see he actually much easier transform than majority cybertron figures also classic transformers . i would definitely vouch this toy few levels . $9.99 isn't bad price all , especially when you consider find original any kimd decent shape would cost you least 3 times much . there re-issued version original but it too become rare again , near impossible find under $30 . this toy also quite fun . i mean , who wouldn't want drive futuristic red race car orange flames hood ? course , us " old timers " , there massive sentimental value well . my advice pick this up while you i fully expect them fly off shelves .	1
go figure . i picked this head because it seemed significant size , lot silky-looking hair , real lashes , fun ( rather than tacky ) features make-up fairy rather than teen . however , her hair very fine actually glued together parts retain her curls . it painful watch my three year old twins struggle get included brush through her hair . impossible . i tried give it once-over help them out , but it tears ends up looking frizzy uneven -- i re-trim bottom . head also tips over easily when you try working her hair . ridiculous waste money	-1
i resisted buying these because they seemed so cheap ... also usual question we parents always ask ourselves ... " what they going them ? " my son received his first bionicle friend his ninth birthday ... it cleverly " bow " birthday present . i now regret overlooking this wonderful line " lego " so long ! my boys love these ! they best time building them even better time playing them . they priced reasonably so you always pick-up one treat during trips out " shopping " . if you encourage your children " save-up " some their " wants " , cost these low enough it doesn't take them months months realize their goal . please not make same mistake i made misjudge these toys . you denying your child great experience . although manufacturer suggests ages 7 up , i not feel child younger than 8 or 9 would able independently put this toy together . my 7 year old needs some help putting these together , but he loves try all himself . point lego , construct play . primary benefit , my opinion , satisfaction " doing it " yourself ! definate a+ our boys ! rosemary	1
toa iruini awesome . i got it earlier comic-con . rhotuka launcher , you take off get better grip . reason they're only two coming out because if all them came out , it would too far past . i truly reccomend this set	1

" customers who bought this item also bought ... " . that bit easily overlooked when one orders item . once toy arrives you surprised know number accessories also needed . it takes lot time finding some , lot more creative thinking others ( gravel ! ) . then this compound starts getting highly educational you teach child handle his/her birthday present way nurse would normally deal patients under intensive care . whole thing little disappointing overall . actual comment this item nothing les than " this package sure nice " . maybe idea interesting , but offer more headaches than fun your family	-1
my 6-year old son received videonow xp his 6th birthday my sister . she also bought him scooby doo interactive movie . he enjoys movie , but gets frustrated getting past each point . overall he enjoys his new toy . my frustration , however , i looked online more videos , it shows them , but says they currently unavailable . i seen past few weeks . target very limited number pvd most i don't feel appropriate my six year old ie , older kid shows . i would like see more educational interactive movies , because after getting through scooby show , i think my son become bored it ..............	-1

this fun accessory basic geo trax system . tower chimes plays music when light sensors triggered moving train . young engineers like how sturdy how easily tracks assembled . just one warning ; it wise also get raised track so 2nd level tower used ground level track	1
our 2 4 year old boys love this tower . it chimes when trains pass under it ( there light sensor points down onto track ) . my 2 year old especially loves he rotate picture wheel it plays songs . this held up remarkably well since we got it christmas . many little hands pushed top button turned picture wheel . it also dropped knocked over million times ( boys ! ) . our windmill broke within few minutes rough boy play crane didn't hold their interest . it chime clock tower saw mill constantly played	1
i purchased this doll my son he absolutely loved . he plays it everyday so me it worth every penny ! great toddlers young ones heart	-1
we bought this our 1-year-old daughter , although she can't all activities , she loves try ! this one her favorite toys her crib , she playing 1 out 2 mornings when i go her room get her up morning . one review said you make this your own . i agree , extent . i * could * make this , but time i gotten everything look nice high quality , i would spent hours hours lot more money materials than just buying it . my daughter loves it , i am extremely pleased it	1
this not what we thought it would all . it very difficult small people use . i would look into book money	1
set very small pins so small they not even stand up their own . it cheaply made , choose bowling set	-1

great lego toy . we bought this set go lego city train deluxe set we purchased earlier 2006 . only draw back amount tracks included city train starter set . it only enough create oval . i recommend buying additional tracks increase joy playing this wonderful toy	1
this toy fun not difficult build seven-year-old i bought it .	1
this action-figure unlike most others . normally when you open box , you get molded guy who karate kick pressing button not much else . such not case here-like all lego sets , this little beauty comes peices ( warning , choking hazard here little kids)that you must construct together form you figure . construction not difficult , but it enrapture kids least few minutes if they experts lego , probably lot longer if it their first experience building . they practice however , following instructions seeing where things could go form new parts become second nature , thus giving this figure high educational value . real beauty you also ignore instructions your own thing , combining its parts other sets form new creatures . however careful storing your spare parts case you want reconstruct original figure again . this piraka when constructed cool zamor launcher fling small marbles over several feet ... but they easily lost , so careful where you this . overall this great toy , if you or your child fan mythos they surely enjoy it .	-1
intex baby float bright yellow inflatable pool float weighs around pound half . one front part float , there logo says pool school : step 1 ( pink ) , step 2 ( blue ) . step 3 ( aqua ) . this particular float step 1 , meaning more learning float infants toddlers . back side float ( behind head rest ) words baby boat float step 1 appear . little yellow head rest inner part float , making it little more comfortable . instead normal round shape so many floats , this float square shaped two different air chambers . first air chamber outer region float . second chamber if inner seat region . inner/seat region float designed " diaper style " , making it easier those wearing little swimmer diapers fit easily . there 5 different leg holes fit little ones into , seating made thin but sturdy vinyl . there 25 pound weight limit float , should not used babies/toddlers exceed recommended weight . assembly baby float simple . mentioned before , there two different air chambers ( one outer float one inner float ) . after finding each valve , open it up inflate float . hand pump not really necessary this float only takes few minutes inflate mouth . after inflated , push valves into place float ready used . experiences intex deluxe baby pool school step 1 i clearly remember how easy it use this float . my daughter chubby little baby , so most other infants floats didn't really fit her . ease , we slipped her into intex float . while float water , she seemed attracted bright yellow colors tapped patted float lot . float worked fine no leaks plenty room lift her out . we used this float entire summer never once any problems it . there also repair patch kit comes float just case hole or leak . however , we never use it even once . float remained sturdy kept its bright color despite many many hours out sun pool . there few things this float i thought could improved upon . although my daughter loved bright yellow color , i thought there could something extra added keep her attention . we've owned floats before little toys attached front where babies could play them while swimming . this float offers no kind attached toy . also , there not handles side parents hold , or even babies . once again , there other floats built arm handles . this made it much easier get grip float while pool . it wasn't difficult keep grasp this float , but it sure would made it lot easier . recommended ? considering trying times we just finding float would " fit " , i would recommend this all chubby babies . also , fact material sturdy we never one leak reason i would recommend this float . i seen better floats out there little extras make floating bit funner , but this one i felt completely safe . if emergency happen , getting my daughter out quickly would not problem . so if you without little extras couple other trivial things , then this great little learner float .	1

near-perfect translation nhl ' 95 , not-so great port madden ' 95 . i'd originally heard fifa ' 95 ( soccer ) supposed here too , but i guess it never made it final product ... i got this last night - hockey some ommisions original ( like players names - here you only get jersey numbers ; i assume there problem licensing , possibly related current nhl lockout ?! ) , but otherwise still same great game , ton fun play . football , however , barely playable . you barely read plays , there hardly any sound ( no crowd noise , poor ' maddenisms ' ) , even music title screen isn't classic music - it just re-used hockey music . design / implementation-wise , i thought they could've made it so you could daisy-chain controllers together , but no - single player version this completely separate product - if you want play two player you buy two-controller version - you can't add later date . this unfortunate because these games ( original genesis versions ) supported 4 players , which course ups fun factor lot , but isn't possible they way jakks decided put it together . i continue love this product hockey game , but i won't even look football game again . if you're old-school fan nhl'95 , then this worth cash , but i just wish they could left out football enhanced hockey ( like putting players names - it hard remember who who back ' 95 ! ) .	1
it ordered my 13 mo old niece christmas ... it ordered tuesday here friday	1
this wagon all great features one their older models plus newly available canopy . my daughter loves her wagon . my only complaint canopy only shades her sun middle day - when it high sky . it too hot walks middle day where i live , but we make it work morning . however , this really isn't manufacturer problem , just fact nature . overall , good investment	-1

" us , only down side this organizer it rather large bulky . it not problem home , but my daughter loves bring her leappad car her when we're go . we end up taking leappad couple books+cartridges throwing them bookbag " in-the-car " use . especially her young , it makes it easier her get them out takes up less space back seat way . i am , however , still very satisfied organizer at-home use	-1

karaoke machine i bought not " offensive " songs mentioned other reviews . we find songs tape fun my daughter hears them radio anyway . there ymca , funkeytown , hillary duff , skater boy . this good music children . plus if parents find songs offensive i think you right put tapes you want your children listen hid or dispose ones it came . i bought this machine her more educational tapes . those tapes just added bonus . there not very many tape recorders out there choose i found christmas time . so we bought this one . my daughter 4 i find age range bit high . she understands how use it thought it easy use 4 year old . sound definately " mono " i bit worried wire canerous one review said , but all wires . even my curling iron said . overall i am glad i bought this my daughter , she loves it	1
i recently bought this toy my daughter , who , way , age range listed toy ( 8-12 ) she loves it . i didn't find anything offensive songs she already hearing radio almost daily basis . i explained my children it not appropriate speak way people , i've never problem . my 5 year old even knows difference songs conversation . when two them play together , they listen music appropriate both . i think its very cute toy fun everyone when proper parenting used	1
i read other reviews before purchasing this product ( thank goodness ! ) decided i would just remove tapes considered offensive . out curiousity , though , my husband i played them after my 4 2 yr . olds gone sleep . i am utterly blown away someone approved this ! i'm assuming only adults reading these reviews i can't held responsible quoting lyrics included this product , but i think everyone should aware just how offensive these songs . one song all how teenage boy doesn't want date girl he singing , stacy , but instead her " mom got it going " he saw mom just towel when he mowing lawn could tell she hot him well way she standing ... i not want my 4 yr old singing those lyrics . but even more mind-boggling outkast song followed -- guy kept telling his girl " give him some sugar " " shake it like polaroid picture " then said " i don't wannna meet your daddy , i just want you my caddy , i don't wanna meet your mama ( said " mumma " ) , i just want see you cum-a . " oh my gosh ! you can't believe my husband face upon hearing this child toy !!! i'm disgusted would encourage everyone call complain this ! if i hadn't read reviews , my daughter would singing ! someone needs lose his or her job over this	-1

i bought this toy my son who loves bubbles . i put it together not make it work . i checked it several times solution not go all way up . i gave it my brother-in-law check out he could not make it work either . i say gazillion bubble solution best i ever used	-1
i would say i agree most reviews i've read . this amazingly annoying lame parents listen watch ... but kids love it . i two girls 4 1/2 3 they love it . they come home ballet class they watch it ... over over again . well i get dinner ready without any trouble ... but songs get ya . when i got it last year it only 19.99 not sure how price doubled this year . maybe wait till after christmas better price or go dancing barbie one seems better made	-1
this great step up . smile . you tell graphics how much faster game progresses , it intended older kids . very educational game content . my only complaint lack games company released . highly recommeded , all games released great	1
we bought this system ( three game cartridges ) our 6 1/2 8 year old sons after doing much research . we would preferred purchase leap frog product ( our sons each own leapster all leapster cartridges ) but we disappointed leap frog didn't offer anything comparable this age group . we couldn't find many online consumer reviews vfalsh system so we counting vtech reputation . my husband i " tested " system before christmas just make sure it would work our 13 year old television ( we plug it into our vcr work ) check out quality system . our 8 yar old wanted game boy christmas again this year ( fourth year row ) we knew we could get vflash system same cost . past three years , we able keep him entertained leap frog leapster system ( which we described " educational game boy " ) but this year , we move away leap frog because he already all leapster game cartridges there no new games his age group . we bought vflash system because it educational features . both our sons absolutely love vflash so we ! i think they low expectations because it educational system but once they got into each games ( scooby doo , spiderman sponge bob ) , they kept saying " mom , this fun ! " they even like jumping bean game , which gotten so-so reviews . thing i really like system they play together non-competive way . vflash system determines whose turn it ( player 1 or player 2 ) corresponding controller becomes active/inactive so there no arguing boys over whose turn it or one " played " other turn . way games structured , it advantageous players help each other because scores cumulative based each player contribution overall score . this system win-win both children parents ! i am already planning buy " incredibles " " cars " game cartridges when they released early 2007 .	1
these perhaps best toys ever built . my two kid k'nex sets keep my [ ... ] [ ... ] occupied hours , every day ! they make , swords , ships , planes , monsters , spaceships , ... oh yes evil robots too ! you name it they make it - what great outlet their creativity !	1

this sandbox terrible . we it one year now it doesn't keep water out even lid . fact , there such large gaps lid box it becomes insect haven ( spiders , earwigs etc ) . wind blown lid off several times . so much moisture got into it over winter because lid didn't fit properly when we opened it up this spring all sand moldy top . talk disgusting . unfortunately , my hubby really frugal so he won't let me buy new box our girls but those you still shopping , my advice save yourselves hassle spend extra $10 or $15 better box .	-1
oh my gosh , these thomas games great . i don't know who thought them up but they wonderful teaching aids . they take many common educational games rework them using thomas his friends . this game you get 4 playing boards ( they call these `lotto style ' boards reasons unclear me-but their just playing boards lol ) 36 character cards . these preschoolers kindergartners play matching memory `what missing ' games . five stars . trainloads fun we found it excellent way teach our little guy take turns practice memory skills .

i gave this my 5 year old daughter christmas . i would probably recommend it older children if you care finished beauty horses ! however , we loved coming up different patterns each horse she still plays them year later . paint brushes not built fine detail so if that what you want i recommend buying brush such things	1
bought this last spring gave it my then 3 year old twins their birthday . all 4 my kids ( now 8 , 5 , 4 4 ) use this daily . they bit trouble sharing however , so i 2 more wrapped up them earn this summer . we never problem ours i love able use headphones it . far batteries go , we use rechargeable so expense batteries initially paid itself many times over !	1
if i could give this toy zero minus durability , i would . i 2 year old daughter whom i bought this toy . my daughter watched it all 20 min before she sat it living room table permanent lines began come across screen . we took batteries out put them back ... same thing . they kidding me when they say this toy durable preschoolers !!! blow your breath damn thing it skip ...

my mother ( she great grandmother ) bought this my granddaughter christmas . unfortunately , her age , she forgets keep receipts . this item not even work two days . when i returned after christmas , i tried return it but could only exchange because packaging thrown away . second video jr. now continually skips if you just bump it . i never find any new discs wal-mart , toys us , or anywhere else . i put complaint hasbro/playskool but i never received any response back how return it . i mean , it cost $40.00 it not worth it . i would not recommend anyone paying something doesn't last long .	-1

great fun all . little shooters parents , too , grin ear-to-ear . puppy dogs carefree bystanders gobble up spent ammo ! it hoot . packs lot punch bucks . remember include mini marshmallows . those who disdain toy gun , amazon also offers marshmallow launcher complete kiddie science book lots stickers decorating launcher . it equally enjoyable . don't forget " ammo .	1
this game lot fun . my son loves all nintendo characters . dominos made very sturdy easy clean . i am sure your child would love it	1
cage well made . wooden balls nice . however , i re-write numbers balls because printed numbers too hard read . there nice cardboard all numbers holes , so you put balls called easily . i am not happy cards . numbers meant punched out , so you only use cards once . so i use cards cheap set their markers use them more than one time	-1
i couldnt find lead time until it too late . i got tubes after i needed them . i tried email true value customer service , since there wasn't number amazon said they couldn't really help . i haven't used tubes yet , but don't want pay shipping/restocking fees . so overall , i am sure product fine , service terrible !!	-1

this not toy my son awestruck , but rainy days or very cold days , this get it use . i think more indoorsy type kid , this toy ideal , but my son enjoys more outdoor activities , this toy doesn't suit outdoors play much . towing aspects mostly looks not actual towing , it keeps disconnecting frustrates my son[and myself well ]	-1
this toy everything - my opinion ! not only it truck ( which all boys seem love ) but it dinosaurs what my son calls army guys ( but they much better than little plastic unicolored ones some his friends play - more like tiny rescue heros ! ) it building toy too !!!!!!! pieces all mix match other megarig vehicles ! my mom bought this toy my son ( who now 6 ) last year it def . gets played most any his toys ( way more than little plastic dinosaurs ! ) - i didn't think much it when she gave it him , but .... now we looking rest vehicles ! we love oppenhiemer toy award toys this should def . their list	1
my son loves school busses , so i thought he would love this . it good quality , but he isn't interested cards come it , he just wants draw , there isn't any place pen this one .	-1
i thought this would great my 2-year-old . it would teach him letters eventually able draw letters . then he received it christmas ... it cute concept , but i so frustrated educational aspect toy . there feature it ask you draw letter then push button . it doesn't matter if you draw letter right or even all . it gives " hooray " either way . that not educational . how kid going know if they're doing it wrong aside us telling them so . if you're buying it educational aspect , i'd say save your money	1
my son 4 1/2 absolutely loves this . it great learning letters numbers . it very durable . it even thrown few times still works . i would definitely recommend this toy	1
i really excited when i saw this doll , because i'm navajo . it something i let my daughters take into school share during native american month . we all like it lot	1

i exploring amazon disney charms my daughter she loved how these looked . i almost didn't buy them because i saw negative review smell . i intrigued bad review so soon they arrived i sniffed them they smelled fine me . my wife who 3 months pregnant couldn't find anything out ordinary either . believe me she sensitive smells . my only problem i bought just one set my 9 year old 6 year fighting over charms . they cord end my daughters hung them there zippers , lunch pail . zippers backpacks . so they aren't just cellphones	1
these best toy ! they given my daughter hours enjoyment , me hours peace !	1
i purchased dvd remote my 7 yo daughter today . remote programmed using your dvd remote . this should 5 second process but took good five minutes it finally program . once it finally programmed we tried playing games dvd . first we went fairytopia , using remote . no problem . then we cross wall bubbles . remote completely ineffective . we even tried using dvd remote , it also ineffective . so , it impossible go fairytopia gameland under mini game selection . then we tried bibble dancing game . yeah , remote works alright .... but response remote so highly unpredictable . it might work or it might not . barbie waved repeatedly it work sometimes . other times it works just fine . yes , we paid attention our distance dvd player aimed barbie correctly . there no such thing repeating steps bibble quickly . dvd remote works just fine this game .... barbie remote too unreliable . save $24.99 buy some other barbie item . only good thing remote wings barbie flap . but , i think it possible purchase barbie cheaper price flapping wings . if anyone figures out how cross wall bubbles let us know .	-1
it true it not quite what i expected ; it looks like series musical instruments it more like soft puppets happen make noise , but if you realize that what it , it so much fun ! octopus " drum " soft enough drum any-sized child , its song ( press one tentacles ) catchy enough we wore battery out . maracas shake rattle , lobster chimes when it shakes . these simple " instruments " smallest children , not realistic music makers . our child loves hitting " tambourine " " drum , " he definitely dances when we play octopus song . so , no , not musical virtuoso your house . , there better . but simple cute noisemakers ( all easily fit back into their own carrying case , way , form octopus ) , this keeper	-1
fart-box not all sound like real thing . it also hard hear not work but 4 tries- i would returned but not worth hassle or shipping handling . save your money -- pleas	-1

( awesome ! ) . i give this set 5 gigantic super-duper , big , bright shiny stars . i highly !!!! reccomend this set ! we need combat ignorance intolerance perpetrated people like one who wrote mean , bigoted review below . let teach our kids embrace other cultures not shun them . my advice	1
we purchased this set my daughters , ages 1 1/2 3 , christmas it really fun addition their dollhouse . set really cute they enjoy pretending cook . i agree other reviews sounds coming oven ( timer ) , boiling water telephone just little bit too loud . this seems case all loving family dollhouse furniture sets make noise . they either need volume control or just turn down volume begin . set really cute , though , i love fact it very new-aged stainless steel appliances . dishwasher cute , but rack little hard get out push back . double highchair cute , but i agree other reviewer it little hard put babies into- you work it little while . i would purchase this again , though .	-1

i purchased this 3 year old christmas 2006 . i surprised when it arrived only one day even more pleased when i opened box see it so big sturdy ! little adam loved it ! very well built toy tonka . even though they don't use metal anymore like when my kids little they apparently still rugged enough hold up toddler boy . lightening fast shipping amazon even last minute christmas rush .	1

this excellent game many people . you use game without board more than six it designed . it equalizer , all ages skill levels play together without feeling stupid . i taken it several parties , one older folks one families . also played it home our grandchildren children , using board directed .	1
wise or otherwise wise choice , it fun whole fmily , game we all play together	-1
my husband i played wise otherwise friend house hunted stores it quite some time . not finding it locally , we ordered it amazon since then enjoyed it immensely ! if you've ever played balderdash , you easily understand basic rules . players write their own ending obscure phrases all over world . some real phrases interesting or educational , many quite humorous ! it game which generates great discussion . our 11-year old daughter able play adults ( beat us every time , fact ) . this would also good party game . we highly recommend it !	-1

we ben disappointed all our other leapfrog products . they gather dust after first day . this one completely captured our five year old imagination though . he takes it him everywhere ahppily practices his spelling words other games . he ramped up level hang-man type game 36 becuase he like figuring out long words .	-1
my 2nd grade daughter , who very bright , struggle spelling because she would get bored typical spelling " drills " i using tutor her . i started looking something keep her engaged while teaching her positive way . i bought turbo twist spelling three weeks ago so far it fantastic . proof ? three weeks ago , she got 10 out 20 her spelling test ... two weeks ago , 5 out 20 . this week ... 20 out 20 , perfect score ! i give much credit this wonderful learning tool . she looks forward using it , i interact her various games . i also hear how she doing listening her play it . highly recommended	-1

we purchased smaller melissa doug set my then 6 , now 7 year old son he loved it so much we purchased this deluxe set christmas . he quickly mastered tricks takes such pride performing shows/tricks his friends . we've also very impressed durability pieces . other sets cheap plastic or cardboard pieces , whereas melissa doug sets comprised wooden pieces , accentuated velvet silky cloths . love it	1
i bought this magic kit my son , who almost 6 years old . he probably bit too young this ( he feels need explain how he each trick ) , but it great magic set . i got it because it made real wood , appeared well made , looked better than those kits " 400 tricks " made cheap plastic . i pleasantly surprised : tricks actually work everything look feel pretty good ( e.g. , hankerchiefs feel like real silk ) . i'd recommend it 7 up . it one those gifts actually good i hoped it would , my son really enjoys it .	1

my daughter received this ride last christmas so we it year . we no problems so far any wiring . she 6 1/2 40 pounds still loves it rides it daily . we no sidewalks but she rides it grass , dirt our rock driveway . i found it rides best grass gets better traction than dirt . my brother also rode this he wights 90 pounds it held up him , although went slower than it my daughter because weight difference . i would say up 60 pound would highest weight get best performance . it go foreward 2 speeds reverse my daughter never any problems swithching " gears " . it lever side you move labeled 1 , 2 andr . one thing i wish they could added working head lights but i guess would drained battery faster . only thing i unhappy i ordered it several months early christmas never opened box so when my husband assembled it christmas morning we found there no battery box . it supposed come one so i guess it just overlooked during packaging but make sure you check ! i ordered 2 batterys polaris site backup battery definately good idea ! we get 20-25 minutes ride time per battery . overall i am very pleased this purchase it held up well	-1

thing amazes me magnetix strength magnets . my 3 year old loves playing them , learning basic physics regarding opposite poles magnetism attracting each other , same poles opposing each other . i wish price lower though . i made mistake buying " magnetic construction set " not magnetix brand , it turned out chinese imitation magnets just 20% strength magnetix brand , so they hardly stuck together you couldn't build tall structures . so if you your child into this concept , stick recognized name brands watch out cheap imports	1

my " almost 7 year " old daughter got this loom christmas thrilled . one best things it it comes small project already set up started so young child jump right into weaving . before my daughter got this loom , she making home made looms out old shoe boxes which means her projects could not get longer than shoe box , but brio loom allows you lengthen project long you like . loom complex but since it comes already set up , you get preview what you need when it comes time start new project . patient 6 or 7 year old master weaving part which rhythmic theraputic motion my daughter finds fun relaxing . however , setting up loom complex involves lot measuring strings tieing each individual string off , so most likely mom get stuck duty . older child long attention span should able handle setting up loom herself . directions clear but please don't lose them -- i keep consulting them . loom quite impressive looking , much better than expected . it looks like miniture real loom ( which exactly what it . ) it made all wooden parts , even very small delicate parts -- this makes loom somewhat fragile . sitting loom or stepping it break it pieces but it appears durable enough handle normal wear tear . all wooden loom looks nice enough leave out part room decor . but if you not want leave it out , loom folds down flat slides right back into its box keeping project intact ready work next time you slide it out . large balls yarn not fit into box but , still attached project , sit next box . box easily fit drawer it approximatly 3 inches wide 21 inches long . this loom cute but it much more than toy ! it would make excellent gift older children even teenagers because you make projects simple or complex you like -- teenager very creative this loom . i believe this loom also appropriate adults -- fact i would like try it out myself , if i could get it away my daughter :) i hope your child much fun this loom my daughter	1

thank you rio grande !!! this fantastic game this collection fantastically updates clarifies rules ! i slowly collected various carcassone expansions throughout years . problem figuring out how expansions interacted each other ( dragon eat tower pieces ? ect ... ) . after researching expansion interactions on-line , i only got more confused ! this game , originally germany , exchanged manufacturers way . scoring rules also changed ( pretty signifantly ) well . so carcassonne online forums you find contrasting information " correct " way score end game . anyway , this box stores each expansion it own slot . scoring tiles ( 50/100 ) starting tile grouped their own slot . " trader builder " tokens there own slots respectively . " meeples " other wooden pieces share two large storage areas come zip-lock baggies separation . underside box colorfully maps out where each expansion should go back when finished playing . rules extremely well detailed full color . tiles marked ( tiny symbols ) so you know which expasion each tile belongs . scoring board kind locks top plastic tile storage container so things don't shift around if you taking game your friends house . i gave 5 stars but there some things point out : box seems unnecessarily large . there lot dead area isn't used . they include " river " ( not my favorite expansion ) but no specific storage slot thse 12 tiles . this disappointing because i mentioned there definately space included slot these . they could also made some slots future expansions or expansions they decided not include ( count , king scout etc .. ) . all all i can't complain . anyone starting out this definately way go . those you who collected various expansions throughout years i highly reccomend upgrading this product . me it worth investment	1

this word game came out hampered word restriction when i played . two players bid down 25 how many words it'll take them get their team say five specific words . success gains card failure forfeits it other team . it tough get people say any words even without time restriction . someone would always win bid some ludicrous number like 5 just take bet , then not get one word correct . fact number words restricted prevented it blurting game like outburst or taboo . i would recommend this game large parties only	1
25 words or less fast-paced fun . i brought this game party crowd such good time it hostess ran out buy her own copy next day . this game keeps you edge your seat really brings out competetive edge . yet , it also appeals those who don't usually enjoy playing party games . let bidding wars begin	1

we bought these toys when our daughter 10months old , her first christmas . she just loves them . she also recieved some old-fashioned " carved " blocks letters cut into them . unlike these , she quickly chewed paint off some old-fashoined blocks . she chomped these pretty hard they seem put up it little damage . she bangs them together , chews them occationally stacks them . though they recommended older children , i think we made nice choice she able play these years many different ways her skills develop . also , they bigger than standard blocks , so i dont worry anything she should able manipulate them little earlier	-1

set up this toy little more difficult than i expected . there lots velcro snaps tie closures work , but if your patient , you figure it out before too long . products included much bigger than i expected . main tent huge what i thinking it would . lots little toy balls included , golf club . after few practices little more than glance instructions , we figured out how close tents back up storage . anyone who owned playhut toy before would no problems closing it back up . this our first playhut structure , so we learn ins outs taking it down putting it up . overall lots fun , my daughter loves it .	-1

this ball great my 8 1/2 month old loves it . he also one taggies books which his favorite we cannot leave home without it . ball super soft plenty tags put his mouth . taggies products all really great i would recommend any them	-1
until now , only movie games i found i could enjoy broad spectrum people scene it ? movie dvd/board game reel clues . both these games their advantages disadvantages . disadvantages these games largely overcome shout movies . this game fast-paced , diverse , generally well-conceived . variety questions creativity presentation make this game tons fun . i played large groups ( 7-10 people ) whose movie knowledge ranges movie buff casual viewer , although there some who frustrated because they didn't perform well other players , everyone least couple questions where they first shout out answer , most importantly , everyone fun . everything handled dvd interface . i particularly like way it keeps score . first time we played , we assumed we would remember how many points each team scored during 10-question rapid-fire rounds . but our pleasant surprise , after each round it complete dvd question-by-question re-cap asks which team answered it correctly . this actually enhanced enjoyment quite bit since not only we not count answers during actually game play , it also gave group chance relive excitement occurred when shouting out answers . game only used three times , which disappointing ( hence my durability score ) . but when we thought it , $20 our group seven over two hours excellent entertainment evening . our case choices table ) all go out dinner ( very interactive , least $8/person , probably much more)b ) all go movie ( no interaction group members , $8/person)c ) play shout movies ( very interactive , $3/person)so it seems pricey , but when compared these entertainment options it really isn't bad . it provided much more fun than any other options probably would . obviously , there always place games played many times , but i know i welcome shout movies gift suggest it future large-group gatherings	-1
i purchased this item after reading other reviews thinking it would good way get know friends better , but after reading some cards it seemed like most cards asked same questions or rearraged wording most . i disapointed cards , returning them even more fun ... i pay $9.00 ship them back company over month later still waiting refund , i finally email company find out what taking them so long they emailed me back saying they charge restocking fee order issue me refund although package only opened , not used . i'm still waiting my refund won't order this company again . overall it cost me over $20.00 try return this product .	-1
i originally bought this my family christmas dinner , where conversation lackluster , but i never busted it out . then i went dinner bunch people who knew each other , but not well . we played cards all night long . people there really seemed like it , it created some great conversations . highly recommended .	1

i only bought this set get two skeleton figures included , but quickly became very attached playset . it very simple straightforward , takes roughly three minutes assemble , no secret details won't show up picture , but it very imaginative too . something castaway setting , its sparse yet sufficient accessories , just inspires fun stories survival battle shelter . i should also add i like rowboat included , find dock look surprisingly realistic . use this man o-war , ice fang , or captain cutlass pirate ship you tell elaborate story marooned characters washed upon small island cursed become walking dead . i don't think any other small " booster " sets pyrates or dragons fosters this level imagination . they're mostly simple battlegrounds fight . maroon gally stands out quite different res t.t he three pirates included fantastic too ! each super posable ( far moreso than figures dragons series ) , each highly detailed face body . amazingly , two skeletons real personality coming through their faces , even without benefit eyes . one looks quite ruthless while other vacant stare simple-minded subordinate . third pirate look ruthless determination his face . these guys just begging star your ( or your child ) own epic adventure	1

collector simpsons games it bonus find this updated version original operation i loved kid playing it brought back lot fun memories . this one better simpsons ' games my opinion . sounds great this its not hard all understand what homer saying . also buzzer isn't loud it original game . don't feel guilty buying this if your adult no kids because i said if you enjoyed original its bit nostalgic . not hard really get even smallest pieces out after you brush up your " operation " skills . children its great eye-hand coordination well .	1
i've bought three these already cord connecting tweezers board come off each when pulled even slightly . also i friend who builds computer chips , steadiest hand you've ever seen , he could only get three easier pieces out after much effort . pieces slip off indentation tweezers which makes frustrating game . i can't see any kids able successful this version game . sounds great , though , very clear	-1

this very pretty unique look yasmin . i love dark hair , dark clothes dark make-up , especially purple ! i love purple ! i like how her purple lipstick matches her shirt perfectlty . i like her jeans blue streaks her hair ( though they should purple streaks i think ! ) i really love mask . i said my review midnight dance meygan doll i think she looks more like she going masquerade party than dance but okay . i would like these dolls eventually . they very unique i like they fully clothed !!!! good !!!! i give this doll 5 i am adding her my wishlist . yasmin you look marvelous darling ! simply marvelous ! go bratz !!!!	1
my initial reaction bratz doll line something like , " uagh , how hideous ! " i decided i would buy couple modify them just see if i could make them better fit my idea what appealing fashion doll . i bought two who original concept i liked extent , so i would willing hang onto clothes , meygan genie magic line , cloe campfife set . i wished less radioactive pink , but they alright . meygan now dressed renaissance maiden ( my first face repaint ) , cloe her way becoming nordic warrior princess . midnight dance yasmin fortunate luck beautiful , me , right out box . she reminds me my days art school where " gothic " style took entirely different meaning it manifestations most other schools . this doll certainly not sort rebelious kid who scratched poor poetry devil into her desk , or doesn't her homework because she out smoking park her fellow freaks . she one people who dresses match cool quiet calm autumn night , prefers philosophical conversations state religion if she antisocial standards her highschool councilers it simply because she bored constant babble most teenagers . many my shcool , she probably fashion design student ^_^ . this not keeping identities other bratz dolls , or even other yasmin dolls , but it sort person this particular doll reminds me . so she sits my customized dolls , her cute shiney black shoes very well made blue jeans ( unusual fashion dolls ) , frilly purple top just so cute ! exuding dark beauty rather than sexuality i think she represents herself well . she one i would not mind gifting younger child , she certainly makes sweet addition any older doll collector little family .	-1
you just can't seem go wrong sweden . they good laws maternal leave , produce safe fun drive volvo cars , continue churn out these wooden wonders year after year . era when toy trains dying breed or made cheap plastic , brio continues produce wonderful magnetic toy train systems i remember my youth . wood very high quality toys " free expression " toys sense . there no flashing lights or talking voices , just blank piece paper child whatever he pleases them . possibilities grow these trains over time well . this good starter set ( i got my starter set 1991 it similar this one ) you add . i know playsets they make vary year year anymore , but i school hospital among other things . furthermore , track placed many different ways , more track added , items such drawbridges tunnels placed train your young civil engineer training . i'm 20 years old still use my old brio set . today it what i place underneath my christmas tree ( my grandfather same his old lionel sets his youth ) . obviously this toy i'll around years come . i got good number years out this toy actual toy back day ( before i started using it decorative piece ) . cost might bit shocking people who not familiar brio toys , but you definitely get what you pay . read brio website ( one i found english uk ) you'll see just how well-made these toys really . you can't find some cheap plastic knockoff	1
i bought this game my son when he almost four learning his letters preschool . it provided excellent way reinforce his letter recognition letter sounds he learning . now he six , we still play regularly , but we've able adapt game make it more challenging him . game comes instructions play two modes : 1 . preschoolers learning letters 2 . older kids working spelling rules include several variations play each mode , so game easily adapted skill level all players . either mode easy setup play . beginner level : object collect many letter disks you you move your ' critters ' around board . each letter disk letter one side cute bug other . players pick bug call out word starts letter back . if correct , they roll dice advance board , they get put bug their soup . if they don't get word , they put their bug back ' pond ' . player most bugs their soup winner . littlest ones , it great way start recognize letters phonetics go them . my son mastered this , we made game more challenging - like naming state or type food started chosen letter . there also variation where die used determine how many letters choose during player turn . player says one word each letter disk selected . game lively fun , we usually let everyone say word each letter . we always end up getting silly giggly , kids never realize they kind doing homework ! there also opportunities ' taste ' other player soups , so you get steal bugs your soup . also causes fits laughter friendly competition . older kids , object game earn most points spelling . player rolls die turns over same number letter disks vowels . all players try spell many words possible selected letters before timer runs ou t.t he age recommendation says 5 10 , but i think even younger kids play if they're learning letter sounds . i highly recommend this game	1

my first impression deck it going most powerful deck ever . i wrong . toon world seems like waste time me . they take long time get going magic jammer or card like , opponent could stop your toon monsters right their tracks . however , if you get lucky you actually get some toon monsters field , you good shape . my favorite card here far relinquished . ritual monsters sometimes pain but it worth it if you get relinquished field . overall , this deck probably just many losses wins if left alone . you may simply want take out various cards place them different deck . if this your first time playing yugioh , not buy this deck . i reccomend begginers buy kaiba evolution deck . hope this helps !	1
i'm 12 years old i play yu-gi-oh !. this deck awsome , but it really isn't starter deck it more like deck higher ranked players like me . but it great deck i would recomend it	1
its very cute , but sound speakers kindof raspy when you volume up high :^( but it still cut	-1
reviewers point out below , dvd good three games . once you played all three , that it . but those three games lot fun . all instructions screen very easy follow . setup time under three minutes . game moves very quickly . there enough variety games keep everyone glued screen all time . even if team opens big lead during game , last round , where teams bet points ( including all points ) , makes game competitive up until last round . game keeps track points screen . it great feature . we played round four people ( two each team ) couple nights ago . it lot fun . i can't wait play bigger teams . bottom line : $8 per game , it great investment	1
i got this game i agree this blast play . however , there only three games one dvd so you only play game three times . so i think $19.99 , you'd better off playing scene it , which way more questions younger players play well because it tad easier	-1
i tried space sand i loved it . kids still enjoying it . they play it over over again . it reusable throughout year next . i gave them each portion it . they measured snow water out bowl mixed it up . they played it , i taught them all snow , water , polymers , etc . forget notes : i gave them mine , so they could good time . i teach school blind visually impaired . i also gave bag it , mars sand , my daughter class school . they played it hours . it pure hands-on discovery .	1

we received this game christmas played it day . our family never laughed so hard during game our lives . later day we " adults only " game 8 adults . amazingly , game still full laughter fun . some adults complained their stomachs hurting all laughter ! we play this game all get togethers now	1
working surface area this unit smaller than original lite brite , but its compact size probably more convenient little hands attention spans . this newer model also features some improvements over old classic including drawer pegs , colored pegs joined into units two , three four pegs making faster plugging easier handling ( see customer images ) . multi-colored array pegs offered format far behnd ? this version lite brite line not same impact original ( which not sale amazon ) , battery-powered light , while low glare , not nearly long-lasting or strong . my thoughts hasbro : 1 . make more theme sheets such examples pictured customer images ( customer images under item picture ); 2 . make mutli-colored joined pegs ; 3 . distribute lighting more evenly behind working area ; both old new models capture all light center frame . but under ten bucks , it still one most engaging solitary games market	1
this review not toy , but service you expect receive amazon.com . if you buying this gift , only so if you months wait , even if item listed available . amazon.com allow you pay your money under guise sending your items , then days later , inform you delay shipping , then week later inform you item just shipped take up additional 10 days delivery . despite site claims item would ship 24hrs delivered 3-5 days . mind you , they're sending it via ups or american home .... honestly , there other retailers out there who more reliable than amazon.com i strongly recommend using them - unless you're okay disappointing little girl your life . i know i hate tell my neice gift i promised her still won't there - even though her birthday passed , almost week this poin	1
my grandson loved thomas engine . he safe using it because there no heat . only drawback it emptied after every use . sometimes time isn't convenient	1
my mom got this my son few weeks ago . i surprised how much he enjoyed it ! he loves his thomas big loader set , but because this set didn't move many things around , i worried he wouldn't enjoy it . i wrong ! he loves it ! he loves pull thomas into station fill him up steam . steam comes out illuminated red light so little ones see it . it also cool steam , so you don't need worry burns . thomas also makes noises it goes , blowing his whistle chugging . track fits together easily , several switches , tunnel bridge . thomas his trains stay track 90% time , but easily knocked off . there isn't much way interactive play this toy - just filling thomas up steam . other train engines ( sold seperatly ) go much slower than thomas , so you need quick fingers switches sure they don't collide ! we found james goes 1/2 speed thomas ! also , small switches thomas make it hard small children control thomas - our 5 year-old niece even some problems needed adult help . adult supervision definatly required . my 2 year-old son loves this toy , but it what it - not too interactive , but he loves make it go push his wooden trains his train table around next track	-1
[ ... ] . overall i'd say it good buy . first i thought my son would lose interest it quickly but after two months this still one toys he plays every day . battery still going ( i only initial charge ! ) . also it hit every time we playdate well . yes push botton difficult manuver so you'd either get some kind clip or teach your child use his/her palm push it down which my son got fairly quickly . some revier mentioned , train go off track if your child moves around too much .	-1
normally , i'm not big fan barbie dolls general , but there always exceptions rules ; this one them . i saw her walmart ( clearence ) i fell love her . her dress just stunning her hair beautifully . her face also lacks typical " barbie " smile , replaced slight , gentle , peaceful expression . she even comes stand so i display her outside box her true glory ; she simply masterpiece . if this just pink label , i honestly wonder how masterful silver , gold , platinum labels	1

after my daughter so much fun reef fish ( which i highly recommend ) , i thought turtle would provide enjoyment well . unfortunately , it no fish . movement minimal making it less interesting , it sluggish water , when you grab any fins , they get bent wrong bent back . it only redeeming value she learned say " turtle " . buy reef fish instead , you won't disappointed .	-1
it ain't cheap price , but it ain't cheaply made either . handle other similarly sized puzzles other manufacturers but it not handle chunky puzzles ( one thick pieces ) , so keep mind . overall , helps us keep puzzle pieces puzzles while non use , it helps keep them organized available easy access	1

this first go board i ever , ten years ago ( looks like it still same it then ) . game go itself wonderful , everyone should learn teach all their friends . this equipment , though , poor quality overpriced relation lack quality . board itself cheap wood laminate -- i carried mine around backpack few times , corners started coming apart . it basically plywood , won't survive ungentle use like solid piece wood . stones cheap plastic things , whereas basic set good ceramic/glass stones not expensive . lastly most importantly , this go set * tiny* ! while make it more compact , it very hard manipulate . fingers constantly bump ( very lightweight ) stones accident , it hard avoid messing up board layout , whole " feel " game lost	-1

chenga great game whole family . any family member old enough understand idea trying not knock down tower old enough play , which usually means anyone over three . there good deal skill children learn slow , calm , careful when pulling placing pieces , which makes this game very educational , least sense learning self-mastery . game also fun suspenseful , each time someone takes turn , everyone hold their breath little while they wait see if tower fall . super-nice feature chenga it allows entire family play same game , without subjecting older members silly baby games like candy land ( which nice , but gets old ) . best all , chenga great value money . this game doesn't cost much begin , super-durable ( almost impossible break ) , unlikely out-grown any time .	1

i bought this toy my six year old christmas , since he saw it magazine somewhere very insistent getting it ( he put it top his " wish list " ) . unfortunately , i could not find it any store leading up christmas , so i purchased it amazon through highlights children , it arrived bit later than expected ( not amazon fault , problem supply highlight ) . it however , very much worth wait ! my six year old my eight year old blast putting blocks together then watching suspense they unexpectedly fly apart . great imaginative play opportunities them crashing hot wheels , other cars , or rc vehicles into wall or tower constructed blocks watching them " blow up " . they also build some their creations then drop them carpet few feet up which also causes " explosion " blocks fly apart . blocks so far amazingly durable . sometimes springs come out , or hinged brick halves come apart , but they put back together relatively easily , both boys this themselves no problems . very satisfied this toy i would highly recommend it , but you likely trouble finding them store , so look get them on-line ( they light so shipping not excessive ) . if you more than one child , you may want consider getting two sets , since this provides enough blocks two children play together sets combined build larger structures	1
horrible product , very cheap . put cabinet together , played it one night product never worked right again . never forget old saying , you get what you pay , stay away	-1
my son got this gift he loves it . he never seems tire racing cars round round . he even likes try push cars up ramps . our experience it worked almost all our hot wheels matchbox cars . there only few either too long make it around curves or two wide go down , but majority worked just fine . some cars go faster than others , which makes racing more fun . only annoying thing track makes race car noises says things like " speed , i am speed " " you're one gutsy race car " . however , you turn sound off or just remove batteries if sounds make you nuts .	1

just got this figure ( via amazon ) i must say i'm very impressed ! huge fan g1 transformers , i felt like kid christmas when this arrived my house . detail extremely impressive it looks great standing next my other transformers ( especially alternators/binaltech figures ) . only problems difficulty getting prime hold his gun correctly ( which other people already mentioned ) slight difficulty i transforming him ( although it probably because i just got figure it doesn't transform exactly like original prime figure 1984 ) . good , however , highly outweights bad there isn't much you knock this toy . parents , i would not recommend this toy kids under 10 but i definitely recommend it any adult fan transformers , especially fans generation 1 .	1

i horrible experience this toy . email i sent company , which follows , explains it well . because it long email i sum it up ( those who don't time read such lengthy review ) saying quality this product amongst lowest i ever encountered any consumer product . many pieces not fit well together , other too tight , one piece not work , piece intentionally made not operate correctly . i enjoyed capsela child , which wonderful high quality toy back then , but now i utterly disheartened garbage now manufactured capsela . dear educational insights : there moments my childhood remain forever blissful . reminiscence playing capsela ranks one my all time favorites . i played enjoyed capsela many years child starting 500 set . later , i got 5000 set , then i finally got 1000 set . i not know what happened my 500 or 5000 sets , but i still 1000 set when i got older . five years ago , i accidentally left it behind when i moved . i daughter who now eight-years-old , i decided purchase 1000 set so she i enjoy wonderful way her learn science : through timeless play capsela . i am appalled what sits front me . i am so disappointed i actually feel nauseous . quality this toy utterly horrific . this horrible experience started motor capsule . connection output motor unbelievable loose ; toy falls apart during operation . it so loose lightest piece , coupler , connected octagonal connector fall right off motor capsule . i thought perhaps this fluke , i originally going contact you see if i could exchange this poor part better one . upon playing more parts , it obvious this no fluke ; almost all piece spectacularly bad . i played half parts , here list problems i found : -- there connections which so loose amongst many capsules other connecting parts capsules parts disconnect during normal play . -- there connections which so tight some capsules other connecting parts it would impossible eight-year-child disassemble . ( i hurt my fingers disconnecting some these tight parts myself . ) -- there octagonal connector connecting two transmission capsules together , octagonal connector connecting two capsules ( empty ) together , octagonal connector connected single capsule . i actually remember my first 1000 set these connections when i first opened it . i surmise this during packaging so these capsules , which separated into two halves , stay assembled during storage . problem octagonal connector single capsule cannot removed . i not try use any tools remove it because i suppose it possible union intentionally permanent . it should not permanent connection , octagonal connector should able removed . -- one crown wheel capsules not work : gears not mesh properly . reason this next problem . -- speed reduction capsule , worm gear capsule , crown wheel capsules , internal gear capsule , clutch capsule all internal piece supports some gear shafts . these support pieces loosely fitted each capsule which causes lot vibration ( gear shafts not stable because it ) excess amount noise . problems vibration noise very bad worm gear capsule ; it so bad noise almost intolerable . -- some chain pieces not connect tightly . result , these loose pieces disconnect during operation , chain falls off gear wheels . ( chain gear wheels used my favorite part this toy . ) -- capsules ( empty ) separated into two halves . these two halves fit together , but not so well . when only one side these capsules connected , opposite end slightly ajar due imperfect alignment . this really not operational problem much it aesthetic problem . there few projects where capsule only one connection , ajar end makes it look ugly . -- there design change wires way they connect parts which receive these connections . first glance , it seem like improvement . connecting ends wires now shrouded . these plastic shrouds tooth which fits into notch either motor capsule , rotary switch capsule , or switch box . teeth shrouds red wires not big enough , such , teeth not fit into notches which means wires not line up when making connections . this not problem since wire not actually need connected certain way , but it low quality attribute this experience . -- although not problem , i disapprove battery cases now fastened screws . this not make easy exchange batteries ( infrequent it may ) . -- it may trivial , but cardboard separators inside box flimsy , lousy job organizing pieces . original foam packaging much better . -- this final problem one which prompted me actually contact you all these problems . rotary switch capsule not work . reason it not work not because some horrible manufacturing . it not work because there wire inside capsule connects electrical connectors both ends capsule together ! this unbelievable ! this totally defeats purpose rotary switch capsule . even person who not any sort analog electronics experience plainly see through this transparent capsule this wire provides uninterrupted current . whole point this capsule interrupt current it spins so create blinking light . why , omg , please answer me why , there wire inside this capsule allows current pass right ? i course analog electronics , this connection makes no sense . you totally ruined this capsule this connection . why you this ? i know educational insights not original owner capsela . it apparent your purchase capsela name only monetary gain . you not care quality product you brand nor scientific , learning experience which this toy provide . you grossly ruined wonderful toy . now instead my daughter learning science through educational play , she gains " educational insights " into substandard commercialism caused corporate world greed	-1
i purchased this game children my daycare . all kids wanted try it all ages , 4 10 , enjoyed it very much . they learn it too , they learned sequence steps involved their turn , they learned examine situation before they suffered consequences poor choice , or rewards wise choice . younger ones especially learned gracious winners or losers , you can't win every time ; but it fun play . also , this toy not too noisy battery operated game , some drive person nuts , this fine	-1

fisher price recently discontinued this dollhouse so you should get it now while you ! i love kithen few other furniture peices built . this dollhouse comes special family speaks when placed special spots house . i gave this item 4 stars instead 5 because its hard find special bonus packages furniture enable house talk . i able buy all them ebay . just expect pay more than retail . i like this house better than twin time few reasons : #1 twin time house boring ! twin time house comes empty- whats point buying dollhouse looks like bunch plastic squares ! #2 you spend more filling twin time house because sweet sounds comes kitchen , family , few furniture pieces . #3 sweet sounds dollhouse larger rooms . even if you cant get all special feature rooms , its still worthwhile get this house because it larger rooms family , cat tape recorder make house talk which more than twin time house	-1
we purchased this dollhouse our three year old daugther last july when she turned three . fortunately , time , i went bit crazy ordering furniture bought almost all furniture sets made activate sweet sounds dollhouse . i just recently discovered , however , you cannot buy loving family furniture made dollhouse department/toy stores . instead , you buy it three five times original price individual ebay ( i.e. , $54 up one set which originally cost $12 ) . if you decide buy this dollhouse , furniture you actually need activate some 200 phrases must contain item called " bonus feature " . bonus feature furniture sets come certain furniture item ( i.e. , wrapped gifts balloons , parrot , blue television , tea set , blue teddy bear ) pink or blue ribbon attached . those items activate dollhouse sounds . yes , you still buy doll furniture fisher price twin times fisher price dollhouse same size scale sweet sounds dollhouse , but furniture not activate dollhouse supposed 200 phrases . personally , i think it atrocity fisher price continues sell this dollhouse marketing claim it over 200 phrases . majority those so-called phrases activated extra dollhouse furniture you used able purchase . hence , claim fisher price ( aka mattel ) makes dollhouse over 200 phrases misleading false advertising because dollhouse only comes few pieces activate dollhouse sounds ( i.e. , adult female , adult male , child female , cat , tape recorder ) . that it ! someone else put together list all sets you used able purchase so you see what i'm talking here ( although representative picture displayed furniture left not always same item boxed picture right -- boxed picture right shows correct furniture activate dollhouse ) . please see : http://mydreamdollhouse.com/fpdollhouse_sweet_sounds.htmlobviously , fisher price and/or mattel believe parents we stupid we don't pay attention details . they incorrectly assumed we not recognize although they sell sweet sounds dollhouse ( probably because they lot left deplete their inventory ) , they don't sell corresponding furniture activate house . why then spend extra $20 pay electronic dollhouse sounds when you purchase fisher price twin times dollhouse much less ? although i already own almost all sweet sounds dollhouse furniture sets , i now developed great disdain unscrupulous business dealings manufacturer who no longer supply corresponding furniture this sweet sounds dollhouse . lastly , today i contacted supervisor within mattel customer service ( 1-800-432-5437 ) . although she very nice , i could hardly believe their computer datebase not reflect corresponding activating furniture discontinued . she totally unaware people across globe cannot purchase it anywhere but ebay ridiculous prices . i not realize when i spoke her there this message board so many complaints this regard , however , i pointed out her i unable find furniture sets ( " bonus feature " ) any stores everyone ebay bidding them up three five times original price ( i think fairly convincing her ) . dare i say omittance word " discontinued " mattel database completely purposeful because they don't want their customer service representatives telling consumers you we no longer get activating furniture because they want you buy up inventory remaining dollhouses ! i'm sorry , fisher price , but not all parents quite dumb you think they . mother two toddler girls ages 2 3 , i am going boycott fisher-price altogether because i think this unscrupulously deceptive marketing their part . i cannot return all unopened furniture sets sweet sounds dollhouse , but i certainly continue raise awareness via internet . final word : if you don't care whether or not dollhouse makes sounds talks , then go ahead spend extra money , although feature otherwise useless . truth , you're wasting your money because you buy dollhouse doesn't electronic sounds considerably less money . signed , mad heck mattel sunnyvale , californi	-1

this game very addicting ! more players you , better , more fun . i say this game played up 14 players if two willing share turn . objective game kill sheriff once sheriff killed , whole game over . this game involves many strategies , which makes it very challenging . what makes this so strategic you could killing wrong person , like mafia instance . there two vice sheriff who protects sheriff . there 3 outlaws , whose goals attack sheriff , one renegade , who basically tries outwin everyone . it may little tricky beginning but once you get hang it , you'll love it . i didn't enjoy it first but after two games , i'm hooked ! try it i'll bet you'll like it .	1

this starscream toy so much better than original there no comaparison . jet mode , which how figure comes boxed very convincing toy jet , unlike some more recent transformers figures which only resemble vehicles because they wheels or wings . robot mode where this toy really stands out , even over optimus prime megatron same toy series . this version starscream almost perfect match character original generation 1 cartoon series . its amazing ans shame other toys this line not close their animated counterparts . robot mode figure pretty poseable , legs nice range movement , arms . head little hard move because air intakes , but it good enough . only thing i really nitpick it length arm cannons . they go too far back ( up over shoulder ) so order guns point straight out you need bend down wings . thing strange , why need firing missiles ? cartoon they not missiles , but laser guns . optimus prime doesn't firing weapon , why starscream need one ? if guns didn't need room springs they could made fit arms closer negating need move wings gun point forward . not huge deal , but little annoying nonetheless strange oversight otherwise increadible transformer	1
girls love all versions bratz . mom , i think bratz dolls look too mature their presumed ages . makeup way over top their clothing only compare " ladies night " . big babyz underware only described thongs . however , finally kidz version improved upon . makeup still strong , but more acceptable . clothing closer what kid would wear overall look more innocent than other bratz dolls . if you've also found bratz dolls objectionable ( even though i still buy them ) , kidz version much more acceptable my 7 y.o. daughter seems like these better than any other version .	1

this game great classic game . but what happened big boggle ? it provided more letters longer words . reviewer wanting lights applause her daughter ... puh-lease ... :	1
my grandmother bought boggle family over twenty years ago , when i elementary school . we loved it , both kids adults ( i still own copy ) , played it often . my grandmother her friends continued play it even after we grew up : her original set her " game night " stuff when we sorted through her estate ! ( it still good shape , too , though obviously much-played . ) course , boggle highly educational ( especially spelling vocabulary ); it lot like word find puzzle . but boggle , letters don't straight line . this encourages players look things different ways , which course helps problem-solving skills . more than educational , boggle really fun . it suitable families or all-adult groups . " grown-ups , " course , easier time finding words ; scoring takes this into account , though , so kids fair chance . timed rounds keep pace up , three minutes per round , it easy play quick game or turn it into marathon session . one cool feature boggle only unique words count towards your score , so it race find long , unusual words or words unusual configurations . ( adults get quite competitive ! ) only drawback : shaking cubes into place very noisy , so don't play it while youngest family members asleep	1
my family playing boggle since i 10 yrs old ! i am now 46 . somewhere line we graduated big boggle ( 5 letters or more ) we always played after dinner , even my grandmother . we needed teams beat my dad ! our set seen better days . we can't seem find replacement ... anyone know where big boggle gone	1

this excellent product introduction instrumental music . kids " play " music programmed violin , or use buttons finger board any variation major scale . bowing action finger buttons great " reality " playing violin . our daughter loves pretend play orchestral instruments music dance . this perfect toy her so she could actually make her own music or " play " orchestra . provided song book quite limited simple melodies . toy durable forgiving . little princess icon seemed only fragile part toy . it not easily breakable much more durable than real violin ! seeing our daughter wanting play more music her own , we decided rent violin started her lessons . toy , this great creative child it also great introduction playing real violin ! otherwise we would never known	1

i don't usually get taken commercials , but apparently i blindsided this one . although this such great promise wonderful outlet creativity , it proved excercise frustration . we even read followed directions ( dilute paint ! ) . nutshell : it takes long time paint travel down tube splatter out end ; adding too much paint create runny mess ; funnel easily becomes unbalanced , shakes , stops difficult control ; colors very weak , contrary commercial ; my kids ( ages 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 ) all quickly moved ; paint congealed now appears permanent part inside tube ; last ( but not least ! ) it stains even promptly laundered clothing . i expected so much more trusted name like crayola . your money would better spent buying basic chalk . you'll even enough left over treat whole family goodies ice cream truck . perhaps melting popsicle would provide better entertainment than color cyclone	-1

yes , we complete entire game which probably shows our stupidity or boredom . painfully played this game six 24 fans . you read every review challenges using remote arbitrary best . you basically guess when you going decide move your player . some other challenges quite good . why they board this game ? it only used if you get past three days then you get play challenges again . someone who completes several challenges gets enter ctu most anti-climatic ending imaginable . if you 24 fan , not buy game . if you enjoy dvd games , not buy game . if you enjoy frustrated because game stupid quirks no one ever tested , this you	-1

you not disappointed this game . i recently , christmas eve , taught two " virtual reality " boys , 13 16 , play this we played 2 1/2 hours then when they left they asking when they could play again if they could get game themselves . wonderful family game . i love this . playing years sometimes pass 6 - 7 hours fun laughter .	1
i actually quite surprised how much fun this play . you play batman one 5 episodes . each episode new criminal . you must unlock first 4 episodes play fifth . i unlocked it , won't give criminal away , but it only 2 levels . every other episode 5 levels before you meet criminal face face . all episodes lot same concepts graphics . you may running room room solving mysteries beating up bad guys . other times you bat boat shooting baddies obstacles . sometimes you outside fighting bad guys trying reach end level . once you played first level , same music you get rest game . repetitive it sounds , it actually fun bat-a-rang beat up bad guys , solve mysteries open locked doors , other puzzles . it wasn't just mindless repetition . grappling hook helps batman climb levels or swing spots too high jump . very cool item . controller saves your progress after you finish each level mission . it not save after " bat " checkpoint . checkpoints only save spot game case you get killed . this prevents you starting whole level over . nor could you save any point . controller shape very good so i didn't comfort issues it . it engage you quite bit some game levels challenging , if not frustrating . it engrossed me long while now find myself wanting solve levels play last episode . there objectives here mild story lines . short , this potential far more robust game , but made late 1980 retro look feel . i wish tv games would gear up us older , more serious gamers . they need start using tv resolution 480 720 . 16 bit color sound would help . i only gave it 4 stars because they could much more this controller game . music wasn't very diverse but doesn't get your nerves either . all things considered , definite " must " your tv games collection . tip : some point jump rooftops . few those spaces too far apart jump . you need grapnel hook . press hold " " , aim diagonal , then release " " fire . swing safety	-1
absolutely adorable playhouse , i get many compliments it . my husband able put it together 1/2 hour i able move it around myself	1
our 17 month old loves these playhouses , but we live texas , most not well ventilated . i didn't want spend few hundred dollars one she could only use inside , or outside handful months per year . this playhouse not only pretty snazzy looking , but also extremely well ventilated -- one completely open door , large window , but it also closeable door window shutters , so she still play open ! shut ! open ! shut ! her heart content . [ see photos get better idea what i mean . ] i expect she able use it though most summer here	1

i like " classics " line transformers . without exception toys this toy line , which made resemble original g1 toys , superior many ways . astrotrain no exception . he transforms into 3 modes , space shuttle , bullet train robot . space shuttle mode he looks part . only thing weird sides bullet train flanking hte fuselage , but it minor doesn't detract shuttle all . train mode , well first off lets say original astrotrain turned into steam engine , which , if you think it what kind stupid , since year original g1 set , most trains diesel ( still ) . i mean why would you combine futuristic shuttle museum-relic train ?. now he turns into bullet train , although not perfect not bad . only strange part if back end looks like it sits up stilts since wheel tips folded down shuttle wings . now robot mode where this , most other " classics " shine . this toy extremely poseable , looks like his g1 cartoon counterpart . only things keep it perfect cockpit sections outside forearms also either side feet . they not too distracting , but they just little wierd . compared poseability original astrotrain toy , however , this new one much better , much more fun	-1
i understand those you who complained upper body out proportion , but there good reason tha t.t hese action figures based artwork justice league justice league unlimited series cartoon network . anyone who seen show would immediately recognize style its exaggerated features . these action figures specifically sculpted based stills those shows . so it true lot new jl action figures won't stand up their own . i don't think detracts any way overall quality product	-1

we resisted buying these because they seemed so cheap ... also usual question we parents always ask ourselves ... " what they going them ? " our son received his first bionicle friend his ninth birthday ... it cleverly " bow " birthday present . i now regret overlooking this wonderful line " lego " so long ! my boys love these ! they best time building them even better time playing them . they priced reasonably so you always pick-up one treat during trips out " shopping " . if you encourage your children " save-up " some their " wants " , cost these low enough it doesn't take them months months realize their goal . please not make same mistake i made misjudge these toys . you denying your child great experience . although manufacturer suggests ages 7 up , i not feel child younger than 8 or 9 would able indendently put this toy together . my 7 year old needs some help putting these together , but he loves try all himself . point lego , construct play . primary benefit , my opinion , satisfaction " doing it " yourself ! definate a+ our boys ! rosemary	1

myself five other people sitting around living room area cabin after breakfast one morning february trying decide something . we didn't want go out because it far too cold nothing open yet anyway . so someone asked if anyone room wanted play game phase 10 . everyone readily agreed play game . rules explained , cards dealt four or five hours later we finally winner . game lot fun time goes quickly . time we realized how long we sitting there playing it , nobody could really believe it . girl who brought game cabin said it more fun if you lot people playing but it also takes longer play it . it goes quicker less people . this first time i ever even heard this game . after rules explained i still big confused how play , but after game gotten started i caught pretty quickly . this good rainy day game when you can't go outside . or one those days when you're stuck home few friends , your siblings and/or your parents don't know what else . it'll definitely kill few hours or so boredom . i love games . i closet full board games i can't get hardly anyone play me . maybe i'll better luck getting someone play phase 10 me since there no board drag out set up	1

my 3-year old got this his birthday beginning september . when asked what he wanted , response invariably , " castle . knights dragon . " well , we got him dragon rock castle , well dragon rider several additional dragon knights . castle itself comes several knights already , so he ended up good collection warriors start out . first all , i've seen this castle listed variably dragon rock castle , dragon castle and/or rock castle . not confuse it smaller cheaper dragon tower found toysrus . this castle big ! it 26 " tall takes up good deal floor space if you want room really play it . play 2 3 hours build castle - especially if your child younger . older children , building it part fun . it constructed * very * strong plastic uses two types connectors attach wall segments together . there actually additional connection points not used if you follow included plans . this gives flexibility customize castle . castle holds together well , but just lose enough under rough play , parts come apart before they break . this good thing - especially when played extremely immaginative 3 year old . note roofs towers simply rest place rather than locking . this also good thing , once you see this toy play conditions . notable point this 3 storey castle . there sufficient ladders doors knights get any location real path . there no " magical " jumping required . other thing note accessories provided . there lot parts many them quite small . ladders , pole arms , shields , swords , but also daggers , beer mugs , torches , fish bones , even some rats scurry . if you're not careful , it would easy them end up vacuum . fortunately , our son really likes all detail , so he very good making sure all parts put away when . far play concerned , this toy gets play daily basis . sometimes solo , sometimes friend , sometimes parents . it visible helped his fine motor skills serves springboard his imagination . he used some his own " pennies " buy princess he could lock dungeon rescue . sometimes dragon good dragon escaping castle or maybe helping defend castle , sometimes it bad dragon they fight . flexibility play limited only child imagination . he now asking santa " good knights castle , " which his term knights errand castle . he want able two castles wars , rescues , etc . summary , this excellent toy hold child imagination . it not politically correct , which i find refreshing relief . it definitely boy oriented lots weapons , armor shields wars , sieges , chaining prisoners dungeon . makers this castle paid incredible attention detail quality	1

i bought slightly different version ( original ) this toy amazon $24.99 my daughter when she 18 months old . mine plastic animals , not touch feel animals , otherwise they're pretty similar . i prefer plastic animals because they very durable i don't worry when she puts them her mouth . she loves play animal toys loves hear animal sounds . my toy includes cow , horse , pig , sheep hen when you put their correct places barn , they moo , neigh , oink , baa cluck . she laughs when she puts one animals wrong place they seem make wrong animal sounds - like sheep mooing or horse oinking . it also comes farmer tractor , weather vane scarecrow . horse also little buggy hay it . my daughter now 3 she still likes play her little people farm , which still excellent condition !!! i wanted buy one like this my niece , but i can't find original one anywhere . i can't believe someone trying sell touch feel version amazon $64.99 . who would pay kind money something originally cost $25 ???	1

recently received this our 5 year old i really cannot recommend it anyone . master mind terrific game concept developing logic , but this version game few problems . most important , slightest bump furniture or board , game pieces not stay shallow indentations board . game over . it really simple pretty much inevitable . also scoring peg tray overflows into secret code location so every time one digs out scoring peg wave pegs flood secret code cave . other comments : pegs scoring pegs color coding not too different size , both come red . pink light purple there also purple - confusing small kids . if you know original master mind , you'll know there 4-peg code , scoring it such " code breaker " doesn't know * which * his colored pegs correct spot or correct color . kid mm 3 peg codes , but scoring indicats * which * peg correct spot which correct color . thus after few plays it close impossible child who " gets " trick not guess 3 rounds , it seems discourage logic exercise since feedback any old guess just well . what i'm trying say even if gameboard well designed i wouldn't recommend game kids over 5 . but given tendency pieces fall over , i would send manufacturers back drawing board	-1

sasquatch fine marvel legends figure . he really tall looks great ! we certainly don't see alpha flight characters come through marvel legends often enough , so he really worth picking up . his body sculpt same man-thing marvel legends series 8 , so articulation/poseability very good joints tight well concealed . paint looks good furry details head toe really bring him life . nicest thing this figure he looks like he right scale most other marvel legends figures . character 10 feet tall this figure appears tall when compared other figures . maestro hulk ( also available this series ) doesn't appear right size . he right width , but not tall enough . i think if they get it right sasquatch , they get it right everybody else . sasquatch comes copy alpha flight #10 . it excellent comic shows you him action . comic , sasquatch battles fantastic four villain , super skrull . it good kids read . this series called apocalypse series because , past series , 6 figures piece 7th , larger figure-apocalypse . apocalypse 5,000 -year-old mutant arch nemesis x-men . he turns out 14 inches tall he looks really , really good when he all assembled . he best one series . most people probably won't consider character selection this series best , so it good idea toybiz release these figures this fashion . personally , i love character selection idea building , larger figure . they should continue it future releases . everyone want put together their own apocalypse since he very hard get when he made his 6-inch appearance marvel legends 7 . sasquatch pretty well stocked , so if you want him apocalypse piece or not , you're still getting great action figure who plays displays well . there version this figure available , but it harder find . ( this one series lots different versions figures ) variant figure called " frozen " sasquatch . instead his fur all orange , it all white make it look like he out canadian snow while . it exact same figure different paint job . you're not really missing much all if you can't find it . orange version every bit good , if not better . if you want white fur , paint over orange version . i highly recommend this figure marvel legends/alpha flight fans .	-1

this excellent chose . his god-father my niece thought it like doll house , but plainly seen it not . my son loves it , it not pink white , so i not beleive it just girls . just because it kitchen sink it not mean its just girls . where problem comes todays life . half men out there not know how clean house or cook , unlike my husband , who it all . so overall good product , wonderful shipping speed , free shipping . how you meet this . if you try going sears , toys us , kb toys , khols , kmart , target , home depot , etoys more you spend $160 - $260.00 more shipping . you see i my homework . enjo	1

my 21-month-old daughter loves this sandbox . it perfect size her friend play . ( today there three toddlers playing around it , it tad crowded . ) my kiddo sits little ladybug head when she plays but if she friends over , they stand or kneel around or it . kids don't seem mind too much since they're just happy playing dirt . :d even 100 lbs sand it it lifted dragged if necessary . i'd say 4 or 5 years old this might too small , but toddlers it wonderful . only drawback me lid not watertight , so when it rains quite bit water gets inside . no problem my daughter though , because just makes sand more fun play !

these cute fun play . my daughter loves fisher price little people . side note concerning eductional value discussion - evolution theory - not fact . it not bad theories go , but it doesn't answer all questions , many holes need filling ( lacking fossil records , inability verify carbon-dating , not one example " missing link " ) . people who believe creationism get put down " non-scientific " going blind faith , but evolutionist exact same thing name science instead faith . there lot real science out there concerning creationism ( this coming skeptic ) , it worth taking look . scientist would tell me not take creationism face value , that fair , but don't go complete oposite way blind faith either - ask questions ! either way , this toy sure conversation starter kids adults !	1
i don't think anyone say humans weren't around when dinosaurs unless they around back then tell it now . information comes same people tell us we came monkeys ... i'm no ape ! anyways , i think this toy lot potential spark your child imagination . little boys ( some girls ) love dinosaurs adding cute little person it just makes it even more interesting . i don't think size egg any reason knock off point educational value . it made fit dinosaur if it actual size it " should " compared momma dinosaur , then it would choking hazard . order create " accurate " portrayal this toy clearly not ( lions , tigers , bears , oh my ! ) , then dinosaur would nearly three times its size smaller dinosaur egg safe size babies toddlers . i think we all know who needs extra point education .	1

i really think you never go wrong mr. potato head ... it teaches kids problem solving creative thinking , while also letting them practice their small motor skills . plus , it fun ! i've caught myself reliving my childhood playing this toy well . i say , 18 months , my daughter still puts few pieces her mouth . so , we took away earrings flower so she didn't try swallow them . one dissapointment suitcase . i thought it'd great way keep all pieces together , but ... first , case falls apart regular basis . it easy put back together , but it pain deal . second , it difficult simply throw all pieces into case - they really put certain way all fit properly . i it few minutes work , but i can't see my 18-month old enough patience it . i gave up suitcase after few weeks , put pieces see-through bin . case nice idea , but it didn't work us . problems case would not stop me getting this set though - it offers lot variety	-1
i bought this toy my 20 month old daughter she loves it ! it turned out very educational . she verbalizes body parts figure out where they go . i also like carrying case it comes . it makes it very easy travel . however , my daughter needs assistance when playing because mr. potato head not very sturdy his feet falls over when trying put or take out pieces . pieces also hard get out once they inserted into head . overall , it great toy	-1

this far best deal i've seen thomas set . water tower retails alone $24.00 bridge $18 ! my son absolutely wild thomas water tower bridge two things he plays most . i am thrilled they combined them into set track , plan give this gift my nephew . water tower contains liquid appears quot ; drainquot ; when you lower spout ( this alone worth hours entertainment toddler ) . bridge 3 parts very easy young hands assemble . it reasonably stable , although top piece not held place anything other than gravity knocked over accidentally . there plenty room underneath trains track . some cheaper sets bridges so low trains don't fit underneath . thomas brand track excellent quality features indented quot ; ties , quot ; unlike less expensive versions . however , it fully compatible brio , imaginarium , several generic brands market . this set also includes thomas train cargo car start your thomas collection ( watch out ! it addicting ) . these would retail $10 apiece if you bought them separately . if your child already thomas train , don't worry . 2 or 3 year old , two identical trains more fun than one . simple figure-8 track layout best young children who introduced wooden train sets first time . you also rearrange pieces make loop or simple circle . i highly recommend this set first train set any boy or girl age 2 up ! great companion thomas wacky track , which allows wider range curve diameters , reduces frustration level beginning engineers	1

my grandson enjoys exploring many options his dj center loves talk working microphone . it seems well-designed , well-built sturdy . parts it simple enough he fun it now age 3 1/2 years . it includes enough options complexity , however , it also appropriate older children . i expect children grow into it play it several years . i sufficiently pleased it i plan buy same toy my younger grandson when he gets right age . my only disappointment overly simple instruction booklet ( mere 2-3 pages each 10 languages only 2-3 lines each feature ) seems lost something translation english . it not clear how use " guide button " feature or take full advantage other options . so one need explore experiment which not all bad , but little confusing	1

my 14 month old grandson car crazy music crazy . this toy combines his two favorites things , once it out box it instantly became his favorite toy . handle back perfect pushing around when crawling , colorful car plays tunes it pushed . he'll also sit play different buttons listens music , particularly few tunes match up his little einstein videos . very durable , easy clean lower volume button so whole house doesn't listen it . a+++ my grandson book	1
we got this christmas when my son 3 months old . we pulled it out month later he instantly love it . he pushed buttons , grabbed animals , smiled music . now 4 months later , he still excited each time he plays it . it good variety different songs , 2 volumes , it turns off if there no activity after few minutes . i definitely recommend this	1
i can't believe how critical some reviews this product . first , this product meant small toddlers . my son 22 months loves this toy . it only blows 10 bubbles time but 18-24 month old child need 100 bubbles ? it easy work my son figured it out after just few tries . it doesn't produce bubbles every time because sometimes he doesn't let handle come back up high enough but 90% time he gets some bubbles . you say wand ? we all blown wand no bubbles come , right ? imagine toddler frustration using wand , it impossible . this toy allows little ones accomplish something enjoy sight brilliant bubbles he made ! final thought , you need prime pump twenty times before any bubbles come it sputter first but it takes all 1 minutes this you're good go . it affordable toy we love this product my house	-1
i could not believe negative reviews this product either . we bought our daughter one she absolutely loves it ! we no problems it whatsoever . only bad thing bubble solution spill out if it tipped over , but bottle bubbles spills hole lot faster . our daughter no problems figuring out how work it it quickly became her favorite toy . it well worth what we spent it	1
i gave this my 24-month old birthday gift . though yet too young really want spend time game , he still enjoys matching up puzzle pieces . this age , it good 5-10 minutes time floor my child . i like fact this game comes tin box rather than cardboard box	1

i bought two these my grandchildren . they love go ride around block or use their imaginations pull it around backyard themselves	1
this nice wagon but we same trouble others - wood sides just don't hold up . they fall out all time it just gets aggravating . wish i would thought all-terrain wagon - certainly would lasted longer i wouldn't so aggravated . assembly okay , but i just think money , you could get something little nicer would hold up better . i'm thinking replacing ours something more sturdier . our little one quite rambunctious things this wagon really trouble keeping up our little one	-1
we this wagon year now . it still wheeling , but paint peeling off there few spots rust wooden stakes sides almost off too . review says not use it rocks firewood because rails small . i would add list 28 pound 2 year old just can't sit still because made wood railings come off also . i guess one their lower end wagons it good deal while it lasted but i am looking into larger more comfortable one now . wheels this one quite small hard manuever unless you street . ( it nearly impossible get up down off sidewalk if there no built ramp ) don't even bother pulling it through grass . spend extra money get one all terrain wheeled wagons .... it worth it !	-1
i just got this amazon because top it cheaper than other online stores i got free shipping it . unfortunatelly my little guy not old enough it yet . i guess i got little too excited it since i so pleased two other toddler plan toys we've gotten him . now it looks very cool sitting top my son bookcase . i really hope he likes playing it future because i would love get him more plan city toys . wood surfaces very soft well finished . it little painted details ( not decaled like plastic toys ) like arrows pointing " baggage , " " departure " " arrival . " baggage belt elevator hand cranked . easy assemble drill or phillips screw driver . simple but very cool . not much more expensive than similar playsets made plastic . used hot wheels or other matchbox cars . only negative thing might blue top dense foam so younger sibling might prone damaging it .	1

quality this set not good . plastic pieces fit well say ordinary lego set then perhaps magnets would able hold pieces together right . also least couple magnets put into plastic housing upside down ( so polarity reversed ) i pry them out fix their direction . my son tried putting toghether this set but gave up even though he builds great models lego knex connectrix sets	-1
this game much fun ! multiplayer games bit cumbersome , since you pass controller person person during play . still , though , we played many hours since we purchased it	1

my three-year-old son requested received this christmas after seeing it baby beethoven dvd . he loves it ! it make terribly annoying sound pretty loud , though ( i guess you don't hear baby einstein movies !!! ) . my husband able put it together easily . it seems fairly durable , although sign top escalator cardboard bends easily	-1
remember shrinky dinks when you kid ? well , this same stuff . it still works like it used . get creative - make some custom earrings or keychains . follow instructions ensure good results . also , when you bake them make sure your colors up , otherwise they stick your cardboard . kids ( adults too ... ) still love this stuff	-1

we received it gift our 15 month old runs all over house it . it takes beating stays standing while it yanked around living room . we not any problems screws wheels or leash . initially we let him play it without leash b/c he would get tangled it , but now he run easily it just fine	-1
purchased my grand daughter ... she loves it takes it everywhere . well made very stable she loves wiggle action	1
this looked durable but proved quite lame my 2 1/2 year-old . it rickety there no automatic power off . batteries last only few hours if left . this truck also not work well manually , it clicks no fluid movement- quite disappointment . i bought traditional tonka next week we use this one store other toys . hand-push truck much more fun imaginative toy	-1
she so enchanting . breitta beutiful wings , but me they only come off if i bang her into something . her crown lites up looks so pretty if your playing night . her hair looks very nice when you first get her out . only thing she hard box open , but dont let stop you geting one best barbie horse ever . baribe fan	-1
i purchased this matching barbie kelly dolls my five year old . although no toy ever easy get out packaging anymore , these most difficult . pegasus most difficult three . i cut my fingers twice trying get it out . my daughter very excited receive this pretty horse but quickly became frustrated because , others noted , wings saddle not stay put ! eclosed instructions recommend replacing batteries upon purchase . problem it takes button cell batteries . i think most people ( like myself)do not keep this type battery hand ! barbie also takes same kind battery . although it very pretty toy , it extremely frustrating . i would not recommmend this toy anyone	-1
while i'll admit it took little trial error set it up fly correctly , i never so much fun r/c plane . once tabs horizontal stabilizer taped correct position i reinforced wings some more tape , this thing just took off sky . my 7 year old i got it up well over 500 ft yesterday spent good 10 minutes just trying bring it down . $10.00 + shipping , you can't beat it . i bought 3 these what it would cost buy 1 , more expensive plane . those complaining material these planes made , most r/c planes ( including very expensive ones ) made same material . i crashed 2 these planes least 5 times simply glued pieces back together flew them again . this great plane money	-1
we several other planes estes fly very good . we decided get this one nothing but problems . one day we flew it it flew away fortunately came back . few days later we flew it again ( perfect wind conditions ) it flew away again this time it not come back . my 8 year old son so upset . all other estes products we tried great but not this one . it seemed like radio couldn't control plane reliably	-1

even though my four year old daughter loves this barbie , it huge disappointment when my daughter friend broke tail off . my daughter this barbie less than day before tail broke . mattel should forseen making tail looks bendable but isn't bendable would cause huge disappointment many little girls . our daughter wants " new " dori . i probably break down buy , but least we know now very careful tail . if you buy this barbie , warn your child not twist or bend tail	-1
neighbor bought this little tikes truck my son christmas when he just 6 months old he playing it literally every day last 11 months . truck no sharp corners -- everything rounded smooth surprisingly not scratched any furniture . i'm bit surprised reviewers children injured themselves this toy . my son , now one half years old , injured himself other toys , but not this truck . we've found it very safe , stable toy my son loves scooting it around house , pushing it back forth me , or hoisting it onto our coffee table . lately , however , truck source increasing frustration him . holding bed truck large , but access top ( due handle ) rear extremely limited . he often put something back only extreme difficulty pulling it back out because openings so small . this only reason why i not give it 5 stars	-1
we owned this zip line two years now . set up much more difficult then directions would you believe . pulling wire around tree tightening it far possible requires lot strength . then , each year wire sagged bit more ... although tension increased easily enough ' turning ' bit . however we now its tightest it still sags . my kids only weigh 50 70 pounds so we aren't stressing it . i am now point where i ' rewrap ' wire . like other reviewers , angle must higher than directions state order ride not stop middle . we 15ft down 5 ft . wish i higher ladder so i could set it up bit higher . even my wimpy girls they wish ride bit faster . ride stops good 8 feet bottom tree so its pretty short ' ride . ' i'll my best since i rewrap it anyway . ( long it doesn't send kids into tree ... ) i am not looking forward job , but all said ..... once it set up - ride worth it ! after 2 years easy use everything still running smoothly - although we oil wheels retighted hand piece couple times during year	-1
this best toy neighborhood ! everybody loves it . i never seen my kids play something so long . we bought it august december they still want play everyday . it well worth $ .. investment	1
i personally attest how good these cards . after playing weekly poker game three years , these cards still feel like fresh deck . normal deck cards only feels new first dozen shuffles , then cards don't slide nice . only different you notice copag cards they never lose fresh box feeling , even after years . absolutely worth price	1

hi , i purchased one these pools my then 4 yr old daughter she enjoy it shiort while , then one morning i went check pool which covered large blue tarp since it not come cover my surprise pool totally deflated whole middle bottom pool gone , apparently crows liked how it tasted ate pool just sides pool . millions millons tiny bits plastic ppol left all over our backyard it took hours my daughter i pick up . i would never guessed pool would eaten ! it fun few days she played it but maybe seeing this review just maybe they also provide hard cover this pool . we left without pool since this gone . maybe manufacture shoud make bottom not so tasty birds more durable so kids enjoy it longer . i heard one other person who this experience well . warning : kepp this pool away birds ! i advised rep amazon purchase reflective tape place around pool ward off birds ! we hoping we not same experience when we purchase family size center pool . best regards , youngs family .	-1
i bought this pool mainly because we short storage space i liked idea how it folds flat storage . mother 4 year old 1 year old , i am somewhat saddened pool . they love pool . i would preferred different one . it hard get sides stay up i find myself pushing them up more than enjoying my kids playing .	-1
my two year old daughter adored weebles since her first birthday . every few months we give her set weebles add her collection . this set , like all rest , big hit ! set includes three weebles figures : little red riding hood , wolf , woodsman . she plays them weebelot castle weebly wobbly tree house , which both loads fun	1
my baby enjoyed this toy infant now toddler . movement encourages hand/eye coordination ball removable . it also plays music sings abc , she really enjoys it .	-1
we love love love this barn ! my two daughters play it every day it held up great . wood smooth well painted we no problems wear tear issues . said ... animals cheap not so friendly looking ! they remind me cheapo plastic animals you buy dollar store ! not high quality we used melissa doug products . so .. buy barn toss silly animals ! we replaced ours nicer rubber animals .	-1
i am not sure what previous reviewer thinking ! course there no nails - this company clearly knows what they doing ! they only make safe products .... i also found barn very durable . my son very rough his toys this barn stood up test	1
these words my son , who 8 years old bionicle enthusiast : he this really huge axe , that double bladed . he this really cool mask which really tall point top . scale 1 5 , 5 really fun ... building axonn : 5 ! i love really hard bioncles buildplaying axonn : 5 ! it really fun play . you play axe , or throw axe make it come back . it humongous bioncle , he really cool	1
i recently bought this my 19 month old who absolutely loves it ! she'll actually sit down play it good 30 or 40 min , take break , then come back it play it again half hour . shapes perfect size her little hands . each shape also rattle , so they make fun noises younger babies . parent easily open sorter twisting either top or bottom , but i think it would very difficult baby or toddler open . other thing i like this sorter it three shapes either end , so baby becomes more confident toy , they learn how flip it over find opening they need rather then mom turning it them . my daughter started out sorter bucket flat lid 4 different shapes top . this worked when she younger ( though she still liked all sorters ) , but since masteed it therefore grown tired it . this new sorter adds new challenge , so it still interesting her . nice feature each shape opening color coded making it easier child find match shapes . it obviously also great chance teach colors . only negative i mention minor one . hole round shape isn't very tight , so sometimes circle falls back out . it doesn't bother my daughter ( i don't think she notices ) , she just pops it back . some shapes need pushed little harder then you'd expect , but that just helped my daughter learn word ' push . ' all all , i'd say it excellent toy , if bought early 8 months , easily last you year if not longer	1
i bought these speakers my [ ... ] daughter her birthday month after she received fp3 player christmas . she already enjoyed listening music , but she uses speakers all time now , now my [ ... ] son listen too same time . speakers so far proven very durable , they dropped our hardwood floors many times no problem , very simple use , my daughter it down less than 10 seconds , so i'm not always help her it . speakers also get loud enough group enjoy , but not so loud i'm concerned she could damage her hearing if she very close . i would definitely recommend these anyone , especially siblings !	1
i wasn't sure whether we needed these speakers but they used fp3 player more than headphones . only issue we button release fp3 player top near handle my son kept accidentally hitting button when he would pick it up , course player would fly out but it kid tough !! once we figured out problem he more careful . speakers seem kid tough too - they dropped few times well no damage . it appers maximum volume like fp3 player which i didn't know when we bought it - highest volume easy hear . we love fp3 player speakers would recommend them all kids !	1

my kids love die cast cars these disney/pixars just success here	1
item described very accurate manner . i not experience any problem ordering it it deliver time . thank you amazo	1
this toy pros cons . description it sounded like only toy we'd ever need , course baby gets bored it after while . he 8 months now we've it couple months . it very durable it dropped several times doesn't seem worse wear . if you forget shut it off , wobbler very sensitive so it eats through batteries like nothing you've ever seen . i two older children so we'd tried out higher settings , seems like they liked it . i don't know if they really understood " pods " when surrounding light bright you can't really see light queues well . overall we're pleased it , if it lasts his first 3 years it worth it .	-1
it very easy paint . planets two pieces so they sit nicely table while you painting . there plenty paint . planets labeled inside , so you make sure you painting right one right color so you put them together right . it easy put together hang . it comes glow dark paint , so night it glows my daughters room . she loves it . i would highly recommend this .	1
both my son daughter loved their leap pads . there many " books " out there each them teaches something different . we took ours long car trips keep kids busy . battery life pretty good you buy replacement " pens " leap frog . but , this big one , they very brittle . i give service life this model 2 yrs tops . you don't break outside , but computer guts machine seem easily ruined which cause system shut down unexpectedly , mis-read cartridges , mis-read pages , or completely not work . never , ever buy one second hand because there 99.9% chance unit broken	-1
this great idea my twin boys love it . my problem books hard find . those i able find more geared towards older kids meaning those kindergarten or 1st grade learning read . secondly , few books like thomas friends i able find their age group wear out really fast . cartridges come book start malfunction after only few months old . i would skip this one just buy regular leap pad	-1
i lucky enough friend let me borrow this my first son when he 3 months old ( he now almost 2 ) . we hesitant first but immediatley this this toy replaced his expensive bouncer swing . this toy amazing . he loved it . i could finally dishes , clean ... he extremly happy loved music . he would lay there kick laugh .... my husband i also realized after awhile , when we would lay josh bed he looked up celing fan starting kicking . it really appeared he trying make ceiling fan move like toy . when i found out i pregnant again i find one these our next son . we could not imagine life without this . i vowed this would gift i would buy any new parent . it really something you not know you need until you try it .	1
my son loves this toy . music fun upbeat he loves he kick his feet keep fun going ! now he sits up he enjoys it even more	1
this one game my entire family agree play " game night . " my 6 y/o particularly likes he able beat his teenaged sister his parents regular basis . great , clean family fun ... just like it supposed	1

my 5 year old received this gift but it took his uncle around 10 hours total assemble it . it around 26 stages instructions around 400 odd pieces but main thing it so fragile . after assembling base trying put next level top whole thing collapsed . this happened 4 or 5 times . there no way anyone under 12 could figure out how assemble this . it looks nice when it all finished but one touch it falls apart . we tempted glue pieces into place so it stays up permanently	-1

every body says phoebe sweet twiin why ? phoebe my opinion just sassy her sis ! i don't them but i saw them toys ' ' us site only $0.14 !!! i geuss them two , goin ' three years !! i also think these most detailed twiins . oh , foxxi roxxi she not bad . one thing spice my collection she sorta sasha place four original bratz . pic sugar+koby makes them seem like couple , witch i think should happen	1
first-ever bratz twiinz , my opinion , most thought-out twiinz . fact these twiinz whole yin yang thing going , showing twins different still get twins . roxxi not very pretty , tell truth , but she normal . :) phoebe gorgeous -- i love her hair ! their outfits very nice , they come more accessories extras than any other bratz twiinz . very original idea , like bratz sisterz . :	1
ive these dolls scince february , 05 , i still like them . i really like phoebe , she nice make up , pretty eyes . but roxxi definetly my favorite ! phoebe roxxi both come same amount acessories , pretty much same , except different colours . roxxi straight , dark red hair black braids , phoebe curly hair black streeks . overall , i like these dolls . i don't think you'll ever get tired them . i sure haven't! i hope this review helpful enough	-1
product very well packaged . shapes fit very easily into openings . only small complaint i top comes completely off . i guess it easier toddlers but i just find it one more item get lost also makes it impossible turn out it falling open . $ i think it worth purchasing .	-1
this one my son favorite toys . he loves hammering it very interested concept getting shapes into correct hole . string attaching hammer so short it makes hammer very hard use , even daddy . if string longer it would probably strangulation hazard , but there no good reason hammer tied . ( if you're worried keeping all parts together there already 6 shape pieces could come out get lost under furniture . ) i cut string off both ends make toy usable	1
i disappointed baby alive doll came so few diapers but cost so much . my daughter could play it hour until we ran out accessories doll put shelf . i've since bought preemie diapers , but you'd think since whole idea doll eating pooping , it would come more handle fun	-1
best part this game conversations . whether you playing adults or children , your friends relatives or people you barely know , you love stories . only difficulty putting it away . i taken game restuarants played while we waited our orders ... wait staff joined fun . when there isn't time game , just pull out cards share your stories	1
my mother brought this game home when i 10 years old my sister 6 . box said something like 5 up . many questions first kisses , dating , high school , jobs other things we not experienced yet . very few questions things we could answer . game really frustrating sat closet years , where friends would suggest we play it , so we would explain what bad game it . i'm sure it great adults , but kids , it horrible . don't buy this game your kids	-1
toddlers searching fun won't look far once you put them table this colorful fun stuff . playfoam microscopic beads gummy texture doesn't dry out or stick your hands like playdoh . i didn't believe it until i saw it myself -- it like magic ! if only kids didn't want mash every color together ~ but once happens , forget separating beads . it still neat fun , i even enjoyed creating my kids . good value gets my 5 star vote	1
this my favorite rahkasi ! i like him because he make things shatter . only thing , i don't like how their legs keep coming off . i am 7 yers old , able put it together myself , using instructions	1

i purchased this game gift fellow lover original settlers catan game . after playing this expanded version i'm not sure we'll ever go back original game . this version take some getting used take bit longer play than original game few times we've played thus far . this expansion set offers additional variety original settlers game there many different set scenarios you play which differ number victory points you need win methods you use gain victory points . it simple learn how play this expansion , but i playing it while before i feel like i mastered my method winning .	1
very good add-on original game . adds nice twist makes it so players work together periodically , not just against each other	-1
this toy comes so many different pieces , pretend play possibilities endless ! there several different poses each major characters - dora , boots swiper - all minor characters included well . there may too many pieces younger children , so parents put some away until those children older ready more complex scenarios . this great toy children who beginning engage pretend play	1
i ordered this my 2.5 year nephew christmas , it probably his favorite gift out hundreds he received my overly-enthusiastic family . its great several reasons , 1- it looks cool ! his eyes lit up when he saw it because it looks like realistic construction vehicle , just his size . he recognized it right away his construction books - he immediately screamed " its estibator ! " ( excavator ) 2- its easy use - it took him maybe day really become good controls , which easy move joysticks . so , its not too complex or frustrating work . evening he transporting his fisher price zoo toys scoop one end room other . 3- its easy put together . yes , moms dads , aunts uncles , it takes 3 easy steps . you just attach scoop , plug it riding part , then pop batteries . 4- aside scoop , rest it kid-powered . so , he scoots treads move . it goes fast or slow your child handle . , since it treads , rather than wheels , i don't think toy could speedily roll down hill . ( although , we only played indoors it)negatives - like any other toy , its kind loud " construction sounds " but i think that half what my nephew loved . its durability - i can't really say , my nephew only it week . either way , i am very happy my purchase	-1
who'd thought pinball mixed basball could equal this ? this antique " piseball " game where players take turns batting , object like baseball ! get most runs ! teams 1-9 players long should prove grand-slam game any audience ! japanese game super nintendo that based off this exact game ! this great game all ages	-1
my opinion this doll " ilike raven simon " . but doll doesn't come enough acessories 19.99 just doll clothes like fashion fever dolls just 10.00 more , i'll wait get her clearance	1
my daughter likes it b/c she like " barbie type " dolls but if intent get doll looks something like raven ... you'll truely disappointed .	-1

this condensed version monopoly might actually better than original . playing time usually less than 15 minutes per hand , there no cumbersome board deal . spirit monopoly ( capitali$m ) remains intact , but game goes much quicker - you don't need set aside whole weekend actually determine winner . i bought this last week hardly able put it down . if you buy one game , this should it	1
my husband bought this our son few weeks ago . my son loves toy but its cheap flimsy . superman figure split side after just one day playing it this keeps it filling up air launching . not it matters b/c launch button never seemed work anyway . it would either not push down or you would push it down superman would just barely lift off . don't waste your money	-1
it fun game . expansion set allows more people join fun . set arrived very quickly -- within couple days . i recommend product provider	1
if you game other couples . no doubt you need expansion settlers . this it . downside it slows game down terribly . more players equals more decisions more downtime turns . but if you got six . you got six . so get expansion . but if you want play better 6 player game , play transamerica , or carcassone expansions . good luck !	-1
picture it doesn't say anything tent twin size fitted sheet . thank yo	-1
my son loves play " pegs park " . premise basic it gets . pick card move number spaces your path it says . first get ice cream truck you win . everyone their own path . trick there positive negative numbers so you move forward or backwards . it couldn't simpler yet it exciting when you're very close winning get -10 ! it great number recognition counting . so simple , but very enjoyable . no branded characters , nothing jumps out you , just moving forward backwards board .	-1
once put together , this toy great looking pirate ship . just don't try playing it . lego pieces not stick firmly together , so even slightest touch results entire ship falling apart . after several frustrating attempts play toy , my five year old gave up it . we finally used model glue glue legos together so it wasn't complete waste money . if you don't time or patience same , this toy isn't you	-1

i got this doll , blond haired one , my daughers christmas . i admit , they don't play them much i'd hoped , i think i got dolls more out sentimental value - remembering them my childhood - than anything else . part fun cabbage patch doll name they come , so i little wary buying them online since some names downright weird , but cpk website allows you change doll name print new birth certificate , so helps lot . amazingly , one dolls came same first name one my daughters ! dolls made same way , hard plastic head , soft body , yarn hair , outie belly button tatooed backside , but facial expressions cuter than older version , hairstyles updated , thankfully	1

we got this bed my son when he 22 months old . we moving bought this his new room . excitement his new bed made move happy time him too . he now turning 8 refuses turn bed over his little brother so i guess we need look into one ! we started out mattress bunkie board lowest level so he couldn't roll out , then moved it up next level when he older . toy box front holds alot headboard gave him place go stuffed animals other stuff . i would recomend this bed anyone , it alot fun my son he still very proud show it his friends when they come over	1
we got this game two others this far favorite whole family !! my sister , dad i willing play this game . it plays more like real video game then others , math learning included . this only game i willing play leapster . i remember playing sonic sega handheld thing few years ago it still fun now . game counting numbers . through each place map there three levels play . each level you get 99 rings get jewel . you don't get anything special if you though like i thought , no secret game unlock , just satisfaction getting them all . through each level it ask you find correct number comes after what ever number they give you , like 123 ... what comes next ? you find 4 . if you touch wrong number it make right number glow . so if your child doesn't know right answer , they aren't running you tell them . then there robots catch you you some special math game , every place map different game . most adding subracting you can't move till you get it right . this might hardest part , even i trouble this because one game you circle some robots add them your bucket but they moved so it hard draw cirlce around something that moving . overall this game must !!!! this game get your kid use leapster sure maybe even dad or other kids .	1
my family game family ..... this good one ..... directions bit complicated ... but even my youngest eventually caught ..... dice cheater card fun twist card gam	-1

parents who judge education systems/software ability keep attention today add children regardless actual educational content may like this . they'll only ones though since there no educational content . " i love birthday parties , yeah " - " they're here , let party begin " - " oink oink " . this all we here these machines when we use them , which isn't often . kids click pictures elicit related often unrelated noises - it . there little actual phonics training . phonics " games " only ask one softball question per minute surrounded lot add attention getting fluff . these entertainment systems , not educational systems . we should note leapfrog brand dvds we not like leappads all . dvds very good . leappads worthless	-1
bit small but great price . works great wooden train sets .	-1

i thought it made wood but it more pressed particle board . screws end up breaking " wood " if you screw them too tight . part chair broken when it got it . i already started put other stuff together when i found it so i glued it together moved . two screws not go all way because slot screwdriver got stripped . one screw molded incorrectly so bad it just flat piece metal . i find screw my own . i essentially build this thing myself . i liked colors table chairs would fine if all worked accordingly . wouldn't get this again though	-1

i'd like echo other reviews -- this toy ( yellow matching fighter , natch ) really excellent . age 37 , i so smitten this toy i bought it other one , , er , play my son , yeah . only problems , fake r2 unit ( although i plan see which my r2 figures fit , based comments others made ) , stickers rather hard put . general , this toy indicative extra effort hasbro made ep iii , compared , say , crap they made ep 2 , disappointed me so much i stopped buying figures while .	1

this backpack great ! my son keeps his leapster equipment all together . easy find , travel store	1

this very cute dress up trunk -- however , glenda witch crown fit me , bad witch really little shirts all three outfits really short -- which problem my daughter . she likes her shirts long enough tuck these definately weren't even close . if isn't problem your little girl , this would probably fine -- just deal size difference witch hats	-1
my kids love this uno . my kids ages 10 12 . we spongebob uno , but they rather play nintendo one . we never play regular original uno anymore . cards very colorful easy see . course , each character uno all unique rule just play particular game . so , it different than regular uno and/or sponebob uno etc . it makes playing uno lot fun new twist each time . highly recommended	1

i'm happy report risk still timeless wonder it when i kid . 6th grade ( when i received this christmas present ) 10th grade ( when other priorities arose ) , rainy weekend or summer day often meant getting together friends epic game risk . we would absorbed game hours . it enough strategy involved we could convinced our generalship , enough chance we could blame defeat dice . we played it enough i absorbed geopolitical lessons questionable truth : iceland kamchatka not keys controlling north america . ukraine not nearly big . our family given risk game gift few years ago . i always trying interest kids game , but my daughters ( 13 10 ) not very interested . finally , my son ( age 7 ) though he might like play . i torn . one hand , i loved game , other , he bit young . i didn't want ruin it him introducing it too early . end , we gave it try . he needed bit coaching , but he grasped basics game play pretty quickly . we blast . next time we free hour or two , he asking try it again . my observations : 1 ) risk not ruined forces time or political correctness . game almost exactly i remember it . small pieces now shape soldiers ( 1 army ) horsemen ( 5 armies ) cannon ( 10 armies ) , but they function exactly like old triangular pieces plastic i used use . map still 19th century feel it . dice attacking defending even still same color . 2 ) my son bit young age 7 . he needed some coaching , but he caught enjoyed game very quickly . 3 ) game still takes long time play . plan taking two hours sitting or putting game aside finish day . 4 ) it more fun more than 2 players . only drawback players eliminated one one ( like monopoly ) , leaving 2 players fighting it out end every game . this means person coming 3rd , 4th , etc ., likely get bored . 5 ) " library " case allows easier storage bookshelf . still , few minor flaws aside , this game classic . i give risk my highest recommendation .	1
i bought ceratosaurus skeleton my 7 year old christmas he sat table all day . he loved finding bones one one . we gave him paint brush wiping away sand he chisels . my husband i can't believe how involved he . he loves dinosaurs , but it activity finding bones makes this worth money . he already asking more . one note : we big flat box shallow sides took one side off put it kitchen table . it great summer outside activity	1
we got this sewing machine my 10 year old daughter christmas . kit comes materials make skirt handbag . we handbag , my daughter fun doing it . she felt great sense accomplishment sewing her own bag ! i help her through project though . this definitely item requires some adult supervision ( patience ! ) depending age child . i would not buy this child any younger than 8 or 9 . my 10 year old young enough she fun it , but old enough she grasp basic concepts sewing using machine . i go step step her through directions , but included patterns not overly challenging . i am somewhat experienced sewing machine , so someone little no experience might find this toy nuisance . overall , machine itself seems well made easy use . it comes foot pedal power supply . my only complaint there no light . even well lit room , we found it difficult see our work area . i found desk lamp basement we set up next machine . overall , fun toy older child .	-1
this game i play my kids or alone my husband - we're all hooked . it simple quick learn , without lot gimmicks you find other prepackaged card games ( " no , mom , floppit only go quirzy pile when it gorpin turn otherwise you pass limburger . " ) i like skipbo because kids often win , not because we're letting them but because they've got better hand , better luck , better strategies ; whatever . you don't feel like you're letting them win - it happens naturally . then they feel naturally smart , or lucky , gloat hours . if adult win , kids usually accept it fair square . my only complaint this game there thousand cards come deck . shuffling no simple matter me , small-handed person . i generally separate deck into two piles , shuffle those , then shuffle them together best i . but it impossible kids their own , makes game setup little tedious very beginning . skipbo flexible you choose play full 30-card game ( takes while , so bring snack choose comfy cushion ! ) or quicker game only 15 or even 10 cards . you play two players or more , though i recommend using fewer cards more people because otherwise game take forever - not entirely bad thing !! why it low-tech , deceptively simple games toys ones we keep coming back time again ? invest ten bucks this game or buy someone set birthday present . you'll thanked many times over form kids asking politely if they cream you once again ... :-))	-1

considering overall age this game it still quite entertaining . graphics acceptable replay device let you see what happened fairly well . would nice playbook or function see diagrams larger longer than play calling mode . i play against computer allow game generate action so i don't use all keypad responses . it takes bit time get grip strengths weaknesses teams 1994-5 but game consistant when certain matchups repeated . all all it not too bad	-1

' horse show ' takes little while learn , but after it moves quickly . if i could change one thing this game , i would put information personalities , talents , etc . each horse backs cards , like herd your horses . but it fun make up personalities , breeds , experience levels other things horses pick your favorites . if you're looking exciting horsey game play , try ' horse show '	-1

i am sick writing online reviews , but i feel obligated write this one because knex 50 model set too amazing me not give it credit . my son 7 ; we lots knex sets , lego sets , every kind construction toys you think . 50 model set totally amazes me ! clever design simple engine , catapillar crawls ( not roll , crawl , just like catapillar ) , turtles " swims " across floor , shark opens closes its big scary mouth , fish flaps its tail , bird flaps its wings , helicopter propeller goes around , course , truck runs . it ingenious ! i am frugal parent , i think $50 lot money , but this set worth it . it like getting 50 toys , except child gets build them himself , so there lot more " fun hours . " instructions great ; my son built most advanced level structures never required my assistance . all construction toys i own , i'd say this one best ! buy it please ! p.s. please don't get knex pirate ship park . i got it because it sale , even though it low ratings . piece junk doesn't work - stupid design . i don't know why , it same company , but i suppose all their designers aren't created equal	1

i read all reviews this product almost didn't buy game until i saw it sale 19.99 toys us couldn't resist . i am so glad i . if you star wars fan ( which i assume you if you're looking this game ) this game must . sure some questions easy but some questions extremely difficult ( but considering fandom obsession star wars even these questions may seem easy ) . prove my point here sample question i though very hard " who darth sidious talking when he says ' i don't want see this stunted slime my site again' ? " most people would initially think nute gunrray but it actually nemodian standing next him whose name i still don't recall . only way anyone could possibly know this dudes name if they studied books . next lot staid repeat questions . game comes 3 decks cards i played game 3 times first set only 1 or 2 repeat questions . far dvds go , they set up 20 games . say you play 20 games before you get any repeat dvd questions . that not extensive scene it games but that still lot questions only 6 films material . overall this game must casual obsessive star wars fans alike !	1
you better know your stuff before you plan purchasing this game make sure you know 2-4 people who know more than they should well star wars universe . some these questions extremely tough there very few easy ones . i used play decipher star wars card game , so my memory those cards actually helped me lot remembering certain characters barely mentioned films . this truly great game we knowledgeable star wars fans finally deserve	1
price , i am quite pleased this product . it used or without headphones . without headphones , turned up all way , there minimal noise distortion . headphones , turned up all way , it not too loud little ears . " play " " stop " buttons easy little fingers operate . my son little bit tough toys , but i expect this stand up his enthusiasm . buy your child cd , record it tape let them listen it their own cassette player ( they can't ruin cd way )	1
my little girl loves music her own cd collection so i thought id get this so she could listen them over over her room ;) this cd player just frustrated her . it doesn't work well , buttons don't always work even when you could get cds play , volume doesnt go up over whisper .	-1
love playing this game ! this great take trip . my husband i rv , we travel lot , this game greatest . this great fun . you not worry pads , pencils dice , just play fun . if you love playing yahtzee , you going love this hand held yahtzee even better !! my husband i fight over who plays next . i need buy one	1
i've mine five or six years i'm quite obsessed it . i've played probably several thousand games it ( high score 738 ! ) , smacked it against wall when its pissed me off , kissed it when its nice , obsessed over hairy dice probabilities , appreciated crisp , functional design every time i use it . only major beef : no " undo " button , so if you hit wrong score mistake you're screwed . luckily seldom happens , this thing more than makes up it number small considerate features built into interface . instance , when you go select where put score , if you make mistake select " full house " when you meant select " small straight , " machine displays score you'll get . so if you see " 0 " when it should " 30 " that good warning change your selection before you hit " score " button . once you hit button you're committed , but least there bit advance warning available . other good : 1 . you use it one-handed either hand , so if you're holding drink or sleeping baby ( or both , it you're type ) , it still playable . 2 . beautifully designed interface , quick learn use , very intuitive . would all handheld games this good ! 3 . very long battery life . i've probably changed batteries ( 2 aaas ) two or three times over six years thousands games . 4 . tough . mine older model ; i don't know if new ones quite durable . but this thing dropped stone bathroom floors ( ricocheted off walls ) more times than i remember it still going strong . few buttons become touchy age use , but this price i absolutely no complaints . highly recommended	1
mcfarland toys pretty good job rendering elvis which difficult thing because his features not easy capture evidenced so many poor looking elvis dolls out there . this doll very much captures elvis action movie completes set i so far .	-1
we got this game 10 years ago , i've just brought it out basement so we begin playing again . ( i'm board game enthusiast house ... but my husband coerced into playing once while ! )for those unfamiliar , outburst " blurt out " game comes 800 topics ( 400 cards since they're 2-sided ) , 6 blue pass chips , card viewer , sand timer , two dice , scoring device slides . object game reach 60 points before other person or team . one die features numbers 0-9 while other green die 1 , 2 , 3 it . players roll dice beginning every turn . blue die refers answer # while green die refers bonus points you get if you happen get particular answer correct . so you may get extra bonus points addition amount questions you correct guess your turn . say , example , you roll 6 blue die 2 green . you then pick card topic words describe police . now , you can't see answers because they're obscured ( kinda like color blind test you take when getting your driver license ) . card viewer red ' decoder ' window helps other person see answers . so let say you answer : fuzz , cops , heat , pigs ( 4 out 10 possible answers ) . they match answers , so you get 4 points . fuzz happens #6 answer , so you get 2 additional points ( 6 total ) . there two plastic sliding " arrows " side keeping track points , so this game very portable . you 3 pass chips you use during game . if you think topic too hard , you pass ... but you must play next card drawn . then , your opponent must play passed card . this sometimes come down psychology because if you think you may awful topic , you decide if person may good it . if they , they really rack up points ! it may better risk only getting few then your opponent getting 10 or more ! not only , you may pass what you feel tough topic , only get card tougher topic ( which happened my husband other night ! ) i really enjoy this game can't wait get newer remixed version ! if you're fan word games like scattegories , taboo , password , you'll likely love this game	1
i am real fan snoopy . i loved see all different roles snoopy plays around monopoly game board . this game fun because you earn monopoly collecting groups snoopy prize possessions . only draw back i there not enough dog bowls ( houses ) , dog houses ( hotels ) , money go around if you playing 4 or more people	1
i just got this figure yesterday local walmart it last one hiding behind all other figures i also found galactic marine but it ripped open all accessories stolen , anyway figure pretty cool it comes figure , blaster pistol , stand , exclusive red hologram figure ( i got darth sidious ) . figure pretty cool , but it should came blaster rifle like commander cody . figure pretty colorful cool blue . add extra detail it few scuff marks legs elbows . shoulder armour , i think removeable i tried but it wouldn't come out when i put helmet back armour loose , so i don't recommend taking it off , unless you want it 501st trooper . but overall this figure fun !	-1
although , yes , questions supposed hard , it not fun if noone ever gets any right ! fun original others some know it others don't . this one takes too long play becasue it takes too long get any answers right . i'll stick my other versions .	-1
my husband i got this game christmas 03 already used all cards . we weekly game nights friends ans everyone loves this game because all questions happened since 1982 . only thing they need more cards this time	-1

very cool ! reading some other reviews before i purchased this product i went out purchased some sticky tack put these up but i able cover both my son ( 18 months ) my daughter ( 5 years)ceiling w/ tack they gave me . you don't need bunch huge gobs per star get them stick . i just put few small goobers stuff each piece so far they doing just fine . stickers not great though . when i opened package bunch them fallen off their sheet all over . my daughter fun sticking them back her door though .	-1

this my first review so bear me . i compelled write it so others wouldn't buy this toy . my younger son who 2 received this christmas his grandparents it truly piece junk . let me count ways : 1 ) made flimsy plastic . 2 ) barn not close completely . also , just few moments ago i " closed " it grey roof fell off when i picked it up handle . all parts came falling out . 3 ) yellow cart doesn't stay tractor . always unhooking . 4 ) hay loft falls off too easily . i'm always re-attaching it . 5 ) animals not balanced . they fall over easily . 6 ) fence comes apart easily . 7 ) when barn " closes " parts still fall out because windows doorway . ridiculous!i'm am so disappointed this toy . don't waste your money	-1
this my new favorite game , although i understand it old game . it like scrabble , but you get change letters middle words make new ones . tiles click onto board so they don't shift around like they scrabble board , they're more securely place . you so much more creative words you make . it more challenge . it also lot easier keep score . if you enjoy magic words letters , you love this game .	1
i really enjoyed upwords once i got used differences scrabble . i think it good game kids when they get little older , too . only reason i didn't give it 5 stars because i wish board little bigger . also , there no cloth bag hold letter tiles , so you really make sure they're all face-down lid while you play	-1
we bought this our son last christmas it broken within 3 weeks !!! this unacceptable any toy , much less one i paid $20 !! page middle switches modes just stopped working no reason whatsoever . my son never broken toy we own many fisher price leapfrog toys . i tried exchange it many many times store never got it back stock . i tried contact vtech via email my email returned undeliverable . it cute idea , especially how song " voice " changes when you touch different animal , but safety issue pig how hard it little ones move sheep , it just not worth it . we bought vtech toy last christmas well ( sing discover piano ) it broke within 2 months . i never buy vtech toy !! there much better toys out there . don't waste your money !	-1
before i start my review , i noticed latest version this toy apparently differs slightly visually than one pictured here amazon . my guess there may two versions this toy out , or one i purchased most recent incarnation . my review this current version march 2006 . short , this excellent toy developing infant , because it provides good panoply learning sound effects songs go blinking lights , functional keyboard learn new music skills . advertising this toy states , ' discovery nursery farm ' many developmental benefit functions , such developing motor skills , visual awareness , language development , imaginative play thru realistic animal sounds nursery rhymes infants love hear . even though our infant only 7 months old ( box it came says it infants " 9+ months " ) , she loves this toy , evidenced her many smiles , giggles , ' razzing ' , overall attention she pays it . we thankfully no issues fingers getting stuck , or other safety issues . perhaps newer version effectively addressed this previous safety issue some reviewers brought up here . addition , ergonomically , this great toy infant who loves spend lot time his/her tummy . toy their level physically , they play it easily while lying down well sitting up , all buttons keys well within their reach . lighter subject singer wee bit ' off key ' , strange voice ( some reviewers mentioned ) , this really ' non-issue ' . fact , his interesting voice sounds kind appropriately goofy perfectly fit fun child toy . then again , compared hearing english language butchered ' raped ' so many times ever since moving state ohio 10 years ago , his voice excellent ! great job ' vtech'!!	1

this game so much fun - yes , some songs pretty old , but categories diverse . there traditional tunes like christmas carols , family songs , broadway tunes , tv/ movies most contemporary tunes - i'm pretty sure they maybe late70s - early/mid 90 . if you're 10 years old , you may not recognize much more than traditional - even my three year old knew some those . point you die laughing person who tries so hard hum their tune no one clue ! even absolute worst singer or hummer matter blast this game !!! we play guys against girls - that awesome . my sister 20 she knows most songs - they aren't prehistoric tunes . this game so much fun - you should totally get it	-1
our 6-year-old son just loves this game ! it super easy assemble , easy learn how play , games go fairly quickly exciting . plus it doesn't make all those noises almost all new , electronic toys make . it seems pretty durable well-made we're very happy what we got price .	1
ok , not getting anything else . this game played solo or friend . great hand/eye coordination . great game	1

( look more sets matching kitchen online , they're sooo cute ! ) pop-up action toaster works great . colors really pretty painted finish held up 9-month-old chewing it . my only complaint set i received knife broken velcro one pat butter came off first time we tried " cut " it . both simple repairs - hopefully it doesn't indicate general lack durability .

any little barbie fan and/or horse lover love this doll . it really cute sure hit ! sharon ( grandma 4 grand-daughters -- they loved this barbie	1
this really cool doll , her clothes really neat , they realistic western styled . she alo comes bucket two grooming brushes which fun if you buy her horse- pacifica . last reviewer , who said amazon doesn't sell her horse- they , don't listen this reviewer , they wrong . http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/b0006jmfm6/ref=pd_sim_toys_1/002-2628051-5108864?v=glances=toysn=12931421 this link page her horse . overall this doll so cool , she comes her denim jacket , 2 tops , her 3/4 pants , cowboy boots , bag , ' stand store ' case really cool well . recommended !!!!	1
i love this set , my 3 year old who received it last year . make no mistake though ... this real set , not play set . i didn't read recommended age when i bought it ( got it when it sale must too eager purchase it ) didn't realize pie plate ceramic . so obviously 2 year old cannot play it alone . my daughter uses it her play room now she old enough careful it we going try actually bake something it before too long . great grow-with-me set	-1
my son loves tornados . i mean loves tornados . so pet tornado great . it easy , cheap , travel friendly .	1
i'm huge monopoly fan , huge family guy fan . i've waiting family guy monopoly come out years , now it finally here ... yippee !!!!! i hope this game good i thought it . would nicer if it more tokens than just griffin family ( e.i. quagmire , cleveland , joe , mayor west ) , but i'm sure it still great game .	1
this esweetie . whole genie magic collection great . seeing theese dolls stores shows you how pretty they . i want all collection . thanks lenzie , you nice !! [ ...	1
iron fist very good action figure . i think he one best this series . his body sculpt appears new one . articulation great joints tight well concealed . paint job details this martial arts master just fine , too . i'm sure it wasn't too hard because he doesn't real flashy costume or anything . but , toybiz stay true his look comic books . i'm very thankful they didn't airbrush this figure death color all light areas shadows-like they past couple series . iron fist comes copy iron fist #8 . it very good giving you glimpse him action what drives him . he also couple plastic " flames " fit his hands simulate his power making his fists impervious ( hence , name " iron fist " ) . they don't fit well , but look nice if you get them stay . my kids don't really use them much , so you take them or leave them . this series called apocalypse series because , past series , 6 figures piece 7th , larger figure-apocalypse . apocalypse 5,000 -year-old mutant arch nemesis x-men . he turns out 14 inches tall he looks really , really good when he all assembled . he best one series . most people probably won't consider character selection this series best , so it good idea toybiz release these figures this fashion . personally , i love character selection idea building , larger figure . they should continue it future releases . everyone want put together their own apocalypse since he very hard get when he made his 6-inch appearance marvel legends 7 . iron fist pretty well stocked , so if you want him apocalypse piece or not , you're still getting nice action figure who plays displays nicely . there version this figure available , but it harder find than this one . ( this one series lots different versions figures ) iron fist red costume instead green head sculpt his mouth opened few tears out his mask . you're not really missing much all if you can't find it . green version every bit good , if not better . only thing missing power man a.k.a. luke cage go alongside him . here hoping heroes hire teamed up soon marvel legends style	-1

when my son first wanted this toy , i thought he silly . he loves this thing , he seven . first i thought noises this toy made annoying , but after seeing actual baby panda t.v. , hearing it , they sound exactly same . whimpering little noises it makes sounds just like real baby panda . if i hadn't seen this animal planet , i would thought this toy annoying stupid . he blinks , sucks , makes cute baby panda sounds . he even moves his paws . he some mechanical noises while it gears run during leg movements , but other than , it adorable . my son loves taking care " baby he saw animal planet " , likes interacting it . it easily shut off switch his back , his skin baggy enough his back , we open velcro back there when not use , we store panda bottle his back skin . it fits perfectly back there , ready used when you switch him back , you just open his back velcro his bottle ready too . it good way not misplace such small item . we this item since it came out last year , it well loved .	1

1 . what purpose this seat ( seats like these) ? seats like these marketed " infant positioning support " or similar . intent help you teach your child sit up . it tool you use while your sitting your child floor . you shouldn't leave infant side when they these seats , because they liable tip over . directions state seat should placed solid surface , so you need there keep your baby tipping bumping his/her head floor . you don't want use this seat table or any raised surface . you cannot use it your bed , because unstable surface cause it tip right over . 2 . when would i use this seat ? i'm sure you sat floor your baby supported your legs . maybe you used couple pillows help you support your infant . this seat same thing . if you want feed your child infant cereal this seat , remember set seat floor -- never kitchen table . 3 . my child right developmental stage this seat ? there very small window which you would use this seat . it approved infants 9-22 lbs , but i think gives wrong idea . your baby need strong enough " supported sitter " but not developed into " self-sitter . " i'm getting these terms gerber infant cereal box . " supported sitter " hold his/her head up his/her own . i don't know any 9 lb babies " supported sitters . " " self sitters " too strong these chairs . " self sitters " likely rip off front pummel and/or learn flipping thing over gets big fun reaction out mommy .	-1
my baby loved this seat ! it perfect 4-7 month range when babies they aren't content lie around anymore , but can't yet sit up . fun feeding , reading books , playing teething toys more ! design genius - no cumbersome straps once . i love unobtrusive green color ..	1

i really love this remake classic ram jet . my parents bought me g1 version 1987 when i high school still into trans-formers toys . even though he wasn't what i really wanted christmas gift ( i wanted " thrust " ) , i cool him . g1 issues rear wing weight balance , but i just kept him robot mode . unfortunately , my brother gave all my transformers away while i basic training after high school . i wanted choke him ! now , this classic issue , i love color scheme . he seems meaner look his eyes than starscream , cone head deletes irritating yellow windscreen seen above head when starscream robot mode . he few issues himself , especially beginning wings leading edge restricting full downward position arms no nose landing gear or opening canopy , but i like this one better than starscream . description it says you flip down landing gear , but i haven't seen any yet . but , it look like there place it . i also ordered classic version skywarp normally sold ultra magnus " battle autobot city " set . i found it e-bay out magnus . hopefully , hasbro continue issue classics like thundercracker , thrust , sunstorm , just maybe other 3 seekers seen cartoon .	1

this toy da bomb ! it tons fun play miniature edgar allen poe action figure . it fits same scale all my gijoes . means it goes great when you big battle against cobra : enemy your bedroom ( or even bathtub ) . when i play , i pretend duke took bullet went down , edgar allen poe took his place leader . this fits perfectly gijoe story . eap then goes fight cobra , until it ends final showdown him storm shadow . edgar allen poe uses his ninja skills kick storm shadow rear , then goes destroy cobra commander one-on-one duel . handle destro zartan , poe simply commands his raven . they move attack , raven shouts " nevermore ! " then swoops down pluck out their eyes . ( eye-plucking quite effective battle , way . ) then cobra : enemy destroyed , all good guys shout , " yo ! joe ! " finally , we find out duke wasn't really dead , but simply coma . so edgar allen poe gracefully relinquishes command troops , vows one day , should he ever needed fight injustice again , he shall return . so basically , what i am trying say this toy lot fun . buy it today	1

paintworks produces quality paint-by-numbers kit , this one no exception ... however , i wish they'd package these smaller brush . there no way monster-sized brush useful filling anything but largest sky pieces . you better off ditching brush buying smallest acrylic brush you find . i also bit disappointed size cartoons this one . finished product little blocky which not what i come expect paintworks kit . also , usual , number wear off paint-pots long before you finish piece so you better off getting permanent marker marking numbers bottom pot before beginning . 4 stars	-1

here we build figure series marvel legends . falcon fly empathic link his pet falcon . that it . but that all you need one time avenger apparently . said though , he make good action figure . one his colorful outfit winged arms make him pretty visually appealing fun pose . his sculpt all around pretty good although he some funky shoulder joints . he made bit thinner more wiry than someone like luke cage which fits his character well . there little no slop paint great articulation . he even comes accessory . he his pet falcon connect his back via clear plastic piece appear flying over his shoulder . he comes his comic , back package doubles back drop gross fat belly mojo . mojo himself mix good bad . paint sculpt his body great spot skin tones electronics coming out his head look great . his spider base , however , very plain lacks much detail you'll see pictured back package very bland featureless paint job . it also lacks any real articulation other than legs able turn right where they connect base . maybe this help it stand better , but here rub ... only four six legs actually designed touch floor due their thin spidery nature they begin bend under mojo excessive flab . i'm sure some ingenuity my part correct problem , but we really shouldn't fix new figures now should we . it mixed bag mojo .	-1
