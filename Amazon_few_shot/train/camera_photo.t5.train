professional photographer , i find myself going through 5-6 these cords each year . my equipment my livelyhood although it used often , i am exceptionally careful all my gear not bang it around or abuse it . i use stroboframe which makes it necessary use this cord raise flash well above focal plane camera . these cords very expensive get just few months out them . eventually , hot shoe connector either become loose connection no longer function or plastic connector break your flash unit fall ground . ( this happened twice me fortunately i able catch flash unit ! )the cord indespensible if you need it , but contact canon usa ask them reengineer this cord or expect replace them every few months	-1

" you get what you pay " most time cliche true , but there products out there break this rule . philips dvp642 one them , great quality , versatile product selling bargain price . this not . i hoping same this product all " glowing " reviews here . however , this quality this monopod very disappointing . first all , you ask yourself , why you need monopod over tripod ? myself most , it because we need some stability portability our telephoto zoom lenses . however , telephoto zooms long heavy so monopod should designed strong solid live up task . this monopod doesn't even come close . here it bad points : -the aluminum construction very cheap quality . leg segments wobble laterally when you extend close them . it feels like thin , cheap aluminum monopod feels it could break half like toothpick any time . -the head very cheap not solid . no matter how tight i tightened head , my camera would slope down . workmanship head so cheap any point , you think you're going break plastic tightening screw if you tighten it too much . i think we've all experienced past . -the leg locks not tight . when you push down monopod , leg segments slide back into themselves . end , it risk i took hoping i could get high-quality product cheap price . sometimes , you get away . walmart sells very decent functioning tripod only $30 . this case , i should've bought real monopod . oh well , i wasted $16 i could've used help pay higher quality monopod	-1
i just bought sony cybershot w100 camera little over month ago i only taken 30-40 pictures , i loved it then it just stopped working , so i recharged baterry , no luck still camera wouldn't turn off or . so thankfully i bought 2nd backup battery charged it tried camera again . no it doesn't work it only makes slight ding sound shuts off . basically worthless . it seems like it might short circuited . but i so excitted buy this camera i read all instructions before use , i haven't let anyone else use it it hasn't out my sight , never dropped , never extreme hot or cold , always well protected . so i am going try return it or exchange it . i am hoping get good service or i really upset spending so much money research just take 30-40 pictures . hopefully i let you know if they stand their products . before now i always happy what i bought amazo	-1

camera takes good pictures long you steady hand . some pictures come out dark some shadows pictures . some pictures come out blurry - no stabalizer . this camera randomly broke after 1 year i not drop camera ( just like reviewer ) . i bought sony pda same thing happened lcd - randomly broke - crack across lcd . course , sony said it my fault i must something it refused honor warranty pda - after 1 month ? since camera out warranty , i knew there nothing they going . so if you want decent camera lousy customer service support it - go it ! but if you want great camera great company support their products , look elsewhere . i used great financial supporter sony products - monitors , computers , camcorder , memory sticks , etc . i am not buying anymore sony products - i lost love sony their products ! beware ! canon , here i come !	-1

i this camera since jan ' 05 so far taken approximately 10,000 shots while trips weddings . don't expect much it you happy . entry level dslr it what it supposed ideal conditions . i find it strength taking people photographs bright light , provided they not moving . cons : landscape photography this camera lacking - both due inadequate megapixels it inability capture natural blues greens very well . battery dies fast . battery i got it hardly lasts whole day shooting , especially when shooting raw mode . i yet fill up 1gig card when shooting raw mode(approx 150 shots ) before battery dies . surprisingly when shooting jpegs , i get more shots per charge(over 300 ) but hardly enough last day . i cannot tell you number times battery died me while i out hike . so i always carry backup film camera ( my trusty elan 7 ) . viewfinder very dim . when i look through my elan 7 then through 300d , it painfully obvious how dark image through 300d viewfinder . indoor situations low light this becomes handicap , especially when resort manual focus . autofocus low light 300d terrible . when shooting indoors , autofocus hunts ends up focusing something behind your intended subject . i lots beautiful photos walls sconces background sharp focus while people standing front middle frame out focus blur . this despite 420ex flash my camera uses infrared beam assist focus . 420ex flash supposed " talk " camera adjust power order ensure subjects not over or under exposed . however , 300d , this crap shoot best many my indoor shots over/under exposed . after five months , shutter button started sticking . i would click it then it would remain depressed . shutter button would only pop back up after i jiggled it little . annoying thing camera settings displayed rear camera not top beside shutter button . since there only one thumbwheel , it not easy change aperature shutter speed . example , if you use thumbwheel change aperature , then change shutter speed you would press button while same time turning thumbwheel . when you take thousands shots over life camera , this real annoyance . so would i recommend this camera : if you casual point shoot person , it affordable entry into dslrs produces decent photos . but if you plan shooting lot indoors or want take landscape photographs actually convey colors accurately , look elsewhere	-1

i known canon very high quality company . however , i deeply shocked disappointed find this camera fails meet expectations i this camera . few years ago i bought fujiffilm 3800 . i loved this camera but after few ski trips i found it rather bulky . i then bought canon s500 becaus its small size after many good reviews s400 . most pictures i take ski trip this camera fine . however , if you taking pictures other than outdoors daytime , this camera worse than disposable camera . first , there no red-eye reduction . it simply not work when i set it take flash red-eye reduction . second , pictures taken dusk or dawn come out blurry . i would speculate shutter speed way too slow you would need tripod . third , night picture ?.... forget it . i tried get beatiful picture chicago skyline but picture underexposed . so , i tried manual mode played exposure settings i could not get setting would produce non-blurry pictures . looks like i'll back market fujifilm . after all reviews i've read , i'm waiting other shoe drop ( e18 , lcd , etc . ) . not mention terrible service i reading	-1
after owning three other canon cameras i am through canon . all my other cameras fine . this cameras lcd broke within first month normal use . never dropped ! all my other digital cameras held up years . ive two powershot s50s 1 lost 1 stolen . never problem those both dropped numbers times . this product defect/design flaw canon not cover it under warranty . $150.00 get it repaired it happen again , or you may start getting e18 errors . this expensive paperweight ! poor design . very dissapointed . i never buy canon product again	-1
this my third digital camera , i bought it after my tot dunked my previous camera under water . i lot research before i bought this it highly rated consumer reports . after few months ok pictures ( macro setting not very good though ) lens cover started sticking but i learned live it . i would manually open up lens cover each time . then lens cover got stuck open position i learning live . but now camera almost completely dead . it not power up properly sometimes it beeps . i'm not sure but i think i am out warranty period this . i not buy canon camera . this camera made too cheaply . i wish things not made break right away	-1
these my experiences extender mounted my eos 10d . i'm currently debating whether or not buy it my new 30d , but it looks like i don't want risk wasting my money . let me explain : let me start saying only reason i gave this 2 stars instead 1 because it prevent my nose smudging lcd screen . i shoot events nightclubs lot , so i'm always ( ) running around get shots , causing me sweat , which causes sweaty oily nose tip ( ) i always show subjects their photos after i take them , so smudgy screen kind annoying . further clarification , i'm asian , so my nose not defined or long other ethnicities . i run around lot when i shoot . so constant activity eventually led extender naturally fall off . i got lucky once , found it general vicinity where i , but second time , i wasn't so lucky . so what i ? i purchased one . not only i purchase extender , i purchase viewfinder replacement ( piece soft rubber ) because attached lost extender . 2 weeks , again , same problem . i didn't even bother buying any replacements , this time , i upgraded 30d . if you don't plan doing lot running around , then this piece may okay you . however , please take into consideration this piece also fell off me while putting my camera back my canon backpack . some reason , piece didn't fit tightly mount camera . problem , most people mentioned , images very noticeably smaller through this extender , so prepared strained eyes if you plan using your camera all day . i guess i'll check it out my local camera shop see how it fits 30d ; i'll sure write review if results different than 10d	-1

camera case only works if you wear belt -- there no clip . case itself holds only camera , not even space spare battery or memory card .

while this lens attractive price tag , this lens serious trouble sharpness . only high shutter speeds ( 1/250 above approx . ) or good flash middle apertures ( f/8 f/22 approx . ) it deliver sharp images . horribly slow autofocus . i am already saving buy l-series or usm version	-1

this camera worked very well until lens got jammed its extended position . i sent camera warranty service ( i it less than 7 months ) , they refused honor warranty because it bit scuffed little decorative ring end lens attached 2-sided tape come off . they claimed this happened due physical damage , but this occurred during normal use : i just changing modes lens didn't retract . don't bother trying get warranty service unless unit looks brand new . even then , don't surprised if they renege warranty . i a410 very same thing ( lens got jammed ) , but stolen break-in before i sent it out service ( so i suppose it no loss after all ) . obviously there design flaw causes lens extend too far come off track inside . short , this camera not suitable frequent use field . if you buy it , plan use it lot , expect buying camera or paying repair should covered under warranty ( which i'm not doing ) soon .	-1

i admit i'm far expert digital cameras . i take over 32,000 photographs 35mm cameras over 20 years . i purchased 510 powershot july 2005 . it wasn't too long before zoom cameras lens wouldn't work . i contacted canon over this you believe this company audacity charge me shipping their faulty camera back them . i understand them saying , ' we'll charge you first , but once we establish fault due us , we'll then reimburse you back . ' i enclosed type written letter camera asking canon contact me when they received my camera ( mail ) i also asked they contact me when it shipped back . ( i also emailed them same request ) . neither my wishes ever fulfilled canon behalf . itself enough me i've bitter ever since . i've also told every person i've met who wanted buy digital camera this incident . i'm pleased say , i've steered most away this company . what else i say this camera : this camera slow times after its taken picture . i've missed out some good shots due this . it eats batteries like there no tomorrow so one must rechargeable aa even make this camera worth its while . i've not used other digital cameras so maybe they all this way but if i take 3 minute movie ( this camera ) my home during day go outside , most things outside very white . almost like looking infra red photograph . when filming outside , when one goes inside during day , everything dark . like i said , maybe all digital cameras this way ? i wouldn't recommend this camera or anything canon makes if you want my personal opinion . think . you pay shipping camera that barely few months old still under warranty . that disgusting , that all i say . there should zero this , not 1 star	-1

i only wish i read previous review before i bought this item . i too trying convert my hi8 tapes digital format using pass-through my sony minidv handycam . i bought this way-too-expensive cable , mostly because it only option available . it seems ridiculous me cable should cost much low-end disk drive or graphics card , considering technology involved those devices . but my real problem failure sony reveal s-video connection useless input . this information nowhere package , nor it their website . there notice saying " please make sure this cable compatible your camcorder before you purchase " . you can't read warning when buying online , if buying store , there no way know what compatible because they don't include list compatible camcorders package . i guess they assume everyone run home check their website , then come back store buy it , instead just buying it seeing if it works . there section handycam manual describing how one might record video device using cable such this one , however they fail mention sony cable won't work , despite premium price they charge . if problem they couldn't make it work both composite s-video cable , then they should just made it work s-video , since composite cable comes camera . shame you , sony , adding little aggravation my day , shame you creating yet proprietary communications standard allows you rake us over coals when we need buy accessories supporting standard . it enough make me want buy canon camcorder ( i buy canon digital cameras precisely because i don't want submit proprietary sony standards like memorystick ) . rant over .	-1
my cannon died day before my daughters birthday so i ran out tried bunch cameras morning bought one . although this camera 6 mp , my 3.0 cannon took much clearer pictures . i this camera 9 months i am sending it second time repair . first power button stopped working , then easter ( something holidays ) all functions buttons switched . when i pushed delete , menu came up . even mode selector wasn't working . it reviewing pictures all three modes . i say sony support online very helpful , but i need something more reliable . i am this camera	-1

i working this camera year now , product shots online , while sometimes it takes great pics , many times flash pops whites out , or it goes off you get black picture . i take pictures jewelry , if i try shoot piece green blue coloration , color not accurate . purple color this camera not accurately pic up . while you fiddle 4 different picture taking settings , all different modes , you'll never get same picture twice , even saving setting . light just so , get good shot . when it shoots clearly , it take fabulous pictures , but often , pics blurred many others said , when they actually come out . my old camera , dsc p71 3.2 megapixel much better , colors accurate always , shooting flawless foolproof every time , greatest feature re-sizing your picture trimming right camera before uploading . this feature completely missing dsc p200 , which biggest disappointment , i figured it would given i didn't ask when purchasing . why would sony eliminate this great function ? i know when salesman large new york city photo store told me this camera i dreamed , i would not bought it . i prefer also use rechargable aa batteries instead lithium battery , which super hard load , charging this camera nightmare charger it comes . it like puzzle trying get charger inserted just right angle . every time it takes me several minutes , finding good little wall charger it also problem . i recently took this camera vacation take pics get footage burning dvd . sound quality good , but video quality choppy , monitor not let me even see my setting overexposed , so all my footage somewhat overexposed entire trips shootings i made . monitor , while big , not show you always what you shooting , whether still , or movie picture . overall , i would not recommend this camera i actually bought used second my old camera , got my original repaired , because this one doesn't compare . this camera bit too complicated not very user friendly . even after using all this time , i still am not sure what i am going get when i use this camera . i'd say worst features aware someone who needs accurate color , this camera clearly trouble showing blue/green shades , purples accurately , you never show these colors they life this camera , lack " trimming " resizing feature , what sony thinking ? next time , i am trying something other than sony cybershot unless i hear they gone back making great straightforward , uncomplicated easy point shoot camera . this one definitely not	-1
i bought this camera oct 2005 . i brought it everywhere . loved it . april 2006 , lcd screen blew . canon replaced it refurbished camera . march 2007 , exact same thing happened screen now they only repair $97.00 , they determined this result impact damage . how they determine this unclear me , it not dropped or impacted ... apparently , you spend 100.00 /yr maintaining this camera . , me , hallmark faulty product . unfortunate - i really loved this camera	-1
so i saw this product got 5 stars , so i ordered it ...... when i got it , its like " um ... it ??? " it really cute , really well made , but it no where hold my usb cord or memory cards ... also , there no hp embroidered front like picture it , also , strap i got really cracked not look good all ... other than , it cute , but not best out there .	-1
i purchased this camera right before we our first child . needless say , i would rather donated money charity ! flash recovery time ridiculously slow , but i live . 4 out every 5 pictures come out blurry , i not . now i photo album blurry baby pictures we reflect . needless say i think we try different brand when we purchase our next camera	-1
i bought this camera year ago , camera goog only outdoor use lot light , but using indoor ( flash ) very , very bad . when you use flash photo not good , but if you go beach this may regular choice , if you bought camera .	-1
i say i am very disappointed this camera . i really high hopes this one . i waited hd2 come out when i saw lot positive reviews i bought one , i should waited . sanyo call this hd camera doesn't make sense . picture more grain noise then my old high 8 camera . outdoors bright light camera ok . low-light horrible pros : - nice form factor , love look feel it so tiny it fits your pocket . very portable something you take anywhere . - secure digital cards great , transfer edit computer quickly- still pictures pretty good . although still digital cameras better . - hdmi output plug directly into your hdtv ( although if you used watching things hd you disappointed)cons : - indoor low light situations very grainy , even high sensitivity button . - don't attempt take still shots while you filming , it works but when you watch film you hear loud noises shot pauses 2 or 3 seconds then continues . very cheesy . - you hear data written secured digital card video which annoying . i thought sd supposed minimize noise . - watching playback movement this makes me dizzy , not even fast movement either . - image stabilization not great either compared other cameras i used . - audio sounds bit tinny my opinion this camera geared portability able capture moments quickly this something you always carry you . if you aren't too concerned quality picture it probably fine . i really think sanyo great concept one day this could end all all device . now it should come warning it limitations . i am not saying it total garbage , but if you high hopes like i , you disappointed .	-1
i purchased this sony dcrhc21 . this carry case listed accesory so i expected it appropriately sized ( other sony cases i've purchased fit like glove ) . this case entirely too large hold minidv camcorder . camcorder rattles around inside it . if you extra attachments lenses maybe you might need this one . otherwise i suggest you look product specifications , note dimensions then look your camcorder size .	-1

bought this xmas present myself - bring family photos while business travel . i'm now 2nd unit ( exchanged directly w/phillips ) , am still same issue it not reliably working external ( my case , sony memory sticks ) . internal memory pitiful , unless you want resize all photos you put it , you not going able hold very many internally . i've yet get auto on/off feature work , while it perhaps pc friendly device , it certainly not always mac friendly - controls cumbersome work , directions meager . i wanted able carry this backpack or carryon bag , fact support stand can't folded tight against unit makes it difficult this - course , no mention this product description . also no mention it only supports older memory sticks - no support new , ms produo sticks ( no mention product descriptions either)i thought i would get quality product phillips , this certainly looked like it potential - unfortunately , it turned out piece junk , one i've screwing around so long it probably not returnable . don't waste your time dollars .......................	-1

panasonic very compact , very stylish sexy my wife called it , but photos very disappointing : they way noisy ! even if set lowest asa setting 80asa it just barely acceptable they get progressively worse anything above 100asa . colours good , it take very good videos , but still photos just plain bad when compared other cameras photoshop cs2 . course it easy understand why : native resolution images . if one investigates such things , notice panasonic only 72 dpi , same sony , canon improves this 180 , nikon 300 dpi . it not just megapixels folks , but how those megapixels recorded what resolution . obviously camera 72 dpi more noise than one 180 or 300 dpi . so before you buy any digital camera or thinking upgrading newer model , yourself favour . try 4 or 5 cameras same megapixel range good camera store taking photos same subject same light condition . set camera lowest asa highest picture quality jpg format , take photos , pop sd card into computer , compare images photoshop . enlarge full pixel size ( 100%) , look meta data same time you see yourself . what i , since i not very happy images my panasonic produced ! i this camera 11 months 20 days exactly , today i traded it nikon p5000 after evaluating over dozen models including leica d-lux3 10mp camera , driving sales persons crazy all testing spending 4 hours store , but it very educational them too	-1

my primary use this camera take pictures indoors very bright lighting , without use flash . camera couldn't handle taking pictures without flash all , despite it extremely bright room ( 5 different lights plus 3 overhead halogen track lights ) . camera shutter speed so slow it nearly impossible get picture wasn't blurry . maybe 1 every 4 pictures came out clear . i believe fact its 10 megapixel camera what it . i used cannon powershot sd450 awesome , but it stolen so i needed replacement . i no complaints 450 it took same type pictures bright indoor lighting just fine without flash , unlike 900 . i am sure camera would fine people who always use flash or take their pictures bright sunlight but my purpose , this camera horrible it since returned . instead , i just got fuji finepix f30 , which supposed better without flash . we'll see	-1

i start off saying , i loved my sony cybershot . when alpha came out i couldn't wait get one . it died after 200 pictures day three three week once life time trip through south america . amazon said it out their hands because it must returned within 30 days . i've spent 3 hours so far dealing sony . most people i spoke or on-line live chat support unfamiliar product transferred me around business support , computers , video . they also contradicted one . when i get someone who knew product i told firmly despite camera lemon malfunctioning after only taking 200 pictures they would only ' repair it ' not replace it . now i am stuck lemon , i fear i history further disappointment frustration this camera . i highly recommend you read all customer reviews . other people problems camera , i ignored them because i faith sony thought other alpha owners ' dud cameras unusual . if you decide purchase anyway , i highly recommend you not buy through amazon , but through real store good fair return policy , stands behine their products . places like microcenter exhange , no questions ask . i am kicking myself because amazon $100 cheaper then microcenter . penny wise pound foolish . i love amazon , but , i never buy anything other than books dvds them . lesson learned electronics .	-1

it unfortunate name like canon , you expect quality camera . that why you shell out money item you think canon stand behind . unfortunately , this not case . i bought this camera use graduate school ( industrial design ) . i needed it research my thesis . i figured , all product photographs , need good portfolio pieces , spending 500.00 8mp camera would well worth investment . i wrong . month after i bought camera , it started malfunction . lens got stuck would not come out . neither would it go all way back , so lens cover would not close ( not only putting lens danger , but draining battery well . ) it still under warranty , so i sent it canon service center elk grove village , illinois . it received , i informed my camera would returned 7-10 business days . almost month half ago . i put my thesis research hold because i not proper camera it . every time i call service center , i am told " parts back order " . evidently they don't know when these shipments due their center , so they don't know when i my camera back . best part , when i called two weeks ago , they offered me " brand new " s215 . told me it great deal i should accept offer because " they never " ( meaning they never offer new camera one repair . ) i pointed out s215 only 5mp , smaller screen , cost nearly 300.00 less than my camera . i also reminded her my camera brand new when it broke i send it . today i told there no information my camera , backordered parts , or when they could send my camera back . woman phone asked me why i didn't accept s215 offered , when i explained asked camera same model mine , she said they not authorized . i told her i going spend time originally set aside my thesis research write letters both service center canon corporate headquarters , she suddenly technician she could consult , my camera would back me end week . i won't hold my breath , but copy this review sent canon .	-1

hi , i bought this camera installed driver both cd then web . it caused my computer ( good , modern , fast computer ) crash both times . camera worked without interfacing computer , but , then , what point ? also , pictures movies very grainy low quality . tech support when i these problems horrible . they really didn't stand behind product all me that most important thing ! maybe i could gotten it work , but not without some input aiptek . i've never written one these reviews before , but this really got me . don't buy this camera my advice .	-1
this camera took some great pictures , i enjoyed it size functionality several months . i sitting lawn chair barbecue last weekend when i passing it friend who also seated . camera fell 2 feet onto soft grass . end . lens assembly shot , according my local camera store , not economical fix . this softest fall camera could take , not work , it like landing pillow . i not buy hp cameras again	-1
i've purchased seven items amazon 2005 , so i'm not complete rookie . this item ad title includes word " battery " big , bold letters . i purchased this kit advertised " used price " , but " condition : new " . ad picture clearly shows battery . i looked several ads not read individual seller comment " battery missing " uppercase , though regular font . me , missing part warrants more warning than " comment " . that my " lesson learned " , but i still find it confusing advertise both complete incomplete kits together under identical ad titles without prominently displayed warning big , bold text indicating most valuable part missing . lesson learned : read whole ad specific seller , especially " seller comments "	-1
this camera looks cool . but it so , so not cool . people responsible this device should ashamed themselves . this far one worst products i ever purchased . ever . second day lens cap no longer stayed place . it " clips " ... but not long . camera internal memory rubbish camera totally destroyed my memory card somehow . it complelety unreadable . even 150mb card i could only take few short quality videos . you shoot more video if you use low quality settings . i'm talkin ' low quality . worse than any video you've seen online . more problems include battery cover falling off without hardly even touching it . controls interface not intuitive . you'll probably end up accidentally deleting files you meant keep . oh , earbuds come camera/mp3 player/hunk-o-junk huuuuge . they aren't comfortable least cord too short . i camera my pocket when i stood erect , earphones violently yanked my ears . they're obviously intended oompa-loompas . i'm sure i could found more problems this thing , but it eventually died me no reason . don't waste your time this . you sorely disappointed . fact , if i could give this product rating of-10 stars i would so . i'm so extremely disappointed this camera	-1
they made several changes - some good , most bad - since i bought my last sony handicam 8/2003 . first all , there no carrying strap . this very inconvenient if you plan use your hand anything else except holding your camera . i managed jury rig one but it royal pain . docking station just one more thing carry when you want upload your mini cassettes your computer , you take camera off docking station change cassettes . this messes up my editing program . fortunately i still my old camera . ability take still shots better - more megapixels - but not good enough zoom or enlarge . while i told most people prefer use led screen ( i don't knoiw why it eats up more power you can't see clearly bright sun ) i like use viewfinder . it no longer tilt up feature so i end up mashing battery into my cheek . this last complaint batteries . sony lied amount time battery hold . 5 hour battery only charges 194 minutes my camera . that slightly more than 3 hours ; it nowhere near 5 hours . 7 hour battery not get anywhere near 7 hours either . their packages should accurate . all all , it not good older product . there also should setting stop it running if rec . button not pushed . this my last sony unless they make major improvements	-1
i owned several digital cameras , this my current digital camera hands . i would write short review critical person concentration only important things watch . pros- uses only 2 aa batteries . - battery life very good . - small camera size . easily fits into pocket . - set ' +' flash level , which forces camera make stronger flash . i use it almost every time . cons- resolution . images not sharp terms you can't distinguish individual pixels when looking real size picture . i would say , there no much difference quality 4 mp 50% ( 1 mp ) scaled down version . same problem exists sony dsc w1 camera . - i many problems " " button . sometimes camera refuses turn . it fixed shaking camera trying again . ( it could defect my camera only ) . - some camera parts painted plastic , which scratched . - camera lose all settings preferences if left discharged batteries ( ~ several hours ) or without them all ( 10 minutes ) . - video quality 640x480 pretty good high quality mode , but eats flash space very quickly . windows 2000 didn't right codec view file . i install it myself . - camera performing slightly below average low lighting condition auto settings	-1
thing it not very stable camera , hence it not give you very stable shots , so many your pics blured . even those taken tripod . i am pro photographer , i would not recommend this camera . yes , it very thin , but not worth pics it takes ... seek other model not so tiny if you're expecting better images	-1
please buy different camera . i owned 5 different pocket digital cameras . under normal wear tear , cannon sd400 lcd screen broke where other cameras i've owned not . i just purchased nikon s7c bigger screen so well protected i hit it no adverse affect . if you buy sd400 , set aside $150 you'll likely need replace lcd	-1
i bought this almost exactly 2 years ago , i turned it other day went take picture indoors required flash , flash would not work . it set automatic flash . using auto setting , i thought there used 3 flash settings ( auto , forced flash no flash ) , but now there only 2 . i took it outside sunny day used auto flash , flash went off outside ! something messed up it light dark confused . thinking i hit something changed setting , i reset it factory defaults it still doesn't work . it probably too expensive get it fixed , it weird but i just upgraded nikon d50 . i must known this camera die . even when it worked , half time pictures came out blurry . i either got fantastic crystal clear shots or blurry ones if auto focus missed . maybe camera defective entire time i it . no more canons me	-1
i bought my canon a95 november 2004 . little after 1 year just after manufacturer warranty expired , infamous e18 error struck . i called factory repair center get repair estimate , they quoted $89 plus $8 shipping handling . i bought camera $300 online , now it going cost me roughly 1/3 its purchase cost repair it . all i know , it might break down again after repair ! repair comes 90-day warranty period , but it could break again after 90 days . then ... there upgrade option . canon offers program where you upgrade a95 a610 $125 plus $10 shipping handling . this comes only 6-month warranty . again , it could flawed same e18 error could struck after warranty expires . i would really extensive research before buying canon .	-1

this camera takes blurry pictures straight out box . one mistake i made not take my own sd card camera shop look output . i thought blurry image i seeing camera store because low resolution screen but it really camera . i've missed too many pictures my kids am process buying new camera short 2 months after buying this . casio support responsive tried help but nothing appears work . point shoot definately not option . i thought it would nice take quick pictures kids but none them worth keeping . i've taken over 200 pictures i not print any them .	-1

i bought this retailer " black friday " half what amazon selling it i'm still bringing it back . i think it horrible . i so excited get mini-dv camcorder because i heard how great picture , but this takes horrible video . it comes out so dark you hardly see anything , even using light . even fairly well-lit room it came out dark . it looked ok lcd screen , but when i hooked it up tv , horrible ! it not my tv either because i hooked up my old camcorder it looked fine . i love it so small , but if i can't see video , it no use me . back big old sony	-1

i'm not good photographer but use my cameras vacation/backpacking pictures . p3 fourth point shoot nikon camera my family owned . one previous cameras lens quit woking probably because it got some dirt it . p3 lens extends out pretty far when camera turned . i accidently dropped it 30 " off ground when it only few days old . it landed back but flipped over lens . outer ring lens ended up crooked would not retract or focus . i sent it back nikon i expected they said repair would not covered warranty . they charged $162.50 fix it . mastercard program called " purchase assurance " hopefully cover repair cost ! other night i saw commercial tv olympus camera could dropped 5 feet , get wet , or even frozen down 14 degrees still take pictures . i wish i seen ad first . nikon takes great pictures but way too fragile small point shoot camera . not buying nikon anymore .	-1
here short version . oct05 i bought fujifilm finepix f460 digital camera $299.99 . nov06 camera stopped working correctly - snapshots alternating bright/dark horizonal strips across them . jan07 i sent camera fujifilm service center repair stating camera always handled care ~ $300 camera should work more than just 1 month after its warranty expires . jan07 service center sent me repair estimate $70.00 + tax shipping totaling $85.95 ( i spent $16.52 send it them so my total expense would $102.47 repair if i accepted ) . feb07 i contacted service center stated i think they should stand behind their product fix camera once they verify malfunction not caused user abuse . i don't think it makes sense me pay $100 repair $300 camera stopped working only 1 month after warranty expired . service rep , named christina , asked me fax her copy original reciept she would see what she could . i complied . mar07 fujifilm returned camera me unrepaired note saying i not reply estimate . now i now send them camera its memory card printout this review asking them refund cost camera , its memory card , shipping i paid .	-1

-- update 4/23/2007 - vendor indicates new firmware release due 5/2007 - 6/2007 time frame , it may fix issue limited number pictures mentioned below . -- picture quality fair adjusting brightness contrast setup yields good results . appearance unit good black cherry frames nicely finished , but red rectangular sensor remote below lcd display mars effect somewhat . 5.6 inches , this size frame only useful where it viewed up close . images smaller than 4x6 print you would typically view book or hold your hand . i found putting it book shelf too far away . end table next chair you would view it better . size lcd also should tell you resolution not spectacular , true any frame this category . my biggest problem this particular unit even after updating latest firmware ( ~ 3/2007 ) , it only display up 250 pictures . i expected what ever memory card i inserted would displayed . overall this still good buy if you not want display large number photos . i am very disappointed number displayable pictures not listed manufacturer product description so you know limit before you purchase it	-1
i bought this camera just under 12 months ago recently battery cover door would not stay closed . i sent it into nikon my proof purchase week later got letter saying it would not covered under warranty . repair charge shipping tax would $115.22 . i am only person uses this camera it never dropped or abused . battery only taken out maybe 4 or 6 times over time i it . this reason i would never buy nikon product again . next digital camera charge without removing battery . camera takes great pictures , but can't business firm very difficult get ahold not honor their warranty . bye bye nikon	-1
i won this camera contest now i'm kinda wishing i never . practically everything i've shot this thing turned out bad some way or . autofocus never decide what it wants focus , very poor image quality slightly low lighting situations , camera recording glitches audio when i capture onto my computer . i know you may look this thing feel like price right , but i really suggest you just hold out little while longer save up bit more buy canon camera that not gonna cause you these problems	-1
even though amazon specifically recommended this bag panasonic lumix ( dmc-fz20pp ) camera , even though i return it because it too small , even though my camera not appear compatibility list shown customer review , amazon annoyingly continues recommend this bag my camera . add insult injury , amazon tried deduct shipping my refund claiming error not their fault .

manufacturer apparently states this case compatible panasonic fz1 ( extension fz3 which identical body ) . i bought it report it not compatible fz1 . just lens cap you jam it into bag sideways then wrestle camera get it back out . if you prefer use camera lens hood adapter camera can't fit bag all . there also no padding speak this case . comparison my lowe case my canon eos elan provides secure , padded repository you put camera lens down strap top so camera easily withdrawn again . targus makes decent laptop cases , but they great deal learn camera cases apparently . apparently it fit some cameras , just not panasonic fzs . considering product made china one should able expect bit more this price	-1
power cord accompanies this charger bulkier than charger itself . you wouldn't get picture . too bad , other manufacturers learned incorpaorate plugging mechanism directly into charger .	-1
terrible product . printer jams repeatedly or paper never feeds properly . i've replacement sent same thing happens . even though i printed less than 50 photos this replacement , which i less than year , kodak support says it cannot fixed me i need it serviced them 80 bucks . new one sells $99 price dropping fast . i told kodak support i would not send it back them , spending 80 dollars would like flushing money down toilet or taking stick eye . i further notified kodak i would instead send it place it belongs - land fill . also , i've heard recommended fix ( which not work , way ) , unplugging unit reset , cause color cartridge light illuminate prematurely . cost paper cartridges , this last insult makes this printer one avoid . 1 star because when it print prints look good , but , man , aggravation get this thing work correctly not worth any price . rushed market place without enough reliability testing unsuspecting public . total junk venerable name desperate hit product .	-1

i bought this camera myself during christmas 2004 . it suppose utility camera , ebay items class projects kids only -- i don't trust digital cameras family photos . kodak cx7300 seemed fit bill ; inexpensive , easy use more than enough resolution 3.2 mp . flaw this camera didn't appear until i pulled it out drawer some months later . camera wouldn't turn . i checked batteries they excellent shape . i eventually tried replacing batteries , sure enough , worked . next time i took out camera , exact same thing happened . time after . first , i thought cx7300 eating batteries . but eventually i came conclusion camera doesn't eat batteries , it nibbles them . it won't run anything but brand-spanking-new batteries . kodak batteries came cx7300 still my mini-mag flashlight , going strong . i contacted kodak this flaw . they wanted talk what kind batteries i'm using -- kodak -- or option my purchasing camera dock some rechargeable batteries . solution would increase my investment seventy-five percent . i thought buying optional ac adapter would simple , cheap , solution . surprise , surprise , cx7300 one few digital cameras kodak makes doesn't take one . so , now i'm way past warranty , what i it ? i'm shopping camera	-1

( i haven't time try it though ! ) celestron offered no refunds this telescope , so buyer beware . if they not willing satisfy customers , your business better served company who stand behind product it sells . good luck	-1

i guess i really shouldn't complain because my husband won camera office rally . but pictures it takes disgraceful samsung product every two three pictures blurred unrecognizably-where you can't even tell what you taken . if you found yourself among fortunate few who actually found success this camera thank your lucky stars . even if it less expensive choice versus other cameras market today spend extra money it would worth it not miss any family moments like my family , this useless piece crap	-1
i own olympus fe-100 digital camera , it came unchargeable batteries ( oxyride ) . i switched energizer batteries bought energizer 4-battery charger less than price half tank gas . it not quick charger like this one , but i say less than half investment , i've got charger job . i would not spend this kind money charger . so i say , if you're part " gotta it now " generation , you definitely pay convenience . otherwise , charge your batteries more slowly ( 2-3 hours ) save lot money	-1
i read other review , decided give it try . soon i recieve it mail , opened box , i realized this mistake . cheap quality binocular " high power " selling point . it came already broken two eye ruber pieces falling apart . you see how cheap glue used put it place ! it extremly heavy hold hands more than one minute nature observation . you constantly ajdusting focus . your fingers bumps focus bar while you holding it . indeed strap , case , lense protectors all cheap crap , annoying it all ~ ! i am taking this back , buying made japan " nikon eagle view " 100 times better . you get what you pay ~ !!!!!	-1

recently built digital picture frame scratch , i excited when someone gave us this frame xmas , see what commercial frame would like . after using it few weeks , i say if it wasn't present i would return it get one built people who some sense innovation . good : * screen bright , images look great * resolution only 640x480 but it play images up 10 megapixel they look pretty good me . doesn't seem like you need much higher resolution than such small screen . * computer connection worked great - i plugged it into my xp box , all drivers installed automatically without need cd then 4 new removable drives showed up . it would nice if only drives card them showed up but this minor issue . bad : my main complaint this picture frame people who made it obviously no interest making sort product you enjoy using because it clear inventor appreciated why such product would fun or what makes it improvement over what there before . if i bought this frame 1999 or if it cost $50 , i could forgiven it poor design , but 2007 , $180 , it completely unacceptable . we live future here people , get program ! i not used other frames market , but given you buy old tablet pc 12 " screen ebay $70 , strap it into cheap frame make your own , pc-based screen works 100 times better than this frame , just running screen saver under $150 , i'd say this frame not worth money all . this screen just doesn't deliver goods price . some details : * menu system insanely poorly designed - instance , you specific menu adjust system settings - pushing " setup " button any other time nothing despite fact setting global * remote control only works when you standing foot computer pointing it directly tiny ir hole front screen . * screen only works horizontal frame - there no way set it up vertical frame ( i.e. 480x640 frame ) because frame automatically rotates vertical images there no way turn this " feature " off . * slowest slideshow speed setting 1 minute images . your only other option it just 1 image doesn't change . * no way connect remotely computer or easily get images onto frame without take frame where your computer or go through tedious process memory card crappy menu system . * good viewings angles limited but this general problem lcd screens	-1

this worst camera i've ever owned . i'm not exaggerating . i'm so upset wasting money it . only pictures turn out , outside bright daylight . it takes horrible pictures low light , there high level noise photos . video mode moves out its own , ruining video . i sometimes get colored lines down right side videos . my friend $88 dollar digital camera takes way better pictures than this thing . it just plain sucks .	-1
me-1 provides modest 1.2 magnification viewfinders olympus e-300 e-500 cameras . ideally , this would allow sharper manual focusing more precise framing . unfortunately , this not happen when i used me-1 make number trial images my e-500 , so i returning me-1 refund . ( record , i wear prescription eyeglasses while shooting , my " shooting eye " corrected 20/20 vision . ) like other folks , i find e-500 viewfinder trifle small so it not always easy frame shot see exposure data same time . camera must also pressed against your face when framing , which not always comfortable . some ways , me-1 created more problems than it solved . me-1 kept camera further my face ( though it seemed bump harder against my glasses ) , but cost * narrowing * my angle vision viewfinder . divide viewfinder into four equal columns rows so you eight squares . four squares middle viewfinder easily visible , but those sides , top , bottom * less * visible than before , corners considerably less . frame shot , i move my eye around viewfinder much more me-1 than without it . see exposure data , i shift my eye almost completely away image . more hassle than i need when shooting field . fortunately , there option works me . e-300 e-500 come ep-5 eyecup , which definitely too small my taste . but larger eyecup also available , ep-6 . ep-6 keeps camera little further my face . viewfinder diopter properly adjusted ( critical step no one seems mention ) , ep-6 allows me see both entire image exposure data without shifting my eye very much all . all this vary person person , course , there may circumstances when me-1 exactly what needed -- so two rather than one star . but not standard shooting conditions , especially if you need compose , set exposure , shoot quickly	-1

this first digital camera i owned . overall i am generally satisfied quality pictures it produces . however , there few things , if i known beforehand , would prevented me purchasing this camera . 1 ) camera not plug-and-play ( even if they say it ) . you install kodak easyshare software download pictures . this huge negative . future , i only buy cameras show up removable storage drives when plugged into computer . 2 ) video stored apple quicktime format (* . mov ) . also huge negative . codecs this format not widely available application integration . you download use apple quicktime view them . you not view videos windows media player . it also not compatible some photo-album software . i would only buy cameras future option store video non-proprietary format . update : after review , i found winxp vista plug-n-play camera when it plugged into usb port . it not work win2k . thanks comment made me double-check	-1

this 7th olympus camera i've owned over years , film digital . i always very pleased olympus cameras their usual superior optics . this camera , though , major disappointment , mainly because even though it shoot raw , there no compatible conversion available yet , leaving you unable process raw images . this renders camera worthless this time serious pictures you no choice but shoot jpeg . olympus should ensured vendors such adobe necessary information make compatible raw conversion plug-ins available before this camera hit market . there no excuse olympus not made sure this case , indeed it downright irresponsible . said above , camera lens quite nice , camera itself operates well . you take quite good pictures . however , camera not suitable flash pictures medium low-light situations there significant lag time time you press shutter picture actually taken ---- if you're taking pictures people , they moved time picture taken . battery life very good . camera fits nicely your palm . , 28 - 500 mm lens great . if you don't shoot raw you don't depend flash photography , camera worth look . otherwise , look other products this time	-1

i've just returned this unit . it doesn't play videos advertised . i able get it properly play . avi files 320 240 resolution ... see other review below . but 320x240 gives postage stamp size picture . 640 480 playback full size but jerky broken .... more later . i now 3 different brands 8 " photo frames my possession : phillips , pandigital , this coby . i developed following list features my " ideal " photo frame . first , video playback : i've taking lot video clips my digital still camera ... they come out well convenience not lug my camcorder , ability quickly transfer clip files within/between chips my computer attractive . i would like frame which play format my camera taking ( . mov , more later ) i'd also like frame play multi-media show ... , play movie clips show presentations , intermixed . jpg photo files . second feature play . wma music files , addition mp3 . this because i non-ipod personal music player . all my music . wma format because it roughly half file size mp3 . third , i would like timer my frame ... set it come morning , off night , example . fourth , i'd like audio or speaker out feature . none these frames home theater-like sound , i extra pair computer speakers i'd probably hook up . video out could come handy too . fifth , i'd like able rotate stills within frame software , manually or automatically . yes , you rotate them computer , but frame may or may not preserve rotation . ( this may depend which photo edit program you using . ) sixth , i'd like folder hierarchy file management system frame software . especially huge chips now available , i see advantage push couple buttons change picture set ( folder ) , rather than switching out chips . here where 3 units i've stack up , followed my next ( fourth ) unit . i am keeping pandigital .... which costco $140 . it plays . mov video files , but not within slideshow . it no speaker out jack sound tinny . it requires mp3 music files . it permits picture rotation . no folder management system . no clock/timer . no ability play stills/video intermixed . i think coby phillips picture quality brighter but pandigital ok . phillips didn't play video , since it also software glitch when i returned it i decided look elsewhere . ( no remote no music philips either . ) coby won't play my videos , even after i used my converter program try 10 different mp4 avi variations . coby plays . wma music files , won't rotate stills , no folder system , no clock/timer . it speaker out jack . it not permit intermixing video stills one multimedia show . picture quality fully equal philips , generally recognized standard . if all you want photos , never turn your camera sideways , this unit good value . unit i'd like get play would image moments model digitalfoci . i've exchanged emails someone there who clearly knows what they talking i believe this unit intermix my photos videos .	-1

i searching line elsewhere good camcorder 1 ) replacement my jvc gr-d70u , which died , 2 ) go online video blog . after much study evaluation , i chose canon zr800 based salesman recommendation , frustration number choices which available , presence external microphone jack ( which one my " must-have " options ) . after returning home , i read review miamian " new reviewer " , felt trepidation . after charging battery , i tried camera . lo behold , miamian right . there obvious noise when recording , which not present my jvc . hoping against hope , i played tape back , , just i feared , tape pronounced hiss . this not just tape hiss , but much more pronounced noise , which transfers tv when watching . it rendered camcorder totally unacceptable . i took camcorder back , , like miamian , ordered sony dch-hc38 . ( i know , it doesn't external microphone jack , but after all this confusion , i give up !! why don't they make more cameras them ?? )the plus signs this camera its menu much more intuitively laid out , selection desired item not even require looking instruction book . joystick selector so easy use , select play , rewind , fast forward , stop , pause playback mode , also used select various menu items other modes . wide screen viewfinder ( lcd ) so nice use , easy see , all others ( 4:3 ) become passe ' . i didn't any chance evaluate other aspects camera , due unacceptable noise which demanded rejection unit . picture looked ok ; it not greatly impress me , however , automatic focus appeared slow very noticeable playback . essence , caveat emptor ; especially if you're hard hearing . others watching listening tape not	-1

well . i convinced fx07 bad product after using it 6 months . like lot other reviews pointed out , noise level low-light condition annoying , give you watercolor-like effect . some pictures i took during visit monterey bay aquarium turned out completely dark ( prevent this beforehand , i even took photos same objects using several different settings , only get results bad , worse , worst ) . picture quality nowhere close my old old old sony cybershot t7 . i totally disappointed . if not my t7 broken , i wouldn't even wanna use this camera . even re-sell it other people , i would feel it like crime . after revisiting this webpage read more user reviews , i realized i must got defective item amazon . well . what i say ? it 6 months . bottom line : just careful when you received this item . some test shots . if anything looks suspicious , ask replacement . after all , all high praise here can't all wrong	-1

if you looking take high quality pictures , then look elsewhere . it nice taking quick snapshots family or what-have-you , but not much else . ( or beginner photography or child . ) you hold very still if you don't want your pictures come out blurry . also , flash makes images far too bright if you don't use flash it sometimes makes images come out far too dark . only thing i like this camera it size . it great just keep your pocket or your bag ... anyway , i'm buying better one soon	-1

i ordered this mic after return ecmhs1 ( because it , reality , totally non-directional ) . well , this one actually directional , but it such pain use i wish i never bought it . 1st all , you should know this mic not work " smart shoe " available most sony camcorders - this means it not receive any power or transfer sound data camcorder through shoe . therefore it battery powered . this may seem like minor problem , but it means you need remember turn it off each time you video , otherwise you either soundless video or dead battery . believe me , some point you forget this . not smart shoe compatible also means you plug mic into jack camcorder - this real hassle if you small device trying loop cord around so it isn't way . ( my case jack under rather cheap plastic cover threatens break off repeated use . )( you might expect , i highly recommend you check whether mic smart shoe compatible . course , means mic doesn't need battery or audio plug - not it simply fit into shoe . it great feature . ) finally , while engineers sony some amazing things over years , they weren't able even half-decent job designing cap covers this mic battery . this cap fall off even slightest touch . this incredibly annoying . mine fell off several times - fortunately i always managed find it . i finally put piece duct tape secure it ( doesn't look great , but least color matches ) . considering high cost , this mic really bad investment . while non-directional mics most camcorders pretty pathetic , this very poor substitute .	-1
my husband bought me this camera my birthday may 2006 . i loved this camera . well , it stopped working christmas eve . i used it morning no problems , put it charger recharge later evening . when i removed camera evening , screen remained black . it would not take any pictures . after talking customer service folks , i sent my camera repair . it under warranty , i not anything break camera . well , they voided my warranty stating it " impact damage " my repair bill $111.00 . you got kidding . i called question voided warranty since i not dropped camera . technician i spoke explained " impact damage " could happen if camera bumped up something your purse . so i asked speak manager . i am sorry , but if i am going spend this much money camera , i expect little better quality . i called email kodak company several times someone talk me . nobody bothered return either my calls or emails . i would seriously think twice before spending money camera break no fault your own only warranty voided billed amount comparable brand new camera . i discovered quality product only good company stand behind it .	-1

i bought this camera after reading reviews wanted get camera uses different media type other than smartmedia ( which only lasts month ) . i would say i am extremely disappointed , particularly grainy images completely out focus edges . even all settings highest possible quality powershot sd1000 , my old olympus camedia c-2020 takes much better photos . it incredible how blurry edges surprised why no one mentioned it so obvious , especially other reviewer pro photographer . so blurry i use photoshop crop out left right sides . right side worse than left making 1/8th entire image unrecognizable . maybe i simply got one bad lens . any case , no thanks , i'll stick my trusty old camera . i would rather pay new smartmedia card each month .	-1

panasonic very compact , very stylish sexy my wife called it , but photos very disappointing : they way noisy ! even if set lowest asa setting 80asa it just barely acceptable they get progressively worse anything above 100asa . colours good , it take very good videos , but still photos just plain bad when compared other cameras photoshop cs2 . course it easy understand why : native resolution images . if one investigates such things , notice panasonic only 72 dpi , same sony , canon improves this 180 , nikon 300 dpi . it not just megapixels folks , but how those megapixels recorded what resolution . obviously camera 72 dpi more noise than one 180 or 300 dpi . so before you buy any digital camera or thinking upgrading newer model , yourself favour . try 4 or 5 cameras same megapixel range good camera store taking photos same subject same light condition . set camera lowest asa highest picture quality jpg format , take photos , pop sd card into computer , compare images photoshop . enlarge full pixel size ( 100%) , look meta data same time you see yourself . what i , since i not very happy images my panasonic produced ! i this camera 11 months 20 days exactly , today i traded it nikon p5000 after evaluating over dozen models including leica d-lux3 10mp camera , driving sales persons crazy all testing spending 4 hours store , but it very educational them too	-1

i this camera year . it nothing but problem . first , kodak easyshare software continuous problems . i spent hours trying fix it . still bugs it no matter what i . secondly , camera very unreliable . i wedding go this weekend i not trust it am taking disposable camera too . how i explain problems i ? there so many . camera misfunctions continuously . sometimes it nothing all . other times zoom lense not shut . you turn option selector even though it option you select you get option . i sometimes not even shut camera off i gotta take batteries out so ... if i even find batteries work camera . honestly , i call tech supoport told them problems i they tell me only kodak batteries work camera told me buy some . so i went nice camera shop they not sell kodak batteries . camera salesman told me kodak cameras junk brand battery should not matter . i believe him . so my camera which would not work ... i asked salesman help me out . it not work any lithium batteries ..... reusable or rechargable . he popped some alkaline batteries amazingly it worked . well , everyone knows alkaline batteries real short short life . my camera now not work either batteries . probably only kodak batteries .... maybe .... or maybe kodak wants get ten bucks out me . i personally don't even think pictures this camera takes any good . really , when people take pictures me this camera my eyes always closed . i am so anxious get rid this camera ..... well would but know i gotta fork over least $250 good camera . trying save money this ' disposable ' camera waste . stay away kodak cameras ! if you don't believe me get creditable camera magazine read reviews .	-1
i'm giving this 2 stars only because my daughter also this camera onher wish list . if not i would upset recieved wrong camerathat i ordered .........	-1
rated one star lack value . you buy same canon brand case under $14 higher capacity , imho better , albeit non name brand , 1200mah battery under $10 amazon . neck strap not worth difference .	-1
i one panasonic doesn't driver or processing downloads it or even respond requests . proprietary video format requires special handling your pc leave you camera full useless clips . they abandoning this product ? look panasonic website see yourself	-1
this good charger - quick portable . but battery life battery sucks !	-1
it sounds like good system if it worked . you cannot use this system or indoor camera if you or your neighbors within 300 feet : wireless computer network , or cordless phone ( 2.4 ghz ) , or microwave running . i'm not kidding - i can't believe this even passed testing . i think mobicam newer system you should investigate owning . those lots reviews . pay attention them	-1
decent camera , but not great . shark mode nice . housing looks good , but mine leaked ~ 20 ft ... camera dead time i got it out water . good news amazon processed defective product return rapidly credited my account week . net result one decent picture disappointing christmas present . next time i buy housing better camera . canon some nice ones	-1
i read other review , decided give it try . soon i recieve it mail , opened box , i realized this mistake . cheap quality binocular " high power " selling point . it came already broken two eye ruber pieces falling apart . you see how cheap glue used put it place ! it extremly heavy hold hands more than one minute nature observation . you constantly ajdusting focus . your fingers bumps focus bar while you holding it . indeed strap , case , lense protectors all cheap crap , annoying it all ~ ! i am taking this back , buying made japan " nikon eagle view " 100 times better . you get what you pay ~ !!!!!	-1
bag ok but you must careful if your moving around lot . extra batteries top zip compartment it really top heavy tips upside down while your shoulder if camera out it . velcro not hold it closed well either . my memory card fell out bag during one these episodes , thank goodness my husband noticed	-1
this best item i ever bought my camera . i lot walking my camera , thought i would use it walking stick , which i , but best part this monopod what i never thought would happen . my pictures never fuzzy ! i take low light photos they come out clear . i paid very little this item would never caught without it my camera . three levers bottom allow quick expansion all different lengths . carrying case allows this item packed next my camera without it getting scratched	1
i believe this one best lens $1000 . forget zoom lenses even if they . this lens far better than 70-200l my opinion . it very sharp f2 even more sharp 2.5 . zoom lenses you set f/ 5.6 better result f/8 match this lens . it very well built but not excessive heavy , come hood bag , but unfortunately , canon decided remove hard cases all lenses . combined tamron 1.4 teleconverter this lens provide very good optical quality par any zoom lenses 189mm focal length . yes i know i lost convenience 70-200 zoom lens . but i am really happy i decide change plan buying 70-200is 135/2l+ 1.4 . this not only saves me money but also let me get better pictures , especially wide open . better portrait lenses , like 200/ 1.8 300/ 2.8 , would cost several thousands dollars . trust me , once you play primes , you not like zoom anymore . i am also using 24-70l shoot my small kid . after using this lens , i don't like it anymore thinking change primes someday , only reason preventing me doing 1.6 crop factor digital camera . 35mm/ 1.4 become 56mm which really not good . order amazon free shipping even though it says not stock . they shipped mine 2 days this happened before even though item stated " stock soon " . pros : very sharp f2 super sharp start 2.5 . very fast lens f/2very good bokeh ( background blurring ) . overall extremely good picture quality good contrast/color . smaller size , less weight black color compare those white 70-200s . it lens : best build quality , fast/quiet ring usm af ftm . cons : no hard case . no inexpensive . effective focal length 216mm 10d/20d/rebel/300d which little difficult use portrait	1
this one four cameras , only digital camera , i used learn portrait photography . class how take portraits not how use camera . i wanted graduate point shoot but consider my budget because i wanted slr film camera also . i got canon rebel ti packed two lenses . it made sense me purchase canon digital interchange lenses . my original choice canon digital rebel , however , my web search , i found eos 10d $750 no catch . there no required additional purchases scam when i called . this allowed me spend extra money i would spent camera accessories . since it digital , i am not shy trying out features . when i first got camera , some photos dark or very light . after tinkering around learning what sensor-indicators means i don't get anymore . 10d more camera than i need i'm sure i it long time .	1
this good , affordable uv filter protecting your expensive lenses . i leave it my lens all time . this particular filter ( l-39 sharp cut ) especially good wide angle lenses ( lt ; 24mm focal length ) , because its ultrathin profile , which prevents vignetting . i used regular filters wide angle lenses , very bad results . although this filter not multi-coated , i not found it big deal pictures i've taken . multi-coated uv filters cost 2x or 3x price this one , which i don't think worthwhile . all all , i recommend this filter canon or non-canon lenses	1
i'm very happy my speedlite 580ex , new dimension my photographic hobb	1
this , my very humble opinion , most useful , sharpest , just anything else good you think say , best wide angle lense ever produced anybody , anytime , anywhere . lightning fast that what you want when light low . my gal pal sara i often wandered caribbean islands dawn early light , she into shooting old homes . she particularly likes gingerbread homes marigot , french side st. martin . i swear she must them all her hard drive . it like obsession her this lens aids her passion , feeds into her manic desire try control light . she just loves it since i love her , i gotta love it too . seriously though , i've used lense quite bit myself it keeper if ever there one . you just go wrong canon " " lense , no siree . jack priest , sailor home se	1
i like using tripod my long zoom lens , this device really added my hobby . remote perfect taking pictures birds my birdbath squirrels other critters my yard . i personally don't like cables , i don't like dealing them . this just right my purposes . remote also better taking pics people . it much better than timer my opinion since i move people out easier more efficiently , taking pictures more quickly . this gives me so much more control than using timer .	1
i am very happy this set filters . price right they come carry case so you dont worry how you going carry them if you go lite , camera filters	-1
this lens works really fast . it great lens . captures color real depth detail my canon 20d camera	1
very happy lens , price definately right amateur like myself	1
i upgraded canon digital rebel ( grey body ) this because i ready take my photography new level . one thing i like most this camera it flash compenstation . i purchased 430ex flash it because i tired use built flash always getting those hard shadows wall	1
this excellent battery powers my canon 5d camera very well . although i haven't tested it against spec how many shots i get it , i've very impressed longevity it charge	1
this uv filter produces high quality pictures fraction cost many ather brands	1
make sure check compatibility charts verify your lenses work this before buying it since only handful series lenses compatible . if you already one or more these lenses though this nice addition . af only works lenses f/4 faster most camera bodies . you also give up little image quality putting this your lens camera body , but extra reach really nice	-1
this good tool , job well , serves purpose , but little overpriced canon keeps changing connectors , forcing us buy new accessories which wrong practice against consumer . i give 4 star because canon , not because product . if you willing pay it , it good product .	-1
ive gotten used disposable kodaks i got checkout isle walmart . problem those , though , they run out pictures pretty quick . last straw when we ran out film family reunion just cousin billy show us how catch lizard rubber band twinky . point i knew i needed upgrade . i ordered canon eos-1ds mark ii next day , [ ... ] feature first caught my attention powerful zoom . now when i take family picture , i like step back mile or two , then zoom snap high-resolution masterpeice . my wife always complains i zoom too close into big pores her nose , which i respond suggesting she use clean clear pore cleansing strips ( watch her upcoming review those soon ) . useful feature this camera continuous shooting mode . this where camera automatically takes pictures rapid succession , 5 per second . other day i set camera dresser , turned macarena , got wild . i then took individual pictures strung them together into animated flipbook . now watching myself macarena mere flip book away . man i dance . summarize , you lot fun this cam like i . definitely worth [ ... ] ! but remember , there [ ... ] comes it ; so make sure you fill item number clearly [ ... ] card , make sure you stay within space alloted form otherwise [ ... ] wont go through	1
very good rechargable battery pack . holds charge long time even if camera not used much . capable taking many shots plenty review time . very pleased it	1
this lens fantastic very fast . colors blow you away . 2.8 stop set very fast sutter speeds . i put this lens my reble xt i dont want take it off . love it amazon great .........	1
i bought rebel xt w/ 18-55 lens exactly 18 hours before xti introduced , but that story . this my first dslr , i blown away results . but after initial euphoria , there always room improvement . my first choice 28-200 , favoring longer zoom over , but i found this one used penn camera got deal it 380ex flash , so decision made me . i like zoom range , it great framng portraits . if i need wider angle , i still kit lens . i won't make usual complaints herky-jerky zoom ring or rackety extension tubes , i prepared this these reviews before i ever saw lens . i'm no expert sharpness , still trying get myself dialed , but my shots so far look pretty sharp me . i no " " lenses compare , nor would i make comparison if i . my somewhat uninformed opinion , this great step up kit lens . this lens working guy afford most likely get great results . working guy , i'm extremely happy it so far , glad i made purchase .	-1
eos-1d mark ii digital this camera i use two months little hard use because it lot things . i am not proffecianal but i liked very much pictures best like any camera i .	1
this lens great . i've doing portraits just random snapshots it makes every picture beautiful ! only downside lack ability zoom . other than it great lens	-1
i highly recommend this super wide angle lens anyone wanting take landscape pictures , buildings or lots other stuff ! it so different than standard kit lens ( 18-55 ) . you won't sorry when you start learning all possibilities extraordinary lens	1
slightly smaller than charger comes s(40 , 45 , 50 ,... ) series cameras digital rebel series cameras . seems charge same time . feels bit more substantial , but that not saying much chargers come those cameras seem pretty flimsy . i can't give it 5 stars because it nothing more than chargers come cameras ( which i lost )	-1
holds all my lenses , camera body , remote , card reader , etc ... room spare . compares bags costing 3 times more .	1
i won kodak printer scrapbook convention then went hunt find refills reasonable price . purchasing 160 count made price per print lowest beat out anything i could find local stores . it great convenience able whip out 4x6 print instead download it store website , wait few days , go there pick it up , etc . great value	1
this lens gotten some bad reviews , i think , partly because it starting show it age . this first usm lens , technology really grown since then . if canon come updated 75-300 usm lens , man , it would blow everything away . said , yes , this lens little slow focus . but , if you not using it work like one professional sports photographers you see sidelines baseball games , you should okay . it also could use extra stop ( or two , or three ! ) because when you handholding , you need aperture open it . all this aside , i really gotten some gems pictures out this lens . it lets you get closer then you possibly could hope . if you asteady hand plently availible light , you get some really nice shots . if you low light situation ... you need tripod . lens works ... pretty good , but i number ever so slightly blurry pictures wouldn't there some more aperature room play . all all , its good starter telephoto lens , especially digital slrs since it really extends zoom those . its great price , when you decide upgrade one those white canon beauties , just sell it	1
lens fulfilled all our expectations quality portraits field view flexibility . stabilization aspect great help , although it doesn't compensate someone pushing shutter too fast low light conditions . highly recommend this lens standard use lens canon rebel xt	1
excellent product , easy use , great edging cards making trims cards craftwork . i can't wait experiment it	1
other than months waiting nikon deliver them amazon shipping , battery itself good deal . they work well , charge up easy hold their charge nicely . priced well , they cost less than same type battery than canon or sony . i bought them d80 older en-el3a would not fit . course i 10 older batteries my d70s rather surprised when they didn't fit d80 . basically same size shape , but keyed differently . i also surprised find 3e would fit d70s , meaning they backward compatable .	-1
this monopod great job my camera . you quick , easy-off , it attatches your camera screw , you press button side monopod just slide your camera right off it quickly . i wanted nice , inexpensive monopod my new zoom lense . i canon 35mm , i recently purchased 75-300 zoom lense it , i needed monopod stabilize shoot . if i knew then what i know now , i would buy it again . nice product	1
pros : - reduces flare ghosting when shooting bright light . - helps protect your lens dirt scratches . - somewhat protects lens case fall . better break hood than front element . - makes you look more like you know what you doing helps keep others carelessly walking front you . cons : - increase lens movement windy situations , kind like sail boat . - takes up more room your bag , even when reversed they still add diameter lens . - people take more notice you , help blow your cover if you trying keep low profile	-1
i love new digital canon . only problem it not nearly tough it film twin . i camera less than month when pop-up flash quit working . canon people great , very helpful , but i'd rather not send brand new camera back factory . photos , however , wonderful . film quality most part - printable enlargable . ( it would probably better use camera tripod when using 300mm telephoto but i hike it , so just remember steady it before taking wildlife photos .	-1
sony it again ! fast charging long lasting , this battery perfect my sony cyber-shot camera !	1
i just got back vacation . i bad back , it sore . i very happy discover way this bag hangs , i could carry my nikon d-70 one or two extra lens very comfortably . gear super easy access bag provides nice platform changing lenses . i other bags which heft lots gear , they're great travel days occasional big shoot , but if you're looking hike ( separate way carry tripod ) , then this wonderful bag	1
if you shooting compact chip camera like 20d or rebel xt , you happier 8mm fisheye . this 15mm fisheye just really distorted wide angle lens due 1.6 factor . if you love fish eye style camera , you'll need something wider compensate your smaller chip . i disapointed this lens reason . sigma 8mm great . note reviewer below . sigma makes some good lenses bad ones . this good one you probably got bad copy . it happens often enough sigma gear . this lens , its good go try one your local camera shop make sure it style you want . bring your camera chip it take few shots go home check them out . decide if you like style if piece glass good copy . i got good copy still disapointed because my lack knowledge . sounds like you got bad one	-1
i am no means pro taking pictures , but this camera makes me look close it . so far i just used it point shoot pictures really good quality . i am tring learn more functions one i run across so far i enjoy you choose certain functions your photo black white , color , or sepia . i am not high tech but i use this camera pretty easily . my first digital camera canon digital elf only 3.2 mega pixels there huge difference quality pictures when you compare . so if you affored spend more more mega pixels it . only down sides i seen so far it doesn't come w/ great memory card which most not i imagine if i not small hands camera would little awkward handle . it lots buttons dials so you hold just right so you don't hit any . but overal i am very satisfied w/ my purchase hope become better photographer help this camera . canon cameras served my family i very well over years	-1
xti feature laden , but takes fantastic " point shoot " photos . seems significant improvement canon rebel xt , wonderful camera . money , best slr going	1
every picture mine included larger portions sky would these stubborn spores it . pretty infuriating , especially when you got shot just like you wanted it . yes , you always remove those photoshop ( or cheaper yet , gimp ); but isn't it cool when you look picture say : " it , nothing it ! " ?? it wasn't just sky . any off-white but light plain colored background would suffer visibly acursed specks . this blower , greatly priced ( pity adorama doesn't free shipping though ) , i put my camera tripod , pointed it down , squirted three or four times - gone specs !!! great buy dslr owners	1
easy use , including zoom uploading computer . nice clear photos when printed out	-1
after checking prices all usual pricing bots , i found better price , including free shipping , going directly amazon . this lowest price not appear other searches , so it pays go amazon first . i replaced my canon sd400 casio find controls more logical use . this important if you don't use camera while , because you just pick it up start shooting without hunting manual . also , docking base much more convenient than plugging small cables into camera . you not remove battery casio charge it you canon sd400 . vga movie quality superior casio . still pictures appear equal . amazon delivered ups record time even weekend inbetween . i ordered friday received it following tuesday . go amazon !	1
there already tons reviews eos 300d ( digital rebel ) but i want share my experience camera , so i keep this short . i bought this camera 5 months ago i am love . i not new photography or slr , but new world digital slr . i previously used ancient minolta x-570 , " pro-sumer " 35mm film slr vivitar 35-105 standard zoom lens . first foremost this camera takes excellent pictures , very high quality no distortion i seen . this camera particularly good beginner dslr because there so many options use learn . but until you ready take advantage all featues , you use this just like point shoot . battery life excellent so far : thought i would suggest getting extra backup long days taking photos . i also quite happy kit lens , which i wasn't sure i would like since it not versatile lens i using my minolta . but kit lens proved great learning tool : i able take some great shots , while also learning what kinds other , better lenses i would like add my setup . ** only issue i problem sandisk 2gb cf card . after 300 shots , camera froze stopped responding card . i able salvage most photos after fact , but don't risk it . if you're serious enough spend this kind money camera , spend little extra money sandisk ultra ii line high-speed cards .	1
i got this camera my 17th birthday last summer , it great . much i'd love canon powershot , it bit out my price range . all people who think using lcd screen runs out batteries after quot ; 2-4 picturesquot ; lying you . i bought rechargable batteries radioshack , i've taken up 400 picture without batteries needing changed . this good camera good quality good lighting . dark or overcast situations , it look bit grainy , but that easily photoshopped . i recommend when uploading , plug it into wall digital camera adapter , because uploading sucks all battery power right out . i recommend this someone who hasn't owned digital camera before , or someone wants good quality not-so-crazy price	-1
this lens exactly what it should . overall quality extremely good . take look my photos : - first photo without lens- second photo lens flash- third photo lens without flashthere few things note photos : - there substantial amount barrel distortion . this normal . try not straight lines near borders photo make it less obvious . - fringing exaggerated . you notice fringing ( purple or blue tints ) high contrast edges objects near borders . you see this regular shots but more exaggerated wide angle lens . - lens makes shadow when using built-in flash . you see shadow photo flash . darker environment , it very obvious . external flash only way fix this . couple details : - you get extender nice brushed aluminum here : http://www.lensmateonline.com/s2.html- camera setting ( converter ) indicate you lens attached . it not obvious what it but it indicated change image stabilization icon so i assume it affects way image stabilization works . overall , i recommend this lens	-1
previous review not completely correct . problem not product but description what amazon.com put up canon cpm-e3 battery magazine . it battery magazine canon compact battery pack cp-e3 not camera battery grip . i think product itself great thing , it lets you switch whole magazine 8 preloaded batteries instead replacing batteries canon compact battery pack cp-e3 . previous reviewer should not judge product incorrect infromation given retailer	1
canon three digital cameras $ 2,500 + . 1ds mark ii , 1d mark iin relatively new 5d . i chose canon over nikon ( which i've shot most my photographic life ) because canon more impressive suite lenses . here decision process i went through . most products , it comes down how you'll use it . all them tradeoffs . 1 . megapixels . more pixels - few caveats - translates into image enlarged ( cropped more tightly)with less deterioration . 1ds market leader 16.7 mp , 5d comes 12.7 mp 1d 8.2 mp . if you're commercial art or magazine photographer 1ds probably makes sense . if you're wedding photographer , 5d probably sweet spot . practice , however , difference pixels these cameras not make appreciable difference most people . 8.2 mp , you make 11x17 print 200 pixels/inch without any enlargement beyond camera native resolution . up size , you certainly won't see much difference prints three cameras . said , higher megapixels other cameras gives you more extreme cropping lattitude . 2 . full frame . 1ds 5d full frame - means sensor camera capture view scene you're accustomed seeing your 35 mm film camera . 1d most digital cameras what called field view crop factor ( fovcf ) . 1d , it 1.3 . what means both viewfinder image sensor don't capture everying lens " seeing " - it crops view little tighter . result : your lenses effectively 1.3 longer . 70 mm lens becomes 91 mm lens so . because camera effectively " cropping " edges image lens produces , it also tends eliminate softness or vignetting appears edges some lenses . whatever camera you use , what you see viewfinder still what you get , it doesn't affect pixel resolution image . my 300 mm lens 1.4 extender 1.3 fovcf effectively 546 mm lens - getting into birding territory . ( if you're switching film digital , some your lenses may may no longer fit your needs focvf . your 35 mm lens no longer really wide angle 45 mm . ) 3 . durability . this most important me , though it may not someone who doesn't shoot extreme conditions or expects replace their camera two years . both 1ds 1d sport complete metal bodies , sealed against weather shutter last least 200,000 cycles . 5d - very solid camera - designed 100 , 000 , not weather sealed more plastic components . 4 . weight/size . what solid , metal body giveth durability it taketh away weight . those who prefer camera heft , these it . many people , this big drawback . 1ds 1d 43 oz ., or almost three pounds just body , without big battery . add battery you're 54 oz . 5d just 29 oz . 31 oz . battery . 1ds 1d , built-in vertical grips , also more than 2 inches taller . if you're looking something less obtrusive easier carry around , 5d it . 5 . speed . there reason 1d camera choice photojournalists , sports many bird photographers . it shoots smooth 8.5 frames per second , compared 4 fps 1ds 3 fps 5d . most day-to-day uses , 3 fps more than adequate . using both , i'd say 1d autofocuses bit faster , too . 1d 45 autofocus points , compared nine 5d . 6 . price . give or take hundred here or there , 1ds $ 7,200 ; 1d $ 3,900 ; 5d $ 3,000 . price determine whether you get 1ds or not . if you afford it , go it . otherwise , other features - or possiblity buying more lenses instead more camera - make your decision . what i decide ? first , i looked how i'd use camera : photojournalism , travel wildlife photography . higher fps not important me durability autofocus speed , so either 1d or 1ds would . end , i decided i'd rather spend money lenses would not obsolete next new improved camera . ( i bought 300 f/ 2.8 close difference price . ) so , i went 1d mark iin . if my camera generating some good cash flow or my wife didn't need new car , i'd probably gone 1ds . i'm very happing decision camera . most people most uses - general portrait , landscape travel photography - 5d probably way go . ( or perhaps next greatest camera canon announce later this year .	1
i bought 250d lens use my sony dsc-f717 it just wonderful . i also use it my canon g3 because i bought canon ladc58b conversion lens adapter ( which required inexpensive ) . i hearing lot good things this lens digital photography forums i seen many wonderful examples its use . i recommend this lens anyone who wants make their " macro " photography shine . get one ! just clear there 52mm 58mm don't confused which one fit your camera . edit : just clarification : this one ' ' " 58mm " even though above ( this page ) when you click links " see more technical details " " see all product description " it mentions " 52mm " . this misleading confusing . very very top this page it says " 58mm " . let me just assure you this particular one ' ' " 58mm " ' not ' " 52mm " . late edit ( aug 04 , 06 ): well , it looks if amazon finally corrected misleading info i mentioned just above my clarification	1
i love new digital canon . only problem it not nearly tough it film twin . i camera less than month when pop-up flash quit working . canon people great , very helpful , but i'd rather not send brand new camera back factory . photos , however , wonderful . film quality most part - printable enlargable . ( it would probably better use camera tripod when using 300mm telephoto but i hike it , so just remember steady it before taking wildlife photos .	-1
canon rs-60e3 all canon says it .... it simple one handed operation switch open flash , focus , then release shutter once , multiple times , or hold it open bulb exposure . although cord not long enough include photographer picture , it simple enough make " extension " allows very remote exposures	1
2 years heavy use - not even one little bitty problem . they've traveled well under harsh conditions , they still function wonderfully . there you go	1
i wish there also photo showed backside this camera case . if there i would known this excellent quality case unfortunately not belt loop which what i looking this product . great quality nevertheless	1
i , like many people , research high-tech purchases before buying because complexity items invariably high cost some items . digital cameras no exception . i looking replacement my konicaminolta dimage z1 . my requirements fairly straight forward : new camera 10x zoom , no less than 5mp processing chip , third , get my photography skills point camera after this new one could dslr . i read reviews here amazon regarding performance s9000 , while some them , i felt , right , others not read professional reviews before purchasing this camera . intended use this camera never point shooter . while s9000 possess automatic functions " streamline " use , these features whoafully inadequate overall optical proccessing capibilities fuji strove it design . let me clarifications ' sake say this loud clear : if you want breathtakingly beautiful , clear , vibrant pictures perfect exposure using this camera , then you must use manual settings . this not point shoot type camera !!!!!! out box s9000 godsend . not only images super sharp no hint edge fall off hampers other high res cameras , but exposure so perfect i question my ability luck . setups very easy controls functions snap . white balance shutter speed settings not easy concepts grapple potography , yet fuji made short work them their intuitive design . there really two photographic miracles work s9000 : one , processor captures detail color you feel guilty paying so little something better than much more expensive equipment , two , exposure so good if i not know better , i would think i using advanced film slr . this absolute rave this product . fit finish superb , ergos comfortable controls easy find use , it fulfilled my need camera would get me ready dslr but not too complex . only downside this camera it take time process image before exposure , but outside some dslrs , this problem all digital cameras . it true this camera big heavy , but then photographic perfection ain't free . home run fuji !!	1
black this same my camera , all parts together , this one professional looking set up ! i am not sure if this hood cuts down glare/reflection , i not used it sunny day , but i don't see why it shouldn't . cheap this little product , it pretty much must this camera ! ( s3 ) one last side note , should you alreay own extra lens or two . they happen metal , very carful screwing them into this plastic adaptor ! i made mistake put whole thing fridge hour , so metal would shrink , i could get pieces apart	-1
okay , first off , i'd like say this my first af slr -- i stepped up my dinosaur camera , canon ae-1 manual focus , right now i am quite overwhelmed all features this little thing . i'm still learning stages all this technology but let me tell you this , i am fun ! it amazes me canon offer quite impressive camera price . i just received my first few rolls developer pictures came out amazing -- so clear colors very vibrant . just let you know , i'm using 28-105mm f/ 3.5 - 4.5 usm lens . i took suggestions many passed up " kit " lens i'm sure glad i so . i would highly recommend f/ 3.5 - 4.5 lens , but unfortunately rest you , amazon discontinued it . but you could order it one many other photo shops ( bh , adorama , etc ) . i any regrets this purchase ? absolutely not ! i love this camera even though i've owned it less than month , i'm actually thinking stepping up eos 3 using this backpacking/hiking body . hmm ... what , what ? i purchase body or start collection l-series glass ? ... question .	1
not much add other positive reviews posted , other than i am user loves my d50 . it year now shot over 10,000 photos excellent results ( mostly landscape wildlife ) . excellent image quality hand grip fits perfectly both my hand my husbands . only con i think this time there no backlight top panel - this makes it difficult adjust settings low/ no light situations . also , people used little compact point shoot cameras this might seem little overwhelming first bulky carry around ( which why i little pocket camera my purse ) . i also got 18-200 lens love it - perfect walk around lens	1
although this good batch accessories , camera case itself little unhandy times . it no carry strap -- camera strap sticks out through slit top . so , if you want carry case strap you decide take picture , you must open case , pull camera strap through slit , then lift camera out . it would not keep me buying this but it make it unhandy	-1
canon bg-e3 battery grip one awesome extra you cannot without . i found extra weight size not even minor burden . i rec'd product 2 days after initial receiving date/17th st photo fantastic job ( once again )	1
i using this lens 2.5 years it exceptional piece equipment , especially price ! i very rarely feel need get closer image than i achieve this lens . it very solidly built i am sure it continue primary piece my kit years come	1

i love new digital canon . only problem it not nearly tough it film twin . i camera less than month when pop-up flash quit working . canon people great , very helpful , but i'd rather not send brand new camera back factory . photos , however , wonderful . film quality most part - printable enlargable . ( it would probably better use camera tripod when using 300mm telephoto but i hike it , so just remember steady it before taking wildlife photos .	-1
hi rebel extreme , needed use high-speed mode ... but flash couldn't even vaguely keep up . i taking pictures dancers , so needed flash system could keep up . speedlite really this perfectly - i'm able take rapid-fire sequence photos , this flash system there each time . i don't know if it really helps when taking single photo , but if you want flash keep up , this one great ! i like it so much , i'm planning buying one or two more my next shoot , run slave mode this one .	1
camera handles very well - it light drives my zoom lens 18-55mm lens beautifully . i get professional photographs use it all day without suffering heavy weight , which it not . view finder excellent readout back camera extremely helpful , showing photos they taken - zoom back screen , which immediately gives me idea photo i want use my books . i say this outstanding lens camera .	1
i use this gem my 20d my 24-105mm , far i'm concerned it one best optical lenses out there . my 24-105 isn't ideal indoor/low light lens nor it ideal sports photography lens ( although it sharp , just not quite long enough ) 70-200 fills gap my arsenal boot ! photos i've taken so far sidelines all keepers . if you afford it , it , you won't regret i	1
i needed this tripod use my 20x50 binoculars since least movement 20x magnification causes subject wind up outside viewing field . this tripod works well use . it sturdy , lots features reasonably priced . however , if you wish use tripod binoculars , right angle adapter needed . i found one ebay few dollars .	1

digital rebel most amazing camera i've ever owned . my previous camera canon a90 i loved using all features it [ great camera ! ] . i decided recently maybe i should graduate slr because i starting get more creative my photography . i spent great deal time researching cameras finally decided digital rebel . after few months owning it i still am amazed . image quality fantastic , it quick responsive , every day using it i learn little more . it perfect intro slr camera me because everything makes sense it easy learn . i've gotten amazing shots i could never dream getting point shoot . if you finding yourself wanting little more than point shoot , go this camera , you wont sorry .	1
i started battery grip initially wanting double battery availability . used 35mm hand strap already realizing value stability such strap , this my second attraction purchase battery grip last but not all least , ability use shoot grip itself , allowing full ease rotation camera . though i never used battery magazine allows use aa batteries , it offers backup should canon batteries need charging i am heat shooting . i always travel my charge four aa batteries . i would recommend this grip standard accessory eos-20d eos 30-d . one thought consider once camera it increases overall height creating challanges some camera cases .	1
this great lens . i not want repeat all good things other reviewers written this lens . it not so heavy so i use tripod without using tripod collar ( costs 119.99 ) . this best value i ever got lens . now i can't wait get 17-40mm f4l too . you get very nice bokeh when wide open f4 5.6 , course depending how far background subject . people complain how ugly hood looks but subjective . i like it because it works great you attach it reversed position lens so it fit your camera bag . i think fit finish lens beautiful	1
not knowing fully what i getting into , whim i purchased this monopod hoping half-way decent product , i mean-it so cheap . i pleasantly surprised find how sturdy unit what i very high quality monopod . this my second monopod so i compare it ( other bought auction website ) . comparison opteka far better monopod height robust thickness i use it exclusively my minidv shoots	1
this my first very expensive entry into digit slr photography . i used canon point shoot digital camera previously . i avoiding dslr because i used rarely use my eos film slr . convienience point shoot experience overwhelming . unfortunately so it limitations . so back i came , only choice though expensive eos 5d it full frame sensor ! pain reduced double rebates . wow ! this revelation ! beautifull images , lot control . i notice af not fast my old elan iie . i also disappointed price there lack weather sealing . i am not happy canon this , but i really appreciate them making full frame sensor difficult marketable slot far their line up concerned . this camera also needs prime or lenses , because sensor reveal inadequacies inferior lenses . this add cos t.t his exceptional photographic tool i hope use improve my skill i explore all it capabilities	1
i purchased this case my canon a530 camera . i find it great job light , durable , compact . it keeps camera clean scratch free . however i wish case better carrying capacity . i would liked bit more space spare batteries chips . i use different ones different pictures or video . batteries tend give out after long day shooting convient extras would handy . case beltloops but not good shoulder strap times when belt not worn . bit akward . otherwise this case good protector my camera fits it well .	-1
i wanted get macro lens everyone told me this one get ... i'm so glad i . smaller sensor my 30d , 100mm more like 150mm or so , so it nice , wide-open telephoto/portrait lens well . i've uploaded few photos i've taken w/ this lens show what it capable macro telephoto . i thought 17mm-85mm usm lens came e/ my camera sharp - but compared this lens , kit lens might well diy pinhole camera . my less than perfect rating there no image stabilization available macro lenses . when i'm trying hone bees pollenating flower , there lot shake . i can't practically use tripod when insects bouncing bud bud , so i take 100 shots get one that not shake blur - i miss some really cool shots . addition lack image stabilization , i am frustrated w/ sometimes unpredictable focusing happen lens trying decide whether it should focusing telephoto or macro . i wish there switch lens make it macro only or telephoto only , so it wouldn't bouncing one focal length other all time . i've taken far more successful telephoto shots than macro . telephoto focal length bit long ( those us who cannot afford full-frame sensor camera ) most casual photography . i recently used this lens shoot some promo shots some massage therapists small eatery . i practically set up restaurant bathroom get photos i wanted , but opted this lens because it much faster ( 2.8 ) i wanted use natural light over flash . lens long heavy its range . addition battery pack grip , this lens added very weighty , so i may not take it w/ me my kit bag every shoot . once i add short fixed focal length lens moderate telephoto my kit , my guess this lens pulled out only special occasions . it tack-sharp , but it frustrating times	-1
i love bag all reasons others not like it . product listed gadget bag what it good . s2 large camera point shoot it fits very few bags . this bag fit camera easily space all types extras including batteries , chargers extra media cards . there also enough room small digital camera or film point shoot . correct way advertise this case would up two bodies or four small lens . given limitation , this great bag . bag very well made holds my canon powershot s2 very securely . i lay camera it back means even if i accidently power it lens opens harmlessly . material great waist belt very practical . strap well padded after day use i believe it one most comfortable straps i used . buy this bag correct camera you very happy it .	-1
got lowero slingshot 100 2 months ago , it really coming handy . main area , it holds my pentax digital slr one lens mounted , 1 rather small lens 1 decently big zoom lens ( 80-320mm ) , plus sigma ef-500 super flash . it packed there , flash just barely fits , but i don't need much more room . top compartment holds extra batteries , recharger , etc . really easy access main pocket when it my back ... just pulling case my front ( no need take it off my back ) . well made . zippers strong so i don't worry one loosening my equipment falling out . perfect amateur semi-pro photographer .	1
this lens amazing . nothing escapes it . it like black hole . clearly best lens i ever owned . it like lidless eye sauron lord rings . it heavy requires rethinking how you hold camera . it comes beautiful case , hood , tripod mount lens . believe me you need it . i took few photos my son 250 feet away they look great . i now get work reading small manual . it 2 focal settings 2 stabilizing settings . wow !	1
i think it very well could so i'm not going differ those who say it . i bought this use new 5d itt simply outstanding every regard . so far , i've kept it 5d can't bring myself take it off . i considered couple lenses , including 24-105 f/4 which lot appeal price same . but this lens i chose part because i already 70-300mm f/ 4.5 - 5.6 lens overlap seemed waste while extra stop helps . i no regrets it . sharp tack quick . i note this not compact lens , especially hood it stretch out lot when you widen field . it also not light . this lens 5d give your neck back pain , assuming you work more than one camera . but focal lengths covered just ideal require none compromises longer zoom range require . , i've got 18-200 20d . 70-300 , while not , specs out range virtue real compactness , but it ' not lightweight . these two lenses cover just everything me . i keep 10-22mm 20d extra-wide shots . since writing initial review , i've since traveled several weeks this lens it fully lived up expectations . given difficulties travel these days , i am concerned problem not able carry it me -- not problem date except britain . but always possible . , despite weight , i might favor 70-200 f/ 2.8 usm second travel lens- i like brightness focus . one suggestion . there temptation use this lens wide open lot time . it very good sometimes that best thing . but i've also found this lens makes beautiful images stopped down good deal short night time exposures tripod remote release . effect lights , etc . considerably different extended depth field .	1
it great compact camera good zoom . i now leave larger lens my nikon dx 70 use this closer shots . you need try different settings make sure you get color you want . i really like it most general quick shots , carry it wth me most time	-1
i camera w/ 12x optical tons features but i wanted something compact ready take quick snaps . this fits bill . my recent vacation i impressed how quickly it booted up focused get those unplanned shots . x-large screen makes it really easy see if you got good one image stabilisation seems work better than my previous camera ( canon a80 ) ... either or my hand steadier . last but not least - battery life impeccable . i took nearly 200 photos , plus spent lot time reviewing showing off pics friends no need recharge . battery ' custom ' one which concerned me but charger very compact travels well . it integrated prongs fold flat when not use - no cables :)	1
i just got this camera month ago i am satisfied it . it lot features despite its size . point shoot i say it great buy , comparable other power packed cameras , it even takes better pictures sometimes . but i just give it 4 because i thought i could more it . but you can't much settings since it it own default settings certain conditions . but over all it great camera . if you're just after taking normal pictures you want something sleek , this definitely good buy .	-1
despite reading glowing reviews this lens , i still surprised see how well it performed . lens so sharp you get very good cropped pictures running athletes , distance three quarters football field away , shooting hand held , late afternoon light , which print 5x7 still look like pro took them ! if you want tack sharp lens indoor sports pictures can't afford , or otherwise not want long lens outdoor sports pictures , then you should give this lens your serious consideration .	1
i use this little gadget mainly macro portrait work . when you it light emitting flash diffused which gives you more flattering less contrasty light illuminate your subjects . unless you going very shadowy , high-contrast , image this diffuser save day . it very light weight easy pack small places , so you should never good reason leave it behind . sometimes it simple things make biggest difference photo , using this defiantly make very noticeable differences	-1
love this battery . long lasting just good name brand	-1
i took this me recently australia shot landscapes well others , pictures came out better than film cameras i used recently , plus you don't need scanner . this camera works great , must semi-pros . pros , wait new 1d . pictures come out great 11quot ; x17quot ;	1
first thing make sure which lens you buying . kit lens comes canon 20d , 30d , 300d , or xt lower version , non usm one . higher version usm ones , you see red color " usm " front lens . according reviews , compare non usm ones , optically they same . however , usm motor focus faster much quieter . people complain build quality . actually i feel it really not bad , much better than canon 50mm 1.8 ii . usm auto focus performance fast , never hunt , much quieter than 50mm 1.8 ii . it fits nicely xt . not compare this hundred dollar lens other lenses cost three times or more . we compare apple apple . if you know limitations this lens use it wisely , images come out nicely . 1 . this not lens indoors low light conditions . if you need take lots indoor pictures flash not allowed , go get different lens . ( example , i use canon 50mm 1.4 this kind situation . ) 2 . distortion 18mm quite bit . avoid taking strait lines ( like buildings ) pictures edge while wide open . however , this easily corrected computers . 3 . step down aperture f8 or f11 , resolution improved lot even corners . overall , performance very good hundred dollar lens . it very light weight highly portable while traveling . this fits my needs cheap but fast good image quality walk around lens .	-1
i'm very pleased this small unit great deal power . it compact , not heavy , adjustable power output simply spinning wheel camera left or right . addition light output , head tilted so light direct or bounced , excellent feature . getting up running this unit breeze because i am totally " brochure reading averse . " twenty years ago i photographer big equipment , but given up both . i surprised control one such small relatively inexpensive unit	1
this great camera . plenty resolution . excellent shot speed . sturdy frame . kit lense doesn't camera justice . buy body separate add better lense . bad side , i small glitch camera firmware soon after purchase return it fix . it two months before camera returned . sorry , canon ... you lose star	-1
this lens only two " faults . " first , it big heavy -- quality construction often yields heavy lens . second , once photographer seen results this lens produce , there likelihood he or she unhappy other lenses camera bag . results first : images razor sharp this zoom mounted my nikon d70s . i get shots i never could get before because this lens so crisp subjects taken distance nevertheless cropped produce acceptable close-up image . subjects taken more normal distances breathtakingly sharp -- if shot excellent prime lens . this fast lens ( f/ 2.8 throughout its entire zoom range ) . almost more importantly , this lens best " bokeh " i ever experienced lens . " bokeh , " extent i understand concept ( it japanese word meaning roughly " unfocused " ) , word describing whether out-of-focus portion image ( i.e. blurred background photo which only subject focus ) pleasing look it . this lens produces wonderful , creamy bokeh . sharpness bokeh , combined excellent bright color rendition this lens , makes this one true classic . i occasionally experienced minor ghosting this lens when shooting into very bright subject , i.e. sun reflecting off ocean . this normal shortfall zoom lens comprised multitude elements , i sometimes experienced this . but such occasions rare . autofocusing action this lens very good . even birds very long distances usually produce quick , snappy autofocus lock my nikon d70s . very seldom it " hunt " af lock , these occasions likely due operator error rather than lens . this lens also features vibration reduction ( vr ) which enables it produce acceptable images below what f/ 2.8 lens would otherwise suitable . vr really works , too , although it no means panacea dim lighting . this one nikon professional lenses , quality construction excellent . critical mount metal , entire lens built like tank . lens comes nice squeeze-style lens cap , very good lens hood easily reversed storage . reader see i am extremely enamored this lens . reason , notwithstanding its bulk weight , this lens produces best nature shots i ever managed take , far .	1

i am professional photographer , i owned this camera nearly two years . i also d70 backup . batteries go forever , it very quick respond , images beautiful , it typical nikon durability reliability . if you already nikon user , controls fall easily hand . said , computer software this camera joke . best image quality shoot raw files , color balance grey card , render images software like capture one le . uselessness included software only reason this camera gets four instead five stars . come , nikon , real !!! shortly after i got my first d70 , i shot model small photo side bar catalog . i got ugly feeling my gut when i told designer taken shot 3/4 figure , cropped head shoulders , enlarged image cover 8.5 11 catalog . time i found out , it already printer . it turned out , i pleasantly surprised : cover shot looked great . after incident , i trusted this camera always pleased results . this camera better than 35 mm every way except response shutter button . resolution color reproduction it more comparable medium format film camera . it imperative shoot raw process files properly get most out this camera . i can't wait try d80	-1

photos excellent . but photo print quality depends very much print shop . same photo file , it look like 4m photo when taken below quality printer shop . photos taken indoor marginal lighting ( no flash used ) turned out yellowish . battery life very long despite its large 3 " lcd . battery charging time over 3 hours - too long . photos files viewed computer looks just great . 8'x10 ' prints great but not tried larger prints . touch screeen control delight very easy choose set . date photo red ( would better if it black ) . location date not far right hand corner	1
this uv filter it job protect lens well . build solid ( metal construction ) . glass also descent quality . performance , it absorbs some uv light . uv light absorbtion hardly noticeable , probably sky 1-a haze filter version absorb more uv light than this lens which fine me . now , one problem which internal reflection . i've heard many people say it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out it not caused directly low light/night situation . internal reflection appear when there strong/bright source light comparison overall exposure ( surrounding environment ) . put it example ( which hopefully easier understand ) , when you take picture lamp during nightime light much brighter than surrounding area then you see internal reflection . you move position light closer sides/corner picture ( not center picture ) , internal reflection reduces finally dissapear ( if you move light far enough center ) . if light isn't too bright/contrast compare surrounding environment then there no internal reflection . but course most time , lamp nightime often very bright . but point i'm trying make internal reflection doesn't happen all time during low light or night time . additionally , internal reflection isn't only happening night . it also happen afternoon if you taking picture sun example . basically same rule above , how bright light source compared surrounding area , you move sun center photo near side internal reflection move side/dissapear ( also depending angle ) . but best way just remove filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you reduce occurence internal reflection identifying correctly when internal reflection occur then remove filter during those situation ( which not hard ) . i'm actually not fan lens filter ( any filter ) i think it only degrade picture quality we added layer sensor object , but i decided use them anyway all my lens . i would recommend everyone get one this filter if you don't any filter your lens yet . i use this filter my 50mm f/ 1.8 lens my 18-55mm lens .	-1
i went taking camera out its packing taking professional quality pictures twenty minutes . it amazing	1

i am only amateur photographer , but still . . . this small camera long nose gives performance one might expect slr film camer costing lot more , lot more complicated use . i caught digital bug sevearl years ago . my latest before this beauty simple little canon sureshot 3mp . great camera , but this camera same simplicity , but takes pictures which much more refined terms sharpeness not much more than i paid camera four years ago !! this panasonic lumix leica lens , which ' matched any other camera but it twin leica camera -- much more expensive piece equipment . long lens might put you off if you average family photog , but if you want all around 35mm-12x camera without huge heavy expensive bag lenses , like me , this baby you . it only looks massive . it quite lite manageable . i use it bird photographsy , but it could great any situation where you need get really close up just any lighting situation ultra-fine resolution . don't want spend mega bucks mega-camera ? this answer . i love it , i think your , too . easy use , easy wallet . if you're not quite there , try next model down , same focal length but 6 mp , couple hundred less . terrific buy . no , i don't work panasanic . i'm retired print editor . jim isha	1
hawaii , i spend plenty time water ... so underwater housing my camera almost necessity . i very happy results , shooting water ( snorkeling , etc ) above water ( surf footage-just watch out water spots lens ) . some my photos up view other parts page this housing . i treat things pretty roughly , using this year no problems . i am water it almost daily basis . i like able use all features camera ( minus downloading images or changing battery or cf card ) while camera housing-something you cannot always say when looking aftermarket housings non-canon manufactured . everything mates up cleanly works great , i am very happy my purchase . just remember rinse it off/soak it freshwater after taking it ocean or pool keep corrosion bay , put little light silicone grease o-ring trouble free use	1

we canoe/kayak down various rivers creeks . i wanted way take my $1500 camera water without fear damaging it . sports pack completely water proof ( up 7m ) . i've submersed case test real-life situation camera stayed dry . case not cause any noticeable reduction picture quality . it relatively simple operate assemble . you only basic functions camera while case , so you need change any setting camera before putting it case advanced camera features not able used . my only concern scratch resistance plastic over lens area . so far i haven't any problems but i've only taken river 30 hrs . all told , i'm very pleased if you plan filming or near water i would recommend this case	1

i bought this my new hdv fx1 camcorder , it works great . unlike century wide-angle lens , this fully zoom-through . lens . 8x , which less than century others , but just right hd -- since fx1 already pretty decent wide shot when zoom fully backed out , this just gives it extra boost , converting camera view roughly 35mm lens 35mm camera 28mm . also , very little barrel distortion . all great lens . only drawback it big ( heavy ) lens , but then , hey , it serious prosumer camcorder	1
overall , i am quite satisfied usability photo quality canon 710 . this camera upgrade my 3-year-old hp 935 -- old guy still worked fine , but very slow didn't handle low-light situations very well all . i also looking bigger zoom range . after weighing options , i decided 710 way go . pros : - uses standard aa batteries . invaluable when you're go need more juice . also , battery life very good - i'm using same aa rechargables i used over year my old camera , i routinely get 2-4 days usage them before needing recharge . - huge lcd screen doesn't suck power . fast response , too . - digital zoom actually helps ! because camera 7.1 mp image stabilizer , i actually get usable images even full 24x combined zoom . very impressed . - very wide range available settings . you customize almost any aspect this camera , sounds shutter speed flash speed/brightness focus .... - big enough , small enough . it fit my back pocket most time , but it big enough remind me it there before i sit down . - fast processing time . taking 3 or 4 minute video it ready go again less than 5 seconds true novelty me -- my old hp took forever ! fast processor also helps viewing images camera - you scroll through very quickly , also jump image very quickly too . much better than previous canon models even . - memory backup battery . remembers what day it , time it , what image you're -- even if you take regular aa out . very useful . - fast start-up time . it ready take picture right after you turn it , especially if you bypass " welcome " image sound screen . - cool features , like color swap color select . also , there option when camera connected your computer set any image your computer wallpaper just press button camera . camera also allows you use digital zoom while taking video , nice touch . - you change lenses add filters very easily . cons : - i mentioned earlier , one reasons i upgraded hp better luck low-light situations . i've camera now just over month , i still haven't figured out best setting clear , low-light photos -- something very easy older canon models , say , 510 . mentioned , there wide range settings available , which also negative if you don't know quite what you're looking . - no " action " setting . similar above , one setting i miss most other canons action setting . this camera requires you set it manually . - video file sizes . typical 4-minute clip run upwards 200 mb -- making it almost impossible send via email or upload anywhere online . also takes up good chunk 1mb memory card , really quickly . canon would better use mpeg-4 here instead avi . - similarly , video quality doesn't reflect large file size most cases , though sound quality very good . - big lcd great , but very hard see outside sun . it backup optical viewfinder , but using puts your nose up against lcd leaves nice smudge it if you're not careful . - buttons still somewhat confusing after month use , but that relatively minor undoubtedly pass time . - bundled software not offer ability resize your images -- i go back through old hp software if i want take image down 3000 pixels wide 600 ! overall , mentioned , camera huge improvement my old hp , even all those little annoyances , i'm sure camera would perfect fit pretty much any amateur-to-intermediate photog . it no slr , but it getting there . , you certainly can't beat price	-1

i bought this camera more than half year ago . my intention get decent camera images , but then also able use it filming short movies . i'm very pleased its performance . good lighting conditions , colors come out amazing . i really really not expect them so vivid sparkling ! darker conditions , well , it still works fine , not nearly bad i expected some other reviews . photos might grainy or not vivid anymore , but stuff still perfectly suitable show photos people . filming , it terrific . i mean , resolution great ( sth like 848 640 or so ) , better than what one could possibly expect regular camera . quality super awesome , looks very neat computer screen . respect . it pointed out you cannot zoom while filming , but not many cameras out there . oh , it also very small gigantic screen great battery life . great buy	1
installing software piece cake , using it quite matter . basic introductory instructions easy enough but after it seems require phd mathematic astrophysics get round all available toggles , tweaks options . first attempts ? moon came out real nice , but saturn white blob no fine detail . nothing like type pics super-whizzkids proudly display celestron site . go back night school one day you might see my fine efforts published well ( oh - using it classic lx200 good see'ing conditions - sorry celestron !	-1
we canon powershot s50 3 years ago , loved it . so this time when my husband wanted buy digital compact camera , we specifically looked canons . we originally thinking getting sd 700,800 or something like . but after we compared these cameras together store near us . we found out sd900 finest lcd display , more opitions control panel ... so we came back bought it amazon ( our favorite online store ) . we used it our last trip grand cayon , lv , sf etc . this sd900 takes very good pictures , especially good lighting conditions . colors also smooth rich . downside , you may already read others ' reviews , no battery indication , no raw(it ok , my husband doesn't much editiing anyway , it too much ask campact camera offer ) , control panel sensitive ... don't get frustrated if you happened pressed wrong button couldn't figure way out during time shooting . stich great function which comes , but when very bright area , you not see stich alignment very well lcd screen ( i guess it common trouble all digital compact cameras which relay lcd dispay ) . overall , it wonderful camera , we love it . it my husband camera , i uses canon 350d , but i borrow it my husband sometimes because it tiny compares my 10 lbs " moose " it takes very good pictures .	1
i bought these trip costa rica used them every day . they comfortable , easy focus , great choice price . these perfect folks like me who interested casual use travel , concerts , sports , etc	1
i using this camera quite bit am completely happy . it both point shoot , slr features . you take quick shots or get started amiture photography . software easy use , easy set up , it works well my mac . it quality you would expect canon name .	1
product working good clarity fine . but i found next version product ( remote)cost lower than this product .	-1
it wonderful piece equipment . love it . wish they made one larger objects	1
i've it several weeks now it seems like great camera . i am still learning new features . i would highly recommend it	1
yes , i am slow make this review , maybe because i spend great deal time using this camera . only thing i would like changed , rechargable pack . first i burned thru many batteries . i switched rechargables , find i still use great deal power , ( i shoot often flash , ) but now i recharge spent batteries after each session . i use charge 12 aa 3 hour shoot . i use this camera studio work it served me well good number years already	1
really cool digital picture frame , very simple use supports all types memory cards even pen drive	1
most carrying case made either fake leather or some kind neoprene material , this one really different . rigid structure also seem great job protect camera . there also belt loop d-ring feature which great .	1
ok ... i don't know who reviews batteries but this one pretty good .	1
camera great because it small enough slip into your pocket take wherever . i main picture taker our family vacations ge t-t ogethers . we 10x optical , 5 mp kodak camera worked well , it just big bulky , never fit pocket . 10x optical zoom v610 also works well , lenses never protrude camera when i use optical zoom . viewing screen large very clear . menus very easy navigate camera editing tools great . it would also make fine camera beginner . panorama function works very well also . i used it multiple times ease it created great pictures . camera turns quickly time pressing button photo capture quick . i camera month now best thing small size without compromise zoom , picture quality , or functionality . lcd screen take up some more battery than other cameras just because it larger , but don't let stop you getting camera . you able take least 70 or so pictures battery lot more if you conservative . my only small frustration when going skiing , i attempted video my brother coming down slope using 10x optical zoom image stabilizer . it night only lights , camera wouldn't focus him until he close , but may just because low light conditions glare snow . otherwise video worked flawlessly . there even terrific function allows you pause video any time during playback create picture video frame . ( very useful ) my brother bought panasonic lumix� dmc-tz1k , ( very good camera also ) before i got v610 now he wishes he got v610	1
i am totally satisfied product features . me still it better than any available product other company this segment . i ranked this product 4 because it manual dial malfunction very often . if i select album mode it still thinks snapshot mode vice-versa . it out guarantee i'll hv live it . anyway there many products present market this series go like w50 or something like	-1
okay , i am new world stargazing . i purchased this telescope based recommendations here amazon.com . i completely satisfied . i am especially impressed clear , crisp viewing moon . i see few planets , but they course very small through eyepiece . i suggestion anyone who may purchase this telescope . take your time putting it together . read all directions first . pay special attention details concerning collimator . if you don't know what , you need . i almsot made some major mistakes , screwing unscrewing parts needed left alone . if you pay attention all details instructions , you telescope together couple hours well your way enjoying yourself , especially clear nigh t.t he package containing my telescope arrived four days completely intact . i couldn't happier my purchase . i am sure more avid sky-watcher might want little something more , but once-in-a-while gazer , this telescope . see ya next review .	1
i bought one these items december ' 04 adorama . it directions written raised letters canister itself . i just ordered here received second one march ' 07 " new " model no instructions . other than , it looks identical old one , so i assume contents same . here exact words written old one : " hydrosorbent 40 gram silica gel "" when pink , reactivate 3 hours 300f " pink referred little circle center canister . i keep this product my camera ( closed stuff sack ) it seems work advertised - though i guess you just faith it - no easy way prove it ( except maybe extremely humid climes )	-1
i'm no means expert , but i really wanted reasonably priced video camera could produce highest quality picture price . i ton research landed ag-dvc30 after much agonizing over " hd or not hd " well brands features . based all reviews i read , this camera seemed offer most features best video money . i not disappointed . my first outing , i took cam grand canyon sedona . wow ! what incredible color clarity ! i also really love 16x zoom . it smooth powerful . i got great shots colorado river rim grand canyon . i'll agree all reviewers audio not great . it not super sensitive so you lose sound if not quite close subject . if you're interested good audio , i'd suggest optional mic . if you just want great video , awesome color , ease use , this your camera . price ( plus rebate ) you really can't beat it	1
product excellent . however when using motion , whether bike or vehicle , it difficult grip falls off hand . addition , " mode/menu " button accidentally hit or depressed your thumb while motion	-1

this used lieu replacement battery . plus if electrical outlet convienent , like when shooting inside , you never worry running out power . also handy if you mobile auto dc/ac converter . but not overall convienent extra battery . i thought it would also trickle recharge battery , but it doesn't . nikon should add this feature	-1
excellent purchase lives up sony name . my main concern before buying it it would swivel enough i could point my mini-camera straight down take macro photos documents . it this easily , legs don't get way . it small enough chuck my backpack take it all time case i need it , it its own little sturdy fabric carrying bag so it doesn't get tangled up anything else . overall , i would rate it excellent	1
go nikon own website nikonusa.com compare technical specifications this version ' ' version this lens . there only three differences . one ' ' version its aperture set only camera body , while ' ' version its aperture set either body or ring lens . all recent nikon bodies set aperture . ring lens invariably locked all recent camera bodies . second difference one ( 1 ) 13 lens elements version lens made extra low dispersion ( ed ) glass . if dispersion difference so important what deal other 12 elements ? sounds like marketing me . third difference ' ' version costs three times much ' ' version	-1
bought these batteries charger just before going overseas trip . i didn't want bothered frequently changing aa batteries , which seemed last only day or so heavy use . i quite pleased performance these rechargeables . they lasted several days heavy use before needing charged they re-charged only few hours . big bonus i didn't expect : recharger compatible european 240 voltage so i didn't use electric converter !	1
this great camera travel everyday events because its small convenient size . we bought it replace our bulkier sony dsc-f707 . large screen wonderful ! video feature lot fun but due small size it hard take steady video . battery meter very useful it tells you how much time you left . main downside this camera flash . it doesn't work well very dark conditions distant or even slightly distant shots . if it weren't flash , i would given this rating 5 stars . this overall good camera . more serious digital photography , we prefer use sony dsc-f707 it better flash zoom . however , it too bulky carry around	-1
this great bag . it fits camera perfectly room all accessories well . i'm very pleased happy amazon carries item we could not locate it anywhere else	1
panasonic pv-gs500 discontinued late 2006 anticipation panasonic new 2007 models which available spring . pv-gs500 compact , delivers stunning video moderate lighting above , lot features appeal aspiring pro-sumer videographer . it lacks audio output jack , which many fault it . it separate microphone jack . menu driven toggle easy use . it reall aimed casual videographer who wants superb quality compact , uncomplicated package it delivers precisely . low-light performance poor , but there accessory shoe , so you mount auxillary light . i would suggest getting accessory bracket provides two or three accessory shoes so you use both shotgun microphone auxillary light weddings , parties other group events . battery life what you would expect , so carrying one or two spare batteries recommended . all all , very nice 3ccd camcorder advanced amateur or just someone who wants superb image quality easy-to-use package . jerr	1

yep , we love this camera ! amazon got it us just time our trip las vegas we got wonderful footage great still shots our trip . still shots amazing , you really zoom close get great clear shots things our regular digital camera couldn't . fact we tested this proof , we both cameras us . my son got great close up star jones far across gathered crowd , right up her face if he standing right front her , my photo same area so pixilated blurry you can't even tell what subject ! i love we two cameras one , video stills , so we don't carry both . i really like there separate card still photos so low battery power doesn't threaten wipe memory clean . we eventually got longer life battery but one hour just fine our trip . it would nice separate battery charger , but it really didn't get inconvenient , we'd just plug it while we slept we ready day when we woke up . price excellent all features we got . yep , we love this camera	1
this product fits my camera perfectly not all bulky . great safeguard falls velcro latch provides just enough security .	1
i sony battery came camera bought additional sony battery allowed 2-4 hours . however , i wanted battery i could count better part " all day " event i found it qm91d . i asked photograph wedding getting ready ( hair dresser 0830 , until end reception 11:30 pm ) qm91d held strong . i not constantly video tape , but my digital recorder i 6 sony 120 tapes ( 60 min digital ) -- 5 captured using qm91d . i switch some tapes before they completely used make sure i didn't miss important events ... so i never actually used up " all " qm91d battery . this battery used again during evacuation houston ( secondary hurricane rita ) -- i used it entirely it not faulter ... it lasted throughout trip i no need change smaller batteries . size battery not really bother me -- i aware it would larger than others it not hamper use camera . read manufacturer information battery life , charging time etc ... this battery it valid . i would recommend this battery .	1
camera good . it 1 week now . low light it works produces fair results . bright light much better . small light weight . you must use supplied docking station transfer ther no usb port camera . there dc tv out camera ( well docking station ... just no usb ... why ? ) 30gb hard drive plenty ... maybe too much . if you fill this up you looking 8 dvd hours transfer . software weak conflicts roxio 7.5 . roxio became unusable . roxio stinks anyway . found simple program burn after this ... ashampoo . plan getting adobe premier elements , too . amazon best deal ... 89 less 30 mail rebate adobe . much better then software box . my first cam we now cute baby . easy keep it rolling gigs save .	-1

only two drawbacks this lens it requires huge amount light take quality photographs it relatively slow autofocus , especially where there not adequate light . aside this it good but not great lens . it probably worth money it cost , however , i believe better lens would 70 - 300 mm vr which costs 4x price this lens	-1
i've owned p-73 two years now . one thing i'm noticing couple digital cameras amazon reviews , after year or so , camera some kind error or just dies completely . me , this hasn't happened this camera . it always great , it lot really convenient features . when i bought this camera , i knew nothing cameras . i just wanted one really bad some reason one day went out bought this one because it pretty . i got really lucky -- i mean , i only bought it because it pretty -- i knew nothing it . but , nonetheless , i got lucky bought this camera takes aa batteries , came battery charger its own usb cord . it ton settings it . now i understand more photography , i really like manual setting -- slowest shutter speed 30 seconds compared 10-15 seconds even newer cameras its class . like i said , i never any problems it . batteries always lasted long ; took little time recharge . i never even bought memory card this camera -- i use lowest resolution take pictures because that all given memory card hold , my pictures still decent quality . i'm now looking into new camera because i want excellent image quality , , ironically , ever since i've shopping new digital camera , my sony overexposing underexposing 20 percent shots i take ; weird . anyway , if you're looking buy sony digital camera , based my experience this one , i'd recommend brand	-1
this why sony hot ! this sexy little ( yes its really small size pack cards ) it takes perfect clear crisp pictures battery life long 320mins perfect vacation , make sure get memory stick it though , because w/o it it only holds 15 pics . this my first digital camera i would definitely buy sony again	1
5 stars ... easy use . screen large clear . automatic settings include variety scene selections ( ie beach , party , fireworks scenes ) . i yet use video , so i cannot comment . i think this great all-around camera , it fits smallest purses ... big plus . screen yet get scratched all my purse juggling . my only complaint would shipping . i paid extra expedite my order since i leaving country few days later . it sent via ups signature " person " required . when i missed ups first time , i unable just sign paper leave it my door . i contact ups find out when they would return so i could sign person , which ordeal . i wish i would've known camera sent this way . i would've requested no signature required .	1
just gone back using film camera digital ( my wife still uses digital ) i found this excellant camera so far . i taken 6 rolls film everyone one came out perfect . i would recommend it	1
i got nikon laser rangefinder chrisymas it 8x magnification . i found this powerful golf . i could not hold it steady flag . 6x magnification bushnell yardage pro scout much better . also it very compact stores easily my golf cart . price amazon well below i could find anywhere else .	1
i bought this camera something bit more capable , but not expensive slr . zoom equivalent 300 mm lens slr , i certainly saved myself heap money over buying slr setup same capacities . i use this camera mostly manual . my aim buying it - get more proficient using manual settings . few times i switched it auto , haven't all impressed . autofocus seems little unpredictable , but there single press manual focus button left side , well focusing ring , these me very well indeed . i don't think i would recommend this camera someone who wanted use it mostly point shoot . it loses one star mostly because its poor macro capability . really really good closeups it just doesn't come close my konica minolta dimage z6 . i bit lost without image stabilization first . this camera compensates not this jacking up film speed when auto , if i want use it manual handhold , course i same . since i use tripod lot , this not too much issue me . i've heard lot bad press graininess higher iso , but i found them least good film if not better . colors great . i love my range menu options , though there nothing too extraordinary them . this camera more buttons than some , but once i got used them , they make my selections so much faster when i am shooting changing light conditions . i like fact i use cable release this camera . i used it quite bit low light work , fact i dial it right down twenty second shutter speed or even fantastic . i've found it pretty hard find image editing software work directly raw images this camera . it working really well me prosumer camera . however , i still think if i could go back , i might go panasonic dmc-fz50 10.1 mp instead . maybe . i would check one out more thorougly first	-1

this well made head constructed solid metal nice finish . there no plastic parts even rubber piece quick release plate hard rubber . i used it every week two years no problems it . i use it mainly attached monopod sports photography videography . quick release clever locking mechanism prevent accidental release . i bought extra quick release plate so i switch two cameras . tilt only -- no swivel : amazon ( others including bogen ) calls it swivel tilt head , but seems imply it moves two directions -- tilting ( up down ) swivelling ( side side or panning ) . this head only moves tilting direction which allows you orient camera either landscape or portrait modes . tilting action could improved if head clicked into upright position when you tilt it back landscape . when you going portrait mode , there no problem since it stops 90 degrees . however , when i want go back landscape , i hold it out look it see if it level . subtle click know i'm there would nice	1
i am really enthusiastic this lens because it excellent accessory my camera very convenient price . i add it use it landscapes , mountain views , nature images such , also group pictures family photos . it what supposed : it increases field view while keeping whole image very clear , this way pictures appear more natural -- whole view not narrow frame -- perspective deepness also , quite similar it seems me what i see my own eyes . very useful additional tool	1
i not yet used fz30 or fz50 , but i think this thing beats pants off fz5 or fz10 far image quality concerned . really nice camera . nice dslr type feel . 71% people check out fz20 here actually end up buying fz7 , ( today ) but i not believe iq fz7 could hold candle fz20 . buyers may * more megapixel * bandwagon . you lot 5 megapixels . i found iq fz20 very close dslr	1

i got pair these christmas . initially , i skeptical quality inexpensive roof-prism optic , this isn't my favorite brand name either . but contrary my expectations , i've extremely impressed them so far . good brightness , contrast , sharpness , field view , close focus all exceeded my expectations binocular this price point . feel , fit finish all very good . i wear eyeglasses , these binoculars still deliver nice wide view through eyepiece . twist-down eyecups quick extend / retract if you sharing these someone who doesn't wear glasses . they come decent carry case , relative porro-prism types , weight compactness both little bit better . if you looking good binocular birding or general use , i highly recommend you take look through these addition other popular models . i think these really hit sweet spot price / size / weight / performance , i'm very happy them	1

nikon always leader photography/ camera/ lenses . others nobly tried but nikon remains high bar others only hope reach . when shift film digital began , there some speculation if nikon could keep up competition . well , rest assure not only they kept up , they continue lead way . latest example this d200 . like d70/ d80 - this solid piece equipment . just feel it tells you you holding excellent piece technology . but proof always end results again , combination nikon know-how nikon lenses lead even beginner come up excellent pictures . gone " lag shots " . you fire up shoot multiple pictures seconds so action shots all yours . without even " tweaking " picture computer program , you print top line photos home . people cited cons : expensive . yes . camera come hefty price tag but it should kept mind this piece machinery intended serious photographers . if you " vacation holiday " picture taker , then you should elect buy cheaper camera . same true difficulty multitude small buttons , dials switches . there too many they overwhelming but only someone who " point shoot " school picture taking . anyone else relish options nikon provided us d200 . room improvement ? well , battery life nowhere near good d70 which i upgraded but weak complaint you still get hundreds shots one charge . also , it would boon if flash would automatically pop up when needed like former models . so if you serious photography always one ready , this one you	1

i've using 35mm slr cameras over 30 years . last 9 or 10 years i gone through several under $400 digital cameras technology improved . this kodak z710 very economical compromise . built-in 10x optical zoom great feature . z710 not image stabilization ( is)as some more expensive models but if you moderately steady hand you press shutter button rather than pound it ( whole camera ! ) that not really problem . feature this camera i really appreciate manual settings position which allows much more creative control shot . check out kodak web site more information this . i bought this camera amazon dealer less than $200 shipped me . that cheaper than reconditioned unit ( same model ! ) recently sold ebay	1

this rangefinder great ! much lighter than big bulky other units . all great features needed . this one you take you not leave truck because it too big . i tested this against some my buddies ' bigger units known distances this one out bigger units speed accuracy . great scan mode . best buy . should sold ($) more than asked	1
charger really what it supposed . i li-10b , so i still some what worried it wasn't going job , but it . i also liked it small so you travel it anywhere .	1
this really nice compact camera canon . picture quality excellent . i tried some night/day shots pictures great . zoom pretty much non existant 3x however depends what you use camera . build quality excellent i really love 3 " display . i find ipod like controls very convenient too though it takes some practice get used it . camera very compact but i never problems get good grip steady hand . images excellent true color indeed sharp . i would definetely recommend accessory kit this camera which includes nice small leather case extra original canon battery its available amazon . accessory kit turns out cheaper than buying individual components its contains original canon parts especially extra battery . also get sd card large enough memory . what comes camera ( 32mb ) really waste . still don't understand why these camera manufactures throw such small memory card . but overall great easy use smart looking camera produces wonderful results	1

sony cybershot great camera . colors features amazing . very easy use . only thing i dont like camera zoom out button . if you zoomed you wont able zoom out .	-1
we bought this camera because our other digital camera ( sony dsc-h1 ) too large carry around lot time . we took it skiing us ( whistler , bc ) it took some outstanding pictures , both persons landscape/scenery . it small enough you pretty much carry it anywhere , anytime . others may disagree , but touchscreen menu controls easy use fairly intuitive . fingerprints get screen but you hardly notice them they easily removed ( or better yet , use little wand they give you camera instead your fingers , doesn't leave any marks screen ) . summarize : this excellent camera , very small size but large 3 " led display , takes excellent pictures , touchscreen menu easy use intuitive . most people very happy this camera if they buy it . only negative thing this camera not view finder , but unless you very bright sun your back this isn't too much problem .	1
i've purchased other bags but this one beats all it great price	1
i bough this waterproof case trip st. thomas over christmas . photographs we took came out perfect . flash diffuser worked well , eliminating air bubbles normally captured underwater cameras . make sure you set up your camera underwater mode so it automaticlaly adjusts your color balance . only problem i since it so compact , i often accidently would move switch movie mode . this ruined few photographs , but also made great movie sea turtle coming up air . i know it expensive , but much cheaper than buying new camera or buying multiple disposable underwater cameras x-ray machines fog up pictures	1
i dropped camera 2 feet metal outer rim lens slightly became bent won't close . after some time spent tring bend metal back place , i finally able close lens . besides , it awesome camera . i am able pick out color ( ex . red ) take picture color standing out everything else black white . no photoshop needed	-1

like others i compared it scuba diving trip kodak max sport this one few advantages : 1 . film winded greater depth . 2 . pictures came out clearer - not grainy better colors . don't expect too much it depths below 8 meters since light won't enough ( i used it bright summer day red sea ) . even shallower depths colors turn blue/green without use flash . i taken it down depth 35 meters camera fine , but wouldn't take pictures depths below 20 meters . pictures i took shallow depth came out excellent	-1

good product , like price . this much less expensive than current pinseeker 1500 models , i bought it ebay used $150 so you may able find it less ( look under hunting golf rangefinders this model ) . this not pinseeker feature newer models but normal mode scan mode work perfectly ranging flags no reflectors ( although you may need try more than one time relatively stable hands ) . i able range flag 270 yards , able range top telephone pole 375 yards ( but it windy so flag straight out little cloudy ) . i would estimate this work ranging flags calm sunny day ( these don't work well sunny day because laser used visible light laser gets little interference sunlight ) 215-230 yards flag ( which what i need it ) . less expensive alternative than pinseeker , i really like performance , very impressed .	-1
i bought this camera my 80 year old mother because i knew if she going try digital photography , it easy ! printer dock simple her use transfer snapshots her cat her computer email them her friends . i used older cx-7300 , ( very similar camera ) backpacking years it never failed under harsh conditions . lack optical zoom plus me ; less break . c530 more compact , better resolution , still option using aa batteries when rechargables die . if you want simple digital snapshots , you love this little camera	1

camera short time grown love its features capabilities . purchase 50 mm-200mm telephoto zoom lens ; price it nice lens . i tried image stabilizer shooting picture air conditioner my neighbor roof using 200 mm telephoto . when you enlarge image you read label brand name ! without image stabilizer , it blur . i same book 100 ft away using 200 mm setting . without image stabilizer title blurred ; image stabilizer it sharp . very nice feature you take image then enlarge portion it save , or use filters make them bw , soft , more bright , or different color tones . people report under tungsten light auto setting gives yellow tone without flash . this true . however , you use mode , which like auto mode , reset white balance easily tungsten light picture comes out nice !. great low light capabilities image stabilizer . if you into action photography , this may not camera you . it limited ability store sequence photos without delay . other camers react faster larger capacity . reset default bright natural tone . you this some modes , but not all . read manual , it really empower you many nice capabilities . newer lenses light small interface image stabilization system automatically	1
i'd love read review anyone who purchased this camera , aiptek zoom dv-6 mp image stabilizing camcorder w/3x optical zoom . i see claim it 3x optical zoom cannot help but question this because i am unable find this product aiptek-dot-com this cam supposedly available since july 30th , 2006 . am wondering what gives ? please someone , post review this model hopefully , some picture results too . let us know this 3x optical zoom , please ! i pick rating , so four star rating based mpvr version this camera -- which i own find very decent gadget . mine over year old still going strong - no problems model . mp3 sound terrific . i convert movies viewing camera while go ... " wow " its quality . i recorded sounds more . very decent ! just drag drop my files my pc sd card i switch out movies mp3 . i am happy model , but it not any optical zoom - just digital . still get pretty good pix tho , just use various settings ... my little homemade movies good , very decent , but without additional lighting , indoor movies dark . this camera doesnt handle well strong sun - i use umbrella over my cam i film . big diff . so , this newer model really all much better ? can't wait know ! 3x optical sounds good ..	-1

multi-element add-on lense used kodak dx-7590 provides good wide-angle capability . note this very large add-on lense ( screws into dx-7590 extension-piece which costs additional $20 ) . job well most portraiture scenic applications , however two caveats :( 1 ) slight curvature field extreme corners wide-angle shots ( ie , corners shots may noticeably out focus ) . suggest cropping 95% original picture maintain sharpness across plane . ( 2 ) size lense render pop-up flash outside lense focusing system ( ultra-sonic ) less functional .	-1

i don't think anybody going pretend little casio exilim ex-z600 6.0 mega pixel camera best camera ever built or takes best pictures world . but under $[ ... ] , it hard beat everything advertised . size perfect , one smallest , slimmest cameras made , easily fitting into one [ ... ] pocket , even when enclosed small case . viewing screen probably biggest brightest you'll find , so aiming shooting easy it . range modifications ( size , contrast , sharpness , saturation , etc . ) taking managing pictures seems almost endless , yet various menus camera offers simple navigate . camera docking stand makes downloading pictures one computer well charging up camera snap . moreover , according casio , single charge afford one up 500 or more snaps . picture quality ? it perhaps not absolutely clear well defined , even its maximum six mega pixels , best cameras ; although , fair , best cameras often cost three-to-four times much this one . so , far i'm concerned , i've no complaints , pictures i've taking delight eye . z600 makes picture-taking fun again	1

celestron tool easy carry , easy use , ( least my case ! ) gives me quick , precision collimation my newtonian . why pay laser collimator ( which needs calibrated ) when you use this ? collimation most important part your setup ; without good mirror alignment , all you'll see blobs blurs even best viewing nights . this combination tool makes aligning both primary secondary mirrors fairly painless , also fairly fast . highly recommended any level observer	1
i'm pleased purchase . i bought this camera just under two years ago when i getting ready trip abroad . i spent six months england , five weeks travelling around europe this camera its case my belt . it very sturdy if nothing else , trains , planes , hostels , general bustle i'm very pleased how well it held up . nothing it broke . i probably took least 400 pictures during my trip , if not more . sure i've swap out batteries one or two occasions two years i've it , but my general feeling batteries holding up quite well . zoom this camera very nice . it one better zooms i've seen simple camera this type , or least it back when i bought it . it also several features older film cameras not , such timer you set before running get your own picture , or settings take " portraits " or " night shots . " i know this camera cannot compare professional cameras , i know it doesn't all frills new digital cameras , i am not trying compare it those . i'm not professional photographer , so i don't know how use camera exchangable lenses whatnot . i don't want digital personal professional reasons . traditional film camera , this one best i've ever used . bottom line : good quality photos , sturdy build , excellent zoom lens , useful easy use features , long battery life make this camera excellent choice if you want traditional film camera few perks	1

after springing cybershot august so i could compact camera i would actually take places , i've very , very pleased . last camera i older sony dsc quite bulky , ran batteries , shutter problems -- but it took great quality pictures interface features perfect , so i thought i would go dsct5 , since it avoids all those problems . only tiny battery charge , no sticky shutter ... it sexy hell . screen huge very bright . i hate taking pictures flash general , i find flash makes nasty redeye more often than not this camera . ( camera gives you impression you cant change shutter speed or anything ) however ! you easily change this going into over/under exposure options under exposing your photos when you dark environments . they come out surprisingly well blur-free	1
casio exilim ex-s770rd great camera price . camera smallest market fit any pocket . lcd sreen large very clear . 7.2 mp produces great picture quality functions easily accessed . this my first casio purchase , i am very pleased quality	-1
great camera . . . one few lower priced cams keep mic jack headphone jack , but beware . .. . this camera not come lens cap , no remote control . other sources state this camera not leica lens . this camera not a/v input . no flash , no hot accessory shoe ( though it one which no power ) . no widescreen lcd . it record widescreen but no image stabilization widescreen .	1
i checked 3ccd panasonic canon camcorders . price range this best i found ( if you extra money , new hdv camcorder sony might your best bet ! ) . important : ccd issues referred other user comments real ( although i don't know if it also apply this new model ) . it actually happened my previous sony . i purchased 5 years warranty sony my dcr-hc90 . 5 years good product life so i take risk ccd failure after period enjoy this great product until then ! great features : small but feels solid , 3 megapixel pictures ( impressive quality camcorder ) , incredible low light performance , nice touch screen , great features . battery life actually not too bad original battery but you might need extra . what i not like : cannot take full size pictures camera mode ( only memory mode ) , limited zoom compared most new camcorders lots required extra ( svideo cable , ilink cable , video light , decent size memory stick , extended warranty ) . i am still giving this 5-stars overall .	1
optical x6 zoom canon a710 already better than cameras it range ( i.e. non slr ) . however , zoom takes picture up natural size ; tele converter lens really make difference . firstly , if there any negatives , they very minor ; lens adapter black - would nice silver match camera . erm , that it ! main quality canon lens , which they always well . clarity this lens very good , very little fuzziness edge . it also connects simply adapter seems fairly solid when connected . electronics features help overall control adding attachment . tele lens make difference just getting bit closer get what you want .	1
after reading reviews here [ ... ] this baby , i little cocerned its low-light indoor performance . let me first say my fears largely unfounded . yes , if you film very low light , it darken many colors . but we're talking 60 lux , which roughly equivalent light put off candles birthday cake . just keep lights when your kid blows out candles , viola ! seriously , i absolutely no problems it filming too dark indoors , outdoors , or even when i film local bands playing dark bars . reason i wanted try this camera because it only flash-based camera receiving even mildly positive reviews . i not want tape mechanism break , nor fragile hard drive cannot used many film-worthy conditions ( think snow skiing , drive mechanism freeze up you very cold weather ) . i said , i skeptical when i purchased it , but no more . videos far better than any other camcorder i've owned . my last canon zr 50 mini dv , this camera takes vastly superior videos than one . four stars only because mpeg2 format this records . i mac , so editting requires i convert dv streamclip so imovie import movies . mainly , i just don't edit my home videos so hasn't problem . but if would nice it easier option , it could if they encoded mpeg4 h264 mp3/aac , which appears next standard . if concerns you , or if you want hd , you might wait until panasonic sd1 available because it records avhdc which form mpeg4 . course , imovie doesn't yet support either , so you may wait until ilife 07 really use it . parting , i also mention size this unit absolutely fabulous . i no longer dread lugging around even my smallish mini dv camera . this thing literally fits my jacket pocket , so i end up filming lot more than i previous cameras . if you're looking small , flash-based , good quality video , get this camera , you'll love it	-1
i've waiting this technology years . so when i found out jvc planning coming out their 4 gb microdrive version , i one . $1500 price tag too much though . then i found out gz-mg50 coming out , would $1000 . i thought it still little pricey , but i couldn't wait any longer . so far , camera performed great . it easy use easy transfer files my computer then dvd . however , video editing software came it seems bit cheap , but it gets job . maybe next gen version improvemen t.t he movie quality very good . i won't give it " great " because i occasionally see pixel blurring when watching my burned dvds . don't bother taking pictures this , unless you only plan emailing them . quality far too low use capture those precious moments . i recommend getting additional battery ( three hour model ) . one hour battery just doesn't cut it , especially if you want review your scenes while you're out shooting . if jvc gave camcorder larger ccd included better software , i would given this 5 star rating , otherwise i think they right track , few years , minidv may forgotten eigh t-t rack .	-1
good camera $129 i paid . everything pretty well , your picture modes pretty customizable . only qualm it takes second or two longer than i wish when camera saves/loads pictures memory card . might problem when trying shoot consecutive pictures -- but probably wouldn't doing it this type camera anyways .	-1

good quality , particularly amazing price . sturdy , well-made , even case nice . pops open second , collapses just easily . keep mind fully collapsed it wider than standard backpack , so if you lash it under backpack it awkward . but strap carrying case makes it easy loop monopod carry it vertically	1
this my second " " lens other 70-200l f4 both exceptional . if you looking professional results you need good equipment used within it limits .	1
i am thrilled this lens capabilities pictures it . i test shot corner window determine if it would good my insect shots i like so well . i bought this add-on converter am thrilled added this 50mm lens these necessary items my set-up . i like nature photography best like use my off summer days hiking finding photographs take perhaps well-known places but finding unique angles subjects what i like specialize . this lens greatly enhance your experience ' little world ' we commonly trod over or weed-ate away . i built diffuser using ping-pong ball over flash so lighting would work better . ( works great , btw ) . usual , it great canon glass trick .	1
i picked up 5d march 28-135 . worked 3 months felt something missing . i went bit bullet , got 24-105 what amazing difference it made . color = vivid , clarity = sharp , good walk-around lens . after 4 months , i not one bad thing say this lens . my suggestion , if you looking lens , would this one	1
i own several canon lens my 20d this hands down best . i 28-135 which very good lens regardless some reviews , i got many excellent photos it - this distinctly better all ways . ( course , it costs lot more ) . recently went grandchildred sea world i got 100% good photos , several really outstanding ones . it light , accurate - what more you want ? you replace slew lens this one perhaps selling old ones help pay it . bought it soon it available not regretted it one moment . if you one lens , this one	1
despite reading glowing reviews this lens , i still surprised see how well it performed . lens so sharp you get very good cropped pictures running athletes , distance three quarters football field away , shooting hand held , late afternoon light , which print 5x7 still look like pro took them ! if you want tack sharp lens indoor sports pictures can't afford , or otherwise not want long lens outdoor sports pictures , then you should give this lens your serious consideration .	1
if you don't want get hooked canon series lens , not buy this one . i made mistake buying one now all i want canon lens . it super sharp , contrast saturation fantastic . no need retouch any your photos . so far , i've used it candid shots my kids dance gigs . f/ 2.0 helps lot get right shutter speed freeze action . very good buy . i got mine here amazon	1
all reviews this lens all true . it great lens . i love quality it . however , if you like take door photoes don't very big rooms , you might want consider 50mm f/ 1.4 . i mostly find my self backed up corner trying take picture home	-1
answer most likely yes ; since its price make it best value fast canon prime lens . but before you make $350 plunge here few useful things know how it used . keep mind i use this lens rebel xt ( 1.6 factor ) , which means it provides me angel view similar 135mm film cameras . sharpness : yes that one feature you count when buying this lens . this lens produces very sharp pictures . so much so it blow away your 18-55 kit lens ( if you one ) all other zoom lenses . exception l-series zooms . sharpness difference obvious even smallest prints ( 4 6 ) . if you can't envision such difference then consider this . sharpness viewed contrast edges different color objects . hence , sharper image greater contrast edges such groups color . this lens captures contrast such setting better than most other lenses . speed : this lens blazingly fast . such you opportunity shoot higher shutter speeds wide open ( remember inverse relation aperture shutter speed ) . more importantly you gain ability shoot low light situations ( concert example ) still maintain decent shutter speed handholding . here best part , if you're like most new people photography , you probably plan take self portraits . this lens give you ability , you able buy few clamp lights coupled 100-150w bulbs start shooting medium iso speeds wide open . angel view : assuming you using this lens 1.6 digital format consider you tight crop , more like 135mm lens film camera ( 1.6 *85 = 136 ) . what translate practical terms ? you stand 6-8 feet away your subject able cover their head shoulders landscape orientation . special effects : here two special effects you find useful this lens depth field compression . some degree or every lens offers depth field , which summarize only subject interest focus rest picture blurred . this lens unique it creates very shallow depth field which subject truly isolated whole scene . set aperture 1.8 focus correctly you achieve such results . more importantly lens quality such blur ( known bokeh ) outstanding there eight diaphragm blades control aperture opening vs . 5 or 6 many other lenses . compression , since camera telephoto it compress everything its sight closer together fit its sight . example , if you photographing person , their face look wider their nose look smaller or flatter . keep mind unlike some longer telephoto lenses ( 300mm example ) effect this lens subtle pleasant size build : its size weight perfect ! it balances my xt very nicely . so much so , i take pictures very low shutter speeds this combination ( though i don't find my self doing often this fast lens ) . all this translates comfort confidence when i am shooting this lens . build quality excellent , i find no inherit weakness design . if you plan photograph friends family then this lens . you take sharp pictures right kind effects portraits like compression beautiful bokeh . lens fast designed excellently maximum control comfort . you won't miss shot because shake slow shutter speeds even if you ( that big if ) you put its speed use dialing higher aperture . it only draw back it pretty tight angel view 1.6 factor slrs . i can't think any other prime non-l canon line up matches this lens ( other than possibly 50mm 1.4 ) . truly incredible value , buy it confidence ! ps . no means this review cover all merits this lens . name couple , lens offers precise auto focus low chromatic aberration . rather , i covered features most useful its intended purpose ; taking pictures people .	1
i bought this keep dust iraq out my canon ef-s 17-85 lens . it fine job i've seen no noticeable change quality images i'm capturing my canon 20d	1
hoods offer several benefits photographer . primarily hood shades lens stray light may result unwanted discoloration or hazing image , or appearance lens flare . shading your lens helps improve contrast image quality . hood not required eliminate these problems , any item used shade lens provide same protection stray light . hood convenient it built offer protection while ensuring it not inadvertently find its way into your image . photographers often state protective abilities hood reason one . this hood solid conical three three quarters inch long offers some protection keeping moisture wind blown debris off lens element . there nothing more irritating than reviewing your images find dust spots or other flaws . when place , hood protect lens impacting solid objects . replacing damaged hood usually cheaper than repairing expensive lens . this hood manufactured canon 100-400mm f/ 4.5 - 5.6 ef lens normally comes included lens when sold new . there no need buy one lens amazon often suggests . since hood wider than lens ; it easily stored attached reverse position . this doesn't add length lens , but make it wider inch . inch may not seem like lot , but tightly packed camera bag , it huge . fortunately canon provides storage case lens used addition your camera bag . while protective benefits exist , they secondary limited . i find impact hood my image quality more convincing reason use hood . considering impact image quality low cost compared my other camera equipment ( except lens case ) , purchasing hood money well spent . pros : improves contrast image qualityoffers limited protection lens cons : takes up more space your camera bag store len	-1
since there tons rave reviews features this camera , i won't bother you details . instead , i tell you one huge letdown this camera likes ( rebel , 20d ): 1.6 focal length factor . this means my dear 28-105 lens now sorry 45-170 . recoup loss i'd spend $700 17-40 4.0 lens . this consequence using small ccd . cameras like 1d full-size 35mm ccd sell over $ 4,000 . i cannot wait price go down . i also cannot help wonder whether focal reading speedlite flashes correct ( i own 540ez discovered dismay it doesn't work these cameras ) . i look my a2 ( still infatuated it ) i wonder if i right thing . i think i keep it around while , just case ..	-1
i've my remote switch almost 3 months now . i love it . so far only feature i used remote switch it works flawlessly . if you want trip shutter distance without shaking 20d ( camera i use ) this what you need . i use it extension cord since i am generally 30 feet away camera . i am very pleased this purchase . no complaints this point	1
ability combine four different delay interval modes makes this product able accommodate almost any automatic-shooting situation . you control delay until sequence starts , delay shots , total shooting time , number shots . last one , however , where glaring flaw comes : controller limited 99 shots when you use total-number-of-shots setting . correspondence i've canon , they no explanation this asinine limitation . even modest cf card these days holds more than 99 shots , even raw mode . time lapse , 99 shots woefully inadequate . you work around this defect simply letting your card fill up or doing math using total-duration setting . but sometimes you want shoot multiple sequences one card . if you know you want 300 frames ( example ) , it annoying baby-sit camera stop it manually , or math figure out how many seconds total your sequence take , convert minutes seconds , then dial into setting controller . if you then decide use different interval , you get re-do all . dumb , canon . fact , this device shouldn't necessary anyway . every camera today should come this functionality ; it technically trivial , since every one these digital slrs computer plenty on-board timers logic this task	-1
i never take my uv filter off my lens unless i am going immediately put different filter . there basically two camps out there , those feel you should always use uv filter protect your lens dirt scratches those feel it waste time only degrades your image . well , i tried going without one awhile then dirt started build up front element my very expense lens . although you clean front element lens , i feel much , much safer wiping my comparatively cheap uv filter time time again rather than chancing any actual lens damage . i think nearly unquantifiable loss image quality you may suffer uv filter , it well worth extra piece mind it gives me	-1
i hesitated year upgrade 550 580 because , paper , i not see much advantage . fact , 580 worthwhile upgrade . i like new dial back adjusting exposure compensation , etc . catchlight screen nice touch but biggest advantages incredibly fast recycling time smailler size . i machine gun my 1ds2 this flash keeps up . 550 could not . it small enough not overwhelm my little rebel too . i note there some vignetting 24mm direct flash unless i drop wide lens screen . manual says ths not happen but it . not big deal since i use gary fong diffuser or bounce flash almost always	1

i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
i am not most experienced photographer , but this camera takes terrific pictures , my opinion . nice big lcd screen touch screen great feature	1

when digital cameras first came out , i , like many people swore i'd always loyal film . digital could never take place film . i'm not convinced it replaced film completely . there still something i love putting roll film camera , shooting away , sending film processed , seeing results . i also know it bit expensive . i know argument quality always paramount discussion , but digital cameras improving this regard , most manufacturers assuring users while technology always improving , we point where good investment made digital slr it not outdated soon buyer purchases camera . so i figured now time get digital slr . i loyal nikon user nearly ten years , owned nikon n60 , n70 , n80 . my first love , still n70 ( i've told person who sold me camera he thought i only person who loved n70 ) . i purchased n80 only after my n70 cost too much repair , but i've enjoyed way my various nikon cameras handled all sorts situations fact they simple use point shoot if i don't time use specific controls , but it also options more creative artistic purposes . my nikon cameras allowed me capture family moments ease majestic landscapes , wildlife shots all sorts other things i can't resist capture forever . i decided purchase d70 since it close what i've already experienced nikon . many ways it works similar way n70 80 , except it digital rather than film version . like film versions midrange nikon slr , it dial allows automatic setting , portrait , landscape , sports , close-up , nightscape , night portrait modes , ability select aperture , shutter speed or manual controls . camera auto manual focus abilities . photos easy or technical photographer desires . controls easy use , though it takes practice comfortable . personal level , camera passed halloween test , niece birthday test , fall foliage new england test favorite scenic spots test . only real difficulty i've camera trying capture stained glass windows dark setting . auto focus not worked all i'm not thrilled manual focus these shots , but this point i'm sure it photographer not camera . i one suggestion anyone who purchases this camera . manual very confusing . it uses all sorts symbols more distraction than anything else . i've luck " magic lantern guides " my other cameras , but not yet used it this camera . i purchase nikon d70 field guide ( david busch , wiley publishing ) which helpful . it quick reference anyone already familiar nikon photography general but it also provides introduction novice photography .	1
d70s minor update original d70 introduced 2004 , few new features slightly larger lcd . it still great camera , but expect it replaced new d80 , which 40 percent more pixels , 2.5 -inch lcd , additional useful features old price d70s . so , you probably save little money still purchase sophisticated digital slr if you wait until prices d70s stabilize new , lower level . , say , $600 , this camera would incredible bargain . d70s shined one best cameras its class since its introduction . example , it 1/500th second flash synch speed ( found no other camera but d50 ) so you keep ambient light under control avoid ghost images . its autofocus fast accurate , features both single-autofocus , continuous-autofocus ( tracking action ) , novel " automatic " autofocus mode switches af-s af-c required . if you no nikon lenses , get this camera 18-70mm kit lens , which very sharp versatile , rather than more limited 18-55 lens . you won't regret it	1
i owned this camera two months now taken 100 photographs ( keepers ) date . because i involved photography almost 35 years , i developed certain prejudices . particular , i never comfortable auto exposure even less comfortable auto focus . fact , last auto focus camera i owned nikon n8008s i ultimately sold auction because i could not adapt using various auto settings . however , i like this camera . why ? d70s very easy camera use i only refer manual check couple settings look up some features . honestly , set up takes only few minutes handling not terribly different film camera . i should point out this camera really designed auto focus lenses if you choose use your manual focus lot , you disable many camera features . because i am both stubborn cheap ( but mostly only when it comes spending money myself ) i am using my manual focus lenses this camera . it true i not get any internal exposure meter readings must rely handheld gossen or sunny 16 rule ( quite effective , really ) exposure determination . lcd preview screen thus critical determining or adjusting exposure . i should also point out depth field preview feature also lost when using manual focus lenses . i stunned when i could not stop my lens down burrowed through manual find out what i doing wrong -- which nothing except i using wrong type lens . while i really miss this feature , i am not sure how big loss it really because viewfinder . others made mention low magnification tunnel like views through finder i attest this fact . i compared finder views my trusty old fm just stunned how poorly d70 compared . ultimately best camera camera you use d70 become my camera choice . even though i am using this camera like vintage series leica -- i.e. , handheld meter presetting exposure anticipation photograph -- i find i live this level usability . some point i probably buy auto focus lens ( maybe 35 f2 ) make full use feature set . but now i content using camera old fashioned way	-1
i love new digital canon . only problem it not nearly tough it film twin . i camera less than month when pop-up flash quit working . canon people great , very helpful , but i'd rather not send brand new camera back factory . photos , however , wonderful . film quality most part - printable enlargable . ( it would probably better use camera tripod when using 300mm telephoto but i hike it , so just remember steady it before taking wildlife photos .	-1
i am severe novice photography not know much subject but i really wanted take better pictures my boyfreind who freetstyle motocross . i hard time getting timing down getting good zoom my old camera this camera i getting some amazing pictures . first when reading manual i became extremely overwhelmed scared i made bad decision . i still not know what fancy functions how use them . but i find it very user friendly if you just go automatic shooting modes . i'm very excited wonderful picture quality i've getting . some his sponsors even using my shots their advertisements ! i highly recommend this camera !!	1
i bought remote control so i could trip shutter while my camera tripod . mostly landscape stuff . it works great my intended use . only minor problem you point remote control front camera . i found it works fine if i hold remote front , below lens ( out view lens )	-1
i am just hobbyist . this big purchase big step me get into this level camera . i still haven't mastered using it yet , i've it few months . it wonderful job taking pictures . if you right lenses , it take some most beautiful pictures you've ever seen . again , i'm just hobbyist/enthusiast . i use it take pictures work , too . i highly recommend getting couple very good lenses go it . don't go cheap lenses canon , tamron , sigma , etc . make this camera . yourself favor get nice zoom - spend some bucks . you'll happy you . camera itself pretty easy use if you leave it auto , but that like buying race car never shifting out first gear . auto settings great , they wonderful job , but you so much more if you learn use camera manual , av , tv , or mode . it allows you so much more creativity you'll amazed difference . 30d came out right before i bought 20d , i would probably buy it price now , but i'm very happy my 20d	1
i bought this camera 2 months before my son born . i knew little digital slrs , but after research i found this one me . this camera well constructed durable . pictures excellent . i blown few my pictures up 11x17 without any problem . also , if you going doing any editing photos your computer , this camera would great . i would recommend purchasing newest version photoshop or photoshop elements ( when i bought mine it only came elements 2.0 3.0 already market ) . also , if you want your pictures turn out , you must purchase larger flash . onboard flash weak , leave shadows it not allow you any type " bounce " flash . whole , this best camera i ever my life it would great anyone who previous experience slr cameras .	1
this really handy lens your bag . i added this lens my collection several months ago , i haven't regretted it one bit . i took trip montana august used this lens photograph ton wildflowers . i also using 70-300mm telephoto lens 24-70mm wide angle lens heavily , but most my favorite shots trip taken this lens . autofocusing very quiet since it usm powered , but it often tricky get right focus if you're doing extreme closeup . this general facet macro lenses , so you'll probably find yourself using manual focus 90% time or more . manual focus this lens quite excellent though , responds well fine adjustments . it also quite easy me handhold it , long i decent amount light or pop up flash . all said , this nice lens grab after you decent telephoto lens , if you like photographing small things . otherwise , you might look into getting some other lenses first , i.e. wide angle , fisheye , etc . ( unless you already own all them :-))	1
i wanted get macro lens everyone told me this one get ... i'm so glad i . smaller sensor my 30d , 100mm more like 150mm or so , so it nice , wide-open telephoto/portrait lens well . i've uploaded few photos i've taken w/ this lens show what it capable macro telephoto . i thought 17mm-85mm usm lens came e/ my camera sharp - but compared this lens , kit lens might well diy pinhole camera . my less than perfect rating there no image stabilization available macro lenses . when i'm trying hone bees pollenating flower , there lot shake . i can't practically use tripod when insects bouncing bud bud , so i take 100 shots get one that not shake blur - i miss some really cool shots . addition lack image stabilization , i am frustrated w/ sometimes unpredictable focusing happen lens trying decide whether it should focusing telephoto or macro . i wish there switch lens make it macro only or telephoto only , so it wouldn't bouncing one focal length other all time . i've taken far more successful telephoto shots than macro . telephoto focal length bit long ( those us who cannot afford full-frame sensor camera ) most casual photography . i recently used this lens shoot some promo shots some massage therapists small eatery . i practically set up restaurant bathroom get photos i wanted , but opted this lens because it much faster ( 2.8 ) i wanted use natural light over flash . lens long heavy its range . addition battery pack grip , this lens added very weighty , so i may not take it w/ me my kit bag every shoot . once i add short fixed focal length lens moderate telephoto my kit , my guess this lens pulled out only special occasions . it tack-sharp , but it frustrating times	-1

this lens produces magical images . i am stunned its sharpness , contrast color saturation . simply amazing ! this great option standard zoom aps-c cameras great wide-angle option full-frame . aps-c ussers , i sold my ef-s 17-85 usm because this just miles better . i simply love this lens ! i am now so sold difference makes , i also sold my telephoto lens 70-200 f4 l.i believe this great investment because : * canon lenses lose very little their value * should canon abandon aps-c sized sensor full-frame 35mm , then ef lens range make your kit far more future-proof * once initial sting price receded , you never regret quality images you take this lensjust try it - it awesome ! some reviewers call this slow lens - i would disagree . many zooms 3.5 - 5.6 , or perhaps 3.5 - 4.5 pro-sumer range . there virtually nothing 3.5 f4 , constant f-stop advantage . f4 not fast , but it certainly not slow , either	1
this magnificent lens deserving high praise . general , i tend shoot " available light " towards wide angle , ef 17-40 f4l one perfect lens someone like me . aps size sensor camera ( mine rebel xt ) , it works approximately like 28-70 mm zoom -- perfect walk-around lens , giving you decent wide angle tele end , pleasing perspective faces you expect moderate telephoto . i spent two weeks ef 17-40 coast shooting nature street stuff small towns . it performed perfectly . but i only realized what real treasure i when i began second thoughts it eve long overseas journey . i asked myself whether i would not better buying ef-s 17-85 f4- 5.6 . after all , it gives you better reach - equivalent 28-135 mm zoom 35 mm camera . would it not perfect lens overseas trip ? dilemma worhty hamlet . so i decided order it amazon while i still time return ef 17-40 . soon ef-s 17-85 came , i some tests taking pictures still life , flowers portrait similar focal lengths full zoom . results put 17-85 shame . color light flat paled next 17-40 . but there still problem reach . i took portrait full zoom same person ( 40 mm or 65 mm equivalent 85 mm or 135 equivalent ) , cut out critical focus area both pix equalized two crops terms pixel numbers . unprocessed , 17-85 produced perfectly focused picture , 17-40 crop visibly softer , but terms tonality richness gradations , it way ahead its rival . photoshop rescue ! after i fiddled sharpening contrast cs2 , focus softness 17-40 gone , result better all-around picture same portrait detail . other words , if you wish take picture , say , building detail or monkey mug shot zoo -- situation calling telephoto 135 mm 17-85 capable -- ef 17-40 f4 job , fact better job terms textures tonality -- focus , too , if you little post-processing sc2 . i am returning ef-s 17-85 stick ef 17-40 , taking it my overseas trip . unlike ef-s 17-85 f4- 5.6 , which feels like decent consumer zoom , ef 17-40 f4l built like tank weather sealing . it should also come handy if when i decide switch full-frame camera ( ef-s lenses work only aps-size sensors ) .	1
there nothing like telephoto bring boats anchor up close when you're halfway up mountain . i got great shot tahiti just way just this lense friend mine used it cover her romance novel . it true lense heavy . canon says it weighs 1.7 pounds , but it seems heavier . no matter though , because you won't go gym if you heft this baby around awhile , side benifit , you'll get crisper , sharper photos then you would any other 200mm out there today . just think it body building photo shooting both same time . also this one won't break your wallet . serously , this one darned fine piece glass , you just simply cannot go wrong canon " " lense , just can'tjack priest , sailor home se	1

this bag easily accomodates my new canon s3 , lens adapter hood , room spare . recently , during trip europe , i also able fit several other items into bag : rechargeable battery charger , ac adapter , outlet adapter , two sets rechargeable batteries , well uv filter , i still room more . i've no doubt wide- tele-converters this camera would also fit , room spare	1
i've many camera bags over years , this one seems fit bill best . it roomy - carries camera body one lens , plus charger , extra batteries , manual , memory card , room lens or two . i wouldn't say it would able hold more than three lenses . we recently took this trip st. lucia it held up well , even repelling some unexpected rain . we very pleased . size perfect - roomy but not overly bulky . i'd highly recommend this bag !	1
it bit heavy but superb lens . interior construction quite bit plastic however which bit concern . i've dropped one onto hard packed dirt/soccer field w/no damage ... so it pretty sturdy :) if you live 1 stop less light consider newly released 70-200 f/4 . this new 70-200 f/4 canon save you some weight if concern	1

let honest ... " kit lens " adds approximately $70 overall price camera body not supposed canon l-series quality . sure , you find better quality lens , but not $70 you can't!i plan use this lens knock around lens allows me get more familiar my camera run off some shots . personally ( this personal preference ) , i find i tend want closer subjects anyway - 1.6 factor rebel xt , i'm great shape some my other lenses . if you don't happen already super wide lens your arsenal , you getting digital eos 1.6 magnification factor , then buy this lens . please don't let some other " lens snobs " sway you - few which actually " posers " snap less than 500 pix per year spend more time looking technical aspects picture instead its true artistic value . i hear them now .. " it isn't contrasty enough " , " barrel distortion horrible wide end " , " pin cushion significant " ... i say bah !! these statements true ... sure they ... degree . but let remember not everyone afford picky . buy lens , load camera fresh battery blank memory card get out there !! if you find yourself shooting wide end often , then sell/give this lens colleague go search ( higher quality ) lens ... very little lost . enjoy yourselves take lots pictures ... good luck	1
this lens must all beginner photographers . excellent sharpness really fast lens . i know i've heard many complain cheap feel it but less than $100 you can't beat it . yes it plastic mount , yes focus ring small but quality it pictures price make it definite winner until you decide move up much higher priced l .	-1

i compared number pro-sumer cameras became firmly convinced this best camera money . although nikon one time considered premier camera professional , they now take second stage canon not only engineering , but quality lens , innovative user-friendly design , overall quality . i used camera approximately one month delighted . talken pictures over 35 years - including professional - always using minolta equipment all those years , i am truly enamored this canon camera	1
this very easy use camera . simply using auto mode composing your pictures properly you get very good jpeg images . it also complicated you want make it . it many advanced features it . i shooting 35mm 32 years . my most recent before this one elan ii 7 years ago . it still working also . 30d my first digital i absolutely love camera . i generally work aperture priority mode tripod 100 iso when shooting landscape . but , camera very capable auto mode well without tripod . i like shoot raw so i tweek things bit , but jpeg images very acceptable . it also works extremely well portraits . it actually better than 35mm me because it very low noise even higher isos . 1600 looks like 800 film me . this very good value money my opinion	1
pros : - reduces flare ghosting when shooting bright light . - helps protect your lens dirt scratches . - somewhat protects lens case fall . better break hood than front element . - makes you look more like you know what you doing helps keep others carelessly walking front you . cons : - increase lens movement windy situations , kind like sail boat . - takes up more room your bag , even when reversed they still add diameter lens . - people take more notice you , help blow your cover if you trying keep low profile	-1
i bought this battery canon 30d take around thousand pic one charge . very happy battery performance	1
okay , lot said saving money , however there problems no-name or non-branded products . no matter what your " style " photography , you battery empty its charge critical moment . back-up essential . quality back-up battery get you through imperative . knock-off brands not hold same charge branded battery meant your camera ; although their manufacture may claim it . get zone get shot !	1
i started looking earlier version this flash when i saw upgrades 430ex i didn't hesitate order it . it what i've needed take my photos higher level . i shoot two magazines now instead taking my studio light into every shoot , i still carry it me , i use this flash instead it makes world difference	1
this very nice flash unit integrates well powershot pro1 camera . i appreciate zooming strobe tube match lens focal length well ability bounce flash off ceiling softer effects . i should purchased this flash when i first got pro1 camera	1
this great unit . works great purpose which it made . i'm going eventually get 580 so i use it slave unit ( wireless option ) wraparound lighting system . i would recommend diffuser so light subdued especially when you wish brighten fleshtones people photo golden light so they presented their best image . blue spectrum light not present us best way	1
this great lens joy use .... keep mind min 1:6 sensors 160mm so you limited respect . would nice if you could see lens settings like focus range preset view finder . don't like fact lens hood not mark show where it installed quickly .. not bad using logo indicator normal use , but always problems putting it back reversed put away . other hoods small dot etc help line it up . this lens grip double batteries get your attention after days shooting it . good news ... when you take it off you feel you pocket camera weight . i posted some action/panning shots this lens there didn't seem any others . couple aircraft couple auto racin	1
if you use this lens 1.6 camera body such xt , 20d , or 30d you end up 160-640mm equivalent which impressive range any standard . you also add 1.4 tc 896mm upper limit or 2x tc amazing 1280mm . course this comes price , i'm not just talking money . you use tripod , cable release , mirror lockup lot time when using such long focal lengths . plus this thing very heavy very large people take notice . so if stealth photography your goal , go something like 70-300 . said , this amazing lens , admittedly little slow near long end , but get down f/4 would most likely doubled or tripled price weight , so it seems like acceptable trade-off . if you want sharp pictures , amazing zoom range , good workout , but don't mind center attention , this lens you	1
this lens super-sharp , colors come out vibrant , it two modes , push/pull ( some people don't like , but your zooms super-fast ) . this probably best canon telephoto lens terms focal range . one bit warning ; it not only fairly large made metal ( not plastic ) , but it kind heavy -- while it doesn't weigh 50 pounds , aware it not light . carrying it around when attached camera , you carry equipment lens , not body	1
i bought this lense recently . first i thought it heavy , but once i got used it , i decided it heavy due quality . it big lense , tripod mount very useful , especially balance . you can't but notice quality this lense . function very useful . combine this lense 2x extender , you've effectively got 800mm lense . anyone looking zoom lense , this one seriously consider . sport , function brilliant , wildlife ... well , i go how good this lense . bottom line - well worth buying	1
this thing perfect carrying your stuff around not-so-fattening way . i hvae external flash , macro kit , 28-80 lens , 50mm lens , 18-55mm lens , dslr w/batt grip 75-300mm lens attached all fit into main body this thing . everything seperated dividers making me feel confident safe while walking , hiking , biking , etc . addon pouches seem make it bit more bulking you'd want , but bag all itself fantastic i can't recommend it enough - get away huge bulky shoulder bags !! lowepro it again	1

i agree all positive reviews this lens . it great lens , give certain silky smooth bokeh 24-105 lacks gives nice bright viewfinder . it couple quirks though--it very heavy so prepared . lens this quality high speed need lot glass there . -when you zoom out wide , it actually gets longer which bit strange . sometimes when you taking group picture you need zoom out bit fit everyone shot , subjects see lens moving towards them think you going closeup . this partially remedied using included hood which masks lens bit always extended .	-1
i think it very well could so i'm not going differ those who say it . i bought this use new 5d itt simply outstanding every regard . so far , i've kept it 5d can't bring myself take it off . i considered couple lenses , including 24-105 f/4 which lot appeal price same . but this lens i chose part because i already 70-300mm f/ 4.5 - 5.6 lens overlap seemed waste while extra stop helps . i no regrets it . sharp tack quick . i note this not compact lens , especially hood it stretch out lot when you widen field . it also not light . this lens 5d give your neck back pain , assuming you work more than one camera . but focal lengths covered just ideal require none compromises longer zoom range require . , i've got 18-200 20d . 70-300 , while not , specs out range virtue real compactness , but it ' not lightweight . these two lenses cover just everything me . i keep 10-22mm 20d extra-wide shots . since writing initial review , i've since traveled several weeks this lens it fully lived up expectations . given difficulties travel these days , i am concerned problem not able carry it me -- not problem date except britain . but always possible . , despite weight , i might favor 70-200 f/ 2.8 usm second travel lens- i like brightness focus . one suggestion . there temptation use this lens wide open lot time . it very good sometimes that best thing . but i've also found this lens makes beautiful images stopped down good deal short night time exposures tripod remote release . effect lights , etc . considerably different extended depth field .	1
i bought this lens replace ef 100-300mm ( usm ) we my wife film shooting days ( not common lens , apparently ; 75-300mm seems more widespread ) . older lens produced some surprisingly good pictures ( quite sharp ) , but handheld shots hard get right long focal lengths . image stabilization feature this lens works remarkably well , but it quite bit noisier than ef-s 17-85mm ( my first lens ; you hardly hear gyrations all one ) . sharpness quite good ( probably tad better than ef 100-300mm , although it not foremost strength this lens my opinion ) . i surprised how much faster i acquire focus this lens , even though reviews suggested it still falls short l-series lenses ( see e.g. " flying gull " shot i uploaded " customer images " set ) . if you want shoot hand-held 150mm+ , i don't think this lens much competition under $1000 canon eos users	1
this good zoo lens . it not heavy or noticeable something like 100-400 lens . also , 3 stop smaller size weight this makes great backup lens 100-400 trips or when i just don't feel like carrying around 3+ pound lens all day . so if you don't want deal cost or size series lens this one next best options	-1
i used 1.4 ii extender over year . it gives me amazing detail my 70-200l f/4 lens 20d . i use it mostly wildlife butterflies . contrast good colors pop . when shooting sunny day shutter speeds still quick f/ 5.6 background blurred beautifully . shade areas low light tripod must ! there hasn't any sacrifice subject detail . i see individual hairs butterfly bodies even when shooting wide open . this great way get closer without paying significant amount supertelephoto lens	-1
excellent camera high end capabilities . easy use intuitive system controls	1
impressive feature list wih affordable price , serious ameteur . i've using 20d 18-55 , 50mm 1.8 , 35-80 , 80-200 500/1000mm lenses . i am not disappointed . i am planning upgrade series lenses but slowly . i not mean over entusiastic canon , but i am yet see nikon camera same specs same or ever near equal price . i've got fm10 film photography . i love both my cameras . impressive features include : mirror lockupiso 3200 noise reduction18 custom functionsaccepts entire series canon lens . heavy metal body ( no cheap plastic feel	1
i gone old 640x480 nine years ago 3.1 last few years canon 20d now , what pleasure shot . battery life not issue even over 250 shots , which should sufficient most anybody . there small learning curve but you would expect this any new camera . lens choice great idea which came earlier review excellent walk around ability this lens general shots closeups those favorite flowers . those individuals who fence this product i tout it all i spoken . it turned good photo experience our west coast road trip into real serious photo shoot , it also uses commonly accessable compact flash . built flash works well not explore options this time . delivery this item when promised nice bow package	1
typically fine original design canon . i " chinese " copy - it really - it works but it not same mfr own .	1
this lens pouch very durable good quality . it compacts down not unneccesary bulk . might seem alittle pricey but worth it long haul .	1
i got this lens cap when i ordered close-up lens my camera , powershot s1 , because it recommended something people who ordered part would also order . i , therefore , assumed it went same camera , or lens/adapter i ordering . however , it not appear fit either camera itself or any attachments , so i now wish i some more research determine whether it would actually fit my equipment	-1
first , canon 1ds mark ii awesome professional camera . this review completely misleading amazon offer 42% off . this biggest joke imaginable . amazon website shows list price $ 11,999 . 99 . when canon launched this camera msrp wasn't high . it $ 7,999 . methinks someone calculator got carried away . anyway , after adding it my cart see unbelievable low price it turns out its within $100 what every other reputable online shop selling it . i expected more amazon . this behavior reprehensible	1
i shooting digital four years now mostly kodak dcs cameras(660 through dcspro ) . life long nikon guy it big decision make switch canon 1ds mk2 . this camera light years ahead any kodak digital slr . i use this camera studio product , models , location , low light , you name it . canon never produced anything but astounding images me . all image parameters including sharpness far superior any old images i my kodak days . yes it pricey but if you working this camera you pay easily long before it useful days over .	1
this item good companion use battery backup ; i recommend this item all people using digital rebel xt . this battery long life after full charge , very light small piece you accommodate into any pocket or bag , i'm very satisfied this purchase	1
haven't used it yet ( bought it trip next month ) , but it arrived promised exactly described .	1
sd110 not good digital camera . better yet find something else . i've this camera almost year but i just seldom use it because result pictures very disappointing . it just fine downloading them internet but when you it printed paper , pictures get blurred . now , im looking digicam won't disappoint me	-1
strong rigid , easy control head so you it loose free movement but tight enough camera doesn't flop over . opens closes very easily . it kind expensive $50 but its probably worth money	-1
this monopod exactly what i expected good price . it extends very smoothly , stops hold leg firmly height i set . easy set up adjust one hand so i change height camera attached	1
i few ' ' lens , this far my favorite . reviews saying this their favorite lens not kidding . there plenty other reviews going over all features , but i would like add non-is . i purchased non-is version because i not want fork over extra million-dollars . if i knew i like this lens so much it would become my favorite lens , i would splurged . somewhere great-big-internet i read comparison two versions . version clearly shows less sharpness , but it not clear if only when . i'm not sure if it would noticeable digital	1
this hood comes 70-200 lens my local shop didn't stock it . they said it special order part it would take week it come . i ordered it friday , received it wednesday . not bad . thanks amazon	-1
this camera cord shoe works well . however , it break relatively easily so i suggest two any given time . also , cord length too short times two long depending your needs	1
looked this lens both camera shop line finally decided after much comparison other lenses finally purchase it , have'nt regretted it one bit . this lens clear excellent color , saturation sharpness without any or minimal post processing . coupled external flash it great indoors well . using it my everyday walk around lens . zoom range excellent(rebel xt/xti 1.6 magnification ) . though it somewhat big side , it won't tire you out carrying it around your neck . purchased hood seperately which , money should came lens . anyway , this lens offers excellent value money you won't regret investment	1
i always used third party lenses before but after trying this canon i say i am impressed quality , it feels like solid piece equipment rather than hunk lightweight plastic . i find my photos much sharper due lens itself . i tremors my hands so difficult time normal lens but helped tremendously . i like range zoom it pretty much all purpose me ( used kit lens only once since i got this lens when i needed wider angle ) . i could occasionally/rarely use little more distance but nothing perfect . my only complaint lens heavy pretty much doubles weight my camera ( rebel xt ) . you know it around your neck after few hours shooting . i haven't any focus hunting problems , which i constantly 3rd party lenses . lens very quiet which imo good thing . reasonably priced lens it well worth money	-1
all reviews i read , i expected certain pros cons this lens . i not disappointed . pros : very sharp lens very good colorscons : vignetting wide open , little too contrastyfor myself , pros outweighed cons price . it ideal 1.6 multiplier cameras , where it becomes 38mm lens	-1
i bought this grip year ago after shooting homecoming weekend my school , central michigan university . pain it saved my wrist able shoot sports vertically without hang my hand over top my camera huge relief . recently though , after year solid use , i've problems it . there days my camera suddenly say my batteries dry - after charging them day before . i've checked , my grip not part series recalled similar problem . i actually removed grip , batteries , restart camera correct problem . -- this big problem middle sports match -- however , grip great addition 20d/30d models . it not same feel using 1d , but it close you're going get . $150 , you can't go wrong vertical shooting doubled battery life . it also simply evens out weight camera , especially heavier l-glass lenses your camera	-1
i appreciate difference balance battery grip provides long lenses . e-1 hand strap attached this addition provides very solid , secure grip . also , bge2 comes carrier 6 aa cell batteries those instant dead battery emergencies	1
although people problems first generation this grip , i've completely satisfied mine . recently , i've shooting 300 2.8 , it would much more difficult without extra length grip ads body . similarly , second set buttons vertical shooting makes big difference , too . ( one note : when shooting vertical , it hard actuate thumb wheel impossible use joy stick -- which i frequently change focus points -- without moving my right hand . ) holding two batteries , grip also keeps me worrying running out juice during high volume shooting sessions . grip still little flex it , but i've never any power problems i've read here elsewhere	-1
i'm recreational photographer , i love this camera . this my 7th month beast -- since i pre-ordered it early amazon mistake . ( long story)before buying 1d mii , you should know few things : 1 . it easy overlook spec camera usb connection 1.1 not 2.0 . this 40 times slower , canon clearly intended mark ii connected via firewire . said , i occasionally use it my laptop road , which only usb connection . it convenient port there , but my 1gb cf card takes good half hour empty . 2 . time you've attached solid series or comparable lens this camera , it weighs enough lugging it around your shoulder , even without camera bag full tricks , quite burden . also , i talking professional photographer who wouldn't buy model just because cameras this heavy give her wrist trouble . if you've never held camera this size your hand , i recommend borrowing one first or checking our your local camera store , even if you ultimately buy amazon . 3 . camera conveniently supports both sd cf cards . unfortunately there no way copy two cards using camera . it not gigantic deal , but there times i wait get home trip free up sd card when i didn't camera cable , but just external cf reader . those really only 3 things i wish i'd known before i bought camera ... but would they affected my purchase ? probably not ! i said , i bought camera mistake . it loads fun ? definitely . i prints almost good medium format - 100 times convenience .	1
hi canon lover , it perfect professional users who love capture excellent image . not wait longer buy soon you you not lose anything . keep it up wonderful day canon products . best wishes , appreciation canon product	1
i bought this filter my 28-135 canon lens so far it worked out great . unlike some other tiffen filters i bought , this one fits just right lens . all sides even it sits flush against lens . i haven't noticed any artifacts pictures i've taken yet , but i haven't really much chance take many pictures lens . night shots i've take so far , i've quite pleased , however	-1
got this my 580ex flashes shooting weddings . works great recycle times excellent . it last entire event filled 2500mah batteries	1
so this great starter lens , it came my canon body when i got my camera , i've used it tons . it light , smooth , fast focus , cheap . my only problem number times i found myself stepping back because 35mm end zoom wasn't wide enough . i now carry 22-55 instead love lens ( come amazon - get it stock ) . if you're budget then this lens great . if you afford little extra go 28-80 instead	-1
this great lens , amazingly sharp . only thing i would say if i money 2.8 version would even better certainly something i'll consider upgrade future . use fast shutter speed or mono/tripod this thing . anything below 250/sec gets problem 200mm	1
like many people my decision telephoto zoom lens came down buying canon 70-200mm f/4l or canon 70-300mm f/4- 5.6 usm . trade offs seemed clear first . former performs slightly better ( see canon website mtf data ) , better designed built , faster " " lens status . user comments ratings ( more than one site ) slightly more favorable lens . 70-300mm improved course longer focal length . both cost same so money not factor my decision . i eventually decided lens initially disappointed . photos ranged wonderful not very good all . fact , i almost returned lens . eventually i figured out problem . my yard heavily shaded so most initial photo taken low light i selected shutter speeds too slow . avoid camera shake you need shoot reciprocal focal length or faster . sounds simple but digital rebel xt ( which i using ) you need consider camera 1.6 multiplication factor . so 200mm you need shutter speed 1/320 or faster not 1/200 like i initially thought . once i made speed adjustment things changed better . still i some mixed feelings my decision . when light good this fantastic lens but feature offered 70-300mm i would probably get photos i miss this lens . i can't fault performance this lens its limitations i given it 5 stars . other words it what it supposed very well but my message other buyers consider where you most likely use lens before buying . remember becomes increasingly important you extend focal length . if your camera already extending it factor 1.6 you may find very attractive feature . ( note 70-300mm recall certain model numbers because problems when using lens portrait position . ) way , i purchased amazon it flawless transaction	1
what you say , other than it 4 times cheaper than 50f 1.2 . not , but great bright fast quiet lens , small optically superb . crop camera it 80mm portrait lens . super	1
this awesome lense , especially money . i would still purchase this one . there nothing second rate it . however , canon new series version their website photo . it 50 mm normal ef f/ 1.2 usm 1599 . 00 . i heard photographers who shoot whole weddings this one 3 hundred dollar lens 50mm lens .	1
i 580ex it works great . i hopeing it would work studio light but nope so dont try it . only thing you mindful distince flash subject	1
technical details this lens found abundance elsewhere , so i'll leave experts simply say : this my favorite lens . i love this lens so much . i half dozen other medium high-end lenses , this one i keep camera 90% time	1
i bought this lens when i purchased my nikon d70s february . i admit i not used it too much . however , when i used it , i am pleased results . mostly , i walking around town practicing taking photos , i little use 85mm , because it not good " point-and-shoot " scenes . when i taken portrait shots , however , 85mm very clear creates great depth field , which i find important . i hope this helpful	1
battery charger original equipment . i used it canon batteries two different no name batteries rated nb2l . all charged properly useable my canon zr500 . charger small easy travel making it unnecessary cary large quantities batteries	1
i purchased this lens take photographs vintage wristwatches . i use original canon digital rebel shots really very detailed . it easy use fact , i hand hold camera capture details hand-made craftsmanship watches . its 2.5 opening welcome change when you use shooting zoom lens it quite sharp edge edge . if you own canon digital slr want pocket some extra coin then this lens you .	1
canon ef 50mm 2.5 macro lens yet example canon doing fine job catching up likes nikon , zeiss leica respect optical design ; optically it may best 50mm macro lens currently available 35mm slr film photography . i am impressed lens cheap this counts least one aspheric lens element apochromatic lens design ; unfortunately it not nearly durable lens celebrated series lens line or canon ef 100mm macro lens . unless you constantly working out field taking close-up photography , then durability this lens lens mount barrel should not issue . more importantly user quality its images , read some test reports this lens , i no doubt it capable performer . those interested digital macro photography may choose look instead new 60mm macro lens , which optimized use canon digital slr cameras	-1
i'm no means expert ! this first digital i owned . it took me long time because i so used my film camera . but i searched long hard find what i thought i wanted . so far i am not disappointed . first size threw me because everyone else bigger camera i felt it would hard handle take good pics . but that not case . i like feel , size ... i like able throw it my purse ... it takes great pictures use my e-bay , sending family friends . i haven't any pictures printed it yet , so i don't know how exactly they come out , but i'm thinking they should okay since my online pics great . i haven't single blurry pic , both regular close up . video works well ... it lots little options i don't use .. like sounds each function , but i change those if i want . overall i no complaints	-1
hi i am surendranadha reddy i purchaged canon sd500 7.1 mp . it verygood digital camara . previously i used pantex also good , but this photos very natural realistic . one more amazon price also good . thank yousurendr	1
i not take more than one bags . this bag big enough everything .	1
i bought this bag use my canon elura 100 camcorder . camcorder these days small camera , but i knew i'd need lot room accessories this bag fit bill . i this bag right now : camcorder , 5 minidv tapes , extra battery , head cleaner , extra wide angle lens , external mic , l-bracket mounting mic , lens cleaning kit , remote control , all wires , lens filters . i still room quite bit more ! what i love this bag it really big bag doesn't all feel like big bag - that great thing me ! inside super configurable which great ' cause you set it up way best accessories you so everything fits , but doesn't move around . this same bag cost almost double best buy other retail stores so it steal here amazon ! i love it	1
pros : - reduces flare ghosting when shooting bright light . - helps protect your lens dirt scratches . - somewhat protects lens case fall . better break hood than front element . - makes you look more like you know what you doing helps keep others carelessly walking front you . cons : - increase lens movement windy situations , kind like sail boat . - takes up more room your bag , even when reversed they still add diameter lens . - people take more notice you , help blow your cover if you trying keep low profile .	-1
question : canon s2 only 1 color - silver . i believe this telephoto converter came only black , doesn't it look silly silver camera long black nose ? i going get this adaptor but i am holding back because it color . instead , i am looking find adaptor converter kit comes silver instead black . although i don't this converter . assuming i am satisfied its quality featuers , i would only give it only 4.5 stars because it color . anyone any ideas	-1
this hood more than adequate job controlling flare ef 100mm f/2 . additionally , hood provide protection those who 1 ) not adorne their lenses uv/sky filters , or 2 ) so adorne them ! lens already capable performer ; it moreso hood . price bit steep , but not effect its performance . thus , my rating stands	1
very convenient . easy use . paper cartridge matched up quantities smart idea . sometimes printer jams but easy clear . i find colors bit dark skin tones not balanced most attractive . if they work these items this would fantastic device i would probably keep several office , home , garage , travel ... use lot media cartridges too . i am one those takes 800-1000 pictures two week vacation so i really would use heck out these cartridges if image quality better . i usually make 3 or 4 copies each print mail friends pictures	-1
we love this produc t.t ook me minutes hook up . so easy use . i understand total cost printing few cents more than what you get costco . but . its ease use home ! specially if u guests home .... you wanna give instant photos ... hmm .... cosco/walmart .... going christmas day ..... i dont think so !!!! my guests love it .... when we give them photos .... right after party ! everybody gets kick out it ! amazon ..... goog service ! time !!!	1
purchased printer dock camera bundle , local office supply store $100 . it only came 10 picture sample cartridge , so i purchsed this amazon . amazon best price around this item free shipping . it works great . no complaints . paper not quite shiny or thick epson photo glossy paper i still use some pictures , but works well my classroom , give my students . pictures not run like some inkjet pictures if you accidentally drip water them	-1
i also sb-600 this product , sb-800 , much better - worth extra $100 . it much easier use since it simple menu structure not wierd button combo selections sb-600 . flash output better , recycle time better you use flash commander other wireless flashes . also extra battery holder fifth battery reduces recycle time further never comes off my unit . diffusion head also included so you don't buy separate one stofen ... works great	1
nikon designed this unit exploit possibilities their latest digital slrs while still compatble their oldest f-series cameras . sb-800 more expensive than sb-600 , but it gives you more control more light . you may find more light critical if you want use bounce flash soften shadows . i would given sb-800 five stars if user manual little better . nikon obviously tried very hard provide good documentation , make user interface intuitive possible . but , unit so many features modes inevitably require effort learn , present cases where you working against built automation . expect make large number experimental shots if you really want learn how use this unit . my chief plea nikon would more straight forward explanation cameras like d50 not ttl flash . so called i-ttl uses pre flashes computation set up calculated flash rather than real time measurement during exposure quench flash . one would normally expect same result , but not if slave flash used . one beauties sb-800 , however , it used slave unit using its own sensor determine when master unit firing , even if ( case d50 using its built flash ) camera sb-800 not communicating i-ttl info via ir pulses	-1
those you who d200 wondering if you need this flash consider this . d200 built flash acting commander you use sb800 off camera . just set it up it included stand coordinate flash camera conrols you now ability capture portraits look professional . set it up behind your subject , off side , angle bounce anywhere . i am sure you get idea . just one more reason why nikon great value . think what it would cost you similiar capability your canon . this flash may seem high priced but it most sophisticated unit market my opinion . good luck !	1
i'm amateur photographer , mediocre skills . this flash makes all my photos look better vs built-in , little no intervention my part . i use it digital rebel . i like flash varies intensity , depending ambient . time flashes reasonably quick ( particularly when ambient doesn't require full flash ) . avoid washed out faces , i'd always gotten accustomed bouncing flash off walls/ceiling ( my old camera setup ) . i've learned i don't need 420ex , almost always keep it directly pointed subjects ( unless i'm trying purposely create shadows across people faces ) . i also seem get much less redeye vs built	1
first off , this lens works wonderfully canon 20d , 30d 5d . image stabilization gives photographer serious edge . my experience , when active , i'm able shoot much lower speed , without any blurring . throughout range lens , image sharpness excellent , although little soft when you zoom near 300 . otherwise , 75 280 aprox . image quality astonishing . i shot weddings , sport events , low-light conditions very cold climate conditions lens performed flawlessly . ability focussing manually plus . automatic focus always accurate . just few times more than 3000 shots lens slowed bit when focusing , but i must say objets moving . weight lens ok , not too heavy , construction seems according canon standards . when shooting particular situations , silent usm mechanism really welcome feature . overall , very nice lens serious amateur photographer	1

i so much fun this lense managed take some pretty incredible pics . i use this lense probably 95% pics . i 10-22mm , 28-300mm , 100-400mm , all which take great pics but this 17-85mm works great general use	1
got it two days ago , can't say how much i love it . my camera fits perfectly , i even put my video camera . although it doesn't wheels , i move head around any direction make it stiff easily . i love double extensions legs then neck extensions minor adjustments .	1
i am 6ft tall this such perfect tripod someone who beginning/novice photographer occasional moderate use ( would my guess ) . my fort� post-production , i am graphic designer needed something use my new dig camera . i lot research tripods this seemed what i needed my usage . plastic clips concern me somewhat durability long haul , but i would love surprised just my nerves luck talking . how you beat price regardless ? i am so happy this tripod so far . i love how tall it me particularly how easy it use . i so much research online found this 70 " one said " screw it " i am tired looking bought it . i knew i needed something accomodated my height there isn't whole lot out there us tall folks decent ratings hundred below dept . i didn't pesos make " hundred+ " purchase took risk here when i rated cost versus quality ( my head ) . i feel though i won this battle now . i like two " levels " ( i noticed ) make sure i am squared up this piece equipment . equipment smooth pan i using it my own photo work , video tours my husband realtor work recreation/family photos . i am excited use this more my dig rebel . legs extend easily . metal ( light weight ) body plastic clips pieces . comes black bag hold your tripod also . easy snap-off piece remove your digital camera attach . fact i just leave it always my camera it expedites process when i am hurry . tripod feels quite sturdy my rebel attached . i think this really good-looking tripod . it so so light weight portable . i love it not clunky loud assemble when pulling it straight out trunk/car quickly assembly . i would've liked seen manual recommended usage ways maximizing longevity product , but i am over it product great so far .

i purchased this gift my brother-in-law . he over 6 ft tall wanted tripod he didn't bend over use . i couldn't find one locally , very happy find this one online . he very happy his gift ! highly recommended	1
this grip great value price paid . batteries alone worth money spent . i've banged this around week out rugged bruce peninsula no problems it . i would recommend this anyone needing grip . money you save you put towards your next lens	1
i know it sounds too good true , i've read too many reviews where people say " i never knew how i ever took pictures without this grip , " but it truth . first thing i noticed vertical handle , it amazing . you shoot vertical shots one hand ! all buttons you need grip , shutter button , wheel , two buttons top right xt . installation , it joke , don't even read manual . you charge batteries , but mean time you put your regular canon battery , or 6 aas because this comes aa shell . think it this way , xt baby ... it easy hold if you small hands ; i don't , i knew camera small , i decided buy this really so i could better handle it , extra battery life whipping cake . i really don't know how i could stand hold camera without this grip . don't spend extra money canon model , this one perfect	1
my husband bought me this camera early christmas gift . first i wasn't love it . i disappointed because i wanted camera image stablization . this camera instead boasted its iso sensitivity settings fast shutter speed . ( they claimed it similar image stablization ) when i first tried it out i very low light setting experiencing some blur my images which exactly what i trying avoid new camera ! i almost traded this one something different ( cheaper priced olympus ) but thankfully i gave camera chance first decided play around all manual settings . there lot them menus so you fine tune it like you wouldn't believe . this ability change its setup what made me stick sony . however , i wouldn't say this camera ideal very low light situations . two preset choices shooting low-light scene without flash won't give you crystal clear pictures especially if you experience tiny bit camera shake . but again , it goes back adjustments menus , you make manual adjustments get pretty decent pictures minumal ( or no ) blur . but you take time find set right iso light settings . i highly suggest using histogram you pop-up onto screen help . unless you willing spend $200 more camera , you won't find one perform great very low light anyway . like my husband said ... " really ... how often you taking shots dark honey ? " hey , there halloween trick-or-treating fouth july fireworks other night time events i retorted , but he right . there really isn't lot real low-light pictures you take where you aren't using flash . i know lots people ( me included ) like try figure out all menu options settings their own before reading manual ... but this one , if you really want super amazing shots , reading manual give you lot insight how powerful camera it really . people always read manual this probably big " duuuh " ! but if you like me like try rush through figure it out , you missing out ton nice options . some great features : camera doubles video camera it only limited recording up amt space available your memory stick . other cameras only let you record pre-set maximum number minutes . i also like burst modes which allow you take shots fast succession . great action shots . but take note , when using burst mode you cannot use flash . ( again , watch out low light ! )i 3 year old daughter fast shutter speed ( burst ) works great well lit situation . just other day i caught shots her running around jumping up down came out crystal clear . no blur all . every flying bouncing hair her head came out perfectly frozen time . quite neat ! i gave this camera 4 stars because camera performs wonderfully every situation except very low light . but price , you can't much better anyway . its great buy i think just anyone would pleased receive it gift .	-1
i am very pleased this item . size right , resolution photos perfect . i am enjoying using camera	1
i am new slrs i cant belive how good this camera . this camera worth every penny amazing quality it produces . i always thot my old digital pics point shoot excellent , but looking back , they look terrible compared this .	1

it performs you'd expect . bar holds paper place , cutter cuts paper . i also got perforating scoring blades , those also work very well . using cutter perforator , i've made several custom-size notebooks tear-out pages	1
i weddings , portrait , outdoor photography i don't see any reason why i'd ever switch d70 ( other than d80 :) . this camera professional grade consumer price point . don't scared 6.1 mp . i print 20x30 all time w/ out any problems . i'd recommend reading thom hogans manual	1
kodak p880 remarkable bargain produces astonishing photos . its 8 megapixels zoom lens it operates like more expensive slr . quality photos , even highest zoom , astounding . anyone interested easy operate , high quality camera , this one	1
this third 8 meg sd camera i tried - it only one without using tripod indoors gave me sharp , crisp pictures most time . zoom smaller fuji or panasonic , but color saturation sharpness heads shoulders above others . excellent camera shoots jpg , tiff raw	1
this real thing . it seems impossible get anywhere i got it overnight amazon . wow	1
this camera amazing . i canon user many years , upgrading i go . i not think right now camera they could come out make me want upgrade 5d . this certainly my camera some time come	1
if you've considering digital full frame camera ( who hasn't ? ) this one doesn't cost arm leg . now kodak out picture , your choices eos 5d or 1ds mark ii , which costs more than twice much . you give up few things , such super-fast frame rate continuous shooting , but 5d resolution you need top-quality images , ability get true wide angle perspectives your ef lenses . i happened shoot this camera concert side-by-side vendor " " camera , both under available light 85mm f/ 1.8 lenses range isos . i found some shots i liked other camera , shot iso 400 , comparable shots 5d which , my surprise , turned out exposed iso 3200 . 5d absolutely lives up its low noise reputation . but don't take my word it , try one out yourself	1
just got 5d .. traded my 20d ... 5d more solid camera full frame sensor ... pictures great it easy use if you familiar canon system ... little pricey , but worth it !! you'll use it years	1
i bought canon eos 20d digital slr canon ef 75-300mm zoom lens take photographs my children various sporting events . magnification factor this lens perfect variety sporting events including lacrosse , basketball , swimming gymnastics . focusing speed very good capturing action shots . i highly recommend this lens affordable general purpose zoom lens	1
monopod functions i hoped price excellent dea	-1
great product price . however , amazon not specify how much it handle . my experience 5 lb . tried 8 lb it , start feel shaky . still usable if you handle it carefully , but not solid 8 lb load	1
it works just like one comes camera . comes little plastic bag	-1
we received our usb cable promptly . you know kodak usb cables special they not fit any other regular devices uses usb cable . these usb cables kodak only . product itself turned out everything it represented	1
case great ! it fits camera perfectly exactly what i expected receive when ordering . price right but shipping little higher than i expected	1
it gives proteccion handling you looking . buy it camera no regrets	1
works designed , performs well intended lens , construction plastic though	1
what wonderful lens !! i'm purely hobby shooter , but i like take nice shots . i took this zoo other day able take fantastic closeups polar bears , even through glass , pick out details butterfly wings . lens not heavy i feared , unlike some zooms it not telescope out under its own weight , so it comfortable enough keep carrying all day . i'm using it canon d60 am nothing but pleased performance so far	1
i am generally pleased this lense , if i could only carry one lense my digital rebel , this one i would take	-1
i found this lens resonable all around lens , although when it comes portaits or close-ups i would recomend canon 100mm f/ 2.8 macro . if your looking camera use it i would highly recomend canon 10d wow	-1
good advice other reviewer picture . said i three these really wouldn't want without them . these clean my camera screen glass my lenses without scratch every time . my opinion almost must your bag ! good luck	1
i am new slrs i cant belive how good this camera . this camera worth every penny amazing quality it produces . i always thot my old digital pics point shoot excellent , but looking back , they look terrible compared this .	1
it extremely easy use . hard figure out menu , but once there no problem . takes beautiful pictures . great action shots well . seldom find blurry photo it stabelizer built	1
i digital cameras 5 years still own olympus 5 megapixel , casio 7 megapixel . seems like megamixels alone just don't cut it me . i read rebel xt magazine looked up user reviews here amazon . i decided go buy one though i am really novice , i am extremely impressed . i never seen such stunning quality or realistic colors point shoot . i started basic settings love results . i am slowly progressing more advanced settings am getting better everyday . even novice who just wants stunning photography amazed this camera . i also bought tamron 75-300 autofocus zoom lens ( look it here amazon.com ) after lots practice , able take some great pictures . i brother uk who also into digital photography , after seeing some ( full reso ) photos i sent him , he rushed out bought xti ( called eos 400d across pond)and amazed it . i still lot learn but really cannot fault this camera . included software also excellent . record , some reviews seem think it too small hold , i big hands don't any problems all . i admit though this first slr i ever owned . i still keep point shoot keep my travel bag spontaneous photography but i am love my rebel xt !! this camera costs quite chunk change but i think it well worth it i recommend it everyone	1
dscw100 8.1 great shirt pocket point shoot easy menu directions added features built	1
ive it couple months now . i notice no difference it my canon bp511 . my only gripe it its cheazy silver plastic color , but hey , who looks your batteries	-1
bought this lens ' standard ' prime lens my digital rebel xt . what i found it fast , sharp , lightweight lens made camera great long walks . this would perfect lens take amusement park , hiking , or biking where size weight concern . i've also used this lens macro photography portraits where it shines . f2 bokeh wonderful center sharpness superb even f2 , much better f4 which what i use most time . negative side , autofocus noisy . compare , it like drug-crazed wasp trapped matchbox . maybe mosquito buzzing close your ear . it not louder than shutter , though . if this film camera i trying take candid shots , i'd complain more , but it 56mm equivelant lens . negative build quality . they really should make body this lens out thicker plastic . no reason skimp there ' feel ' lens certainly gives you much more confidence very little weight penalty . make it feel solid . i've got 52-55mm step-up ring it i've got slew 55mm filters . this also helps lens cap further body lens easier remove replace . if canon made faster lens 28mm same price point , i would gone way . my tastes , it would preferable extra field view assuming quality good	1
extremely pleased prompt service well pric	1
exceptional perfomance long life makes this battery great deal . always good back -up this battery comes handy	1
we bought this second battery sony w50 digital camera . these batteries , this camera , last long time . spare allows us keep one external charger swap quickly when needed . it original sony product so fits works perfectly	1
sure beats price buying polarizer , uv 2 nd filters individually	1
just got slingshot 100 my nikon d50 kit lens . previously , i bought nikon bag but this just bag fit camera nothing else , i found this unpractical . d50 fits perfectly slingshot 100 , though i readjust velcro camera compartment dividers first . this quite disappointing i almost no free space my camera compartment anymore ! i guess canon 350d , which smaller body , fit this bag better . anyway i no other lenses yet ( 18-200 still order ) so all my gear ( battery , memory cards etc . ) finds place this bag . bag fits very well , comfortable well-made . before buying though , check if your camera lens fit	-1
this bag very sturdy padded . description pretty scanty , but i took chance bought it . glad i . bag holds my jvc gr-dvl805u mini dv camcorder , strap , battery , ac adaptor cord , 4 tapes , remote , all connector cables . it kind tight squeeze all those accesories , but bag compact , comfortable , easy carry , camcorder still protected . bag also comes lifetime guarantee against defect . only thing could improved it awkward get camcorder or out bag while carrying it strap over shoulder ; zipper hard reach goes all way around top . that only thing could improved , could considered safety feature , because camcorder certainly won't come out unexpectedly . bag also very durable nice looking . i recommend it	1
i love using it , long exposure , great bulb . cheap cool .	1
15 years photography experience here ... sigma 15mm fisheye extensively reviewed compared other websites ( go ahead search ) this very good product . canon tighter focus * touch * faster focusing , but massive depth field this lens , it not problem all . aware if you use this 1.6 crop factor digital slr aps sensors like my 20d or digital rebel , then fisheye effect not pronounced film or 1.3 or full frame digital slrs . watch lens flare should direct sunlight hit it also ... but happens any lens protruding or bulbous lenses . this much better bang buck lens than canon equivalent which costs significantly more . if you search around , you find much lower prices this lens	1
marine pack dsc-n1 good enough get job . camera special housing setting change functionality camera so it used case . unfortunately , this means losing ability use manual settings . luckily , camera fine figuring out its own settings , though occasionally get picture just right you need it yourself . i taken case 130 feet several times never experienced leak	1
i love this camera . it everything you'd want compact point shoot camera . perfect taking pictures my toddler . fits your pocket starts up split second . never miss " kodak moment " .	1
no blurry pics !!!! it wonderful . i love different options , it easy use , it sleek small . i problem red eye - even red eye reduction doesn't work ... but it great little camera	-1
you reading non technical review your average fun photographer . so don't expect lot technical stuff . i finally stepped up fuji s9000 . i loved my fuji cameras ease use colors they produce . i little reluctant spend kind money it takes get into d80 . i am thrilled i . i finally digital camera when kids something i catch it opposed camera taking shot after they left room . super fast . few saturdays ago i outside our wooded back yard taking pictures changing colors trees . when i went take shot flash popped up . i said this isn't right sun filtering though trees but i took shot anyway . wow camera new what . unbelievable photos . easy handle even pistolgrip mb d80 . i also sprung sb600 flash great two dvd training program ebay . so don't afraid spend couple grand d80 accesories . you glad you . happy alabam	1
i market buy new camera last year walked into bestbuy alone just browsing . i older eos canon rebel 35mm camera 1992 , i loved camera too . so this my second camera purchase , not sure what i wanted , but i knew what i wanted take pictures . i take this camera everywhere , vacations , visiting friends family , take pictures scenery , sporting events , people . there lot options this camera i don't know how use , but can't wait learn them too . i upgraded my memory card 1 gb so i take lot pictures not worry running out room . when i travel or go sporting event , i take anywhere 75 200 piictures . i get lot compliments camera photos it takes great	1
incredible quality zoom ! low power consumption . buy 1gb sandisk compact flash card . it gives you plenty room 2-3 week vacation	1
great kit ! i haven't used any filters before but i tell i'll using these quite bit	1
after getting sd600 gift , i knew i get case it . i really didn't like any cases store wanted something custom fit . this case completely solid camera fits snugly it . i no problem taking camera or out but it not any wiggle room while it case . also case magnetic button close added security . overall , great buy	1
just what i expected , since this second one i purchased . i one , bought camera this case my daughter . case protects camera lcd screen , but still small enough fit pocket or easily purse	1
i like color . it fits camera perfectly . it really cute not bulky . it not just ordinary black camera case everyone else . it classy	1
don't buy this camera really . i it month taking good care it . i initially thrilled . lcd screen got damaged -- no i didn't drop it . treatment customer service so poor disturbing i shocked . customer service representative actually questioned my integrity proceed talk me if i idiot . $181 repair bill $300 camera not feasible . it great camera first , but i demand better treatment respect company . look better camera , look web comments their customer service don't buy this camera . i read very negative things sony but didn't think they applied -- they really true . i don't like called liar anyone especially when i am customer . camera month old it now garbage . while i understand policies policies terms warranty , i not accept such poor treatment customer service . i teach photography tell my students same thing -- if customer service respect matter you , then not buy this camera .	-1
this camera very slim like canon elphs but costs much less . it very high resolution easy use . battery lasts long time 2.5 " lcd screen very clear big . it lot different shooting modes , including custom mode where you set specific parameters like infinity lock or iso speed . convenience , every time you switch modes , screen tells you what mode should used , so you don't need carry around manual figure out how shoot your pictures .	1
i originally sony dcs w50 but returned it get w70 . pros 7.2 megapixelsmall lighthigh quality vga video recording sound3x optical zoomoptical viewfinder , you'd surprised how many companies doing away optical viewfindergreat battery lifebig lcd displayconsnon-standard usb port camerapro-duo memory card , come sony ! sd cards own marketno qvga video mode . vga ( 640x480 ) really nice , low quality mode 160x112 also good feature but why not qvga ( 320x240 ) , it would nice extra feature . sony i am very impressed negatives camera negligible long run , sure i would liked sd card slot , but pro duo cards coming down price . quality photos incredible . camera small sleek . this camera also offers several different photosizes . 7 mp , 3:2 ( 6 mp ) , 5 mp , 3 mp , 2 mp , vga , 16:9 ( 2 mp ) . all standard features , macro ( which incredible ) , red-eye reduction , low light , etc . there three other camera sonys line . dsc w30 w50 which both 6 mp cameras , w100 which 8 mp camera . i stated before i originally sony w50 , 6 megapixel version , but decided i should spend extra $50 7 mp one . lcd prone fingerprints , but they easily wiped off . price quality this camera steal all other 7 mp cameras currently much more expensive	1
i through 6 cameras past 3 years , all different kinds brands price . i changed so many times because they get stolen or broken ... this little pentax optio surprising though ! 3 months after it around , i brought it desert it got some sand it , but i it fixed . this same camera also fell three floors down nothing damaged ; neither screen , lens , nor flash . it just got cracked bit twisted , battery/memory card cover completely damaged , but it still works like it should !	1
i just got this camera month ago i am satisfied it . it lot features despite its size . point shoot i say it great buy , comparable other power packed cameras , it even takes better pictures sometimes . but i just give it 4 because i thought i could more it . but you can't much settings since it it own default settings certain conditions . but over all it great camera . if you're just after taking normal pictures you want something sleek , this definitely good buy .	-1
i'll keep this short , i assume most tec stuff covered . i sold 350d get 400d(xti ) . 400d focuses better , better ergonomics , same size/weight , takes great photos . i tried nikon d80 , but it loses way too much detail iso 400 up . plus canon line lenses fits my needs better , cheaper , available . nikon costs $300 more ( canon discounted ) , nikon raw converter adds $150 . so true cost difference $400-450 . i'd buy canon over nikon same price due image quality , especially if you shoot jpeg . btw , if you afford canon lenses(the 25-105l 70-200l-any 4 ) amazing . one caveat , any dslr , these cameras not p/s best some post processing knowledge how camera meters/exposes , etc . i can't emphasize this enough	1
i this camera week now . i bought ef 28-105mm lens seperatly . i don't know why , but auto focus not work right away . it took some fiddling around before i able use feature . i get gorgeous pictures this camera . my one complaint it feels small right hand . after 1/2 hour shooting pictures my hand got cramp . i small hands it still felt small me . if you considering this camera i'd go store see how it feels . i can't imaging able use it long time if you big hands . i'm still learning how use it . but so far its meeting all my expectations .	-1
while this lens great improvement over kit lenses focus often soft raw modes overal just not always tight . color accuracy very good , not perfect but very good . course color accuracy more often result your paper ( yes really - it ) than your lens after you get certain point . after using this lens 2 months shooting perhaps 20,000 shots it i wished i saved my money inevitable series lens . if color accuracy your main issue , sure look your photo paper too . hp , kodak , even low end papers inkpress all strang things color blur your images . try someone like moab paper . you amazed how much difference it make your color accuracy detail . i just switched kokapelli moab commercial prints am amazed results . usually case focus softest 3.5 though it produce surprisingly decent bokeh	-1
bottom line : i needed replace lens my canon rebel xt d-slr . ef-s first glance seemed like perfect replacement since canon produced ef-s series specifically compressed sensor d-slr line . after weighing pros cons two , i chose this ef lens largely basis price . it right choice , i haven't found any loss features or quality . multiplying range 1.6 35mm equivalence ( if you rebel xt , 20d or 30d ) , this model really just slightly wide angle stronger telephoto zoom . ( 45mm-170mm if it 35mm film camera ) if this range suits you , then this lens excellent value over ef-s wide-angle/telephoto zoom . you'll keep all features , save money faster lens . ef series meshes well current line canon digital slrs . addition , unlike ef-s series , they compatible all canon eos products including higher-end cameras like mark ii . specific observations weeks use : my first concern before purchasing this lens minimum focus distance 0.5 meters , or approximately 18 inches . i lot macro work transferring images into digital , so i tad worried . however , after getting lens zooming , i realized focusing distance wasn't really issue after all . most cases , i could manage stand six or so inches further away still get highly magnified shot . so you see macro function works well , i've uploaded image small hamster photographed 102mm . ( aperature pretty big -- after all , hamster moving target)my second concern lens quality sharpness , particularly wide-angle setting near edges photo . this lens exceeded my expectations . so you see quality this lens , i've uploaded uncropped picture sf bay bridge taken 28mm wide-angle setting . you'll see photo sharp all way through edges frame . ( it web-sized jpeg , so you should take into consideration use it mainly see sharpness photo , particularly near outside edges)i get unexpected bonus this lens . manual focus ring front . i love it . disabling auto-focus snap , position feel manual focus perfect sports or social activities where subject often not closest object . ring itself ridged made rubber , making handling breeze . while i hadn't expected replace my stock lens so soon , i think it ended up best . this lens actually superior one came xt . i lost some wide-angle function but gained much more telephoto . price excellent quality lens high .	1
ok start off i've heard different opinions camera sensor blowers .. some say it works like magic some say it make it worse . so i gambled bought this giotto blower . i didn't want buy all cleaning swabs , liquid ect rub it off ... seemed like annoying project . so i gave this blower try . i never much dust my sensor but when made my aperture smaller f/22 exact picture blue sky i noticed few blobs or dust spots . i wanted them off ... now heres where blower comes . i used it total 3 times it removed 98% dust off my sensor .. thats really really good my book $9 device . now i like 2 tiny dust spots my sensor i easily live .. or i could try use it few more times completely get it off ... meantime i'm very happy dust i got off it . buy this blower .... its no brainer .	1
i owned giottos rocket air blaster 2 weeks now love it . i use it blowing dust everything : camera lenses , computer screens out computer keyboards . it made nice soft material allows it stored flat out way . additionally , it creates sufficient pressure force away most dust particles course requires no canned air , it works you pump it . i'll never forced air again	1
best feature this flash wireless e-ttl feature . two 550ex one work master one slave st-e2 both flashes off camera fired e-ttl . draw backs : price , no manual control slave mode greater light control , size ( this thing big ) . plus side weighs out negatives . it great flash	1
this camera steal . reviews amazon helped me decide this camera sure it worth it .	1
after hearing consumer reports gave canon a520 best buy rating , i decided this must good family cameras . it joy own use . easy take pictures , easy work yes , it takes great pictures . it more bells it than i ever use . i very satisfied 4 5 mp cameras not wanted spend fortune more . i just need take pictures , review them easily download my computer . this much , much more	1
i never take my uv filter off my lens unless i am going immediately put different filter . there basically two camps out there , those feel you should always use uv filter protect your lens dirt scratches those feel it waste time only degrades your image . well , i tried going without one awhile then dirt started build up front element my very expense lens . although you clean front element lens , i feel much , much safer wiping my comparatively cheap uv filter time time again rather than chancing any actual lens damage . i think nearly unquantifiable loss image quality you may suffer uv filter , it well worth extra piece mind it gives me	-1
very small size ( fits my baggy jean pocket ) , fast startup , fast response when shooting picture . much easier carry around than my canon g3 . not well indoors when flash needed . lots red eye , much more than my canon g3	-1

4 starts because otherwise 5 stars inevitable : 1 ) slow autofocus ( hunt times ) but expected macro lens . 2 ) built quality not solid expected this price range . i bought this lens instead two purpose : macro portrait ! i thinking buying 100mm macro plus 85mm 1.8 but this lens saves me buying two lenses ! i very happy it what it . i don't flying insects very much so it not problem but said i able get 1:1 shot fly , see sample here : http://www.theteh.com/html/3rd_350d_54.htmlthere other samples this gallery here : http://www.theteh.com/html/my_3rd_350d_xt.htmlthe large aperture ( 2.8 ) means one could shallow dof great low light such this pic : http://www.theteh.com/html/3rd_350d_49.htmlfor portrait , i accidentally took this photo during london bombing women ' shocked ' incident unfolding public tv display . it coincident her background inmage winning reuter photo tsunami tragedy matching colour their dresses ! i quite far away so able capture her head toe : http://www.theteh.com/html/3rd_350d_25.htmlthis illustrate capability both macro normal photography using this lens . you not regret it unless your primary aim shoot flying insets where longer 100mm or 150mm macro lenses may needed this case .	-1
this lens well worth price . first thing you notice quality when you handle lens . it very solid construction . but once you mount lens where it really shines . clarity focus best i've seen focus super fast . macro functionality just awesome . i highly recommend this lens	1
this battery works my canon sd550 interchangeably withthe canon nb3l came it . i get many shots either one .	1
product great ! you should get it . usually , i'm skeptical abour getting generic brands , but this works perfectly	1
incredible piece equipment almost give away price . i no complaints this camera surpasses what i expected	1
this review really two parts : one amateur who using point shoots , or experience film based slrs ; other one prosumer or advanced amateur who either going digital film canon eos bodies or getting into pro-level digital shooting low end . former , camera pretty much all you need ; latter , it lacking key functionality , but workable . i'm latter category . i've freelance photo work past , but not since digital age began take off late ' 90s . i've shooting eos cameras since early ' 90s , added medium format late ' 90s wedding portrait work . i'll honest : i didn't like idea digital first . sure , workflow improvements over film sounded great , but i wasn't seeing quality digital vs . film . i still am very much believer , least prints , especially big prints , film delivers better overall picture quality . but quality digital slrs since release digital rebel so good , workflow advantages trump film all but rare situations . i'll still use my medium format equipment landscape outdoor pics i'll print large frame , but other than pocket 35mm , i can't see using film much all category , after seeing what i dreb . if you primarily amateur who either used using point shoot ( film or digital ) or who used consumer film slr , you'll find this camera easy operate use extent you used your other cameras . i bought this without lens , i other lenses packaged one didn't offer me anything , but those without canon glass , you get surprisingly good lens kit . remember , though , lens only fit digital rebel , its successors , possibly 10/20d line canon eos bodies . shooting pretty simple . charge battery , which easy -- charger blinks depending upon its charge . you look charger battery there see where you , charge wise . it doesn't take very long charge battery fully . once you battery camera , you'll need compact flash card . i recommend sandisk ultra ii cards . you won't experience any write time problems over above this camera natural limitations . then , set iso value ( 100-1600 ) , set either pre-programed mode one side dial , or traditional program/shutter priority/apeture priority settings other side , you ready rock . remember unlike many digital cameras , led back camers not function viewfinder . aside displaying various camera options , it shows what you shot after shooting . if you want use this advanced amateur/pro setup , you , but know its limitations . i bought this march shooting all sports it . i'm using canon usm lens , gotten some terrific shots . but i've also missed some led me decide sell this camera pick up 20d . problem i get into focusing speed zones . 2.5 fps only 4 frame burst isn't big problem it sounds . i still get good action burst mode , but admittedly 5 fps 22 or 25 ( 20d ) bursts much better . if you want use this shoot something like concerts or indoor events , you won't same focusing issues . you deal any flash limitations , but information , you read review . i'm not camera flash guy under any definition . only real problem i've this camera my shots consistently underexposed . 5- . 7 stop . i shoot exclusively raw mode ( never shot jpg this one other than first dozen or so shots ) it correctable when i convert images . this more minor irritation , may not noticable jpeg shots . i've seen others using this camera complain it well . this camera good consumer camera you find . if pro , or semi-pro , make something function his or her needs , you know consumer get everything they need out this . i've shooting since i 8 or so , owned umpteen cameras , this one fills its market niche good any them	1
i've owned one these cameras four years now , i very pleased it . it light , small easy carry . it takes beautiful pictures -- very sharp , good colors . pictures look good even when you blow them up so big you see individual pixels . it actually my second camera like this . first problem usb port side camera , i took it back store traded it new one . this camera also problem too , after two years , button back needed making settings stopped working properly . but still , considering cost camera quality pictures , i buying one . it worth it .	-1
i tried several digit-cams say you cannot find better camera this price . pros : + great value , low price+ easy handling+ portability , light weight+ great fuji colours , good auto white balance+ fast shutter response , close film cameras+ control over exposure , flash pre-programmed white balance+ it uses aa , great battery life+ changig images playback mode doesn't take hours+ excellent prints photoscons : - images noisier than competition ( but they more expensive also)- images too much compressed , therefore less detail , no control over jpeg compression ( but this same most fuji models unfortunately)- no control over iso- low resolution lcd , too dark low-light- no optical zoom ( but this price it ok)- camera cheap feel it ( but again , this price it ok)- weak flash outdoor night shots , but enough smaller room shots- flash recharge time takes few seconds , camera freezes ( but this same most fuji models unfortunately)- it uses expensive xd-cards- sluggish zooming panning playback mode- no sound videoi highly recommend this camera beginners or those who doesn't want spend more digital camera . i've read many negative reviews due it bad photo indoors . okay , it not canon g3 . first i thought same , but then set controls manual , set exposure up highest value then shot picture . end result much better than full auto mode . so my advice indoors low-light set exposure manually , you'll glad you i promise . colours well balanced , prints come out great , no matter how noisy images , you won't notice photo paper . this model now out sale , but if you find second-hand one good price don't afraid buy it , it excellent buy	-1
great camera , easy use after reading manual . light , easy handle . unfortunately little pricey	-1
this great camera those who need more than point shoot but not want carry bag full lenses . also , large sd card ( 1 4 gb ) this camera replace your video camera . one thing note , when you take pictures while recording video , it stops recording second or two while it processes your picture . this very obvious when watching your video	1

ordered one march its came fine ( not used or abused like others mentioned ) . amazon.com retailer . i use it mostly lens protection aspect it works great , fact i'm ordering right now	1
this it . i upgraded sigma ex 2.8 80-200 . i should spent money nikon first time . sigma very nice lens less , good alternative , but if you want it all , go nikon . leave your tripod home when you get this glass . i don't know how this compares , but i'm shooting hand held 1/30s shutter full zoom ( 35mm equivalent 300mm ) . vr phenomenal , wide aperature delivers beautiful blur , overall fit construction flawless . tack sharp images too	1
yes , this lens already legend , no , it not just bunch people trying justify spending whole lot cash lens . make no mistake , this lens big expensive . it not fitting into your travel bag nor it home friend party . bring 18-70mm , 28-200g or just bring cheaper ps type camera case you spill beer it ! 70-200 vr pro level lens gets almost everything right . it size byproduct optical design really makes few , if any compromises . this lens sharp ... sharp my 50mm prime sharper wide open you might believe or expect . d70 focus lightening fast quite exact . color rendition best i've seen . i much less post processing when this baby d70 . problematic side , this lens big . it heavy way , though reasonably easy grasp . i added harbortronics portrait grip handling/balance improved . it needs big bag focuses down bit under 5 feet . while it fantastic portrait lens , you need room get most out it . my first shots this lens put my more experienced lenses shame . bokeh , or quality out-of-focus areas creamy pleasing . subjects 3d quality them . vr system exactly what you'd expect . i sat my couch , framed text my dvd player 8 feet away shot f/ 2.8 iso 200 1/2 second exposure . 200mm ( 300mm d70 ) image sharp . without vr i got big blur . real question : you need 1700 dollar lens ? answer : only if you want it . quality all there level people talking this lens like it magic . i friends who shoot pro canon nikon . even canon users say 70-200vr best it kind . sell kidney buy one	1
puts protective glass over your expensive gla$$ without distortion .	1
after overpaying fancy camera store , i happy purchase identical filter amazon fraction price . these filters give you piece mind , protection sand , fingerprints baby spittle	1

i very small camera ( canon sd450 ) find this tripod perfect match . it light small easy carry included canvas case . it few nice features i didn't expect ( even though i read text ! ) like bubble level platform . this product excellent value . however , shipping cost much tripod . course , not tripod fault .	1
this cleaning pen just advertised . i used it daily basis since i got it , it never failed great job . i use this visibledust huricane blower , combo unbeatable . great value price	1
i skeptical when i ordered pen because i wasn't too sure how clean it would really keep my lens . last week i traveled through out mexico visited some beautiful places , seeing lot family members . all these family members around , few accidently touched my lenses . i decided it would perfect time test my new pen . end result ? perfection ! lenses looked like thru brand new ! i used carry little paper whipes designed lenses , but now i use nikon lens pen i don't need worry carrying whipes throwing them away	1
when it comes cleaning my digital camera lenses , i'm very afraid damaging something , so this little cheap product takes away all fear , all dust my lenses . --- cuando se trata de limpiar los lentes de mi camara , me da mucho miedo que se da�e , entonces con este peque�o barato producto , fuera miedo fuera polvo	1
over 90% pictures i took this canon blurry . no way you fix it . i really got fed up it . waist your money . waist your time . more important , waist your precious moments !	-1
don't buy this camera !!! prone " memory error " e18 errors after warranty up . cost min $150 plus shipping fix . this camera great until 23 months went then i started mysteriously losing pictures due file format errors . i switched memory cards it happened again . then " memory error " displayed after month or so losing pictures . now it doesn't work all . i called canon see what type service could provided if they would fix what appears factory defect since so many people reported this problem . minimum cost $150 or i could upgrade refurb s500 $199 w/6 month warranty . they kidding , $250 get me new one . what appears common problem i expecting more canon . guess i won't buying canon . google this " canon " memory error " e18 " see yourself canon cameras problems .	-1
this flash unbelievable , most time i use built-in filter because it so powerful , great value money . just takes some practice getting it adjusted correctly i said before it really throws light out there . highly recommended	-1
well priced works beautifully . no complaints - exactly what it said tin .	1
this excellent camera ! i purchased mine feb . ' 06 used it continually 2+ months before i decided write this review . first , i am avid amateur photographer , i wondered if this camera would worth expense , non-pro . i've found i not regret this purchase any way . i researched it several months even bought digital rebel xt first , thinking i'd rather not spend so much camera ( i like rebel xt it fun back up camera ) .... i confused which camera choose . most official reviewers either not review it , because there not " much " difference btw . it id mark ii or simply said if you wanted shoot sports or fast action , then 1d mark ii way go . i don't shoot those ... i'm wedding/portrait person . however , i also shoot landscapes fast moving animals well wanted weather proofing speed comes mark ii . so choosing 5 , ( time ) upcoming 30d 1d mark ii very difficult . one pro review site said mark ii needless upgrade mark ii . i found odd remark because canon changed almost everything they didn't like mark ii . you record both raw jpeg same time , different cards . 2.5 " lcd magnified any point , check sharpness , there definite absence noise shadowed areas you not pair this lense get excellent photos . aside my lenses , i use 50mm 1.4 , 70-300 85mm 1.8 excellent image quality across board . i am small woman found camera weight takes some time get used . however , camera itself so fast it compensated any camera shake i might , due weight , it speed . , now i am used it , i hardly notice it . multitude control buttons confusing , but if you used 1d mark ii , it not difficult switch . if you used rebel xt , keep manual handy your first few times out . whether you shoot jpeg or raw , photos manipulate well photoshop you don't lose any quality ( my opinion ) not 12 megapixels 5d ( which 1 only 2 reasons why i considered 5d ) . large enlargments ( 16x20 ) print up quite excellently again , you speed never miss shot . i've found shooting portraits difficult shoot subjects ( children , pets , someone who doesn't want sit portrait but his wife making him ... ) , speed matter often it saved me failed shoot ! 1.3 fov crop factor ( vs . full frame 5d ) definitely factor weighed . frankly , i use 17-40l get excellent landscape photos . wide ( 22mm ) i could ever wish , not get " fish-eye " . so , i don't find crop factor personal issue but it something i take into consideration my choice . while it limits my 24-70l my 24-105l only 31.2 mm wide angle , it gives my 70-300 " just enough " extra zoom boost ( 390mm ) i don't buy yet expensive lens . i've trying think negatives this camera , order give balanced review . i said , initially weight issue well learning controls . both quickly overcome . cost definitely factor , but especially anyone who this living , it definitely worth $ . i like everything this camera ( i've gone through several others get here ) . when i don't it me , find myself my a620 ( my " purse " emergency camera ) i get so frustrated a620 won't anything even close what i've now come expect standard all cameras . so i guess that one downside , because it large slr , i don't carry it absolutely ( though almost ! ) everywhere . however , overall , unless you want pay close $7k ds extra megapixels , i don't believe there better camera market . i realize while this review doesn't cover all technical specs ( you get either cnet.com or the-digital-picture.com ) i hope it helps someone like me who really difficult time making ultimate decision	1
this my first digital camera . i received it anniversary present ; my fiance thankfully * great * taste . anyhow , this particular camera took far best photos i ever seen ! pictures extremely crisp . i thought camera very user friendly lot fun use . i used it 13 months without single problem . until it stolen . :( so now i decided upgrade canon sd700 . way , i tried out all my friend family digital cameras just compare theirs my canon not single one theirs could compare pictures my canon a520 took ... so try it out , you won't disappointed !!!	1
i purchased this extender so i could more comfortable looking through viewfinder . 5/8ths inch doesn't seem like big difference , but it enough put some space your face camera . your face pressed against camera good thing , it helps stabilize camera reducing camera shake . however i find 20d very uncomfortable without extender . my discomfort comes more how eyepiece cushion rests eye not so much smashed nose . extender doesn't prevent camera pressing against my nose , although it clearly doesn't press much . my face still contact back camera . eyepiece cushion feels more comfortable pressed against eye extender place . install , you remove eyepiece cushion camera , slip extender then reattach eyepiece cushion extender . extender reduce magnification viewfinder , but not enough issue me . extenders purchased your eye glass prescription strength mind so one doesn't need wear their glasses when using camera . this particular extender not correct vision . this extender stays my camera all times . pros : gives your nose some breathing room . adds comfortcons : reduces magnification viewfinder	-1
i weddings , portrait , outdoor photography i don't see any reason why i'd ever switch d70 ( other than d80 :) . this camera professional grade consumer price point . don't scared 6.1 mp . i print 20x30 all time w/ out any problems . i'd recommend reading thom hogans manual	1

this excellent add-on close-up lens , not confused relatively inexpensive 1-2-4 sets sold aftermarket accessories . this double-element achromatic ( color-corrected ) lens made canon recommended lenses range 50-135mm focal length . it very sharp clear no color fringing . " 250 " indicates maximum distance subject 250mm main lens focussed infinity . actual lens power 4.0 diopters (+4 ) . it 58mm outer thread so you add clear filter ( uv or skylight ) protect lens surface . i am using it canon a620 required adapter , it produces outstanding pictures excellent detail sharpness .	1
i shoot canon 20d used canon ef 28-135mm f/ 3.5 - 5.6 usm lens my wide angle option . when preparing extended stay budapest , i decided it time invest faster , better quality wa lens . i reviewed lens lineup canon website decided canon ef 16-35mm f/ 2.8 . lens owner , i confident this lens would great addition my lens lineup . lens , this serious lens meant serious photographers . sturdy construction consists three aspherical elements canon ud glass which largely eliminate secondary spectrum . weather-resistant construction lens mount , zoom focus rings switch panel helps protect lens elements . this lens not compatible 1.4 ii 2x ii extenders . canon ef 16-35mm f/ 2.8 lens weighs 1.3 lbs/600g , accepts 77mm filters or holds gel filters . sure get good quality uv haze filter protect front lens element . not only i see this good practice , canon recommends doing so their site well . focus type standard twist zoom , permits auto or manual focus depending how switch set . addition , lens usm drive mechanism optimum af performance . included this lens front rear lens caps , lens hood , soft storage case , us one year warranty . case pull string soft case ( lz1319 ) also purchased separately . lens hood ( ew-83e ) used reduce lens flare protect front element certain situations . i admit i disappointed this lens while budapest . i found wide angle scenes focused subject distance , images soft . this precisely type images i wanted use this lens . just because this fast lens , it doesn't mean i shoot everything f/ 2.8 either some may claim . i good understanding exposure know how use aperture setting my advantage . it didn't matter what aperture i used , distant subjects soft my eyes . i wondered if lens needed adjusting or calibrating after hearing all great things people say . i lent lens friend who loved quality sharpness while taking close up shots . i then began wonder if i doing something wrong . after testing lens , i've concluded this not lens distant wide angle shots like suggested canon website . when subject matter much closer , like other side room or several feet away , this awesomely sharp lens . canon ef 16-35mm f/ 2.8 lens too different compare canon ef 28-135mm . clarity sharpness incredible close-up shots , auto-focus quiet quick . even though this lens didn't fit my original purpose , it found place my lens collection . i don't foresee this lens one my most used options though . canon ef 16-35mm f/ 2.8 comes price , but it worth every penny when used its strengths . pros : incredible clarity sharpness close-up shotsquiet quick auto-focus cons : heavy bulky ( this should expected these types lenses)distant subjects come out soft	-1

i bought sd110 camera , since i live hawaii , i underwater housing it . this housing great , because it allows you use all function buttons while camera protected housing . you power up camera , shoot , zoom , change modes everything but change battery , change memory card upload your pics onto computer while camera sealed up . i able take lots lots underwater surf pictures movies this camera . i very happy results . i treat my gear pretty rough , i water almost every day , not cleaning it all time although housing get scratched little banged up , it still worked great , it didn't affect quality my photos . then one day while rescuing swimmer distress , camera knocked off my kayak into ocean . i went back few minutes later search it . but unable find it .... i really bummed . four months later , friend friend diving same area i lost camera , saw something wedged reef , encrusted coral alge . he pulled it out took it back up boat-it digital camera housing . when he opened up housing took out camera ..... it powered right up !!!! so he took few shots boat then took camera home . he showed it his friend , they flipped through pictures he told him story finding it . one pictures i taken day i lost it , underwater self portrait . when my friend saw : he knew who camera it !!! so he calls me ... tells me story . i amazed . we figured camera housing lying bottom four months over twenty feet water , there few storms produced some very large surf area , so it likely taken beating . but it still maintained its water tight integrity . we all very amazed how durable it turned out !! i already replaced camera canon s500 it dedicated housing ( mostly so i could get higher resolution photos ) . after uploading photos onto my computer , i let guy who found it keep it . he cleaned up housing , it stays still water tight , only thing wrong it ( besides little surface crud exterior casing ) , few buttons jammed so they not work ( zoom , shutter power buttons fine ) . but not bad all camera bottom ocean several months	1

i don't know how i ever without this little item . its indispensable taking pictures tripod . it works easily efficiently exactly describe	1
i purchased this canon remote switch 4 months ago i use it almost constantly . this one most useful camera accessories i purchased . every photographer should one his/her toolbox . remote switch essential if you photos low light or macro photography . slightest movement your camera when you press shutter release could cause your photo ruined . this switch eliminates " camera shake . " before i purchased this switch , i use self-timer feature my camera time delay very inconvenien t.t here few reviews saying canon remote switch over-priced cheaply made . i don't think true all ! i would definitely buy this accessory again .	1
anyone who wants make their photos different , this lens ! 180 degree capacity fabulous auto focus capability , this lens takes ordinary photo turns it into something extraoridinary . i shoot magazines many photos selected publication taken lens . it expensive toy , but worth money when you see results . i highly recommend it	1
monster little pricey , everyone knows , but it good stuff . this unit attractive , works well nicely designed . only one very small drawback : unless you small pointy fingers , first battery little hard remove . i use little plastic relay tool lever it out , which i store right charger . but i stayed 5 stars this one	1
compact design .... bought it since 2002 ..... still going strong ... went soo many trips wit me ... easily fit ur luggage .... now i use my travel only use powerex mh-c204 my daily use ... take least 2 hours pics wit my minolta	1
leather , design , craftmanship all exceed my expectation . instead velcro , it replaced magnetic button , which plus . it also included matching leather wrist strap canon logo , plus . my canon sd40 also fit into nicely , although leave some room side	1
quality leather case great canon elph digital cameras . only negative there no place store extra battery or memory card	-1
excellent case , no question it . it stylish well-put together . this not worn belt , though , it must go pocket , purse , or your hand . main thing it keeps awesome camera safe sound , it looks good doing it .	1
this filter excellent cost efficient way protect your valuable lenses .	1
great product people want more out their digital camera . not so easy operate beginning , but learning quick results extremely satisfying . little dedication , you able manipulate secrets high end photography . best buy buck	1
i spent lot time reading reviews posts , finally i bought it , it best camera i used , i went old konica 35mm film camera sony cybershot 2 mp then not camera while later i kodak p850 ( great camera also , but slow my taste ) finally this s9000 , belive me this great choice it only camera i found positivly compared dlsr still prosumer camera , tells lo t.t he lack picture stabilization not big deal , it anti blur mode which almost same , full array controls manual settings help please amateurs not so ameteurs . it also first steps os face detection it multifocus mode , which focuses most times subjects faces where ever they frame ( not necesary centered ) , i mention it its limitations you know how compose your sho t.t he user guide easy read , understand follow , you don't know nothing photografy this manul you use most functions few hours easy . summary : 5 5 !!! nice camera	1
good price 9mp camera 10x zoom . image quality good . i'm still shooting mainly 3mp 5mp good results . spot metering works really well , especially while shooting bright day objects sitting under umbrella . macro works nicely . i still yet find good use super macro . camera recycles shots pretty quick . anti-blur mode ( using higher iso rate ) works well . controls/menu make sense . although i wish memory switch feature not buried too deep menu . that good feature . you 2 memory cards camera xd so cheap . you combined capacity instead buy bigger more expensive card . i especially like how menu displayed even inside viewfinder ( it exact copy lcd ) . way , i don't take my eyes off my object while cycling through menu . i wish battery life could better . effort conserve battery power , i shoot mainly using viewfinder avoid using flash using anti-blur mode . but bright side , one just carry more high-capacity , rechargeable aa . it just takes while get used battery consumption rate . i carry 2 sets backups where third one alkaline	1
i like this camera very much easy use gets good result	1
i went taking camera out its packing taking professional quality pictures twenty minutes . it amazing	1
very important shade camera lenses avoid flairs . it doesn't fit carrier bag designed canon s2 , s3 , though , which big time bummer . however , i would recommend it anyways , because quality pictures protection your lenses worth carrying different bag rest your stuff	-1
what wonderful camera . photos come out sharp clear . small size makes it very handy carry around you all times . photos load very quickly computer . price i would rate this " best buy " . i found only one drawback which i feel minor . very bright sunlight it difficult see object screen unless it shaded hand or piece paper or cardboard . but this minor problem would not stop me purchasing second coolpix l4 . you purchase 512 or meg memory card very little money . check amazon kingston or sandisk . i both they great .	1
i simply love this camera , it very tiny size takes great pictures you buy rechargable batteries or regular batteries if you should choose . it simple use , didn't even read manuel . starter camera or advance user , get this one , you love it !!!	1
hoods offer several benefits photographer . primarily hood shades lens stray light may result unwanted discoloration or hazing image , or appearance lens flare . shading your lens helps improve contrast image quality . hood not required eliminate these problems , any item used shade lens provide same protection stray light . hood convenient it built offer protection while ensuring it not inadvertently find its way into your image . photographers often state protective abilities hood reason one . this hood solid petal shaped one three quarters inch long offers limited protection keeping moisture wind blown debris off lens element . when place , hood protect lens impacting solid objects . so shallow petal shaped , even this type protection limited . even if protection limited , replacing damaged hood usually cheaper than repairing expensive lens . this hood manufactured canon 16-35mm f/ 2.8 ef normally comes included lens when sold new . there no need buy one amazon often suggests . since hood wider than lens ; it easily stored attached reverse position . this doesn't add length lens , but make it wider inch . inch may not seem like lot , but tightly packed camera bag , it huge . this lens isn't unusually wide so extra inch may not problem . while protective benefits exist , they secondary limited . i find impact hood my image quality more convincing reason use hood . considering impact image quality low cost compared my other camera equipment ( except lens case ) , purchasing hood money well spent . pros : improves contrast image quality reduces lens flare problems offers limited protection lens cons : takes up more space your camera bag store lens	-1
this fabulous reliable camera . feels solid . fantastic pictures . easy operate . new d40 announced over past few days , but its lack lcd display buttons manage basic camera controls ( reduce weight make it more user friendly ) would still make this my recommended nikon dslr . expect prices fall d40 becomes available	1
i felt price very competitive it received within time frame seller told me it would . camera very easy handle so far taken wonderful shots . it just what i hoping it would	1
my first digicam , bought it 2 years ago . simple use , great pictures , year ago ( hundreds pictures ago ) i dropped it ( no its case ) cobblestone road - no damage . never seen need replace it . i like common batteries it uses sd memory	1
it works great my ef 50mm f/ 1.8 ii lens . price this hood ring seems pricy compare lens price , but it job when it really needed .	-1
if you've bought sd550 , this great addition , case saved my camera couple times already scratches dings ( especially little kids around ) , extra camera chord long durable ( coated metal link chain ) extra battery course invaluable . i'd give it 5 stars , if i didn't feel these items should come standard camera . :	-1
i've my d2h 9 months now . i've heard magenta skin tones issue but never seen it .. skin tones my unit great . it seems this issue plagued minority users . camera very fast , exposes well delivers results . it primarily designed sports photojournalism camera -- situations where speed counts . it 4 megapixel wonder -- it true it only 4 megapixels , but they 4 great megapixels . images upsize wonderfully . i love my unit , am debating whether buy second one backup , or wait d2x . price d2x making decision bit easier i'm leaning toward d2h .	-1
don't mislead , this ab-so-lu-te-ly great product regardless if you big or small hands . it fits new rebel xti ( 400d ) too !! my hands small , but before bg-e3 grip i no real use fifth fourth fingers ( except tucking them underneath xt small body . ) bg-e3 , hand grip firm whole hand grabs camera . this gives you extra feeling pleasing assurance , not unnecessary sensation . better still , front panel bg-e3 rubberized so bottom half your hand won't slip away ( canon should covered camera own grip material instead using average plastic makes body mould . ) little extra weight not problem , rather it always comes handy counterbalance you zoom lenses ( say 300mm range ) . short , this accessory gives rebel camera user welcome feeling overall control sensation more professional gear your hand . extra slot second battery , course plus . i'm selling my xt soon new xti available , it nice know investment i made not long ago this grip , prove useful when i switch . now , if only future 40d ( who knows ) same compatibility ...	1
neccesary add cannon rebel . good product . too bad it doesn't come camera	1
i no investment dslr but narrowed my choices canon 30d nikon d200 . i always wanted nikon . d200 definitely joy hold it take good pictures ( i tried both camera store before i bought 30d ) . i lot research ( more than i care admit ! ) there no conclusive evidence one camera clear edge over other . depending your specific needs , one camera may " slightly better " than other . after trying out both cameras , i convinced 30d good fit my needs d200 . " value money " 30d clear winner over d200 ( i got mine when canon cash canon promotion going ) . also , beginner slr i found 30d its fully automatic scene modes easy start out . i don't expect use scene modes or full auto mode after week or two . i expect quickly graduate creative control zones . but use family camera , quick scene modes very helpful . if you expect use it more professional basis it'd probably not matter . additionally , when i checked it out store , i noticed canon 30d focused sharply almost every time . d200 not least few times . i'd take this grain salt though since it brief trial store . but i thought i'd share my experience . it may just anomaly actual equipment i tried out . i still find nikon d200 great camera ? absolutely ! i regret bought canon 30d ? absolutely not ! decision swinger my case really " money factor " . i more than willing spend up $300 more nikon d200 . but when difference became $550 it no longer became justifiable my christmas gift myself :-) my purchases included canon 30d [ ... ] , canon 17-85mm ef-s usm lens [ ... ] , sandisk extreme iii 2gb compact flash card [ ... ] i plan add external flash this soon , consider eventual lenses after i determine camera long-term keeper .	1
this camera incredible . i ordered it my husbands birthday he just begining figure it all out . there so many great features . one best how quickly you take digital pictures . our other digital cameras lag time shots , but not this one . pictures crisp it easy even novice like me use . i highly recommend this camera if you want take digital photography next level . it one best	1
this great purchase $150 . i bought it shoot amateur pictures family youth football games . images sharp across football field sunny day , i use canon monopod recommend it . it 75-300mm so i switch out lenses take pictures people standing close me . there 28-200mm lens but it much more expensive i like extra zoom	-1
exceptional portrait lens both digital film , nikkor 85mm f/ 1.8 usably sharp wide open tack sharp time you stop down even just bit . relatively small very light , it feels just right my hand . steve mccurry one my favorite photographers i happy discover many his great shots taken this lens . also , if you shoot manual focus body like f3 , you'll like solid but smooth feel focus ring . 85mm comes metal , screw-on hood . my preference plastic bayonet mounts , but i find i don't need hood often since this lens doesn't tend flare . two minor complaints this lens : first , bokeh not exceptional . that ok ; i'm not bokeh hound . but when i see creamy out focus specular highlights 85mm f/ 1.4 produces , sometimes i dream spending extra money . second , i wish it af-s . but even without af-s , it focuses faster than you'd expect . finally , construction solid . i've used it heavily two years deserts , jungles , glaciers ( ok , less glamorous places like around apartment ) it still looks brand new . short , my favorite lens . absolutely worth every penny	1
if you don't need speed or can't afford expensive 85mm 1.4 nikkor lens or both , then this lens may right one you . it took nikon while produce superb compact 85mm lens , but this time they finally got it right . without doubt , this fine portrait lens photographing head-and-shoulder portraits ( only lens which optically better nikon legendary 105mm 2.5 nikkor lens , its close optical twin , 105mm 2.8 micro nikkor . ) . since 105mm 2.5 nikkor lens doesn't autofocus version , then this might perfect moderate telephoto lens owners nikon autofocus slr cameras . regardless , this lens well-earned reputation excellent contrast resolution	1
could not any simpler use . used it few times since it arrived it works flawlessly . +++ recommended all users . quicker easier than built charger zr700 camcorder	1
first i not this lens yet but i am buying it . it reportedly excellent lens very little distortion edges ( which why i'm buying it ) . i update this review after i lens , however , i feel people should warned big error well received review because it only lead frustration . not listen john kwok suggestion buy canon 60mm macro lens unless you you own 20d , 300d , or 350d/rebel xt . lens ef-s lens september , 2005 it only fit those cameras - it not optimized all canon dslr he states . other hand , 50mm macro here fit all canon 35mm film cameras all digital slr .	1

like most every canon accessory , 580ex well made very expensive . i cheaped out when i bought my digital rebel bought sigma ef-500 dg , which represented " almost good " canon 580ex . appears true . problem " almost " leaves me no master/slave lighting . so when i picked up eos 30d , i bit bullet paid big bucks canon . it works advertised nicely makes sigma slave it really born	1
580ex wonderful flash i would not hesitate buy it again . fact i might even buy second one . there however couple issues you should aware . 1 . battery compartment door takes little getting used . you may feel like you going snap it off first . not really big deal though . 2 . ( my opinion this big deal ) . `auto focus assist ' completely useless . its just led pointed through rather bad `lens ' . it won't anything past couple feet . laser diode diffraction grating would made it work far past useable flash distance this price canon should know better . all told however it wonderful flash . circular command dial make adjusting flash exposure easy ( dial more or less flash relative ambient light ) . if you not external flash get one . it makes huge difference . this great offering .	-1
i love this camera ! i bought it keep my diaper bag so i always camera me . it small , easy use takes great pictures . i recently sent few them developed they came out great . only recommendation i purchase larger memory card - one it comes only hold few pictures	1
i bought this camera $249 new which marked down $499 retail . this older model new models just come out . money this good camera , but i am very particular not blown away . images good , but i expecting more vibrance . colors bit weak . it not take focused shot indoors unless flash , flash way bright closer shots . image often over exposed , i find myself placing piece paper over flash get more correct shot . i upgraded canon a40 2 megapixel camera ( amazing camera ! ) , images very similar quality , except new sd500 captures them bigger , 7 megapixel chip , hence little better detail . i like small size , battery lasts long time charges . holds lots pictures 1 gig card i purchased seperatly . video quality quite good still camera .	-1
i not take more than one bags . this bag big enough everything .	1

question : canon s2 only 1 color - silver . i believe this telephoto converter came only black , doesn't it look silly silver camera long black nose ? i going get this adaptor but i am holding back because it color . instead , i am looking find adaptor converter kit comes silver instead black . although i don't this converter . assuming i am satisfied its quality featuers , i would only give it only 4.5 stars because it color . anyone any ideas	-1
hoods offer several benefits photographer . primarily hood shades lens stray light may result unwanted discoloration or hazing image , or appearance lens flare . shading your lens helps improve contrast image quality . hood not required eliminate these problems , any item used shade lens provide same protection stray light . hood convenient it built offer protection while ensuring it not inadvertently find its way into your image . photographers often state protective abilities hood reason one . this hood solid conical two inch long offers some protection keeping moisture wind blown debris off lens element . there nothing more irritating than reviewing your images find dust spots or other flaws . when place , hood protect lens impacting solid objects . replacing damaged hood usually cheaper than repairing or replacing lens . this hood manufactured canon 85 f/ 1.8 usm ef , 100 f/ 2.0 usm ef , 135 f/ 2.8 usm ef , 100-300 f/ 4.5 - 5.6 usm ef lenses normally not included lens when sold new . amazon often suggests purchasing one your lens , worth considering . since hood wider than lens ; it easily stored attached reverse position . this doesn't add length lens , but make it wider inch . inch may not seem like lot , but tightly packed camera bag , it huge . fortunately canon provides storage case lens used addition your camera bag . while protective benefits exist , they secondary limited . i find impact hood my image quality more convincing reason use hood . considering impact image quality low cost compared my other camera equipment ( except lens case ) , purchasing hood money well spent . pros : improves contrast image quality offers limited protection lens cons : takes up more space your camera bag store len	-1
what great little piece kit . it great my ef 70-200mm f/4l . only drawback you've no af . you forced use manual focus . now this isn't big problem , unless you're photographing wildlife or moving objects . well worth price though very useful	-1

i am new slrs i cant belive how good this camera . this camera worth every penny amazing quality it produces . i always thot my old digital pics point shoot excellent , but looking back , they look terrible compared this .	1
when i bought this camera sales people tried get me buy battery . they said one came it would only good 20 minutes . now i bought alot items my lifetime , 20 min battery camera just doesnt seem like very good " business " choice . so i said no . so i got camera , charged battery until light went green ( which sucked because i wanted play it right when i got it ) started taking pictures ( oh i also got 2g cf ) worked great .... so i planned go up mountain take soem scenery shots . keeping mind what sales person told me i pocketed charger just incase . well , 6000 ' , 300 pictures , 5 hours later camera still running strong , still 200 shots left trip home , battery life indicator hasnt budged off full button . so all all , i think battery life great , now i see if your taking say thousands pictures all row you may need but just going trip shooting few pictures every stop point , original work fine . quality photos ..... i love them	1
i bought remote control so i could trip shutter while my camera tripod . mostly landscape stuff . it works great my intended use . only minor problem you point remote control front camera . i found it works fine if i hold remote front , below lens ( out view lens )	-1

this camera amazing , i couldn't asked more . just warned manual pretty terrible . it best just play around camera until you figure it out , rather than wasting time trying decipher manual	1
walkaround lens . this very topic leads heated discussion among dslr photographers . first , determine your budget , focal length , aperture needs . if you frequently find yourself zooming out get everything frame , you want wide angle lens such this . if you frequently find yourself zooming , this not lens you . full frame body such canon eos 5d , this lens becomes ultra wide angle . aps-c crop body such digital rebel xti ( which i used this review ) , it becomes medium wide angle . but thanks 1.6 crop factor , this lens expands more usable 35mm equivalent focal length 27 64mm . second , audition lens if you . definition , walkaround lens should relatively portable . 1.1 lbs ., canon ef 17-40mm f/4l usm neither super light nor neck breakingly heavy . fact , it weighs almost same digital rebel xti -- really nice balance . lens feels very solid supreme build quality only l-series lenses offer . although this lens weather proof therefore sealed against liquid dust , i strongly recommend getting 77mm filter protect front lens element . it , this lens made last . terms looks feel , it doesn't get much better . its rubberized full-time inner focus manual ring usm focuses smoothly , quietly , quickly . since it inner focus , lens not extend beyond its metal casing whether you zoom or out . focus window shows focusing distance 0.28 meter ( 0.92 feet ) infinity . focal length marker indicates 17 , 20 , 24 , 28 , 35 , 40mm . lens exudes quality tip tip . you may tolerate heavier lens or may not mind lesser build quality cheaper lenses . walkaround lens used very often , so make sure you comfortable i t.t his lens famous saturated color deep contrast . its images simply stunning . 17mm wide angle , barrel distortion noticeable but relatively mild . 24mm 40mm , its images distortion free perfectly suited capturing people . vignetting ( corner darkness ) minimal mild chroma abberrations ( color shadows ) . f/4 aperture , details become noticeably softer toward edges . center region very sharp f/ 5.6 , edges remain fairy sharp . thanks 7 diaphragm blades , this lens produce very nice bokeh 40mm ( blur effects ) . one most cited weaknesses f/4 aperture . my experience , bump iso speed steady hands all you need take well focused images indoor . other hand , if you shooting very little amount light , you might wish f/ 2.8 or image stabilizer . although difference f/4 f/ 2.8 just 1 stop , my other lens , canon ef 24-70mm f/ 2.8 usm ( too heavy my walkaround lens ) easily outperforms such challenging situations . but large , i not handicapped f/4 aperture . some main competitions ( sorted price ): - sigma 18-50mm f/ 2.8 ex dc : arguably best wide angle lens limited budget . focus mechanism bit slow , corner very soft , chroma abberrations bit issue , lens highly prone flare . works only ef-s mount . - sigma af 17-70mm f/ 2.8 - 4.5 dc macro : bit more expensive than sigma 18-50mm , but wider focal range macro capability . - canon ef-s 17-85mm f/4- 5.6 usm : this " traveler lens " wider focal range than most wide angle lenses ( widest among canon ) equipped image stabilizer . but lens famous extreme barrel distortion 17mm chroma abberrations . works only ef-s mount . - tamron sp af 17-50mm f/ 2.8 di ii ld aspherical ( if ): this most direct competitor . it takes sharper images faster aperture while costing less . both build focus mechanism significantly worse , but should good enough many . works only ef-s mount . - canon ef-s 17-55mm f/ 2.8 usm : this reference , if you afford it . its images razor sharp details great performance all around ( minus vignetting , which typical ef-s lenses ) . build quality worse than l-series but not too shabby . works only ef-s mount . this best ef-s lens hands down . - canon ef 16-35mm f/ 2.8 usm : one most expensive wide angle zoom lenses . it larger heavier , but f/ 2.8 aperture . this how canon ef 17-40mm f/4 usm stacks up . pros : - among very best build quality . - excellent , buttery smooth , super fast front-focus system . - top notch color contrast . very sharp center resolution . - almost non-existent vignetting , generally low distortion , well controlled chroma abberrations . - ideal weight size walkaround purposecons : - edge softness f/4 aperture . - narrower focal length than most competing lenses . - slower than some third party lenses . all all , this excellent wide angle walkaround lens . it may not offer most bang buck , but if you value full frame compatibility ( ef lens mount ) excellent build quality , this default choice . this lens comes nice pouch lens hood . i find hood somewhat ridiculously shaped because lens resistant flare , i not use it often when shooting outdoor	1
this magnificent lens deserving high praise . general , i tend shoot " available light " towards wide angle , ef 17-40 f4l one perfect lens someone like me . aps size sensor camera ( mine rebel xt ) , it works approximately like 28-70 mm zoom -- perfect walk-around lens , giving you decent wide angle tele end , pleasing perspective faces you expect moderate telephoto . i spent two weeks ef 17-40 coast shooting nature street stuff small towns . it performed perfectly . but i only realized what real treasure i when i began second thoughts it eve long overseas journey . i asked myself whether i would not better buying ef-s 17-85 f4- 5.6 . after all , it gives you better reach - equivalent 28-135 mm zoom 35 mm camera . would it not perfect lens overseas trip ? dilemma worhty hamlet . so i decided order it amazon while i still time return ef 17-40 . soon ef-s 17-85 came , i some tests taking pictures still life , flowers portrait similar focal lengths full zoom . results put 17-85 shame . color light flat paled next 17-40 . but there still problem reach . i took portrait full zoom same person ( 40 mm or 65 mm equivalent 85 mm or 135 equivalent ) , cut out critical focus area both pix equalized two crops terms pixel numbers . unprocessed , 17-85 produced perfectly focused picture , 17-40 crop visibly softer , but terms tonality richness gradations , it way ahead its rival . photoshop rescue ! after i fiddled sharpening contrast cs2 , focus softness 17-40 gone , result better all-around picture same portrait detail . other words , if you wish take picture , say , building detail or monkey mug shot zoo -- situation calling telephoto 135 mm 17-85 capable -- ef 17-40 f4 job , fact better job terms textures tonality -- focus , too , if you little post-processing sc2 . i am returning ef-s 17-85 stick ef 17-40 , taking it my overseas trip . unlike ef-s 17-85 f4- 5.6 , which feels like decent consumer zoom , ef 17-40 f4l built like tank weather sealing . it should also come handy if when i decide switch full-frame camera ( ef-s lenses work only aps-size sensors ) .	1
i would not able imagine shooting without sb-800 , it just so integral my photography . my only gripe ttl preflashes which cause some people blink half-blink time main flash goes off . but you easily get around this using fv lock . fill flash perhaps most excellent function sb-800 . i usually stop it down - 1.3 ev - 1.7 ev get imperceptable results	1
bought it together d50 , 6 month ago . simply best choice digital nikon slr , superior compared high-end flashes analog nikon cameras . within range up 60feet this flash brighten very smooth , no red eyes , press focus perfectly . but you need 5th battery , you better spent money high-end batteries , don't use " consumer-type " rechargeable ones . they last very short time only , not enough fill 1gb card !	1
nice intermediate level flash , works great within its perameters	-1
all my life i seen myself especially babies some reason victim redeye . i bought this right before my son born taken nothing but beautiful pictures ever since haven't single red eye no matter how light someone eyes . great benefit/feature able bounce flash off ceiling or wall avoid ghost face ( go devil eye ) it takes beautiful pictures even dimly lit rooms without smidge graininess . ( see one two pictures my son indoors customer images this product ) we use this canon digital rebel xt	1
i get frustrated all negative reviews this lens gets web . yes , af slow first generation . yes , it not totally sharp it slow long end . but what other $440 ( inc shipping ) 300mm lenses there ? * costs $1100 shorter but heavier optics not much better . * 100-400l costs $1400 , much larger just slow . * 70-200/4l 50% more expensive , only 200mm lacks . * new 70-300 replaces this lens probably better lens than this version but it costs 50% more currently ( oct 05 ) still not available us . 75-300mm my zoo lens so i don't use it nearly much my standard zoom everyday photography . my digital rebel its 1.6 crop factor this lens equivalent 120-480mm 35mm terms , image stabilization feature it makes some exotic optics . play this lens ' strengths ( middle aperture range [ don't afraid higher iso settings achieve this ] not extreme long end ) your images able printed 8x10 without issue . you're not going able easily track speeding cheetah this lens but not what this lens . it also unfair compare this lens series alternatives - if you afford series lenses then use them but don't cut those us down without your disposable income just enjoying this lens . if you own this lens you want improve quality your images remember always use lens hood . also , amazing but there limits ; monopod improve image sharpness no end . but both these tips apply equally most lenses both cheaper more expensive . this lens earned permanent place my camera bag . it cheap enough light enough carry just case you might need strong telephoto . really works really useful telephoto this kind zoom range . don't put off or intimidated lens snobs line counters . this lens also holds its value well ; buy it , use it , now while you're saving your dream telephoto you able sell it not much less than you paid it when time comes upgrade . when time comes you just might decide you want keep 75-300mm around well . this lens great value very useable even if it not great lens .	-1
i cannot help but giggle when i saw comments like " great lens money " . it selling $440 here , even so-called clearance . however , one easily find same lens least $50 cheaper some decent online camera store , such bh , ritz camera , etc . sad amazon ..	-1
you know , i researched this lens again again . i put it my christmas list . year half went i finally just bought it . my gosh , everything true ! this one world great lenses . what piece glass . image stabilization i take candid shots candlelit restaurant using available ligh t.t he lens magical . it captures soul its subjects . nature photography phenomenal . this incredible tool take you new level . just it ! no regrets . honest .	1
best camera i've ever owned . it features found larger slr such shutter speed red-eye reduction . several shoot modes such portrait allows close ups well scenery mode which allows sharp vivid photos foilage well sunsets . marvelous little camera size slightly bigger than pack cigarettes allows you take this anywhere without bulk some slr their required lens . too many features list here . try one yourself you'll amazed	-1
i bought this camera my 10 year old daughter . she thrilled her own camera taken may vacation pics family . i would reccommend all beginning photographers . great price range all options . plus easy use	-1
lens fulfilled all our expectations quality portraits field view flexibility . stabilization aspect great help , although it doesn't compensate someone pushing shutter too fast low light conditions . highly recommend this lens standard use lens canon rebel xt	1
this lens very versatile , offering good wide angle good head-and-shoulders portrait length . it internal focusing , which helps speed close-focusing performance , image stabilizer better low-light performance . particular benefit those shoot darker open areas , like wedding photographers churches . , combined flash , allow use get more background detail indoor events . no longer we accept dark , dungeon like backgrounds ! ideally , lens would little bit brighter ( say , f4 top end ) , bit heavier built . but then again , we could $ 1,000 more	-1
i bought 2 these carry camera support suspended over treadmill filming above . i love fact they extend 70 " . they very sturdy hook central post i could hang sandbag additional support . furthermore , support beams each leg central post attached central ring tighten change size base support measured distance legs tripod . this extremely helpful when you limited floor space tight or cramped corners . addition sandbags , this narrow base support still quite stable . additional bubble levels stand enormously helpful rough terrain . locking mechanims legs plastic , however thus not very good outdoor , dusty conditions . they very much like samsonite 3751 same camera release mechanism , locking legs , bubble levels , extendable center post , changeable size base suppor t--t he differences : cheaper , greater extension , hook center post , carrying case	1
i little hesitant purchase this tripod because low price . last cheap tripod i bought lightweight wobbly . i am very pleased performance this tripod . i wasn't expecting bogen type quality , but its good enough . it lightweight , surprisingly sturdy . i would recommend this tripod friend	1
okay , lot said saving money , however there problems no-name or non-branded products . no matter what your " style " photography , you battery empty its charge critical moment . back-up essential . quality back-up battery get you through imperative . knock-off brands not hold same charge branded battery meant your camera ; although their manufacture may claim it . get zone get shot !	1
this excellent battery powers my canon 5d camera very well . although i haven't tested it against spec how many shots i get it , i've very impressed longevity it charge	1
i know it sounds too good true , i've read too many reviews where people say " i never knew how i ever took pictures without this grip , " but it truth . first thing i noticed vertical handle , it amazing . you shoot vertical shots one hand ! all buttons you need grip , shutter button , wheel , two buttons top right xt . installation , it joke , don't even read manual . you charge batteries , but mean time you put your regular canon battery , or 6 aas because this comes aa shell . think it this way , xt baby ... it easy hold if you small hands ; i don't , i knew camera small , i decided buy this really so i could better handle it , extra battery life whipping cake . i really don't know how i could stand hold camera without this grip . don't spend extra money canon model , this one perfect	1
i read rave reviews opteka battery grip manufactured same specs canon grip but fraction price , so i knew i couldn't go wrong it . it came two 3rd party batteries well only $20 more , so what i lose ? let me start off saying i experience 3rd party batteries they usually waste money they horrible performance standpoint . not these however , i taken few hundred pictures 20% flash battery meter still full . great value overall . grip really balance out small size rebel xt always stays my camera . it add considerable weight camera however , but nothing overbearing	1
i lens , i cap .... its so long since i bought both i don't remember if cap came lens or not . surely it !!!!!!! i love my add lenses but i say now i've added all these other toys ( macro , wide angle , telephoto , filters ) i now realize i shouldve gotten slr digital held out true lenses instead conversion option . i love my s2is but just think how nice real camera would !!!!!! sigh ...	1
i'd stating obvious preaching choir if i said care lenses slr cameras required decent lens cap . this one snaps into 58mm threads end many lenses ( canon otherwise ) , so just sure confirm it proper size your lens	-1
i am very pleased this item . size right , resolution photos perfect . i am enjoying using camera	1
i almost didn't buy this camera simply because plastic body ( i'm used praktica mtl3 film camera , which built like tank ) . however , i'm glad i overlooked because camera top-notch terms robust features quality it provides . startup time very quick making adjustments shutter speed aperture intuitive . if you get bundle kit lens , i highly recommend complimenting it very affordable canon ef 50mm f/ 1.8 ii lens , especially if you big fan dof lot available-light / low-light photography .	1
i love new digital canon . only problem it not nearly tough it film twin . i camera less than month when pop-up flash quit working . canon people great , very helpful , but i'd rather not send brand new camera back factory . photos , however , wonderful . film quality most part - printable enlargable . ( it would probably better use camera tripod when using 300mm telephoto but i hike it , so just remember steady it before taking wildlife photos .	-1
i 2 rebel cameras so it just made sense me pick up this digital camera attach my old lenses . while i owned other digitals i keep going back my old rebel , until now . we got back up battery pack . my husband i love it	1
i gave this monopod my boyfriend , gift , it perfect his use . he videotapes his kids baseball softball games , tired holding camcorder so long . he didn't want deal bulky tripod when he getting up down , so monopod seemed like great idea . he loved it !! he says it keeps camera very steady it very easy change height so he use it sitting or standing . he no professional , but he uses his camcorder lot , he'll happily using monopod long time	1
i love this monopod ! i'm person who uses my camera nearly every day ( canon eos elan 7 35mm ) . this item one my favorite accessories camera -- so much easier travel than tripod ! it sturdy , but lightweight , easy use very portable . i am mostly using monopod support my camera enormous , extremely heavy 500mm telephoto lens attached . i'm actually able hold huge lens steady just monopod -- not one blurry photo ! i've dragged it all over bluegrass kentucky ... across fields horse farms , even racetrack . i've taken it out into wilderness photograph elk . i keep closing it down extending it out every time we got out vehicle , which often . also recently traveled all over arizona it grand canyon , monument valley , canyon de chelley , etc . i constantly opening closing it , taking literally hundreds photos ( 14 rolls ) no problems all . i'm wondering if other reviewer just got defective one . i wish i'd bought one these years ago ! i highly recommend it	1
i forgot my wife birthday she subsequently hinted she wanted telephoto lens ... i started looking cheap ones , but decided , i might well it right if i going it all . when it arrived , my wife took it out box we both stunned how massive this lense . it heavier than you might think well ( which means mounting ring come packaged this lens absolute god-send ) . first thing we go out buy mono-pod it . next we took it camping then water-skiing ended up some most incredible , crystal clear shots we've ever seen . autofocus incredibly fast - i able hold down button snap through multiple exposures while speeding across waves . most time - thing right . we then mounted it tri-pod shot family portraits . this first time we all kids grandkids together six years once again - lens didn't let us down photos fantastic . i don't any real training camera ( i use cannon rebel auto-focus most time ) but this lens worth every dime . ... it also worked get me out dog-house my wife ..	1
i keep it short sweet . very sharp - quick autofocus . i use it my canon 20d .	1
it performs you'd expect . bar holds paper place , cutter cuts paper . i also got perforating scoring blades , those also work very well . using cutter perforator , i've made several custom-size notebooks tear-out pages	1
when digital cameras first came out , i , like many people swore i'd always loyal film . digital could never take place film . i'm not convinced it replaced film completely . there still something i love putting roll film camera , shooting away , sending film processed , seeing results . i also know it bit expensive . i know argument quality always paramount discussion , but digital cameras improving this regard , most manufacturers assuring users while technology always improving , we point where good investment made digital slr it not outdated soon buyer purchases camera . so i figured now time get digital slr . i loyal nikon user nearly ten years , owned nikon n60 , n70 , n80 . my first love , still n70 ( i've told person who sold me camera he thought i only person who loved n70 ) . i purchased n80 only after my n70 cost too much repair , but i've enjoyed way my various nikon cameras handled all sorts situations fact they simple use point shoot if i don't time use specific controls , but it also options more creative artistic purposes . my nikon cameras allowed me capture family moments ease majestic landscapes , wildlife shots all sorts other things i can't resist capture forever . i decided purchase d70 since it close what i've already experienced nikon . many ways it works similar way n70 80 , except it digital rather than film version . like film versions midrange nikon slr , it dial allows automatic setting , portrait , landscape , sports , close-up , nightscape , night portrait modes , ability select aperture , shutter speed or manual controls . camera auto manual focus abilities . photos easy or technical photographer desires . controls easy use , though it takes practice comfortable . personal level , camera passed halloween test , niece birthday test , fall foliage new england test favorite scenic spots test . only real difficulty i've camera trying capture stained glass windows dark setting . auto focus not worked all i'm not thrilled manual focus these shots , but this point i'm sure it photographer not camera . i one suggestion anyone who purchases this camera . manual very confusing . it uses all sorts symbols more distraction than anything else . i've luck " magic lantern guides " my other cameras , but not yet used it this camera . i purchase nikon d70 field guide ( david busch , wiley publishing ) which helpful . it quick reference anyone already familiar nikon photography general but it also provides introduction novice photography .	1
i weddings , portrait , outdoor photography i don't see any reason why i'd ever switch d70 ( other than d80 :) . this camera professional grade consumer price point . don't scared 6.1 mp . i print 20x30 all time w/ out any problems . i'd recommend reading thom hogans manual	1
it learning curve , that sure , but wow ! this camera worht every penny , far more stable then comparable canon rebel , product comes better lenses . quality glass matter	1
i just attached my battery grip my 300d first time today , difference amazing . i already extra battery pack , so i charged them both up slid them right away . added weight very nice addition 300d small body , i already see improvement my ability hold camera still . it also makes camera feel much sturdier . i seen few reviews complain fitting . i not problem . connection seemless me , there no shimmy what-so-ever when i 70-300 lens attached camera tripod . so maybe this accessory optimized xt ? i love extra shutter button well , it makes taking picture portrait orientation extremely comfortable easy . buttom almost exactly same actual shutter camera well , which makes it easy go button button . after reading all hype this accessory , i forced myself buy it , i not dissapointed ! i recommend it anyone using xt . buy it now or else	1
recycle times fantastic . batteries seem last forever . much less expensive than alternatives	1
i'm using cpe3 my 20d 580ez . i'm shooting over 500 wedding flash shots before i notice any slow down recyle time . recycle 3 seconds after full discharge hardley noticeable anything less . i am using " digital " brand 2200 mah ni-mh batteries . pack uses 8 batteries recharge flash capicitor while 4 batteries flash running flash electronics . i am very happy this combination . way i'm using stroboframe pro-rl flash bracket it great . battery pack cpe3 straps right bracket	-1
i love ef 70-200 f/4l usm telephoto zoom lens . price right , super quality pictures color contrast . it light weight 1.5 pounds comparing its siblings , 70-200 f/ 2.8 or without ( 3.5 pounds ) . i am think buy new model 70-200 f/4l . , i take pictures lower light conditions , which i could not it my 70-200 f/4l .	1
this great lens , amazingly sharp . only thing i would say if i money 2.8 version would even better certainly something i'll consider upgrade future . use fast shutter speed or mono/tripod this thing . anything below 250/sec gets problem 200mm	1
i agree previous review . deluxe blower brush just left more dirt camera because hair brush falling out	-1
this lens great . i've doing portraits just random snapshots it makes every picture beautiful ! only downside lack ability zoom . other than it great lens	-1
this awesome lense , especially money . i would still purchase this one . there nothing second rate it . however , canon new series version their website photo . it 50 mm normal ef f/ 1.2 usm 1599 . 00 . i heard photographers who shoot whole weddings this one 3 hundred dollar lens 50mm lens .	1
sure , this isn't pro mono pod it doesn't mobile head but money it great . easily holds my olympus e1 50-200mm lens . great walking stick well . stores tight light . highly recommend this product . i may just get back up	-1
mp100 served us well since getting it 2 months ago . like other reviewers , i wasn't expected whole lot after disappointed $40 monopod made those well under 6 feet tall . quite stable , usable walking stick , easier reset height than competition under $50 twist-lock legs . this monopod definitely exceeded my expectations ! seems niche here higher priced version pan/tilt head , but i 30yr old leica table top tripod pan/tilt head combination works great ! balance , can't beat even if all you order mp100 pay $6 or so s/h ! use beach or where dirt grit air , you'll want wipe down legs before collapsing ( cloth used gun storage work great ) or you may grit legs scratching mp100 legs subsequent use .	1
great affordable camera , takes very nice pictures .	1
bought p880 month ago . i am sem-pro outdoor adventure photographer i use nikon 35mm film equipment most part . i shoot slide film my f90s nikon . i 5mp kodak digital camera but wanted upgrade better digital camera but i could not justify buying nikon d50 or d70s they only 6mp . i didn't want drop 2 grand d200 . so i looked mid-range camera lines . after doing much research , i decided buy this camera . so far i am happy i . i taken it hiking several times , enough i know its good camera but course its toy compared pro nikon film cameras . but i knew when i bought it . i wanted good camera take lots " documentary " , " fun " " travel " shots . really powerful stuff i still shoot slide film . but its too expensive shoot extensively!here my initial impressions based perspective outdoor photosgrapher : good : 1 ) fairly easy hold its tall actual grip . 2 ) lightweight ( but course expense impact resistance i'm sure ... ) 3 ) great set manual controls ! this best part . autobracket good interval timer which great self-potraits . you walk far away camera get yourself shot ( great solo hikers ) . 4 ) large 2.5 " lcd makes it easy check out your photos5 ) image quality seems pretty good ( although not comparable high-res . scan slide ) . 6 ) manual zoom great ! much better than power zooms almost all other cameras . 7 ) 24mm focal length simply amazing ! great landscapes outdoor adventure shots . 8 ) battery life great . shot 250 or so pics full charge included lot playing around menus , reviewing photos , etc . i just boughta second kodak battery amazon $16 ! 9 ) built flash pretty powerful you add shoe mount unit well . 10 ) 8mp resolution price 6mp camera . not so good : 1 ) seems write card pretty slowly . definately not action shots ! maybe this would improve if i bought faster sd card . 2 ) " toggle " button back navigating through menues worries me . seems like it could break someday . i am gentle it . wish they would create more durable feeling toggle . 3 ) lcd viewfinder hard see bright sunny day . this where film camera way better . optical viewfinders cannot beat . 4 ) screen manual focus no good all . better just focus your eyes . 5 ) wish they would made handgrip little grippier adding rubber stip or like . little slippery hands ( always use neck strap ! )in all i highly recommend this camera . if they improve upon some items which i some critisism , i would easily give this camera perfect review !! good luck your purchas	-1
i got this lens shooting architecture distance -- unsual application . i've also found myself using it shoot kids soccer games . it super sharp very fast focusing . i haven't formal tests all apertures , but images appear vivid contrasty range settings . online reviews rank this lens very highly my own experience supports those findings . image stabilization seems work very well , although sure turn it off if you're using tripod--i've found it reduce image quality if you forget turn it off application . shots where you'll standing around lot lens your eye , ready shot , it gets kind heavy carry . if you're shooting sports , you might want consider monopod . other applications , its weight low enough not too big problem . it comes canvas-like case includes loop you use attach it your belt . i've found this works pretty well out field , particularly when combined photo-vest . case also carried neck strap , but this gets way your camera strap also thin , so it kind cuts into your shoulder . i write this , amazon site link 58mm filters this lens . it takes 77mm filters	1
this battery backwards compatible d50 , d70/70s , used d80 d200 . so if you any nikon dslr want second battery , you want get this one so when you upgrade your camera you use battery . this battery built-in circuitry tells you actual charge status battery , it accurate . this big deal ; * if you using d200 or d80 * it lets you know when your really need switch batteries or charge up . this first battery i've seen accurate this regard . kudos nikon . ( this feature not work d50/70/70s but battery otherwise works fine )	1
i owned canon 10d but could never get used " cropped " view limited sensor . i barely used camera over 3 yrs ownership , preferring shoot my film nikon . 5d , full field view back . " sweep " one feel framing picture through this camera just marvelous . images ( " " lenses ) just stupendous . arguably better than film . this first camera less than $6000.00 every bit good film . i highly recommend it if you serious amatuer or professional photographer	1
if you've considering digital full frame camera ( who hasn't ? ) this one doesn't cost arm leg . now kodak out picture , your choices eos 5d or 1ds mark ii , which costs more than twice much . you give up few things , such super-fast frame rate continuous shooting , but 5d resolution you need top-quality images , ability get true wide angle perspectives your ef lenses . i happened shoot this camera concert side-by-side vendor " " camera , both under available light 85mm f/ 1.8 lenses range isos . i found some shots i liked other camera , shot iso 400 , comparable shots 5d which , my surprise , turned out exposed iso 3200 . 5d absolutely lives up its low noise reputation . but don't take my word it , try one out yourself	1
just got 5d .. traded my 20d ... 5d more solid camera full frame sensor ... pictures great it easy use if you familiar canon system ... little pricey , but worth it !! you'll use it years	1
price , this excellent lens . aps sized sensor it equivalent 480mm long end . some complain it slow lense since max aperture full zoom 5.6 just means you can't use it low light expect great results . if you want fast lense length , however , prepared pay lot money . usm it focuses very fast . works well outdoor sports . my rating based what you get money . course it not good glass but it way less money	1
there no professionals or would-be professional photographers our house . instead we ametuers who love get fun shots our friends family . we're not particularly interested birds , flowers , bugs , race cars , etc . we want catch our kids doing what they love best ; football , basketball , swimming , band , golf ... my only advantage i am very experienced adobe photoshop , which lets me creatively salvage some less-than-perfect shots . this year our son high-school senior . instead buying expensive portrait package , we voted spend money canon digital rebel xt kit ( lens ) . we choose one extra zoom lense ( 75-300mm f4- 5.6 iii usm telephoto ) up-close action sports shots . we didn't chose lens because it out our price range . we great fun this camera lens . we already taken variety football game pictures using ' basic ' sports setting camera ( burst mode full zoom ) . they great - crisp clear . these taken full sun . we realize we'll get little more creative when we taking pictures lower light situations . but i think we it . i would recommend this lens anyone who just wants capture some fun shots . they might not professional quality , but they just what we wanted	1
i recently purchased this lens 24-105mm part fall cash cannon rebate program . so , originally , my main reason get this lens because it would save me $50 off other lens via doubling rebates make it pretty cheap . but now i used it awhile , i am really happy i got it . 1.8 maximum aperture two things really well , lets you take low-light handheld shots isolates subject . see my example photos examples both these features . i use this canon rebel xt rebel xti which 1.6 crop factor make this lens more like 135mm which good bad depending your usage . this lens produces very sharp results doesn't weigh much , so it easy carry around . if you already good range zoom lenses looking something just take really nice , sharp , handheld shots , consider this lens	1
i am really impressed results i get this lens . this my first usm lens 85mm new me . it serves me really well taking people pictures outside - fantastic background blur fast enough low light indoor close ups . full time manual focus handy too times . my tamron 17-50 , this lens great combo me	1
answer most likely yes ; since its price make it best value fast canon prime lens . but before you make $350 plunge here few useful things know how it used . keep mind i use this lens rebel xt ( 1.6 factor ) , which means it provides me angel view similar 135mm film cameras . sharpness : yes that one feature you count when buying this lens . this lens produces very sharp pictures . so much so it blow away your 18-55 kit lens ( if you one ) all other zoom lenses . exception l-series zooms . sharpness difference obvious even smallest prints ( 4 6 ) . if you can't envision such difference then consider this . sharpness viewed contrast edges different color objects . hence , sharper image greater contrast edges such groups color . this lens captures contrast such setting better than most other lenses . speed : this lens blazingly fast . such you opportunity shoot higher shutter speeds wide open ( remember inverse relation aperture shutter speed ) . more importantly you gain ability shoot low light situations ( concert example ) still maintain decent shutter speed handholding . here best part , if you're like most new people photography , you probably plan take self portraits . this lens give you ability , you able buy few clamp lights coupled 100-150w bulbs start shooting medium iso speeds wide open . angel view : assuming you using this lens 1.6 digital format consider you tight crop , more like 135mm lens film camera ( 1.6 *85 = 136 ) . what translate practical terms ? you stand 6-8 feet away your subject able cover their head shoulders landscape orientation . special effects : here two special effects you find useful this lens depth field compression . some degree or every lens offers depth field , which summarize only subject interest focus rest picture blurred . this lens unique it creates very shallow depth field which subject truly isolated whole scene . set aperture 1.8 focus correctly you achieve such results . more importantly lens quality such blur ( known bokeh ) outstanding there eight diaphragm blades control aperture opening vs . 5 or 6 many other lenses . compression , since camera telephoto it compress everything its sight closer together fit its sight . example , if you photographing person , their face look wider their nose look smaller or flatter . keep mind unlike some longer telephoto lenses ( 300mm example ) effect this lens subtle pleasant size build : its size weight perfect ! it balances my xt very nicely . so much so , i take pictures very low shutter speeds this combination ( though i don't find my self doing often this fast lens ) . all this translates comfort confidence when i am shooting this lens . build quality excellent , i find no inherit weakness design . if you plan photograph friends family then this lens . you take sharp pictures right kind effects portraits like compression beautiful bokeh . lens fast designed excellently maximum control comfort . you won't miss shot because shake slow shutter speeds even if you ( that big if ) you put its speed use dialing higher aperture . it only draw back it pretty tight angel view 1.6 factor slrs . i can't think any other prime non-l canon line up matches this lens ( other than possibly 50mm 1.4 ) . truly incredible value , buy it confidence ! ps . no means this review cover all merits this lens . name couple , lens offers precise auto focus low chromatic aberration . rather , i covered features most useful its intended purpose ; taking pictures people .	1
i bought this monopod after reading reviews here . it really light-weighted . i used it take pictures dance performace where tripod not possible . i able use slow shutter got great images . cons : i saw pro ( i knew he runs studio ) using similar monopod which black . so my only complain its non-black color . well i am not pro anyway .	1
fast delivery , great price . i would buy them again , thanks =	1
it works just like one comes camera . comes little plastic bag	-1
this essential part digital picture taking . can't download pictures your kodak camera onto computer without it . it should come standard your camera purchase , but if you misplaced yours , this one get . arrived promptly ordered value great	1
after reviewing my options purchase my new canon a540 we chose this case i'm glad i ! nice snug fit camera , extra compartments memory card batteries , no need strap , you already provided one camera .	1
i want protect my lens . while not most expensive , canon adequate what i nee	-1
works designed , performs well intended lens , construction plastic though	1
i received my 28-200 yesterday amazon . read customer reviews , i immediately put my rebel xt tripod ran two series comparison shots 28-200 my canon 28-135 . three shots each f-stops 5.6 , 11 , 20 , one set indoors iso 1600 other outdoors iso 200 . focal length 135 using same scenes each camera , highest jpeg setting . after shooting both series , i compared them fresh out camera , side side . results : 28-200 least sharp 28-135 both foreground background most instances . it visibly sharper iso 200 f-stops 5.6 20 , ( 28-135 took honors f-stop 10 ) , 20 , it visibly sharper both foreground background . 28-135 one-stop faster shutterwise . both lenses produced pictures which would sharpen nicely photoshop . there vagaries autofocus different shooting conditions consider ; different test scenes conceivably produce different results . my conservative conclusion : 28-200 good it gets super-zoom your canon ( unless you going drop $2200 series 28-300 carry it ) , 28-135 no clear sharpness advantage . these lenses , its tradeoff --- extra 65 mm focal length ( 105 mm after 1.6 conversion ) versus image stabilization low-light shooting capability . both lenses focus quickly silently , both lenses produce usable shots .	-1
i found this lens resonable all around lens , although when it comes portaits or close-ups i would recomend canon 100mm f/ 2.8 macro . if your looking camera use it i would highly recomend canon 10d wow	-1
i needed more reach than 400mm gave my eos 1d , so i purchased canon 500mm f/4l three years ago . it incredibly sharp out corners f/4 . bird mammal portraits , you see every feather , every hair . lens light enough use wimberley sidekick . some claim able handhold it , but i think its eight-plus pound weight bit much . i carry mine long lens case backpack harness kinesis gear . this lens ' image stabilization works very well . i've used it tripod one-second shutter speeds good telephoto technique , gotten sharp , publishable images . eos 1d or 1ds , lens camera rain-proof mild storms . i also got mine through adorama , no problem delivery or post-sale advertising . if you buy one expensive long lens wildlife , choose this one .	1
after noting captions exceptional photographs appeared nature photography magazines often shot this lens , i began read reviews . based uniformly excellent reviews , i bought this lens spent two weeks this january florida everglades taking pictures birds . based upon my experience lens , i would rate this second sharpness contrast only 300 mm 2.8 canon series lens . lens handholdable short periods shoot birds flight , but it best suited use solid tripod wimberley tripod head allow tracking birds flight	1
i delighted quality pictures i get this lens . autofocus fast quiet , while manual focus very solid smooth . i'm finally taking pictures worthy jewelry my partner creates	1
this fantastic lens not only macro shots but portraits too . extra distance allows far more flexibility when out . tried both 50 , 60 100mm - i'm glad i went 100mm	1
i spend most my time photographer taking macro photographs flowers other small things nature . i chose this lens over canon 50mm macro 100mm macro two reasons : ( 1 ) it constructed higher quality ud glass , so it great color contrast , it incredibly sharp all f/stops , ( 2 ) 180mm , it allows you stay farther away your subjects still focus 1:1 . this makes it easier take photographs without disturbing your subjects it allows you smaller , more blurry area background so background doesn't compete subject attention . lens also comes tripod color , which allows you conveniently change vertical horizontal , it adds stability your lens better balanced your tripod . lens ultrasonic motor , so it fast quiet when focusing , though i highly recommend setting focus limiter 1.5 m-infinity when not shooting macro photography . it speed up time it takes lens focus . only drawback i find lens it constructed only 8 blade aperture diaphram . theoretically , higher number blades , it would allow more natural blurs , but i say i've never noticed problem my photographs	1
i am new slrs i cant belive how good this camera . this camera worth every penny amazing quality it produces . i always thot my old digital pics point shoot excellent , but looking back , they look terrible compared this .	1
it extremely easy use . hard figure out menu , but once there no problem . takes beautiful pictures . great action shots well . seldom find blurry photo it stabelizer built	1
i love , love , love this camera . if you teens house watchout !, they'll definitely want this camera . it easy use well worth money . when my camera arrived , i amazed how small compact it . i let my son check it out first within no time we both using it . i really love movie feature . you record anywhere everywhere sound excellent . my last camera only recorded , but didn't any sound . it nothing compared this sony . 8.1 mega pixels makes pictures come out great . my sons i love it . they record all time take numerous pictures . i also like it internal memory , so if you don't memory stick yet , you still take pictures . 2.5 inch screen perfect . it makes it so easy get good shot all time . i no problems this purchase all . only thing i would recommend sony make something would protect 2.5 inch screen getting scratches , just like they optical lens . it always closed covered when its not use . but besides small detail there , sony great investment . i definitely buy sony again , especially when i decide update or if i'm looking gift give .	1
i bought this camera several weeks ago test-driven it forest preserves chicago upper michigan . it terrific job . i am artist who studied film school yet never used digital camera . i wanted something kind point shoot slr . i wanted some manual functions fool around , yet i also wanted easy shot family photos such . i didn't want start my digital experience expensive slr , so this proved great buy me . it very small compact yet very powerful .	1
unlike some other reviewers , i've no problems this battery ... i've it over year . i'm pro photographer , so it recharged over over over still holds charge . maybe it better because i tend totally drain my batteries before recharging ? i also use this battery dual battery grip alongside canon other off brand batteries	1
super lightweight , sharp wide open , short minimum focus distance , fast af . decent bokeh . ability take pictures very low light , super cheap when compared it 35mm 1.4 $1000+ brother 1.6 digital its normal lens see some shots : http://www.pbase.com/2bruce/gillin	1
this set basic filters must every camera bag ... even new slr users find them easy use they enhance your pictures - without doubt	1

this bag year now love it . this what i carry main compartment : nikon d50 18-200mm lens attached . wide angle 10-20mm lensdepending where i'm going - either d50 charger , speedlight other little accessories or my canon sd550 elph its charger . top compartment holds extra batteries , cleaning supplies filters . small zipper compartment flap little bit tight anything other than cleaning cloth , extra memory , id's/credit cards . cons : woman ... strap isnt all flattering going diagonally across front , but i usually carry it sort " 1/2 slung " position or fully around front anyway ( unless i'm hiking ) . it could little snug inside if you trying carry alot accessory items . would liked see padded portion main strap little longer so padding still shoulder when bag front slung position ( since i carry it way alot ) . pros : compact yet perfect fit my camera body , 2 lens , accessories . very snug secure back - easily hike , ride bike or even horse without fear . no trouble getting used " slinging " it around front . actually use bag kind shelf stabilizing elbows while composing shot . superior lowepro design - great quality , sturdy zippers , love rain cover . note : i try slingshot 200 version 1st found it just too big my needs so exchanged it this smaller version - no regrets , cant imagine i'll ever need bag .	1
just got slingshot 100 my nikon d50 kit lens . previously , i bought nikon bag but this just bag fit camera nothing else , i found this unpractical . d50 fits perfectly slingshot 100 , though i readjust velcro camera compartment dividers first . this quite disappointing i almost no free space my camera compartment anymore ! i guess canon 350d , which smaller body , fit this bag better . anyway i no other lenses yet ( 18-200 still order ) so all my gear ( battery , memory cards etc . ) finds place this bag . bag fits very well , comfortable well-made . before buying though , check if your camera lens fit	-1

works advertised . i use it extensively environmental work where i want remain short distance my camera . it great portraits where i am near concentrating my subject shoot remotely without losing contact model . remote also came handy several self-promotions where i seated seating myself office atmosphere .	1
this great lens joy use .... keep mind min 1:6 sensors 160mm so you limited respect . would nice if you could see lens settings like focus range preset view finder . don't like fact lens hood not mark show where it installed quickly .. not bad using logo indicator normal use , but always problems putting it back reversed put away . other hoods small dot etc help line it up . this lens grip double batteries get your attention after days shooting it . good news ... when you take it off you feel you pocket camera weight . i posted some action/panning shots this lens there didn't seem any others . couple aircraft couple auto racin	1
i shoot canon 20d used canon ef 75-300mm f/ 4.5 - 5.6 iii usm lens . i've always noticed limitations this lens when shooting amateur softball . i reviewed lens lineup canon website decided canon ef 100-400mm f/ 4.5 - 5.6 usm lens . even so , i apprehensive push/pull zoom system . since this lens seems so expensive , i wanted try it before i bought it . after renting lens using it over weekend softball tournament , i knew this right lens me . this serious lens meant serious photographers . lens , there lot more features manufactured better materials . construction sturdy consists 17 elements 14 groups . fluorite super ud-glass elements largely eliminate secondary spectrum . this lens compatible extenders 1.4 ii 2x ii . canon ef 100-400mm lens weighs 3 lbs/ 1,380 , accepts 77mm filters . sure get good quality uv haze filter . white , this lens looks bit strange , but helps keep it cool when using sun . some people concerned white , it attracts attention criminals . my experience , my 20d attracts attention regardless what lens i put it . i personally doubt thief looking something steal taking time evaluate cost item more concerned ease taking something they unload . i try make things difficult would thieves insurance back up . dual system two modes . mode 1 stationary subjects while mode two moving subjects . it recommended function not used tripod ; however i used it my monopod success . helps eliminate camera shake helps stabilize lens when shooting moving vehicle . while there limitations what , it give you couple extra stops . just keep mind , attempts eliminate camera movement , not movement subject photographed . this lens permits auto or manual focus depending how switch set . there also switch shift 1.8 m/ 5.9 ft infinity or 6.5 m/ 21.3 ft infinity . zooming this lens takes little time get used if you never used it before . once it gotten used , it seems much faster than typical twist zooming . resistance ring used tighten or loosen resistance zooming . this allows practically locking zoom place or providing no resistance all . zooming simple pulling or pushing lens its name sugges t.t he push/pull system causes air noticeably pushed around . because air pushed into camera , there myth lens causes dust settle accumulate digital camera sensors . i mostly use this lens one dirtiest environments i shoot amateur softball pictures . even so , my experience not support myth . i not seen any evidence support myth any reputable source either . included this lens tripod mount , lens hood , storage case . tripod mount best option use when mounting tripod . this helps balance load . mounting camera instead creates unbalanced set up may topple over . case zippered soft case ( lz1234 ) also purchased separately . lens hood ( et-83c ) used reduce lens flare protect front element certain situations . canon ef 100-400mm such awesome lens , it almost fails compare canon ef 75-300mm . clarity sharpness incredible . auto-focus quiet quick . features add creative versatility . canon ef 100-400mm comes price , but it worth every bit it . now i both lenses , canon ef 75-300mm no longer used . pros : incredible clarity sharpness quiet quick auto-focus features add creative versatility dual system cons : heavy bulky ( this should expected these types lenses	1
i very happy this camera bag . slingshot design works well makes unloading equipment far less cumbersome than traditional backpack . i also like features bag . it all great lowepro niceties like protective sewn-in cloth cover sensitive camera viewer before you zip it up , waterproof covering unexpected downpour compartments digital memory cards . it good buy	1
this bag very spacious stylish . it holds my rebel xt my three lenses very well . i even hold 70-200mm f/4 there , although it bit snug . best part this bag it completely customizable . i set it up such way i get any one my lenses just slinging bag around unzipping only top compartment . this very useful when you don't want constantly set your bag floor access your equipment . i one complaint . when wearing this bag sling , it sit your right shoulder . i am more used bags sitting my left shoulder , so take some getting used . when i carry this " non-sling " mode ( i.e. not over my head ) , it comfortably sit my left shoulder . however , best most unique feature this bag ability it sling around access camera without taking bag off , which only possible if i wear it sling bag my right shoulder . it would nice if portion bag customizable well	-1
this uv filter it job protect lens well . build solid ( metal construction ) . glass also descent quality . performance , it absorbs some uv light . uv light absorbtion hardly noticeable , probably sky 1-a haze filter version absorb more uv light than this lens which fine me . now , one problem which internal reflection . i've heard many people say it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out it not caused directly low light/night situation . internal reflection appear when there strong/bright source light comparison overall exposure ( surrounding environment ) . put it example ( which hopefully easier understand ) , when you take picture lamp during nightime light much brighter than surrounding area then you see internal reflection . you move position light closer sides/corner picture ( not center picture ) , internal reflection reduces finally dissapear ( if you move light far enough center ) . if light isn't too bright/contrast compare surrounding environment then there no internal reflection . but course most time , lamp nightime often very bright . but point i'm trying make internal reflection doesn't happen all time during low light or night time . additionally , internal reflection isn't only happening night . it also happen afternoon if you taking picture sun example . basically same rule above , how bright light source compared surrounding area , you move sun center photo near side internal reflection move side/dissapear ( also depending angle ) . but best way just remove filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you reduce occurence internal reflection identifying correctly when internal reflection occur then remove filter during those situation ( which not hard ) . i'm actually not fan lens filter ( any filter ) i think it only degrade picture quality we added layer sensor object , but i decided use them anyway all my lens . i would recommend everyone get one this filter if you don't any filter your lens yet .	-1
works advertised . you screw it end your lens , there you go	1
there some you who reading this because you wondering why should i pay more than grand this lens ? some may wonder if what they heard this lens true ? others may wonder if this lens any draw-backs ? first , let look canon product line . one time i owned several nikon cameras believed nikon product line strongly -- but film . technology quickly advancing prices dropping digital front , i knew it time decide again -- canon or nikon ? i happened visiting national park fort scott , kansas . there traveling professional photographer there who digital canon 5d . he showed me myriad ( luxury ) lenses he -- i stopped counting after seven ! " why canon over nikon ? " i asked . " they both excellent product lines , " he replied . " every year their digital camera body designs keep leap-frogging each other technological advances -- but i decided canon because its lenses . " duh ! course , it glass stupid -- i thought myself . based his recommendation , i purchased digital canon 30d body ( i wait technology leap forward some more pricing take drop before i invest more expensive body ) several lenses -- including 24-70mm f/ 2.8 . semi-professional photographer , i took assignment shooting conference hotel las vegas . shots included vendors tables , speakers awards ' ceremonies . rooms dimmly lighted professional photographer who knew hotel suggested i take flash even though he knew i would using 24-70 . it turned out , i needed but one lens entire shoot it 24-70 hood . other gear i used 30d grip , 580ex flash omni-bounce attachment cp-e3 compact battery pact -- all mounted strobofgrame pro-rl using camera quick release system . course , all total , there also 12 batteries : 2 camera , 4 580ex 8 cp-e3 . how shots turn-out ? i really need flash suggested even though i fast 2.8 lens ? first , i tried some shots without flash they turned-out okay , but flash needed professional shots . so , how shots turn-out ? canon delivered what it promised ! shots turned-out beautifully ! auto-focus fast quiet . color saturation magnificient subjects ' skin tones natural vibrant . it true what i heard 24-70 zoom -- quality so good it if i shooting different straight lens different focal lengths -- all one lens ! lens ' hood large impressive looking those who not into cameras . even though it serves purpose , hood its accompanying lens make amateur look like pro ! so why i list all above equipment ? because total it heavy ! you need grip your camera help balance this long heavy lens . i carried camera attached accessories around some seven hours end day my wrist/forearm muscles tired ! yes , i know i could battery pack attached my belt rather than frame -- but flexibility i decided not go direction . , frankly , i not think it would mattered . so , you going get quality this lens , but beware it heavy someone slightly built like myself . this reason , there some talk " image stabilization " added this lens , however , date it mere talk , personally , i not see it happening foreseeable future . also , me personally , because its weight , i not consider this walk-around lens i could carry me hours on-end . i know many argue this statement they probably lot physically stronger than me . so , you buy lens ? my opinion , it resounding " yes ! " couple caveats . price high , but it keeps increasing -- so buy it when rebates available manufacturer . also , not pay big bucks this lens unless you seriously into photography . canon many non-l lenses give you oustanding quality photographs -- sometimes there fine distinction photo derived lens non-l lens . unless you looking greatly enlarged photos , many cases it difficult see differences . so , save your money take advantage canon other quality lens instead . last , whatever you decide , enjoy capturing moments -- life short	1
there very little doubt this one better canon lenses available . however , why buy amazon when it price increase $73 soon canon starts 2006 fall rebate program . amazon officially become most expensive online retailer this lens .	1
this great lens . pictures i take very sharp alive color , brokeh excellent . i am big fan keeping shallow depth field when shooting people or animals , so f/ 2.8 helps out . also dim wedding receptions no problem even weak built flash my rebel xt . autofocus practically silent , accurate very fast . if you don't think you need f/ 2.8 , go 24-105mm f/4 . it extra 35mm telephoto end , image stabilization , lighter smaller	1
i am fisheye lens addict . i this lens few months now , i use it almost everything . lens worth every bit i payed it . sigma customer service so fast easy . lens takes clear sharp pictures everytime . this lens takes best skateboarding band pictures ! if you considering this lens , i would definately reccomend it . i love how pictures either circular or full frame . its great investment ......	1
marine pack dsc-n1 good enough get job . camera special housing setting change functionality camera so it used case . unfortunately , this means losing ability use manual settings . luckily , camera fine figuring out its own settings , though occasionally get picture just right you need it yourself . i taken case 130 feet several times never experienced leak	1
this my first camera i'm very happy choice i made . this camera allowed me take amazing pictures i wouldnt ' dream . i love accentuating colors taking sepia or black white pictures great backgrounds . it certainly aggregated value camera . before i bought this camera i used borrow my brother , i say mine so much better than his . colors more vivid , images look brighter i shoot faster mine . only feature i miss his camera i able cut picture right camera . my canon i wait get home , download picture then cut it . you should take picture if you dont ' like first one . one other thing : camera claims " image stabilized zoom " but didnt ' work me when i wanted take picture no flash . i hope it because lack experience , i'll try improve my skills so i come back give you more details specific feature camera itself . still , knowing all this , i would buy this camera again	1
i gave this camera my husband his birthday . it first digital camera we owned though my college age son his third one - all canon digital elphs . this such great little gadget - it smaller than pack cigarettes , big screen which view your photo(s ) , easy learn use , great taking trips - long you remember keep wrist strap your wrist while you using it so it doesn't drop break . i also purchased small canon digital printer which great us take our aging parents , take photos , print them immediately leave them our parents enjoy immediately . every canon product we own not disappointed us this little camera no exception !	1
i mainly use this when taking landscape shots where i want either make clouds pop or liven sky up some ( remember it works best 90 degrees sun . ) i also put it when shooting highly reflective vegetation or waterscapes would otherwise cause blown-out highlights . one other little secrete use this when shooting waterfalls since it allow you shoot slower shutter speeds thus increasing wispy waterfall look .	-1
you reading non technical review your average fun photographer . so don't expect lot technical stuff . i finally stepped up fuji s9000 . i loved my fuji cameras ease use colors they produce . i little reluctant spend kind money it takes get into d80 . i am thrilled i . i finally digital camera when kids something i catch it opposed camera taking shot after they left room . super fast . few saturdays ago i outside our wooded back yard taking pictures changing colors trees . when i went take shot flash popped up . i said this isn't right sun filtering though trees but i took shot anyway . wow camera new what . unbelievable photos . easy handle even pistolgrip mb d80 . i also sprung sb600 flash great two dvd training program ebay . so don't afraid spend couple grand d80 accesories . you glad you . happy alabam	1
i started d50 loved it very begining . i felt ready step up next level , but didn't think i ready d200 . when i heard d80 , i read everything i could . biggest selling point fact it same internal workings d200 more consumer friendly d50 body . i don't use all mode setting find myself shutter aperture priority most time , but it nice others there when i don't want think or time fiddle settings . camera image enhancements amazing -- but word caution . vivid +2 definitely give you vivid shots -- if not too much so . i've this baby 2 weeks imagine it my camera next couple years . compared canon 30d ( which i thinking ) or even new 400d ( i haven't actually held one yet ) , this nikon . batter life , i recent shoot where i took over 800 shots 3 hour period . battery half that quite bit lcd viewing . this level both canon nikon offer great equipment -- you can't go wrong either . just get one each your hands , snap few shots , go one feels best you	1
i've looking digital slrs ever since canon came out its 10d . since then , there so many so many companies . i've always canon user . i 2 eos bodies-the elan iie 7e . also canon ix , its aps camera which i still ( its small viewfinder major disappointment ) . anyhow 30d came , its viewfinder small too . camera still too large me , i just wasn't sold . now nikon d80 . it narrower than canon 30d , what breathtaking panoramically big viewfinder . such delight use . 2.5 " lcd seems fit perfectly back : nothing bigger or smaller would righ t.t he pictures fabulous . i bought 2 gb sandisk ultra ii card , which i thought would fast . it takes half second picture come lcd , but i'm not complaining . 2 gb big card . it hold 500 photos using normal jpeg , large image . i'm sure 1 gb would faster . canons , onboard flashes never would use advanced metering external flashes provided , but nikon d80 , i see such perfectly illuminated photos onboard flash . 18-135 lens something i jumped . 28-200 35 mm size quite huge range , yet lens not massive . i thought hard image stablization you could get canon 18-85 lens , but naaah , 30d just not measure up so i dropped idea . there always such things called tripods !! entire camera , lens battery feel just right , not too heavy . lens excellent . kit fits nicely into relatively small lowepro bag . this truly camera worth waiting years . 12 or 14 mp models sure come couple years , but i doubt they make bodies any more compact ; file size large enough it 10 mega-pixel . d80 so perfect shape i doubt nikon much better . this one fantastic digital slr . raj	1
i am no means pro taking pictures , but this camera makes me look close it . so far i just used it point shoot pictures really good quality . i am tring learn more functions one i run across so far i enjoy you choose certain functions your photo black white , color , or sepia . i am not high tech but i use this camera pretty easily . my first digital camera canon digital elf only 3.2 mega pixels there huge difference quality pictures when you compare . so if you affored spend more more mega pixels it . only down sides i seen so far it doesn't come w/ great memory card which most not i imagine if i not small hands camera would little awkward handle . it lots buttons dials so you hold just right so you don't hit any . but overal i am very satisfied w/ my purchase hope become better photographer help this camera . canon cameras served my family i very well over years	-1
this my third digital camera , but it few years since second it definitely obsolete . i tempted go top line , because i've two excellent slrs ( nikon minolta ) all trimmings , but prices made unfeasible right now . i'm very satisfied features canon g6 however ; i've taken 400 shots so far , plus one movie , tried out all software stitching panoramas together , etc . i still mainly use photoshop , but canon software quite good . photo quality excellent , including color opticalzoom wideangle range good most purposes . macro setting also nice job . controls easy use most part anyone all familiar full featured slrs , better than most . i've made very few mistakes field result control confusion . what i'm less thrilled ( nitpicking ): like most electronics these days , even if you've got very small hands like me , it hard keep getting finger wrong place , just every square inch covered control . i would liked insert ( like nikon supplies ) cover flash hotshoe contacts . every time i remove battery or memory card , i watch out grab camera few areas don't control them . also , cable input typical tiny plastic door would all too easy break off , neck strap attachment too close memory card door , tends interfere it opening all way . also , preview mode it tells you how many shots you taken but not how many left , shooting mode , vice versa . it annoying switch shooting mode see how many left , especially if you using lens cover , because then lens deploys out , you remember take lens cover off first ( deploying lens cover no-no . ) i also got camera case designed g6 . again like all too many " cases " it tight fit , only single inside pocket you only get extra card still get camera too . case would not really good dust protection it zips up sides but top opening just covered flap . because tight awkward fit , it easy accidentally turn camera , deploying lens , while putting camera into case . case comes belt loop , but you supply your own belt , it no other strap or handle except tiny loop located top end side zipper , where it just gets way . not good design . i also checked out some accessories available , like additional lens flash , but they're very expensive , like macro lights more than camera ! so i don't know if i'll get any add-ons later . but overall , g6 already my next favorite camera my nikon slr , powerful yet easy use , even fun ! definitely 5 stars camera , 1 star case	1
this must product any digital rebel xt owner . always carry spare fully charged battery . amazon competitive pricing structure very timely delivery	1
very good rechargable battery pack . holds charge long time even if camera not used much . capable taking many shots plenty review time . very pleased it	1

after searching internet i found amazon place where this item lowest price . fast delivery , great product . fits great my panasonic 6 megapixels camera . fine leather . could not any happier product	1
great kit , i use it lot . first , here what inside . small rocket blower - great little thing , tends whistle through red plastic tip though . so , it not great quiet places . retractable brush - great little thing , tends shed hairs , but not terribly . cleaning solution - i notice it lifted some color off multicoated lens . oddly , it only one lens , only once . lens looks fine , still takes sharp pictures without any flare . jury out , but i still use it w/o fear . cotton swabs - never used em , but they look nice . microfiber cloth - nice full sized cloth . very soft , great when buffing out spots	-1
beware assuming uv filter recommended amazon particular camera fixed lense size i purchased correct size . it wasn't even close . no size given lense diameter . i returned filter full refund minus my shipping all hassel packaging it	-1
pros : - picture quality very good , but 7.2 megapixel picture 3mb wich pretty big thats reason you might want buy bigger memory card . - big 2.5 " lcd get you some attention bystanders around you . - video mode high quality very good ! this feature impressed me , i use it most ( depening occasion ) . this camera better resolution than my brothers sony camera recorder . some reason my baterry seems drain little faster than taking pictures . ( i own 2gb memory stick pro duo , wich enough record take pictures day , but i don't think battery hang in)cons : - there isn't many cons me , becuase i looking point shot camera 2.5 " lcd or 3 " - only thing i didn't like video mode you can't zoom while recording , other than this camera nice great pocket camera . - pictures come out blury times when you really shaky but sony pretty good image stabilization . ( this also great sport camera wich you capture pitures fast moving object .	1
this great camera traveling , it small enough fit into your top pocket , so it go anywhere . only problem i there no underwater housing it , if there i would given it 5 *	-1
i bought this camera couple months ago because i wanted small digital camera would easy carry me . since then , i've found s5i wonderful camera takes clear colorful pictures easily fit your pocket . here some praises s5i : 1 . this camera tiny . it smaller than my cellphone . this makes it extremely easy bring when going trip or just out day . i it my pocket all times , ready capture any moment . i brought it recent trip everybody thought it great . end day we hooked it up tv hotel watched slide show day . everyone loved it . 2 . battery life incredible . i this thing couple months i only charged it like 4 times . even extended use flash screen , battery still keeps kicking . very different my cellphone ! 3 . super macro focus setting creates beautiful photos . this something i didn't realize camera until after i bought it . you get right up things take these really colorful crisp images . flowers plants look incredible . 4 . red-eye reduction best i've ever seen . red-eye flash mode , camera flashes once then second later flashes again takes picture . none my pictures suffer red-eye anymore . flash also very powerful . 5 . it many manual settings more artistic pictures . i still haven't even gotten check out all little features this camera comes . it lot different " scene " presets also allows you manual mode ( focus exposure ) . overall , this camera met exceeded all expectations i . i would definitely recommend pentax s5i family member or friend .	1
excellent product . works expected . like all lens hoods though pricey	1
this great back pack ! if there anything i would change it would logo front . it brite shinny , i'd rather not advertise i camera there ! i colored it felt pen it works great ....... overall , i love backpack !!	1

i've shifted my previous canon powershot g2 this wonderful dslr , canon eos 400d ( or digital rebel xti ) so far i all praises . though my g2 took great pictures , there mile difference dslr deliver . quality clarity each shot instantly makes your pictures look like they taken professional . rebel xti handling deja vu me because i used canon eos 300 ( or rebel ) . but its big leap me terms plethora functions features compared my camera past . i always bring my camera just case i see moment worth capturing . you see some my pictures [ ...	1
xti feature laden , but takes fantastic " point shoot " photos . seems significant improvement canon rebel xt , wonderful camera . money , best slr going	1
well , i've my rebel xti 6weeks now , all i say wow !!! i rebel xt , which awesome camera . i'm not professional , but i take pictures what ever it may outside or inside , youth or adult events hobby . this camera not person who wants just point shoot or camera stuff your pocket . this camera creative person who wants control pictures they taking . sensor cleaner wide lcd just few wonderful advances xt xti . camera me easy use takes great pictures auto mode or my mode . i hope this helps you your decision whether buy or not .	1
while this review not technical others all i say quality end result well worth money ! i shot wedding this past weekend 2 days after receiving this lens am just going over some photos all i say this piece glass given me razor sharpness i've looking . i've hesitant into jumping into " " lens arena but now i'm here i could never go back ! don't settle less ! your photography worth it	1
i both lenses , 24-105 4 28-135 3.5 - 5.6 . i 20d , but my wife i decided we each wanted camera ourselves so i bought 24-105 lens 30d 2 months ago . i so sure i'd see big difference lens since my 70-200 2.8 such superior lens . thing , i can't justify it . i've set camera tripod switched lenses back forth taking pictures identical light settings variety subjects . ( they both take extremely nice pictures ) maybe full frame sensor difference would apparent . this point i like extra reach 135mm . i'll let my wife use $1200 lens . my recommendation : money cropped sensor camera i'd stick 28-135 lens	-1
this my all time favorite lense . eat your hearts out nikon , olympus pentex , because this baby alone reason enough go canon . i cannot begin tell you how sharp this " " lense . words fail me . second thought , no they don't . use this lense you'll wind up photos shaper than lightening blade , clearer than ghost eyes , crisper than new dawn uncharted island . i shot portrait two book covers this lense . wedding photos my best friend wedding every one turned out better than ones they paid wedding pro hundreds dollars . i'm documenting growth my child this lense i've caught hundred my girl smiles it yes , sometimes even tear or two . you cannot go wrong canon " " lense . they tops , they really . jack priest , sailor home se	1
this uv filter it job protect lens well . build solid ( metal construction ) . glass also descent quality . performance , it absorbs some uv light . uv light absorbtion hardly noticeable , probably sky 1-a haze filter version absorb more uv light than this lens which fine me . now , one problem which internal reflection . i've heard many people say it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out it not caused directly low light/night situation . internal reflection appear when there strong/bright source light comparison overall exposure ( surrounding environment ) . put it example ( which hopefully easier understand ) , when you take picture lamp during nightime light much brighter than surrounding area then you see internal reflection . you move position light closer sides/corner picture ( not center picture ) , internal reflection reduces finally dissapear ( if you move light far enough center ) . if light isn't too bright/contrast compare surrounding environment then there no internal reflection . but course most time , lamp nightime often very bright . but point i'm trying make internal reflection doesn't happen all time during low light or night time . additionally , internal reflection isn't only happening night . it also happen afternoon if you taking picture sun example . basically same rule above , how bright light source compared surrounding area , you move sun center photo near side internal reflection move side/dissapear ( also depending angle ) . but best way just remove filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you reduce occurence internal reflection identifying correctly when internal reflection occur then remove filter during those situation ( which not hard ) . i'm actually not fan lens filter ( any filter ) i think it only degrade picture quality we added layer sensor object , but i decided use them anyway all my lens . i would recommend everyone get one this filter if you don't any filter your lens . i got this filter friend mine his nikon 18-70mm ed dx lens .	-1
i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
while this lens great improvement over kit lenses focus often soft raw modes overal just not always tight . color accuracy very good , not perfect but very good . course color accuracy more often result your paper ( yes really - it ) than your lens after you get certain point . after using this lens 2 months shooting perhaps 20,000 shots it i wished i saved my money inevitable series lens . if color accuracy your main issue , sure look your photo paper too . hp , kodak , even low end papers inkpress all strang things color blur your images . try someone like moab paper . you amazed how much difference it make your color accuracy detail . i just switched kokapelli moab commercial prints am amazed results . usually case focus softest 3.5 though it produce surprisingly decent bokeh	-1
i given this lens after my sigma 28-135mm lens broke . while lens fixed , i haven't used it since attatching canon lens my camera . canon 28-105mm may smaller zoom range , but other than clearly superior lens every respect . it sturdy , fast-focusing , sharp , good color . short , it what you hope find when purchasing consumer grade lens . there other cheaper lenses market , like sigma lens or canon f/4- 5.6 , but this lens worth extra $100 its reliability , sharpness overall usability	1
i this product over two years used it extensively my travels . yes it shortfalls " may " considered expensive , but price it better than some other " aftermarket " designs other camera makes . amature timelapse timed exposures it works quite well . far remote instant low light or exposure shots it expensive , get canon rs-80n3 shutter releasethe biggest complaints seems limited number shots [ 99 ] certain modes shortness connecting cable length . using " continous " mode i not failed capture timelapse photos filled my needs . short connecting cable corrected purchasing canon et-1000n3 extension cable [ 33 ft ] . now $2.50 + foot , expensive ! but my persuit remote control capability must . battery life fantastic , thousands shots still going strong . course like camera battery spare blessing [ this case cheap ] . i think it good accessory , if you enjoy time lapse spent money one new eos cam then price comparable your continuing outlay your hobby .

ok start off i've heard different opinions camera sensor blowers .. some say it works like magic some say it make it worse . so i gambled bought this giotto blower . i didn't want buy all cleaning swabs , liquid ect rub it off ... seemed like annoying project . so i gave this blower try . i never much dust my sensor but when made my aperture smaller f/22 exact picture blue sky i noticed few blobs or dust spots . i wanted them off ... now heres where blower comes . i used it total 3 times it removed 98% dust off my sensor .. thats really really good my book $9 device . now i like 2 tiny dust spots my sensor i easily live .. or i could try use it few more times completely get it off ... meantime i'm very happy dust i got off it . buy this blower .... its no brainer .	1
i quite annoyed when i found my d70 come out box dust lens . place i bought it would only send it away nikon cleaning , but friend same camera advised me get dust blower showed me how i should able blow dust off myself . first blower i tried didn't enough power dust remained . i almost decided take camera get it cleaned when i read review suggested this one . i took chance , after 15 minutes trying , checking , trying again , i finally dust free sensor ! this most valuable piece equipment i purchased my camera , i recommend this anyone similar problem	1
one problems owning digital camera you'll occasionally clean dust off image sensor . you can't use compressed air because it freeze destroy your sensor . you don't really want blow either because moisture your breath damage your sensor ... make you pass out . you need " dry " , relatively-high pressure air this what rocket air outstanding . simple use . 1-remove your lens ( slr ) , 2-put into cleaning mode , 3-hang camera upside down ( presumably , allow dust fall out ) , 4-squeeze rocket air thereby cleaning camera . this point , i swear it . i'm constantly changing lenses this helps remove spects ghost images . it must your camera kit	1
this one fantastic flash . i it my canon a2e four years , ambivilent , but if you match this lens one canon newer bodies funcionality access all 550ex features , you awesome , powerful , flexable flash change way you shoot	1
im graphic design student college , so i really needed camera . i decided this one i am really glad i . pictures nice clean . camera itslef very sleek looking one very compact . only downfall this it eats batteries pretty quick , but i just took them out when i wasnt using them . buy this camera	1
after hearing consumer reports gave canon a520 best buy rating , i decided this must good family cameras . it joy own use . easy take pictures , easy work yes , it takes great pictures . it more bells it than i ever use . i very satisfied 4 5 mp cameras not wanted spend fortune more . i just need take pictures , review them easily download my computer . this much , much more	1
i got this much safety anything . if i should drop my lens , solid lens hood help . plastic construction absorb some impact without transmitting all it , metal hood would . hopefully it eliminate occurances flair , although canon 50mm 1.4 lens , that not big issue begin . it also keep dust debris off lens surface if you're shooting less-than-ideal environment . it twists off lens easily . when it , it very snug secure . kind pricy piece plastic , but canon business make money .	1
exz750 simply fantastic compact camera . it takes great pictures , even greater if you bother use one many picture presets ( scenery , portrait , macro , etc . ) . pros : - picture quality great ; if you want anything better you'll probably lugging around dslr- picture presets extremely easy use , even if you not techie / or you've never handled camera your life ( there such person ? ) . - it fit into your pocket you'll forget it there . this major advantage best camera camera you actually you - this one you . - common settings ( picture size , iso , etc . ) one or two clicks away - very convenientthe cons : - camera take videos ( more than decent resolution ) but they come out shaky even if you pretty steady hands . without some image stabilization it , it definitely not replacement video camera- although camera iso settings 200 400 you should probably avoid them due noiseoverall , very positive pleasing experience . even digital slr , i'm never giving this little puppy up	1
this lens my favorite i keep it my rebel xt all times . i enjoy taking macro close-ups portrai t-t ype shots , which makes this great lens everyday use . it light-weight not bulky . my last slr camera ( years ago ) minolta 50mm f/ 1.8 lens , various other lenses i rarely used . i usually don't use zoom lens due extra length weight . also , most non-professional zoom lenses much slower closest tele-position due higher f/stop . fixed focal length 60mm , i don't mind moving myself toward or away subject ( not big deal ) . pictures always appear sharp good contrast color saturation . my opinion this lens : " buy it ... you'll like it " . i ... i love it . good luck	1
4 starts because otherwise 5 stars inevitable : 1 ) slow autofocus ( hunt times ) but expected macro lens . 2 ) built quality not solid expected this price range . i bought this lens instead two purpose : macro portrait ! i thinking buying 100mm macro plus 85mm 1.8 but this lens saves me buying two lenses ! i very happy it what it . i don't flying insects very much so it not problem but said i able get 1:1 shot fly , see sample here : http://www.theteh.com/html/3rd_350d_54.htmlthere other samples this gallery here : http://www.theteh.com/html/my_3rd_350d_xt.htmlthe large aperture ( 2.8 ) means one could shallow dof great low light such this pic : http://www.theteh.com/html/3rd_350d_49.htmlfor portrait , i accidentally took this photo during london bombing women ' shocked ' incident unfolding public tv display . it coincident her background inmage winning reuter photo tsunami tragedy matching colour their dresses ! i quite far away so able capture her head toe : http://www.theteh.com/html/3rd_350d_25.htmlthis illustrate capability both macro normal photography using this lens . you not regret it unless your primary aim shoot flying insets where longer 100mm or 150mm macro lenses may needed this case .	-1
this battery works my canon sd550 interchangeably withthe canon nb3l came it . i get many shots either one .	1
i bought this battery extra battery my camera . it lot lower price than canon battery . i not used either my original or this extra battery enough fully compare them , but they seem work equally well so far	1
its time price ( time ) , fantastic camera . 6.3 mp more than sufficient most amateur semi-pro ( non-studio ) work , this camera works very well what really matters : canon fantastic lenses . battery life this camera very good . " shutter lag " ( when you depress button when camera actually takes photo ) fairly well non-existent , only real lag i when i am shooting multiple photos raw format . most photographers know , lens almost more important than body , outside leica lenses , i don't think anything really competes canon line . 18-55 lens comes this camera sufficient casual work ... i used it beach , hikes my dog , when i don't want lug around my bigger , more expensive , higher-quality lenses . but $75 or so , you 50mm 1.8 eos lens , which supplement 18-55 nicely , particularly night photography . my one complaint this camera its ability meter light adequately dark settings . when i shoot raw this isn't such big problem , because i fix it photoshop , but most everything i shoot inside , unless i manually mess white balance every time , orange tint interesting first 200 shots , then annoying after . i think more advanced eos models come out since 2004 or so fix this color problem , also help bit lag raw shots ... but money , this camera excellent , far , far superior , example , olympus ' digital exquivalent ( similar price ) . difference , far i'm concerned , absolute advantage canon lens quality . you use high-end consumer body like this one , use professional piece canon glass ( lens ) take excellent photos . i wouldn't invest system doesn't also boast excellent lens quality	1
this review really two parts : one amateur who using point shoots , or experience film based slrs ; other one prosumer or advanced amateur who either going digital film canon eos bodies or getting into pro-level digital shooting low end . former , camera pretty much all you need ; latter , it lacking key functionality , but workable . i'm latter category . i've freelance photo work past , but not since digital age began take off late ' 90s . i've shooting eos cameras since early ' 90s , added medium format late ' 90s wedding portrait work . i'll honest : i didn't like idea digital first . sure , workflow improvements over film sounded great , but i wasn't seeing quality digital vs . film . i still am very much believer , least prints , especially big prints , film delivers better overall picture quality . but quality digital slrs since release digital rebel so good , workflow advantages trump film all but rare situations . i'll still use my medium format equipment landscape outdoor pics i'll print large frame , but other than pocket 35mm , i can't see using film much all category , after seeing what i dreb . if you primarily amateur who either used using point shoot ( film or digital ) or who used consumer film slr , you'll find this camera easy operate use extent you used your other cameras . i bought this without lens , i other lenses packaged one didn't offer me anything , but those without canon glass , you get surprisingly good lens kit . remember , though , lens only fit digital rebel , its successors , possibly 10/20d line canon eos bodies . shooting pretty simple . charge battery , which easy -- charger blinks depending upon its charge . you look charger battery there see where you , charge wise . it doesn't take very long charge battery fully . once you battery camera , you'll need compact flash card . i recommend sandisk ultra ii cards . you won't experience any write time problems over above this camera natural limitations . then , set iso value ( 100-1600 ) , set either pre-programed mode one side dial , or traditional program/shutter priority/apeture priority settings other side , you ready rock . remember unlike many digital cameras , led back camers not function viewfinder . aside displaying various camera options , it shows what you shot after shooting . if you want use this advanced amateur/pro setup , you , but know its limitations . i bought this march shooting all sports it . i'm using canon usm lens , gotten some terrific shots . but i've also missed some led me decide sell this camera pick up 20d . problem i get into focusing speed zones . 2.5 fps only 4 frame burst isn't big problem it sounds . i still get good action burst mode , but admittedly 5 fps 22 or 25 ( 20d ) bursts much better . if you want use this shoot something like concerts or indoor events , you won't same focusing issues . you deal any flash limitations , but information , you read review . i'm not camera flash guy under any definition . only real problem i've this camera my shots consistently underexposed . 5- . 7 stop . i shoot exclusively raw mode ( never shot jpg this one other than first dozen or so shots ) it correctable when i convert images . this more minor irritation , may not noticable jpeg shots . i've seen others using this camera complain it well . this camera good consumer camera you find . if pro , or semi-pro , make something function his or her needs , you know consumer get everything they need out this . i've shooting since i 8 or so , owned umpteen cameras , this one fills its market niche good any them	1
i purchased d-30 amazon last year i previously using digital nikon . improvement monumental all aspects . i subsequently drowned my camera , i am getting ready repurchase d30 . they not ready water yet ? i taken approximately 5000 pictures saved them all most usable format i continue same . photoshop software comes camera very user friendly , i am sure there many features yet learn , but i extremely happy what i already used . i hesitate say mastered	1
this camera designed entry-level snapshot camera it very good just . it takes decent photos very easy use . other reviewers indicated , it tend chew through batteries , but i just buy aas cheap sam don't worry it . it works especially well outdoor situtions . it performs less well low light . due this limitation , it just useless webcam . even all lights room , webcam image almost totally black . flash lens less than inch apart , so this camera very prone redeye . there redeye reduction mode flash works okay , but doesn't totally fix problem . all-in-all , entry-level camera , a200 quite usable . just aware what it don't expect it more .	-1
canon lenses known their great optics priceyness . this fast tele excellent value . only thing would improve this lens would addition image stabilizion feature found few canon optics . course , advantage large aperature lenses you set fast shutter speed still enough light shot . this lens surprisingly compact , ( long focal length teles go ) . autofocus very fast quiet . comes hood , too .	1
this standard kit lens comes rebel 20d . this lens most definitely built budget . it ever show ! completely inexcusable lack numbering any kind focusing ring . this very frustrating when it comes taking pictures distant objects , since you cannot simply set it infinity . also , because it goes into macro mode beyond infinity , you cannot simply crank it all way one side ! course , you always use autofocus if you wish . but this doesn't work night photography . fact , you might well forget doing any night photography this lens due inability focus it based estimation distance ( fact autofocus doesn't work dark ) . besides this nagging problem , lens just not very sharp . when i first got my rebel , i very impressed pictures it took , since all i compare it pictures taken point-and-shoots . but after taking several hundred pictures it , i find most cases , pictures very much soft side . this particular problem distant objects . even when focused those distant objects , they never appear really sharp , although objects intermediate distance ( ~ 100ft ) seem okay . let face it . this lens just doesn't it . unless you really hard up cash , steer clear	-1
pros : excellent picture quality , great zoom , nice panoramic feature , sd card , great video sound quality picture camera , best you this money lcd rotate any angle . cons : flash not pop up automatically ; just 16mb sd card box . pd : this camera size not pocket one but size good enough shoot one hand . advice : use rechargeable batteries large sd card ( 2 or 4 gb ) cause video so good you love shooting . also , must times you need flash indoor other way you bad pics ; flash results amazed you .	1
over last 50 years , i purchased four film cameras five digital cameras . far , canon s3 best camera i owned . most cameras i bought cost more s3 . i returned recently three-week trip scandinavia st. petersburg , russia . during trip , i took almost 2500 photos s3 . photo quality excellent , camera controls easy use , camera performance outstanding . i expect use s3 many years .	1
i no investment dslr but narrowed my choices canon 30d nikon d200 . i always wanted nikon . d200 definitely joy hold it take good pictures ( i tried both camera store before i bought 30d ) . i lot research ( more than i care admit ! ) there no conclusive evidence one camera clear edge over other . depending your specific needs , one camera may " slightly better " than other . after trying out both cameras , i convinced 30d good fit my needs d200 . " value money " 30d clear winner over d200 ( i got mine when canon cash canon promotion going ) . also , beginner slr i found 30d its fully automatic scene modes easy start out . i don't expect use scene modes or full auto mode after week or two . i expect quickly graduate creative control zones . but use family camera , quick scene modes very helpful . if you expect use it more professional basis it'd probably not matter . additionally , when i checked it out store , i noticed canon 30d focused sharply almost every time . d200 not least few times . i'd take this grain salt though since it brief trial store . but i thought i'd share my experience . it may just anomaly actual equipment i tried out . i still find nikon d200 great camera ? absolutely ! i regret bought canon 30d ? absolutely not ! decision swinger my case really " money factor " . i more than willing spend up $300 more nikon d200 . but when difference became $550 it no longer became justifiable my christmas gift myself :-) my purchases included canon 30d [ ... ] , canon 17-85mm ef-s usm lens [ ... ] , sandisk extreme iii 2gb compact flash card [ ... ] i plan add external flash this soon , consider eventual lenses after i determine camera long-term keeper .	1
i am so pleased this camera ! there really nothing negative i think say it ! i also own cannon xt . i use both wedding photography well family portraits i am so impressed color quality d30 ! well cannon	1
i upgraded canon digital rebel ( grey body ) this because i ready take my photography new level . one thing i like most this camera it flash compenstation . i purchased 430ex flash it because i tired use built flash always getting those hard shadows wall	1
i purchased filter kit my sony camera . price considerably cheaper than sony quality great ! i'm looking into other items offered good price opteka	1
excellent product works well . made canon ef28-135mm lense . reasonable price	1
when i first got camera i nervous whether or not i'd able use understand it well since i usually buy point shoot type camera . i pleasantly surprised how easy it use all functions it really . pictures really high quality video crystal clear . camera lightweight perfect grab go or capture any occasion . i like design it i love fact i get professional looking pictures time time again ...	1
accessories like lens converters , wide angle long angle lenses , filters i purchased canon powershot s1 compatible canon powershot s2 or canon powershot s3 ? i am looking updgrade , i want know what costs i other than camera itself memory ( since s1 used compact flash memory ) . thanks	1
excellent addition rebel xt . tried lower cost generic flash units . my only regret i waited so long get 430ex	-1
it works great , there just two issues . when you lock it hot shoe , it very , very difficult unlock ( you twist wheel tighten it ) when batteries my camera low , camera flash start computer problems act very strange ( i cannon digital rebel xt ) . other than those towo issues , which comparison seem very small me , flash fantastic ! lightweight easy use	-1
this terrific lens , my new favorite . excellent feature ; i wish all my lenses it . even 2x teleconverter , it rock steady viewing shooting . my images sharp tack great contrast color . i'd pay three times this much get any better telephoto images	1
this canon lens upholds tradition fine products canon line photographic accessories . it takes very clear , sharp , hand held pictures image stabilizer capability activated . it negates necessity carrying tripod every time one wants take long telephoto shots . it should must any serious photographer wanders countryside , taking candid pictures , wants lighten load equipment carried	1
excellent camera high end capabilities . easy use intuitive system controls	1
this camera amazing , i couldn't asked more . just warned manual pretty terrible . it best just play around camera until you figure it out , rather than wasting time trying decipher manual	1
works well normal cameratried it adapter s3 adapter not fit robustly . filter o	-1
ordered one march its came fine ( not used or abused like others mentioned ) . amazon.com retailer . i use it mostly lens protection aspect it works great , fact i'm ordering right now	1
this lens superb . it feels like high quality pro lens ( not surprisingly ) . shots just stunning ; fantastic color , razor sharp , beautiful bokeh etc etc . i initially considered 18-200(vr ) until i saw comments this lens . look into it , what i tell there very little ( real ) comparison two . i believe you forget how much you paid soon you see results . i mention this lens superb ....?	1
this uv filter it job protect lens well . build solid ( metal construction ) . glass also descent quality . performance , it absorbs some uv light . uv light absorbtion hardly noticeable , probably sky 1-a haze filter version absorb more uv light than this lens which fine me . now , one problem which internal reflection . i've heard many people say it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out it not caused directly low light/night situation . internal reflection appear when there strong/bright source light comparison overall exposure ( surrounding environment ) . put it example ( which hopefully easier understand ) , when you take picture lamp during nightime light much brighter than surrounding area then you see internal reflection . you move position light closer sides/corner picture ( not center picture ) , internal reflection reduces finally dissapear ( if you move light far enough center ) . if light isn't too bright/contrast compare surrounding environment then there no internal reflection . but course most time , lamp nightime often very bright . but point i'm trying make internal reflection doesn't happen all time during low light or night time . additionally , internal reflection isn't only happening night . it also happen afternoon if you taking picture sun example . basically same rule above , how bright light source compared surrounding area , you move sun center photo near side internal reflection move side/dissapear ( also depending angle ) . but best way just remove filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you reduce occurence internal reflection identifying correctly when internal reflection occur then remove filter during those situation ( which not hard ) . i'm actually not fan lens filter ( any filter ) i think it only degrade picture quality we added layer sensor object , but i decided use them anyway all my lens . i would recommend everyone get one this filter if you don't any filter your lens .	-1
i get least uv filter all my lenses . that cheapest insurance you get you lense . protect it possible scratches banging against objects . haven't really seen major difference brand filter tiffen filter . i would just go cheapest filter found you lens	1
i am only giving 4 stars , because i just receive it through mail couple days ago . so i still haven't get chance fully try out everything . but i tell you this camera very handy , it very small i throw it my small purse ( my purse usually don't much room , b/c i would already so much stuff it , like my pda , i-pod , cell phone , wallet , keys , pack tissue et . ) take it me anywhere . i love design this camera , it very cool . pictures pretty clear , even one taking during nights . thing i love this camera it not noisy , it very quick ( i no patience , so it good me i snap pictures crazy quickly ) . overall , i find this camera pretty good .	-1
i like canon digital camera because it everything average person may want . it light , great design , works incredibly good i make hundreds pictures . isn't dream come true ? highest recommendation	1
i really looked hard various light ( sub-3 lb ) tripod options use my canon powershot s2 . lighter better , but i also really wanted 3-way pan head all little nice extras i could get : bubble level , quick set-up/tear-down , fits inside carry-on luggage , good build quality , comes bag , good hand crank , etc . it definitely fit bill perfectly , only 2 lbs ! course you don't get super strong wind-proof stability weight , but i really quite happy overall stability my recent vacation . when there strong wind , i leaned bag , backpack , or beach towel around one legs gave me more piece mind ... but i think it probably would fine ... especially when not fully extended max height . before buying it , max height actually my only real concern -- would it tall enough take good people pictures/outdoor portraits while i my vacation ? my experience says -- yes , great people shots ( so much better than typical shot you get asking passing stranger take photo you)!don't hesitate , just buy this one !	1
first , canon 1ds mark ii awesome professional camera . this review completely misleading amazon offer 42% off . this biggest joke imaginable . amazon website shows list price $ 11,999 . 99 . when canon launched this camera msrp wasn't high . it $ 7,999 . methinks someone calculator got carried away . anyway , after adding it my cart see unbelievable low price it turns out its within $100 what every other reputable online shop selling it . i expected more amazon . this behavior reprehensible	1
i shooting digital four years now mostly kodak dcs cameras(660 through dcspro ) . life long nikon guy it big decision make switch canon 1ds mk2 . this camera light years ahead any kodak digital slr . i use this camera studio product , models , location , low light , you name it . canon never produced anything but astounding images me . all image parameters including sharpness far superior any old images i my kodak days . yes it pricey but if you working this camera you pay easily long before it useful days over .	1
this hood comes 70-200 lens my local shop didn't stock it . they said it special order part it would take week it come . i ordered it friday , received it wednesday . not bad . thanks amazon	-1
i skeptical when i ordered pen because i wasn't too sure how clean it would really keep my lens . last week i traveled through out mexico visited some beautiful places , seeing lot family members . all these family members around , few accidently touched my lenses . i decided it would perfect time test my new pen . end result ? perfection ! lenses looked like thru brand new ! i used carry little paper whipes designed lenses , but now i use nikon lens pen i don't need worry carrying whipes throwing them away	1
other reviewers complained plastic foot flash-bracket end cracking or breaking off . solution metal " sacrificial foot " screws into 1/4 " -20 threads bottom . bogen/manfrotto 3298 ( bo3298 ) works perfectly . no amazon vendor carries it this date , but you find it bhphotovideo.com . their listing says it nikon , but it works canon off camera shoe cord 2 well	-1
there not much say this , since there no other alternatives me . simply stated , i went lowest price i could find .	1
this my first digital camera i ever bought , i am completely satisfied it . talk abt resolution or camera feature . all it packed into one small sleek camera . i recommend this digital camera everybody . i would say if i would decided later future get one . i would alwayz go canon . they best making digital cameras	1
i purchased my sb-600 day before my granddaughter birthday party our local skating rink . very little time test unit prior party , i dove right . i amazed exposures very close shots , believe it or not , entire length skating rink . auto-zoom really cool feature changes match your lense setting wide telephoto . i made 150 shots first time out using nimh batteries no significant drain . this time , i found absolutely no negative points . i may even purchase couple more replace my portable photogenic studio lights	1
well priced works beautifully . no complaints - exactly what it said tin .	1
this camera looks amazing , not i ever money it . i am impressed this camera choice shoot feature film ! it used shoot tim burton corpse bride	1

very solid camera , but bit heavy . good battery life . it very professional camera	1
so this great starter lens , it came my canon body when i got my camera , i've used it tons . it light , smooth , fast focus , cheap . my only problem number times i found myself stepping back because 35mm end zoom wasn't wide enough . i now carry 22-55 instead love lens ( come amazon - get it stock ) . if you're budget then this lens great . if you afford little extra go 28-80 instead	-1
these my experiences extender mounted my eos 10d . i'm currently debating whether or not buy it my new 30d , but it looks like i don't want risk wasting my money . let me explain : let me start saying only reason i gave this 2 stars instead 1 because it prevent my nose smudging lcd screen . i shoot events nightclubs lot , so i'm always ( ) running around get shots , causing me sweat , which causes sweaty oily nose tip ( ) i always show subjects their photos after i take them , so smudgy screen kind annoying . further clarification , i'm asian , so my nose not defined or long other ethnicities . i run around lot when i shoot . so constant activity eventually led extender naturally fall off . i got lucky once , found it general vicinity where i , but second time , i wasn't so lucky . so what i ? i purchased one . not only i purchase extender , i purchase viewfinder replacement ( piece soft rubber ) because attached lost extender . 2 weeks , again , same problem . i didn't even bother buying any replacements , this time , i upgraded 30d . if you don't plan doing lot running around , then this piece may okay you . however , please take into consideration this piece also fell off me while putting my camera back my canon backpack . some reason , piece didn't fit tightly mount camera . problem , most people mentioned , images very noticeably smaller through this extender , so prepared strained eyes if you plan using your camera all day . i guess i'll check it out my local camera shop see how it fits 30d ; i'll sure write review if results different than 10d	-1
eyeglass wearer , i suffered needlessly years	1
technical details this lens found abundance elsewhere , so i'll leave experts simply say : this my favorite lens . i love this lens so much . i half dozen other medium high-end lenses , this one i keep camera 90% time	1
when digital cameras first came out , i , like many people swore i'd always loyal film . digital could never take place film . i'm not convinced it replaced film completely . there still something i love putting roll film camera , shooting away , sending film processed , seeing results . i also know it bit expensive . i know argument quality always paramount discussion , but digital cameras improving this regard , most manufacturers assuring users while technology always improving , we point where good investment made digital slr it not outdated soon buyer purchases camera . so i figured now time get digital slr . i loyal nikon user nearly ten years , owned nikon n60 , n70 , n80 . my first love , still n70 ( i've told person who sold me camera he thought i only person who loved n70 ) . i purchased n80 only after my n70 cost too much repair , but i've enjoyed way my various nikon cameras handled all sorts situations fact they simple use point shoot if i don't time use specific controls , but it also options more creative artistic purposes . my nikon cameras allowed me capture family moments ease majestic landscapes , wildlife shots all sorts other things i can't resist capture forever . i decided purchase d70 since it close what i've already experienced nikon . many ways it works similar way n70 80 , except it digital rather than film version . like film versions midrange nikon slr , it dial allows automatic setting , portrait , landscape , sports , close-up , nightscape , night portrait modes , ability select aperture , shutter speed or manual controls . camera auto manual focus abilities . photos easy or technical photographer desires . controls easy use , though it takes practice comfortable . personal level , camera passed halloween test , niece birthday test , fall foliage new england test favorite scenic spots test . only real difficulty i've camera trying capture stained glass windows dark setting . auto focus not worked all i'm not thrilled manual focus these shots , but this point i'm sure it photographer not camera . i one suggestion anyone who purchases this camera . manual very confusing . it uses all sorts symbols more distraction than anything else . i've luck " magic lantern guides " my other cameras , but not yet used it this camera . i purchase nikon d70 field guide ( david busch , wiley publishing ) which helpful . it quick reference anyone already familiar nikon photography general but it also provides introduction novice photography .	1
d70s minor update original d70 introduced 2004 , few new features slightly larger lcd . it still great camera , but expect it replaced new d80 , which 40 percent more pixels , 2.5 -inch lcd , additional useful features old price d70s . so , you probably save little money still purchase sophisticated digital slr if you wait until prices d70s stabilize new , lower level . , say , $600 , this camera would incredible bargain . d70s shined one best cameras its class since its introduction . example , it 1/500th second flash synch speed ( found no other camera but d50 ) so you keep ambient light under control avoid ghost images . its autofocus fast accurate , features both single-autofocus , continuous-autofocus ( tracking action ) , novel " automatic " autofocus mode switches af-s af-c required . if you no nikon lenses , get this camera 18-70mm kit lens , which very sharp versatile , rather than more limited 18-55 lens . you won't regret it	1
this lens ok magnifying 2x max . full zoom , magnification not sharp without close-up lens	-1
don't disappointed because this isn't lithium ion battery . this battery kicks butt !! it lasted me 3 days non stop shooting . i started think battery never going die ! course reality set eventually charge it , but it lasted forever !! only drawback it takes 2 hours charge :( other than , it lasts you all day night	1
well , besides whole bucket full money , one them lets you take photos lower light , okay , that obvious . 16-35mm bit heavier , but not so you'd notice , unless maybe you carrying it around all day , without eating you're bit over hill . so why pay extra money , unless , course , you lot shooting early morning late evening ? maybe you shouldn't , because i've doing lot photo taking both , film digital , one would expect " " lenses , photos crisp sharp . fact i keep i 17-40 camera i carry around all day , you know , one i might leave table restaurant when i got restroom . it lot less money lose someone looking five finger discount . however , my gal pal sara i take lot early morning photos . she shoots old houses , she never , ever goes out without 16-35mm . she swears it , loves it , sometimes i think better than me . so there difference , i'm kind person could happily live less expensive lense , sara not . however they both deliver gorgeous photos . you can't go wrong if lense red circle around it . jack priest , sailor home se	1
excellent product . easy get it started . great features , clear pictures . everyone sees it wants it	1
this camera excellent one !! really when you compare its price its results level quality you get you know why this best its category , i'm getting very professional results using it lot styles .. highly recommended	1
when i bought this camera sales people tried get me buy battery . they said one came it would only good 20 minutes . now i bought alot items my lifetime , 20 min battery camera just doesnt seem like very good " business " choice . so i said no . so i got camera , charged battery until light went green ( which sucked because i wanted play it right when i got it ) started taking pictures ( oh i also got 2g cf ) worked great .... so i planned go up mountain take soem scenery shots . keeping mind what sales person told me i pocketed charger just incase . well , 6000 ' , 300 pictures , 5 hours later camera still running strong , still 200 shots left trip home , battery life indicator hasnt budged off full button . so all all , i think battery life great , now i see if your taking say thousands pictures all row you may need but just going trip shooting few pictures every stop point , original work fine . quality photos ..... i love them	1
i bought sd110 camera , since i live hawaii , i underwater housing it . this housing great , because it allows you use all function buttons while camera protected housing . you power up camera , shoot , zoom , change modes everything but change battery , change memory card upload your pics onto computer while camera sealed up . i able take lots lots underwater surf pictures movies this camera . i very happy results . i treat my gear pretty rough , i water almost every day , not cleaning it all time although housing get scratched little banged up , it still worked great , it didn't affect quality my photos . then one day while rescuing swimmer distress , camera knocked off my kayak into ocean . i went back few minutes later search it . but unable find it .... i really bummed . four months later , friend friend diving same area i lost camera , saw something wedged reef , encrusted coral alge . he pulled it out took it back up boat-it digital camera housing . when he opened up housing took out camera ..... it powered right up !!!! so he took few shots boat then took camera home . he showed it his friend , they flipped through pictures he told him story finding it . one pictures i taken day i lost it , underwater self portrait . when my friend saw : he knew who camera it !!! so he calls me ... tells me story . i amazed . we figured camera housing lying bottom four months over twenty feet water , there few storms produced some very large surf area , so it likely taken beating . but it still maintained its water tight integrity . we all very amazed how durable it turned out !! i already replaced camera canon s500 it dedicated housing ( mostly so i could get higher resolution photos ) . after uploading photos onto my computer , i let guy who found it keep it . he cleaned up housing , it stays still water tight , only thing wrong it ( besides little surface crud exterior casing ) , few buttons jammed so they not work ( zoom , shutter power buttons fine ) . but not bad all camera bottom ocean several months	1

this one four cameras , only digital camera , i used learn portrait photography . class how take portraits not how use camera . i wanted graduate point shoot but consider my budget because i wanted slr film camera also . i got canon rebel ti packed two lenses . it made sense me purchase canon digital interchange lenses . my original choice canon digital rebel , however , my web search , i found eos 10d $750 no catch . there no required additional purchases scam when i called . this allowed me spend extra money i would spent camera accessories . since it digital , i am not shy trying out features . when i first got camera , some photos dark or very light . after tinkering around learning what sensor-indicators means i don't get anymore . 10d more camera than i need i'm sure i it long time .	1
i this camera years before it stolen i replaced it digital canon slr . i am still amazed abuse i put my rebel 2000 through . it nice light body , great auto feature , easy-enough use manual functions . because popularity ( rightly so ) digital these days , you pick one up fantastic price , even brand spanking new	1

canon rs-60e3 all canon says it .... it simple one handed operation switch open flash , focus , then release shutter once , multiple times , or hold it open bulb exposure . although cord not long enough include photographer picture , it simple enough make " extension " allows very remote exposures	1
it what it says it'll , while it pricey couple contact switches plastic handle , considering cost parts my time make something similar , it bargain . i would liked more heavy duty construction , contacts more definite tactile feedback focus vs shoot position , but it works just fine , it lets me take pictures while talking more easily subject , addition obvious vibration reduction	-1
canon ef 85mm 1.2 lens earned ample praise photographers critics alike one finest portrait ( medium telephoto ) lenses available . it only one currently produced maxium aperture 1.2 ( decade ago carl zeiss introduced special , limited edition 85mm 1.2 planar its contax manual focus 35mm slr system ; this lens alleged optically superior canon . ) . this new improved version 85mm 1.2 autofocus 1.8 faster than its predecessor , via usm motor relatively whisper-quiet operation . fine optic working under low-light conditions , lens now better due its improved optical design faster autofocusing . without question it one finest series canon lenses available ; these new improvements only enhance its reputation . if i owned canon equipment choose canon ef 85mm 1.2 ii usm lens or its illustrious predecessor , then without question i would willing acquire this fine new lens	1

early adopter digital , dating 1999 agfa ephoto 1280 1680 current iteration nikon family , i attest this camera flexible any my film cameras i use studio location work . fujifilm migrated best features mecanical film camera over this model . hot shoe external mounted flash sync terminal off camera flash , cable release socket shutter button , fuji melded best analog best digital . 9 mega pixel resolution , iso 80 1600 , shutter speeds 30 seconds 1/4000 , 1.6 inch ccd sensor , fujinon 28 300 mm ( 135 equivalent ) zoom , tilting lcd monitor ( if you use those things ) , raw file format support , real time histogram display , eleven shooting modes , movie recording , af assist illuminator full manual control when needed , nikon , canon , olympus , et al lot catching up . no need change lenses means sealed camera equates sensor staying spring time fresh body . no dust getting every time lens swapped ( although , i still miss all nikon glass ) . all this less than $ 600.0	1
many options this camera mechanically body camera rather than internal menu so wanting change focusing method etc easy ! shaking no problem 10.7 optical zoom warning icons appear if it may problem . icons appear if subject isn't focused warning you change focusing method . automatic power turnoff save batteries after two or five minutes , your choice . you set camera take instant pictures ; again , your choice . this camera allows you set your options rather than camera go default after power off change it back your option . problem i my previous camera . maybe little pricey , but results great !	1
i love capacity these batteries . use them my handheld gps , digital cameras , 35mm cameras , flashes , everything else i . car power adaptor really nice road trips ! charger recharge 4 batteries time ( either aa or aaa ) , charge even 2100 mah batteries under 75 minutes ( under hour " typical " rechargeables 1600 or fewer mah ) . i not like leaving charger plugged , because i hear it clicking when there no batteries it ( but i hear lots things wouldn't bother normal person ) . also , price pretty high . i succesfully used other batteries charger ( it comes 8 2100 mah nimh batteries seem last longer than other brands rechargeable ) . ask it christmas ... hope discount ( which appears pretty rare monstercable products )	-1

black color adapter hood nice match gunmetal finish s3 . fit good they what they supposed . i noticed hood tends " lock " adapter if you accidently squeeze it when unscrewing it -- probably because plastic bends little . use lighter touch it unscrews right off . one off-putting thing me price these two inexpensive pieces plastic . i know they may precision-engineered plastic nice finish , but please , over 15 dollars each two pieces ? they're plastic ! i know corporations supposedly owe it stockholders maximize profits , but perhaps these could included s2/s3 standard equipment . or sold price more line construction material	-1
very important shade camera lenses avoid flairs . it doesn't fit carrier bag designed canon s2 , s3 , though , which big time bummer . however , i would recommend it anyways , because quality pictures protection your lenses worth carrying different bag rest your stuff	-1

okay , first off , i'd like say this my first af slr -- i stepped up my dinosaur camera , canon ae-1 manual focus , right now i am quite overwhelmed all features this little thing . i'm still learning stages all this technology but let me tell you this , i am fun ! it amazes me canon offer quite impressive camera price . i just received my first few rolls developer pictures came out amazing -- so clear colors very vibrant . just let you know , i'm using 28-105mm f/ 3.5 - 4.5 usm lens . i took suggestions many passed up " kit " lens i'm sure glad i so . i would highly recommend f/ 3.5 - 4.5 lens , but unfortunately rest you , amazon discontinued it . but you could order it one many other photo shops ( bh , adorama , etc ) . i any regrets this purchase ? absolutely not ! i love this camera even though i've owned it less than month , i'm actually thinking stepping up eos 3 using this backpacking/hiking body . hmm ... what , what ? i purchase body or start collection l-series glass ? ... question .	1
hoods offer several benefits photographer . primarily hood shades lens stray light may result unwanted discoloration or hazing image , or appearance lens flare . shading your lens helps improve contrast image quality . hood not required eliminate these problems , any item used shade lens provide same protection stray light . hood convenient it built offer protection while ensuring it not inadvertently find its way into your image . photographers often state protective abilities hood reason one . this hood solid petal shaped one three quarters inch long offers limited protection keeping moisture wind blown debris off lens element . when place , hood protect lens impacting solid objects . so shallow petal shaped , even this type protection limited . even if protection limited , replacing damaged hood usually cheaper than repairing expensive lens . this hood manufactured canon 16-35mm f/ 2.8 ef normally comes included lens when sold new . there no need buy one amazon often suggests . since hood wider than lens ; it easily stored attached reverse position . this doesn't add length lens , but make it wider inch . inch may not seem like lot , but tightly packed camera bag , it huge . this lens isn't unusually wide so extra inch may not problem . while protective benefits exist , they secondary limited . i find impact hood my image quality more convincing reason use hood . considering impact image quality low cost compared my other camera equipment ( except lens case ) , purchasing hood money well spent . pros : improves contrast image quality reduces lens flare problems offers limited protection lens cons : takes up more space your camera bag store lens	-1
this lens must all beginner photographers . excellent sharpness really fast lens . i know i've heard many complain cheap feel it but less than $100 you can't beat it . yes it plastic mount , yes focus ring small but quality it pictures price make it definite winner until you decide move up much higher priced l .	-1

nikon d50 my fourth digital camera , my first slr camera . i don't know why i didn't try slr earlier , but now i decided i never go back non-slr cameras ( well , i still my other 3 point shoot digital cameras which sometime more convenient carry . ) i guess i'm just trying show how much i like slr camera . now back d50 . unless you shooting sports/actions professionaly ( which then you want buy d2h or d2x faster focusing processor , faster frames per second larger memory buffer ) , d50 pretty much all you need ( equipped several lenses course ) . d50 all pre-configured settings casual photographers ( " child " mode also added d50 , night landscape mode not available ) , it usual , , , mode more serious/advance photographer . i stopped using pre-set mode now strictly uses aperture priority shutter priority mode ( far manual mode , i'm not there yet ) . this shows this camera versatile suitable all ranges skills . comparing its siblings ( d70s , d80 , d200 ) , i think whichever you want buy fine . they all great cameras . it comes down your budget . comparing other brand like canon ( rebel xt or 30d ) , or pentax or sony , it just brand preference ( what lenses you already ) . moreover , if you come point shoot camera user , any slr brand you buy i don't think you dissapointed ( just fact slr performs better most important aspect photography ) image quality d50 good which #1 factor i look digital camera . here pros cons d50 my opinion : pros : 1 . nice out camera result picture quality ( auto setting , pre-programmed setting ) 2 . fit perfectly my hand ( grip nicely ) 3 . instant take picture right away 4 . 2.5 frames per second 5 . large 2 inch lcd 6 . battery life ( take 400-2000 shots single charge depend how often you use full power flash ) 7 . uses sd card 8 . fast usb2 connection 9 . capability copy re-size pictures small size ( great email ) 10 . repeating #1 again . great image quality cons ( which mostly minor ): 1 . no backlight top panel 2 . no black white picture mode 3 . no night landscape mode 4 . no iso 100 ( iso 1600 picture grainy though still usable)5 . no depth-of-field preview button 6 . no front command dial 7 . 1/4000 max shutter speed i started using this camera landscape portrait , but later i started shooting sports/action night ( low light ) settings , hence i added nikon 50mm f/ 1.8 af-d which great prime lens i'm recommending everyone get this " fast " lens . i'm also recommending you get nikon 70-300m f/4- 5.6 af , which nice ( price ) zoom lens . if you budget then go nikon 70-200mm f/ 2.8 vr af-s which i think best zoom lens nikon currently . ( vr really works especially stationary object . if object you want photograph moving low light situation/indoor then you need " fast " lens , i.e. lens large aperture such f/ 2.8 , f/ 1.8 , or f/ 1.4 etc)happy photographing !	1
1.4 ii teleconverter modest update canon earlier 1.4 tc . mark ii allows this extender stacked canon extenders ( either 1.4 ii or 2x ii ) without separate two extension tube ( although loss sharpness stacking extenders may not acceptable you ) . otherwise , quality newer 1.4 ii supposed very similar older model , which i've never owned . 1.4 ii great way extend reach compatible lenses . note not every canon lens compatible this extender . following canon web site : " this tele extender used fixed focal length lenses 135mm longer ( except 135mm f/ 2.8 softfocus lens ) , ef 70-200 f/ 2.8 , 70-200 f/ 2.8 , 70-200 f/ 4.0 , 100-400 f/ 4.5 - 5.6 zoom lenses . " i use it frequently my canon 70-200mm f/ 2.8 , which turns it into 98-280mm zoom . extra reach it adds not tremendous , but it very welcome when i just need little more than what lens alone give me . i've found no appreciable loss sharpness using 1.4 . course , any extender going reduce sharpness some degree , but normal examination , i can't distinguish photos taken 70-200mm use 1.4 those don't . fact 70-200mm f/ 2.8 very sharp lens begin helps this department . using 1.4 decreases your lens ' widest aperture ' capability ' one stop . some lenses , more significant than it appears surface ; when using non-pro canon body ( such my 20d ) lens must minimum wide-open aperture ' capability ' f/ 5.6 autofocus work . lens doesn't set f/ 5.6 , it just ' capable ' least f/ 5.6 after adjusting one stop loss 1.4 . means some camera/lens combinations , adding 1.4 force you focus all your shots manually . ( note : there known ' fix ' this restores autofocus . i've never needed try it , but it involves taping over some connector pins 1.4 fool camera body . proceed caution if you try this , google search learn how it right before attempting it . ) 1.4 also reduces focus speed very slightly . i've only used it my 70-200mm , which canon usm fast-focusing lens begin , but decrease speed so slight i really don't notice it . it not affect ( image stabilization ) all . 1.4 built quality canon l-series lenses , which means it weather sealed keep canon pro body l-series lens weather sealed when used them . if you're considering this extender , you're probably also considering canon 2x ii teleconverter . i not own 2x but lot research it before ultimately deciding go 1.4 . 2x decreases your aperture two stops , reported noticable decrease sharpness -- more than some photographers willing live . other hand , i've never read review complained loss sharpness 1.4 . if you've already invested lot money telephoto lenses , 1.4 ii relatively inexpensive way get even more reach ( value ) out your investment while adding only modest amount bulk your camera bag . highly recommended	1
it what it supposed . nothing more , nothing less . if it little cheaper , i would given it 5 stars .	-1
this good tool , job well , serves purpose , but little overpriced canon keeps changing connectors , forcing us buy new accessories which wrong practice against consumer . i give 4 star because canon , not because product . if you willing pay it , it good product .	-1
hello all , lens hoods pretty much necessity , but this mostly poorly made hood i've ever used . unlike other hoods screw , this one requires you press opposing clips then slide hood one , release clips . this leads problems alignment , meaning both sides clip need perfectly aligned order hood fit right . although it pain i hate ... i don't really alternative . either go w/o hood , or take this one . either way , guess i'd rather hood lense than not one	-1
it works great my ef 50mm f/ 1.8 ii lens . price this hood ring seems pricy compare lens price , but it job when it really needed .	-1
i use this all time my son soccer games get great shots . it little bigger side , but isn't too heavy image stabilization really helps out	1
i originally purchased 30d low-end kit lens - me pricing didn't really make sense get either body or higher-end kit lens . i looking good all-purpose zoom full-size sensor covereage case i move up canon ranks new pro-level model future . 28-135 fits bill nicely . although it fairly heavy , difference build image quality 18-55 kit lens incomparable . this lens takes beautiful pictures operates flawlessly . i highly recommend it day-to-day lens , nice feature extending range down few stops without moving up much more expensive faster lenses	1
my existing battery aged i started look forward replacement . after i read several reviews , i preferred choose original one , because heating performance problems . therefore , i found good bundle price if i'd selected cord , battery case my sd100 camera . way , i not good case this new one . i rated 4 stars , because i preferred stay original cord	-1
after researching numerous websites looking canon fitted case my new camera , i again turned amazon found just what i looking lowest price . leather case fits well isn't bulky , just protective . now i don't worry damaging camera dumping it my purse everything else so it always handy impromptu shots . neat , comfortable neck strap just added bonus	1
i ordered this camera december , it since then , it amazing camera . first time i ever professional camera , it takes time learn how use it . it not point shoot camera . if you want large pictures like crop , this may not camera you . however if you want ability take great pictures , learn how use professional camera great price this one buy . ability custom curves , which means predetermined parameters different conditions . ability chage iso random different conditions . you pay five thousand dollars its successor , dx2 , however $2000 this bargin you never find again . jim comfor	1
i bought this trip not only it fit my purpose but it makes camera look even cooler than it already looks . i several people stop me ask me what it so i got chance explain how it benefited me	1
i took plunge bought bg-e3 battery grip canon . after reading reviews off-brand model deciding i didn't want any ' button ' problems , i got canon . i'm very happy it , ( not standpoint extra battery capacity because i 2 batteries all times anyway ) but because i like ' look feel ' additional weight fit my large male hands . i felt without it , i might drop camera any time while it safely suspended my neck , i don't like feeling . i also like able spin camera portrait or landscape shots very quickly cleanly extra set buttons available change tv av settings various effects . i got some exceptionally nice photos waterfall this made it easy use . if you're thinking buying it , it worth every hard-earned penny should significantly enhance both professional amateur uses	1
my 2 year old really active my point shoot camera cannot keep up him . i also don't like washout look when i uses flash . so i researched which slr best meet my needs , mainly catching fast action , candid moments low light photos without flash . canon 30d comes up top list . it best high iso performance its class ( better than nikon sony ) . when i combine 30d fast zoom lens ef-s 17-55 mm f/ 2.8 , result amazing . i stop any action daylight , capture every candid expression my 2 yr old fast burst mode , take indoor or night photos without using flash or tripod . portraits also excellent sharp image beautifully blurred background ( bokeh ) . even dimly-lit decors disneyland haunted mansion came out superb when we went there halloween party night , without flash or tripod . this really important factor me buy this camera , taking pictures tripod not option when your subject active 2 yr old . but you need good lens make this work well . if you use cheap kit lens , then it probably not matter which camera you pick . remember these 3 all very good cameras small differences image quality you see reviews apparent only when they use best prime lens ( not kit lens)and crop pictures magnify details . sony very good choice if you budget don't need low light performance ( use flash save money ) . nikon more custom function than canon , it really good canon . they both their strength weakness . canon just happens slightly better high iso performance suits my need better than nikon . fair , i should mention nikon d200 tops most reviews camera year , beating canon 30d overall . but d200 bit too advanced amateur like me , better suits someone more serious photography . d80 like " mini " d200 , but slower . so it really boils down what you really need how much you want spend . shooting low light without flash need good high iso performance , good fast lens ( wide aperture , usually expensive ) , image stabilization . if that what you want , canon 30d ef-s 17-55 mm f/ 2.8 not disappoint you	1
this camera incredible . i ordered it my husbands birthday he just begining figure it all out . there so many great features . one best how quickly you take digital pictures . our other digital cameras lag time shots , but not this one . pictures crisp it easy even novice like me use . i highly recommend this camera if you want take digital photography next level . it one best	1

i just received this birthday present , am very happy display . i seen some digital photo frames during black friday sales , but all them very lousy displays images looked very pixelated . this one looks great . 720x480 resolution very suitable , 6.5 " diagonal size perfect desktop frame , although it bit small if you wanted hang it wall . there two areas improvement . first mac support . i'm mac user , while it shows up desktop usb drive allowing pictures dragged dropped it , it would nice see some iphoto integration . specifically , i'd like see custom export plugin where i simply select photos or album iphoto , then it would automatically scale them down 720x480 copy them onto internal storage frame . documentation doesn't even make mention mac support all , they should least state it used mac document alternatives getting your pictures displayed , even if they don't provide any software . secondly , controls frame itself bit awkward . i think some work some human-computer interaction experts coud improved interface . i able accomplish what i needed , but there definite areas improvemnt . real differentiator these days display quality , i would definitely recommend this product others i've looked . mac support frame controls minor inconvenience , best	-1

unlike rest reviewers here , i bought this camcorder store singapore . this gave me huge advantage try out camera before i bought it ! i paid us $450.00 ca6 [ which included all required cables , 2 cd-roms software , carrying case , 2 batteries { one 1.5 -hour one 3-hour battery } , 4gb ultra high-speed sd card , 2 tripod mounts { no charge } , multi-port usb hub 4 different types sd cards , power cords adapter u.s. singapore voltages ] . after reading all reviews here i agree some " cons " comments . yes , it not come tripod mount hole . however , salesperson gave me two black plastic tripod mounts free . it fits like glove -- no problems . sorry , i don't know where find these u.s. but i'm sure they're out there somewhere . yes , hand strap useless . seriously , throw it away ! it not worth effort . my wife gave me her camera strap use it fed through bottom ring works much better . only way protect lcd screen camera lens keep it carrying case when not use . this case real convenience metal ring could attach belt loop my shorts or pants . lot people complaining low light situations . i haven't noticed too much this . salesperson told me this " sports " model version . i shown several other models sanyo similar ca6 . this gave me impression ca6 geared more towards outdoor use it proved itself worthy . it small camcorder so it took few days get used filming it . plus , i'm left-handed used it like stubborn left-hander my left hand -- but i finally got used it . i know it wasn't designed this mind . however , i think it gave me advantage over right-handers bigger fingers . i didn't worry using all buttons hold camcorder same time . i know this sounds funny but if you're left-hander you might appreciate this info . yes , i am one those who use two hands dial phone number or play games my little cellphone , hehe . oh , using highest quality dvd setting video gives you 2 hours 45 minutes 4gb sd card . sure get some type camera strap this device -- not one provided [ i think this sanyo afterthought ] . i realized this one day i 100 feet up skyride singapore . i dangling my feet , i wondered how awful it would ca6 slip out my hand watch it shatter into 1,000 pieces below me .	1
we bought this camera right before going vacation found it extremely handy convenient . we took great video great pictures it . here some advantages disadvantages we found : advantages : 1 . very small compact - it small camera bag attached my belt . it ready moments notice take video pictures . i able take it places regular camera would likely not go ( roller coaster ride , water ride ) . it all times my hip very handy , it never got way . 2 . water resistant - our last camera went dead because humidity water . i took this camera water ride my son , filmed whole thing , got soaked , no problems camera . 3 . great outdoor pictures - excellent looking pictures outdoors . doors good if there enough light . flash very poor not go very far ( understandable given small compact battery ) . 4 . lots settings - even this small camera , there plenty settings ( wind reduction , noise reduction , image stabilization , iso settings , exposure , flash , white balance , etc . ) 5 . video compression - i found video compression not good minidv tape , but still extremely good , given i could record 1.5 2 hours video my single 2gb sd card ( we also bought exta , which easily fit bag)6 . battery - small battery , total time not last long ( 1 hour ) , but we could carry several other batteries our bag ( same one attached my hip ) never lost out because battery failure ( we 4)7 . flip screen - all you flip screen out , camera , ready go pictures or video . it one hand . same shutting it off . disadvantages : 1 . no view finder - only screen see what you videoing , however i amazed how well i could see screen even direct sunlight . 2 . low light pictures - like i said , flash poor not put out much power . there " candle " setting helps take pictures dark places , but you keep camera very steady because it keeps aperture open longer . 3 . cables - one more cable add my stash . it type usb one end ( computer ) new plug ( not sure what it called ) used both video out put usb output . however , i never use this given my laptop sd slot so all i remove card slip it into laptop download everything . 4 . pistol grip - first this way awkward , but time i learned hold it very comfortably still operate everything just fine . got keep tabs your index finger it easy place it over lense . i held it much more comfortably after i began using strap , which i put over my hand , more questionable situations , i strapped it over my wrist . 5 . zoom - only 5x zoom , it little slow zooming , but actually made playback look smoother , so pick your poison . 6 . photos while video shooting - while you take photo during video recording , it freeze video few seconds while it records picture . nice , but i thought video would still seemless . i usually don't use this feature , but it turned out handy . 7 . non-swivel screen - screen flips out , but not swivel any other direction . open or closed ( closed position , screen visible open possible damage . this made it little harder film things times where i wasn't directly behind camera . we love camera , so glad we it . quality near minidv , software we use ( nero 7 ) works great mp4 snap turn into dvd . only reason we gave it 4 rating instead 5 due few small disadvantages it plain simple fact camera features not replace all features you would find dedicated digital camera . but you bought it video , right ? so how i complain 80% excellent quality i got pictures i take ? hence 4 out 5 . end , we got more video footage than we would larger video camera simple fact its wonderfully small size	-1

this charger main selling points : 1 . it 4 separate independent charging circuits , each able charge 1 battery time , 2 . batteries barely warm up during charging . heat what kills nimh batteries , so low temp feature grea t.t he first unit i bought two defective circuits began act up after weak use , where it either not terminate charge or it would terminate far too prematurely . i should returned it exchange , but didn't because i lost receipt . anyway , i bought second unit it worked fine so far . besides defective circuits , one minor nuisance design if you insert cell slot charging current would only come if cell above some minimum voltage . some my nicad nimh cells , cells sometimes experience temporary polarity reversal or very low voltage after prolonged storage . no matter how many times these cells inserted mach 1 charger , charging circuitry would not come . i think this safety feature insure dead cells won't charged , but it frequently weeds out batteries perfectly good but some reason either experienced temporary voltage reversal or fall below cutoff voltage . charge these apparent duds , one needs " dumb charger " doesn't safety circuitry first revive cells give them positive voltage before putting them mach 1 . negative mach 1 design cells usually less than fully charged when unit finishes charging . reason this cells heat up quite dramatically near full charge , so it sacrifices fullness charge cell longevity not charging cells fullness order keep them cool . note 1-hr . charging time based 2000 mah batteries . if you put batteries less or more capacity , charge times proportionally change	-1
this holiday present my son ( dad expecting use it too ! ) , whose handheld games eat batteries prodigious rate . it already hit today ( dec . 25 ) regard . ( i bought dozen maya powerex 2300 aa cells addition those supplied lenmar . powerexes very highly rated user reports , but also bit pricier than average . ) previously noted others , unit ships batteries insulated charger terminals thin strip clear ( all but invisible , fact ) plastic . this should really " pull tail " it , or note stuck unit saying " please remove insulator before use " or some such , i bet they get tons doa reports people who just plug unit supplied cells still place expect it start right up . description this unit amazon page says it comes four 2000 mah cells , though time i placed order , 2300s/2400s quite common . i figured , no big deal regard . i pleasantly surprised when unit arrived four 2300 mah cells ! course , compensate this , one four supplied cells turned out dud would not charge . unit seems work advertised . " one-hour " theoretical charge time 1800 mah cells . unit charged two supplied 2300s 75 minutes , third cell took 90 minutes . ( you charge individual cells any combination any four slots . ) individual red led indicators initally come after cell insertion , during rapid charging , then go out again when cells nearly full trickle-charged . if serious problem battery , its led flash , or case excessively-drained , dead cell , led not come all upon battery insertion . note this ( led dark ) looks very much like normal indication battery finished charging , so you make sure lights initally come each cell you insert it . it too bad dead cells don't also cause flashing error warning . while any cell rapid-charging , unit internal fan runs . this normally audible , but not excessive , whooshing air noise . ( manual states not run unit if fan not operational . hopefully unit also its own thermal auto-shutdown protection this possibility failsafe ! ) case my unit , fan blades striking inside case , so fan noise like cross cicada really noisy electric razor . probably cause warranty return , but i would prefer not going through hassle if it avoided . gently flexing plastic case loosening case screws bit give top smidgeon more clearance , i managed eliminate noise . contrary other reports , i observed batteries became noticeably warm during rapid-charging phase , but not overly so . pros -- * use charging slots individually , any combination * very good " intelligent " charging performance * comes both ac 12v car adaptors * supplied decent-capacity aa cellscons -- * ( minor ) should warn user batteries ship insulated * should more specific led warning severely-drained ( " dead " ) cells * can't leave cells trickle-charge indefinitely ( manual recommends removing cells after 4 hours max ) so unit needs somewhat attended when use * minor flaws my particular unit ( one dead supplied cell , fan buzzing against case ) probably not common , but it could indicate quality control tolerances bit tight . note most " cons " simply require using unit correctly , so long you careful user , this unit should very well most uses . -- jm	-1

this first time i purchased product tiffen . i'm using this uv protection filter mainly protection my new lens , i assume most people purchase uv filter same reason . main drive me choose this product because reduced price 10-year warranty . simple uv filter , there aren't any extra effects except advertised quot ; helps eliminate bluish cast images . quot ; my prints just came back , i can't really see too much difference my untrained eyes	-1
if you're thinking buying this camera ... i few things you concious beforehand . 1 ) if you're going taking sports pictures ( your kids , or whoever ! ) you're indoors our outdoors darker day or under lights , camera not take any decent pictures . they're all too dark . this one big disappointment me , regardless if you're sportsmode ( this acutally makes it worse ) or just taking photo normal mode .. it doesn't come out . if this one major thing you're planning doing camera i would re-consider . 2)the zoom isn't what it could -- times it little frustrating how little distance 3x really . just thought . overall , i love camera . i highly recommend getting big memory card so you go long weekend/vacation without worrying going over	-1
i bought dsc 200 last year , after spending thousands hours reading these reviews !!! i've never better camera . so , thanks everyone who reviewed this camera , recommended it . this camera takes credible photos inside car , window closed , going 60mph ! it fits your pocket , stays charged up days . there lots features i still not figured out , but all you need point , click you get great photo	1
i bought this camera six months ago my 12 year old daughter . it her ( ours ) first digital camera . i read so many reviews prior selecting this model . reviews this camera so helpful . this camera so easy use it takes excellent pictures . rechargeable batteries definitely must ! this camera best camera this price , no doubt it . we taken still shots videos . it so fun option take video . we some great clips . all i say we so happy camera . we would definitely choose it again	1
cute , compact , easy use - these just few ways describe canon cool a400 ! this stylish digital camera lightweight perfect snapping shots go . mine sunset gold . plus , there perks like macro mode ( which lets you snap sharp pictures close 2 inches ) , lots shooting modes ( like snow fireworks ) . movie mode lets you capture video clips sound . this camera takes great , crisp photos . it easy use , great value . just what you would expect canon	1
this camcorder incredible high definition picture quality it very easy use . it very small makes it very convenient carry it you everywhere . because small size it bit difficult beginning handle it well control zoom but after some time you getting used it no problem . lack hdmi , microphone input minor shortcomings this camera you also hd quality your tv component connection you very rarely need use external microphone small non professional camcorder like this . contrary theoretical characteristics , it shoots great low light indoor environments . very low light environments there flash light . image quality general under any circumstances it just perfect . only serious weakness motor noise tape recorded other sounds microphone sillent environments . other environment sounds captured great very detail . battery also limited but second one you easily solve this problem . however not using player mode much avoiding integrated screen shoot , one battery pack could enough one day moderate use . i think it perfect camera general purpose .	1
everything i need hd camcorder . select good capturing software or work mac get best results video . controls easily used one hand	1
decided get this battery utilize original battery spare . however , this battery , we never needed spare . recent trip hawaii , this only one we used . through long days diamond head , waikiki , dole pineapple plantation , polynesian cultural center , day trip big island , this battery never ran low . recharging day end only thing needed . great performance	1
i hate spending more money battery , but one came my elura 85 pathetic -- it very short battery life . this one much better	1
twice capacity ( physical size ) stock battery supplied compatible canon camcorders , bp-2l14 offers extended filming time single charge exceed capacity digital tape cartridge , even if using lcd screen instead viewfinder . although bp-2l14 larger than battery it replaces inch thick ( just double thickness ) , added size doesn't interfere filming or carrying camera . rather than carrying around handful lower-capacity nb-2lh , add bl-2l14 or two your inventory instead	1
i previously used mainly manual film cameras , but cost developing film made it difficult take hundreds pictures needed learn how take good ones . i recently bought d40 which great camera learning . i taken 1000 pictures last two weeks probably learned more time than i months using film camera . i large hands , so i suprised how this small camera fits well it . screen large very clear . availability few new cheap lenses alson makes this easy wallet , while allowing newbie like myself learn basics . i highly recomment this camera	1
digital slr kit lens this small light weight camera takes beautiful photos simple use auto . beginner slr user i can't emagine better buy .	1
absolutely fantastic . also works new generation sony camcorders ( dvd308 , 508 , etc .	1
this underwater casing wonderful ! i took it record video my sony dvd-405 camcorder while snorkeling mayan riviera coast mexico . other casings this camcorder cost much more ($800 ) , but they rated much greater depth scuba diving . it very easy use : first , attach bottom plate ( provided kit ) camcorder , second , hook-up camcorder cable provided ( don't forget turn viewfinder around ) , third , slide camcorder into casing , fourth , grease o-ring , put desiccation pad , apply non-fog liguid . then , just close case , press outside power button start recording . i amazed quality how easy it use . we good light , clear water lots fish video . best video filmed mid-afternoon sunlight coming angle . we took casing down depth 12 feet but we filmed fish stingreays who water deep 30 feet still got good pictures . casing floats surface without any weight attached it . i no problem recording moving camera around under water . viewfinder works differently than recording without casing takes few minutes get used it . snorkeling pictures , just few feet below surface , using this casing produces great quality great value	1
i know sony already great reputation , but i impressed this product . it small light-weight , but it pretty bright . it also auto function ( just like flash ) , so if you're not sure when you'll need it , you just use function . my camera doesn't built-in flash , so it works well video still shots . it tad pricey , but it sony	1
pros : - brighter than expected small light- price- really helps low light , even cam performs well low light- no batteries - draws camcons : - drains cam battery - you may need bigger battery camthis light what i hoping , fill dark areas low light , particularly peoples faces . this makes much more pleasant videos my family friends . downside home videos your subject often not like harsh brightness shining them . it really bright when pointed you . i started selective when i really need light because it so conspicuous often i want video sideline capture " natural " expressions without neusance . value this light pretty high me . price paid benifit my videos very good	1
after careful review hands-on comparisons canon xha1 , sony v1u , panasonic vastly overrated hvx200 , jvc hd110 , i opted canon xha1 . surprisingly , v1u quite " noisy " all settings , appearing no better quality than my obsolete trv900 . apparently , 24p v1 this moment un-editable most nle except sony mediocre " vegas " software . until 16gb or 32gb p2 card introduced drastically reduced price ( unlikely ) hvx vs film camera comparisons seem justified only cost each precious minute astronomical cost celluloid . jvc lacks auto focus feature , which fine long you've got camera crew tow complete professional focus puller . bottom line , canon optics second none . xha1 low price answer canon flagship xlh1 , same camp , far superior camera this bunch . standing ovation amazon overnight delivery xha1 , which arrived pristine condition time promised	1
camera very nice , still images quality very high . software not so good , it not get normal dvd support videos . i paid two days service because i needed my camera , but after two days i not receive package , i contacted ups office i go ups offices three times , third i got my package , terrible service	-1

i love size style this little camera bag . it only single compartment shoulder strap nice long . long enough use around waist fanny pack . bag itself isn't padded inside it rather stiff . tight fit my camera , but good protection i think . i just wanted keep my camera getting scratched up this trick nicely	-1

owner canon digital camera , i high expectations a710 . model i owned before this one powershot a60 2.0 megapixel . there few key features made me very satisfied . main two : 7.1 megapixels , 6x optical zoom , which obvious high quality due canon . feature somewhat ' unique ' this camera color swapping mode(allows you swap color anyother color , i.e. turn red car into blue one , change wall colors ... ) coupled powerful software provided , this camera ideal any individual looking well rounded camera user friendly controls . ** would not recommend first time digital camera user however *	1
special latin american people : soy de venezuela tuve el inmenso placer de comprar esta camara las pasadas navidades , traves de mi tarjeta de credito un currier que me llevo la camara hasta la puerta de mi casa en valencia venezuela , supero todas mis expectativas en cuanto calidad precio , cuenta con garantia internacional , una bateria recargable que realmente es duradera , la calidad de las fotos impresas es realmente extraordinaria , cuenta con un sinfin de opciones que hacen de la exilin ex-z600 una excelente selccion , la recomiendo cualquiera con los ojos cerrados digan whisky !!!!!	1
i lot research digital cameras before making purchase . probably 50 hours [ ... ] [ ... ] price checks 10 different websites asked everyone i knew what they liked didn't like their cameras . i am so happy i picked this one . it very lightweight yet durable , sleek attractive if that what you want . large viewfinder great asset . great zoom capabilities although i say picture quality ( screen , anyway ) somewhat compromised ( gets little grainy ) max zoom . i probably only use 6 or 7 " best shot " modes regular basis but it fun experiment them all . very long battery life . i took this camera 7-night cruise didn't recharge it all . i 2 friends who ready buy new cameras they going get this one	1
i love just everything this camera . it nice small , it easy use , it takes nice photos . but , i haven't figured out yet how get good night photos , ' though , i've used " best shots " ( feature camera ) . i've it 3 months am still learning it . but , all all , i love this little camera . price right , it what you want it if you get camera sun shield , any camera store ( $19.00 ) , you'll glad you	-1
i found this camera very easy use photos come out clear good qualty . i yet explore all extra added modes features but i very happy it so far . would recommend it .	1
i purchased hd1a model returned it since i made aware new model soon coming out . honestly although i want so much love this camera , i am disappointed decided send it back video quality not measure up my old sony p350 , camera stills not measure up my wedding camera , which canon 30d . then i started thinking . i pass up taking my sony or canon anywhere because they not small enough it not bother . i realized now my sanyo , i actually take it my man purse me everywhere i go so now i get shots footage i never got before . what good great camera if you leave it home ? point , my sanyo just great if i just except it not take professional level hd video pics just little grainy indoors even flash . casual use , this sanyo missing link . i least improve video stills software if it becomes critical , but my wife , once i stop expecting her superwoman , i realize how amazing she really . this camera best hybrid out there macro mode blows me away . it worth it i am keeping it	1
i love this thing ! it holds not only camera , dock paper , it hold small thing too !	1

i purchased this case hdr-hc3 camcorder , first case seemed enormous . camcorder only 1/3rd size main compartment ! granted my cam much smaller than most sony , but most ( if not all ) handycams should fit quite well . nicely-designed ' false bottom ' , you pretty much pack everything you think into this elegant case . i able fit all my accessories ( cables : component , dv , usb , power ) , travel tripod , few spare tapes , spare battery ease . finish this case absolutely incredible . highly recommended	1

without doubt , if canon not make best digital cameras out there , least it makes most popular digital cameras . s400 s410 first two which made cannon so successful digital camera market . later sd series definitely push canon no . 1 digital camera seller us world(sorry , kodark yields canon this year hp considering leave this market ) . so far , i am still happy my choice made 3 years ago . i used this camera almost daily , taking over 12,000 pictures already using this s410 . it still strong , except few scratch body . i am satisfied picture quality . before this one , i used fuji , kodark also used other nikon , i would say , s410 still best use gives best quality . if considering next digital camera , i would take even smaller size canon sd series without question . this camera not perfect , anyway . but please tell me , which one ? it might not never one . however , it good enough me . specificly , cons s410 : startup not fast , focusing sometimes takes longer time than expected . not good contiguous shooting . also i got famous e18 error after two years heavy use . lucky enough , i just tap it against table problem gone . other than , it so far so good me carry it use it everyday	-1
anyone here remember kodak royal gold ? well this film same thing , just re-packaged spiffy new " hd " box . overall quality prints made this film pretty darn sharp , even cloudy days . note some situations bright subjects result cartoonish colors which seem bleed into each other . grain minimal far amateur based film concerned , my opinion it outperforms fuji superia x-tra 400 . considering kodak uc400 now available various common department stores 2 dollars more , i'm ditching hd far less grainy professional uc line film	-1
i bought this camera month ago our trip roatan , honduras . my wife i avid snorkelers we wanted inexpensive camera ( not throw aways ) take great pics sea life vibrant colors we see through our mask . this camera one . divers our resort blown away clarity each picture . also , pics i took land excellent well . one pics i've posted ( sunset ) now desktop background one my co-workers . i read every review this camera before i bought it when i saw pics reviewer hawaii , i sold . i hope my pics help .	1
small size rugged construction makes this camera very practical traveling . availability numerous settings enables capturing high quality pictures under various conditions . this camera produced many excellent photographs	1
i own various digital cameras , cheap point shoot pricey slr small camera , this one great . 10x optical zoom camera fits your pocket awesome . i took it wildlife sanctuary 10.3 meg slr , pictures this camera almost good those taken 300mm zoom slr ( least 4x6 8x10 , i didnt try anything bigger yet ) . easy navigate screens , loaded options . i would definitely buy it again . dont let other brands 3x 5x optical , plus digital zoom fool you . digital zoom degrading pixels . this one buy if you want camera fits your pocket zoom close .	1
this best digital camera i've owned . first , i believe camera should fit into my jeans pocket so it me when photo opportunities arise . it not smallest camera market any means , but it fits comfortable into my levis . i use this camera all time . second , zoom amazing . 10x optical zoom camera fits my pocket ! because camera built image stabilization , deeply zoomed pictures look terrific . third , my wife finds it easy use . this says lot . i'm techie , but she thinks dials menus intuitive easy / quick use . fourth , camera takes 16:9 aspect ratio movies ( or regular 4:3 if you prefer ) . image quality much better than i expected . image stabilizer probably helps improve quality , but i played videos our 42 " tv . quality appears just good our normal cable signal . definitely not hd , but good enough share short videos friends tv more than sufficient emails youtube postings . fifth , we very pleased image quality . because we amateurs , we take pictures under all sorts less than ideal conditions ( low light , moving subjects cameras , long zoom shots rocking boats , etc . ) . this camera sharpness , colors , details better than any other digital cameras we've owned over last ten years . pro might not satisfied , but we . sixth , it works great iphoto , mail , iweb , imovie our mac , so sending pictures or videos via email , making webpages them , or editing them into movies / slideshows very , very easy . battery life sufficient , but i would rather it took standard batteries ( aa or aaa ) so i wouldn't bring charger vacation . charger small , but takes valuable space tight suitcases . first , i not thrilled manual lens cap . however , i veiwed this camera store before buying amazon . salesperson convinced me integrated / automatic covers provide less protection likely places mechanical failure . big lens lets lumix pull such massive zoom definitely needs good protection .	1
absolutly love this camera , dont tyink its worth how much its up , maybe little over priced , but absolutly greaqt non less . never single problem . pictures come out great . however , pictures come out tad blurry when flash not . but other than , fabulous	1
easy use , works described , compact , whole kodak easyshare system dream well designed	1
this item recommended me my daughter . she explained it actually easier cheaper than buy batteries camera . i keep my camera sitting dock , so it always ready use . i recently took camera dock vacation me it always ready me take picture . it not available local stores , so i very happy i could order it amazon	1
works advertised . aware when using flash lens it cast shadow picture . also your view through view finder partially blocked , but you always use lcd screen	-1
i bought this kodak easyshare c360 it worked perfectly , just i needed , charged battery lasts very long time .... product just described	1
it just what i looking . i thought price right also , it less expensive then retail	-1
this product delivers exactly promised we could not more pleased . pictures wonderful . initial downloading process straighforward problem-free . we actually purchased three photo frames ourselves our children they love them much we . slideshow feature wonderful well . everyone our friends seen photo frame equally amazed this product some not aware such product even existed . sure , they expensive but worth cost . we enjoy our photo frame years come we update new pictures regularly . thanks folks philips getting this soooooooooooo right .	1
excellent item protects my digital camera well ; nice sized external pocket carry extra batteries ( 4 aa ) extra memory card . very durable still looks new after 2.5 years use . taken it india/abu dhabi back well all over us still hold up well .	1
well aside what said , i say velcro part could annoying , however it big secure enough make you feel safe avg user who wants just camera nothing more professional , extra storage batteries your usb cable . all all , better then nothing good value . you wont feel need get rid it anytime soon	1
this camera really good , easy use , macro mode , i like take pictures collectibles watches , really awesome images you get . i also canon digital xt , 100 mm macro lens , light box ; well some pictures i took this a430 camera , almost same quality ones i got more expensive equipment	1
i lot research before buying this cam . mix features quality supported my purchase , if i needed cam i would buy this one again	1
we purchased this camera several children christmas presents . it easy enough use out box 7yr older , however menu system bit difficult navigate more gadget-oriented kids fared bit better . response kids great , it several key advantages over slightly cheaper keychain type cameras . it supports external memory card ( sd ) , flash , doesn't lose pictures if batteries die or removed . usb connection ( windows xp ) worked fine without needing install any additional drivers . less than $40 it great present , picture quality sufficient most " snapshot " applications , feature list rich enough allow kids learn something digital photgraphy . we not tried web-cam feature or recorded movies so not know what video quality like	-1
mostly plastic , spindly parts lack smooth motion . mine came broken out box - plastic cap screw which holds eyepieces place shattered . better spend your money higher quality product	-1
i wanted 10x50 long time watching stars . ideally you should buy binocular bak4 prism astronomy ( this comes porro prism ) . bak4 ones sell higher price . price i saw this one ($26+free shipping ) , i thought i give this try anyway . it not disappoint . it comes carry case . it over month since purchase . still working good	-1
it great stand money . it didn't work right out box , ( this only reason i give it 4 instead 5 stars ) but some serious elbow grease some wd-40 stands now work just fine . money though , it very versatile package that neatly transported single bag	-1
pros : this truly high end digital without bulk dslr . great feel features . it slow first standard sd card , but installed very fast , sandisk extreme iii ( 20mb/sec . ) digic 3 processor instantly unleashed . now it performs i hoped . i think reviews would better if they used faster cards . shutter lag gone i take continuous shots amazing speed . menus controls excellent . movies great , too . cons : no raw ( if you need it ) . red-eye similar all close flash cams , but easily removed included software . no zoom during vide o.o ther thoughts : g7 smaller lighter than reviews say . it really feels like camera , not tiny toy . battery life not bad so far ... likely buy spare . oh ... it takes very nice photos , too .	1
after switched 3 cameras 2 years , i think i safely say this perhaps best pro-am camera around best value money . very easy use pictures very close real thing .	1
great camera , just chosen editor choice pc mag well . [ ... ] i it 3 weeks now , couple family parties later i am really happy this little one . fits even tight jeans pockets , quick take pictures . face recognition works really well , not flawless , but really amazing . i took 300 shots so far they mostly great quality , some indoor pictures without flash bit blurry , if you don't hold it steady . my 4 year old niece running around it took nice shots just her own automatic setting , pretty amazing . flash bit strong when close indoors . it takes fast pictures very easy understand . i still read manual , though . ;-) i added fast 2gb card even video quality pretty good , althought just avi format , not mpg . sound great . it even speaker when you play video review . outside pictures outstanding quality . i some outside self-timer family pictures enlarged store 20-30cm , picture quality awesome . highly recommended when you want camera you carry you all times	1
canon all way ! i've s230 , sd300 , sd400 , sd630 . i really not like feel sd630 very much after living it while . i also didn't like button placements .. not comfortable it . it take great pics video . but , i moved sd1000 ( black ) , it one week love it ! all canon point-and-shoot digitals , this my favorite . it tiny so pocketable . pleasure use . switches buttons where they should feel good . screen 2.5 so people who want 3.0 need go sd750 which basically sd630 replacement digic iii processor . same form factor . if you liked sd200 , sd300 , sd400 , sd450 or sd600 , you love this ! my only reservation how great pics this little camera . i'm sure they excellent but jury out how good they compared earlier canons . i like vivid pics so i may set camera vivid . got good deal amazon	1
i owned canon powershot s-series ( s330 ) , a-series ( a540 , a570is ) s2 . i wanted 28mm wide angle point shoot , so i bought this because canon sd800 outrageously priced . i'm canon fanatic , so prepared multiple comparisons . however this camera worth crossing over panasonic . pros - i definitely enjoy 28mm feature . bright rear display wonderful , os quite intuitive well . also it gets great battery life . ~ 300 shot estimate specs pretty realistic . cons - compared canon cameras this my conclusion - all canon camera much truer white balance presets . even red blue fine tuning options , indoor dim lighting really hard , snow lighting . this camera takes much more saturated contrasty photos than canons . even when fx01 set less-vivid , it way more saturated than canon most vivid setting . end result dramatic unrealistic photo sometimes . ccd noise issue . this camera sensor much noisier than canons ' . nothing dramatic deal-breaking , but don't expect same crisp , clean shots canon take . finally panasonic image stabilization . it really not hold its own against canon . i used 570 handheld shots 1/4 second , sometimes longer , decent results . same goes s2 ( which i highly recommend digital camcorder/super zoom hybrid ) . panasonic sensor doesn't seem match iso standards you set it , it wants slower shutter speeds 2.8 iso 100 than canon set same f-stop iso . so , despite fx01 mega ois , its longer shutter speeds mean you still get shake you wouldn't equivalent canon . i know canon , canon , canon . well , i told you i'm biased . after reading these cons , why would you get this ? it 1/2 price sd 800 ( if you shop around ) it must city photos , big landscapes ( skies look so cool wide angle ) it vital indoor group shots ! buy it , but don't expect world it	-1
i spend hours pouring over reviews trying decide which ultracompact best deal best overall camera . end , it came down panasonic fx01 cannon sd600 . i read warnings other reviewers panasonic images weren't top quality , but i chose ignore those reviewers because paper fx01 looks like it would out perform sd600 . i wrong . after using fx01 few days i knew what those other reviewers talking - grainy photo after grainy photo . i really really wanted this camera great , but it just wasn't . actually , my old 3mp camera took better shots then 6mp fx01 ! very disappointing . i ended up returning this camera amazon ( very easy-great service ) because poor image quality . i mean , wanting good photographs why you take photos , right ? i know someone sd600 he very happy quality . judging customer images sd600 page amazon , i think i should've gone cannon	-1
i love this item i recommended anythings . me encanta lo recomiendo para cualquier usuari	1
this kindof impulse buy . i originally went buy kodak easyshare but it sold out so i got next affordable one which this one i say i thinking taking it back because i hadn't researched it but after trying it out reading manual i changed my mind it works perfectly all functions work , flash ontime , it simple it looks great ! i've it one week so far nothing gone wrong but we'll see so far i'm love w/this cam .. not taking it back .	1
ok , so i bought this camera because friend exilim z700 , i loved features . i wasn't quite prepared what i got . this camera amazing ; i love it carry it everywhere i go : take photos myself friends , take video funny things i see streets , record rehearsals performances even auditions ( it vocal recorder records 49 hours !!! ) . there so many uses i've found including posting quality video internet [ ... ] . everyone i know comments quality video pictures come out amazing . i'm just layman far photography concerned , but i feel like professional when i use my exilim . it sleek easy manipulate ; it very nice size display screen ; buttons prompts very easy follow . if you're thinking buying it , look z1000 first ; but this one should steal mpeg4 technology which like movie footage . happy snappy	1
my wife purchased this camera she adores it . it easy use produces excellent pictures . important feature this camera its viewfinder . many manufactuers , including casio , eliminated viewfinder most compact models such this , forcing us use just display screen . although screen more accurate than optical viewfinder , it virtually useless bright sunlight . we particularly like dial camera , allowing user more easily switch modes without need push menu button scroll through various options . while this not slimmest compact cameras , it still quite small handy	1
puts my powershot a70 higher level photographic ingenuity .	1
this great product , fine gift , espcially those who love photographs but not techie or don't computer . i diappointed auto shut-off feature couldn't disabled , but fix below our friend quot ; customer west des moines , iaquot ; brilliant worked me first time , less than three minutes time invested . company should send him/her dozen these picture frames figuring this out	-1
michael bates ' review error . all true rechargeable batteries 1.2 volts so this charger operating correct specifications . non-rechargeable batteries 1.5 volts	1
it amazing how much they squeeze into such small space . i owned one form elph or , past 7 or 8 years , they've always top quality . this version no exception . everything you'd expect one leading names digital cameras . screen big , menus onscreen information clear everything very intuitive . picture quality fantastic ! crisp hi res , many options size quality . detail some my shots simply astounding ! video capture some best i've seen none dedicated camera . 640x480 @ 60 fps mode , quite startling when you first see it . improved video capabilities one main reasons i upgraded . battery life seems very good . infact , i'd say it bit improvement over my last elph . i purchased extra battery , so i could charging one , while using other . i still haven't switched batteries yet :) overall , very please . this great , stylish , neat , full featured , camera	1
i this over 6 months now i cant really complain it . its compact easy use . however , people glasses would trouble using it . i use it without my glasses(there power caliberation you match ur eye power ) then its very clear . easy carry around solid . very good its price	-1
this camera great because its size its features just what you looking digital camera . it fixes blurring zoom cability takes phenomental pictures . it good investment future memories	-1
this wonderful camera . i nikon coolpix s1 . it also excellant until i dropped it . i replaced it this s7c . view screen bigger , 3 " . camera itaelf slighter bigger than s1 but still very compact easily fits pocket . play back photo feature easier use than original . picture quality superb . s1 , s7c slow take pictures flash mode . this cause you miss some candid shots . camera certainly worth cost .	1
strengths : excellent video audio quality . great still pictures . cool touchscreen lcd . night shot video amazing . built flash very powerful . weaknesses : battery protruded outside kinda gives odd look . user manual supplied not very informative ... u got explore all menus urself . u need docking stn connect pc . summary : hey , no more additional softwares convert all other video formats , directly recorded mpeg format , connect pc rip your dvd .. its easy . picture motion browser supplied handycam cool very handy , you trim out unwanted portion your videos . i waiting this since long . i purchased this just bcos its predecessor sr-100 big hit , this one all features sr-100 some extra features	1
i love this camera . it super easy use takes fantastic pictures . megapixels such you even blow things up still good quality picture . i would highly recommend this camera . i zero problems love canon products	1
i wanted camera whole family could use - including my 10 year old son . this camera proven much more ! what impresses me most astounding battery life quick focus features . it excellent price point well . our pictures no longer suffer dreaded ' redeye ' effects . i upgraded 4 year old olympus4 megapixel camera am blown away improvements over period . canon rocks	1

i love this camera ! i own sony f707 , now discontinued since broke this only other camera market tilt/rotateing screen . this ideal when you children because you don't get down floor you just hold camera waist level tilt screen ! it takes great pictures great video too ! i love it	1
photo quality excellent ! like 10x zoom . ability this camera its large zoom 6mp fit shirt pocket great . my only complaint tiny size multi-selector . it makes selections unnecessarily difficult .	-1
viewer back really big . i like features it . panoramic help particularly nice . main downfall this camera time lapse pushing button picture actually taken . then after picture taken , you wait little while it stored . it takes good quality pictures , but it hard " photoshoot " toddler any pictures look okay because toddler faster than camera . i haven't taken any strictly scenery pictures it yet , but i hunch those turn out great . there vivid color setting pictures i taken outside very nicely colored	-1
i got this camera my birthday year or two ago it awesome ! it handheld , it works great , it never blurry ! this probably one best presents ever given me !	1
i am jewelry designer struggled idea spending hundreds dollars photography set-up photograph my designs , yet i needed photograph them pictures i taking just didn't capture details i needed . friend relative just purchased this item really liked it , it seemed perfect solution my problem , price right so i ordered it . i couldn't happier . set-up easy . unit super-portable , little tweaking here there , picture quality fantastic . only negative it seems tiny bit flimsy i wonder if it stand test time . but even if it lasts just few years , i consider it money well spent . really great item great price	1
i recently hired shoot hundreds small items catalog . rather than take my large light setup , i took studio-in-a-box shoot . little unit left all day 3 sessions three days . photos look fine i saved great deal set-up time . all this unit really needs make it perfect some sort diffuser/reflector front ( help lessen glare glass bottles such ) . included camera stand isn't quite strong enough many dslrs ( including mine ) but most photographers already own decent tripod or two . it paid itself many times over	-1
i love this camera , i love quality still video . great purchase . everything everybody wrote here true . however : * it requires proprietary usb cradle download pictures computer . it doesn't standard usb jack . so get ready pack cradle whenever you going travel . * it uses its own proprietary battery gets charged when camera cradle . if you run out power while outside , you can't just buy couple aas use them until you get back home . * if you carry it your pocket without carrying case , it flip turn itself battery discharged . i thought buyers should know this . these minor annoyances make me sometimes choose take my old , clunky 1.2 mp sony trips instead this one just because it so much more straightforward . anyway , it good camera .	-1
before i get k10d , i experienced olympus e-500 , canon xti , nikon d80 . i used olympus e-500 take lots vivid color pictures i love very much , but no water resistance no second display window , also only 3 focus point makes it not so enjoyable . same thing happen canon xti , no water resistance no second display window make it little hard use when you need change settings . nikon d80 great camera but also no water resistance shake reducer build camera , color tone d80 isn't kind i would love . finally i bought pentax k10d , feeling body , water resistance , shake reducer , auto dust remove , vivid color tone , etc ... makes me feel k10d way go . only complaint would limited edition lens hard get . get it while you	1
i pleasant surprised k10d it combines built-in image stabilization , self-cleaning sensor , easy-to-use image controls sealed body . it just fills right my hands . i'm not going repeat all good pints found previous reviews . but i want comments some " cons " . yang mi point out : " 10m not much bigger than 6m (* ist dl ) , it good but don't expect big difference ... " more pixels isn't give you better image . you wouldn't see difference 5x6 or 8x10 print . but if you want print 24x36 print this when you need more pixels . overall it great camera big step forward istds/k100 series cameras . i like k10 more controls body before bared menus . i like raw button big time . what hold me give k10d five stars it af . even af much improved ds still not fast nikon d70s . highly recommended	-1
it hugs camera perfectly . i love it because it fits my purse . good price leather too	1
good product-compact easy tuck pocket or camera case . useful item clean lens everyone needs this good photos	1
camera itself if fine but please beware . they show product weight 20lbs meaning you charged over $40 ship when box it arrived shows 3 lbs . said , i really like camera , it going take while get through all features but seems far superior standard point clicks i using .	-1
i noticed there aren't any pictures my mom around after her passing . so i decided her pictures displayed , but instead printing framing lot it , i decided get digital display . i got this digital photo viewer lot less than what others charging this didn't disappoint . 16x9 aspect ratio not best since you convert your pictures 480x234 it fit perfectly without stretching . cameras don't take anamorphic shots even widescreen . other than , i left pics high resolution allowed some stretching view 16x9 . brightness crisp you play controls get used . music not play while photos viewed . maybe more expensive brands trick . i figured i always turn music player if i want listen music . 7 " viewable screen , it good enough . i'd recommend this price alone if you looking simple photo viewer doesn't involve lot gadgetry	-1
this battery compatable those camcorders : # dcr-hc20# dcr-hc30# dcr-hc40# dcr-hc65# dcr-hc85	1
night when i noticed this frame superior conventional frame holding paper photos . this bright sharp . frame looks acceptable any living room . my wife it work where 350 pictures slowly work through slideshow . her colleagues love it . simply drag drop , { buy least 500 meg card } , files your computer card , then insert your card side digital frame . you change couple settings it . it simple menu . overall , monkey could figure it out . i bought one my wife office we just bought her mom dad	1
very happy this multi function camera price . five stars value ... it records digital video low file size . asf format easily read winamp media player . i tried pull video into adobe premiere edit no luck but windows movie maker accepts it allows you export it out into many workable formats . video file size amazingly small . 512 mb sd card we took couple hours video . mp3 i card took up more space . camera 16 mb internal memory ... not room much . get big sd card .. they getting really cheap now . quality video ok . its not high def video any means but looks decent my 17 " laptop . there setting 640x480 its looks good my big screen . most videos i get net not good quality size this little guy puts out . you need decent amount light this work well . also slow smooth motions while recording help get better quality . music plays well this device . menu find songs isnt great . you just scroll through songs find names . file names appended hard read . i beleive due screen size . defeintly not meant music player but plays mp3s none less . i took look ipod nano it tiny . but i like this because all you get money . ipods nanos just music players non expandable memory ( 2 4 gb ) . photos ok .. i noticed alot artifacts some photos while others came out smooth . alkaline batteries didnt last too long . i read somewhere it best use batteries rated camera use .. nicad or something . read other reviews more info this . use camera other functions there spin wheel changes function camera video camera music .. etc . so this device fairly easy use . web cam i havent tried but plug it into my computer monitor myself easily ... its decent monitor i'm sure it web cam thing well . overall this device great value . it all its functions fairly well easy figure out . $99.00 usd you hardly go wrong . but if you need high quality any one features look specialty device .	1
i would recommend this lens all d50-d80 users , price you get incredible sharp throughout its focal range , macro function impressive . also , it very well constructed nice balance very light	1
compre la dvc7 hace ya poco mas de un a�o en amazon . la compre porque mi esposa estudio la carrera estaba interesada en tener sus propios negocios en el tema de video digital . voy separar el review en varios temas que me parecen fundamentales : calidad de imagenla camara tiene 1ccd de 1/3 sino me equivoco , lo cual la hace medianamente aceptable entre las camaras de tipo consumer , ojo , no hablo de las semi pro o pro . sin embargo , tiene un calidad de imagen impresioante en ambientes de iluminacion controlada . si vas usarla en ambiente oscuros , encontraras algunas cosas que te sorprenderan si no estas familiarizado con las camaras profesionales . en conclusion , si la vas usar en situaciones de iluminacion razonable , te ira de las mil maravillas ( tengo unas imagenes excelentes filmadas con esta camara)construccionel formato de la camara es grande , tipo camara profesional , lo que la hace relativamente impresionante primera vista . digamos que el 99% de las personas que te vean con esta camara pensaran qeu definitivamente sabes lo que haces ... la camara es basicamente plastica , no pesa mucho , apenas 3 kilos . no pretendas usarla con una glidecam sin el soporte de cuerpo , simplemente sera imposible de cargar . el viewfinder me parece muy pequeno , no es adaptable para usar con el ojo izquierdo . la pantalla lcd mide 2.5 � , no me parecia pequenna hast que compre otra camara , una sony con pantalla de 3.5 se ve inmensa !, pero la de la panasonic se ve muy bien tambien . ubicacion de controlesla camara peude ser utilizada al hombro , tipo camarografo de tv , o con el asa para mano , en ambos sitios , tiene control de grabacion zoom . el zoom del asa es mas suave lento que el zoom en la parte del handgrip . algo que me encanta me resulta super util cuando fimamos eventos largos donde no puede haber edicion , es la posibilidad de hacer fade sin la necesidad de estar grabando ( ideal para cuando usas la camara con salida directa sin usar cassettes ) . por lo demas , los controles son faciles rapidos de comprender yy utilizar . ventajas contra otras camarassi quieres utilizar funciones ed pros sin ser uno de ellos , pero aprender en el camino , esta camara es para ti . tiene control de foco con un ring en la parte delantera , entrada plug de microfono , salida de audifonos , control de volumen de grabacion , ganancia , etc , control de shutter , de ganancia ( basico en situaciones super oscuras ) , control de white balance , etc . problemas ocurridosdespues de unos meses tuve que enviarla soporte tecnico por un problema medio extranno , se colgaba queria grabar , aparentemente era u problema con unas piezas , investigue en internet aparentemente nadie mas le sucedio , por lo que asumo qeu fue mala suerte un problema con estas camaras . otro detalle fue medio anno despues , durante un evento en un hotel , aparentemente no le fue bien con el aire acondicionado , ya que me saco un mensaje de condensacion luego de varias horas de uso , un poco de ventilacion continuo en el trabajo sin problemas . impacto visualdefinitivamente se ve bien , tiene el peso correcto si quieres ahcer tomas suaves , no es muy pesada como para que no la opere una mujer , no es muy liviana para que se mueva con cualqueir pequenna reaccion de tu mano . los clientes siempre les llama la atencion el aspecto de esta camara , lo cuale muy bueno cuando de negocios se trata . manejo en la pcse conecta sin problemas , la utilizo para bajar subir video en formato dv con premiere , studio , etc . en conclusion , si no quieres gastar en una sony de 3ccd o una canon tipo xl2 o similar , quieres tomartelo con calma , esta es una buena opcion , no te va defraudar	-1
case too small looks bigger web , i returned product	-1
this case fits camera like glove ! it looks nice protects it - accessory you should get this camera !	1
works well ! tested it first like directions say watching out stray hairs , dirt , etc . then took it too pool , works perfect .... dont concerned few super tiny bubbles come out first , they hide seal wrist strap . i overly cautious . best $6 uw housing i'll ever find	1
i knew i would need backup battery my olympus e500 . this identical battery supplied camera . i wanted use olympus battery after reading some bad reviews knockoff replacements . battery seems plenty reserve power even though e500 full color display all functions instead 2 displays most dslr ( one usually low power lcd display exposure settings ) . i only long term experience nimh batteries point-n-shoot so i really can't make final review longevity lithium-ion batteries . laptops seem lose holding power over time . so far i'm happy , but if something goes bad , i'll update my revie	-1
great product , even better price !! i'm thrilled quality ease use . i love it ! great birding , recommend very highly !!	1
these glasses should not bushnell name them , which misleads one think they good quality . i bought them my son , time i got around sending them , i discovered plastic housing cracked where front lens screws , so lens misaligned . it past 30-day return date , so i glued crack kept them my own use . they still not right , but i keep them my car occasional use . my advice -- spend some extra money get good pair .	-1
we bushnell finally wore out after twenty years , tech out paced it . i bought pair glasses vendor , these . this superior set . easy adjust , powerful , fact too powerful our backyard feeders , we use compact pair yard , save this beach bird walks . bushnells not super compact , but compact 8 x40 model i bought going ebay this week . good buy , should last twenty years . if you new birder , keep it simple , buy these several birdbooks , fun	1
original piece i lost this replacement , cordless , which i prefer .	-1
kodak color cartridge paper easy share photo printer which i purchased great product great bargain . convenience able make my own prints my kodak easy share photo printer perfect me . i take lots digital prints sometimes i want make prints i immediately share my friends family . even though cost each print may little higher than you would pay drugstore or online printing service , results much better . since i love take pictures i enjoy enhancing them printing them myself , this perfect product me . you enhance your photographs your computer then print them kodak easy share photo printer . quality prints kodak thermal print system absolutely incredible . everyone i share prints remarks how great photos look . all all , kodak ph160 color cartridge photo paper kit great deal me	1
this obviously made work kodak-branded printer docks camera docks , so don't buy this paper package if you don't own one or other . said , i strongly recommend getting this 160 package instead smaller packages because ) it ends up much cheaper when you consider how many more pieces photo paper ink you get , ) even if you don't print lot , you'll use them all up sooner or later . it not like they expire , right ? considering you get free shipping no sales tax if you order it amazon , than several-dollars-cheaper-than-best-buy price sounds even sweeter !	-1

this printer wonderful . it presents great prints quickly through variety connections . its prints high quality quite water proof ( water just beads up , nothing runs ) . i think anyone purchasing it should know few important points . 1 . wi-fi card sticks out printers side preventing you closing slot cover if it installed . 2 . you don't " print " it through bluetooth , you copy pictures printer file transfer utility . ( this mean you send your cell phone pictures directly it if your cell phone bluetooth ) . 3 . setting up any wireless options requires usb connection your computer . 4 . it no on/off switch . i am very happy this printer	1
well i dont think my money got wasted !! cool one shooting great pictures , auto focus good . 2 gb card start shooting memories ... recommended !!	1
camcorder features found only more expensive models resonably easy operate beginner . quality picture very good zoom operated very smoothly . overall i felt it product well thought out design well made	-1
titles says it all . money , best camcorder hands down . after 2 weeks intense research month using this camcorder , no regrets	1
it would this one . hahaha . it love my life . it takes amazing pictures videos . its easy use once you get hang buttons different functions it get kicked around , dropped , wet crushed without problem . only reason i didn't give it 5 stars because sound videos bad sometimes . mainly if you're trying record live music concerts . but pictures concerts amazing	-1
i love this little camera ! after waiting 10 years buy digital camera , i'm very happy this one . 1996 , i working digital imaging lab first point shoot camera's; said time i'd buy one when resolution reached 2000x3000 pixels , they affordable . this camera what i waiting . combination ability shoot asa 1600 , sharp images , good size , price under $200 ( rebuilt ) factors made me choose this camera . slightly clunky menu system small capacity xd card minor problems , but shouldn't stop you buying this camera	1

i many traditional film slrs including original pentax k1000 ( fully manual ) , canon rebel xos canon elph . when considering digital slr cameras canon digital rebel point-and-shoot canon digital elph top my list . but $150 less than canon digital elph , casio exilim ex-s series better buy same features ( some cases better execution same features ) . if you're looking fun point-and-click camera record audio , avi movie files digital pictures this it . it takes 15 miuntes read manual you're off taking pictures . pay attention when reading manual everything else seem very intuitive . all cameras i i use this one most often . other users complained proprietary lithium ion battery but 3rd party equivalents available right here amazon site , you just look . my back-up battery only [ ... ] bucks . san disk 1gb memory cards cheap too , [ ... ] online , [ ... ] retail . last , i agree many users lock switch needs developed so you keep camera accidentally turning when it your pocket -- but remember many cameras this problem/lack/this feature . i solved my own issues buying [ ... ] case belt loop	1
pros : this camera great , 5mp excellent picture quality . cons : can't make zoom when filming video :	1

like most , i've owned many cameras over years - canons , fujis even polaroid . my favorite fuji . digitals , my current stable includes these cameras : - canon a520 ( 4 megapixel ) workhorse - sony dsc-w7 ( 7.2 mp ) - 2.5 " viewfinder new addition : - fujifilm e900 ( 9mp ) - 2 " viewfinder work i , i needed raw format 9-10mp this fuji e900 camera fits bill . originally , i wasn't looking point-and-shoot . hoping get 10mp raw which prices you out compact camera range into more expensive slrs . this fuji fits nicely - not quite bleeding edge 10mp but very good near point-and-shoot size . note : others mentioned , this camera rated high consumer reports . here my ratings : pros = = = = - good ergonomics- fast on/off/store- supports raw ( it really wasn't hard find menus)- aa batteries ( my canon , sony fuji all use aa nimh rechargables)- photoshop pulls raw image right ( it supported camera )[ ... ] cons = = = = - fuji e900 2 " view finder little small ( same my 4mp canon a520 ) but this camera * * few years old . - flimsy camera terms plastic quality . fuji cameras built price though this one good value today prices . sony w7 feels more substantial . sony survived drop 4 feet onto pavement ( same day i bought e900 - go figure)- 16mb xd card included can't even fit * one * raw image throws " card full " immediately after setting format " raw " * before * i even took picture . i waiting 1gb xd accessory card but geez , not even one raw photo out-of-the-box ??? - 1/3 larger than my sony w7 . fuji no longer " fit shirt pocket " compact camera but quality higher mp worth it . other cameras looked : -panasonic dmc-fz50 10.1 mp - one i wanted but too much $$$-fujifilm finepix s9000 9mp - not compact . cheaper than panasonic-fujifilm finepix s9100 9mp - not compact .

this camera truely incredible ! pictures really come out beautiful it really easy use . only function i find not superior rest macro function . close up photos not clarity even cheaper fujifilm cameras . other then i highly recommend this digital	-1
i leaving college this fall wanted little something easy handle send home videos , or post them . it works great ! i am especially excited compiling them onto dvd my laptop dvd burner . it so tiny it fits my pocket it very good batteries , you need buy scan disk ( i suggest 512 mb or 1 gig ) but it still turns out cheaper than regular clunky sized video camera . course it isn't amazing quality but it small enough take anywhere capture every anything . great deal money	1
nice little bag . it fits my jvc everio videocam power adapter my little canon elph its power adapter . no room left videocam remote , manuals misc cables . good little bag . i would liked it weeeee bit bigger so i could fit extra junkbut otherwise very good little bag ( good price )	-1

this product delivers exactly promised we could not more pleased . pictures wonderful . initial downloading process straighforward problem-free . we actually purchased three photo frames ourselves our children they love them much we . slideshow feature wonderful well . everyone our friends seen photo frame equally amazed this product some not aware such product even existed . sure , they expensive but worth cost . we enjoy our photo frame years come we update new pictures regularly . thanks folks philips getting this soooooooooooo right .	1
this fabulous gift grandparents if you preload pictures . just aware customer support folks not knowledgeable , probably since product new . don't bypass their software load pix if you're transferring your pc frame - their software reduces memory needed each one . even though software different size frames labelled same , it not compatible you only one version installed your pc time	1
we got this camcorder our daughter her birthday she loves it ! her only problem it memory card needed because there isn't much space she would like alot light needed film . we aware both these complaints when we purchased it but we certain she could work around them . we also aware battery problem , so she got rechargeable batteries . awesome little camcorder , especially price	-1
works really fine what it meant ! little side pocket put filter spare memory stick would nice , but missing . one i my sony dsc-h1 it ... maybe you should buy new a100 bag instead	-1
this product rugged forgiving . accurate +/- 1 ft ., this absolute must all serious bowhunters . lightweight easy use , i find only one minor design flaw . it designed right-handed use slightly cumbersome those who choose use it left-handed hunters ( i am ) . even this minor design flaw , i still am very satisfied this unit would not hesitate recommend it others . most encounters under 50 yards ease use accuracy critical elements hunt . i harvested nice elk this year 52 yards using this unit . thanks bushnell	-1
bought this flash my evolt 500 . great flash most types typical low light situations fill-flash . it offers all advanced features creative lighting such bounce , diffused light angled bounces . allows manual settings works incredibly well auto settings camera . olympus makes several accessories this flash help you get this off camera multiple flash or slave set-ups . more power throw distance , complete professional capabilities , go more expensive fl-50	1
i recently purchased this item my evolt 500 all i say wow . i went camera store held both fl 36 fl 50 decided go fl 36 . fl 36 alot smaller which i liked . i'm gonna mainly use it vacation pictures , birthdays holidays . so i really don't need fl 50 . my opinion , if you're not gonna shooting weddings , you really don't need fl 50 . i've noticed 500 always problems focusing low light . camera would search , fire af illuminator off like crazy , it still wouldn't focus . even just focusing regular indoor lighting problem . this completely solves this problem . i able focus my girlfriend complete darkness .. accurately quickly . i already thinking getting different camera year or so just because low light focusing issue . but now .. i'll probably use this camera good five years , if not more . even if you weren't looking external flash ... buy it . just improvement low light focusing alone worth money . recycle great , i threw cheap dollar store batteries just so i use it first day i brought it recycle time fast enough . i'm not really trying shoot night pics indy 500 . stop searching buy this item . i also recommend sto_fen om-600 omni-bounce diffuser . its made nikon sb600 but if fits perfect my fl-36 . nice snug . it makes big difference . trust me , you'll thank me comments later !!!!!!	1

firstly , i love its black all-metal body . i also love its ergonomics size . i've own other digital p/s slrs . they all good cameras , but big size . i tend bring l60 me everywhere i go ( e.g. biking , hiking , etc . ) convenience . inside , it also beautiful . i've ordered prints upto 11x14 they turned out beautiful . using 2gb sd card , it also allowed me record more than 1.5 hours 640x480 video mpeg4 30 fps . if you need small , robust camera you take everywhere you go still takes beautiful pictures , this it	1
bought this camera my teenage daughter who wanted something sleek . camera all powerful too . photo quality excellent camera easy operate . video feature works very well , also . my daughter found controls intuitive enough she hardly look user manual . battery life good although you can't charge it without removing battery . extracting inserting battery pretty straightforward not inconveinient you might think . this easy pick solid , versatile camera	1
this camera fun use easy too . it great size keep my coat pocket all times . also 1 gb memory card i take many many pictures battery lasted few weeks before needing recharge . overall this good buy value .	-1
daughter great time using it . size makes it easy take it anywhere	-1

this camera very small , sleek light . it takes great pictures lot features . only 3x zoom but zoom much farther once picture taken . i used olympus past never problem their products . :	-1
this camera very nice . i actually bought it my g/f she loves it . when it first arrrived i got mess w/ it bit before giving it up her . i really enjoyed different settings take picutres . its great cause usually you get those shots way too bright because flash or too dark because no flash . this camera takes care both problems easy . i even enjoyed software it came w/ . only problem i when you upload pictures computer sure you push " safely remove hardware " button or you end up getting camera say there more pictures camera than there . this easy solve though . theres way you clear camera memory but im not sure i remember how . so problem more user error than product problems . great camera great price . it might not same prices since i got it electronics expo so it knocked down price but it worth original price . so theres my review . not depth but point . good enough	1
similar tripod i owned great if it paint hadn't begun chipping after 1.5 year gentle use ; since i've only this tripod 2 months , i hope sony paint more durable ! otherwise , this one shortest compact tripods becomes one longest when its legs fully extended . this makes better camera height angle versatility especially when used or near ground level . it also sturdy enough hold any typical ( not just sony ) point shoot digital camera ( i not used it camcorder ) stable even if mounted sideways vertical pictures . furthermore , this only tripod i found comes pouch ; it wonderful avoiding scratches other damage if you tend store your camera its accessories one bag .	1
this small tripod proved quite useful . first , because its size , it absolutely portable , fitting into side pocket camera bag . it allowed me setup stable shots even when visiting places where carrying full-size tripod not possible or least not convenient . i also use my digital video camera shoot still photography small electronic components . this mini-tripod wonderful these shots , it allows camera still very close up subject yet still mounted stable surface . , trust me , when shooting such small subject , any hand jitters show up every time . i definitely recommend this anyone using digital cameras , whether video or still photography . it very handy piece aluminum you	1
this camera so cool ! it small enough carry around my purse . it very intuitive learn use . kodak website contains loads information user friendly . most all pictures beautiful	1
before i bought this camera , i worried some reviews . i guess you can't please everyone . long you recharge camera , or carry spare li-ion battery , you fine . zoom great , but really outstanding feature this camera wide angle lens . you won't just using it those indoor family shots -- it great outdoors too , taking additional scenery without distortion . panorama feature easy use , too . i took 245 pictures 7 days love this camera	1
i love this camera case ! it manufactured very fine materials . it very soft touch while protective my camera . craftsmanship outstanding . it well worth purchase price then some	1
first , i'm giving this 70-300mm lens 5 stars rating partly because price quite attractive especially used ones ( version lens even more cheaper picture quality isn't too much different this ed glass version my opinion ) . if your primary objective take pictures low light situation such wedding concert , then get 80-200mm f/ 2.8 or 70-200mm vr f/ 2.8 instead . get this lens ( or it cheaper brother 70-300mm ) any means unless you already those alternative more expensive zoom lenses i mentioned above . pros : 1 . inexpensive ( vr version released , many sell this one)2 . you get up close personal ( 300mm which equivalent 450mm if you attach it dslr ) 3 . very sharp fast bright light situation ( outdoor etc ) , though it gets bit softer you get closer 300mm 4 . very light 5 . bokeh suprisingly good 6 . great portrait 7 . ed glass better contrast picture quality8 . metal mountcons : 1 . though more solid build than 70-300mm version , external part this lens still made plastic . ( but i don't think you should care this ) 2 . very bad low light situation especially if object moving/sports photography , but still works fine long exposure tripod like photographing fireworks or night light building/city/car lights . 3 . focus seems slower low light situation ( focus hunting bit more ) bottom line : this lens loves lot light . if you give this lens lot light , it take good care you . last but not least , after you get this lens , go buy nikon 50mm f/ 1.8 af-d prime lens $100 or less ( equivalent 75mm if used dslr which very good portrait semi-zoom ) . this very fast lens works extremly well low light situation even without using flash . this lens complement your 70-300mm ed lens very very well . also check out 70-300mm ( half price ed ) 70-300mm vr ( released oct 2006 ) . vr feature works really well static object . if obect moving then you better off fast lens like 50mm f/ 1.8 af-d , 80-200mm f/ 2.8 af or 70-200mm vr f/ 2.8 af-shappy photographing !	1
i'm interested lens , heard it great , price good . however i can't find description whether it grey market lens , which may or may not covered nikon warranty i believe one year warranty , or usa warranty , which i believe three year warranty . either way , description needs clarify this . other large internet vendors ( reputable ) offer either types lens charge 10 or 15 percent more usa warranty	-1
i used them last night see sky 20:00 . i saw very clear orion its nebula , pleiades star cluster , saturn , venus . not very good use holding them hand . so make sure use heavy tripod . next step : reflector telescope .	1
i ordered these two weeks ago just started using them view moon ( yowzer -- they bring light ! ) view raptors , ducks , other birds half mile across section susquehanna river below conowingo dam . i floored how well these . i not only see incredible detail birds middle river small islands , but birds completely other side sitting trees . my husband able identify blue jay sitting shrubs opposite bank . they not heavy use without tripod . i arthritis both hands could use them easily , propping my elbows occasionally nearby fence , but just steady myself brisk wind , not because they too heavy . i am very happy i not go my first instinct get spotting scope tripod . i walking spot spot easily , picking out different winter visitors , while fellow viewing birds keep folding up his spotting scope tripod , moving , unfolding tripod , resetting scope -- too annoying ! this works very well half-mile distance i am using it , closer distances delight ! very pleased this buy	1
although , i haven't gotten white screen ... yet , i problem opening battery latch . maybe spring broke or something , anyway , i called sony them fix it . they going charge me over $100 fix it ... finally today , i got butter knife pryed it open . finally after 4 months cameraless , it opened ! i going pay them fix it . battery life minimum , but other than ish , great camera :] lasted me japan , got great pictures	-1
this charger works great . compact design flip down plug , indicator light shows it charging when its complete . very happy this product	1
there really not much else say . perhaps i review hex nut next . ; -	1
according photo magazine , this cosmetically re-labelled konica minolta 75-300 ( ) zoom telephoto , which lens i own ( it certainly looks exactly same km 75-300 lens , but ' sony ' name ) . which case , i following review : ( 1 ) excellent construction quality , this very nicely made lens , excellent finish , not too heavy but solid without ' plastic ' feel many medium-priced lenses ; ( 2 ) excellent optical quality , good sharpness even longest 300mm focal length where most zooms begin show poor quality ; ( 3 ) very unusual : near-zero distortion throughout entire range focal lengths ( very different some sigma zooms i own , which conspicuously visible pincushion distortion ) . this may well lowest-distortion 75-300 telephoto any maker . ( 4 ) one caveat : autofocus low light : my minolta maxxum 7 film camera , whose autofocus system apparently quite similar sony alpha 100 , camera difficulty autofocussing 75-300 lens 300 mm setting ( where aperture only f/ 5.6 ) light weaker than direct sunlight . this probably same any f/ 5.6 or slower lens . i found myself switching manual focus 300 mm setting if subject not brightly lit . note : konica minolta 75-300 ( ) lens still available , $140 , reportedly work sony alpha 100 just well similar lens labelled sony	-1
extremely impressed tz3 . this gem should get 5 stars construction finish alone . just holding it your hands it screams quality feels like tank . love it . it seriously feels like $700 camera . no exaggeration . i little worried it not able fit my jean pockets before buying it . women may issues really tight jeans but us guys no problem . it fits fine . i seriously cant believe i carry around camera 10x zoom inside my jean pockets . truly remarkable . 3 " screen amazing . you practically enjoy your pics right screen w/o even printing them high res output . navigation so easy this camera . something not surprising though if your already coming panny ( fz7 here ) . picture quality great . i tested it out today standard i would say its just good my fz7 daylight better lowlight ( indoors ) . image quality great , if you need extra sharpness you could always use camera " vivid mode " or add little some post processing . pics standard natural mode pp very well . wide angle something new me . took some neat shots looked very nice extra viewing angle . very distinctive after this i'm not sure if i could go back . if your looking it all camera this may very well your tool choice . combine it extreme versatility coupled excellent image quality , superb lens , build , finish you yourself winner .	1
i came off canon powershot s40 , little 4-megapixel brick camera gave me 4 years excellent results . my first digital camera after closet-full film nikons . many buffs claim 4 megapixels all you need , i made number nice looking a3 prints . now i 7 megapixels work , i see i wrong : four not enough . seven wonderful.dpreview.com points out strongly above iso 200 noise real problem -- but you always wonder just how picky they . well not too picky this case . using higher than 200 setting ( i.e. , most indoor flash shots ) resulted lot noise , making camera almost unusable except simplest 4 6 snapshots . but i take almost entirely outdoor shots -- scenics candids . i set iso 100 get gorgeous results . it taken some getting used different color rendition tz3 my canon . canon seems more balanced while tz3 caused reddish orange really pop out . there something cool ( color temperature-wise , not " fashionable " ) color not entirely fixed photoshop . sometimes result marvelous , especially shots cloudy or rainy days . other times they not so great . so i playing around various settings --" natural " " vivid . " " vivid " closer what i want right out camera , but less easy spruce up . " natural " easier modify , so setting i am using now . i pleasantly surprised how small tz3 : it slips easily into pants pocket ( but not shirt pocket ) . zoom lens stating decent wide-angle ( 28mm ) utterly fantastic really makes camera stand out head shoulders pack . thus , i am delighted choice . however , answer my question " what more could i want ? " , here it : 1 . selection disk always moves when i pocket camera , so i always check , when i pull it out , rest desired setting . its detents need strengthened . 2 . back side controls too easy activate accidentally when shooting one-handed fleshy part thumb . headache because you then need press " select " get back operation . 3 . dpreview right when they moan venus iii sensor . it good but , otherwise sensational camera like this one , not good enough	-1
not best ui ( easy figure out , but not intuitive slightest ) , but picture looks great ( comparitively ) low resolution . scaling algorithm good job taking high-res pictures making them look pretty sharp low-res screen . super bright display ! i impressed . never ran it batteries so i can't speak battery life , but ac adapter , it run all day	-1
this best accessory i every bought any electronic device . it worked perfectly , already small size camera , it still pretty small able go swimsuit pocket . even my wife loved it . we went snorkeling , swimming , water slides it took great pictures video . well worth money !!	1
i bought this my carribean cruise , it fits like glove . i wanted buy one canon sd500 after i saw one cabo baja unlimited	1
we early digital camera adopters so this model now our 5th or 6th camera . requirement us when we buy digital camera availabilty underwater housing since we use these camera during scuba trips . we larger sony dsc-f707 amphibico housing which great job us but requires crate when we take it diving . this camera purchased sony brand underwater housing which tiny neatly organized so entire package very compact travel . sony made some significant improvements their underwater housings since first generation including double o-rings ability support deepest recreational dives . camera housing fit tiny backpack easily goes under airplane seat . serious underwater photography you require heaps external light i'm not fan sony underwater lighting solution but other choices exist . my favorite things camera large 2.5 " screen which allows me easily see which shots i want keep . small , thin light size also makes it easy use . big selling feature me 640x480 30 fps mpeg movie capability so we email clips people actually see . docking station makes sure it always charged ready . i've very pleased battery life . far " cons " go there few . i would like see better flash ( which seems case most digital cameras ) more than 3x optical zoom . again , larger zoom seems improbable camera this size . land , unit bit inconvenient use tripod since it must docking station mount . i consider all these minor since my primary goal small underwater-capable camera would 640x480 mpegs bright 5.1 mp shots . me , sony met those goals small form factor attractive price .	1
this camera my second digital camera . it very nice far price picture goes . pictures come out very clear but you would need get sd card because internal memory not hold more than 10 pictures . functions simple ready use . there single-button video function takes long videos audio . you also add audio still photos . downside this camera it uses lot battery . not use store-bought regular alkaline batteries it drain within 25-30 shots w/ flash . please use least 2200 mah rechargeable battery . when using rechargeable batteries , you find you get least 150 200 shots , no problem . still , camera battery drainer . also , camera only tells you low battery when it low battery . there no battery scale lcd screen so you not know when you would need new batteries . lcd enough regular use view pictures but i find it somewhat fuzzy quality compared transferring photos viewing computer . flash recycle time longer than others may not able take multiple shots within 10 seconds .	-1
i m417 nearly year now nothing but best say . first digital camera i ever found it so easy take photos , transfer photos , print them . i found friends families cameras too complex bothered , but m417 simple operate quality excellent . if you can't bothered take photography course still want great photos , buy m417	-1
i just love this camera ! quality photos videos excellent . battery life never problem all . it very easy store it dock . videos great so convenient i find myself taking more videos this camera than my video camera .	1
there reviewer who stated this camera made " annoying jingle " everytime you turned it told sony technical support it unable turned off . don't let sway your opinion this buying this amazing camera because after playing around it 5 minutes , i figured out how turn it off	1
this camera fulfiled my expectations well seller who shipped it right away .	1
i bought this camera general use like it lot . compared other cameras ive owned this one very good sound recording capability . it ergonomics good its pleasant use most part . using dvd options camera could little more refined but i imagine mature future generations . i'd recommend it anyone looking dvd camcorder use family or low end presentations . bad : editing software included it rubbish requires shelling out more money right off bat if you actually want create anything reasonably professional any footage . my opinion its technical support headache waiting happen . i checked it out then threw it trash . it also not firewire which highly irritating odd considering my older canons/sonys all firewire connectivity . mac users : this means it not work imovie or final cut pro / express . since my preference using os based editing suites i finish out dvd then put it computer directly . rip footage off dvd then import it into either fcp or imovie . if only it firewire ... short : great camera , very good sound , easy use pleasant operate . clunky , out-of-box-upgrade-requiring , low-end editing software lack firewire keep it perfect little camera it should	-1
i've my web research it pointed me buy canon dc40 among other dvd-camcorders market . it such amazing experience using it capture moments during my nephew birthday party . still shots absolutely fantastic ! video like no other ... it very clear sharp . you may want tweak settings get film look versus homevideo look your video shots . also , tweak stills settings well get slr-like shots . i love this product i highly recommend this all you who planning purchasing dvd-camcorder . cheers ! -- joel pelay	1

just clarify few other differences gs500 gs300 besides those mentioned review below . gs500 indeed offer additional mp still shots ( 4.0 mp ) 12x zoom , but that not all ... it also bigger longer lens , 1/ 4.7 " ccd ( 1070k 3 pixels ) sensors instead 1/6 " ccd ( 800k 3 pixels ) gs300 . filter diameter 43mm instead 37mm . gs500 aperture range 1.6 f16 opposed gs300 1.8 f16 . this all may not make huge difference , but optics technically bit better gs500 , low light ability rated more sensitive too -- minimum 5 lux vs . 12 lux gs300 . gs500 also offers manual focus ring lens ( gs300 " manual , " but it operated through lcd menu/joystick ) , actual hot ( opposed cold gs300 ) shoe mounted accessories such lights or microphones . gs500 procinema shooting mode , designed give widescreen footage " film " appearance . gs300 doesn't . gs500 not automatic lens cap gs300 -- toss up auto bit more convenient , but more noisey . gs500 also real door memory card instead rubber cover over port gs300 . panasonic lists weights gs500 3.17 lbs vs . 2.98 gs300 -- hardly big difference . finally , there also " freestyle " remote addition regular remote gs500 -- this plug remote useful when camera tripod , doesn't come gs300 . course both models no longer available retailers , but these days price difference used models more like $250-300 , so consider well ... despite all i've said , i ended up getting gs300 myself . unfortunately , panasonic 3ccd dv camcorders decline since gs400/250 , currently there no successor gs500 only gs320 currently left panasonic 3ccd/mini dv category . gs320 loses few key features gs300 ( like external mic ) , doesn't touch gs500 . perhaps panasonic get clue introduce good hd mini dv camera one day ..	-1

when i first got my camera , i tried save money getting generic ' equivalent ' battery . big mistake . after fully charging it , camera would take few pictures before showing low battery . i kept shooting anyway , just see what would happen . it didn't turn off , but i noticed side camera became much hotter than when shooting canon brand battery . i tossed generics bought real one , no trouble since . don't try cheap ; go directly name brand .	1
i've bought three different nb-3l aftermarket batteries my canon sd500 none them actually function properly ... they indicate fully charged but when put into camera they immediately show " discharged-replace battery pack " . i even bought aftermarket charger thinking might problem ... same result . i've given up 3rd-party batteries , i'll get this canon brand unit lick my wounds . ( yes , canon overpriced but since they seem engineered camera only work their own batteries i'm kind stuck ... anyone else this problem ?	-1

best quality light tent market . it extremely hard me retire my home made light box but i decided give photo light tents try . i remembered few years back , home made light tents made abs pipe nylon pretty common among product photographers . rave reviews products such plastic domes , housings nothing but pile super expensive junk . not mention setting it up pain butt some how cleaver marketing pushed out bunch these junks . this not case xpro photography light tent . not only it performs better than my home made tent , it easily folded stored small carrying pouch comes tent . sweeten up deal , 2 backdrops included package . i recommend xpro light tents people who trading selling jewelry , glassware , or highly reflective products online . it also recommended photographers specialize product catalog photography . xpro light tent easy use even amateurs start taking product photos like pros	1

my original sd500 psc 50 leather case both stolen during burglary . since they gifts my girlfriend i tried replace exact items . after buying leather case , however , i suspect canon made versions better quality leather . my original case seemed made much higher grade leather . it more smooth elegant than one i just purchased . even small metal ' canon powershot ' emblem front made different kind metal ( not brushed steel like original ) . said , case fantastic . i personally would not care extra pocket/space battery or memory card , instead am driven what most compact stylish .

i canon s40 several years it always worked flawlessly yielding great pictures . however , i want upgrade it more modern camera . unfortunately , s80 discontinued apparently without any replacemnet e.g. s90 works . i then purchased used s80 . it great camera markedly improved over my old s80 . large lcd screen , wider zoom range , smaller size , improved movie mode major changes . i always keep it case when not use , like prior reviewer would pleasantly surprised if it not damaged dropping	1
why this going $899 ???? it listed $400 walmart online .	1
i realy enjoy this camera . what most impresses me charge time very fast . it good quality camera price . i don't care lower reviews , like anything there few lemons out there , but don't let discourage you . i realy recommend this one	-1
course like any person who spends 300 bucks something you expect it perform admirably , while knowing full well there more expensive models out there . this little dv camera quite job . starting packing all way down technical features . world you get less less jvc seems pretty well . instructions camera come 3 languages , all peripherals ; lens cap , multi-voltage power plug , rca cables , straps actually well designed usable . camera itself quite user friendly , intuitive . after opening sorting contents i camera up recording less than 5 minutes . pros : 1 . very fast rewind fast forward . 2 . light weight , compact . 3 . clear display you turn flip almost every direction4 . great zoom features very good recording quality . cons : 1 . no dv tape included . i smart enough pick up two pack same time . 2 . if you big hands it may little hard manipulate . 3 . although i didn't buy tripod , it looks if you can't eject tape while camera attached . would i buy it again ? absolutely	-1
this item terrific its intended purpose - small reminders good memories you carry you . other reviews indicated , though , not expect awesome picture quality . sentimental value not diminished , though	-1
first thing everyone comments seeing this scope then learning what i paid it : " wow- that lot scope bucks ! " . indeed , it got all attachments well rounded amateur scope not only star gazing , but also terrestrial viewing . included accessories all 1.25 " diameter , : ( 1 ) star diagonal ( 90 degree angle adaptor ) . ( 2 ) 20mm eyepiece . ( 3 ) 4mm eyepiece . ( 4 ) 3x barlow lens . ( 5 ) 1.5 erecting eyepiece terrestrial viewing . ( 6 ) 5x24 finderscope . ( 7 ) accessory tray various lens . easily removing accessory tray allow full collapsing tripod legs , then tilting scope full vertical position , whole assembly made ready easy transport or storage . celestron carries full line accessories different eyepieces filters , etc . this real bargain !	1
bag pretty good , but it bit tight digital camera i bought . not flaw case , but not best ultra zoom type digital cameras	-1
i bought this bag sony dcr trv19 mini dv camcorder . it enough room cables , power supply , external mic three tapes . not huge but sufficient if you want keep size minimum . i owned targus laptop computer bags found them high quality durability . so far this bag living up its legacy . i bought it sale 9.99 . i would still pay 12 bucks it	1
love battery life this battery . it also much less expensive than getting cannon replacement	1

i am amateur photographer this tool comes very handy when shooting my dsc r1 tri pod .... totally removes possibility " camera shake "	-1
i use it three sony cameras i own no problems all . sony dsc-r !, hdr-hc1 , f828 . allows better photos low light settings , no more shaky fingers shutter button me	1
like this little thing . i especially impressed half-pressed shutter button , just like actual camera . half-pressing gives camera time focus , full press takes shot . seems very sturdy , zoom telephoto nice touch . i personally like clip , but i guess it would nice if it removable . only reason i give this 4 , it petty , i thought it would cool include jog-dial dscf717 use manual setting , or change focus area .	-1
i ordered accessory kit my sony dsp 200 . after carrying camera around its own while , kit pleasure use . camera fits snugly there room accessories . all feels safe secure . handy days shooting , but there no room cables/cradles , etc , things you keep suitcase . if you're going get spare battery anyway , price pretty good too	1
not all permafocus binoculars this good , but these fantastic . if you tire easily adjusting focus , you won't believe your eyes when you look through these . i used these lake , baseball games golf course . my son dropped pair concrete misaligned one lens . luckily i already purchased pair just return car get them . i am writing this review because i am looking buy yet pair . buy enjoy ! you'll glad you ! besides , this price , what you got lose ?	1
i've using sony handycam work so far it working out pretty well . i'm not manual reader like things work right out box . working knowledge these new gadgets today , it relatively easy get it started . i'm able export directly my computer or create dvd only one touch button ( although i haven't this yet ) . i like it , it easy use , light weight 30 gb hard drive so it never runs out space . only drawback i'm often trying figure out where connectors camera . i'm figuring it out though	-1
i got this bag panasonic dmc-lz5k . camera not arrived yet , but case came within 3 days ( using cheapest shipping ) . it high quality weather proof . front pouch batteries such not big i expected , but probably carry 2 aas sd	1
this small sized binocular excellent those who look portable binocular huge capability strong materials .	1
light , easy use amazing . zoom unbelievable . great product great price . would recommend anyone	1
i bought couple binoculars past . always thinking higher magnification better . that not always true keeping object steady 10 higher your hands tough . higher mags also suck up light making image darker . now i eagleview zoom don't worry which model i should chosen . most part it stays 8 but when i really need get close zoom great . turn slide eyecups fine feature . love ' em	1
love this !! my new cannon sd600 fits perfectly this case . i'm sure it save screen camera scratches and/or trauma !! i ordered red .... find it easily my handbag . quality great seems sturdy	1
i purchased camera case gift ( camera ) my wife , first case seemed too small her canon powershot sd 630 , flap would not secure , but leather soon stretched now it works fine . overall construction seems good solid it really got thorough workout recent vacation . now everything works really well . overall , leather case good product , but some minor pitfalls . since fit so tight you really careful not get sand , or any other debris , case it scratch screen we ours . scratches prevented screen protector , but we couldn't find one before vacation started . other shortcoming strap . it real hassle re-feed strap through hole case every time we finished camera strap also not long enough leave case camera connected . we ended up using original canon strap not red leather strap because it fit under flap better . most importantly , case fashionable makes child-bride very happy , indeed	-1
i research daylights out everything . so i wind up usually buying menage names since i don't believe any manufacturer good everything . since my college days mid-80s , i've hated sony products . i've always believed they waded into far too many product lines their quality suffered . so , up until this purchase i've owned nothing sony 20 years . based reviews , though , i just purchased this camcorder broke it during trip berlin . you cannot beat price quality . superb zoom ( optical really counts digital blurs picture artificial ) , easy menu , great night shot capability . all all , wonderful purchase . not hesitate buy this sony . tip : get pack dvd+rws play since you re-record get pack dual layer rs once you're comfortable because they much more recording space but you cannot re-record them	1
i am military i purchased this product online it sent my wife so she record my family activities cause i am currently iraq she said camera awesome it nice able view my family dvd if my wife work it without me there therefor it very easy use . it perfect camera military family especially since you away home .	1
i bought this tripod after mistakenly purchased 480rm which much shorter . 580rm sturdier carrying case much better quality . controls handle handy camcorder while they prove useless ( mainly zoom button ) dsc-f828 since it manual zoom/focus ring . only problem we ( it seems more camera ) dsc-f828 causes entire tripod head tilt one side due design camera ( lens barrel not centered ) . you would've thought tripod would able handle off-center weights specially sony products . end day , it excellent companion our camera camcorder . would've given 5-stars if not ' tilt ' problem	-1
i always wanted camera could take great pics record . this camera it all . i recommend this camera anyone who wants camera it all . pics come out great video . this camera great !!	1

i purchased this case my new dsc-t10 it looks great , quality leather fits 2 inch belt very snug , which equates very good carrying case . you cannot even tell it your belt magnetic kepper strap works well . there room stuff extra memory stick if you need , but no room additional battery . i guess u gotta give up something sleek styling =) i haven't needed my second stick yet , since i purchased 1 gb 512 mb , if i , i just put it my pants pocket	-1
this battery comes standard panasonic pv-gs35 camcorder . it provides few hours service each charge , even lcd use " stop go " recording playback . it superior most other standard camcorder batteries . naturally , many electronic devices , you want backup battery so you keep recording - there no need spend $75 or more different backup or more powerful one . this one great backup , or primary , battery under $60	1
i bought this frame my wife . she alot digital pictures no good way see them all . after reading reviews others , i decided try this one . she loves it . little card reader we our computer , she drag drop her photos sd card . then just plug card , hook up ac power , turn frame . it goes slide show automatically . we didn't bother re-size or crop photos . 1/2 " black bars each side photo just aren't bothersome us . no remote controls or sound features but if you're looking simple frame just show off all your digital photos , reasonable price , this one great	1
purchased gift well received . seems handle larger chips timely manner . runs everyday , all day no problems encountered . displays vacation pictures clearly . like it big enough view across room . frame more compatible decore than 7 " model previously purchased	1

( 5 seconds or longer . ) frame beautiful . online pictures not it justice . it also feels nice sturdy . i not tried out sound yet i too excited take time . i am hoping they good rest product . if you market digital picture frame not wish spend $200 up , this frame you ! my opinion it very good item money	-1
this product exactly whats advertised . i've found good quality affordable price would definately recommend these anyone looking same	1
i bought two sets these so i would backup set put into my canon s3 when first set ran dry . last year , trip portugal , spain , london , i quite pleased how long these batteries lasted before install replacement set . i able take majority 500+ photographs using just one set , fully charged	1
now i've used camera few months i'd like update my review ( scroll down see original ) . problem i mentioned using camera bright sunlight easily fixed increasing screen brightness . battery life great , far better than my last camera rechargeable aas . camera super easy use gives great pictures . example , i frequently change modes depending lighting feature easily accessed button top camera , not through series menus . friends impressed you zoom video mode , something there cameras cannot , built help screens . used panorama feature recent trip vancouver simple use gave great results . i highly recommend this camera its size , features , ease use . original : i'm really enjoy my new r817 . it easy use buttons all right places . menus use easy follow . friends i've showed it all liked feel ease use without no dials . i bought it size zoom i'm not disappointed . like all cameras without view finder , it hard see screen when shooting into direct sunlight , my only negative . also bought quick charger extra battery case like case . looked new nikon l1 , but one bestbuy broken so i no idea how it works . i figured this not good sign	1
it lasts same original battery panasonic . excellent option price/quality . seller fulfilled treaty	1
i bought this battery backup my panasonic lumix fz3 ; specifically shoot 90min plus soccer games . overall this great battery i am happy my purchase . i've owned it almost year now no complaints . battery performs up standards panasonic battery came my camera . it lasts long panasonic battery , charges up fine ; overall good battery especially money	1
i this lens half-a-year now . pricy , course , but it worth it . it allowed me take some pretty interesting pictures which would not taken any other way . most time it necessary when you `shoot ' animals , e.g. birds , or butterflies , who would not allow you get close . example shoot alligator , where he probably would not mind , but i . then , some architectural shots big distance also become possible . vr ( vibration reduction ) totally amazing . thing , however , eats batteries lunch , so i've started carry second battery . lens comes nice cylindrically shaped bag , because it pretty big heavy , i carry it it original bag , instead trying stick it into same bag camera , so load spread . course , you really need love this type shooting carry it around . overall , lens miracle modern technology , quality exceptional . this great fun , if money allow - i highly recommend .	1
i bought this my 8 year old she loves it . its easy use . she her friends take pictures it all time . she even dropped it few times it still works no problem . pictures movies aren't great but good enough . i wouldn't get it my main camera though . its really more toy	-1

i bought this camera start my production business it best move i could made . this camera great beginner like me . it user friendly while still allowing ajustments . hd also amazing , my customers there videos hd absolutely floored we they get their finished product . few things i recommend getting tripod well extended battery . stock battery only provides 45 min lcd if you add anything other then shotgun mic it lowers it even more . make sure you use only high quality tapes . ( i found out hard way ) good tapes this camera going cost $10 $15 but they worth it when you reduce time re-tape due drop-out film . all together this me great camera price . anything better going run you $8000 or more	1
problem trying extend emitter " blink back " led . due my errors polarity i problems . tried resolve e-mail . marcus sent me unit i still could not get it work ! then i called direct phone number marcus gave me ... problem solved !! if only 10% suppliers responsive this company , world would much better place . also , hot link pro works advertised my case life saver !	1

i'm beginner who still wanted longer reach this lens offered . difference this 70-200mm lens amazing , especially when effective zoom equivalent more than 300mm -- more like 450mm , i'm told . only complaint length time it took amazon get this product me . it arrived my house while i vacation , getting 70-200mm lens cursing my bad fortune	-1
i just recently got nikon d40 christmas , i wanted get nice zoom lens would suit my needs , well really inexpensive , i think this lens fits " " . contrary popular belief , this af-g lens work new nikon d40 , only thing it not autofocus . which isnt big deal really . i rated this lens 5 because it takes amazing pictures . i love it . you really cant beat this lens price .	1
i love this camera . what it -- it works great ! it ultra-compact fits anywhere -- coat or pants pocket -- pistol-grip style make it handy shoot stuff without missing action . this makes it super-convenient traveling -- where you don't end up spending so much time looking through eyepiece you miss enjoying view yourself . mp3 player comes handy long plane flights . no , it not hd camera it shoots poorly under low light conditions . price -- i pleased happy shots it took . i'd love see higher quality version this , too . but it not garbage like some other reviewers stated . it some nice features ( price !! ) some limitations . so if it fits your uses -- get one . you'll glad you . best things this camera/camcorder : -it works great daylight/outdoor conditions-it super compact-it let you point shoot pistol-grip style ( so you enjoy what you're viewing)-it ideal video that going straight web ( it uses avi , mov , asf)-you replace aaa batteries whenever you want/need -- not proprietary battery requires special charger , handy when you travel countries outside us-you replace memory cards when they fill up ( i think cheapest place get them amazon)-it doesn't attract attention itself like large camcorders flashing led recording lights-it nice mp3 player , camera , camcorder , audio recorder all-in-one -- truly multimedia recording devicebut , also beware there some things it doesn't really well ... -it really only works daylight/bright light conditions ( don't even try shooting outdoors night)-the flash doesn't really work unless you're shooting within 3 ' subjec t-t he battery lens cover plastic wear out if heavily used/misused-there no external mic jack-the menu mp3 player limited-the manual somewhat lacking print really small	-1
i own this 3ccd one 1 year . i 2 , 1 jvc 1 panasonic . they not working indoor most time because dark bad light . however , this 3ccd one makes real difference . i am more than happy it . only problem poor still image quality although it says 2mb resolution . but i always use dedicated digial camera , so not big deal me	1
am very pleased this purchase . very fast service shipping . shop amazon again . found this camera easy setup operate . takes great stills movies . thank yo	1
yes , this great camera , many these depth reviews show , however bundled software incompatible windows xp service pack 2 , which makes editing impossible operating sytem not recognize hardware because sony drivers haven't passed logos tests . after spending hours phone troubleshooting it turns out sony drivers not service pack 2 approved they've nothing release updated compatible downloads their website which would solve problem . so i lodged complaint am considering getting rid handycam it not very handy when you can't edit anything . basically it great camera but software plagued compatibility issues not user friendly . i am really upset i spent this much camcorder claims compatible my system it turns out it not , it would seem it would not very hard sony release updated driver would fix this problem . shame you sony .	-1
others said it : this all around very good camera . it got decently sized sensor ( 4.1 mp ) , 3x optical zoom not big wow , but most film point-and-shoots come no zoom all . lcd viewfinder decently sized , though more expensive ones , course , bigger . video mode great it good thing av cable quick share . if you average sub-average picture-taker , like me , you most probably not tripod around , so alone guarantee you blurry shots sub optimal lighting conditions , unless you use flash . so most enhanced scene modes , including nightime modes also manual control mode most probably get blurry results . good thing camera tell you when your shot would prone " shake " blur . way you decide either not take shot , adjust lighting conditions or get ( if you one ) tripod . it sturdy camera . it over year old survived least one major fall , some bumps here there . only thing i've noticed lately pictures turning up slight greenish feel them . i'm pretty avid photoshop know how correct pics get them lifelike colors , difference isn't bad . not many people notice it , but i , maybe since i like edit photos very much . end , if you don't alot money want get most " bang your buck " , go this one - specially if you just starting digital camera world i moment purchase	1
i like camera , but dont remote control , not its so much important me . i used indoor quality poor , but its amazin color outdoor , fact mp4 its very funciolannly !! if you like upload videos youtube . this camera you	-1

i bought this camera few days ago purpose going travelling . this camera great . while i could bought 7 or 8 mp camera , there really no point ; this camera 5mp easily blown up a4 size ... who needs larger than ? i find battery not last long , so i bought 2 spare . ( shop around cheap prices though ... sony wanted charge au$70 ( us$50 ) or so ' np-fe1 ' ' infolithium battery ' , but i found website sold them only au$24 ( us$18) ! lcd screen seems drain lot power , but who really uses their viewfinder now anyway ? sound quality video mode not best , but still legible . all all , this great camera . i would recommend it anyone just wanting small camera great quality travels well .	1
this wonderful camera ! i got it christmas ' 05 . i took somewhere close 6,000 pictures it . digic ii processor it beast ! you could just take photo after photo after photo it . very little shutter lag , maybe just smidge . bunch helpful modes making it very easy use . my only complaint though mine died suddenly , just wouldn't start one day ! no amount charging or monkeying would bring it back life . i believe it some sort lens error , but i really won't ever know . handed it customer service , looked it , told me it broke i needed buy new one . upsetting ..	-1
bought this replacement my jvc original battery not hold charge anymore . i wanted get it wedding coming up unfortunately it didnt arrive time , but i finally get it it exactly what i needed . charge holds no interuptions . good buy	1
i am very pleased sony vct680rm tripod it joy use price affordable	-1
i bought this tripod video tapping upcomming family wedding tried it couple times get used it . i like smooth operation controls handle . panning operation likewise acceptable . telescopic locking legs work well , but light weight rock little during panning . lightness also plus because it collapses into small over shoulder bag easy toteing . one hand tripod stabilization one control handle during panning works well .	-1
i love this camera . color great , so fun makes me feel unique . screen great size , it takes great pictures . good red eye issue . menu great too , when you scroll thru things , it tells you what it so you don't memorize it all . takes fast pictures , but not one after , like i hoping . but it open fast . don't fooled big memory , you still need larger card . depending size pic you want , you take 30 50 pics memory alone . but all all i love this camera it great buy	-1
i bought this present my wife . i looking something she could carry her purse . automatic functions easy functional . it not enthusiasts camera : too hard get into menus . screen easy turn off(this sucks battery power ) . it even optical viewfinder(a rare finding lately ) optical viewfinder helps get steady pictures those us shakes . pictures clear colors excellent . drawback sony batteries cost arm leg . wire downloading pix multifunctional very proprietary(read expensive if you lose it	1
i've this camera two months now i really like it . fact it image stabilization means i yet take blurry picture . also , zoom quite impressive . nifty feature you overlay grid help photo composition(the " rule thirds " ) . only caveat this camera lack optical viewfinder , so you can't really turn off lcd save battery power . i never batteries die out me , so i don't really consider it problem , although you may	1
i got this camera when price it took nosedive . i found i wasn't carrying my powershot s2 around outdoors much because size issue . this one i bring anywhere . picture quality low iso just good best superzoom cameras , leica lens gives very clear rendition any scene . build quality fantastic , solid metal large , bright high resolution screen . focus times decent , par other superzooms . lens hardly extends outward all , folded optics really shrink footprint camera . however ..... shooting indoors or high iso issue entirely . noise big problem above iso 100 . flash pathetically weak . iso 80 , flash only rated around 3 feet ! this not camera indoors or low light . movie mode decent , but nothing write home . widescreen 848x480 mode interesting , but overall quality couple steps down powershot s2 or s3 . sound especially weak comparison . positive note , you zoom during filming . tz line cameras designated " travel " . if you plan using this camera ( well lit outdoors ) , it great choice . all one solution , i can't fully recommend it .	-1
this cute little perfect camera . other than fact ccd base assembly needed replacement after few months ( generating lens cap error even though it not place ) , it always excellent camera . far ccd , just call 800 number mentioned above , give them your serial number other pertinent info you're set . i live near factory cypress i camera back one week ! that service ! it free	-1
please go into this purchase knowing you aren't going get quality $ 1,000 camera $350 i think you pleased . yes , some things annoying like led lights spotlight focused small area " night mode " slowing down shutter so it choppy . but compared previous canon i owned , it great . low light shooting much better even out light , colors much more vibrant distinct . i burn my movies dvd difference this jvc my canon substantial . there very little no pixelation or rough dithering low light jvc . it somewhat grainy but all cams low light . drivers not working , mentioned some reviews , xp pro xp home both recognized cam soon i plugged it driver disk wasn't even needed . i work company sells consumer electronics 70% returns we get not because product defective , but because user can't figure it out . go retailer who least 14 day return policy try it out . if you don't like it , return it try something else . just don't expect corvette performance chevette price you'll happy this .	-1
this accesory kit perfect companion your dcr-405 . it fits perfectly main compartment it very portable . it must handycam propietary !!	1
sony alpha a100k best camera i ever owned . images nothing short spectacular . lens mount allows you use telephoto lenses other camera . i expensive telephoto lens my old 35mm minolta it fit this sony digital perfectly . you notice lot minolta features this sony since minolta left camera business . image stabilization feature makes it real hard mess up shot . if you beginner or pro , this camera easy use perfect pictures every time	1
echoing what most others said , this great camera . it dream use , pictures stunning . since it based minolta design , it accepts lenses my old minolta maxxum 9000 ( circa mid 1980s ) . this huge benefit me ; i now excellent quality 70-210mm zoom lens my new alpha-100 no additional cost ! auto-focus ttl metering work properly , since anti-shake hardware camera body , works old lens also . even my old minolta cable release ( switch end electrical cable proprietary rectangular plug ) connects works fine . i'm very happy camera . said , there couple annoyances . one them might significant you , depending how you want use camera . first , noise . not picture noise , grainy low-light photos , but acoustic noise . shutter mechanism * loud * , much louder than my old maxxum 9000 . if you want unnoticed photographer taking discreet pictures like cartier-bresson his leica , this isn't your camera . second , lens shade . this nit , but i find it more clumsy use than lens shade old camera . old one held spring clasp ; you just squeeze opposite sides install or remove it , or reverse it storage . new one positioned precisely so tabs lock into place when it turned . not quick or easy use , but not really big deal . i suppose it saved couple dollars , new one one piece plastic while old one several parts . whole , excellent product . i'd buy it again heartbeat	1
great camera , no wonder it named " camera year " . fast , clear accurate describe camera photos it produces . i camera month it all i expected . super steady feature truly gives two stops . kit lens useful quite bargin . i use it more than i thought i would . i truly get same feel results i my old maxxium slr	1
this camera made picture taking easy fun again . only thing missing case/carrier	1
there reason why this camera rated number 1 amazon . i highly suggest buying it ; it easy use quality wonderful . get 2gb memory card , it worth extra few bucks , you never need delete pics again	1
i took this camera week long trip florida . i never lost charge made over 1.5 gbs content this camera . video camera not slr . please not expect professional quality images this camera . however if you want shot video , this camera you . buy 1gb memory card start shooting your favorite family moments . i suggest using 640x480 mode so your video dvd quality . zoom ... video zoom great . i shot some offroad video my jeep able easily zoom over 100 ft away jeep while shoting . i never installed camera software my windows xp based pc . instead i used secure digital memory card reader pulled files card . $145 this video camera replaced my mustek dv4500 . i threw this camera around , ran it battery down let it sit black jeep sun two days . after i all this camera still running . controls camera not complicated like other video cameras this genre either . all this said , one could make case cheap camera like this could easily used younger generation , easily . pros : 1 ) 640x480 video recording seamless excellent audio streaming . 2 ) long battery life ( held charge 1.5 gbs worth pictures video recording)3 ) video stabilization really make video smoother . 4 ) take 1gb memory cards5 ) if you wait 1/4 second , 5mp photos come out well camera no real lens . 6 ) best image quality any solid state video camera this genre . cons : 1 ) poor flash photography2 ) images : shutter lag over 1/4 second . 3 ) battery charging requires removal battery . update 9/7/2006 : i am still using camera . i keep it my jeep during hot louisiana days , no problems . i really like quick boot time camera ; 5 seconds or less . i instantly shot video or take picture press button	-1
price $130 , this great little camera . course , it not going good 400-600 dollar cameras but beginners or people who just want use it some fun easy clips pictures , i would highly recommend it . i am 12 years old this camera works excellently me but if you looking long term professional camera , spend extra money buy better one . it simple use good ages around 11-14 . :	1
it pleasent surprise , because camera smaller than i thought . easy use , light night shots audio good ... i definetly would reccomend it	-1
i recently purchased rebel t2 camera body only after my canon eos rebel 2000 gave its " last gasp " . i canon user since 1979 ae-1 ( i still ) . i liked fact t2 body plugged immediately into two ef lenses i owned ( 28-80mm 75-300mm ) , which protected my previous investments . i taking pictures within seconds opening package loading batteries . although i my sights set digital rebel some point soon , you just can't beat quality traditional 35-mm film photoprocessing . upgrade over eos rebel 2000 , lcd located camera back easier read . also , t2 seems more " solid " me , but lighter weight . i took older eos rebel 2000 me couple 75-mile backpacks ( which probably led its early demise ) , so i now new-found respect lighter design . final note , i also appreciated ease ordering via amazon.com . there plenty web sites offering same canon t2 camera back , including those which would saved me few dollars . but none long-standing relationship i amazon over past several years	1

i just purchased this item , i am definitely impressed . i just baby , it perfect way showcase pictures my baby without search through my wallet find pictures ! ( would make good baby shower gift ! ) photo quality not sharpest , but it good enough , even when i don't crop pictures . btw , crop feature not just one size , you pull box out diagnally lower right hand corner . it took no time all download software upload pictures ( you view picture you selecting your computer if you click file name - it show you picture screen below so you know which picture you choosing before adding it , while also giving you chance crop ) . overall , i am very happy this product !	-1
all previous reviewers who gave this camera 1 star , i only guess they far too high expectations or tried dropping it eiffel tower then take picture it ... this camera incredibly durable , survived many drops , good enough picture quality my family members brought it several overseas trips used its pictures powerpoint . summary -- pros : - good picture quality , not grainy- takes smooth video , although no sound- flash illuminates dark scenes wellcons : - if you take too many pictures fast succession , it take several seconds " recover " . - zoom rapidly degrades picture quality -- but that expected digital zoom . - you install software go through fancy picture transfer process , whereas most cameras simply show up removable disk my computer when you connect them . pro/con : - mac-friendly/pc-unfriendly . movie files quicktime . mov format rather than good old universal avi	1
i originally thought smaller camera would allow cool " side-camera " those times when i didn't feel like carrying my " regular-sized " camera around . after receiving nikon coolpix p3 - my mind changed ! this now first only camera i'll taking me . it incredibly easy set up learn . no time , i taking shots lots different pre-set scenes , allowing auto feature take control shot decisions , even uploading photos our secure wireless network . most amazing feature i never expected such small camera flash . i am 35 years old never my life photo taken where my eyes weren't red . includes all digital cameras red eye reduction features supposed correct it . i stunned discover this camera - - - -no more red eyes ! i can't recommend this camera enough . if you get one , you'll likely find it only camera you'll need no time	1

small size rugged construction makes this camera very practical traveling . availability numerous settings enables capturing high quality pictures under various conditions . this camera produced many excellent photographs	1
good pixel quality , fast focus , excelent color contrast . why spend lot bucks expensives slr ?	1
this camera i nearly all features my slr film camera 5 lenses . additionally , 9 mp resolution allows me crop enlarge much i desire . short battery life annoying , but minor price pay so much capability small package	-1
i bought this camcorder few days back this one buy iam not going regret . spite some drawbacks , seeing yourself hd gives you real high . picture quality awesome . its like stack 5-6 mega pixel images put together . i infact paused video few places taken screenshots them . lack video editing tools drawback . sony provides tools convert . 264 mpeg . so i use mpeg files sony vegas . audio quality excellent . great camcorder when shooting outdoors . night time shooting needs improvement . spot lot noise video when shooting dark . i would recommend buy rw disk dump all its contents your computer , then erase dvd contents .	-1
this ball head great my compact tripod setup . holds my nikon d80 18-200 lens just fine . light beautifully constructed	1
this tripod very good . only one bad thing i think all plastic . knobs crank all plastic , giving this tripod cheap feeling .	-1
i purchased this unit after i bought my canon zr25mc digital camcorder . i used it often when filming sporting events action , adjustable resistance offers fluid movement when trying follow action if you speed up , camera not jerk ( long tension set high enough ) . i recently bought canon g2 digital still well . again , extendable height proved usefull get good view group shot , or even landscape or two . it light enough i cary it hooked onto my camera bag ( probably around 3 pounds ) when i hike take pictures mountains . it not too stable uneven terrain , but really it not designed kind work anyway it seems . overall it served me well , i think someone looking inexpensive ( virtually disposable ) tripod would well this model	-1
great product , good quality , size expected said manufacturer . detachable compartment great carrying cables , manuals other accessories . i'm using it taking my canon zr700 camcorder my fujifilm s5200 slr like digicam , both fits perfectly inside same time . only one thing i didn't like , main compartment separator attached case leaving little chance organize things desired . because this matter i am giving this product 4 stars not 5	-1

soy un principiante en esto de la fotografia , esta ha sido mi primera camara slr , por lo tanto me ha tocado experimentar con ella para obtener las mejores tomas posibles la vez que han aumentado mis conocimientos en el area , el desempe�o es excelente tanto en tomas fijas como las que he realizado objetos en movimiento , tanto sus funciones automaticas como las profesionales ofrecen un desempe�o excelente , he tomado mas de 300 fotos en poco menos de cuatro meses , el zoom que tiene es rapido , los botones tienen una disposicion excelente para manejarla con una sola mano , lo unico que necesita es un flash de la serie speedlite , tuve oportunidad de conseguir uno prestado de un amigo el cambio fue estupendo ya que este tiene mas alcance para el lente que la camara trae , ya que el flash que trae carece de potencia el cual ofrece su mejor desempe�o en los 28mm del lente(no le podemos pedir mas un flash integrado ) , por ultimo les dijo que posee el mejor sistema de medicion de luz que existe en el mercado ( e-ttl)y esta disponible tanto con flash integrado como con el flash externo	1
picture quality exceptional it very easy use . so much nicer than punching screen menus like sony 405 . who wants worry finger prints scratches all over screen those touch screens ? it also priced better than sony 405 . we researched these cameras lot before settling panasonic , picture quality our #1 objective . we more than pleased our purchase !!	1
i reviewed many dvd camcorders over 4-5 month period feel this best choice . i almost purchased sony dvd405 , but color one first priorities my list wants this new camcorder . although sony better chip , fact panasonic , 3 chips , according many reviews i read better color . ease use nice also . finalizing dvd takes only few minutes not really big deal , my only issue so far fade control which requires operator select it via joystick control each time you want use it . selecting this control while recording requires steady hand so camera not shake . none less , it puts my eleven year old , 8mm camcorder shame . love taking videos again	-1
i received hv20 yesterday after charging battery i hit woods . i wanted see how well it worked cloudy day outdoors . it surpassed what i expected picture quality . i also tried it dark basement corner under normal lighting inside . dark corner needs additional light hv20 . 100 watt bulb turned it really surprised me . detail far better than what i expected . reason i gave it 4star rating power switch cap hdmi plug . both not very well thought out my opinion . my point quality hd outstanding when i played film back i heard birds singing i not notice woods . sound outstanding !! i agree one other review power switch hard operate . retrospect if you want excellent quality hd picture i would recommend canon hv20 . after all it excellent picture reasonable price high definition camcorder . i would think , what most people want consumer camcorder . i viewed film my 42 " 50 " plasma tv ( sharp tack ) 04/12/07 i used my hv20 over easter holiday more impressed . my outdoor shots it better any camcorder i . inside it took outstanding video no external video light attached . still photos i took good one first 3 mega pixel digital camera i use . i purchased it video alone , but it nice quality still photo too .	-1
considering what most people buy this , including myself , it great little camera . not too large , not too small unusable . quality when hooked up hd monitor quite amazing . i switched footage shot during day cam our local hd pbs channel . i could not tell difference . this 1080i through component connection , not hdmi . i only imagine what hdmi looks like . i also like tape vs hard drive . if you go 3 week vacation somewhere , you buy tapes or bring extras instead portable hard drive storage . what i understand there less compression tapes . tapes actually get you better quality . i also use pro cameras videography miss ability constant shutter speed aperture . when pointing up my daughter against blue sky , it adjusts bright sky my daughter face gets dark . there backlight button which probably trick , but instant exposure dial would great . con , zoom rocker tiny . even my little fingers hard time zooming smoothly . i also noticed when editing , it takes more cpu even preview footage due compression . if you older machine wanting edit , just aware it may tad slower . other than few nitpicks , quality price bargain . i've waiting consumer 24p hd cam vacations long time . it arrived relatively cheap .	-1
my fujifilm f700 takes great photos , but runs low battery before you even get fill up card . i bought 650mah generic equivalent amazon seller it works great . it light enough carry around just like memory card it really easy change batteries when i need . product little pricey $40 , so buy amazon seller . if you find one cheap this must-have your camera	1

i bought this bag sony dcr trv19 mini dv camcorder . it enough room cables , power supply , external mic three tapes . not huge but sufficient if you want keep size minimum . i owned targus laptop computer bags found them high quality durability . so far this bag living up its legacy . i bought it sale 9.99 . i would still pay 12 bucks it	1

this great compact camera easy use same time capable more . viewfinder or digital display large enough see your photos . resolution great . dock wierd design , but you not use it . overall i am very pleased this camera .	-1
i am probably repeating previous comments , but : 1 . super wide angle lens nicest feature camera . no more backing into walls get everyone shot . 2 . camera doesn't handle low light situations well . i consider most indoor situations without really bright lights or large window nearby " low light " . flash handles close portrait shots ok , but everything else left something desired . no matter how steady i hold camera i get slightly blurred image . even when " blur indicator " indicates good shot , it slightly blurry computer monitor or 4x6 prints . my three-year old canon s400 yields better low light pictures . 3 . i put docking station back box after one use . charge battery directly cable included ; use card reader sd card . references flimsy sd card cover probably referring plastic hinge cover . we same type plastic hinges field surveying equipment get heavy use daily they holdup fine . i am keeping this camera throw into coat pocket/wife purse when we want travel light . i'm upgrading image stabilized canon sd800 when quality indoor pictures means mor e.p.s. check out v705 not much more $'	-1
i've xt 4.5 year now , even though i since purchased xt10 , i still use xt 4.5 more frequently because you just pick it up w/ one hand , carry it outside , begin scanning sky . even though 4.5 inch primary mirror small dobsonian telescope , this serious piece equipment money . this no cheap " department store junk " scope . perfect quick observing session , or just check quality " seeing " before you drag out " big one " . one my nephews who looked through this scope asked me what i going w/ little 4.5 now i bigger xt10 . looks like i'll buy him one his own because i'm not parting w/ mine .	1
i purchased this scope almost year ago my first scope love it . it easy use easily portable . lt ; 20 lbs it easily carried one hand using handle . it gives good views moon planets , particularly if you add barlow lense double power provided eyepieces , but also big enough ( 4.5 " ) begin show beauty deep-sky objects ( galaxies , nebulae , star clusters , etc ) . i viewed most messier deep-sky list already . because it not tripod , it also easy kids view through eyepiece because they not need get step ladder . now i am sure i really into astronomy hobby , i am ready move larger telescope , but i keep this one give it my kids so they start enjoy night sky	1
even though amazon specifically recommended this bag panasonic lumix ( dmc-fz20pp ) camera , even though i return it because it too small , even though my camera not appear compatibility list shown customer review , amazon annoyingly continues recommend this bag my camera . add insult injury , amazon tried deduct shipping my refund claiming error not their fault . ( it took two emails get full refund , even after i put large message my return box not deduct shipping -- aargh ! )regarding bag itself , construction seemed sound this might good bag small point-and-click camera requires no accesories	-1
this product so cool . whatever your situation , if you lot digital pictures , then i recommend going out getting sd card ... preferably up 1gb ( or even 512mb ) , use this this product . even if your camera doesn't use sd , you plop sd card right into picture frame upload photos your computer card ! it like little computer , this frame . big suggestion i find program online resizes your photos dimensions frame ( photo size explained other reviews ) . ( i downloaded visualizer photo resize ) . this take photos down its original size ( e.g. 1.8 mb ) smaller size ( e.g. 500kb ) . this let your store dramatically more photos . so far i fit over 1700 photos 430mb worth 1gb sd card i ! picture quality very good frame swivel basically any angle could used horizontally or vertically . plus , it philips , which great brand . i philips hd tv well it my baby ... i love it . this great present anyone ! how you go wrong picture frame replaces its picture any time you want	1

i've owned printer dock plus series 3 6 months , found it make better prints than i could get my canon 960 . so i sold canon . canon inkjet inks dried up if i didn't use printer month or so , ink cartridges $12 each . kodak inks not appear dry up over extended non-use . so i'm saving bundle replacing expensive ink cartridges . i keep 8 year old epson ink jet just print 8x10 , i go ebay buy cheapest color cartridges i find which $10 color black white cartridge . it works great short term school work reports . i teach digital camera classes local schools , kodak easy share software editor universally despised loathed . don't install easy share software , if you install it , go into settings make sure it doesn't run start up . you don't need software if you just printing your camera . once this software installed , it programmed automatically try copy pictures anytime you insert device such usb , cd , dvd or camera . if you want use dock your pc printer , you just hook it up via usb cable install printer drivers . you option not installing easyshare software editor . once this hooked up , you just manually copy photos your camera memory card your pc via usb card reader , print 4x6s your favorite photo editor . if you looking photo editor print simple things like darken lighten , red eye correction , then use google picasa . it free , terrific user interface , you easily print picasa your kodak printer once printer attached your pc via usb cable . prints perfect , fast , durable , i never problem print quality . however you must order 160 pack paper amazon which get your price per print down 25 cents print . amazon very best deal this paper .	1

two-element close-up lens digital zoom lens pretty effectively replaces very expensive macro lens . this excellent workaround results very good . not confuse this item standard single element closeup lens ( or set ) . it two element lens worth every penny lieu several hundred dollars you might spend true macro lens	1

i recently purchased this camera when my venerable nikormat el-w developed shutter timing issues during my photo 1 class . this camera reasonably priced preformed flawlessly thus far . i shot multiple rolls ilford hp5 plus film through this camera yet exposure not come out due camera . after reading manual i able easily understand different modes how change user controlled settings . camera flash leaves little desired it rather harsh its range somewhat limited , accessory flash overcome this there other flashes operate this camera not just canon . i not opportunity shooting color film through this camera yet when i i update this review . only thing i dislike this camera there no provision remote shutter release . rebel k2 date only version this camera use remote shutter release , why canon removed this feature this model unknown remote release very handy when photographing nature or when used timer self portraits . if you any plans infrared photography not buy eos canon , frame counter uses infrared sensor cause fogging your infrared film	-1
photos exceptional . it very easy learn how use features . i taken some great photos it , much better than my digital . i not encountered any problems . i took it long ( over month ) trip where it subjected rough treatment extreme weather . it came through flying colors . rock solid	1
i've this battery month or so , upon each consecutive use/charge , i'd say i'm pleased . when fully charged , camera battery indicator usually says 170-180 min total-use time ... which what it claims . it take awhile re-charge ... 2 1/2 hrs camera , but that not too bad	-1

given i typically use cradle transfer photos keep my battery charged , i not much need use this charger . however , it worked advertised few occasions i used it . me compactness unit flip-out plug great features	1
i bought this camera after dpreview told me it ( well , actually , its leica sibling ) fits all my needs , namely : compact , raw , aperture priority , plus optical stabilization . what i like : large screen , raw , fairly decent flashwhat i dislike : it actually takes raw + jpeg which wastes space my card . however , it gives me interesting comparison . 90% time , i prefer raw version , albeit tweaked . jpeg colors just don't look right me . i'm also unimpressed image stabilization , warranty just terrible . 90 days ??? what ? also , manual focus without viewfinder takes getting used . i won't argue there noise higher isos , but it not nearly bad i expected other reviews . i haven't decided yet whether i'm keeping camera ; if you're not hurry , hold off see if they release new version summer . course , their track record , they won't fix any problems , just squeeze few more mp out chip	-1
meets all expectations . questions noise greatly overblown . image stabilation reduces impact noise low light . people really expect get great image very low light condition ? regardless noise contrast too low get quality image except very special circumstances . up until last few years iso 400 film similar problems iso 800 virtually useless except get image . when i got this camera i took numerous pictures night inside got very good quality pictures without flash . far better than my old ditigal better than my film camera . lcd size image quality really impressive . best i seen	1
i bought this item my father christmas . he uses it his video camera . money this tripod everything average person would need . quick release great feature he didn't his old one , he likes lot . i don't know professional use , but personal use it great	1

i bought this camera replace kodak easyshare 5.0 mp digital camera i ( it stolen , unfortunately ) . this model very much like previous 5.0 version . it very easy use , which i consider it strong point . process taking reviewing picture simple doesn't require user go menu screens such , some digital cameras . i like easy share software included camera . it makes downloading pictures your camera your computer quick . battery life very good too . only complaint i some pictures dim light come out little fuzzy , even flash . all all , i think it good camera money	-1
bought this one my wife . she loves it . handling look/feel impeccable . so size . shots we took great when all works : flash , focus , etc . but sometimes flash tends slow recycle shots turn out dark , previous reviewers mentioned . trick seems , don't take try take consecutive shots this thing . it what it : toy like small mug shot camera . if you want something serious , go dslrs . again , when camera work , pictures turn out great . it usual shortcomings this type cutie cameras - no view finder , vulnerable big lcd , short battery life , weak flash , so . but so all other competitors . important thing , when it works , picture quality dslr quality . it work most time , if you patient careful . i found usb clipper power cord without craddle fantastic . my sony dv cam requires craddle everything , driving me nuts . i like just plug it get it , hassle free , great ! more " advanced features " camera , modes customization etc . i advise - try it your own risk . didn't work too well me . i stick fully auto mode this one . if you serious using thse fancy features , you really should try dslr . this type cutie cameras not cut out it . oh , video quality fine , but nothing special there either . my only complaint it doesn't come cute little case matches camera . way , i didn't high expectations this kodak camera ( or any kodak camera ) when i bought it . it purely its cuteness ( gift wife ) . picture quality really exceeded my expectation big margin . highly recommended	1
great camera when i don't want lug slr . fits nice shirt pocket but it feels little heavy . very fast startup , so you ready shot hurry . i bought extra battery universal charger because i lot indoor , flash shots . gets 100 those pics charge . i suspect you get many more without flash . sure bring charger your trips	-1
very good compact camera . excellent take around fits perfectly pocekts	-1
well , i finally bought sony r1 , after wait price drop , read all reviews it .. i got it 565$ . what i like r1 : build quality , good zeiss lens , 24mm wide angle , iso change cam just botton .. great colors balance , low noise high iso , big cmos sensor , use both pro stick cf card , long battery life , displays batt life mins , useable high iso 400 , top view swivel lcd , manual tele zoomring , good raw files . what i dont like : battery charges camera big draw back , while you charge batt , you cant use camera shoot , bad feature , hope sony improves it next camera . camera design so weird , grip over size , off balance hand , view finder housing over size , use external flash you go menu change it everytime , change back use pop up flash , cant use both flashes , missing ois(opical image stabilizer ) , its heavy big , tele 120mm 4.8 , af not fast , its kinda slow , especially dark , sony should learn this cam improves it next camera , im sure they . price abit too high point shoot , no video mode , macro too far subject , 15 niches . other than i love use it , its my main camera walk around , i love image result quality , thats why i bought it , i know no camera perfect yet . price i paid im not complainning . its dslr wanna , very close dslr results . i strongly suggest any one who wants back up dslr .	-1
great travel camera . i leave my canon d20 kit home . fact , i find myself using this thing all time--it very easy use , love ergonomics . only caveats -- high iso ratings way too noisy , not nearly good canon . also , excellent lens too short telephoto end . otherwise , one best lenses out there . battery performance excellent . bulky , but light . buy high quality protective filter , like b+w or hoya . use it enjoy	1

this first decent digital cameras i ever owned . i am not sure what deal people complaining battery life . buy recharger . i used same batteries two years i owned this camera . i run into glitches time time most likely due me putting batteries there when they not fully charged(yes i am inpatient ) sometimes camera looks like it took picture then it crashes . other times it not turn off . opening re-closing battery door always fixes it . i am sure both these issues due me putting weak batteries . durability ? i am not sure what deal people complaining no lens cover . who cares ? i dropped this camera so many times i cannot even begin count ! this thing built really well !! i never worry putting camera down lens up . i just toss it my desk when i am it . still takes great pictures . i bitched this camera time time but i taken nearly 1100 pictures it it still going strong . now memory cards so cheap , i finally bought one camera . 1 gig one let you take 4000 (!!!) low definition pictures . course low def like 1024x768 this camera . my only beef why not vga resolution anymore ? i always shrink pics down use this ebay .	-1

starter kit better value than buying all these items separately . bag able put all essentials like spare tapes , cables , batteries . if bag just little bit bigger more storage would perfect . overall good value especially since extended battery lasts 4 hours regular use compared just over 1 hour standard battery	-1
all all , great value , but bag could just little bigger all accessories	1
bought these binoculars my husband . he loves them . they very powerful he loves way they feel - not too heavy . he look stuff across creek amazed clarity things he sees	1
i bought it gift digital camera/video i'd gotten few years ago , so i could send it couple who new baby boy . they pleased it thanked me such great gift not only camera but also charger battery would last 8 hrs shoot their christmas 2006	1
it just what charger should : light weight , simple use , dependable . i would recommend it over any other charger	-1
i bought this battery charger addition extra battery my canon g3 digital camera . reason canon really short-sighted not shipping camera least external charger . price i paid , they could least that!it really good camera 1 or 2 quirks you get used . excellent quality photos . but you can't use camera while it charging battery . after 2 years i finally gave bought this charger . someone must suffering guilty conscience canon , cause it came 5 different power cables , so i plug into almost any power outlet world . just careful note difference cables usa japan , because they almost identical	-1
fast lense decent price . can't go wrong this one	1
i purchased this lens supplement my kit 18-55 which i found wasn't fast enough capture indoor shots my two little girls without flash . i say everyone should buy this lens . one first additional lenses i purchased my nikon d40 , i absolutely stunned blown away tack sharp images speed this tiny little gem . while it manual focus only d40 , everything else works just fine . it even tells you when image focus via green focus light found inside viewfinder . keep mind 1.8 its easy your main subject slip out focus . portrait shots , 2.8 usually plenty get fast shutter speed plenty bokeh . those split this 1.4 , if price difference wasn't so big , i'd say go it . but 1.8 you're getting extremely fast capable lens price just cannot beat . i'm filling up my hard drive every day pics i simply could not captured my kit lens . there some shortcomings like manual zoom , manual focus d40 it small plastic casing probably won't survive fall ( my 70-300 vr massive next it ) but it more than makes up its shortcomings amazing shots it takes . i promise you , you'll hard pressed find any other quality glass this price range	1
i tried many different camcorders/digital cameras before landing onto this one samsung . both camera camcorder let me make excellent quality pictures movies my own . sounds also real great without any noticeable mechanical noise . i also impressed way it adjusts brightness flash light automatically depending places . controls buttons easy operate but took me couple days get used it . when compared ones jvc or sony , scd6550 clear winner unbeatable price quality . i am not professional photographer so i cannot evaluate machine too technical terms . but , large , this dual functional camcorder fully serves my needs most portable way . i strongly recommend this product personal family use	1
i hp took okay pictures but close-ups blurry . i tried kodak easy share . pictures " okay " but it took very long time transfer them . close ups little blurry . deceiding kodak not wise choice . it then i recalled best photos i ever taken nikon pictures looked good some even better thanpostcards . seriously ! i ventured out one more time buy digital camera i would try one more . thankfully , nikon stopped my camera blues . this camera alot great features . it works great small items like jewelry . i am very happy withthe quality . although it little bigger than other twodigitals i bought , i not mind . if you not concerned quality want camera fit your pocket then buy hp or kodak . you want sharp vibrant pictures ? if , yes . here your answer .	1
i chance work this camera 2 months . it lot options i tried most them . panorama shots cool . camera takes nice pictures . it relatively heavier bulkier . battery not lasting long always issue digital . i recommend powerex battery charger . best longest lasting batteries . huge number megapixels lets you zoom really close computer . i took series picture my cat it going bite hand it funny look facial expressions change close zoom . i like canon slightly better , because it more handy . but salesman said this choice like two very similar cars , just made different company . perhaps .	1
great size shape taking places . feels good your hand . boots up pretty quick . like color . impressed features . takes decent pictures . internal memory , well taking memory card . i suggest getting set good rechargable batteries .	1
i bought olympus c-750 ultra zoom camera 3 years ago this charger batteries included package . i able take up 400-500 pictures per charge . ( includes taking alot pictures flash ) . batteries take 9 hours charge completely but it well worth it .... just charge them over night you sleep . i never worry carrying spare batteries or running out battery life . i took camera 2 week vacation through midwest able take all my vacation pics plus more personal pics when i arrived back home still plenty battery life left !!!!.... buy these .... you wont regret it !!!	1
i little dubious when ordering this , quality clarity lens view they would give , i should not worried , they top class . units quite light too ! now add camera functions it it top shelf . i use it deer hunting new zealand , during ' stalk ' you see some interesting things , animals fighting , bonking , doing different things which i always thought if only i camera ! often i come out bush say i saw 4 today 18 21 pointer spiker hind , some give you look disbelief , now its ' hey look these ones i saw today ' oh cop size this boar i saw across river . only reason i didn't give this 5 out 5 i feel conttrols could , easier , once you used them , they good but its fine tooth thru instructions , get it right . good unit recommend it all	-1
i firm believer digimax line since they first introduced . i owned both digimax 201 digimax s600 i loved both those cameras , however , s800 more than exceeded my expectations . i use this camera photographing handmade items i sell ebay it captures details exquisitely . i also use s800 photograph family events come up it worked well many situations , even those held inside or particularly dark settings . i'd recommend s800 anyone who looking easy use , effective camera . i haven't found any problems this camera	1
i agree . pauley review . i've owned this camera six months taken it several long trips already . pictures i've taken stunning regardless lighting , i couldn't happier . i'd buy this samsung again without reservation . 8mp this price -- great quality photos--can't beat	1
got p712 upgrade gift over holidays . i think learning curve past me this point now handle how take decent photo this super-zoom . here what you might like : * excellent zoom lens world class optics . * shooting photo auto mode makes picture taking easy . * 7.1 mp provides good detail . * very good battery life . 200+ shots using rechargeable included . * manual mode , shutter priority mode aperture mode great serious amateur . * uses sd cards which inexpensive easily found . * all it metering through lens so filters add optics work well . * true optical image stabilization . few reviews mentioned kodak add lenses . i both telephoto wide angle must say they really extend optical range p712 . telephoto turns camera into 635mm lens , wide angle down 20mm . flash kodak markets this unit also pro level enough " oompf " light auditorium . i'm pleased impressed this camera . i'm getting great shots it . i think you too . any downshots ? few : * video marred sound auto-focus . forget using zoom while making video , it sounds like truck driving . * tends overexpose little bright sunlight auto mode . * not pocketable-this substantial camera .	1
awesome camera . still trying learn how use all features but even little we know it takes awesome pictures	1
i bought this camera because large lcd . general , i am pretty happy f650 , price right . it takes great pictures very little lag shots which big improvement my last camera . i purchased xd card circuit city , they only sold olympus cards i figured brand didn't matter . i found 50% shots saved xd card corrupted garbled . so , while vacation i bought xd card , this time fuji brand , it working fine ever since . i don't know if i just got bad card or if you must use fuji card fuji camera . only other thing i don't care it not ergonomic i always feel like i ( or someone else holding it ) drop it . i use wrist strap every time i pick it up .	-1
i wanted replace my fuji e550 this logical choice . i wanted able use my xd picture cards . after reading all reviews i opted get it i'm not disappointed . i love 3 " screen back menu very easy me follow since it similar my old one . i am anxious try all new setttings my old one never like fireworks , sunset , beach . i think you'll very happy this camera	1
item works perfectly . i guess one should expect this since it oem replacement part	1
only negative these binoculars they come really cheesy plastic strap , which i promptly threw away . otherwise they function fine bargain binocular	-1
this bit pricy what it , but useful handheld shots if your triprod doesn't balance indicator good thing use . nice compact seems decent quality .	-1
plastic o ring carrying case which holds large shoulder strap came broken . thus it renders case un-useable . time , my cost it would file complaint ship case back not worth it me . however if bushnell would send me new carrying case , i would very pleased transaction . howard . rutkowski	-1
case fitted well camera . there pocket extra memory card storeage card . only wish it carry handle .	-1
i bought this mobicam based recommendation friend . we really love able see hear baby vs . just listening monitor . infrared feature awesome - you see total darkness . i chose 900mhz so it wouldn't interfere 2.4 ghz wireless network nor cordless phones house . this one no interference any these devices . it tend pick up little static time time , but not really noticable . i guess i need read directions well .. because i yet figure out how turn monitor off during night ( it really bright ) , so right now we just kind point it towards wall . overall , we love it would purchase agai	-1
this just mp3 card reader , nothing else . if you getting sd card then it great , but don't think your kid going change his ipod ! i paid around $30 so it great . sound also good	-1
canon powershot s70 my opinion best point shoot camera you buy money . it all shooting modes slr camera would but slim compact design . set dial preset settings different situations or tweak more professional dial choices get perfect shot . though if you not up up digital cameras these settings may seem bit overwhelming . 7.1 mp your pictures come out extremely clear . most point shoot cameras only 3x optical zoom , but this baby 3.6 optical zoom . though sometimes this doesn't get close one would want . add-on easy find any store carries camera . i haven't any need extra battery but i would recommend getting 512mb compact flash ii even betting images . if you thinking you need camera substantial zoom then i would not suggest buying telephoto lens bought accessory . if you want close up images you take lens off then put it back zoom feature . over all , this camera great everyday use those who want all features professional slr digital cameras . i would highly recommend it anyone market new digital camera .	1
found this camera easy use , large 2.5 lcd monitor , good sharp pictures , suggest using ni-mh rechargeable batteries rather than alkaline ones more shots taken . voice mode 30 second movies . many shoot modes	1
you can't beat features this camera its price . very light weight , ergonomic , easy use . takes awesome macro shots , close you want . it little hard stay steady telefocus lens all way out . sometimes auto uses high iso my taste making picture little grainy during night shots . fully manual well . if you learn use manual controls you take just any shot you want clarity . i love my camera	1
we wide angle lens needed kodak lens adapter our camera . adapter lens work well . fantastic pictures vacation	1
i'm not entirely new photography . i two canon pocket cameras ( 35mm ) sony digital pocket camera , so i some expectations what could . i say fz50 blown me away . automatic mode , it great point shoot . i doubt i'll ever use it video clips , but i've able include pictures my power point presentations very helpful . i slowly acquainting myself various modes capabilities , such macros closeups . this process take several months least . well worth price . quality outstanding everything works it should . i'm not sure extra memory ( 10.1 mp ) actually necessary , if you could get fz30 less , would actually better deal most folks .	1
this camera takes great pictures travel outdoors . if you intend take family photo indoors you need large room group shots it 35-420 zoom . said i am very happy this camera it long list functions . software better than some i've seen . camera easy use right out box . make sure you buy memory card . battery ahs very long life but i bought spare so i wouldn't caught without my camera . my only complaint photo load slowly my computer compared other cameras	1
this not ink jet printer . it dye sublimation printer which means it produces same quality prints local one hour -- only it your house ! i not problems loading cartridge or paper . i printed my kodak camera , computer flash drive . unit small portable , my mind , easily replace idea using poloroid classroom display student picture " good behavior work " . i like fact paper ink coordinated because then i know when it run out . these prints far superior ink jet if you want commercial quality prints home -- this it	1
i bought this camera after tired my current fuji finepix a340 . a340 great camera , but time btw pix painfully slow me . plus , i needed excuse buy new camera ! z1 actually bought mistake . i after different camera , hastily bought this one i am extremely glad i . first i wary rechargeable battery going take it back , but i opted toy it few days firs t.t he rechargeable battery really no issue . you get 200px per charge there always option buying backup off ebay $40 . ( don't fall extended warranty crap some appliance stores . they told me it $60 if battery goes i get new one , well since i get 1.5 batteries warranty cost , i opted take my chances save my money)i love metal case practically instant when sliding cover . size smaller than deck cards but it doesn't feel fragile . there no view finder , which fine me , i never use it since i went digital anyway . there lot settings i found dark environments , this camera slick !!! easily best dark environment camera i've ever owned . i'm not photo expert , i take lot pictures , long they clear , crisp enough print if i choose , i'm happy . i am sure there other cameras others say better this or but casual photo taking endeavor , this fuji perfect	1

this particular barlow , orion shorty , highly recommended several astronomy forums internet . i got this one instead orion simply because amazon offering it $52 time . i've found i enjoy using barlow when viewing planets few dso . it provides economical way virtually increase number eyepieces your collection . it introduce little light loss my eyepieces ( maybe this normal all eyepieces ) , but it not troublesome . i certainly recommend this barlow those you who want cheaply expand your eyepiece collection	1
lenmar battery third party alternative original panasonic battery . this kind batteries mostly use lower quality materials , which result long charge times short use . however , this particular battery indistinguishable original panasonic battery battery life charging times . it turned out great second battery my fx-01 . it could come case , but since i case original battery i keep one batteries inside camera , there no need one	1
if you trying pick choose pix off your camera card , any digital frame disappointing you . these not $100 computers . this one jpg slide show , mp3 player bare bones mpg avi video player ! its primary use , you'll probably want enhance your images shrink file size display small lcd wide screen anyway . what i edit images real computer copy them empty flash device . i plug this into frame copy pix onboard memory . also great playing videos youtube etc . off plugin flash . only caveats : 1 . no support company web site . ( business opp ? ) 2 . my dell direct usb cabling flaky . drive appears disappears . if i'm quick i make transfer , but it easier use flash . course if you just want see what your camera card , just plug it .	-1

this camera fun use easy too . it great size keep my coat pocket all times . also 1 gb memory card i take many many pictures battery lasted few weeks before needing recharge . overall this good buy value .	-1
i great dslr i use " real " photography , but there times you just want throw camera your pocket go . samsung digimax great . 5 mp it great family ge t-t ogethers , business travel , kids playing , pets pets , etc . i'm not thrilled it didn't come case . it would nice just little pouch - even if it adds couple bucks price . perhaps i'm spoiled my " good " camera , zoom leaves little desired clarity department . transferring your computer super easy . i didn't even install software came it any my machines . i bought one my mother law well , so i recommend this camera non-tech savvy person . she able use it no issue . i'd also recommend it second camera	-1

solid construction , good finish . works great when used olympus sp-510 camera wide angle telephoto lenses this camera . i leave it screwed all times purchased attach 55mm lens dust cover . although this arrangement makes camera less portable it allows more stability when camera held . i feel it provide more protection lens assembly help prevent accidental touching/smudging lens .	1

glossy paper when making prints creates great dark blacks very white whites , if you're taking photography class plan using many sheets , i would highly recommend buying larger package rather than bunch small ones . you'll save money way too	1
this camcorder works very well thus far . very easy use without pour over included manual . i not tried use included software yet burn dvd , so i can't comment . they camcorder looks great , perfect size , great features others didn't ( built light ) seems take great videos all light conditions . i would hightly recommend this camera .	1

this camcorder not used record direct your computer or any new dvd recorders . you record first video tape then able connect your vcr dvd recording device . very disappointed . how hard it sony add usb port ? even my $100 digital camera usb port . don't waste your money camera already outdated technology	-1
i not consider using my camera without this battery pack ; all cameras should carry one	1

this excellent camcorder , it small , easy carry around , good battery life . it even fits into inexpensive carying case we our digital camera . it lot great features served us well our vacation . its said before , but only real drawback this instructions . claridy : camcorder transfer still pics its sd slot via usb cable , you need firewire transfer it computer or use webcam - both which work very well . it also all necessary cables you need if you just want hook it up your vhs/home dvd burner via a/v cables record , or just watch playback tv . it could use external audio mic output , but we found internal microphone quite sensitive met our needs very well . overall : definately recomende	1
great picture quality fast focusing when zooming . instructions confusing regarding how edit go back re-record over something	-1
i just bought this camcorder find it so easy use best feature me fact you view your videos your dvd player so easily !! i am not interested dowloading videos my computer or editing them some other reviewers mentioned , so it perfect me . i just want capture my kids motion am not looking create " perfect " movie my kids . i strongly recommend this product anyone looking great product which very easy use	1
i bought this camera my honeymoon , i expected lot snorkling thought price compared favorably purchasing several waterproof disposable cameras . camera case functioned properly easy use . pictures taken land turned out swell . undersea pictures okay , but could better . flash automatic , my opinion , camera would taken much better photographs if it could activated manually . all all , great inexpensive vacation camera , but don't expect take pictures like jacques cousteau	-1
okay , first foremost , this seems camera everyone forgot , including panasonic . go their website venture comparison page , it like no one bothered fill out spec sheet . if you go online search reviews this camera there no shortage criticism pro set , faulting it not this feature or , but once you research cameras those features cost grand two grand more ! ironically , this undeserved disdain neglect seems resulted real deal , both affordable versatile . it less features than some professional cameras more than most consumer cameras . it works great imovie great way me familiarize myself shooting general . it not hd , but neither 99.9% places it played . maybe i learn more i'll become more aware its limitations my opinion change , yes , lens smaller than i'd like , but 3ccd makes huge difference colors contrast . one thing bear mind , this great piece equipment someone who works professional directors videographers , but no way replacement such skilled outstanding professionals . basically , if you're director or videographer you'll want far more serious piece equipment , but if you're writer or art director who just wants firmer grasp shooting process this camera you ! all all , it great learn great price . not bad combination all .	-1
this my first digital camera , i lot search finaly i decide dsc-w55 black , what i looking , small enough it my purse , lot functions , very easy import pictures my computer , you only connect camera usb cable you don't need install software came camera , i windows vista i didn't any problems transfering pictures , best camera price great , you choose super saver shipping save more . you love this camera too , small , very pretty , lots options , take great pictures . some one wrote review this camera feels like plastic , that not true , looks very durable me i think good product worth every single dollar you spend . easy shoot pictures auto adjustment mode , start taking pictures sooner you charge battery , because this camera internal memory you buy memory card later . well hope you lots fun taking pictures , good luck ..!	1
i really love my first digital camera ! i searched i searched i finally found what i wanted . pictures crystal clear , movie playback exceptional - you only hear what you're supposed , no loud background noise or static , no muffled noise . pictures come out so clear after you take picture you zoom 5x count pores your face ! i love it ! i don't think i could ask better camera . i hope this camera last me atleast 4 years or more or until i graduate college . if one market afford it , get this camera ! there cheaper cameras but if you want get camera , get good one , doesn't mean it expensive , but my opinion you get what you pay . thanks reading . happy buying	1
i own e-300 bag full manual focusing olympus pentax lenses , which i use addition some auto-focus 4/3rds ones . glasses wearer i constantly adjusting my diopter straining get things into focus when using manuals , result perhaps 25% my shots unusable . this little magnifier makes big difference . several recent outings i absolutely great results . most shots sharp clear . there bit downside i work little harder see readout viewfinder , but i really don't need . don't expect eye-popping change , but change you notice . good product	1
i purchased many simulated security cameras . swann simulated security camera excellent quality construction housing design would fool even most skeptical viewers . long term battery life ( i cameras blinking light last long 8 months without change batteries ! ) . highly recommend	1
i no complaints . i this camera over year half it reliable , fast , gives me crisp , quality photos ! only option i wish this camera better stabilization mode prevent blurred pictures , but software edits blur without reducing quality . blurry pictures not problem long you know how aim shoot . everyone loves playing my camera because it many cool features make your photos fun ! i highly recommend this camera ( especially beginners or those who just want simple camera capture those precious moments , high quality photos ) . excellent camera overall ! ;	1
extremely easy use . price amazon terrific vs . circuit city offering . like way you view immediately dvd player . picture quality sunny conditions not good grainy digitial picture taking	-1
this camcorder very easy use , light , takes good video well decent stills . my only complaint would disk length - dvd still only holds 30 minutes video . i found some hold 60 , but only web , not stores	-1
video great . even lp setting quality good . able put 5,100 stills one dvd great . i always carry one dvd video stills . small , compact easy use . what more could you want	1
this really special purpose head . its best used monopod not tripod since you get enough tilt range tilting mononpod . only reasons you even use this monopod quick release or vertical shots . its just not flexible enough tripod . tripod use i'd suggest either bogen 486 or 488 ball heads , both which offer good value come quick release . any case , note this uses rc2 quick release . if you use camera supports even 20% time , you just keep quick release attached your slr . i've got two other heads all use rc2 system . adapter always my camera i easily attach it any my tripods/monopods . its really easy use encourages me set up tripod/monopod when i might otherwise get too lazy	1
this quick release tilt head works wonderful my monopod . i leave top part head connected my camera ( nikon d70s ) all time when i want use my monopod it just clicks place my monopod very securely off i go taking more pictures	1
it very nice case . beautiful small . i like it so much . it good protect my camera . i drop my camera case ground 2 times . it still work well . very nice	1
it works really well , but it not panoramic like i hoping it would . if you're looking enhancement you should get this , but if you're expecting too much you may better off buying newer digital camera	-1
i am trying my hands taking close-up pictures first time . i bought this lense without really knowing how it works because i thought it take better close-up pictures . indeed , it . not only i take nice clear picture but i take close up 6 " clarity . i tell ya , if you wanna try wide angle you new this want something cheap . get this , it worth your while . oh !! one problem i encounter seller : deliversy service not prompt i expected customer reviews . disappointed sense but truly happy product	-1
i've owned this camera over year now , i continually find myself reaching this one whenever i need know i get shot i want . i love quality color kodak prints , well ease use those us who closer " point shoot " type consumers . if i make numerous adjustments camera before shooting , i would never get pictures i want ... i'm usually taking pictures kids or animals , or scenery , or concerts i love able snap several photos while others still busy composing one shot . it consistent i rely end product very good , it overall better redeye than my 4 mp olympus . ( yes i lot cameras ! ) many years i used 35 mm canon ae1 everything still love quality you get those , but digital addictive . able delete retake pictures just invaluable . i disagree other reviewer video clips . i inadvertently shot some video concert ( it dark i turned wheel wrong setting ) it simply showed up photo software downloaded easily pictures . i click it it plays . i find software simple it could more features , but it adequate , especially considering price this camera , i don't rely solely kodak software editing , etc . i find battery life amazing .... i buy 1800 lithium batteries always carry extra , but rarely change one vacation . i just returned ireland , shooting 350 pix only changed it end trip .... awesome . i think one my favorite things this camera shutter lag ( or lack shutter lag ) , this baby ready go next shot time i am ... it one reasons i capture so many shots quickly , then sit back enjoy scenery not waiting camera ready again . my olympus terrible this regard . i say i can't recommend kodak z7590 same way ( i've owned it over year also ) , but review time . my first digital camera 2 mp kodak dx3440 still takes awesome pictures after dropped several times . this little camera portable goes into purse easily lightweight , perfect vacations or going concerts . i think it little gem . there lots more technically qualified reviewers here give you specifications details , but person who just likes grab camera use auto settings .... print up 8 10 my canon photo printer , it perfect . most my pictures turn out great , photo lab quality . ( i i860 canon printer)i one incident this camera ireland when it misting rain shutter failed open all way ... i got 3 beautiful but strange pictures edges shutter framing gorgeous green landscape , but it only momentary camera soon returned performing perfectly , i simply dried shutter , got out rain .... :) i hope this review helps someone . if you pro , or advanced photographer , you already something lot more sophisticated , but average person who just likes take good pictures , you can't beat this camera ! good luck !	1
this cover goes good case kit made d40 . i wish case little larger . i also wish they made more custom cover you could leave camera use	-1
i travelling europe via japan , singapore , australia new zealand usa . anyhow they handling my luggage so badly they broke one those flights my charger ( possibly somewhere security ) . i tried several shops houston buy replacement including sonystyle shop . no luck all . went back hotel , look amazon.com, ordered it it two days later delivered my room . that perfect service .	1
product compact portable , seems solid well made . zoom good , functions all fairly simple . hooks up tv easily enough . nigh vision feature , while providing better visibility , creates more strobing effect than i would liked . also , i not yet figured out how transfer video computer ( i right cable ) , but i haven't tried too hard figure it out	-1
i like this camcorder because it small , lightweight travels easily . neat little feature- you take snapshots while recording video . i'm very happy optical zoom . only downfall- no separate charger battery so camera plugged charge it , which very limiting . upside- it charges quickly .	-1
there isn't much more say here . this superb little camera , definately worth 10 cnet , not 7.0 their review gave it ! they completely got it wrong their rating because this camera definitely deserves least 8.0 ! here , it also gets my 5 stars ! far pros go this camera ( 28mm wide angle , 10x optical zoom , 3 '' lcd , , built-in lens cover ) , it exactly good it sounds ! real life needs real life situations real people loves superb photos right camera capture those moments . cons side ( no manual controls , no zoom video mode , average battery life ) , those practically only things more advanced user would care . manual controls mostly expert photographers white balance exposure settings already this camera , so i don't know what else you need . zooming video mode isn't important me since i don't particularly take much video footage . i only say average battery life because i tend look through photos i already shot pretty often without using power save lcd , therefore , that particularly what drains battery . however , you usually get @ 250-270 shots per charge , without frequent previewing . panasonic basically taken original tz1 made it even better . there not much missing this camera . i've said , 28mm wide angle leica lens , 10x optical zoom , 3 " high resolution screen , excellent image stabilization , etc . all this fairly compact camera . panasonic also improved " noise " higher iso . low light performance much better than previous panasonic models . most important this , camera takes fantastic pictures . thing i'm extremely impressed construction finish alone . just holding it your hands it screams quality feels like tank . i love it . it seriously feels like $700 camera . no exaggeration . i little worried it not able fit my jean pockets before buying it . women may issues really tight jeans but us guys no problem . it fits fine . i seriously can't believe i carry around camera 10x zoom inside my jean pockets . truly remarkable . 3 " screen amazing . you practically enjoy your pics right screen without even printing them high resolution output . image quality great , if you need extra sharpness want " canon-like look , " you could always use camera " vivid mode . " it also not much bigger or heavier than your overpriced sony . plus , here , i found it three hundred , high speed 1gb panasonic card included . what better than ?! only accessory i buy now just dmw-ct3-k , leather case specifically this camera . you really can't find perfect digital camera , but this comes close you get . overall , i am extremely pleased . if you looking great zoom camera small enough form factor , you should seriously consider dmc-tz3 . this best compact camera i've ever owned	1
i came off canon powershot s40 , little 4-megapixel brick camera gave me 4 years excellent results . my first digital camera after closet-full film nikons . many buffs claim 4 megapixels all you need , i made number nice looking a3 prints . now i 7 megapixels work , i see i wrong : four not enough . seven wonderful . [ ... ] points out strongly above iso 200 noise real problem -- but you always wonder just how picky they . well not too picky this case . using higher than 200 setting ( i.e. , most indoor flash shots ) resulted lot noise , making camera almost unusable except simplest 4 6 snapshots . but i take almost entirely outdoor shots -- scenics candids . i set iso 100 get gorgeous results . it taken some getting used different color rendition tz3 my canon . canon seems more balanced while tz3 caused reddish orange really pop out . there something cool ( color temperature-wise , not " fashionable " ) color not entirely fixed photoshop . sometimes results marvelous , especially shots cloudy or rainy days . other times they not so grea t--t o desaturated my taste . so i playing around various settings --" natural " " vivid . " " vivid " closer what i want right out camera , but less easy spruce up . " natural " easier modify , so setting i am using now . i also set exposure compensation one stop under . i pleasantly surprised how small tz3 : it slips easily into pants pocket ( but not shirt pocket ) . zoom lens starting decent wide-angle ( 28mm ) utterly fantastic really makes camera stand out head shoulders pack . thus , i am delighted choice . however , answer my question " what more could i want ? " , here it : 1 . selection disk always moves when i pocket camera , so i always check , when i pull it out , reset it desired setting . its detents need strengthened . 2 . back-side controls too easy activate accidentally when shooting one-handed fleshy part thumb . headache because you then need press " select " get back operation . 3 . dpreview right when they moan venus iii sensor . it good but , otherwise sensational camera like this one , not good enough	-1

while i like this lens , when zoomed all way out i see edge lens through camera big blacked out circle around outside edge video . i'm sure larger lens would help , but i think it good compromise due its weight which isn't bad some say , it balances camera larger battery pack quite well	-1

this uv filter it job protect lens well . build solid ( metal construction ) . glass also descent quality . performance , it absorbs some uv light . uv light absorbtion hardly noticeable , probably sky 1-a haze filter version absorb more uv light than this lens which fine me . now , one problem which internal reflection . i've heard many people say it mostly happens during night or low light shooting . i found out it not caused directly low light/night situation . internal reflection appear when there strong/bright source light comparison overall exposure ( surrounding environment ) . put it example ( which hopefully easier understand ) , when you take picture lamp during nightime light much brighter than surrounding area then you see internal reflection . you move position light closer sides/corner picture ( not center picture ) , internal reflection reduces finally dissapear ( if you move light far enough center ) . if light isn't too bright/contrast compare surrounding environment then there no internal reflection . but course most time , lamp nightime often very bright . but point i'm trying make internal reflection doesn't happen all time during low light or night time . additionally , internal reflection isn't only happening night . it also happen afternoon if you taking picture sun example . basically same rule above , how bright light source compared surrounding area , you move sun center photo near side internal reflection move side/dissapear ( also depending angle ) . but best way just remove filter during these situations . hope this explanation helps you reduce occurence internal reflection identifying correctly when internal reflection occur then remove filter during those situation ( which not hard ) . i'm actually not fan lens filter ( any filter ) i think it only degrade picture quality we added layer sensor object , but i decided use them anyway all my lens . i would recommend everyone get one this filter if you don't any filter your lens yet .	-1
this item best resolution market today , wood grain frame looks great . functionality good simple once you get used it . capabilities usb memory card very versatile . out box , i up running under 15 minutes . my only complaint frame doesn't autorotate , but it great it it own hard drive you save photos too . if you drop $200 , it great digital photo frame .	-1
this surprisingly very good camera . though it 4mp camera , picture quality so much better than other 5 or 6mp cameras . we chance comparison when we ( group friends ) took lot pictures park using different types cameras . pics dsc-s60 so much brighter clearer . i guess only problem dsc-s60 it quite bulky ( compared similar models ) . it could quite pain carrying this around whole day .	-1
i purchased this camcorder lot hesitancy because reviews it received here amazon , but price i got it , it hard refuse . first , camera very lightweight sturdy construction . if handled delicately , i don't foresee any spontaneous operational issues appearing . if you drop it kick it around , then sure , it going break not function correctly . i am very pleased quality film it produced . i am amateur photographer videographer , i no complaints personally this particular model . it functions well all light , i especially impressed how it low-light . i found reading manual thoroughly understanding cameras functions helped me immensely avoid problems . overall , i am pleased it am glad i chose it . i full faith this camera , why it going used alaskan cruise , film my wedding this summer . it great camera price . now , i couple rants it . - when specialized mode while filming , display very slow . so i haven't able " real time filming " when i am shooting something , i see it on-screen , it already happened something else going . - camera not come any extras , which meant we run store get mini dv tapes required start using it immediately . - biggest issue actually caused me lot frustration anger this camera you cannot transfer your film your computer through usb . my other cameras , i always able transfer all digital images ( movies stills ) over usb . not this . you special cable ( firewire 4 pin 4 pin ) you port it your computer . most average computer users not this port ( i new dell dimension ) so , i go buy firewire port ( $14.99 ) , open my computer case physically install hardware . firewire cable itself really inexpensive . someone who doesn't know computers needs this port , it could honestly cost you quite bit it installed you . it turns into lot hassel , which isn't very appealing todays technological consumer . overall , i rate it good camera money , but i not like issue firewire cable .	-1

this very well thought out product - you get all pro features you need very small affordable package . it full ttl flash nikon cameras - meaning camera meter scene adjust flash timing power match what you shooting , all automatically . such , it very hard take one those terrible , washed out flash pictures . flash unit itself mounted so it easily tilted flash bouncing give warmer lighting effect off ceiling - way it put together means it still very compact . very clever . fact , unit so small it easy carry you just case you need it . finally , you get nikon quality - build very good , it supplied nice padded case . all this little more than price generic flash unit camera store !	1

if you need small flash lot more powerful than on-camera flash your compatible nikon camera , this great flash . more than anything , it better than on-camera flash also bounce capability , which none on-camera flashes . me , it doesn't replace full-featured flash like sb-800 or sb-600 , but lot smaller lighter many times when you don't need big mama . it not powerful enough instance bounce if ceiling higher than 10 or 11 feet lower iso settings , where sb-800 still reach . i found i don't use it often i thought i would , but that really because i've not gotten into habit using fill-flash much i should . that not fault flash . it fully automatic , which really means there nothing set or control this unit . if your camera isn't compatible , basically this flash won't work you . if it compatible , it works great seamlessly . i use it d200 , d70 cp8400 , it works great all them . one thing keep mind if you thinking using it " better " main flash instance d200 wireless remote flash mode , think again . only actual in-camera flash used remote commander mode d200 . , this unit not capable remote flash wireless flash , either . so basically , don't consider it part wireless remote flash operation . it better than in-camera flash , not wireless flash . also keep mind far i know coolpix line only 8400 8800 fully compatible this . most newer dslrs , though . if your camera isn't i-ttl , it not flash you . check compatibility before you buy . if you want small fully integrated flash your nikon digital , it great unit .	1

i received my dsc-t100 sony cybershot 2 weeks ago . it wonderful camera . i'm not professional photographer any means . i found myself tired lugging around larger camera everytime we went vacation ( found i didn't really use one much when we weren't vacation ) . not using my camera very often , course , i forgot most it features . my pictures generally reflected . i really wanted camera i could me all time use more often . this sony cybershot fit bill exactly !!! i ordered small camera holder than i thread onto my belt . i carry my camera me every day now . i've gotten so many pictures since i've carrying it . it so easy just open start taking pics . it ready instantly takes terrific pictures . top , i'm actually able use features camera since i'm using it more often . i'm also taking video it finding it very simple takes great video . i suppose time tell how well built it carrying it around me every day . it feels very solid . smaller camera , i'm learn where place ( or more appropriately not place my hands ) when taking pics . i've gotten my finger pic time or two not paying attention . but that just matter getting used it . i'm really looking forward while traveling not lug around camera all necessary equipment it . battery lasted wonderfully . it really hold it charge well ( advertised ) . i went ahead bit bullet put 4 gig stick it make sure plenty room . it amazing !!! i've taken many pics lot video still huge amount space left stick . wow !!! this wonderful !!! i truly feel i made right choice this . i've taken pics restaurants , rest stops interstate , grave site my dad , video beach , etc . this camera really trick . i see i using it all time ( again , assuming it lasts well ... time tell )	1

i've used my 750 month now love it except one thing . no viewfinder . most ultra compacts don't one but bright sun it tricky see display . i " reshopped " today found canon elph 800si but - it only 3x optical zoom not 5x , it weighed more , cost $100 more , fewer features scenes ( which i really use ) , wasn't weather resistant harder " figure out " . i decided keep my 750 just learn how shield display better . it takes great shots automatic scenes easy use easy switch among . much easier than my old olympus	-1

i got this camera replace olympus c4000 too slow focusing bulky my needs ( shooting my toddler ) . i it 9 months now still think its great . one reason i bought it price ( under $200 ) reviews i saw web ( like dpreview.com ) . it small enough go your pocket . it used rain without fear damage . fireworks shots i took , couple seen user images this camera , where unexpectedly good handheld without tripod using fireworks program ! there couple cons , but minor expected camera this type , ie . weak indoor flash ( fix software ) , sometimes takes long low light focus , no lens protection . but all , would buy recommend again . make sure you invest nimh batteries charger you all set ! happy shooting	-1

i'm kind gadget nut i guess , so i all stuff go my canon a95 camera , including 0.7 1.75 conversion lenses canon , . 45x 3.2 conversion lenses opteka . 2 opteka lenses ( bought together ) i got only one bundled aluminum adaptor yet company ( not one shown opteka page ) . although i like aluminum because it matches camera , it not mate camera very well , some rotational slop general wobbliness . canon adaptor made hard type plastic commonly found 35mm slr lenses , so it pretty sturdy . further , when it clicks place camera , there no movement all - very secure . so ... plastic works , or nice aluminum which questionable ? well , i'm going use aluminum one strictly hold filters , i bought 2 more canon ones ( makes 3 ) lenses . i plan leave them attached 2 lenses because i hate screwing lens off .	-1
even though i not used this item yet , knowing kodak their standards i know it great finest quality .	1
i find this product amazing . i never able successfully use binoculars because my hands too unsteady . press button ,, all shaking stops i enjoy though looking through window . i find binoculars reasonably light feel natural sit comfortably my grip . lots good technology reasonable price . my only criticism neck strap . it appears impossible attach binoculars . it finally took my wife i three safety pins two pairs pliers four hands accomplish task simply attaching strap . it amazed us how thoughtless they this part design when they performing miracle stopping my hands causing image shake . now it attached i safely use binoculars without fear dropping them , it love product .	-1

this my 2nd digtial slr . film days , i using nikon products . my initial foray into digital photography , i switched canon ( 10d ) just see what other side fence . after three years , i switched back nikon because nikon products suits me better . no , this not " canon sucks , nikon rules " review . one thing i learned digital photography you should really decide not camera body itself , but whole lineup ... including lenses accessories . me , nikon lens line-up works me better , not because canon worse line-up ... i'm sure lot photographers find canon line-up much more sensible . now , camera itself : i've own this camera over year sold number stock images using this camera . suffice say , i'm very satisfied its performance ; i'm not going re-iterate praises that said previous reviews . what i am compelled say not-so-great characteristics this camera : iso400 above , it not very forgiving underexposure . if you not nail exposure , even raw you see noise shadow area when you try correct exposure raw software converter . this why you hear lot whining d200 owners regarding " noise . " most them don't nail exposure first time try adjust raw converter ... then bam ! noise shadows . auto white balance becomes iffy well underexposure ; everything becomes biased magenta underexposure ; this very hard correct even post-processing . nikon creative lighting system i believe feature makes nikon little better than canon artificial lighting exposure . basically , nikon designed their flash system multiple flashes mind . nikon auto-focus engine better than most canon folks tend evangelize . afs lenses i'm positive it fast any canons . if there one thing i would like change future iterations this product : i need more than one cross-type af points ! newer pentax dslr nine out its 11 af points ! this beneficial more accurate focus . so my recommendation ... if you already nikon lenses , thinking if it worth price difference jump d40/d50/d70 . it unequivocably " yes . " if you're just starting dslr system , i say look closely what nikon/canon/pentax/olympus/leica/sigma offer whole system then decide . if you decide nikon , you won't yearning own higher d2-series model this camera ; it almost same feature set lower price	1
nikon always leader photography/ camera/ lenses . others nobly tried but nikon remains high bar others only hope reach . when shift film digital began , there some speculation if nikon could keep up competition . well , rest assure not only they kept up , they continue lead way . latest example this d200 . like d70/ d80 - this solid piece equipment . just feel it tells you you holding excellent piece technology . but proof always end results again , combination nikon know-how nikon lenses lead even beginner come up excellent pictures . gone " lag shots " . you fire up shoot multiple pictures seconds so action shots all yours . without even " tweaking " picture computer program , you print top line photos home . people cited cons : expensive . yes . camera come hefty price tag but it should kept mind this piece machinery intended serious photographers . if you " vacation holiday " picture taker , then you should elect buy cheaper camera . same true difficulty multitude small buttons , dials switches . there too many they overwhelming but only someone who " point shoot " school picture taking . anyone else relish options nikon provided us d200 . room improvement ? well , battery life nowhere near good d70 which i upgraded but weak complaint you still get hundreds shots one charge . also , it would boon if flash would automatically pop up when needed like former models . so if you serious photography always one ready , this one you	1
while i am nowhere close pro , i am not stranger photography or digitals . recently i wanted something better than what i upcoming trip italy i bought lumix dmc-lx2 amazon after reading reviews , etc . it no slr , but it far more than " back-up " camera . it small enough handy without burden . ( friend we travelling digital slr 135mm zoom . she it her bag most time because it so big heavy . ) lens quality very good . absence traditional view finder very nice . tv screen back works all lighting conditions ( its adjustable ) . you little or lot technical data screen you want . it even couple nice composition templates i found useful times . i bought one after market batteries couple 2 gig cards i far more capacity than i needed 2 week trip , but second card necessary if you shoot max pixels i whole time . max jpg 2 gig card holds 350 shots . one battery all i needed so long i watched charger carefully night . sometimes current converter one use italy would shut down mid-charge . so my advice second battery switch them ou t.t his camera very versatile . it lot if one takes time study manual . ( manual not best , however ) slr beat out its zoom , but not much problem casual shooting because one crop tar out 10.1 mg shots still great photo . flash works fine . one fill flash it . i bought small slave unit works great but i never needed it . i found handy , cheap , case rei . they padded cell phone case hooks up belt or back pack . this camera fits rei case perfectly . it even side mesh pockets batteries chips . i forget price but i think it less than 20 bucks .	1
least now it :-) . during course past 10-12 months i owned 7 , that seven , digital cameras : canon s230 ; kodak v530 ; 5 different models casio's: z60 , z600 , z850 , p700 ; most recently presented my wife red s770 valentine day . i also pretty good chance evaluate canon sd450 ( my brother-in-law owns one - it actually gift my wife i him his 21st birthday ) , casio ex-s600 ( good friend mine owns one ) , panasonic dmc-tz1 ( once again , gift my wife i my father-in-law his last birthday ) . if you read any my digital camera reviews ( i've written few now ) , then you know i'm not particularly fond canon lately - i think they overrated overpriced what they offer . i also mentioned before , i've tried several different kodak models ( i used work company too ! ) , but all them turned out waste my time , say least . i became big fan casio , although not all my experiences them great . but huge gadget " freak " i am , constantly wanting new " toys " , i always craved more . over time , my tastes digital cameras changed simple point shoot type camera wishing more power manual control . so one one , i returned/sold all my cameras , after extensive ( i really mean extensive ) research , i got myself lx2 . i must say though i probably wouldn't without getting know my father-in-law tz1 first . i actually quite impressed it . powerful zoom , sharp lens , decent picture quality . i also played some other panasonic models various stores just get better feel them , well spent few hours phone , exchanged numerous e-mails friend mine who owns fz30 , who swears it . unfortunately , lx2 not available anywhere locally , but i felt i got pretty good understanding what panasonic cameras all , after some more thought consideration , i went ahead bought it amazon ( nice thing buying amazon you always return whatever it you bought , including digital cameras , within 30 days full refund , no questions asked ) . i know " noise " issue high iso , but it wasn't decisive factor me , i'm glad i didn't pay much attention it got camera anyway . it turned out one best purchases i've made long while . here why : pros : - superb design . this camera wonderfully crafted . i absolutely love black ! it gives camera nice , clean , professional look . i don't think i'll buying silver camera soon after this one ; - intuitive controls , menus . i charged battery , put it into camera , started using it taking pictures right away , without even going through manual once ; - load features , including large , bright , widescreen lcd ; wide angle , super sharp leica lens 4x zoom ; mega ois - optical image stabilization control ( optical means it mechanically , which true way doing stabilizing , comparing other cameras where it " tricking " camera into using higher iso ); many more . addition , it joystick easy access different menus , number manual controls , well provides ability shoot raw format ( more later ); - it comes silkypix developer studio software working camera raw files . someone who not familiar raw - it " pure " , camera specific picture format . it varies upon manufacturer , meaning canon raw different nikon or panasonic raw , example . it " pure " sense it much better quality than standard jpeg ( jpg ) , doesn't suffer loss information , such white balance , or brightness . there lot more raw than , i'm not going go into details right now . what i want say , however , previously owned camera which supported raw format ( casio ex-p700 ) , i must tried dozen different raw editing software packages , including products adobe , ulead , arcsoft , photofiltre , picture window pro , acdsee , lightzone , image broadway , more . silkypix delivered far best results all . only one i would probably put next it bibble ; - noise - what noise ?! i really hate it when i hear people complaining noise this camera ( after it tried myself ) , or any other compact digital camera matter . you really na�ve you think you get absolutely no noise your images using compact digital camera ? think again . you might noticed i've used word " compact " several times here . i've it purpose - it inevitable compact digital camera produce some noise . some cameras better than others , but no matter how hard you try , you see some . this camera no better or worse than any other one i've had/tried . higher iso ( above 400 ) , it slightly more visible , but who right state mind using anything over iso 200 compact digital camera , such this one , anyway ? i always mine set 100 . if i feel it doesn't get job , i shoot raw ; - picture quality very good . yes , it take some time getting used , but once you familiarize yourself everything this camera capable , you achieve spectacular results , especially if you don't mind doing some post processing . much i like everything this camera offer , there , however , some things kind irritate me . here short list bad things this camera , otherwise known ascons : - first all , this camera actually somewhat misrepresented . it advertised 10.2 megapixel camera , which not entirely true . 10.2 mp resolution available only 16:9 ( wide ) aspect ratio . two more ratios available - 3:2 , more conventional 4:3 , but those offer 8.5 , 7.5 mp resolutions respectively . so if you compare this camera others don't widescreen format , or if you prefer shoot only regular 4:3 mode , then this camera should only referred 7 mp digital camera ( because not all pixels actually effective ) . obviously , panasonic aware it , marketed it higher pixel count purpose , boost consumer interest ; - i expected see compact digital camera . what i got instead actually smaller compact camera than i expected . i really surprised see how small , yet convenient hold operate , camera body . what i didn't like , however , lens . not lens itself , it actually quite superb , but fact it sticks out . i like cameras lenses retract all way back camera body . i realize it would probably loose some features , like wide angle , perhaps zoom , but i still wish it . it would so much more ... umm ... compact ?! way it actually makes it quite difficult find right case it . almost impossible , i should say . i've tried few , but they either too small or too big . i just can't find one would fit right . i put order slx1b case it , which specifically designed fit lx1 , lx2 models , but i hear they not good . we shall see ; - i'm not big fan pop-up flash . i always keep forgetting open it when i need use it . it also seems bit flimsy . i'm treating it carefully i , but i just can't stop thinking it might break soon ; - i hate lens cap !!! there , i said it . it probably just one those small annoyances keep frustrating you until you get used it , but now i'm not really happy it . summary :d espite very few minor negatives , i think lx2 probably one best , most innovative cameras market today , i sure am glad one . it offers more than any other camera same price range , even compete some dslr when it comes picture quality . if you someone like me , who wants more control and/or learn more digital photography , or dslr user who just needs solid backup carry everywhere , then this camera not overlooked ! highly recommended	-1
i chose this camera specifically because advertised in-camera red-eye reduction fix . i new baby like any proud parent , take loads photos him . it pain fix red-eye manually photoshop , but same time i don't want lug around ( or learn how use ) slr type camera . i thought coolpix s9 would solution my problems . while photos very crisp clear , red-eye worse than my old casio digital camera flash really washes out indoor photos taken night . fact flash so bright it makes my son turn away camera , so pictures didn't red-eye all back his head ! i returned this camera am renewing my search something meet my needs	-1
we purchased panasonic vdr-d100 our first video camera after birth our daughter . we wanted ability record directly dvd , playback our dvd player able edit our computer . just last reviewer stated ; getting dvd-rw discs recognize our computer main problem . we wanted able this so we could simple editing functions like dividing combining camera , but then embellish little transition shots cleaning up video our computer . we also wanted upload video through youtube online our blog . after little research working csrs panasonic , we able figure out we needed 1 ) driver 2 ) authoring software 3 ) software recognize play dvd-rw our computer . less than $20 ( including shipping ) panasonic sent us dvd-movie album se 4.2 , which included driver ( reads dvd-rw , but no editing allowed ) dvdfunstudio 2.4 ( authoring software , which allows editing ) . after tinkering it hour i realized manuals ( pdf program ) not very easy understand novice like myself , so i opted forego authoring software microsoft moviemaker . i needed dvd-movie album se 4.2 though regardless able recognize dvd my computer . less than $20 -- wasn't bad all . my review editing focused because major downfall camera . i wanted share how we got around downfall how pleased we result . i created my first edited video our daughter able save it my computer , upload it through youtube our blog , then save it regular dvd ( get it off our computer ) re-use dvd-rw disc save us little cash . i don't know enough video cameras tell anyone if it good or not , really . it inexpensive it well my shaky abilities , so we very pleased . it decent mic fair low lighting situations .	1
i would not necessarily agree previous reviewer assessment it lightweight . i guess it relative , but three lenses i own my d80 it heaviest ; although not so much it hassle carry . i found this lens great lot different situations landscapes portraits . one thing though , heed manual , scott kelby book , advice turn vr off when shooting this lens tripod . one thing note , this lens hard come vendors who some stock charging premium over msrp . you decide if premium worth it ( i decided it ) or if you want get it up $200 cheaper waiting several weeks months . eventually nikon get enough into marketplace , but they aren't there yet	1
half price i could find local store . two quick release units . seems great product	1
these binocs very similar ones they replaced cost 5x much . old ones got tossed because they showing double image after living my backpack 2 years or so . bushnells may or may not quality optics more expensive units but " permafocus " or infinite depth focus makes it so you just pick them up look . if what you looking further than 75 ' away it clear . this really great when multiple users using them you don't reconfigure them each persons eyes . it also good scanning wide area you don't adjust focus close or far . this also makes them great watching sports where things move fast . i decided try these because we some older 10x50 units use same " permafocus " design under different brand got bought bushnell they working great over 10 years . i hope i able say same these .	-1
i really like perma-focus attribute this product . we use it nature watching while hiking vacationing . it good able pass binoculars back forth others without losing subject while adjusting focus each time . only drawback difficulty holding binoculars steady when viewing due magnification . best binoculars we've	1
i actually purchased 2 these christmas presents . i gave one pair my son " early christmas " gathering my husband so enthused quality , i ordered pair him .... received them before christmas ! per my husband : " very good quality ... compact so they take up very little room glove box my car !	1
used this trip hawaii - brought lava much closer ( looked great night ) . it not difficult focus , provides clear images . i not disappointed least . compact size makes it pocketable - perfect any traveler/casual user . recommende	-1
this my first telescope . i looking inexpensive one , but i didn't want cheap toy . i researched every telescope i could find under $250 category bought this one based reviews amazon , which appear given this telescope highest rating its price range . i'm very satisfied it . no complaints . telescope appears well built impressive features price , most notably parabolic mirror . it small enough easily portable easily set up table or milk crate . all you attach finder scope it ready use right out box . mine needed no adjustments . red dot finder scope makes aiming telescope simple . one more difficult aspects shopping telescope trying determine just what image would look like actual use . never used one before , specifications comparisons little use me , so i'll try describe what you expect see starblast : smaller magnification eyepiece shows moon sharp detail , you clearly see craters surface features . when you look moon telescope , its features seem three-dimensional compared any photographs you may familiar . larger magnification eyepiece , moon image more than fills field view , you see individual surface details . however , this larger magnification more suitable viewing more distant objects . example , while looking orion , i clearly saw what appeared cloud surrounding one stars . little research i determined i found great orion nebula . cool ! this why i bought telescope - see things i would never known looking around pair binoculars	1
i agree all previous reviews . i've owned number telescopes . all honesty , i never planned getting this scope , but i changed my mind first time i looked through one star party . some reviews mentioned this little guy isn't really designed high power views . however it decent enough job it 6mm eyepiece ( 75x ) which lets you see saturn rings . where this scope shines wide field objects like pleiades , which too big seen normal telescope . i believe previous reviewer mentioned jerky motion when turning telescope . i able minimize this taking lazy susan type base apart spraying pledge furniture polish laminate surface lessen friction . biggest " con " this scope it needs set top table order get eyepiece up comfortable height . however this telescope still blows away anything i've seen costco , wallmart , etc . one thing you should aware you really go somewhere pretty dark away all lighting this any other telescope achieve it best views . ideally somewhere out country far away possible street lighting let you enjoy much better views	1
this my 2nd digtial slr . film days , i using nikon products . my initial foray into digital photography , i switched canon ( 10d ) just see what other side fence . after three years , i switched back nikon because nikon products suits me better . no , this not " canon sucks , nikon rules " review . one thing i learned digital photography you should really decide not camera body itself , but whole lineup ... including lenses accessories . me , nikon lens line-up works me better , not because canon worse line-up ... i'm sure lot photographers find canon line-up much more sensible . now , camera itself : i've own this camera over year sold number stock images using this camera . suffice say , i'm very satisfied its performance ; i'm not going re-iterate praises that said previous reviews . what i am compelled say not-so-great characteristics this camera : iso400 above , it not very forgiving underexposure . if you not nail exposure , even raw you see noise shadow area when you try correct exposure raw software converter . this why you hear lot whining d200 owners regarding " noise . " most them don't nail exposure first time try adjust raw converter ... then bam ! noise shadows . auto white balance becomes iffy well underexposure ; everything becomes biased magenta underexposure ; this very hard correct even post-processing . nikon creative lighting system i believe feature makes nikon little better than canon artificial lighting exposure . basically , nikon designed their flash system multiple flashes mind . nikon auto-focus engine better than most canon folks tend evangelize . afs lenses i'm positive it fast any canons . if there one thing i would like change future iterations this product : i need more than one cross-type af points ! newer pentax dslr nine out its 11 af points ! this beneficial more accurate focus . so my recommendation ... if you already nikon lenses , thinking if it worth price difference jump d40/d50/d70 . it unequivocably " yes . " if you're just starting dslr system , i say look closely what nikon/canon/pentax/olympus/leica/sigma offer whole system then decide . if you decide nikon , you won't yearning own higher d2-series model this camera ; it almost same feature set lower price	1
ergonomics : perfect . d200 not completely rubber-encased . there rubber where your hands need hold it , plastic where your hands rarely touch it . hand grip comfortable nicely concave where tips your fingers dig . battery door memory card door made plastic , hinge-pinned . simple slide latch opens battery door .... some warned latch could easily ( accidentally ) tripped . memory card door latch , however , uses more secure 45 degree pivoting latch . usb 2 video out/dc-in doors made flexible rubber , these doors extend into body camera hinges themselves . english language operating manual work art . each operating concept alpha ' numerically numbered pictoral diagram , page where function explained perfect english . reader quickly catch how this well thought out manual organized . i like depth field preview , mirror lock-up , multiple-exposure capability . continuous servo autofocus better job than any human following focusing any moving object . if you old manual-focus , film-based nikon slr lenses ' 70 ' 80 , except few rare exceptions , fit d200 . all these positive attributes remind me best , most highly-evolved film camera slr . no wonder so many photographers won over digital media .	1
i think point lot people not mentioning d200 quite obvious . let me first say main reason i bought d200 over d80 increase my credibility prestige amateur photographer , make other photographers jealous my kit , brag obscene amount money i spend camera equipment while my co-workers can't even pay their rent . i bought grip because i thought it looked really cool , it increased size visibility my camera other people . question really sold me d200 : strangers i might want photograph more likely say yes standing other side d80 or d200 ? people less doubts me holding this thing opposed smaller model ? which one looks cooler ? if i completely loaded would i buy d2xs ? without second thought . course i talked lot camera people making minimum wage hoping they would some technical insight purchasing nikon or other camera . course they let me down said lot bogus things me most saying something like : " d200 way much camera me . " none them knew how change exposure settings , they contented wheel " child mode , " top d80 recited this me several times if i looked like soccer mom . usual i offended human experience buying real world , especially atrocious mark up several hundred dollars , i refused help pay those employees wages . breaking point i think time associate instructed me buy one camera over other because , " when she dropped this camera it broke other one didn't . " so i turned internet where i only say hi ups man he leaves . i studied studied all things technical , sometimes just staring pictures cameras long periods time without blinking . i poured over thousands photographs taken all kinds cameras amassed photographic library while i decided . basically i went way overboard let decision buying camera engulf my life until i dreaming it . so one night i just bought d200 after fence over d80 or d200 . after two days it arrived i impressed it . thing literally cold hard photographic machine . after broken d50 i firstly impressed size , then secondly all dials switches change things i used dig through menu get . thirdly i liked blazing fast 2 frame rate . when i go out night i snap 50mm f/ 1.8 onto it crank iso up . lot people forms complaining noise high iso d200 but i thought it fine . i feel most people camp want perfect clarity all way up into highest isos but i think artistically limiting . i read one scathing review written veteran film user saying basically high iso digital lot less graininess than film basically saying d200 step up but some people still want complain . far d200 goes versus d50 iso 1600 it leaps bounds better my opinion . noise way reduced without nr there isn't pixel chunkiness i found d50 high isos . thing stands out d200 enhanced colors . reality ultra vivid setting d200 makes lot things look sort fake , but it make people who don't sun tan look like they one which plus my opinion . it make your dull green lawn look like lush paradise , skies ultra blue , reds spectacular . i remember when i used d50 i would steer away photographing violets red roses because it would blow them out , not so d200 . some reason coming point shoot it always used annoy my d50 didn't bw or sepia . d200 bw but no sepia . nerds forums would just say , " use cs2 , or photo editor , " but i say no because i should able everything camera . viewfinder so awesome . i literally hated electronic viewfinders d50 viewfinder so small it hindered my framing times . d200 big bright viewfinder huge lcd sucks down batteries like nothing . far my evolution goes photography sometimes i feel like i literally climb into viewfinder because its so big compared what i used . like i said grip awesome i really like it . i kind like many accessories possible kind steered me away d2xs into d200 . watching percentage marks count down batteries drain always fun . best thing d200 little things like because they make me feel like i greater control over my pictures because i know exactly how many i take . conclusion buy d200 over d80 i am really happy it i am not happy anything . if you're trouble considering what you want photographically try pull yourself away forums outside sources really consider what got you into photography first place where you intend go it , i think important part . advertising gear collecting never made anyone better artist	1
this camera deserves 5 stars if you need camera easily fits your pocket or purse ready use whenever picture or movie moment arrives , even under water . considering varied picture taking situations , action , lighting conditions , performance beyond my expectations . only significant limitation seeing display bright sunlight or under water , even when screen set its brightest . however , aiming intuitive enough i never missed shot i able change modes even under water ( but i practice switching underwater wide 2 movie ahead time ) . one feature would improvement would ability zoom while taking movie . i received this camera just couple days before leaving cruise so i didn't any time practice it . careful not your finger front lens , especially under water where you may not watching screen . also aware when you zoom movies image movement also magnified . wide angle underwater movies much better than full optical zoom ( digital zoom off ) . after couple days controls easy use change modes review pictures movies . i used 1 gig cards highest resolution which provided 240 pictures or 40 minutes movies . switching back forth easy . movie recording continue until card full or battery runs out , not just short clips . my clips too short until i comfortable i would not quickly fill up memory card or run out battery . under water pictures superb natural shift color toward green . i recharged battery every other night . battery able take 100 pictures 15 minutes movie recharges . i recommend spare battery it indicate it getting low couple times ran out once . camera also used daylight , inside , without flash , even night shots ( auto setting better than night scene harbor lights night . camera steadied railing ) . i purchased lanyard metal clasp sports authority dollar which provides very secure leash . lanyard around my neck i could tuck camera my shirt pocket . i always ready next picture opportunity without worrying dropping it . i'm very pleased picture quality although it may not match camera much larger lens system , but it great able take pictures movies when i would not my larger camera available . 15 fps movies not match 3ccd digital video camera , but they acceptable . i even recorded short clips during live theater performances ( screen brightness set its minimum ) i pleased quality this tiny camera .	1
i olympus 770 sw ( not 720 sw ) , sure ... i like it . i five digital cameras before , this one terrific . considering it sub-compact pocket camera , image quality fine ( not equal digital slr , but i don't want carry around big box like dslr ) . shadow detail especially impressive . operation smooth intuitive . screen fine , even outdoors . shutter lag , big concern mine i like photograph my kids sports , minimal zero if you prefocus . number custom scene settings impressive . i bought it because waterproofing shockproofing , because prior good experience olympus over years , but i'm just happy pictures it takes under normal circumstances too . few gripes stop me giving camera 5 stars : 1 . battery cannot recharged when it camera . total $80 or so , you get external power source cable , together they let camera run long time without draining battery , but they don't charge battery . battery life fine day normal shooting , but if you use camera actively , every single night you pretty much unlock case , take out battery charge it , then remember put battery back next day . each charge takes 5 hours . i'm going take same $80 instead buy two extra batteries comfortable -- one camera , one reserve me , charging home . even so , it take some planning thinking keep batteries ready all time vacation . it would much nicer holster or charging socket case . 2 . case actually smaller than it needs . it could significantly bigger still fit my shirt pocket , which my standard size requirement . it , advanced engineering impressive pack all features tiny box , but camera more expensive than need , lens smaller than it should ( depending zoom position , lens f/ 3.5 f/ 5.0 , which pretty weak ) , it harder hold camera than need , if case bigger , there would room nice little charging socket too . 3 . there indeed background , almost mechanical noise introduced when filming videos . it probably filtered out , it very constant very low pitched , but it mildly annoying . 4 . time shots too long -- it takes several seconds save each shot full resolution . 5 . you use internal memory only if there no memory card slot . given slow transfer speed card , it sure would nice able save dozen or so shots very quickly internal memory then transfer them memory when you time . all , though , i'm really looking forward using this camera forthcoming sea kayaking snorkeling trip this summer . one camera , i'll able take snapshots above below water , also modest videos underwater ( there special scene selection just )	-1
i purchased this my kids grandma who doesn't or want digital camera but loves show off pictures . i currently use kodak software so i no trouble loading pics onto internal memory . trick tag your pics favorites then you need sync transfer them picture viewer . software recognized viewer right away . i it all loaded less than hour which included picking out pictures put it . usual kodak , screen crisp clear unlike other viewers , little larger than say magpix which i also considered . only draw back it cannot hooked tv not take regular batteries . overall , i very pleased most everyone who i showed it said - i want one . it perfect grandma throw her purse even comes leather case	-1
while i agree tutorial could better , instructions could easier , this still excellent product . far needing make pictures " favorites " before they transfer , manual * very * clear . anyway .... if you encounter problems loading pictures , all you copy paste them one your kodak albums into your viewer album . yes , moving pics 1 time pain , but it only worst-case scenario it works just fine . regarding viewer itself , i can't say enough nice things it : it small , but nicely-sized screen ( easily big enough view pictures ) , it zoom feature , nice carrying case so nothing gets scratched , it still easily fits into pocket ( certainly pocketbook ) . don't get me wrong ..... you shouldn't expect same kind quality you'd get looking standard 4x6 print photograph . but then , i would sincerely hope you didn't expect 2.5 inch screen . i bought one my father loaded it pictures before giving it him . i liked it so much , i then bought one my wife mother day !. one caveat ( me it small one ) , they advertise it hold 150 pictures . i wouldn't expect more than 100 . i found when i reduced resolution sufficiently 150 pics fit , photos looked pretty poor . but getting 100 no problem . i'm also willing admit this may simply my lack digital-photo expertise someone else * could * get more photos it . regardless , i still think it excellent value	1
this very nice tripod $15 plus shipping handling . i very pleasantly surprised . screwed into both my digital camera my camcorder . it folds up nice size very lightweight , but sturdy even when fully extended	1
i bought this camera trip down under couple month ago i really impressed image quality . it takes great low light pictures steady shot technology works really well longer shutter times . camera very small but feels solid hand due excellent construction unlike some casio ultra-compacts . well worth extra cost	1
haven't chance use it alot since purchasing it . still learning many features camera offers . although , bulkier than most smaller digital cameras , it easy handle but quality pictures capabilities camera more than make up size/weight . love it . most anything it .	1
i , like most people drawn this camera its incredible 28-420mm lens its 3.5 inch lcd screen . however i didnt like max aperture 8 . but i gave it chance anyways . first day i took it outside took few snapshots iso50 , which comes handy . iso50-400 fine me . basically this great camera but here some things people forget or ignore till its too late . -aperture max 8 . might too small more professional users . -write time raw 15 seconds tiff 25 . ( supported http://dpreview.com/reviews/samsungpro815/page4.asp )-tiff function not much better than jpeg it takes 25 seconds write . -works worse than most cameras dimly lighted areas(shutter speeds sink down 2.0 " 1/3 etc . ) . but you easily avoid this opening flash . overall this camera wonderful . it some problems but i find good outweighs bad landslide . just remember its 28-420mm zoom . think all possibilities . o yea it 3cm macro actually works well . props samsung camera well	1
if you like many videographers , you more than one battery . it easy start charging one , forget other . this baby charge two batteries time . or one if you like . i charged fp-960 clone fp-970 same time . sony says it ok though web info doesn't say it supported . infolithium batteries practically tell charger it , so it safe . naturally , charging two once takes twice long . if one battery finishes first , it trickle charges light goes out . thus allowing faster charging other battery . full charging hour after light goes out . i recall it max 1000ma so , there less chance over heating batteries during charging , thus minimizing damage . aside slower dual charge , there nothing bad i say it . folding plug prongs makes it very easy pack . it lacks car adaptor , but doesn't seem needed when you two fully charged batteries . no serious user info-lithium batteries should without it	1
would give 3.75 or 75% rating this new camera olympus . full review found [ ... ] overall camera feels good hold not seem all fragile . however , sp-550 too large purse or pocket use lacking features image quality would make it ideal dedicated camera intermediate advanced users . so target market hobbyists who avoiding advanced prosumer dslr models , yet wanting more features zoom than current crop shirt pocket cameras offer . photos not give sense crisp sharpness i hoping . noise issues , many which dealt post-processing , still abundant , may main contributer soft feel sp-550 images . all , i think image quality going sp-550 main downfall among serious photographers . contrary , strongest appeal casual photographers who simply take vacation family snapshots occasionally need longer zoom or wider lens . photographers who embrace sp-550 eventually want ability explore more advanced photography techniques find camera good stepping stone	-1
camers works well . takes great pics easy use lot extra features . great price . very pleased	-1
i lot research before buying my first digital camera . i wanted quality camera , i went back forth $300+ under $150 camera . i chose this one because i figured $140 , 5mp , 3x optical zoom , i would use it year then get new one not feel gipped . well , camera so great ! i knew nothing digital camera , instructions use language i'm not familiar , but camera very user friendly . it takes some tinkering , but it easy figure everything out . pictures come out crystal clear . different picture scene modes make some creative pictures . i travel lot , i love go out clubs bars , party moonlight dance till sun rises , i love outdoor indoor sports ... this camera light , small , i keep it my pocket , it takes great pictures . i mac computer , so cd didn't load .. but all you connect camera computer icon pops up . little copy paste , easy . battery life good . i like fact it used aa batteries , because when travelling overseas , it easy buy batteries , more difficult make sure you find outlet charge your camera . after 4 days using it continuously , battery still little over 1/2 full . i little concerned optical zoom , thought maybe i should invest camera more ... well , after taking picture house , i able zoom read words post-it note front door- 3x plenty ! i highly recommend this camera	1
i like this camcorder because 2 options no other camcorder . 1 . take pictures2 light front let you shoot night . i highly recommended buying this camera	-1
hp photosmart m527 all around well built camera , espicially considering price it purchased t.t he body all metal it honestly built like small tank . it feels good strong your hands . weight camera also very evenly balanced , so you hold it one hand get clear shots almost any situation . ergonomics overall design also help this . every button camera accessed just your one hand . screen very nice , bright , colorful , even lowest brightness setting . i really don't problem it " only " 2 " . i can't imagine situation where " small " screen would negatively impact ability accurately frame shot . image quality , price , also fantastic . shots little noisey . but honestly , how many cameras this price range not produce noisey pictures ? considering price , image quality great . sure , it doesn't look good canon costs extra hundred dollars . but doesn't mean image quality bad . noise disappears completely when you shrink picture down fit email . afterall , you're not emailing friends pictures 3.3 mb size each , you ? ;) when printed out , using photo printer or getting them professionally , prints very colorful good detail , definition , color saturation . they definitely able sit next all your other framed prints , or go photo album , only you ever know it digital print because nobody else able see difference quality . camera also offers multiple shooting modes help improve image quality certain situations . example , it " portrait " mode which help look closeups dramatically . it also obvious " night " mode which take care any dark or murky pictures low light . there " beach snow " mode which help you those high contrast shots bright lighting . it macro mode which obvious uses . you also manually adjust certain other parameters , such iso speed . however , you cannot adjust shutter speed or more advanced settings like . but if you find your pictures aren't exactly what you want them , there definitely modes help you get quality you desire . camera also decent movie mode . it record roughly 30 minutes slightly better than vhs quality video , sound , 512mb memory card . it not very good low light , but it good those quick moments when you out wish you video camera . however , you cannot zoom or out while recording . you adjust zoom before after recording . but not during . camera also very extensive photo editing features built-in , like famous " slimming " effect , you other things like add borders . it also very thorough help system . there only couple minor gripes i this camera . first battery life . real world battery life 100 shots two alkaline batteries . so get some rechargables or lithium batteries . second gripe memory card slot right there batteries . so little bit pain if you use memory card reader instead hooking camera up your computer transfer pictures . overall its great camera price , long you keep you realistic what expect . you're getting complete package not very much money . not many other cameras under $200 price range offer such complete package . if you're looking great camera cheap built well ton features , this definitely one look . however , if you want absolutely pristine image quality , you're better off looking $250+ canon powershot a6x0 series . me , this camera one built like tank get taken me everywhere i go . but i keep higher quality canon around those times when image quality more important than quick , yet good , shot	1

sr300 fantastic camcorder price still shots amazing . definitely worth buy . i am no professional . all i looking convenient camcorder easy use . i researched days torn ccd cmos , brands all other technical details features i probably never use . finally convenience not use tapes or dvd some technical specs lead me sr 300 . i love touchscreen operations . ease copy files over storage disks quickly conevnient ( offcourse , i wish i not use shoe ) . video quality great both indoors outdoors . however complete darkness , camera struggled focus ...... my eyes too .	1
10mm sigma versus 12mm nikon , it costs around half much . deal . hsm great focusing , works my d40 which only supports af-s type lenses . 5.6 narrow end unfortunate , but you don't buy this lens shoot 20mm . you handhold wide-angles slower shutter speeds anyways . lens cap once again sigma end-pinch , which i quickly replaced nikon center-pinch , practice i've begun all my sigmas . aware there optical distortions most wide-angle lenses , but most time they aren't much issue . when they , application like ptlens great job fixing it up . i've really become fan sigma lenses , they seem offer such great value . i'm sure nikon probably slightly sharper , but i don't see noticeable difference . i see difference 10mm 12mm , though , over $400 difference	1
set wonderful , but case so big it not confortable carried	-1
handling portrait shots ( vertical format ) improved . this because battery grip its own shutter button mode dials . battery grip d200 , camera size closely approximates nikon d2x . weight also understandably increases , but i think it helps keep camera steadier ; especially shaky hands when wind blowing hard . this battery grip ideal travel , because if you run out both batteries , you load up six aa batteries into grip keep making photographs . it well-made , sturdy accessory i highly recommend	1
very nice accessory d200 . doesn't add whole lot weight but it officially make d200 plus battery pack ... slightly taller than d2x , just slightly . this main sub control dials plus multi function button . must sports shooters people larger hands who want more space their pinky	1
i ordered this product through amazon recevied it promptly . product itself robust works very well . it however , very difficult get good focus . i usually get good service/product when ordereing amazon but this time i bit dissapointed . i ordered " new " unit not used one . product came opened box origianl product packaging missing . obviously used returned item . you would expect more when paying $276.00 item . i would returned it but it seemed work fine . i am happy product but unhappy amazon sending me used goods saying it new	-1

i really hedged sky caddie rangefinder . i've used both now convenience sky caddie hard beat constant readout yardage . however , given fact i often find myself " unique " locations any given course , there much said able shoot specific target get distance , which sky caddie doesn't allow you . sometimes you need odd distances lay ups , getting ball back play , etc . short , i would recommend this product . it easy use , appears very accurate . definite time saver course	-1
it light ; 6x magnification ; easy use . this little tool great any golfer . you must know yardage before you select correct club . how far it either top bunker next green or flagstick ? next , you just then need pull club get you there . fits your belt through loop safe carrying case or use supplied clip attached case your golf bag . these new laser rangefinders better than ever lower price than previous models . love it	1
while manual little vague how remove " o " ring used seal camera housing , i figured it out . not really hard . i applied gel . took it 45-50 feet 3-4 times it worked wonderfully perfectly . no leaks , no condensation , no brainer actually . it took great pictures . i would add messing digital camera when you're diving makes buoyancy especially interesting when trying close ups octopus tucked away reef . how set up canon nice underwater shoots definitely something take some time . but all means buy this . i diving 10 years this works great . recommended highly	1

i bought this amazon am thoroughly impressed . field view fine , you see ton detail within reasonable range . i turned out lights my room , looked out window it my pool ( 20 feet away ) saw ripples water . i aimed it up sky , saw line incoming airline traffic i couldn't see otherwise . i took it down basement -- pitch black -- used infrared illuminator could read text off boxes . taking it outside , i could see clearly houses across street , cars , dogs outside -- just ton stuff . remove gear my eye i see little nothing . thing beaut . my only concerns how long it last hold up . light damages this type technology if handled improperly , i'm hoping generally careful use no abuse keep this thing purring long time . power source convenient too --- two double aa all you need	1

i own nikon coolpix 3100 camera no complaints it , except fact its size ( even though it fairly small ) pain carry around when you want take pictures . looking much thinner camera , i came across this one quite pleasantly surprised its size , its ability take really great shots ! i'm merely birthday - holiday type picture taker , but this camera definitely enable me take more pictures , because i'll carrying it around my pockety whennever i go somewhere might provide photo opportunity .	1
works great , easy use store . it just what i need	1
i love my camera after year it my purse it gotten some pretty good scratches it . case small enough not take up too much space my purse , but its still not small enough fit snugly around my camera . it perfect long trips where i would need extra battery memory card case camera . still great buy smallest case i found this sized camera .	-1
just few notes using this camera after owned hp , olympus , sony digital camera . 1 . nikon no manual focus mode but autofocus not bad . if you lot low light work , camera infrared focus beam like sony better . infrared beam , camera focus total darkness . 2 . manual only mentions sd memory cards 1 gb but store let me try 2 gb , x60 card it worked almost doubling number photos increasing movie record time 30 minutes highest quality , 640x480 resolution , 30 frames/sec mode . my camera firmware version 1.0 so it likely all l6 use larger memory . one person reported it take 4 gb memory ( not sdhc type but plain sd ) . i cannot verify however . 3 . some reviewers here noted slow writing times memory but remember speed depends not only camera but speed memory . most sd cards no speed indicator write 1.5 mb/sec . high speed cards mentioned manual x66 ( means 66 times 150kb/sec ) which achieve write speeds 10 mb/sec . 4 . l6 zoom during movie mode but zoom digital not optical . also , you hear focusing mechanism noise soundtrack movie mode . 5 . batteries go dead most inopportune times , camera uses common aa plus . 6 . l6 only one metering mode unlike some cameras switch spot center weighted average . many scene modes make up this but one caveat . blur warning available non-scene mode not work scene mode . 7 . macro mode pleasant surprise . both my sony nikon focus same distance macro mode but there big difference results . sony achieves close distance wide angle mode . maximum zoom , sony requires moving camera back object . nikon opposite . it requires moving back ( not much sony ) wide angle it meets its close focusing distance specification maximum optical zoom . 8 . battery compartment . l6 locking latch battery compartment door door opens pulled out towards front camera . it may not seem like much unless you owned olympus which battery compartment door bottom no latch opened sliding long dimension camera . many times i would reach my pocket find door open batteries fallen out camera .	-1
i really don't too much add other reviewers , except i really fun using this camera . i've various digital cameras years ( mostly canon series ) but none come even close 3 " screen . you really see your composition . plus camera small fast ... so i keep it my shirt pocket pull it out get shot off quickly . i find screen gets smudged easily , but i just clean it more often ... i don't really mind extra work cleaning , i imagine it would like like washing your ferrari every sunday .	1
i much larger camera years but introduced canon sd630 friend . i fell love it instantly began looking one . during my search , i discovered sd750 released . so i waited . i just got it less than 24 hours ago i am not disappointed ! 3 inch lcd great ! it works well even sunny day . i admit getting my fingerprints all over it regularly driving me crazy but it cleans up easily lense cleaning cloth . camera takes dynamite pictures i love macro mode . camera fast too , much faster than my old four year old model . it starts up fast , shoots fast , stores fast . i shot some pictures dusk last night found camera well low light well . one thing worries me little flap covers usb connector . maybe it just me , but i feel like i am going break it . instead using usb cable , i go buy memory card reader download pictures . other than little detail , i love camera so far . i found menus reasonably intuitive , which i like . i don't care reading manual ( who ? ) most functions easy remember even if i only use them once while . this going great little camera me	1
i've c6 celestron some time . i wanted something easier move set up . this firstscope works great kids . easy set up very clear optics . price , you can't go wrong ! moon , venus saturn kids wanting see more !	1
only trouble this product it very hard pick up flag any distance . you generally use trap ( or person green ) get distance flag . otherwise , we've found this very useful easy use tool	-1
i don't know how i played golf before i bought this . what i thinking ??? no more adding or subtracting or just plain guessing . time group front walked off green , i exact yardage pin , right iron my hand ready fire . unfortunately , laser range finder doesn't help you hit greens any better , but i am pin high every time ! it so much fun	1
this 3rd digital camera i use , it really impressive . here highlights : -first off i loved video feature , you get decent 640x480 sound , since camera so small , you'll always able capture those special moments , it also comes usb cable connect pc cable connect camera t.v ( video audio out)-the rechargable lion battery also comes charger very nice feature , digital cameras notrious battery drainers , i separate budget batteries ( aa ) my former camera , those aint cheap ! - so you wont worry this this one . -it also voice recorder so you record notes when you taking still photos . negative sides : - you need buy separate sd memory because high resolution stills videos take lot memory , you'll need least 512mb , better yet go 1gb . -the special effects button back camera kinda useless , it turn pictures into monochrome , b/w . sepia etc . or negative , _ biggest negative thing i found it takes way too long actually capture picture even low res . flash goes twice red eye reduction ( very impressive results ) but whole process slooow , so you end up not taking shot you intended , i am still trying figure out how disable this feature so it takes photos faster . this may only real negative feature this camera .	-1
price size i am very pleased digimax l6	-1
pirate scope works advertised . " leather " fake or low quality stitching not great . optics good , extras weak . shipping good too . seller delivered advertise	-1
my brother bought this frame his wife 2 months ago . he liked it so much he suggested we get one our parents anniversary . so he it shipped my home because i'm family historian most pictures my folks would want . i selected 2900+ pictures converted them 640x480 . all 2900+ pics plus 15 glenn miller songs fit 512mb sd card 50mb still vacant . i liked frame so much i just bought one my wifes birthday . really good looking ; both actual frame images . i'm fairly serious digital photgrapher i didn't think 640x480 resolution could look this good . looks much better than i expected . sounds just ok , but what you'd expect size speakers fit something this size	1
easy set up , looks nice much brighter than 8 " kodak frame target	1
it fits camera perfectly . it really cute not bulky . it not just ordinary camera case everyone else . it classy .	1
this case saved my ** my camera ! i drop my new camera but thankfully it case -- you could cushion when it hit floor -- thankfully !! i clip camera my belt away we go . its awesome -- so v550 camera !	1
i seen other lenses sold quite bit less , but decided against attaching cheapo lens camera i spent lot money - me anyway , since i'm beginner . kodak well worth investment , pictures look fabulous . it not massive amount magnification , but my understanding anything more than 1.5 pretty much useless due picture distortion . i'm attaching pair pictures . both lens , but i included first give idea distance i shooting . i used monopod both . like uren noted previous review , this quite large piece gear when attached kodak adaptor . plan picking up larger case camera , adaptor , lens . tripod or monopod also recomended , any shakiness your hand also magnified higher zoom	1
my brother delighted his lens you got it here before christmas which made me very happy	1
lens worked wonderfully my kodak z740 camera not problem . i wanted light camera better pixel shoot small music festival events , however obtaining lenses become problem . i found this lense it worked beautifully no problem whatsoever . it little weighty lense you definitely need supplemental flash especially night shoots , but during day , close-ups brilliant	-1
jvc gr-sxm38us super vhs camcorder great little camcorder . . . it easy use takes great video , even under very low light conditions . i am extremely pleased this camcorder . i wish , however , proper cables hook up television included camcorder . it took couple trips fry finally get right cables use my television watch my videos . far camcorder goes - i highly recommend it anyone purchasing their first camcorder , price very reasonable , well	1
i sticked sony since i got my first digital camera 4 years ago sony camera moneys worth ! this one dsc-t10 one parent who carrying much already needs pack down change . it fits my purse still space more , only thing remember buy slim fitting case camera extra battery(for those kind battery not sold everywhere ) you need one when you don't thing you need extra battery , you always run out wrong time . i recommend this one	1
this my first digital camera , i lot search finaly i decide dsc-w55 black , what i looking , small enough it my purse , lot functions , very easy import pictures my computer , you only connect camera usb cable you don't need install software came camera , i windows vista i didn't any problems transfering pictures , best camera price great , you choose super saver shipping save more . you love this camera too , small , very pretty , lots options , take great pictures . some one wrote review this camera feels like plastic , that not true , looks very durable me i think good product worth every single dollar you spend . easy shoot pictures auto adjustment mode , start taking pictures sooner you charge battery , because this camera internal memory you buy memory card later . well hope you lots fun taking pictures , good luck ..!	1
i really love my first digital camera ! i searched i searched i finally found what i wanted . pictures crystal clear , movie playback exceptional - you only hear what you're supposed , no loud background noise or static , no muffled noise . pictures come out so clear after you take picture you zoom 5x count pores your face ! i love it ! i don't think i could ask better camera . i hope this camera last me atleast 4 years or more or until i graduate college . if one market afford it , get this camera ! there cheaper cameras but if you want get camera , get good one , doesn't mean it expensive , but my opinion you get what you pay . thanks reading . happy buying	1
pros : fantastic " straight outta box " image quality . there almost little or no shutter lag second your press shutter button . auto focus fast too . it wasn't so much this standard point-and-shoot when i looking ultra-slim camera - but most ultra-slim cameras i've tried sacrifice image quality cram much technology such little body - while boosting price up . lz7 fantastic performer . 6x optical zoom optical image stabilization ( not digital , i'm not fan " digital " image stabilization ) plus . it actually better than canon sd700is sd800is i previously tested out ( i returned both them because paying dslr body prices point-and-shoot camera outrageous ) . major plus this camera image quality . fantastic , sharp decently saturated . it one few cameras where i feel comfortable printing photos straight outta camera . i even impressed few colleagues showing some 8x10s i printed straight out my silver lz7 they shocked i didn't take shot dslr . that what i call great image quality ! cons : this quite beefy camera . age ultra-slim point-and-shoot cameras boasts same features lz7 , price i paid it , it totally worth it . use aa batteries might convenient some , but it sure contributes weight size this camera . i'm still pleased regardless . image quality pros outweigh cons this camera	1
lithium-ion batteries last longer than aa batteries , but you still need this accessory recharging . i'd suggest buying least one other battery alternate . it take 1.5 -2 hours recharge one battery fully . you also buy adapter travel overseas . you don't want stuck paradise without enough batteries lithium-ion batteries not readily available everywhere . this recharger less expensive than most	1
can't go wrong sony . great speed visual . don't think twice buying it	1
cable working perfectly . what joy able transfer video my computer . i bought tis cable used , but it showes no sign wear all . i however expect it jvc brand core filter . maybe thats what all braided sheilding . regardless , i havn't gotten any interfearence so i'm happy	1
pros : made metal screws easily into camera housing protecting lense assembly it powers up while use . inside threads outer rim accomodate filters totally protect lense damage allow you obtained filtered photos . cons : flared end cover partially occludes camera flash pattern creating small areas shadows . using external flash camera shoe solves issue . they could make flared end bit smaller correct this problem .	-1
i really enjoyed this product . it enhanced my picture taking next level . i highly recommended adding this product your camera bag . you won't regret it	1
i previously bought cheaper nikon range finder . i ended up taking it back getting pinseeker 1500 ( non slope ) . it picks up pin(doesn't need flag ) perfectly .. when rangefinders pick up pin some background clutter they always show you farthest distance . this because they optimized hunting ( picking up deer through brush ) . pinseeker always shows closer object ( optimized golf ) . it best range finder i used all who see it agree . buy it .	1
there isn't much more say here . this superb little camera , definately worth 10 cnet , not 7.0 their review gave it ! they completely got it wrong their rating because this camera definitely deserves least 8.0 ! here , it also gets my 5 stars ! far pros go this camera ( 28mm wide angle , 10x optical zoom , 3 '' lcd , , built-in lens cover ) , it exactly good it sounds ! real life needs real life situations real people loves superb photos right camera capture those moments . cons side ( no manual controls , no zoom video mode , average battery life ) , those practically only things more advanced user would care . manual controls mostly expert photographers white balance exposure settings already this camera , so i don't know what else you need . zooming video mode isn't important me since i don't particularly take much video footage . i only say average battery life because i tend look through photos i already shot pretty often without using power save lcd , therefore , that particularly what drains battery . however , you usually get @ 250-270 shots per charge , without frequent previewing . panasonic basically taken original tz1 made it even better . there not much missing this camera . i've said , 28mm wide angle leica lens , 10x optical zoom , 3 " high resolution screen , excellent image stabilization , etc . all this fairly compact camera . panasonic also improved " noise " higher iso . low light performance much better than previous panasonic models . most important this , camera takes fantastic pictures . thing i'm extremely impressed construction finish alone . just holding it your hands it screams quality feels like tank . i love it . it seriously feels like $700 camera . no exaggeration . i little worried it not able fit my jean pockets before buying it . women may issues really tight jeans but us guys no problem . it fits fine . i seriously can't believe i carry around camera 10x zoom inside my jean pockets . truly remarkable . 3 " screen amazing . you practically enjoy your pics right screen without even printing them high resolution output . image quality great , if you need extra sharpness want " canon-like look , " you could always use camera " vivid mode . " it also not much bigger or heavier than your overpriced sony . plus , here , i found it three hundred , high speed 1gb panasonic card included . what better than ?! only accessory i buy now just dmw-ct3-k , leather case specifically this camera . you really can't find perfect digital camera , but this comes close you get . overall , i am extremely pleased . if you looking great zoom camera small enough form factor , you should seriously consider dmc-tz3 . this best compact camera i've ever owned	1
i went ritz camera today took good look tz3 . i'll tell you , its pretty nice . build quality really good , previous person mentioned . body metal . dials buttons click precision , nice resistance . it nice weight it . i took some nice shots store . i must clicked off 100 pics . i'm impressed it . if you want something relatively small , powerful tough , this camera you . 10x zoom great , but such small camera it difficult hold it steady enough(at least me ) use zoom too much . i love build quality style , so i may biased . it nice piece equipment . i cannot speak photo quality only seen pics camera lcd	-1
dvx 100b cheaper than xl2 but you get more features . aside compact built xlr ports , you get optional flip out view finder which xl2 doesn't offer . if you looking non hd camera i would suggest going camera optional 24p because you'll getting your money worth it awesome feature ..	1
i bought this my mom grandma it really simple if you're using secure digital card ! just plug turn it plays . everyone complains display , but it like any other lcd display : it not perfect but it not less than i expected . it easy ( once my grandma found on/off switch ) nice piece around family gatherings ... only issue : lack instructions included . they very vague makes you not even want explore other things it may it	-1
this camera very small , sleek light . it takes great pictures lot features . only 3x zoom but zoom much farther once picture taken . i used olympus past never problem their products . :	-1
i olympus stylus 4mp loved it but wanted newer model . i purchased this 710 love it . olympus makes it so easy take pictures pre-set options image stabilization . i love smaller size this camera it easy use . there no way give it 4 1/2 stars so i gave it 5 but there one thing i don't like area usb plug . you pop off this cap ( it hangs off camera ) maneuver small end cable camera ( tight fit cap hanging there ) then pop cap back .. it just seems flimsy i wonder if cap eventually break off . 410 it much easier access this it near memory card . only design feature i don't care 710 . it great camera i am very happy purchase .	1
i just bought this camcorder am not good reader manuals . i it recording matter minutes . you format mini dvds , but easy find manual . quality recording looked great my computer screen . i bought office depot mini dvds they worked fine , great price . this panasonic great recording straight mini dvds wonderful idea . i would given it 5 star rating , but finalizing mini dvd took while you plug it , you can't this using battery . also i warned , if you use dvd-ram instead dvd-r , they not work all players they prefer work panasonic equipment . this why i opted non re-writable mini dvd-r office depot . i also bought pny sd card them card reader , all very affordable easy use	-1
i'm not going imply these best eyepieces available but they good eyepieces they incredibly affordable . they essentially celestron " omni " series plossl eyepieces , which their least expensive series retail $30 - $40 each . just eyepieces alone worth $100 . barlow lens quality piece but fairly redundant these eyepieces unless you very short focal ratio telescope . color filters good all around set but they would only useful 8 " larger telescopes then only planetary viewing . i don't care moon filter . it better than nothing , but i prefer using polarizing filter moon . so buy it case eyepieces if you get any use out rest just frosting cake	1
this worked advertised initial charge not take more than couple hours . i not used car adapter yet	1
this small camera big features . 7 megapix detail photos awesome very clear . zoom feature great but best features compact size ( fit shirt pocket ) ease control buttons . after dealing lots other digital cameras difficult use control features such deleting photo or organizing your photos , this camera proven easiest camera i ever operate . even child figure this one out . i love it	1
we took case barrier reef 6 snorkeling trips . camera worked wonderfully . there no leakage , fog during all 6 uses . only thing since it bright outside , there lot glare made it hard see lcd screen , but more camera issue than case . i would recommend this product over any disposable underwater camera . worth every penny	1
i've this product month used it go kayaking , whitewater rafting , snorkling . it keeps water out camera chamber nicely , but after rafting , i noticed small amount water entered top part where buttons . it didn't affect operation camera , no water or condensation found main chamber . i left it open few days it dried out . i not this problem while snorkling , which suggests it may due pressure camera wedged lifejacket my chest ... probably not good idea camera , but i didn't want lose it ! other items note - - neck strap it comes good adjustable- it quite small , but roomy enough inside small anti-moisture packet- operating it just easy without case , exception optical viewfinder , which cannot used- case comes clip-on diffuser flash , which works nicely plastic case distorts light without it- steel pin forms hinge case already rusted ... could due salt water , though i careful rinse it freshwater after each use ; again though , won't affect operation camera , nor integrity waterproof seala possible improvement canon consider would option adding clip-on lens cap protect surface scratche	1
panasonic seems altered design somewhat . case i got looked little different image this page . badge says " panasonic " , not " lumix . " not big deal . if you want attach this case your belt or your backpack , though , you're going find or buy mini-carabiner , because contrary what some product photos suggest , this case not come one . see " customer images " what my case looks like	-1
fits fine , but its little hard get it fast , it goes well design .	-1
excellent charger , no problems ever , 4 different lightings let me know how far charged it . fast charging , prongs fold up easy transporting . also very light compact	1
i looking forward using this highly rated camera taking video our new son . unfortunately , camera tape mechanism went out after first 4 months i send camera illinois repaired , also get tape out camera . camera out 6 weeks . refurbished camera lasted approx . 6 more months , sent it back again this time it cost me $168 it refurbished . now after couple months camera showing white lcd screen not function all . time give up panasonic . their customer service non-existant getting camera repaired again seems like waste time	-1

10mp , this camera takes some clearest visually stunning pictures i ever taken digital camera . clarity detail alone reason get this camera . display , although pooh-poohed others too small , quite large me . cameras small , lithe design selling point . nothing bulky this camera . you put it your front pants-pocket if you needed . yourself favor get this camera . you won't regret it .	1
i purchased this camera primarily back-up camera . but i find myself using it more more inplace my main camera . it beautiful piece work	1
my only complaint : built-in flashes these cameras limited range . if you're shooting dark room subject 30 feet away , it time upgrade digital slr . otherwise - this great camera	1
i two nikon coolpix 995 cameras hated them both . i also canon rebel xt which great camera more " intended " use . but canon too large tote me my last trip asia , so , advice friend , i decided i would pick up small digital camera sinapore " pennies dollar " . so , knowing nothing prices recreational digital cameras , i picked up this camera 220 usd , time , felt pretty good it ( again , same friend suggested 220 good buy ) . this place supposed electronic dumping grounds chinese production lines but i paid double what amazon it . i love camera because it reliably takes good pictures little effort inside out slips inconspicuously into my pocket when not use . i would strongly recommend buying this product amazon or one its syblings such l11 . . .	-1
simple features , i got it work it job what we need	-1
this not only ideal scope beginners but enough instrument show you new things sky years come . it sturdy simple operate . it enough light-gathering power ( more important than magnification ) reveal dim star clusters , nebulae , galaxies good enough optics show you surface planets like jupiter , saturn , mars . affordable this scope , there no reason give so much glance numerous trashy 60mm refractors exaggerated magnification claims litter market . some advice selection . dobsonians like this one come range sizes . 114mm ( 4 � " ) bit small side but still fine instrument , especially if your ability carry large objects limited . 200mm ( 8 " ) scope like this one right middle recommended range . 250mm ( 10 " ) big side , you should buy one only if you able-bodied . some advice use . viewing through telescope less like playing cd more like playing guitar . finding objects takes little bit practice . simplify it , i would suggest discarding finder supplied this scope installing two finders : 50mm " crosshair " finder plus red-dot finder aid initial pointing . you also need buy atlas ( sky telescope pocket sky atlas best available ) , red flashlight view charts without blowing out your badly-needed night vision , guidebook lead you interesting objects . these investments greatly add your enjoyment . what more i say ? this kind scope experienced observers trying steer novices towards decades . although , i recommend you your homework before buying any scope -- learn sky get know experienced stargazers who advise you -- when it comes time purchase , you could hardly better than this scope . more advice , see my encyclopedic guide here amazon , " so you want buy telescope .	1

i love this camera . i bought it my trip paris . i found it very easy use . one feature i didn't realize it video sound . i found very useful . i bought 2gb memory card go camera . one it comes doesn't hold many pictures . software easy install use . not really small enough pocket but still great camera budget	1
this my 3rd digital camera i bought this one supplement my larger 10x zoom camera . this one fits nicely into pocket or small camera bag easily take it all events or travel . i've found it takes nice photos indoors when flash used .... even when cats or dogs i'm shooting moving around . i've felt life battery set pretty good , but i've using nice rechargeable ones . definitely get set 4 , then you 2 use 2 backup set . settings pretty easy figure out change 99% my photos taken " auto " setting came out pretty good . others indicated , indoors - without flash - produce blurry photos , but that nature almost all cameras , not unique this model . glad i bought it would highly recommend it	1

these tdk 8 cm ( 3 . ) dvd-r blanks used mostly dvd camcorders panasonic , sony hitachi . i use them my beloved panasonic vdr-d300 3ccd dvd camcorder ( see my review camcorder amazon ) . these dvd-r blanks pre-formatted so all i need pop one into my panasonic start shooting . i shoot highest quality setting ( called " xp " panasonic ) which gives me 18 minutes recording time . after i'm one disk , i finalize it panasonic which makes it playable all dvd players well most computer dvd-rom drives .

pros : high quality construction , nothing it feels cheap . comes lens hood . great telephoto capability . excellent price starter telephoto lens . cons : quite bit chromatic abberation around edges 200mm-300mm . you'll definately want use tripod this anything above 100mm since there no . overall , if you want lens simply because you want wide range ability zoom far get this . if you want quality pictures however , look elsewhere . i'm thinking spending ~ $500 one canon image stabilization lenses	1

we got this dvd share station wedding gift . my wife i decided not wedding lunch keep money buy us jvc everio hard drive camcorder so we could it our honeymoon first few years our new life together . we took some video burned dvd share station dvd came burner . then we edited video our computer tried burn it . it didn't work . so , we went out bought more burnable dvds . i just thought i some faulty , cheap blank dvds , so we bought some nice sony dvd + rw discs . they didn't work . i got upset checked reviews online , all them pretty much bad saying this burner didn't work . well , next day , we read instructions learned there differance dvd + dvd - discs . we learned dvd + rws dvd - rws didn't work burner , it picky which brand you use , you make sure it it dvd - formatted disc . jvc , sony , tdk , verbatim dvd-r discs ones work . ever since we learned , all our dvds burned perfectly everything great . it pain butt figuring out what wrong , but now it working , i am very impressed this burner . i hope people who problems theirs read this review try what i suggested before getting upset returning it	-1
i nikon coolpix which small but too big shove into my pocket so i bought sony . i love it small , get used making sure my fingers not within lense view . extra battery memory sticks run up cost ( but goes any digital camera ) . it easy use since i'm not much one reading instruction books yet able figure things out fairly easily . i don't movies so can't comment but straight photos turn out really well ( which surprises me since i've always really lousy photographer ) . i like i carry it me all time , which i . i wrap whole camera small cloth envelope so lcd doesn't get scratched up . i added neck lanyard usually used computer flash key so i wear camera around my neck or wrap strap around my hands just case it slips out my fingers -- camera so lightweight . only complaint i shutter door , which slides effortlessly turn camera , slides effortlessly even when you don't want it . i've used up battery many times while camera sitting my pocket ( so i always carry extra battery me ) . extra plus loading pics onto computer breeze ( no extra software needed , just cable comes camera ) . there still slight delay depressing button take picture when camera actually takes picture but it not bad nikon . i assume newer versions this camera only gotten better . well worth money ( i just wish i could lock shutter cover )	-1

i almost didn't buy this camera based all negative reviews up here amazon , but i decided give it shot it turned out i am extremely happy this camera would highly recommend it any new parents . no it not give you image good your camcorder . yes there may some static interference picture . yes it may interfere your wireless network ( just turn off camera whenever you go online , or if you feeling motivated you pretty easily tweak your wireless network so they don't conflict ) . but what you * * get self-contained wireless video camera shoot total darkness ... plus portable battery powered video monitor only $120 . it actually works set up few minutes . amazing me . also there av out mobi video monitor so you run ( included ) cable directly mobi monitor your main tv set . my wife i usually like watch one tv show before we go sleep , this one time day we relax just spend time together , it extremely useful able just hit button remote go " project runway " real time image our baby sleeping next room . you also set mobi monitor only turn when there movement - we set little mobi monitor next our tv so if we see it turn we swith main tv over see what happening our big screen . we audio monitors but able actually see your baby much , much more helpful . oftentimes our daughter fuss silently before actually waking up , so when we see her start move around we know we need get ready deal her . also you don't need " gadget dad " make this work . we just plugged ours , set frequency ( , or ) , it good go . so , if you afford $120 i would highly recommend this device . it made us much more effective parents	1
i cant say enough ease operation , results this camera ... photos superb , it handles nicely . i cant wait get telephoto conversion lens it . not advised , but it dropped off my side table without case none worse wear , thank goodness . sturdy camera well worth price .	1

i very pleased canon 18x50 binoculars . we took them galapagos islands they performed well . teh really assists ship rocking minor shakes . i few thoughts would make these binoculars more user friendly . 1 . try make them lighter . my wife found it difficult carry them extended periods time . 2 . please add fip open ocular objective lens caps rather than loose caps . these get lost ones tied binocular body make it easier cover lneses inclement weather . 3 . making units water proof not just resistent would big factor those us who use binoculars nature photography especiall canoe or kayak . 4 . optional camera adaptor would great photography buffs . overall this binocular great addition human eye .	1
first , i couldn't decide fujinon canon then i never able take them outside try them out and/or compare them . so , i finally just bought pair canon 18x50s hoped best when they arrived i looked thru pushed button . boy , what waste several years . why didn't i buy pair when they first came out ? i could using them all this time . instead , i dithered over cost vs . results really regret fun i missed meanwhile . only difference these versus regular binocs one button . when you push it , there little click then , wow . after investing plenty telescopes , computer tracking mounts , etc ., these should much higher priority . oh yeah , they're light enough take anywhere viewing fatigue really much less than others ( especially since my hands really pretty shaky anyway i drink plenty coffee )	1
this very nice case . rigid , well made leather . note : this case not intended completely seal your camera -- no ziper . design more rigid also allows you unsnap strap fasten case your belt -- very cool . other strap snaps open top where f10 slides out . when attached your belt , its really easy quickly get camera out rapid access snap securely protects camera . it works similar cell phone ! you need add small camera cord comes f10 camera -- this makes it easy pull it out case . very happy this case	1

i very excited getting this since every time i take my camera beach i'm worried getting water it . when i got it i little discouraged ; it rubber liner greased up before use ( little annoying , but they give you grease , it basically just petroleum jelly , it goes easily enough ) it specifically states if you damage product while using case it not sony fault . so , i terrified still first time i used it . but after getting it all together going whitewater rafting trip where i able take pictures down whole river without worrying , i'm completely satisfied . case worked flawlessly , not drop water got , i it completely submerged more than once . took few great underwater shots . down side , i really wanting use this beach ocean , but it warns manual salt water get rubber liner , dry , leave salt crystals there damage liner prevent it working correctly . so , i guess i won't dunking it ocean anytime soon , or least until i find some replacement liners	1
very quick service delivery . great value choice working amazon . used their web site again already	1
it good get case strap price other places sell battery only . unfortunately , spare battery pretty much necessity camera . this case pretty nice carrying it around . it fits camera tight , so not " travel " case . it isn't made fit spare battery or charger . but , i've found you jam spare battery there camera . you completely remove camera take picture though battery fall out while you're it . strap pretty nice , but camera gets heavy around your neck after just short time	-1
i won't repeat all stuff other reviews . let me just say i bought this camera replace d100 , fine nikon dslr . i tired " lens fever " never ending . also , bulk weight all equipment tiring . 8800 some lag , just like all non-slr cameras . but , i've learned live it . i just pace myself . continuous shooting modes give you ample opportunity shoot action sports . quality pictures awesome . zoom lens gives me all i my 5 pound lens . speed isn't everything maybe this camera isn't everyone , but it meeting my needs . i'm not going back my dslr	1
i previous nikkor 70-300 mm f/4- 5.6 version , which lighter much slower focus not vr . vr godsend , helps me handhold low light low shutter speeds . very nice lens . i use it every day my bird blog . it twice heavy version that bothersome , but price it amazing	1
nikkor 70-300mm vr lens everything i hoped it would . i am able get much closer whatever i am photographing , pictures come out crisp , clear colorful . i'd recommend this lens any photo enthusiast	1

this radar gun works fine me . i didn't problems others reported . trigger sweet spot reported review , but it minor problem . gun baseball mode , but i use it measuring speed cars . it works whether car coming toward you or away form you . i also tried it my vehicle read speed difference me cars passing well combined speed mine those approaching . you easily figure real speed additon or subtraction . i surprised find it read my speed just pointing straight out windshield . i don't know how , but it . i guess it reads stationary objects up ahead , although there no signs or bridges nearby . it claims read car speed 1300 ft , so maybe it locked structure far off . smaller object , closer it . i locked onto 14 mph dog 200 feet	-1
i bought this tripod just few days ago through amazon.com . first , it shipped time arrived first estimate date . it got basic features , although it may not stand up wilderness , it certainly well made . all movements smooth , don't jerk all . i owned couple cheaper tripods wal-mart , paid $25 them . this only little more money , but you get lot quality price	1
this tripod stand very sturdy its not heavy means you carry this stand you very easily . only thing it lacks it case handle help which it could easier carry it .	-1
this my 3rd nikon coolpix . 995 , 4500 now 8400 . excellant photos , controls wideangle terrific . nothing short what i expected . i could go its great auto manual features . however , just word what i don't like . no ability connect remote control , probably just my gripe , but would nice still utilize usb port nikon remote or after market digi-snap i used my 995 or 4500 . oh well . also , limited ability use various threaded filters len . nikon ( 3 ) selections limited . i found 37mm adapter 52 or 55mm work ... but you still watch out very carefully not cross thread putting it taking it off . lastly , when using their 3x tele converter 995 or 4500 it becomes fixed focal length no zoom all . also their 2x works well applications i use . if you live these short comings you just love output 8400 . i also adjust when using " extra fine " , getting 132 photos 1 gig cf card .	1
this film worked really well me when i took my first photography class . price right , it performed well weekly asignments given us class	-1
i originally bought this camera because my job , now i use it almost all my picture taking . i 35mm canon rebel eos but i always running film developed . i bought this camera so i could get my pictures easier ( cheaper ) . it really easy camera use . mostly point shoot , but it allow you control many options . we lot horticultural diagnostics work always getting calls come out figure out what wrong plant or id insect , plant etc . macro mode this camera takes best pictures insects small items . our diagnostic clinic able id mushrooms diseases this camera pictures ( which says lot this camera quality ) . size camera awesome . it small lightweight fit purse or pocket . i able go out into extremely muddy horse pasture yesterday diagnostic work i able not worry my camera because it tucked away safely my pocket . this not something i could my 35mm . i also use this camera outside work . it really well low light . i able take pictures dark auditorium during choir concert without flash pictures come out great . it takes great landscape pictures . software download pictures into computer really easy use . its set up automatically download photos soon you plug it into usb port using cable comes camera . no special docks required . only drawbacks it : 1- you really need sd card supplement storage . without it you only store 4-7 pictures . 2- i also recommend getting rechargeable batteries . these saved me numerous times because you tend go through batteries pretty fast when you use it much i . overall i highly recommend this camera	1
i used this few months now really noticed difference my photos . i nikon d50 sb-600 flash . prior this purchased i some very harsh flash effects such over exposure faces drastic shadows behind subjects . since then , i feel i able manage those effects much more easily . cost item , i would recommend it anyone who uses flashes wants mute effects some	1
i owned one previous models originally sold throughwallgreens returnable " one-time use " video camera . theory you didn't actually " own " camera . you would pay $30 it ; shoot some videos ; then return it store get dvd your videos . but course , people figured out how hack camera add usb cable download videos , so you didn't need return camera get videos . so this new psv-351 looks like " legit " model pure digitalcame out satisfy demand all people buying theolder models never returning them . smart move ! instead complaining , give pople what they want . if you can't beat ' em join ' em . even three times price what i paid my hacked versioni would easily buy legit one . i loved my hacked psv . i kept telling people " pure digitalshould sell these ! " it very simple camera . it doesn't tryto pretend more than it . it very few features . but what it it well . you push big red button it records good quality video ( quality impressive price ) . i'm big fan simple products work well -- like nintendo or ipod . this camera looks bit like toy , but it durable . this would actually make good toy kid or adult . ergonomics nice . it comfortable hold . quality construction very good . i like fact it runs two ordinary aa batteries , soyou don't need charger . i would buy one these -- or maybe even few them . buy bunch them pass them out wedding . duct tape one your motorcycle helmet . tie one kite	1
camera works fine i record performances various bands i play . sound ok ( just remember keep your fingers away mike ) , it records fairly well most nightclub situations , but if it dark , video dark well . usb connection great thing , but remember it needs disconnected via software before you jerk camera away computer . i damaged hard drive my very first use , now i only record 16min . video before i'm full . it my fault	-1

i received camera mail yesterday . i walked back my dorm , i thought perhaps there'd mistake ; there no way this light package could it . there no way this could camera i'd just ordered last wednesday . it probably memory card . i opened box sure enough , it camera . made steel incredibly light small , this camera major upgrade compared what i used before it . i dare say this camera probably last one i'll use ( barring disastrous drop ) while . it takes clear pictures , even though i shaky hands . i am going recommend this camera friend never camera . i become more accustomed using camera , i'll probably end up updating my review it , something tells me it'll consist primarily positive things	-1

i recently purchased rebel t2 camera body only after my canon eos rebel 2000 gave its " last gasp " . i canon user since 1979 ae-1 ( i still ) . i liked fact t2 body plugged immediately into two ef lenses i owned ( 28-80mm 75-300mm ) , which protected my previous investments . i taking pictures within seconds opening package loading batteries . although i my sights set digital rebel some point soon , you just can't beat quality traditional 35-mm film photoprocessing . upgrade over eos rebel 2000 , lcd located camera back easier read . also , t2 seems more " solid " me , but lighter weight . i took older eos rebel 2000 me couple 75-mile backpacks ( which probably led its early demise ) , so i now new-found respect lighter design . final note , i also appreciated ease ordering via amazon.com . there plenty web sites offering same canon t2 camera back , including those which would saved me few dollars . but none long-standing relationship i amazon over past several years	1

this camera takes amazing pictures . there so many settings this camera . i very stuck picking camera first , then i narrowed it down either this camera or canon sd900 . i decided get this one because it $80.00 cheaper . it gives lot bang your buck . also continuous shot mode you take so many pics really quickly . great battery life . my grade this cam	1
i purchased sony dsc-n2 10mp camera month ago . i liked features large 3 " lcd screen but i little nervous touch screen . however , after reading few reviews i would give it try . touch screen works great camera takes great pictures . it very fast startup quickly saves pictures without noticeable delay even using highest resolution . it high iso sensitivity when activated takes great pictures almost pitch black conditions . menus easy use allow quiet bit customization . online ordering amazon easy camera arrived factory boxes within couple days via ups . i very satisfied my purchase	1
this sony n2 10.1 mega pixels replaces my old sony 3.2 mega pixels cyber-shot . i love this camera . pictures nice clear even i used 5 mega pixels . actually , 5 mega pixels enough me . touch panel easy use . 3 " screen very big veiw your pictures videos . all my colleagues friends love this camera too . reasonable price easy use . only thing i don't like picture too bright when i select auto flash light . otherwise , this perfect camera .	1
i going purchase this same item sony but whole lot more ! this product allowed me capture awesome views hawaii . totally recommend it your digital camera	1
sony vcl-dh2630 telephoto conversion lens compatible cybershot digital cameras ( purchased 07/17/2005 ) sony vad-wa conversion lens adapter dscw1/w5/w7 digital cameras ( purchased 07/17/2005 ) you need both . they allow you get shots camera telephoto not pick up detail . i learned this hard way when i took series shots three wolves stalking dozen caribou . i little splotches . i swore then get telephoto . you need both items function . they relatively heavy size camera . there just one magification no adjustment . so what you see what you get . it expand your use good versaltile pocket camera . i buy it again	-1
i purchased this camera looking take more manual control over my video projects . exactly what it allowed me . it right balance manual controls ( well automatic modes ) price . it given me flexibility i looking . weight balance good , controls easily accessible battery life very good	1
this unit pretty awesome especially frame . also , noteworthy thing this camera first 16 9 then encoding producing higher quality image than comparable sony model . i've actually owned precursor unit this one , gl1 , also pleased i t.t his camera hotshoe feature longest optical zoom its class . optical vs digital , optical definitely wins . this camera all-a-round useful also , this unit actually preferred camera choice many sports film-makers . if you take this thing slopes like i , strangers come up you instantly recognize unit . great kenko lenses . only actual thing i've seen it doesn't like low light , so adding vl-3 must , or vl-10 recommended . one thing watch out you must keep care camera . example , you must get yourself tape-head-cleaner . maxell good buy , but you could go oem if you want . also , don't cheap out cassettes . my 6 years using gl1/gl2 , i've always used tdk jvc tapes . jvcs come 6-pack found best buy . tdks also come 6-pack , you find them costco . more reference , i pushed this camera beyond its specification it rained , snowed , frozen point where there actually lag lcds yet , it still works like brand new . definitely good buy !	1
i agree previous poster , this lens very impressive . pictures this item not represent how big this lens actually . this thing massive heavy , yet you definately wield it without tripod . makes great addition already amazing camera . much better than using digital zoom itself , but then , digital zoom combined this lens equal 400mm . lens comes padded sony drawstring bag caps ends . definately recommended	1
this my first digital camera . prior this i simple kodak point-and-click model which pretty much quality disposible . i use much higher grade cameras work both 35mm digital . this camera gives you 5.1 mp ability though most shots only require 3mp . i like 32mb internal memory though i've also bought 256mb card traveling . 5x zoom isn't cool i initially thought it would digital zoom works sometimes not others but you must understand what digital zoom really . camera takes very clear optimal pictures . better pictures then i've taken anything else i've owned before ( some work cameras well ) . size small enough put your pocket but not too small one larger hands . different flash options shooting scenes turn difficult pictures into what you want capture . panoramic shot sequence especially favorite feature especially shoreline shots . i've also bought r-series dock enjoy its ability transfer my pictures faster charge two batteries once . this camera worth price you pay but i believe its 2005 model so it may not most up date but it great job .	1
pictures sharp colors true . extra large viewer envy our friends . only thing missing this camera image stabilization . it goes everywhere we go , you know , we don't leave home without it	1
this excellent digital camera !!! picture quality ; features ; design . 5 stars well earne	1
100% all nikon , some best pictures i ever taken . when i went kodak print machine print them out , i line people looking print quality . you cannot go wrong here , amazon best price everyone	1
i bought this camera my 9yr old son because price ( less than $100)and it turned out better than any canon digitals i owned . i learned log ago use rechargeable batteries , so i wouldn't let any posts regarding battery drain sway you purchase . my son autism gives this camera workout . it taken plenty abuse up 500 pictures per week past six months . video lighting modes incredible too , i get lot more " keepers " out this inexpensive camera than any i digital i owned date	1
function good , lots mode easy use . but now even s700 less expensive	-1
i pleasant surprised k10d it combines built-in image stabilization , self-cleaning sensor , easy-to-use image controls sealed body . it just fills right my hands . i'm not going repeat all good pints found previous reviews . but i want comments some " cons " . yang mi point out : " 10m not much bigger than 6m (* ist dl ) , it good but don't expect big difference ... " more pixels isn't give you better image . you wouldn't see difference 5x6 or 8x10 print . but if you want print 24x36 print this when you need more pixels . overall it great camera big step forward istds/k100 series cameras . i like k10 more controls body before bared menus . i like raw button big time . what hold me give k10d five stars it af . even af much improved ds still not fast nikon d70s . highly recommended	-1
i used this case my s80 multiple dive trips i am impressed not only you virtually every control function available but also picture quality you get . i little worried first one my dives supposedly right cases rating 130 ' . i actually logged dive 146 ' case held up fine . i knew i took risk though . just make sure you clean o-ring every so often , re-lube it soak case some fresh water once you return your dive trip you long lasting underwater housing . looking forward many more dives . weights extra , but very useful so your camera won't float up stays more steady . just make sure you strap it down your bc not loose it if you use weights :	1
usual canon produced quality product matched perfectly great camera . i this camera down 100 ft . without problem . i think this camera/case combo one best you find without spending over $1000 bucks many much more expensive units can't match it performance . my only complaint multi funtion wheel back camera not accessable when case so you cannot use most manual funtions require use wheel . like manual focus adjusting flash , exposure comp . white balance . this major consideration prosummers out there	-1
i bought this camera mostly home movies , after doing extensive research camcorders . first decision going hard-drive over dvd or tape . ease downloading videos your computer , plus fact it way most camcorders going heading near future made this almost no-brainer . then question which model buy . i chose sr82 over sr42 sr62 because extra storage capacity , improved resolution over sr42 . video resolution sr82 good enough most televisions . if you want hd video , you need spend least $200 or $300 more " entry-level " hd camera . i'm not too worried 1mp still photos because , let honest , i'm not planning use this camera take pictures ! i digital camera , which better resolution , low-light performance options than camcorder ever taking pictures . plus , it flash , which camcorders usually don't ( unless you're willing add accessory shoe external light ) . picture quality i mentioned pretty good , even low-light , camera very intuitive easy use right out box . downloading computer breeze too . get however extra battery , since one it comes usually runs out pretty fast	1
this kit all i expected more . bag easily holds my eos xt rebel both my lenses , external flash , batteries , chargers ..... room spare . bag alone worth price , battery filter great kicker	1
my initial thoughts this too expensive but when you consider quality bag canon battery , price starts become reasonable . bag high quality bag , effort give you idea what it hold i describe one load . digital rebel attached lense film based eos without attached lense two additional lenses one flash unit owners manuals spare batteries charger extra memory cards filters cables , hand shoulder straps it still additional room more gadgets toys . it tripod loops which i don't use . far canon battery , i've read other brand batteries aren't anywhere near good so getting genuine canon battery good ... i guess ... kit includes haze filter which generally considered " that nice , who cares " since they generally cheap enough considered freebie . i'm really torn 4 or 5 star rating . based quality merchandise , it would get 5 . based price , i'd drop rating . mark	-1
i agree first review posted here most part . i add i tried software not impressed . first , upon installation i received error message said software not windows certified , installation could cause my system become unstable . well , it . after installation , my system crashed daily basis . i sensed uninstalled contacted sony . they basically said it doesn't matter it not windows certified because it sony certified . alrighty then . once i uninstalled , crashes stopped . looking 3rd party sw use . it also worth noting camera equipped usb port , which i told best buy could used downloading video your pc . cable not included course . when i software installed , it not recognize camera when hooked up usb port . pdf hardcopy manuals included , usb interface poorly documented . chapters where it mentiods ieee interface , it says this must used download video . not mention usb alternative . when i took it back best buy answers , it even stumped geek squad . according sony , you select usb stream function cameras integrated menu . i still cannot get it work after following sony instructions . usually , usb ports camcorder reserved downloading still shots cameras slot flash memory . hc38 no such slot . they should left off usb port put mic/earphone jack . plan installing firewire capable expansion card if you don't one forget any ideas downloading via usb	-1
this camera great , it small compact very easy use . we love it	1
this great product , exactly what it supposed it well . it simple reasonably inexpensive . solid feeling camera . i picked up this version after disappointing experience folding model . my only beef i rotate my camera " wrong " way portrait oriented photo . this puts shutter release bottom instead top . it works , but slightly awkward me . not biggie it really help pictures due favorable position flash .	-1
i love this camera . color great , so fun makes me feel unique . screen great size , it takes great pictures . good red eye issue . menu great too , when you scroll thru things , it tells you what it so you don't memorize it all . takes fast pictures , but not one after , like i hoping . but it open fast . don't fooled big memory , you still need larger card . depending size pic you want , you take 30 50 pics memory alone . but all all i love this camera it great buy	-1
i really love my first digital camera ! i searched i searched i finally found what i wanted . pictures crystal clear , movie playback exceptional - you only hear what you're supposed , no loud background noise or static , no muffled noise . pictures come out so clear after you take picture you zoom 5x count pores your face ! i love it ! i don't think i could ask better camera . i hope this camera last me atleast 4 years or more or until i graduate college . if one market afford it , get this camera ! there cheaper cameras but if you want get camera , get good one , doesn't mean it expensive , but my opinion you get what you pay . thanks reading . happy buying	1
i've owned nikon hr-e5700 lens hood almost long i've owned my nikon 5700 . lens hood screws quickly removed just quickly . not only hood shade lens outside glare but its firm rubberized nature also protects lens accidental side-to-side dings accidents . there really shouldn't time when you need use lens hood speed light ( flash ) same time but if you then flash going obscured lip hood leaving darker shadow bottom image . if it weren't popup speed light i would leave lens hood permanently since it adds general bulk camera makes 5700 ( 8700 ) ' feel ' bit more substantial bit more like prosumer digital camera .	-1
product very convenient easy use . provide distance many different objects : trees , bunkers , water , flag , etc . better than lot caddies	1
gift avid golfer who really liked it can't wait use it - alask	1
i only used it few times like it , especially slope feature ( i'm not tournament player ) , but i must point out it took me while learn steady it enough get good readings . it still takes me too long get readings when flag more than 200 yds away , especially when there no wind when background cluttered . perhaps i get better results more use practice . i play friends who low handicappers ( i'm not ) who don't waste time course . while they ask me readings when slope hole great , i usually don't much time get readings keep playing steady pace . instruction manual too sketchy my liking	-1
this one most versatile compact cameras ever . 3 " display awesome . it makes it very easy frame subject also editing modifying pictures . this one , i own three digital cameras far , this most convenient easy use . prompts menu very logical easy follow . movie feature also awesome . sound quality best i've seen any camera this size . very impressed !!	1
i purchased this camera after more research than i put into buying car - well almost . it turned out very easy set up . touch screen menus work smoothly intuitively . you almost throw manual away unless you want get really technical . automatic setting covered just anything i've wanted so far . battery life seems good i especially like fact there no protruding lens get broken/jammed . i gave it only four stars because last item - durability - yet tested . so far , so good	-1

i've canon digital cameras past two years my first , opted purchase accompanying canon camera case . though it good fit , it couple flaws caused me look elsewhere case when i got my second digital camera this year . this time around , i chose tamrac case because , unlike canon , it zips closed . canon flap closure creates two big gaps either side case , allowing small particles get inside camera itself . second , tamrac features not only belt loop , like canon , but nice shoulder strap . this means user carry camera hands free without put it purse or backpack . this case fits many small film slim digital cameras ( go tamrac website download spec sheet lists camera/case compatability ) , so don't expect custom fit . my canon a510 , this case bit long side , but no so much so i concerned it shifting around too much case . it good bag great manufacturer decent price . recommended	-1

this also works d50 , mine actually came this unit instead en-el3 . it slightly higher capacity so that nice bonus , plus cheaper then en-el3 so it win-win . i took pictures all day just one battery so it last while . it good backup anyhow . if you're planning upgrade d200 , i'd suggest their new en-el3e , since also work d50/d70 ( but opposite not true so don't try force en-el3 or en-el3a into d200 ! )	1
yes this remote control only work sensor front camera . however lack cable release function 500 camera . rm-1 remote control just your best option when you trying perform micro or zoom photography .	1
i got this very handy accessory item go my digital camera . it compatable very handy taking family pictures holidays where you included picture . i know camera self timers , but who wants run breathless get frame time before camera fires . this way you take more time compose your picture it turns out great . i highly recommend this if you plan taking pictures any family gathering-or taking informal portraits home .	1
i purchassed this camera my first ever snorkling trip when i went bahama cruise . overall , i very pleased . pictures came out clear camera easy use even under water . only issue i it almost end roll film turn wheel jammed ceased work . i lost last two pictures . i'm not sure if it defect camera , or if i over zealous turning wheel my excitment event . considering quality developed pictures , i would certainly try this camera again .	-1

when you buy product designed meant fulfill certain needs , just expect best performance out those features . pc55 camera everyday home shooter , easy use made best sony quality one smallest mini dv camera ever created . if you thinking buying this camera don't hesitate one minute , this camcorder one kind , it gives you pretty much flexibility video quality regular camcorder but amazing bring-it-in-the-pocket size all coolness attention it brings ( let it your best ice breaker , believe me it works like heaven ! ) . i work camera store let me tell you : we haven't received one return this model during time i've worked there ( 8 months ) , which proves high quality sony built into this model . i using mine few months now all i say " product great ... period ! " . let get real , 500 bucks you paying it not film quality kind movie you get picture ( you need spend least couple thousand dollars ) but portability worriless no need big luggage camcorder used past " ( some times people don't realize motorcycle couldn't compared truck or vise versa ) . picture shooting option , well let see ! camcorder videos digital camera photos , if you want them both one package , brings excellent quality , you'd spend lot more money than if you bought them separately , let me explain you few words , average photo quality mini dv camcorder 1.3 mp or lower ( same quality you get out your cell phone camera ) honest you , manufacturers add this option just give it extra feature same time take more money out your pocket , tape less digital cameras it happens same way , video sound quality very poor ; so why bother paying more camera both functions excellent ( there quite few out market now , starting around $1200 models similar size ) instead buy two little cameras , one each use , half price . if you looking cool , high quality durability mini dv camcorder smallest size available its kind , sony dcr-pc55 your best option . finish , i just want wish you all enjoy , more than product , unmemorable moments you live your loved ones because this little fellow	1
if you want capture every precious moments , this right camcorder you . it easy operate video crisp clear . sound pretty good well . you also take still picture video same time ( thanks memory stick ) . don't burn your video using your computer , it took me time download cd or dvd . instead burn them you watch them . it quicker way . you love it first time you use it	1
so much praise already ... where i begin ? well this simply best camcorder i've ever owned or used . this level i've used gl2 past . but i bought vx2100 . i took some footage lake recently thought i looking film when i played it back my hdtv . color beautiful natural looking ! one rule . better lighting better picture ! my first camcorder jvc 87 ' vhs-c just same size this camcorder now . but me-o-my , what difference digital makes !! i dig ilink my camcorder my pc tv my dvd recorder . ilink run show ! many manual features lets dude take control play around when he wants too ! screen menu really simple manual this well written straight forward . but i must admit some dubbing info over my head present well using memory chip tapes . but i'll get there . 12x zoom could more but it also plenty ! stabilization works fine my needs , but alot what i shoot tripod mounted ! " put it tripod " { what movie ? } ha ha . 2 1/2 " lcd bit small , works fine , but i find myself gravitating eyepiece . it quicker use saves battery life . but lcd great turn 180 degrees shoot yourself { ha } use remote ! you might want buy sony 970 battery . don't waste or risk other brands , this one battery i used 6 hrs straight doing interview it still life it !! one come it course small battery lasts 2 1/2 hrs . thats rec . play-back , stand-by etc etc . just these two batteries all i need !!!!!! also i added wide angle lense . canon 58m wide anlge works fine this unit . some lighting too ; how smith victor 2 umbrella 250 watts lights . makes indoor shooting look like tv show ! lastly mic . depending your use , you might want shotgun mic outdoors , or lav mic indoors . camera mic people speaking rather close . all all i couldn't happier i bought " this " camcorder . i read looked around quite awhile before i bought . i think i more sony products my house than any other this now no exception ! lights , camera , action !	1
this camera one best its kind : ultra compact , great quality construction , friendly menu , excellent lens ( thanks leica ) very attractive price . it peforms according leica reputation , extremelly well . image stabilization boosts end results . however not expect results similar more expensive srls you disappointed especially cases 8x10 or even larger images noise becames factor- smaller images you should no problems you able capture your moments ease . again this one best choices compact digital camera market segmant there plenty options	1
this little thing perfect anyone who looking sleek , compact digital camera take amazing photos . i took it europe amazed shots it took - portraits , close-ups , landscapes , action , indoor , outdoor . no complaints	1
all digital camera force you make trade-offs ... it hard cruel fact personal photography . coolpix s3 , near perfect grab go camera four photographers our family . picture quality , our eyes , great ! when compared our rebel xt or d70 cameras , s3 shots loose bit information but only through comparison much more expensive equipment . this camera very easy use those new digital photography . pre-programmed scenarios easy access provide great shots . camera proven sturdy , survived couple bumps bruises without drama . we always keep it ballistic nylon case , though , protect screen . i'm convinced many problems people cite s3 ( or s1)are result unfamiliarity using camera features more-so than defect camera ( save white-spot issues which we not observed date ) . red-eye reduction semi effective but no more than any dozen newer cameras our hobby room . free online photo editors cure red-eye much better than any in-camera solutions . if you're looking digital camera always at-hand deliver great photo , s3 should your list check-out	1
this might worst product ever . what good camcorder if it virtually impossible get video onto your computer . support horrid ; software worse . stay away this one . too bad really , most my previous electronics equipment made sony , but i never buy them again	-1
some 50 years , beginning leica iiig i bought 1950 , i used variety 35mm digital still cameras . i figured it time try my hand video . i spent several days researching variety entry level video cameras finally decided dcr-hc32 . given slight difference price bare camera this package , i went package . handycam arrived couple days ago i immediately put it use filming one my grandchildren . it not long before i realized capturing images video more complicated when using still camera . i put handycam down picked up operating guide . after spending time reading guide checking out multitude options this little camera provides , i called my grandchild back more product testing . results gratifying . it not seem possible such small videotape provide such crystal clear images , but it . i experienced bit shake when zooming , even steadyshot turned , but may least part attributed these old hands . i conducted most my early video trials my den night , single overhead flourescent light providing only illumination . even without slowing shutter color beautiful . i sent my grandchild shadowy corner 20 feet camera try out super nightshot . it worked well . color thin but good . then i turned out light shot super nightshot plus . what i got incredibly grainy black white image recognizable human , but that all . i ordered infrared light use very dim dark light . filming video outdoors bright sunny day , results crystal clear color excellent . sound pickup more than couple yards handycam disappointing . i wish this camera jack accessory microphone . still picture quality certainly could better . however , i fine digital still camera take care usual still photography work still images this handycam creates may not studio quality , but ones i made certainly adequate sharing or adding family album . i not doubt there times when using handycam i would like capture some special moment still picture . this use , handycam works just fine , far i am concernedi am well pleased this little camera unhesitatingly recommend it anyone interested buying quality introductory level video camera . using sony dvm60pr3 cassettes image color clarity surprisingly good . i urge anyone not familiar small video cameras heed sony suggestion spend time operating guide while battery getting its first charge .	1
professional reviews sold me this camera , experience buying it through amazon exceeded my expectations . camera arrived ahead schedule camera performs great - even after i dropped it once	1
i've this camera 5 1/2 months it it way shop repaired 2nd time . first time they nothing it . not sure what wrong tech . i bought this good quality pictures frame . when i'm ready photograph it sits shop . would i suggest this camera serious photographer ? no i would not . my trip 30 days where my camera ? not me!i'm very disappointed . i thought kodak better products repair set up than this . buy extended warranty if you get this camera . outside pictures white . inside pictures red/blue lines across . i grandchildren way no camera take them . * sigh*i could go but you get my point this . kodak much proving me sell me again	1
i purchased this replace olympus camera pretty much junk day it new . i hesitant kodak because some their earlier cameras complicated hard use . i wanted buy camera use product pictures business use family photos , vacations such . my previous cameras used only product pictures because image quality fair best . prints made digital images not photo quality my opinion . z612 pleasant surprise . it easy use , controls fairly simple . you not need engineering degree use it . screen bright fairly easy see even bright light . quality pictures great . zoom fantastic . auto focus wonderful feature actually works very well . bad - " easyshare " software pretty much hijacks all images your computer . it installs it self so it automatically starts when you boot your computer , changes all image icons easyshare icon . it not offer many options installation or operation . it appears work ok but it more problem than problem solver advanced users . i personally use photoshop not want other generic software trying dominate image editor . camera should come memory card well internal memory . this time memory card sold seperately which adds $ 30.00 price camera . camera comes neck strap no wrist strap . wrist strap would nice addition prevent camera making it all way ground if it dropped while use . overall it great camera great value . i other digital cameras cost three times much virtually useless .	1
i'm not sure why people complaining this backpack so small since description pictures accurate ( though it looks smaller real life scale not all obvious ) . i easily fit medium sized camera 28-300 lens attached 18-55 lens directly below it . i don't other lenses fill up side partitions main compartment , but could easily fit 2 4 more lenses ( depending size ) these areas . sides main compartment seem bit tighter fit things , however . even conservative , this pack should fit camera lens attached , 2 additional lenses flash main compartment . smaller front pocket i fit 2 memory cards , compact lens cleaning kit , larger lens cloth , 8 aa batteries , compact charger . mini-tripod or compact water bottle would fit outside pocket/strap . don't expect carry huge amounts additional things this pack aside additional small items like keys , wallet , map , cell phone . you're not going putting your thermos , picnic lunch jacket here . it not even big most computer backpacks , but it certainly doesn't claim . you might fit some small additional items , but not anything bulky . construction seems good it reasonably rigid well padded . it good value price	-1
i've this camera pack while now i just can't live without it . after reading tons reviews researching other sites stores , i decided this would fit my needs best . it small , light weight carries everything inside it without drawing attention itself . i carry my canon 20d all my accessories plus few personal extras all day without back pain or tiring out . trust me , when it mardi gras big easy , means lot ! i carry following my pack :( while i able fit everything listed below inside , mind you , it tightly packed)**canon 20d 100mm lens attached ( without hood ) strap**18-55 kit lens**promaster external flash unit 2 stofen omni bounce diffusers**backup camera battery charger ** 3 4/packs aa batteries ( flash unit)**all my owner manuals plus medium sized handbook ( i'm beginner)**lens cloth small airblower bottle lens cleaning**cords hooking camera tv pc**2 backup memory cards ( red flap extremely handy keep track used cards)**small notebook pen , few personal items such chapstick , headband etc ... ** cell phone ( hooked outside)**water bottle ( hooked outside)**sunglasses ( outer pocket -meant tripod)plus : 1 . size - perfect medium sized female2 . construction - extremely well made , sturdy fabric , lots padding great job keep humidity out ( big deal down here)3 . organized - it repositionable/removable compartment dividers , packing what you need breeze ... plus there lots hooks such outside additional options ... you add tripod if you choose . 4 . color makes it look like any normal back pack . 5 . price great what i got . minus : ( very minor , but these my reasons giving 4 opposed 5 stars)1 . rain flap over zippers make opening closing somewhat combersome , but you get used it . besides it like extra layer protection ( both rain thieving hands ) . 2 . if you want fit external flash extra lenses , you may consider larger bag . 3 . it doesn't really great job carrying my tripod . it becomes too difficult get my camera out pack tripod attached ( you remove tripod before you able open bag , not most convenient while walking around ) .	-1
i use this great product when playing golf while hunting . plus it just fun great discussion item . it very accurate precise	1
i love size style this little camera bag . it only single compartment shoulder strap nice long . long enough use around waist fanny pack . bag itself isn't padded inside it rather stiff . tight fit my camera , but good protection i think . i just wanted keep my camera getting scratched up this trick nicely	-1
i purchased this bundle last week amazon , first price ($170)was amazing it arrived only two days standard shipping . i able use camera right out box , although after few pictures i need put it printer dock charge it but couple hours later it fully charged . this awesome bundle , it even comes small pack paper so you start printing pictures right away , which i printer very easy use just plug it , put camera top , press print button you great picture minute later . this my second digital camera i am so impressed it , this exactly what i looking . i wanted camera higher number megapixels , my old camera 1.3 , i wanted able take picture no delay time you press button time it actually takes picture . if you kids you defenitly don't want delay . i purchase memory card since camera only holds 11 or 12 pictures it internal memory . if you looking easy use camera good picture quality ease printing your pictures home then this perfect camera printer you .	1
i very nervous because this item not ship when expected but both times i called customer service updates they very helpful i end up getting this plenty time christmas . i would definitely buy them again	1
i am always taking pictures i am so thoroughly impressed fuji film especially 200 iso it only film i use- kodak doesnt seem deliver results i want when i tried fuji- it became my favorite right off- great colors , bold , doesnt mute them like i found kodak do- highly recommend	1
i bought this present someone who isn't technically saavy . they absolutly loved it . easy use functions great photo quality made this excellent gift .	1
charge lasts long time through most 512 digital card . i keep charged one back-up	1
modern 400 speed films better every way than slow 100 speed films when i first started shooting 35mm . because this i see no reason shoot anything slower than iso 400 these days . all color films i like fuji superia best ; colors rich saturated without looking unatural . grain sharpness very good fast film . this now my standard film . i buy bricks fuji superia x-tra onsies twosies everything else my pictures never looked better	1
while picture quality 400 speed doesn't quite compare 100 speeds , this film simply awesome . sometimes artificial colors ( punchy reds deep blues ) really bring out ' pop ' most scenes ( especially grey days ) . terms all around consumer film , this simply best what i use when i shoot my pamp ;s . what makes this film so spectacular even higher speed , you don't sacrifce picture quality color saturation , making it possible hand-hold even dim or night situations . colors great picture quality nearly indistinguishable slower speed films . simply put , only film i like more fuji reala	-1
very easy use , using it over two years now . great quality pics easy print , command , choose options quickly . also take fast photos so you not miss any moments . also like video mode shot blips when i forget or not want carry camcorder	1
if you looking dslr under 700 bucks this camera get . this camera improves * ist dl almost every way . shake reduction awesome , battery life great , pictures clear , 11-point af godsend these cameras , kit lens best compared nikon canons kit lenses-it produces sharp clear images , fact it uses aa batteries sd cards also great . my only gripes slow buffer speed when it comes continuous shooting ( 3fps then 1fps ) . once again this camera not ideal sport enthusiast who needs conitinous shots constantly but it still holds it own . i also think they could improved auto-focus tad more ( although 11-point af helps greatly lowlight low contrast situations ) . this camera easy hold long periods time especially compared canon rebel xti model ( which caused my hand cramp up within 5 minutes holding it ) . also , lenses available this camera prices/quality them unmatched . if you want get into serious photography but don't want sell first born , start this !	1
this my my first dlsr . pentax made transition clean effortless k100d . it enough auto features modes make things easy one coming ps plus all control exerienced photgrapher could want . all this it take any mount lens work manual mode any them plus it work fully auto af ones . 18-55mm kit lens big surprise , lotta quality very little cash	1
easy carry lots room your canon cp printers	1
1 . cannot live video capture streaming tripod , since firewire usb interfaces both require handycam station place ( which covers up tripod mounts ) . 2 . transferring video this windows machine terrible . works fine mac , but imovie mac inadequate capturing video use web . capturing video windows nightmare setup ... especially if you use variety computers .	-1
i excited when i received my handy cam . i pictured all niagra falls , ocean city , washington dc , new york etc etc etc .. vedio quality gr8 outdoors it just more than what i want ... indoor video not good .. when you shoot night its not visible if shot night mode every thing comes like 1930 black white , not real . i also used stills they good 1 mb shots . outdoors they you may want them too but indoor or night they useless ... so over all it giving me what i expected it too .. i safely say it met my expectation it performance . not outstanding deal but really worthy deal make .. i recomand this camera people .	-1
although i don't lot experience good binoculars , nikon action extreme impressed me its quality , image brightness , field view , image sharpness . it fairly large binocular tire your arms after extended handheld use . excellent value price	1
i purchased this product put my car deterient possible vandals . it great because it looks like real camera blinking red led light , it make vandals think they monitored . i really like this option spending tons money real camera . plus , you not worry privacy issues because it not real camera . not only , this imitation camera portable so you use it any property	1
i tried digital . i really . but i could never get really gorgeous shots i got my old yashica slr which gave up ghost several years back . i also could not really " focus " what i shooting ... just pointed shot because there no film run out . result ? pointless pics weren't even good looking . digital just didn't feel " right . " so 8 months ago i decided go back film . what get ? after much research , i finally decided canon t2 . absolutely brilliant camera . my favorite feature ? i let camera handle focus , etc . or i go completely manual . may not seem like big deal , but it feels so good control what camera when you want . course , means letting your imagination go ... something sorely lacking digital . couldn't happier no more pointless pics . okay , maybe few , but they still look good . isn't point	1
i got this after switching digital camera . digital cameras didn't offer depth i wanted not proofs big drawback . i am no means expert photography , but i know great photograph when i see one , this camera takes beautiful shots . this beautiful camera . elegant design ; grey body black accents definately attention grabber . people look your camera . it definately brains back up it beauty . loading film easy quick . it 8 or so presets . there automatic " point shoot " mode which you'll probably use most . it automatically compensates light , adjusting shutter speed aperture perfect shot . quick autofocus allows you grab your shot quickly , without waiting camera decide take picture . it also settings portrait shots , close ups , night , landscape , no flash , many others . those settings maximize camera features those particular shot . it also program setting where you program shutter speed , aperture , flash film advance . though comprehensive presets , i don't think you'll ever need use it . 28-90 lens comes kit nice , selector autofocus or manual focus . it also , course , removed so you add other lenses . zoom powerful leads beautiful shots . overall this unbelievable camera . great price , features , pictures best you've ever seen . they very crisp , clear almost 3d lifelike quality them , something i've never seen outside professionally taken photograph . this camera awesome	1
i recently started small photography business doing black white shots kids their natural environment . i wanted camera took quality shots , but still cost effective . i most definitely found it . my cannon takes great shots allows me mobility needed chase kids around . very pleased .	1
i owned canon powershot s-series ( s330 ) , a-series ( a540 , a570is ) s2 . i wanted 28mm wide angle point shoot , so i bought this because canon sd800 outrageously priced . i'm canon fanatic , so prepared multiple comparisons . however this camera worth crossing over panasonic . pros - i definitely enjoy 28mm feature . bright rear display wonderful , os quite intuitive well . also it gets great battery life . ~ 300 shot estimate specs pretty realistic . cons - compared canon cameras this my conclusion - all canon camera much truer white balance presets . even red blue fine tuning options , indoor dim lighting really hard , snow lighting . this camera takes much more saturated contrasty photos than canons . even when fx01 set less-vivid , it way more saturated than canon most vivid setting . end result dramatic unrealistic photo sometimes . ccd noise issue . this camera sensor much noisier than canons ' . nothing dramatic deal-breaking , but don't expect same crisp , clean shots canon take . finally panasonic image stabilization . it really not hold its own against canon . i used 570 handheld shots 1/4 second , sometimes longer , decent results . same goes s2 ( which i highly recommend digital camcorder/super zoom hybrid ) . panasonic sensor doesn't seem match iso standards you set it , it wants slower shutter speeds 2.8 iso 100 than canon set same f-stop iso . so , despite fx01 mega ois , its longer shutter speeds mean you still get shake you wouldn't equivalent canon . i know canon , canon , canon . well , i told you i'm biased . after reading these cons , why would you get this ? it 1/2 price sd 800 ( if you shop around ) it must city photos , big landscapes ( skies look so cool wide angle ) it vital indoor group shots ! buy it , but don't expect world it	-1
good product but color not so attracticed	1
easy get up running , unit goes into slideshow mode after power automatically . picture quality excellent . easy put pictures memory card them show up . recommend re-cropping your pictures 16x9 aspect ratio so you get full picture . unit accomodate std . 4x6 format well , but not fill screen . small quirks : - when slideshow mode , you can't hit pause button zoom . - very poorly designed stand collapse after couple weeks . - documentation lacking ( typical coby style ) - no support quicktime video popular some digital cameras - unit faint lingering glow screen after power down which doesn't go away unless you unplug unit	-1
i'm like most people digital camera . i take bazillion pictures , develop 10% onto paper , then banish other 90% computer storage archives . i mean , i'd love display lot more those pictures my computer , but who wall space or time organize all those prints ? that why i decided get digital picture frame . i looking quite some time , but always turned off small-ish lcd sizes or poor resolutions . then i came across this coby 10 " widescreen unit , 800x480 pixel display ! there no reviews amazon ( time ) , but spec-wise it what i wanted ; larger display higher resolution . i took chance ordered one am i glad i ! display huge , pictures look crisp . colors pretty accurate when compared my calibrated lcd computer monitor . interchangeable frames ( it comes black one well white one ) make it easy match your d�cor . litte remote easy use , but easy lose well , so make sure you place it somewhere easy find . built-in mp3 player nice touch . speakers aren't great ( it picture frame after all ) , but it nice frame play music while slideshow mode . there variety transition effects choose . i haven't tried playing videos it , so i can't comment feature . said , there few things prevent me giving this 5 stars . 1 . adjustable stand made cheap feeling plastic . i've seen other frames much nicer backs . yes , i know it front you looking , but stand should sturdier , my opinion . 2 . angle stand , while adjustable , simply held place friction . it actually one setting it click into , but then it angled too much view normal position . 3 . there seems software bug causes display act weird slideshow mode . well , more precise , if you slideshow mode you choose either fade , mask , or cross comb transition effects , then very top horizontal pixel line starts show black sections . it looks like dead pixels , but once you exit slideshow ( or use other effects other than then ones i listed ) everything fine . i recreated this problem , but i don't know if it just my frame or all these . no biggie . i now use no transition effects it perfect . 4 . this not really complaint product but more coby specs . their website they state lcd 800x480 . great ! so i ordered frame then resized whole bunch pictures resolution . however , when i got frame started using it , i noticed all my pictures black ( blank ) bars both left right sides picture . it turns out resolution actually 860x480 ( which i found out after some trial-and-error ) . it would nice know this ahead time save me re-resize my pictures . plus , sizing pictures 860x480 really weird ratio ... kinda like getting 4x7 prints . i ordered this total electronics ( one amazon vendors ) it arrived quickly . when i reported " dead pixel " problem ( which turned out software bug , not defect , so speak ) , they responded my email quickly offered take it back no questions asked . now that customer service ! overall , i am very pleased this product . reality , it rates 4.5 stars . i'm type person agonizes over something before finally buying it . this purchase , totally unncessary !	-1
i got this little thing 2 months ago my birthday , am quite happy it . i took it me vacation japan , able take home tons picture memories . i'll start cons : 1 ) you hold it still several seconds when taking pictures , or else they turn out blurry . this only real problem when taking spur-of-the-moment pictures , or if hurry , which not happen too often . 2 ) flash extremely bright , so close objects wash out . ( just turn off flash this not problem)3 ) digital zoom - not good optical , but not too bad . now pros : 1 ) this thing small ! it came neckstrap , so i wore it necklace during my vacation , it so light i barely noticed it . 2 ) lots memory- my 512mb card holds least 530 pictures/videos , there still room . 3 ) really easy operate , i able change flash settings , delete pictures , use self-timer , take video review pictures without even read instruction manuel . 4 ) quick easy file transfer my computer-just hook it up usb , drag drop . 5 ) extrememly bright flash , while listed con , also nice when taking pictures dark , they show up if it middle day , provided you not too close . overall , i gotta say i love this little camera . sure , picture quality isn't best , but if you decent lighting conditions , you hold still few seconds , you get some good quality pictures	-1
this my first time buy things online , but i think that great . it very easy use , very light . i think i like it	1
everio gzmg27 hdd camcorder wonderful camcorder lots handy features value price . although battery comes camcorder limited life , i didn't feel this huge drawback since i always like buy spare anyway . 20 gb capacity seems more than adequate it easy transfer other storage media . zoom feature powerful enough bring out flaws face hollywood star automatic shooting mode allows you start taking good videos straight box	1
this wide angle lens works better than i expected . i bought this my sony hc-96 . it increases field 30% . i able sit front row children musical still fit all kids stage frame . i expected edge distortion but it not noticeable unless you carefully look it . i suspect it interferes autofocus times during zooming focus seems fluctuate little bit high zoom . it useful tight quarters when you need wide angle shot	-1

i'm not professional photographer or even serious amateur , though i take thousands photos . i bought a620 8 months ago because i wanted something small but good go my much larger new nikon d50 . both cameras replacing old 3 mp fujifilm minolta film slr . we took a620 d50 major trip canadian rockies several u.s. national parks . d50 my " default " camera trip -- frankly , i afraid " risk " shots a620 , especially since there many times when i needed wider-angle lens than a620 provides . then , one afternoon , top mountain jasper spectacular panoramic view , d50 battery ran down . i crestfallen , forced use a620 . rest afternoon , i worried fretted how one major highlights our trip wouldn't captured well a620 . well , make long story short , several weeks later i uploaded all our photos d50 a620 , ones a620 top mountain better ! i amazed -- nicer color , sharper , just plain better ! now i totally trust a620 actually use it far more than d50 because it lot easier take . i still prefer d50 indoor flash shots--there lot red-eye a620 -- but i say , if i'd bought a620 before d50 given it good test run , i don't think i would bought d50 , even though i really like it . sometimes portability much more important than you think it going . i got a620 brand new under $200 -- it great deal great camera . i think it especially good people like me who aren't likely delve into all intricacies settings , etc ., but still take lot photos want them look great . what i've read other reviews , though , both here other sites , this very nice camera more advanced photographers well . good job , canon ! next my wishlist : something similar this camera but wider-angle lens longer telephoto ... , course , less red-eye flash !	1

purchased this unit new $160 . good performance - little practice , getting readings well over 800 yards , even bright sunlight . also like fact it uses standard aaa cells . housing design leaves bit desired - it bulky , battery cover not very secure . see losing cover easily . not ergonomic more recent models . overall , $160 rangefinder genuine 800 yard performance , good deal	-1

this camera deserves 5 stars if you need camera easily fits your pocket or purse ready use whenever picture or movie moment arrives , even under water . considering varied picture taking situations , action , lighting conditions , performance beyond my expectations . only significant limitation seeing display bright sunlight or under water , even when screen set its brightest . however , aiming intuitive enough i never missed shot i able change modes even under water ( but i practice switching underwater wide 2 movie ahead time ) . one feature would improvement would ability zoom while taking movie . i received this camera just couple days before leaving cruise so i didn't any time practice it . careful not your finger front lens , especially under water where you may not watching screen . also aware when you zoom movies image movement also magnified . wide angle underwater movies much better than full optical zoom ( digital zoom off ) . after couple days controls easy use change modes review pictures movies . i used 1 gig cards highest resolution which provided 240 pictures or 40 minutes movies . switching back forth easy . movie recording continue until card full or battery runs out , not just short clips . my clips too short until i comfortable i would not quickly fill up memory card or run out battery . under water pictures superb natural shift color toward green . i recharged battery every other night . battery able take 100 pictures 15 minutes movie recharges . i recommend spare battery it indicate it getting low couple times ran out once . camera also used daylight , inside , without flash , even night shots ( auto setting better than night scene harbor lights night . camera steadied railing ) . i purchased lanyard metal clasp sports authority dollar which provides very secure leash . lanyard around my neck i could tuck camera my shirt pocket . i always ready next picture opportunity without worrying dropping it . i'm very pleased picture quality although it may not match camera much larger lens system , but it great able take pictures movies when i would not my larger camera available . 15 fps movies not match 3ccd digital video camera , but they acceptable . i even recorded short clips during live theater performances ( screen brightness set its minimum ) i pleased quality this tiny camera .	1
this one best pointshoot camera , auto focus works perfectly fine , it just requires little practice . night shot picture quality unbelievable . very sharp natural colors big zoom . i would highly recommend this camera , just spend little time learn how get steady green light(focus ) you good go	1
i owned canon powershot s-series ( s330 ) , a-series ( a540 , a570is ) s2 . i wanted 28mm wide angle point shoot , so i bought this because canon sd800 outrageously priced . i'm canon fanatic , so prepared multiple comparisons . however this camera worth crossing over panasonic . pros - i definitely enjoy 28mm feature . bright rear display wonderful , os quite intuitive well . also it gets great battery life . ~ 300 shot estimate specs pretty realistic . cons - compared canon cameras this my conclusion - all canon camera much truer white balance presets . even red blue fine tuning options , indoor dim lighting really hard , snow lighting . this camera takes much more saturated contrasty photos than canons . even when fx01 set less-vivid , it way more saturated than canon most vivid setting . end result dramatic unrealistic photo sometimes . ccd noise issue . this camera sensor much noisier than canons ' . nothing dramatic deal-breaking , but don't expect same crisp , clean shots canon take . finally panasonic image stabilization . it really not hold its own against canon . i used 570 handheld shots 1/4 second , sometimes longer , decent results . same goes s2 ( which i highly recommend digital camcorder/super zoom hybrid ) . panasonic sensor doesn't seem match iso standards you set it , it wants slower shutter speeds 2.8 iso 100 than canon set same f-stop iso . so , despite fx01 mega ois , its longer shutter speeds mean you still get shake you wouldn't equivalent canon . i know canon , canon , canon . well , i told you i'm biased . after reading these cons , why would you get this ? it 1/2 price sd 800 ( if you shop around ) it must city photos , big landscapes ( skies look so cool wide angle ) it vital indoor group shots ! buy it , but don't expect world it	-1
this my fifth digital camera , i like it best far . it also cheapest . it my first wide-angle my first silver-not-black : someone else said , i don't see how i would ever go back non-wide-angle after this ; but i wish mine black . i noticed colors faded fluorescent light , but macro it excellent -- much better than more expensive camera i already bought macro purposes ( canon . ) i also love battery , which seems last forever . i bought replacement lenmar battery which also great , cheap , but it got some bad reviews because it described wrong model camera , not fx-01 . ( if you read customer reviews , you figure out which one right one you . ) i problems understanding display , which shows options don't correspond any place camera you select options . ( i guess i should look manual . ) also , i don't like software decided not download it all . i bought this because i wanted camera made computer company much camera company , , i wanted it work . also , someone sent me email history leica , how they saved lot jews concentration camps . other nice thing this camera i use it lot more because i carry it me every day : it tiny battery always works , so why not ? graininess , my desktop pics look fine , i would not raving this camera if it not very easy take good pics -- but i admit i haven't used it printed pics so far	1
great camera , just chosen editor choice pc mag well . [ ... ] i it 3 weeks now , couple family parties later i am really happy this little one . fits even tight jeans pockets , quick take pictures . face recognition works really well , not flawless , but really amazing . i took 300 shots so far they mostly great quality , some indoor pictures without flash bit blurry , if you don't hold it steady . my 4 year old niece running around it took nice shots just her own automatic setting , pretty amazing . flash bit strong when close indoors . it takes fast pictures very easy understand . i still read manual , though . ;-) i added fast 2gb card even video quality pretty good , althought just avi format , not mpg . sound great . it even speaker when you play video review . outside pictures outstanding quality . i some outside self-timer family pictures enlarged store 20-30cm , picture quality awesome . highly recommended when you want camera you carry you all times	1
i all sorts research sd600 . i made up my mind sd600 camera me . sd1000 newer kid block therefore not many reviews . why i am here today . sd1000 newest version sd600 few additions . those few additions make this camera awesome . i love iso choices . i zooming my local calif . freeways around 80mph decided take few shots passing signs out my passenger window . high speed iso caught such great detail i could clearly read sign later home . means despite small size camera filtered out shake my hand , shake road , compensated fast movement . color options very much same other canon powershot models . macro so much fun play this camera . button layout easy figure out . lighting options like white balance button push away . face detection option you sure get great photo family . i playing it none stop over week . get least gig memory . only downside i found , it minor one , when battery warning comes it means you 1-2 more pics then it shuts off . i ordered battery ahead time it worth it . batteries charge 30-40mins . this great camera . if you thinking sd600 step up get sd1000 . you not disappointed it	1
this pretty good camera , loaded lots features . pros include 10x optical zoom , use sd card , battery consumption . also , this camera you ability buy add-ons such zoom lenses such - makes it nice those just past beginner experience . there couple cons i've found , most important picture quality . although it capability take great photos , you make sure wait several seconds shots ensure they'll come out looking great ( my opinion , anyway ) . size okay , although it kinda bulky so small . i prefer something size also slim - it not so easy carry around because this . overall , this camera very easy use	-1
this camera i use it works great ! i surprised how well it records video too ! it very easy adjust camera environment you photographings . zoom excellent doesn't seem drain batteries much . i would recommend this camera amateur or professional .	1
this only camera you ever need ! i mine 1.5 years not only pictures great but i use 2gb memory card video quality amazing !!! i take video , load unto my computer dvd family watch less than hour ( if you can't wait just plug cord hookup your tv watch video straight camera ) . i retired my digital sony handycam ( which great video camera ) . i used this camera extensively 1.5 years traveling china , europe us - no problems - friends family amazed quality pictures	1
so far tripod served me very well . light , full height adjustments , quite stable its weight	1

price i paid it , this lense best zoom lense any nikon photographer shold . i picked this one ( over 70-300mm nikon lense ) it fully complimented my nikon d50 18-55 lense . i using it outside make photos my son swimming polo game i couldn't understand what other reviewers saying this lense slow stopping action . i able freeze actions game each water splashes then ball flying hitting water surface . i am hightly recommending this lense	1
lens exactly what it supposed . quality high , price competitive . i am very satisfied it	-1
this great little helper if you plan your camera around your neck long period time want some protection . it not easiest thing get into , expecially lens , so i wouldn't this my camera if i thought i would need quick shot . but if you're hiking ( taking some time setting up most your shots ) this nice alternative keep your camera protective backpack whole time . worth money , well made , but not " easy , easy out "	-1
first off , let me make it clear i am satisfied this camera . i it 8 months now i put it through its paces its held up fine . but there few things you must know : camera no zoom . i mean , practically no zoom . 2.2 may look decent but its pointless any real-life situation . you find yourself moving lot your camera get better shot , not standing one place using zoom feature . you never get close wide shot - its just not possible this camera . this camera great average stills but that it . you click twice take picture or " press halfway then fully " according manual . this major pain . sometimes when battery weak , it may take lot time take picture ( lot frustration ) , so this not cam capture any special pictures or " kodak moments " . apart these cons , camera great value money offers video all kinds stuff . if you're looking mostly looking take landscape or portrait stills , this camera good job	-1
i gave this camera 5 stars because it awesome features . this camera perfect size kids you put video this camera . i love this camera . i think it takes awesome pictures	1
just what i needed my camera . just like sony make something isnt universal	1
i bought this camera case my dscw5 , it perfect fit camera . it sturdy enough it protect but soft enough carry easily your person . great case money , i recommend it	-1
i am professional photographer . i looked around many cases decided qbp-3 myself . i use this case times i don't want drag around my full slr kit . it very nice size . case accept my panasonic dmc-lx1 digicam , 60gb video ipod w/earphones , 2 additional sd memory cards , spare battery , still little room left lens cloth my license or credit cards/cash . it made hold small/medium digicam main compartment . if you smaller digicam like lx1 , sony series , casio exlim , or pentax optio there enough room left ipod . it construction means there padding camera my ipod so neither gets scratched . there also pass-through slot top case digicams " hand-strap " . what makes this case work ipod quite well because it perfect headphone pass-through , just make sure you remote . back pocket nice webbing pockets made memory chips . it also larger size zippered interior pocket misc flat stuff . exterior there snap open belt clip over three inches tall uses elastic allow little play what fits beneath it . back front case constructed reinforced " armored " ballistic nylon quite durable so far . center area just plain heavy duty ballistic nylon , but still what i would consider very strong . this case ideal me use run around . i purchase this after looking cases lowepro , tenba , quantray , domke , tamrac . i still didn't find case fit small digicam well this one .	1
after little work camera measurements ( i lumix dmc-f27 ) i decided tamrac 5696 just could perfect bag . this turned out correct . there just enough room camera few accessories . it very easy carry treats camera quite well . i wouldn't want smaller or larger bag . it very well made easy use . i'm very pleased bag overall	1
i shopping my digital zoom camera idea digital camera zoom wouldn't collapse enough fit into bag never occurred me . but , that what happened . upon receiving my panasonic , dmc-fz20 , i surprise how light it yet how big it . those shopping bag which hold one slr w/lens this great bag ! i've purchased other tamrac digital series bags satisfaction . material quality , craftsmanship , design all excellent . this bag hold-up world travel various family outings . but , if you more than one lens , flash , or want hold battery charger ( or loads spare film ) this container too small ! tamrac makes such good product i'm replacing this digital-6 system-3 unit . only note caution : when purchasing parts bag ( any bag ) use tape measure , arrange you parts , then measure them typical configuration , use " real " dimensions shop bag ( take note inner outer dimensions some bags padded there space loss when bag arrives ) .	-1

this one best bargains i've seen , " essentially " you get 3 filters price one . image quality these filters great , 812 ( warming ) filter far favorite giving back color richness flash photography so often washes out , unless you patience constantly tweaking your flash power . aside 812 uv protector basically clear protective filter . while it obviously advantages over clear glass , i tend not think it any different . this too great filter which i use half time because it doesn't affect color hues or change stop values too greatly while it takes worry out carrying camera around ready any candid shots may occur . finally included circular polarizer . this filter adjusts amount uv light entering camera spinning filter direction uv rays entering ( or turning thingy till things look better ) . this lens great sunny days take surface glare off lakes glass making them transparent again . it also makes colors more crisp general when photographing buildings other large " reflective " man-made things . so things sound great so far , but now why i only give this item 4 stars . while tiffen known one best photo video filters , they quality control issues no live up thier reputation . my case 812 filter arrived discoloration glass . while it didn't hurt image quality , flaw towards edge filter , i none less didn't want find situation which flaw would diminish quality . seeing it not amazon fault my first e-mail went tiffen replacement which they said they would gladly , but only after i send them filter they recieve it would they ship my replacement ( not option my circumstances ) . instead amazon wonderful customer service shown through again , within 3 days they replaced entire set . second set arrivided without flaw but since my other two filters perfect condition i traded just 812 . i havn't any other issues i'm very satisfied my filters . only other word warning would circular polorizer . while i recieved 2 flawless occassionally i read reviews customers received ones assembled backwards making lens useless . quick way check see if your cp working correctly hold it , thread facing yourself , look lcd monitor or tv spin it until picture dissapears(obviously working correctly ) . i still wouldn't pass up this deal knowing what i now , chances everything show up perfectly but none less if you're concerned order it before you need it check everything over carefully . amazon always best returns often ship replacement next day overnight shipping . little further insight ... i recently doing some black white film photography , decided use my 812 warming filter protective lens i carrying 3 lenses me . just thought i would mention using this filter produce " white " sky some outdoor photographs . shots taken gradient blue sky which entirety showed up white , even bracketed sets , should shown something one series . while itself interesting effect some shots , it mostly just caused me frustration darkroom . i just wanted add this fair warning . i discovered this accident , so i don't know if it applies all sky conditions i didn't lot bw sky shots , i might test it using photoshop later i see they 812s effect built . anyways , good luck fun photoing	1
i'm fifteen years old , photography major hobby mine already . i using my father way-out-of-date 2.1 megapixel camera 2 years , wanted upgrade better camera . when i searching , this not my list cameras buy . i looking ones such much more slim sony cyber shot dsc-w5 . i made sure give my mom list all ones i wanted , since christmas approaching fast . when i opened my gifts found z700 , i wasn't sure what think , i admit i may bit ungrateful . package , it appeared clumsy hold , because since i'm left-handed i tend take pictures up-side-down so i hold camera my left hand . design this prohibited me doing , because grip side bit awkward manufactured right hands . it also appeared really bulky against other cameras i've seen , because grip plus how far lense zooms out makes it big camera compared others . it also runs normal batteries , but it cannot use alkaline . they last all 5 shots . you buy either special batteries kodak , or lithium batteries , both which extremely expensive . my first few uses , it hard getting used large design , lcd screen smaller than i expected well . after month or two , i started getting used it . once i got past size , i realized it takes very crisp pictures . digital zoom useless because it adds pixelation , but normal zoom very good itself . lcd pretty much washes out bright light , but viewfinder very helpful . same happens low light . it lot settings found useful , such night portrait , night landscape , text documents , self-portrait . sports setting also useful . it hard focus closeup stuff auto mode , but self-portrait option takes care any closeup stuff . it also heavy camera , which makes it feel lot more sturdy than some lightweight aluminum cameras now . dial little hard turn , buttons little hard press , but everything really easy figure out , you'll taking great pictures no time	-1
winning combo ! 4mp digital camera takes vivid pictures allow clear enlargements up 11 " 14 " . 5x optical zoom lets you get little closer look than most 3x optical zoom digital cameras . neatest feature this camera built-in lens cap automatically shields lens when camera turned off . kodak digital cameras #1 ease use reason - they point-and-shoot simple everyday users , but extra settings tweak if you want more specific control . this camera take compressed video clips depending size your memory card . you want purchase larger sd memory card than what included package . included cords , you hook camera up tv view pictures you taken or it display live view . this indispensible if you babysitting . kids love see themselves tv ! printer dock series 3 lets you dock camera recharge batteries , print pictures , one-touch transfer pictures computer touch-up or emailing . you don't need computer print pictures . it print 4 6 " or smaller multiples picture . photo paper cartridge refills available online or most large retailers . they aren't cheap , but it lets you your own photo lab home . hard beat amazon price . camera + printer dock = pictures , prints , battery charger , computer interface .	1
this great , fun camera . just load film shoot . it easy use easy sneak up your subject because theirs no focusing fooling it . you use camera one hand , including turning wheel next frame . worth low price	1
this lens good way extend capabilities general purpose camera amature photographer . overall all quality color accuracy digital images good . large lens diameter blocks view finder , forcing one rely lcd screen framing . camera sometimes gets confused during action shots taking longer than normal auto focus - minor inconvenience . lens requires adapter - seperate piece keep track .	-1
i never thought i would brag point shoot camera , but canon g6 remarkable . , add-on lens equally suprising . granted , this not interchangeable slr lens , but it great use all subjects one would shoot this camera . i am glad i chose canon brand lens . note : i use lensmate adapter .	-1

i bought this camera almost year ago before i went trip italy ... i kind worried it because i never slr before , but i really wanted one , i wanted make sure i didn't cheap looking pictures my trip which i often before . it worked perfectly ! i only got chance use one roll film it before i went , but all pictures came out great ! i just love this camera , i still use it all time . i am learning all features , like how use bulb setting . i used it 4th july fireworks , they also came out wonderfully . i would highly recommend this camera	1

my first professional digital slr nikon d1x . i got great pictures it but it too large heavy lug around extended periods . i also some issues its operation . but now , nikon seems solved my issues d200 . i purchased dedicated sb-800 flash 18-200 lens recommended d200 manual . whole system much improved over my other digital slr . both focus metering seem work more reliably . it works better available light . optical anti-vibration aids overall picture sharpness ( plus those us who not rock-steady ) . i am getting use button sequence required enlarge picture preview really like amount magnification possible . menuing system seems quite extensive well-organized . i would like more latitude picture quality settings ( e.g. contract , saturation , sharpness ) . help screens really tell me something when i'm confused . i appreciate " modeling " feature . it useful when attempting compose dark situation . it also lets me see reflections before they committed picture . unfortunately this feature not work using built-in flash . i wish nikon could add some type lock continuous-single-manual focus selector front camera . my finger seems move switch unknowingly . i would appreciate battery charger built plug rather than detachable cord . person who still wears thick glasses , i wish nikon could make viewfinder more like one their old n8008 . or maybe it time away pentaprisoms mechanical mirrors give us truly pro camera mimics high-end pro-sumer models electronic viewfinders adjustable view screens	-1
i'm glad i purchased this accessory kit my new canon s80 -- extra long lanyard allows one carry camera easily accessible way while hiking . second battery invaluable . case leather fits snuggly -- it useful protecting camera when it carried purse or backpack , but i am finding i set it aside when i'm move taking pix	-1

this amazing deal works great it not take long batteries charg	1
please note since there already many user reviews written , this may not seem like much " review " , but i thought i would touch few things i wondering myself before buying camera case it might help someone else . this hard drive-based camcorder wonderful . well jvc ! i going buy next model up , mg70 , but since i don't use it photos , i don't believe i would benefit increased megapixel ccd . besides , mg70 only 10x optical zoom , missing video light 1.2 bright lens . i'm happy mg50 . case you haven't noticed , this camcorder no viewfinder so you must use flip-out lcd screen . video quality : hard drive feature brilliant ! only quality level you should avoid econo ( 37 hr mode ) , since it reduces resolution half also records only 15 frames per second . ultra-fine ( 7.25 hrs ) best , but i couldn't notice much difference when i lowered quality level fine ( 10 hrs ) or normal ( 14 hrs ) . highest 3 modes ( ultra fine , fine , normal ) , camera records full 720x480 resolution . far i tell , it really sampling many lines resolution . other digital camcorders i've used ( mini-dv ) very noticable " stair-step jaggies " parts picture , especially borders high-contrast elements picture . this hard drive camera , however , resolution significantly higher these jagged lines ( aliasing ) rarely noticeable all , if ever . how camera records files onto hard drive : it creates new . mod file ( it mpeg-2 video file dolby digital audio ) every time you start/stop recording . so , all your clips conveniently seperated , but course you combine them your video editing software later if you prefer . camera record 12 hrs continuously if needed , but create new . mod file every 4gb footage . you may read other reviews following trick : rename . mod files camera records . mpg increased compatibility . well , i tried it it works like charm , regardless whether your video footage 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratio . this makes it easy use your favorite dvd-burning or video editing software this camera , well ensuring future compatibility . i haven't found even one program couldn't play files perfectly after i renamed them . even windows media player 9 no problem . if you leave them . mod , then you won't find many programs support it ( least not yet ) . only ones i found one came camera ( cyberlink ) , adobe premiere elements 2 . one thing i should mention files camera saves . it numbers them hexadecimal ( 1-9 then a-f ( eg . mov009 , then mov00a ... )) , so some people may find this bit annoying . also , my windows xp computer alphabetizes files a-z , then 0-9 , so they end up displayed wrong order . i'm not sure why my computer doing this don't know if all windows xp computers it ( it worked fine my windows 2000 computer ) , but you always list them chronological order if you need correct this . i believe most video editing software , however , list files correct alphanumeric order ( 1-9 then a-z ) . mine all . camera handy feature called " file# reset " . every time you activate this , it creates new folder hard drive begins saving all future clips into it . this handy way seperate your recorded " events " , case you tend fill up hard drive before copying it your computer , you may months worth footage camera . so you your daughter birthday party one folder , your trip zoo , etc ... playback : playback sequential clips camera ( either lcd or onto tv ) seamless . there no pause scenes - it plays back just like tape would clean cuts recordings . also , you locate specific clips viewing thumbnail images ( 9 per screen ) or listing recording date . then , course , after playing back clips , there no need fast forward tape back next available blank part recording . when you go record again , camera not overwrite previous material . camera allows limited editing ( deleting or rearranging clips ) . also , case you delete lot clips then continue recording , hard drive may eventually become fragmented . camera handy utility built defragment hard drive . i haven't used it myself because i haven't needed it , but it nice know it there . low light performance this camera isn't best i've seen , but it still pretty good such small camera . my previous camera jvc well ( mini dv - only 3 years old ) . it slightly brighter low light , however , i find this hard drive jvc camera much better autofocus performance low light or fast movements . all recent jvc cameras ( including this mg50 ) " night alive " mode which reduces shutter speed 1/2 second . this useless unless your camera tripod your subject not moving all . you might well take picture then ... however , mg50 adjustable shutter speeds well . i find it useful low light situations change shutter speed 1/15 sec . this brightens image considerably . it reduce motion blur if things moving too fast , but i still consider it reasonable trade-off amount extra brightness scene . built-in light useful under some situations . aware effective range light only 3-5 feet , so unless your subject within range , light won't make any difference . it it useful moments though ( like filming pet floor dimly lit room ) also , using light consumes less than 10% more power because it led , but course that also reason why it not very bright . photos : image quality still photos , my opinion , terrible . not only resolution inadequate most uses , it extremely difficult depress shutter button without shaking camera blurring image . start/stop button ( doubles shutter release button photo mode ) quite stiff . startup time : this camera poor startup time , but i guess that expected it hard drive camera . completely off position , it takes 10 full seconds ( based my own tests ) before you actually begin recording . even this only double typical startup time mini-dv camera , it might mean you'll miss special moment you're trying record . even if camera record-standby mode , it still takes 3 seconds time you press start/stop button until camera actually recording . camera noise : camera produce faint hum while hard drive spinning , but i found this less noticeable recording than sound tape machanism 3 mini-dv camcorders i've used . course , some mechanical noise expected compact cameras like this one . without external mic , it unavoidable . unfortunately this camera , you cannot connect external mic . zooming motor also slightly noticeable , but no more than other similar-sized camcorders . besides , unkless you're completely quiet situation these sounds won't even issue all you . lens cap : lens cap stays place nicely . since it only covers lens itself doesn't extend any further than it needs , it tends stay place ( unlike other cameras i've where lens cap pops off while inserting/removing it bag or pocket ) . drop detection : you may read this camera feature senses freefall or other motion could potentially damage hard drive , automatically shuts camera off . well , just so you know , there option camera turn this feature off , case you want make video your favorite rollercoaster . i'm not saying i recommend this , but i just thought i'd mention it . i myself not personally witnessed this feature work yet , but then again i haven't tried dropping it ! overall , i highly recommend this camcorder casual videographer ( great vacations ! ) . it seems really stand up competing cameras it class most points . however , if you're more serious videographer you might want consider larger , 3-ccd camera bright light external mic . otherwise , fun ! i gave this review only 4 stars because these few issues : lack viewfinder , slow startup time , poor image quality still photos	-1

if you serious your videography , then you need able charge your batteries using something other than supplied " through camera " method . i suppose if you purchase enough extra batteries you might not need this , but i still don't like plugging my camera just keep battery charged . even high end hd sony , there not separate way charge batteries , limits you if you lots video . this one best most complete charging solutions i seen . i highly recommend it	1
i this over 6 months now i cant really complain it . its compact easy use . however , people glasses would trouble using it . i use it without my glasses(there power caliberation you match ur eye power ) then its very clear . easy carry around solid . very good its price	-1
