leaking , slipping , can't use over kitchen sink . horrible design .	-1
i bought this because i love all other fisher price aquarium stuff we . but ... we haven't thrilled this tub . hammock only used until baby 10 lbs if i'm remembering correctly -- well our child over 9 lbs birth ... so she used it like 2 weeks . even so , hammock sags onto this hard bump middle hammock so baby back rests this bump . never seemed comfortable . then we used it hammock attached only top like instructions say but our daughter outgrew infant side because her butt would slide right over bump supposed support her but she can't sit up use other side . there better tubs out there	-1
i bought this chair because great reviews , i hesitated spending so much , but figured all features would worth it considering my son would using it couple years . pros : i like i roll it around table , or sink clean up after meals . height adjustment easy convenient . cons : folding it up didn't quite work i thought it would . it didn't lock into folding postition ... didn't really save much space . i would prop it against wall , hope no one knocked it down . we finally stopped folding it up . toys connect tray too dangerous my son , he would usually hit himself face them when he younger , time he older , i didn't really need them . battery operated toy funny smell it whenever it running while . he like it ... but buttons too hard him press when he younger . my son discovered 7 months how pull off extra tray go into dishwasher , so we don't use . he 13 months now , last week discovered how disconnect tray itself fling it off high chair . i washed seat cover per instructions , half time not use dryer , even though it said it could go into dryer , now seat bubling cracking ... i place cloth diaper seat protect my son legs . if i not spent $90.00 chair i would not disappointed ... but he only used it 7 months .	-1
we nothing but problems receiver . we it our kitchen it no more than 30 feet our son bedroom . any time we walk near receiver it beeps loss signal . beep very annoying because it won't stop until you move out way . if we open fridge door it beeps also . we've tried all frequency combinations no luck . it also very subsceptible interference makes loud crackling sounds , even low volume , until you change frequency . when it works sound quality very good , although it hard lower volume enough so night you not awakened your child simply rolling over or babbling their sleep . we recommend angelcare movement sensor monitor bebe sounds . sound quality great it comes sensor pad you place under your baby mattress . it senses each time your baby takes breath . if there no movement it sounds alarm . great insurance against sids !	-1
alas , we entire locomotion set but cute little mobile won't fit our sleigh-style crib . i called babies us see some sort conversion kit , but there no such thing . i'll returning it this weekend getting some crib toys instead . : -	-1

i wore baby plus my first pregnancy . i say our child bright , out-going 8 month old now , but beginning she colicky terrible napper ! i thought this brilliant idea , but began realize many bright , gifted children i know didn't exposure this system . it loud wear not so comfortable . you instructed wear it hour time quite maddening . good luck if you choose purchase , but just think , einstein fine out one	-1
leak-o-matic fully lived up its name . new parent , i don't time things once , forget doing things twice . i need simple reliable- leak-o-matic neither . it worked ok first few times , then i partially filled tub put all items nearby necessary bathtime . time i returned baby hand , leak-o-matic dribbled all over laundry room counter , soaked all my other items counter , water ran down onto floor , under baseboard , dripped upstairs landing onto downstairs foyer floor . leak-o-matic hindenburg all baby bathtubs . it too bad i cannot give it zero stars . there many people who say you just assemble them correctly , but judging number irate mommies here , i conclude it either too complicated design or just plain crappy engineering . think it- number people young children who took time go online tell everyone this thing piece cheese ! cups feet stick countertop so you unable positon tub once it attached . fabric mesh incline allows baby slide down into water , so you're always repositioning baby . i'm surprised this thing didn't come built toaster ' added safety ' . i not research every single item registry- i figured if big stores carried it then it must least " ok " . back it goes . if you buy this thing , then good luck you , don't burn toast !	-1
i bought this item my daughter it not worth money . items cheap plastic some even cardboard . this would great deal if offered dollar store . pass	-1
my almost- 3 yr old daughter needed new umbrella stroller ( she tall , but still gets tired sometimes , especially if i take her shopping ) . i researched options picked maclaren volo . my first stroller before it chicco capri , it always bumped against my legs , which annoying uncomfortable . when canopy broke , i got rid it decided buying new one plane travel local outings . volo seemed great - light , handsome , convenient , highly rated parents . i ordered stroller , upon unpacking it , quite pleased its appearance . i read instructions learned use it . stroller seemed sturdy , well-made , easy maneuver , not mention chic . washable seat good idea , i thought . i liked how large it ( perfect older child ) , how easily it moved . when i took new volo around block , i noticed one double back wheels not aligned properly ( one higher than other not rotate , which caused stroller make scraping sound ) . then other set stopped rotating when one (!) pine needle got stuck it ! i carefully remove it my hands middle street . needless say , that not quality i expected , since every parent i know raved maclaren . canopy kept sliding off rails , well - something you would not want airport , your toddler luggage car seat tow . when i got home , i looked wheels closely tried adjust them , but no avail . they flimsy ( i could dent them my finger if i wanted ! ) , way too small just poorly designed . i immediately packed up stroller returned it amazon . i very disappointed . one would think such high price , wheels would usable - after all , they most important feature any stroller . i stay chicco order c6 . least i know wheels great , you can't beat price	-1
i bought this seat my fifth child . she loved it first , but then second week we it , plastic top one legs snapped i putting her it . luckily i not let go her yet , because whole thing fell apart floor . rattle ball also broke off within first couple weeks . upon investigation , company only offers 15 day warranty not cover " material failure " . i not buy anything else this company . not only their products poor they down right dangerous	-1
all things we heard it suffocation hazard later age , it actually potential even very beginning . our little one actually used slide down it night progressed , leaving her wedges time she would wake . we tried tightening it her much possible , she still scooted down it . after few too many attempts this we stopped using it altogether . maybe our baby just too squiggly , but honestly i just found it dangerous . i think it great idea , but product needs some work .	-1
i read several reviews this site choose new mattress my babies room . i great crib usa baby i noticed how first review stated she didn't buy super expensive mattress usa baby ( 160.00 ) which i my first baby it great . it super snug fit crib now her toddler bed it still perfect fit . i decided this baby i didn't want spend much mattress because it seem silly . however , this mattress didn't fit snug my crib nor it firm feel . this medium quality mattress medium price . i bought it yesterday took it back today . i am going go expensive mattress i know fits perfect long term use .	-1
this monitor awful . i it 5 months it only worked properly 1 . it makes loud beeping noises oddest times , like 2 am !!! not buy this monitor . onlt thing it going it nice looking !!!	-1
this worst monitor we ever , we several our kids . it says range 600 feet , but it doesn't even reach 200 . our cordless phone reaches twice distance . light makes it very annoying night . it beeps loudly no reason cuts out frequently !	-1
i agree rebecca -- bravados more simple , more flexible , more comfortable	-1
i like idea all this one case ( it hard complain this price ) , but some these things would better bought separately . we've either traded up or found substitute most things here . here what i found : item #1 ) case fine , but things fall out all time . #2 ) i haven't used tweezers yet , but magnifying part sounds nice . #3 ) nail clippers way too sharp . we cut my daughter skin more than once ( but one serious enough we considered hospital trip ! ) now we use my regular clippers , i haven't gotten her skin since . soft grip thing actually make them slide around more , so it tougher cut where you wanted . trust me , it easy clip skin fingers little ! #4 -7 ) emery boards very handy , but any emery boards would work . #8 ) we got different thermometer ; this one too slow . faster ones more expensive , but they're worth it sick squirmy baby . #9 ) i haven't used medicine dropper , but one time she need one , i actually asked pharmacy desk grocery store , they gave me one free ( then later i found out we this one . ) #10 -11 ) brush comb nice . i'm sure they purchased separately kit less . #12 ) my daughter only 7 months old , no need toothbrush awhile , since there no teeth ( even when there , i believe you wipe them gauze , not toothbrush awhile . ) basically , although this kit tons things could helpful it wasn't very expensive , we either gotten upgrade things we use ( thermometer ) , or found other things would work just well ( regular nail clippers , free medicine dropper . ) i'm certainly not saying you shouldn't get one , because i'd hate say then you find you needed it . if you get it shower gift , great ; if not , you find substitute items just easily	-1
nail clippers , hairbrush , comb great but i not care rest . it would cost effective buy items seperately this company	-1
this only gate market i could find would fit 12 foot doorway my livingroom dining area . it stated easy install but when screws kept breaking off inside my new woodwork i kept redrill holes i bit angry !!!! i suggest predrilling your holes !!! hinges also won't stay swinging gate doesn't line up . you need 2 hands close gate which busy mom 5 children you don't always 2 hands free ! end installing this gate it throw out	-1
this one those products good theory but not practice . i thought , " ooh what nifty idea , head bumper ! " whole idea great ; but if your baby wiggle worm like mine , then head bumper guard waste . i actually found this item more hazard than anything . because my son wiggles while he sleeps he ended up his arm stuck under side guards wrapped semicircle around bumpers . don't ask me how he this . good thing if he wet through his diaper pad underneath absorbed urine . other than it hassle keep crib	-1
i thought tiny love products good , so i bought this . first one i received water leaking out . second one doesn't make bubbles after few days music already sounds like battery dying . my baby seems like it , but it not live up what it advertises	-1
if your baby fingers or teeth this not trap . they easily take lid off scatter snacks glee .	-1
i bought two my kids ' seats . they constantly bunch up slip around . now i lose money shipping send them back refund . don't bother these . just fold up towel . it cheaper just convenient these things	-1
i don't care what other reviewers say , but this bed rail sucked !! i used it my sons toddler bed since it seemed only product would accomodate type bed . it took up so much mattress space my son barely room sleep his bed . it would constantly come unlocked . if i buy bed rail our next child it won't mesh one cause they get too dirty . i can't remember if this cover removable or not , if it i'm sure it would pain ** remove	-1
just note thank all parents who take time post their opinions ... i find " customer reviews " tremendous help when trying make decisions " grandma " needs ! i also advised my pregnant daughter check them out before making final decision anything ! thanks all you again !	-1

i researched many car seats settled this one . safe cute ! but it * major * flaw : strap comes up legs too close back seat . my daughter , only five months old , already almost sitting * * belt where it comes out . this mean buckle way too low tight , forcing belts cut into her chunky thighs pushing uncomfortably her pubic bone . i asked around online some forums , found many other mothers who returned this seat same reasons . many mothers didn't find it problem until their child least 20 lbs , but it problem me already , because we use cloth diapers , so my baby butt bigger due ' padding . ' this car seat wouldn't work well if your child chunky or uses cloth diapers ... even otherwise , i can't see how it would work child over 25 lbs or so ... britax roundabout croth belt different location , few inches further out back seat , so it one i am getting replacement	-1
i love this product fleece , but this so light-weight . it defeats purpose	-1
i loved this mattress pad when i first opened it , it made soft , natural cotton offers nice cushion baby . however , after washing it , i found it too small crib mattress , which standard size . i think they just skimped material , or didn't pre-wash . it good 2 inches too short ! it doesn't much stretch it , so i'm afraid i won't able use it all ! very disappointing	-1
tubbly bath dispenser fit our spout just fine , but minutes later it would work itself off . we tried everything get it work no luck . fortunately , company sells it agreed let us return it weeks later without receipt or packaging . don't even try it ... it not worth it ! look something else . there other faucet covers out there	-1

i think i've tried every bag i found disappointed all them . these just worst !! my daughter born prematurely never really got hang breastfeeding . i wanted her recieve all benefits breastmilk so i pumped . i pumped everday since day she born btwn 5 8 times day . i went through alot bags ( i use bottles now ) these pain . they small , thin , punctured easily , those twist ties ( although pumping directly into bag great concept ) just pain butt . i love medela pumps ( i own pump style advanced , seperate manual pump , used lactina hospital pump 3 months ) , i like their storage bottles , i even like their nipple cream , but these bags need some more work put into them	-1
idea behind these bags great - you pump straight into bag store them . execution , however , lousy . using twisties seal bags cumbersome annoying . i prefer lansinoh bags double seal . even though you can't pump straight into them , sealing them quick easy	-1
i started using these cloth diapering my first child . they hold plenty held up pretty well . ones i havn't bleeched still going strong after 6 years ! these aren't great chinese prefolds but then again they little bit cheaper , trimmer you get them when you need them rather than wait week them arrive mail . these best diapers sold stores	-1

warmer made such loud beep when it completed its task it woke our baby up . so much so we ended up staying near it shut it off before it went beeping ! also physically pull out power cord after each use it no auto shut off . [ ...	-1
i purchased this swing because we out town it much needed . we full sized papasan swing travel ocean wonders swings home ( which retrospect , we wishing we brought us ) . while neither those 100% perfect , they much better than this one . open frame allows child kick swing frame , stop swing moving , potentially get their feet/legs stuck bars . also , swing seat almost lays horizontal ( foot part swing much higher than head position)while swinging , point i am afraid if my daughter would wiggle bit , she would end up tipping seat backwards land floor . lastly , mobile horrible . it pitiful i find it hard believe fisher price put something like market . it plastic leaf little notches two toys strings . strings not end them you slide it into notches . these toys remain notches approximately 3 seconds . it very poor design needs lot work . my daughter ends up crumbled up ball one side swing more times than not - it doesn't seem support our other 2 swings . said , swing very attractive appealing . i only wish it better made more thought out .	-1
this not fold down 90 deg . don't buy if you think you'll able fold down change sheets or something	-1
i bought this thermometer when my second son born , thinking it would easy use good money . my husband i tested it ourselves see how accurate it . we both got 5 different readings . i didn't see what need plastic covers , since we ran out them quickly . ( not mention , you can't find replacements anywhere . ) my biggest complant after month , product completely stopped working , even after changing batteries . i would suggest paying extra money get better thermometer	-1
i bought this thermometer my daughter when she first born . it awful ! it gives strange readings like 94.5 95.1 , when fact i know she fever ! i bought just regular digital rectal thermometer pharmacy it gives more accurate readings . don't buy this , its waste time $$$$$$	-1
i excited when i purchased this ear thermometer because i ear thermometer years ago i loved . i unfortunately very disappointed this one performance . temperature seemed innaccurate when we testing it right after purchase . then two weeks ago my daughter came down fever . i could feel she burning up , but ear thermometer read 97.5 when i checked it ( twice ) . i got out oral thermometer discovered her fever actually 102.1 !!! needless say this thermometer went back store . i won't buy ear thermometer until i afford get better brand , like one i years ago ( thermoscan ) . :o	-1
i bought this older model graco pack ' play we got friends who no longer needed it . mattress measures 27 " 39 " before washing it my husband i tried it out see if it fit . it too small . i know it supposed snug but mattress won't even lay flat this sheet it . it seems like it'd great product , if only it slightly bigger fit properly .	-1
biggest disappointment after 6 months , tub began leaking air through unseen hole- maybe seams ( thus patch would not work ) . kel-gar not warranty product , store tub came ( via amazon ) only offered 90 day warranty . also , tub too wide fit standard tub- only half water tub spout lands tub , rest flows behind it . thus wasted water it takes longer fill	-1

my husband i purchased this warmer gift cards we received our second baby birth . we don't really like it . our wipes dry out down third , sometimes fourth wipe . that makes 6-8 wipe diaper change ! ( that lot wasted money ) other reviewers right wipes staying moist when it not full . but newborn , infant or even toddler i prefer convenience opening refill pack placing all wipes into warmer instead half wipes then finding something keep second half moist until it time refill other half . we wrap-around warmer our first child . it wore out around time we started potty training her . that style wipe warmer i would recommend new parents , not this one	-1
buy anything . buy regular old trash throw your diapers there because you'll get pretty much same end result . i don't pink diaper champ because i little boy but it still diaper champ it horrible . i diaper genie my older son ( now 4 ) gave it my brother . i wanted try something else drawn champ because you use kitchen trash bag .... woo hoo ... no refills !!! so three months now ( that how old my little butterball now ) i've used diaper champ first day it not so bad ( maybe because diapers floating enormous amount lysol i spray there fact i use forceflex trash bags ( prayer they won't break when i'm disposing diapers flood house old baby poop ) which also odor shield ( so bags start out smelling so nice ! ) but already day two , my husband walking nursery saying " hoooooooney , it smellllllls ! i clean thing all time .... stench remains . this week i ordered my diaper genie online . i feel like throwing party when it gets here . i'll spend extra few dollars some refills if it keeps guests enter my home wondering what earth died my house .	-1

good things : ( 1 ) baby loves watching hanging toys . ( 2 ) nature sounds very well very pleasant . bad things : ( 1 ) very troublesome assemble . supplied screws cheap metal they screwed into plastic threads . most critical support structure ( kickstand ) i could not get all screws into their holes completely before screws stripped out . but i get it together well enough use . however , i considered returning it store during assembly . ( 2 ) vibration feature broke after 1 month use . ( 3 ) baby cannot reach toys , even 3 months age , we very tall baby . ( 4 ) toys very easily removed their " holes " so you can't really move chair without toys falling out . ( 5 ) rocker very big " footprint " . it takes up half surface area our four-seat kitchen table	-1
we bought this car seat ( snap ' go ) based good reviews ( not ones listed here ) . it not meet our expectations . i give it 2 stars just safety it . otherwise , i hard time finding positive things say . it way too heavy . our baby 7 lbs+ his early days , it heavy carry around . now he almost 20 pounds 5+ months , it nearly impossible carry him any length time . adjustable strap often gets stuck we really tug make it work . most grocery carts it too big it face towards you you shop . when you clip it cart , front end suspended air . i just put it sideways which pain . also , handle bar built easier carry ... i don't agree . it still awkward- i end up hooking it under my arm . lastly , put handle bar up down very difficult . you squeeze taps both sides really push hard get it release . i'm sorry i don't any others recommend . i hoped like this am just suffering until he doesn't need support grocery car t---t hat really only reason i still use it	-1
we got this lieu similar one because it stock , but lo behold it only lasted week . our son lays his back kicks everything his crib , so when he kicked this , knob securing it crib through strap broke off . luckily broken piece fell floor not into his crib , where it could posed choking hazard ! pass this get fisher price one - ocean wonders or one we got , flutterbye dreams , which he loves	-1
i recently purchased two these sheets ended up taking them right back . they say they're fitted but they aren't elastic so they're not well fitted . they paper thin . apparently graco hasn't put these their pack plays observed quality ! i purchased koala portable sheets which cheaper , thicker , truly fitted elastic ! don't waste your money these	-1

i used this tub my first born . this small holds very little water , therefore , water gets cold fast ! also , there holes where tub folds up so water spills out holes baby moves . it messy if you giving your baby bath floor i . our baby would stick her foot leg out tub because it so small ... when i used larger tub , didn't happen . one positive thing i say this product it compact ... i kept it my mother house it didn't take up much space . i would recommend spending extra $10 $15 buy higher quality tub .	-1
this tub great beginning - it fit perfectly our kitchen sink we able bathe our baby no problems all . it great she could sit warm water not get cold while i washing her , etc . however , after using tub 10 times , it suddenly collapsed into bottom sink my baby inside . basically , top bottom ends fold up storage just buckled . she wasn't hurt , but very scared . keep mind this problem started when my baby 12 lbs - so i don't think her weight issue	-1
not believe manufactures claims you don't need jacket if you this bunting . we 7am enfant bunting our daughter her first winter loved it . it hood ( could unzipped ) completely covered her up kept her toasty warm without any extra clothing . now she outgrown it i bought one these replacemen t.t here no way any stretch anyones imagination you use this bunting without needing coat hat well . zip only zips half way up chest my one year old . yes you could pull up flap cover her chest but she just pushes it down again since there no way keep it up ! it keep her just warm enough coat , hat mittens temp 35f , but i want something you use without coat . after much research i am returning this ( after single outing ) getting little kazook instead ( which zips all way up hood )	-1

we diaper dekor plus it seems i'm only reviewer here so far terrible problem it bad smell . first couple months weren't bad , but after 3 months or so , it really started smell bad . this horrid smell only got worse use time went . we tried everything we could think get rid smell-letting it " air out " outside , cleaning it bleach or some other cleaning solution , putting baking soda bottom liner even leaving small box baking soda inside but outside liner , letting it soak bathtub soap water ... we even bought some scented disc type things ( purchased babies us ) you put bottom it only made smell worse . we continued use it , but frequently let it air out or spray it lysol or something . eventually we used it less less , we just threw it away when we moved new home few weeks ago-we'd it almost 2 years . we knew there no way anyone else would want use it smell knowing they couldn't get rid it . it real shame because aside smell , it great product	-1
our pursuit ultimate baby items , infant carseat topped our list . what more important than safety your first child , especially so unpredicatable situation driving ? our search led us this graco carseat , we added it our wish list recieved it christmas gift , just before our daughter birth january . seat fairly attractive , but its good points stop there . it bear install . not because it complicated , but rather because you need extraordinarily strong man ( or woman , unlike myself certainly ) install base . we ended up taking it inspector who spent 5 minutes tugging belts all his might , then huffed puffed told us " should there real good , now . " we examined it , asked why seat still able flip up toward back car , he replied , " oh they all , that normal . " unsure , but safety rating back it , we continued use it . throughout her first 7 months it cumbersome piece equipment . lots bumping banging it get it into car baby already seat ( we 3 4-door sedans , 1992 subaru legacy , 80-something oldsmobile , my mom 2006 saturn ion . seat already car , it struggle get baby without bumping her head or catching her legs sides least once - me . my husband simply can't put her carseat already car . not mention , seat - while installed car - never felt especially stable , exception my mom ion , which latch system . course , drawback ion my 6'1 " husband barely fit into front seat because carseat so large cumbersome he cannot move his seat back so he sort smashed into dashboard . then , past week seat begun fall over while we're driving . literally , go around curve , look back , her seat 45 degree angle backseat car . my daughter 8.5 months old still falls bit below weight height limits seat . we've checked belts secure seat , pulled all our might , seat continues malfuction . this safety issue if i've ever seen one . enough force , she could end up directly her side , say force side impact accident . upon closer inspection , i shouldn't altogether shocked . base seat proportionately much smaller than top where baby sits . sort like wine glass , i suppose - so it top heavy , likely heavier load top , greater likelihood it topple slightest provocation . needless say , we'll begin shopping new seat immediately . snugride , i would recommend parents think twice before purchasing it . i'd certainly never consider it older vehicle without latch system , i'd still take it trial run newer one latch system . hindsight i wish i shopped around bit more .	-1
these complete waste money . nipples flow too fast newborn . i tried using them many times during my return work transition my daughter choked cried during each feeding . she also swallowed so much air-i burping her what seemed hours . bottles too expensive just storage-you purchase generic breastmilk storage bottles made evenflow $3.99 ... personally i like use storage bags laid flat my freezer , they take up less space	-1
i bought this my daughter while i still pregnant , thinking it would helpful thru first few months ( well later ) terms able keep up my daily chores my 2 1/2 y.o. son . it certainly wasn't cheap , so i assumed it would good product , appeared safe comfortable younger infants . don't let product description fool you ! just it says some other reviews , it very possible your child fall when this sling , because it crappy strap tightener . my daughter small newborn , only weighing 8lbs nearly 2 months , which first time i tried using sling . even small , 2 minutes i sling i could already tell strap starting loosen . ( definitely not safe ! ) aside , this item so big bulky i literally could not even see my daughter it . i might well just put duffel bag over my shoulder plopped her into it . there wouldn't much difference two . i would strongly advise you not purchase this product ! i want get rid mine , since it brand new , but i threw away box so i can't return it . i absolutely cannot , good concience , sell it anyone else their child . so , i no choice but just bite my tongue throw product trash . don't make same mistake i !	-1
i've owned my diaper dekor plus just under 2 years . first , i thought it worked fine . it easy deal , easy empty . first liner it came lasted me 6 months ( 1 baby - using newborn diapers through size 2 ) . however , unit failed control odors after 9 months . since then i've hide it various places my home keep odor minimum . definitely not convenien t.t he unit one particularly fundamental flaw regarding odor control . unlike diaper champ which allows you deposit diaper without opening container letting odors escape , diaper dekor no such provision . it two " trap doors " allow you drop diaper easily , then they supposed spring back into place . still , no matter how quickly you drop diaper , let top lid fall closed , strong odors inevitably escape . also , these " trap doors " quite flimsy . hinge one them recently broke so door no longer springs back into its closed position , thereby contributing odor problem . i inquired replacement regal lager they said i could purchase one $10 . instead i decided purchase new diaper champ , since i've pretty much it this thing . speaking flimsy , there two other flaws i've experienced . firstly , plastic foot pedal cracked seems loose . it still works , but i wonder how much longer . also , door bottom unit enables you cut off bag remove it not close very tightly , once again contributing lack odor control . door only held shut small plastic latch , leaving significant gap odors escape . overall , i not impressed diaper dekor plus . however , contrary what some people say regarding liner refills , actually never one my bigger complaints . i not find them cost-prohibitive all , because you get 3 liners $20 i found 3 liners last me 6 months holding toddler-size diapers . 1 year 9 months i've owned this system , i've only purchase refills twice . only thing i didn't like it i find it inconvenient purchase liners online ( couldn't find any local store carried them ) wait them shipped me , especially when there no indication when you reach end your last liner . diaper dekor only system i used extensively , i would not buy it again nor recommend it anyone . i'm hoping my diaper champ serve me better	-1

i purchased this sterilizer based recommendation friend . after just few uses , steamer stopped working . when lever turn steamer pushed , it just wouldn't turn any more . i contacted first years manufacturer , say least , they excellent customer service . they no problem replacing unit . upon receiving second unit , i used steamer once . because steamer couldn't hold every thing first run i run it twice row . my disappointment , i pressed lever again it not work . frustratingly , i pushed lever several times then light finally came . unless you cool it half hour or more , this how my unit operated . i'm sure not every one experience same but this how mine . i definitely would caution buyers product - only because this problem occured twice units i used .	-1

i safari tt dbl jogger step i bought this shade because shade stroller non-existent . i seen this product work well single strollers , but it keeps blowing up back my canopy slighest breezes , so it not doing such great job keeping sun off my kid faces . i've used binder clip keep it place , but it still blows back more than i think it should ..	-1

we bought this thinking our son would love neaty gadgets sounds ... we several major issues it . 1 ) pee guard . it doesn't really latch stay . our son irritated pee guard we he first learning kept ripping it off seat then throwing it accross room . luck would it , when i would go retrieve item , he would pee since there no guard , pee would go everywhere but seat/ pot . resolve this i use special adhesive plastics ( super glue didn't work all ) which took 24 hours set which interuppted our potty training . it also turned part seat yellow which made it look dirty even when it not . but i no choice- guard stay . 2 ) sensors too sensitive would go off even when he nothing . he could just sdjust his position seat it would tell him he great job going potty even though he never went . 3 ) sounds gadgets too distracting . he wanted play them would turn around seat this would sometimes when he pee it would end up all over me/ floor/ whatever nearby . i finally just took batteries out told him it broken . 4 ) when he ready use actual potty , we took it apart per direction placed it top one our toilet seats . everytime he pees i hold down his " bits " because seat not go all way down make seal potty seat toilet seat , thus it leaks out under potty seat onto toilet seat then down front toilet onto his pants/ underware/ etc . pee guard useless this feature . sometimes even when i hold his stuff down , if he wiggles or moves , then he not position ... there only one position he or it go all over seat down toilet onto his clothes . it most expensive toilet seat available store . we thought we would getting top quality seat begining end our son potty training experience . price what motivated me try make it work us . finally , i threw darned thing garbage just got circo toilet seat pee guard toilets . it least expensive toilet adapter it turned out best . if we child , i am going get basic toilet seat/ no frills inexpensive toilet adapter . both together fraction what we paid this seat would million times less aggrevating . don't waste your money	-1
i bought this stroller my daughter , thinking we could transition into it around 6 months . she hated it . stroller lacked back support she would slide down seat . she would cry within five minutes riding stroller . after several months use , wheel fell off . also , stroller hard stear . you need both arms stroller push . if you try guide it one hand then it goes direction . even now she 16 months old able support her own body , she prefers other strollers . i bought cheap stroller wal-mart ten times more satisfied . this stroller recommended my brother who twins uses aria tandam , which i assume better . i would not recommend it consumer	-1
when we first received this stroller , we loved it ! it handled well -- very smooth , easy turns , could directed one hand . my one complaint handle too short someone longer legs . but we started using it more more , we found it not very " user-friendly . " one , way it opened not intuitive . we push it out forward while pulling up levers each side handle bar . forget trying this while holding baby . also , canopy too small doesn't meet baby carrier canopy when used travel system . result , keep sun off baby , we needed extra blanket . these minor inconveniences , but real trouble started when my son outgrew baby carrier began riding stroller solo . we quickly realized how stupidly designed harness straps . they simply slid into clip back support , so my active son could easily move forward unclip straps . he still held harness , but he able move little too freely could easily lean over or forward grab wheels . too , after year half daily use , handling deteriorated . wheels stick when climbing hills when turning i constantly backtrack get them realigned .	-1

some assembly required . i consider myself fairly skilled assmebling things ... i engineering degree ... i've put together bikes , furniture , installed car stereos , this thing absolute pain , especially such simple device . i found instructions woefully inadequate . i found images useless , instructions leave out fairly critical steps - like how orient various pieces together . takes 10 times longer install then it would if they taken effort provide more guidance . it aggravating enough make me go straight amazon upon finishing leave feedback ... i didn't even buy it amazon . gate itself fine	-1

heed bad reviews . i think problem may medela definition " occasional use . " i used this pump once every other day or two month half -- apparently deemed more than occasional , because pump yields very little now ... half what it used . so this yet review leads same conclusion : i should gotten different pump	-1

i bought this chair because it got such good reviews looks great . i so sick seeing fish , butterflies primary colors all over our house - neutral tones sight sore eyes ! but i've so disappointed this chair function . all nooks crannies buckles straps , it impossible keep clean . straps parts vinyl seat became so caked food i threw them into washing machine - even though tags says not . worst part seat tray . it ridiculously wide -- too big my dishwasher my kitchen sink ! ( both full sized . ) way my toddler smears food tray , there no way i could just wipe it rag it . washing it turns into exercise hosing down my countertops sink sprayer . oh well , least they get clean too ... also , i agree other reviewers it really difficult slide tray into place . i wind up shaking it around my poor toddler looks me like i'm torturing him . bright side , recline feature wonderful infants babies who just getting hang sitting up . overall , if i it over again i'd pick simple fisher price ..	-1

i registered these bottles i am new mom thought variety great . we used stage one nipple my son able suck down his formula no problem infact way quick . he would struggle feeding time . he so gassy horrible reflux , during feeding he would arch his back stffin his body cry . i recommendation switch dr. brown bottles which made huge diffrence . however , he still spiting up still little gassy just not bad it managable , their stage 1 nipples small stage two big . we gone camping trip i bought playtex disposable bottles easier cleaning . i also some research these bottles found several people liked them better then dr. brown . so i tried them my son doing much better he dosen't even spit up anymore . so if you like ventair i think you would like disposable much better . my sons dr. wanted put him antacid but i not comfortable giving him medication such young age i wanted see if i could solve problem , which i completly playtex disposable bottles !	-1

i really thought these cutest bumper pads , but after hearing over over again how you shouldn't use bumper pads because risk suffication , i decided it wouldn't worth risk put them crib . i don't think there enough ties them hold them securely one , even if there i wouldn't comfortable thought my daughter getting her head caught up under them . she able scoot across her crib since she newborn so there never ideal time use these . again , cute nursery set up pre-baby , but i wouldn't use afterwards	-1

we bought this product based its testimonials thought it would best choice our new baby . while he no problems using playtex nursers , he ended up problem dr. brown natural flow bottles . first off , they pain clean . each piece needs painstakenly washed ( boiling nipple , washing bottle , scrubbing each hole insert reservoir . ) it certainly laborsome time consuming . anyhow , when he uses them , he spits up where he didn't competition . i tried figure out why . if you tip bottle over it drips constantly without any sucking . so my baby not sucking or swallowing when he uses this product . he lets it build up his mouth then ends up push it out when he gotten too much . needless say , we planning return these stick playtex	-1
definately not potty boys . other reviewers , shield not stay . looking simple basic potty now :o	-1

when my daughter tiny , she enjoyed this sling ... one or two occasions i managed endure discomfort wearing it more than two minutes . cotton fabric doesn't offer much support baby weight i found it became uncomfortable very quickly . it also didn't feel secure some padded , over-the-shoulder style slings . i actually afraid not keep arm my baby all times , which defeats purpose .	-1

i very excited get these bowls mail because they so cute , concept suction bowl ( ) appealing me . my son loved bowl right away , he able reach into bowl some puffs feed himself instead push puffs around table until he could finally grab one his fingers . i'd also like add he ate tofu cubes first time out this bowl loved them ! however , i'm disappointed because suction bowl not work more than few seconds . i'm constantly pushing bowl back down , which disruptive his meal . despite some happy memories i've this bowl , i would not recommend buying these bowls because ' suction bowls ' they not serve their purpose	-1
what if you just bought this product : go outside bang your head hard you against side your house --- maybe knock some sense into you after you've gone looney trying use this piece junk !!! many reviewers noted , it extremely difficult get this bottle warmer work properly . first off , little vials you use measure water into poorly marked -- why they choose use teeny-tiny white lettering ? stupid ! it then very tricky get proper amount water into vials . fact difference say , level 2 level 3 maybe two drops water ! trying doing out standard faucet . fact we use filtered water faucet ( thin spout ) it still hard get write . but that easy compared figuring out right water-in-the-vial formula-in-the bottle ratio ! we currently using 4oz playtex bottle ( disposable bags ) contantly playing guessing game right amount water use . level 3 --- still cold , but wait , last night same amount water practically scalded formula ! just try use vented-type bottle ... forget it ! how 8oz . bottle ? no way ! either way cold or way hot . even though we use filtered water , this thing still need cleaned vinegar ( recommended ) evey week or so . however , cleaning barely hepls after less than 8 weeks use we now use microwave more more . why ? because we know 4oz . formula always need 6-7 seconds microwave ... every time	-1
i bought this car seat based good ratings it received . however , it not work my son until he 5 months old . my son born 5 lb . 11 oz . he not fit snugly into this seat , even head cushion . his head rolled around or rolled forward . i tried put washcloths or towels around but it not work . also , if i adjust base so car seat flatter , it would roll around lot more ( i leather seats ) . additionally , material seat not breathable -- it velvety -- so my son back head would become very sweaty longer trips , even winter . i would say once my son bigger ( 14 pounds 26 inches ) , i removed head cushion moved seat belt higher position -- this when he actually " fit " into seat , however fabric still issue his back head still become very sweaty , making him very uncomfortable longer trips .	-1
i bought this doll because expensive price , i figured it would best . it definitely not . patty cute , but only good thing her . fill up her bottles , you must squeeze insert into glass water , then squeeze again until water shoots out then reinsert into glass water again . it requires it such particular way only adult fill bottles water , no small child able master precise way it takes . then , feed patty you must hold her very still exact angle , where she almost standing up . most children cradle their baby dolls their arms , but patty not drink position . even standing up position , most water spills out tiny hole her mouth soaks her outfit . it takes 5-10 minutes fill patty up . most children don't patience this lose interest , my daughter . plus since she perfectly still exact angle , only adult feed patty her water . then , make her pee , you must press her thigh very hard . this distressed my daughter because she thought i hurting patty . once i assured her patty ok , then she upset because she not strong enough press hard enough make patty pee . my daughter 35 months old lot children start training earlier . 35 months old , my daughter not able fill bottles , feed patty or make her pee . only adult these things due complexity bottles feeding peeing systems patty . so my daughter quickly lost interest patty started squirting water all over bathroom instead bottles . whole " teach doll pee " part potty training lost . i wish i gone store bought cheap wetting doll instead . then i e-mailed company complain , but course received no response . you can't get full refund if doll used . fact , getting refund all extremely difficult , i just given up . don't waste your money . this doll too expensive cannot used child , which defeats whole purpose . go your toy store buy cheap wetting doll . least way , if you don't like it you return it , unlike patty	-1
these come both boy girl colors . picture shows pink , purple , yellow bottles . i received blue green bottles . i contacted amazon who promptly sent me three sets ( all first three sets wrong ) . second shipment they only got one set right . i e-mailed return these well . when i sent back five incorrect sets company would not refund my money because " they already replaced items " . careful when ordering this site	-1
i bought this after renting hospital-grade medela lactima . big difference . backpack compact , sleek , inconspicuous but pump sucks . it one adjustment speed/suction computer chip selects best combination two you . well , after few pumps my nipples fall off . if i lower suction comfortable , reasonable level , pump way too fast . if i slow pump mimic my baby speed , suction excruciatingly painful -- it still doesn't pump slow enough . i am very unhappy this wish we'd just rented hospital-grade year instead . little cooler cute , but it tough actually fit frozen insert ( " blue " plastic thing ) four bottles there . it convenient horns pump directly into standard-size bottles ( it pump into dr. browns evenflo bottles too , any regular mouth size bottles ) or bags . i love setup , just wish pump slower speed settings speed suction truly adjustable independent each other . i can't pain like this all time am looking other options . :(	-1
initially , i thought these angled bottles make lot sense so i put different sizes into our registry . however , when our baby girl ( 1 week old ) first tried suck milk out bottle , it not come out . my husband activated vent everything according instructions . he thought holes not big enough since he not see any nipple , so he put more holes them but still nothing came out . he finally found out way these bottles work not same traditionally bottle . hole not open unless pressure applied against it hole get sealed back again when released . baby use their tongue push against nipples order open up hole . newborn infant , it too difficult them figure out how get milk out especially if you bottle feeding only . luckily we two avent bottles ( traditionally hole idea ) so she doing very well avent bottles she still loves them lot . we ended up returning unused ventair bottles got lots avent bottles but still stuck opened ones . i not recommend these ' difficult ' bottles newborn . baby should not need ' think ' how get milk out . leaking problem , we not any issue avent bottles . when it leaks , it usually because nipples not properly placed ( push all way though ring ) or ring not tightly screwed . we also found out if you use warmer warm bottle , you unscrew ring once screw it all tight again after warmer . it because theory heat expense plastic bottle which creates gap ring , nipples bottle neck . this works 99% us no leak . we fans avent bottles .	-1
i bought these my daughter thinking maybe they wouldn't leak like last ones i used . they don't leak , but stage 1 too slow frustrates her . she 5 months stage 2 too fast . they made huge mistake not making more stages . i realized this before i used them , i would taken them all back	-1

who ever designed this gate no clue what expect 1 year old child . this gate all look no function . it looks great when you install it but no strenght resist 13 month old child pushing it middle almost breaking it . if you plan buying this gate prepared little bit drilling bolting make it work . i finally able use thing only after i bought four #8 -32 1 3/4 " long screws matching washers nuts bolted middle gate together . i this unscrewing original connection middle gate overlapped pieces together 6 " then drilling two holes 4 " apart top bottom rails bolting together . it works ! but it not what someone should after spending thie price something . good luck !!	-1
i can't believe anyone would give this stroller good review . we 10m twins , using stroller 4-5 months . it terrible . problems : 1 . no sun protection . visors locked place . unless sun directly overhead or your back , it beating your babies ' eyes , you'll need buy non-peg perego sunshade accessory . 2 . hard steer . it gets stuck going across lawn compacted dirt . if sidewalk buckles just inch ( common tree roots ) , stroller stopped dead its tracks . it hard steer straight line , so it easy get stuck when going through narrow doorways or down narrow sidewalks . 3 . it flimsy . bottom storage area underneath stretched sagged after month use . it now drags ground rubs against wheels even when nothing it . cupholder broke during first week . 4 . hard unfold . it takes two hands unfold you give it vigorous shake get it completely unfold snap into position . don't even think trying set it up baby your hands : you need both hands free deal this thing . 5 . bad customer support . stroller comes no weight/height/age suggestions . when we first tried put our twins it , they swimming it , couldn't upright . when we called peg perego asked how big kids should use it safely , support rep said " don't know . " yes it lightweight folds up nicely . but light weight actually drawback ; it means handle legs flimsy wobbly -- resulting stroller that difficult steer . my advice would seriously consider jogging strollers . even if you aren't active parent -- i'm not -- get something sturdy big wheels get you over dips bumps cracks patches sand , dirt , grass you encounter . if stroller size most important factor you , look " stadium seating " strollers .	-1
i bought this stroller when we our second child . my children 19 mo . apart . i aria single stroller my first loved it . this one definitely not same . one thing , it very hard steer get over bumps . wheels always getting stuck . second , it hard close . most frustrating part steering issue . also , my aria decal fell off well many months ago . i've only stroller nine months . one more thing , canopy block out sun basically worthless since it offers very little protection sun .	-1
this diaper pail affordable uses regular garbage bags , both which important us when buying diaper pail before reality dirty diapers . even when we emptied pail often sprayed it lysol uses , it still smelled bad every time we opened it . sometimes smell seeped out , so it made whole bedroom stink . my kids no problem pressing blue lid-popping latch-and , course , adding their toys or other opjects contents dirty diaper pail . twisting mechanism remove full bag great idea . it helps you not get face full odor when you open pail ... but you cannot let pail get even close full , or it wont twist . after two years use , twisting mechanism doesn't work anymore . latch small opening also broken	-1
my husband i bought this hopes it would keep odor inside we could save money refills . well , it not control odor . plastic disk included neutralize odor works week . odor escaped even when pail closed . you save money refills first . but when diapers become stinkier baby grows , you change bag more often . i used lot baking soda lysol spray help control stink . also , button top opens pail fail easily , it also very easy child get into once they start pulling up things . i would not recommend this product	-1
it flimsy ... breaks slightest touch ... it pain open close ! my 15 month old figured out all you shake gate little it opens ... i found this out when i putting groceries away ... i went look her she 2nd stair top ! i can't say enough bad things this gate . it worthless . if i could rate it minus stars i would	-1

other reviewer stated , seal appears faulty this , it stopped working almost straight away . i seen many other bad reviews this product well	-1
this great idea , however if your crib anything larger than jenny lind style piece wood it , it won't work . we don't sleigh style crib , but top edges still too large velcro even touch . it would great if they would come up larger size work more popular/larger style cribs everyone seems making/buying these days	-1
these extensions should included co-sleeper . it , co-sleeper lower than average adult bed extensions required if you want your child sleeping your level . fact they sell it separate item pure gouging extra few bucks , which irritating . they simple pieces plastic shouldn't add but dollar or two arms reach cos t.t here twelve pieces , so you use max 3 pieces per leg increase it maximum height . we just , found three connected pieces * very * unstable . it too bad they charge so much poorly constructed set unstable plastic pieces . what they should provide set pieces varying heights , prevent too many connections bed that holding your precious child	-1
this product terrible . first foremost this seat not fit american airlines business class seats ! secondly , rear facing car seat tilts so far forward your baby falling forward agains harness if they fall asleep their face pressing against seat belt . wheel covers fell off first time i used it . stroller piece junk . when i called company explain my problems they never even called me back , so top it all they horrible product terribel customer service match . not buy	-1
i liked this tub first . size nice , sling comfortable good support my preemie newborn . after month use , though , there horrible odor emitting mesh sling . this after " squeezing " it out best i could propping it up dry after every use . sling not machine washable therefore unusable after it gets ruined mold . i stopped using sprayer after first couple days . it just too much pain fill it up everytime , especially since it doesn't even spray well . other reviewers correct saying button sprayer difficult press . especially when your hands wet slippery . it good thing bru take back anything ! i am off return it purchase old faithful cheapie tub	-1
i've never written negative review ... if i could give this zero stars i would . first all , it sinks instant you put it tub ... like all way bottom tub . tag says ring it out if it sinks ... hmmm ... how you when your kid it ? second all , it weighs 100 lbs when you take it out tub . i swear ... this worst baby product i've ever owned ( i've owned lot ) ... my 6mo son sits up great his own , slipping sliding around this , falling backwards , i hold him entire time both hands ... pathetic . don't waste your money . tomorrow we going out get traditional plastic bath seat ... good grief	-1
we researching booster seats our 2 year old we found this seat thought it large enough sturdy enough our rambunctious son . boy , we wrong . first time we put our son it seat fell apart . so we popped it back into place all he wiggle bit seat pops out again . he only weighs 30 pounds it specs up 50 .... i would definitely not recommend this anyone .	-1
we bought this booster when my son 18 months old he loved sit like his parents . however , he very large boy ( 35 " 34 lbs ) tray could not fit over his legs comfortably . so we took off tray so he could sit table , he uses holes where tray attaches stick food . we went back high chair without tray - he perfectly happy . we use this seat when visiting relatives which nice it so portable , but then spend time afterwards cleaning up food underneath seat where he stuck food	-1
i am so perplexed popularity this item ! when it first came out , i purchased one my son ( he around six months old time ) . he immediately figured out how get out seat leaning back , extending his arms behind him , straightening his legs , so i returned it . time i my second child ( girl ) , bumbomania kicked , these seats everywhere . i began think my son experience fluke , i purchased one my daughter . low behold , she immediately figured out how get out seat exact same way ! so i returned second bumbo well , but not before noticing instructions contain warning some children " may " able get out seat . conclusion , although bumbo may work great some - beware ! if you little houdinis like i , this product simply not safe	-1
i state this monitor very clear no interference but ours died after five months just nighttime use neither charger works ... we tried plugging monitors directly into wall , charging days time , even searched endlessly replacement batteries no luck . i ignored review i read similar one i'm writing just before i purchased this imonitor , i learned my lesson ! purchase caution .	-1

this nothing but cheap piece masonite board you cut $5.00 any hardware store . it cost me total $23.00 after shipping this product . it doesn't even look like picture . it isn't black angelcare written it . it literally normal , brown piece board . it blatant false advertizing . i feel sick , not mention total idiot thinking i would actually need this particular board go my monitor . if you angelcare movement sensor monitor don't flat bottomed crib then all you need any old piece wood or thick cardboard . not buy this . it disgrace	-1
first loved it because travel system , stroller , so light doesn't look doudy like other systems . but : harness buckle so difficult fasten baby gets irritated before we even get car . straps never tangled , but it extremely difficult adjust needed . carrying handle moved up/down two hands , button each , must simultaneously pushed lower handle . difficult perform when you're already reaching into center car even get baby . yes it trendy color gray , but it not cotton not padded well not breathe ! it horribly hot baby . still love stroller combi , but i never recommend car seat anyone . luckily , time move 5 month old larger seat anyway .	-1

perhaps if i hadn't already different type bunting , i wouldn't so disappointed this one . my sister loaned me her eddie bauer bunting when my son born . she her next baby any week now , so i return it her which meant i buy new one . i saw nothing but great reviews this product , so i picked one up . first all , i followed washing instructions , washing it separately delicate drying it low , it ripped one seam !! based alone , i returning it . aside , used bunting different design , i am not thrilled this one . part point using bunting so when you're car where you heat , you open up bunting longer drive so baby doesn't overheat . this bunting zips down both sides bottom ( way , zipping/unzipping tricky baby kicking around ; zipper gets stuck material lot ) , rather than down middle front ( style zipper never problem ) . then you this thick cover baby feet nowhere go it , bottom carseat up against back seat car ! so you either rig it so it up back seat tucked under headrest , or you leave it baby legs . also , top this bunting fold over so baby face isn't covered unless you want it , but ... my 5-month old no problem picking it up pulling it up over his own face . he it this morning way daycare . this bunting too thick me feel comfortable him doing . i can't reaching back seat pull it down off his face ! there no disputing concept bunting great , this particular bunting toasty warm . it wonderful able put baby his carseat strap him safely w/out snowsuit way , or bundle him up before going out unbundle him every time you get your destination . but i don't think design urban bundle-me great i actually think this bunting too warm ( even bunting open long car ride other day , my son back all sweaty when we took him out carseat ) . after calling several stores looking all my options babies ' ' us , i ended up ordering new eddie bauer all-season bunting target.com ( which cost less than $20 including shipping ) . i can't wait till it gets here . i returning $60 urban bundle-me soon i	-1

first , adhesive/velcro fasteners which attach this cover stroller inadequate say least . second , it opaque , so kids couldn't even take their surroundings . since it resembles parachute , only reason kids even got fresh air because * stupid * thing wouldn't stay attached stroller , kids probably wouldn't fresh air . go hats sunscreen/protective garments instead	-1
this nicely designed walker my baby likes it most part but we not exactly satisfied it one reason . front wheels turn all directions but rear wheels don't . just like car , it only go forward backward , but not sideways . sometimes my baby turns her upper body side tries reach something her left or right but she can't push walker way because design , she gets frustrated . if both front wheels rear wheels types turn any direction , it would much greater mobility	-1

this pump really slow , absolutely kills your hand . same price get avent isis manual pump , it waaaaaay faster because massaging petals you get way more milk per pump , so it doesn't hurt your hand . i haven't found it hurts my hand all , because you use it way less time pump far less often .	-1
i used one these my son ( he 3 , so it wasn't long ago ) but i getting ready use it again my daughter , i started thinking what pain floppy seat use . getting it back into it " bag " such hassle i used just plunk thing back into backseat car after shopping ... which made convienent small-space self storage waste time money . this thing named well , it really floppy- floppy put into cart floppy try put away again . i started reading reviews other seat covers , trying find better option i sure found it ! i really hesitant price buggy bagg , but i could tell when i took it out box it worth extra money ! i've only buggy bagg 3 days i am already thrilled i spent money it ... definitely worth extra $20 ! it super-well padded really , truly put into cart one hand !

i absolutely agree this review : " you not get your moneys worth ..., february 26 , 2006 " we bought this stroller per recommendation friend ours . we sable color , which i see not sold this year ... but i digress . we using this stroller eight months our eight month old absolutely fed up it . my biggest complaint steering . front wheels slide sideways over any smooth surface if we're not smooth surface , it feels like i am pushing stroller into brick wall because they don't rotate allow me push stroller forwards . i am always backing up turning order get front wheels align so i get where i want go . shopping joke this stroller because i cannot get it navigate aisles easily . shoulder straps attached back stroller little plastic tab which , really , doesn't seem like best way keep child shoulders restrained . it ends up coming out tab holder my son virtually only wearing lap belt . this fine now he able handle 3 point instead 5 point harness but when he younger , this got my nerves . adult cup holder joke , so we took it off my son figured out how take kid cupholder out so it doesn't stay any longer well . oh , thing folding down so handlebar catches sunshade complaint spot . so frustrating ! not big deal , really , but poor design because sunshade prevents handlebar locking folded up stroller folded up position most time . i just remembered also , sides padding seat area , when i used this stroller our graco snugride car seat , would bunch up prevent car seat sitting securely . i would prop edges padding seat area underneath arm-rests seat area ( parts say aria ) before i put car seat into stroller seat area so it would sit deep enough latch onto cup area allow security strap go over carseat snugly . if peg perego could fix steering , i think i would able live rest my complaints but steering factor enough me trash whole 9 pound thing now i found stroller steers so much easier my 22 pound 8 month old son	-1
i used these through out my daughter infancy , largely because i bought whole set them , milk storage contraptions , breast pump , pacifiers . plus once she used pacifiers nipples she wouldn't take any other kind . but bottles routinely leaked , ruining several diaper bags , clothing , nighttime feedings . apparently you screw cap just right- which really difficult 3 am ! my daughter didn't seem gas colic other reviews talk , but we use quite bit gas medicine 3 6 months . all all , i think paci great , rest it i could without .	-1

our 4 month old loved this toy , first . but we replace batteries so frequently end it didn't work more than it . runs through batteries much too quickly . also , unable start it remote control so we reach over carseat push button begin . but now it trash because i touched straps holding it up they disintegrated into blue dust . not very safe . very disappointed	-1
i saw this store , i just buy it . i loved all little pockets storing different things ; it would keep all my baby changing gear other necessities all one place . picture cover shows it stocked full hanging side dresser , which used changing table . what marvelous concept ! so , i took it out package , attached it dresser put all my gear onto it . it looked very smart hanging there , so practical ! when i came room next day , it floor crumpled lump . so , little disheartened , but not wanting give up , i hooked it up my crib , instead . it next best thing i really like device . i put all my gear there once more , wipes top shelf just like picture , but top shelf so flimsy wipes topple off it . so , not only i not hook it up my changing table , i also can't keep all changing gear it . this essentially makes this ill-made product completely worthless purpose it designed .	-1
we purchased this stroller its convenience car frequent travel . i think it safe say we ambivalent relationship volo , not including my 12 month old daughter who would give it definite thumbs down . up side it very light folds easily compact . not mention everyone gets see you maclaren stroller wonderful shade orange . stroller great airport quick shopping trips when you out car . we first purchased volo without springing seat pad . this mistake our daughter clearly uncomfortable unwilling spend significant time stroller . seat pad increase her comfort level but she still grows tired volo much more quickly than her larger stroller . i think this fact she not very upright volo cannot shift much seat it offers no support . top it , velcro seat pad becomes unhinged each time you fold stroller - minor annoyance but hassle all same . awning offers very little sun protection . mesh cargo area holds very little difficult access . top , you need empty it completely order fold stroller . when it comes travel volo leaves much desired . limited cargo room , it becomes quite unstable if you hang anything handles . it no recline making it difficult children sleep well - problem when you want spend day wandering . further , while it great such lightweight stroller when getting it out car , riding escalators getting off bus , volo flounders once you get off well-paved surfaces . we encountered potholes , dirt paths , cobblestones sand our tavels volo disaster . wheels would spin erratically catch large divets gutters . locking front wheels so they would not swivel provided little relief . cobblestones particularly disastrous stroller so hard manage such uncomfortable ride we ended up carrying both child volo . if i it over , i would opt compact stroller weighs bit more but offers larger wheels , easy-access storage supported reclining seat	-1

graco might making killing this product they charge over $100 something appears made less than $20 worth materials . seat much too big fit regular compact car such 2006 nissan sentra unless you decide install center seat location which advantage safer , but much more inconvenient . documentation , my opinion very poor , i've installed linux systems scratch w/ less documentation ... bad documentation could lead unnecessary infant injuries deaths if people don't completely understand instructions . let not talk styling ... wasn't black , red gray popular 80 or i miss come back somewhere ... i hope i find something better ... i'm giving this product two stars because it job ... but i expect much more product	-1
i very disappointed this mirror . i gave it 2 stars instead 1 because i use mirror . i 2000 vw passat headrest middle seat so i no problem installing it . it great watch my little one while i drive . i see other reviewer point it safety issue because you kind get obsessed watching your baby you should keep your eyes road . however , it never obstructed my view all . i registered this because remote control feature . well , remote control only turns unit off you keep switch unit " " ( remote control access mode ) order it work . there switch unit play music or turn lights play music . you cannot control feature remote control . you also cannot control volume remote . it really pain . i'm keeping it because i like mirror but i'm not happy it . save your money buy safefit baby sight mirror .	-1
it very difficult attach it anything . straps short under strange angel . my son not play it	-1
i purchased this toy my son when he 4 months old . first , he seemed little intimidated toys , would cry when i put him it . once he got used it , he really enjoyed it . now he plays all toys , he likes it wobbles around . his favorite toy seems sun counting beads . i not experience problem feet others wrote . just lucky i guess . seat really hard remove washing , which why i gave it 4 stars instead	1
i ( more importantly , my twin boys ) really like this jumper . it seems safer than doorway jumper , mainly because their fingers won't get mushed . i like it multiple height settings it sturdy frame . they love jump it , before they able crawl , it one few ways them get out some excess energy get some exercise . plus , it nice safe place times when i'd like get something without keep constant eye one babies . cons ( wouldn't keep me buying it again ) : it takes up more room than doorway jumper , rattly bear pretty loud , music obnoxious . there on-off switch two volume settings music , though	1

our son got these blocks when he 2 months old . my husband enjoyed them more first , but time our son 5 months old he loved playing these ! he probably couldn't hold them well until he 5 months old , so why he enjoyed them more this age than earlier . 10 months , he still enjoys playing them . they lasted through " both " children . i would highly recommend these blocks infants , so far even into toddler age , he enjoys playing them	1
these blocks contain everything you could want toy . each different textures , images , something unique it . -the yellow block duck one side " quacks " when pressed . other side sun whose face flips up reveal tiny mirror . side picture some bananas clear plastic over them make interesting texture yet side contains circle motif . -the red block rattles , picture robin (?) one side , square pattern motif side , picture strawberries . -the green block frog 3d legs one leg pull toy cause block shake . it also picture green apple ( mine , least , although this picture shows leaf ) , silky fabric leaf prints , triangle motif . -the blue block rattle . it picture turtle one side , some jeans made real denim , star motif . -all blocks side color name ( i bought mine target , they name english , spanish , french although these pictured only show it english ) . rest sides filled textured fabrics such soft , fluffly fur or bumpy texture ( like material found bottom some slippers prevent skidding ) . my three month old loves look these blocks i rub different sides against her skin while saying " soft " , " smooth " , or " bumpy " she loves feelings . my friend daughter , who five months , loves pick up throw down blocks . it one her favorite games . i'd reccomend these blocks must any infant	1

we bought two different kinds gates our living room area . we bought kidco configure gate kidco elongate . elongate cover area 84 " . elongate only go straight across opening . it extension screwed together overlap . so gate not actually straight across . we very disappointed this purchase wished we bought two configure gates . took us some time screw extension then screw supports then mark it wall . took us over hour . configure gate pricey side . we almost not buy it . but it two different size extension pieces you bend configure it space you need . we use it bottom our stairs it bows out give you area so gate not up against stairs . it so easy add extension piece . you just snap out pole add extension piece . you bend gate different ways fit opening . mount wall you just mark screw holes screw plate then snap gate . it mounted wall less then 20 minutes . it very sturdy . i highly recommend this gate .	1

i actually bought this netting use cover our baby cradle ( we two cats didn't want them nap it while baby wasn't it ) . i've used it once my pak ' play while outside but found it especially useful when my daughter fell asleep her jogging stroller after walk our neighborhood . since it such nice day i let her nap stroller(it fully reclines ) netting covering entire stroller . i feel , such low price , this netting worth it whatever reason you chose use it	1

not sure what all fuss regarding assembly . i just unpacked assembled it few minutes ago no trouble . assemble probably too strong word , there no actual assembly or tools involved . weight , maybe 15 pounds , certainly nowhere near 50 . instructions seemed sufficient although i didn't really need use them . basically , if fear difficult assembly reported here your only concern , don't let stand way choosing this item .	1
i bought this product because it two most important things i am looking : portable splash guard . my son feels very comfortable it he using this since last august when we got it . parts all plastic easy cleaning . cushion part seat splash guard all one piece , unlike some other potty seat where splash guard attachment . so that very easy clean . entire potty disembled cleaned sanitized inside out , no hard reach spots . seat soft contoured oval opening which best , unlike lot potty i found circular small opening . seat put adult toilet seat which i started training my son after several use avoid cleaning bowl . only thing i wish this product comes just seat without bowl , then would even better !	1

this seems like really sturdy , lightweight stroller . i just wanted something simple strong get us out house quickly -- we live very hilly , sort rustic area , so i needed something i could take my son park without hauling out big buggy . this really light , it folds carrying strap case boy wants walk bit . ( there also storage bag travel . ) tires treads them , so they handle steep terrain , they give pretty smooth ride over bumps . fabric sort thick canvas-sy polyester -- not removable , but it seems like it could easily scrubbed/hosed clean if necessary . seat also some padding back support ( although , con side , it probably not coolest compared mesh ) . weight limit given 37 lbs , so my 19-month old still plenty room grow -- his shoulders comfortable his feet don't reach footrest yet ( he 27 pounds 33 inches tall ) . plus side , it seems bigger than wrangler all-weather umbrella stroller , plus it reclines bit ( you unzip/unbutton sides allow fabric unfold ) , unlike volo . square canopy maybe not greatest ( it only covers face , could actually sit little higher i think) -- but everyone complaining it falls off , i found when you flip canopy back , if you then detach back flap seat , you attach side flaps velcro back keep it sliding off . some people also mentioned kicking wheels , but i'm 5'6 " haven't any problems -- i think it matter not standing right top thing since it umbrella stroller doesn't superwide wheelbase . i would give it 4.5 stars i think , but am giving 5 because great price ! i'm pretty happy this -- my son constantly trying climb , so he must like it too ... i figure money we saved , we buy nice kettrike or some other form transportation boy grow into .	1
we bought this tub because our son struggled bath seats . he too big infant bath tubs but certainly couldn't handle full size version . this tub perfect option . only thing could make this product better slip resistant bottom tub	1

finally ! big , spacious , nice looking toy box !! i looked long time toy box could set out our family room still blend rest decor , but bigger than little wooden toy boxes out there ! lid finally improved old ones where lid never stayed up . drawers bottom small , but hold few things , don't take anything away big interior box . it makes box look more sofisticated !! love new colors design . thanks little tikes !	1
used infantino front carrier several hours day until my back started hurt . purchased ultimate baby wrap based reviews here . i liked idea even weight distribution able put baby different positions . while using wrap isn't intuitive ( ie watch dvd ) it easy learn . my back problems gone baby more snug wrap ( tummy tummy ) than traditional front carriers . i wanted use sling position but baby too big length width wise . only gripe there no neck support tummy tummy position so i hold baby head while i rock her sleep . would recommend this product , great price too	1
this great young babies .. once my son became more active ( which when it safe use regular crib bumper anyway ) he would put his legs it it would scrunch down since it very thin - unlike big padded more sturdy bumpers come w/ crib set . i think only flaw but i definitely use it again my next infant/baby	1
this protects our leather seats well but much wider than infant carrier base which crowds other passengers sitting next baby . otherwise good product .	1
i like this because it nice construction . i bought white it blends nicely . i just wish it little higher . we newer construction home bathroom counters high so it still too low her wash hands herself now .	1
i really like how this step designed stay place . we cheaper plastic stool bathroom tends scoot too easily our son climbs up it . this one stays put ! only reason this stool didn't get 5 stars me because textured top . it little difficult clean . since this potty step stool , it gotten some messes it i wish would easier get rid	1
after using smaller plastic tub blow up tub , this one best ! i only wish i would've just bought this one begin . my little guy 6 months old , 24 pounds but can't sit up yet . he still uses side lays him down water , he loves it ! don't waste your money other tubs , this one best . this one grow your child while saving water too	1
i bought this carrier recent trip my family took i am so glad i it ! i used it my 8 month old carry her around instead using stroller . there many pockets which plenty room store all your needed items stand works well set down ground when not wearing it . my daughter seemed quite comfortable it one point even fell asleep . she loved able see everything around her our level . i am 5'3 " my husband 6'1 " we both wore it comfortably . i would recommend this item anyone needing something smaller than stroller	1
my baby now 5 months old , we've using halo sleep sac since she started moving around more . i always worried regular blanket because more than few times she would wake up crying because she kicked her regular blanket onto her face ! now , i never worry she soffocate or she cold middle night . this product really gives me peace mind i'll sure give this any new parent friends	1
it expensive but worth it . it nice take work because it looks professional ( many people didn't even know what it ) it comes cooler so i didn't put my milk fridge next everyone lunch . friend also bought one around same time says she got it much cheaper ebay brand new one .	1
this so much better than any potty chair , it never way ! very easy put my daughter loves it ! she ahs potty trained year but my nephew who just now potty training loves it also !!	1
this fit very easily into my daughter graco infant car seat . other reviewers said , it very convenient keeps my daughter nice warm . wind not seemed problem , but then i only carry her car my destination it . i would recommend this friend	1
i wouldn't call this " rocker seat " kick-stand it makes it look like rocker , if you put stand down .. legs almost touch floor . you make it move little if you wood floors , but not enough call it rocker . if you very mellow baby , this chair perfect . my baby likes sit stare toys . but if you need any type movement your baby stay calm , i wouldn't recommend this chair . music/sounds it very nice , not annoying all . i don't use vibration it yet , until my baby itch his cheeks if needed . only reason i say 4 stars not 5 because it falsely advertised " rocker " , other than , it very cute , my baby enjoys it alot !	1
i don't generally write reviews but wanted praise baby trend design this car seat . we directed it after january 07 consumer reports review showing this one only two infant car seats pass their more stringent crash tests ( tv news showed alarming video various car seats flying around passenger compartment after struck vehicle ) . compared our still-new safety 1st seat , this one so much better engineered number ways : 1 ) base super easy install . click twice into each car two anchor points , then tug each two straps tighten base . that it . our old seat paragraphs confusing directions didn't leave me confident this one . 2 ) base easily adjustable tilting mechanism leveling indicator insure you get right angle baby head ( no flopping ) . our old seat no such system - we used rolled-up towels . 3 ) seat dial quickly adjust seat height baby grows . no such system our old seat . 4 ) handle ergonomic triangle shape top more secure grasp when reaching into car left or right . 5 ) if base not available , seat strapped directly into car using car lap belt . 6 ) seat overall more narrow than our old seat , allowing our two other kids fit back seat little more breathing room . every inch helps . 7 ) seat lighter than our old seat , although it feels just secure solid old one . all this , seat same price our old one . unfortunately amazon/target sold out when consumer reports issue came out , but i found them stock online wally world , if you looking get one quickly . one sale here better color combo than wally , unless you like lime green - but seats themselves all same superb design . summary : super easy install adjust , well thought-out features , fair price ! makes me want more kids just buy more these :	1
i tried several different bottles my daughter these worked wonderfully us . we actually came across them when walmart stopped carrying parent choice anti colic bottles we using which similar design . these bottles really seem decrease amount air my daughter takes while she feeding . this blessing she problems gas since birth . she also reflux . i can't tell you if bottles major factor her improvement area because she now meds . however , i think they've helped bit . they also comfy hold me . i've read lot reviews talk leaking . i this problem once because i heated bottle valve system it . so , i learned not so not problem since . they bit pricy , but i believe you get what you pay . lastly , i don't think small parts difficult wash . yes , it bit more time consuming if you don't dish washer , but us , it well worth extra time	1
i purchased this despite reviews i read , out desperation ! but very happy fit my eddie bauer morgan gingham playard bassinet . it little thin , however , i use carter mattress pad underneath anyway , so i am not concerned absorbancy . it job nice surface lay my son head , i purchased one more navy switch out when it laundry time	1

i bought this set gift , but also received it gift myself ( my registry ) . although my daughter two half now , i would recommend playtex nursers everyone ! they sanitary cause less gas than conventional bottles . i definitely like drop-ins liners better than traditional ones ... convenience standpoint , paired fact they work so well breast milk storage system . i'm not planning any more children , but i don't dare part these bottles yet . they stored my basement future use , either my myself or family members . they also helped make transition breast bottle sippy cup breeze	1

due room layout , i needed double bed rail would protect both sides bed . we don't live near store lot choices after reading many online product descriptions decided we going need look several these " person " then decide which one best fit our needs . so we purchased 4 brands bed rails . after looking more detailed information box trying two them out , we decided keep safe secure double bedrail first years . help others , i attached two customer photos this product description . these photos sketches photos side box better describe bed rail . why amazon/target can't get least much information their website than side box frustrating me . but seems happen many times . this bedrail took 30 minutes assemble side panels 45 minutes fully assemble unit bed . this line time other model we tried out took . reasons why we liked this bed rail best follows :( 1 ) it double bed rail designed protect both sides bed . ( 2 ) this only model we looked where both sides folded down making mattress pad sheet changes feasible . ( 3 ) quality construction ( especially spring loaded locking pins ) much better than sleeptite bed rail we looked regalo one step ahead ( which also made regalo . )( 4 ) design made more sense than regalo . installation more straightforward . possible issues this bed rail follows :( 1 ) it only 17 " high , so measure your mattress make sure it fit . our case , our mattress not pillowtop 10-11 " high , depending where you measure it . so we still satisfied height rail above our mattress . but i could see where if you tall mattress this would issue . ( 2 ) this easiest rail pull up unlock fold down . others more substantial locking mechanisms . i could see where toddler who watched you this , could then it himself . so we planning not doing this front our toddler , only during sheet changes . only you know how inquisitive your own child these things how much problem this would . despite these two issues , we decided good points outweighed bad this bedrail best choice us . however , if we later disappointed this bed rail , i go update our review .	1
i own this blanket just bought ! i brought this blanket my playgroup park . it perfect damp grass big enough me , my daughter , all our stuff . few other moms liked it so much they bought it too . my baby spits up quite bit , especially during tummy time , so i decided buy one use house . it cleans so easily baby wipe or damp cloth . great investment	1

i love this product . i 5 month old twins born 6 weeks early . i swaddled them receiving blankets when they came home nicu they loved sleeping way . i stopped swaddling them 2 months because i could see they no longer liked it . my night nurse told me continue swaddle them night up year . she said it would help them sleep through night . i bought this product while my girl boy twins didn't like it first they go sleep faster stay asleep longer when they wearing them . not long after i started using this product my son slept 7 7 . what dream ! he getting better getting least one arm out but even when he he still sleeps better then when he not swaddled all . i found it works better when i put them it when they drowsy because then they don't lay their crib trying get out it before they fall asleep . we don't use them during day now . i always give this baby gift going forward	1
i love this item . it life saver . around 4-6 weeks , my baby would only sleep if held or laying his side next me after breastfeeding . since it impossible hold baby all night laying next me his side " no , no " sids , i looking something could help me get him sleep his bassinet his back suggested prevent sids . i tried swaddling my baby blankets , but after few weeks he figured out how get out it . i also didn't like he could undo blanket it loose around his face , " no , no " sids . so i bought these swaddle me blankets fasten easily velcro . shortly after we started using swaddle me , he started sleeping through night , occasionally waking up 15 minute feeding ( which i keep him swaddled ) then he falls right back sleep i carefully pick him up put him back bassinett rest night . he 4 months old now we're still using them .... buy few , because if we wets himself , which boys lot , you'll need one switch him into	1

i say up front i use gate bottom stairs not top product suggests . gate built well ... simple functional . it optional ability restrict direction movment hinges give great angle movment detach easily . it went up easy works designed . it just tiny bit awkward reach latch release pull back gate but this very minor issue . similar vien , you line up bottom rail same time you line up top rail order close . my guess it would less awkward if used top stairs recommended . overall i would recommend gate both locations stairs	1
we bought this swing our 11 month old daughter , she loves it ! we attached it our back porch easily enough , she swings it every day ! we've it month it still her favorite toy ! only issue we it hangs slightly crooked because way they put hooks swing factory . aren't both facing same direction , which something we cant fix , but it isn't bad enough not use swing or cause any problems . its more irritating than anything . also , swing seems secure safe . we've not any issues safety , or even any close calls	1
we gone through few packages table toppers we love them ! our toddler went trying peel them off table helping us stick them down .... she loves pull paper strips off adhesive .... she doesn't try pull mat off table until she finished eating . we finally found shopper toppers toys us i so excited i bought two packages .... they don't work worth anything ! adhesive those down sides , not across top where it should , stick shopping cart handle .... fact we've decided table toppers work better shopping cart than ones made shopping cart . also , only shopper topper our bag while out lunch recently , we used it table it worked just well ones made table ! well	1

i love these little books ... they play music .. good before bed , my girls chew them ( which makes both me my two year old son happy ) ... just fantastic ... great buy	1
my sister who 4 kids insisted i buy this boy she right ! those you who say it takes time snap it off aren't thinking what you change crib sheet . first all , bumper removed just get mattress any reasonable fashion that pain tie off . especially when you get it there just right . then you lift up mattress get sheet bottom pull it over corners . i mention moving mattress causes cute little dust ruffle get out poistion ? ugh , i don't think so . i'd much rather deal few straps snaps then my daughter sit soaking sheet ( this pad wicks away moisutre ) go through so much trouble change it . far " imprint " her face , i haven't noticed any she hasn't bothered	1
but , there 2 things i don't like . one toys hanging bar too low . my sons knees hit it he only 6 weeks old . second continuous play songs , don't actually continually play . it actually pauses 1-2 minutes . my son fall asleep music , then it pauses starts up again , waking him . i love vibration feature , which main reason i bought it . all all , it worth it	1
i worried this looked cheap , too sterile hospital-like my new baby , but it much more attractive person . safetly 1st needs new photo taken this crib , theirs looks dated . it arrived took less than five minutes assemble , myself 8 months pregnant ! completely assembled except sliding four leg castors into place lifting bars open position . click- ! two adjustable height settings , comes nice mattress . i would not order one . this very soft suitable . this rolls easily pack play bedding fits it perfectly . eddie bauer sheets target come fleece fabric extremely soft , love it ! my crib skirt large crib fits adjustments i love way it turned out . fact i can't believe this one cheapest alternatives , since i would say it nicer than wooden mini-cribs i saw person local store . i 24 month old i not want two cribs , but i also not want rush her into toddler bed . we bought one , but she doesn't want stay it night . she feels safe sleeps well her crib . this crib stable fine our second child until older baby out her crib . this great product very reasonable too !	1
[ ... ] it def . ... very sturdy , doesn't move around once you strap it chair it looks good too :) i'm very happy this chair - contoured seat back really hugs baby yet doesnt constrict his arms ... i love size tray size cupholders . i find it very easy hand wash bottom only needs good rinse ... my son hasn't gotten food under there yet ... i can't wait use it booster seat :	1

i love this pillow . i've it two half months now . first it helped me stay my side , just comfy snuggle up . now my belly getting bigger , it gives great support doesn't let my belly " hang " down . this great people who don't always sleep their sides once you position it you unlikely roll over your sleep . i've no problem stuffing . if you looking super firm support , try wedge . this pillow , feels such . course , if you budget , you always just use regular pillow , but if you want pamper yourself unique shape this pillow makes it extra comfortable . ** update ** i'm now 8 months pregnant love my pillow ! mine came covered zippered cover , so what i wash . every few nights , i just grab larger part shake it hard until stuffing falls down , then fluff it it good new . i also like , yes , it take up some room , but no where near much room many pregnancy pillows . all all , whether you like this pillow or not come down personal choice	1
this great potty boys . we some problems accidents some other brands but this one keeps what should happen potty , potty . easy clean , too	1
i twin boys 3 i love this chair . it doesn't lid or removable splash gurad . i two other sets chairs twins only play . putting lids up down , taking out removable seat catch basin , etc . this simply constructed unit no corners or edges . it smooth contours including splash guard not come off attached catch basin . catch basin combination seat/emptying pail which enables you easily remove empty . it easily cleaned because simple design less appealing play . i think best feature smooth built splash guard which you need boys . this seat not convert toilet seat bathroom toilet , which i think doesn't work anyway - other potty chairs i purchased seats slide flop when you put it real toilet then becomes unsafe . i recommend babybjorn toilet trainer	1
i love this product . all new mothers should include this their registry , how we've lived without it this long , i'll never know ! it wonderful safety product overlooked until now	1
this works great our chicco capri stroller . it took bit trial error get it perfect place so stroller would close . however , once i figured out , it great . i could take accessories off just put them when needed . swivel great concept . i actually wish it came third clasp so baby could cup holder snack holder ( one each side ) mommy could her water bottle clip . we just switch them out baby or they hold their sippy handles .	1
i used this product all three my children it great . easy use quick sterilise . regard previous comments not sterlising equipment , i should point out there difference clean sterile . all babies vulnerable germs cause diarrhoea vomiting , so it best continue sterilising bottles teats ( breast pump equipment ) until your baby one year old built up more resistance bacteria generally . cleaning your baby bottles teats dishwasher not always heat them right temperature kill off all known bugs , so it generally still advisable sterilise after washing . if you want rely your dishwasher alone , it needs run hot programme minimum temperature 80 degrees centigrade . bottles then need filled feed straight away dishwasher not leave them completely sterile condition . it may seem pointless sterilise feeding equipment when your baby crawling around floor putting all sorts things his mouth , but bugs stick milk curds dangerous . your baby immune system grow stronger into second year he'll able combat infections more easily . it might seem inconvenient some , but sterilising reduces your baby chances ingesting harmful bacteria it baby health , not what mother feels she doesnt time .	1
whoever designed this toy really understands mind toddler . my grandaughter took this instantly it became her favorite activity . yes , activity . time when so many toys designed keep child one place this one gets them up moving ; no moving , no peek-a-boos ! it contributed significantly her becoming steady her feet building healthier baby . good value any price	1
this sensor all peace mind . we've using it few weeks now it gone off twice - scaring us , but making us glad we it . both times its gone off , our daughter very tightly swaddled , so we think made her breathing shallow thus set off alarm . you change sensitivity it , but default setting should fine . there bit background noise or static you hear . my husband solved issue placing piece regular household tape bottom few speaker holes . it still loud enough us hear her without extra noise . it take some getting used - you turn off sensor put it sound only mode whenever you remove baby crib , otherwise sensor go off . but this `inconvenience ' totally worth peace mind this sensor gives you . i believe they sell this only one parent unit - but you really want get two . leave one bedroom keep other mobile - we constantly move second kitchen bonus room , living room , etc . this sensor amazing product worth every penny .	1
there two types dekor refill , one regular one ' plus ' . sizes different you better sure order right one .	1

our daughter started fighting diapers when she only 6-7 months old , so fit desperation , i bought this potty , put her it never looked back . it helped potty really comfortable , wide , flat bottom left no marks her tush , stable enough so there no accidents . i only give it 4 stars because i really could not snap seat toilet because whole construction so darn plasticky . ah , music never worked ( no loss my opinion , i there encouraging ) training book seemed bit cheesy . toddler may also entertain thoughts removing easily accessible container while sitting , which may lead whole new set problems . but overall , this potty made our lives so easy during potty training , i cannot but lavish praise over this little piece plastic	1

this product great first few weeks after we brought baby home . while others said velcro very loud late night diaper changes , i found i could keep it velcro'd top just slip her legs out through bottom . my daughter really liked this , but quickly outgrew it . just one month old she didn't want her arms tied down , so usefullness product limited . baby who loves swaddled , this indispensible item . i'll pass mine our hand-me-downs . you never tell which baby want swaddled	1
first , i must say this sling absolute lifesaver when my ( somewhat colicky ) son newborn . no matter how fretful his mewling , when we swaddled him placed him this sling , he would fall asleep . because he otherwise rarely slept those early weeks , he spent good deal time it . three aspects design great : 1 . bottom padded so you lay baby hard surface use sling changing pad ; 2 . sides high drawstrings allow sling opened up almost flat ; 3 . it grows your baby -- my tiny baby hated fron t-t ype bjorn carriers , but loved this still likes it . one aspect design , me , dreadful -- shoulder strap ! it should wider padded . i tried repositioning it every which way no matter what i , strap dug into my shoulder . end i just put thick mitten under strap my shoulder . good use mitten that lost it mate , but i would rather better strap	1

i think everyone should one these , especially when their kids young . my 8mo . old tries eat everything . i don't want him chewing handlebars grocery cars ( yuck ! ) it makes it much cleaner when you put him highchair restaurants ( which sometimes disgusting ) . best part it fits over extra large shopping carts club stores , like [ ... ] , unlike other types	1
we bought our floppy seat when our baby boy 6 months old . even though he still little " floppy " himself when it came sitting up , floppy seat supported him . he now 18 months old , it still going strong ! although , now he wears " real " shoes , leg openings tend get caught then . it took little practice get hang threading belt through cart , but now it so fast ! we also use it every time we go out eat . matter fact , one ( only ) time we forgot bring it , our son started choke while sitting restaurant highchair . belt buckle old restaurant chair became stuck , would not open , after multiple attempts ! we forced turn whole chair sideways order proceed clear his airway . he fine , but we all shaken up ! if we'd our ( familiar ) floppy seat cover , we would able help our son few moments faster . every second counts !	1

true -- other reviewers stated , this not gate swing open unless you use hardware , which i not , so i cannot comment how well works . tension or pressure-mounted gate , i love this item . i no problems stepping over it -- i'm only 5 ' 5 " -- so i never found it nuisance . it easy use one hand snaps into place easily . it also easy adjust size fit different sized door openings , although takes two hands . it light enough i carry my 13-month old son one arm gate other i travel floor floor . my 2 year old learning sleep room herself so we use gate doorway so she call us her room without free wander into hallway or onto stairs . again , we love fact we don't damage molding doorframes . my husband i so satisfied this item we plan buying one	1
this chair larger than some seats out there , fits my average-sized 2 1/2 year old boy very well . some seem like they would really hard boy use , things tend spray out smaller seats ! seat shaped just right splashes , it seems comfortable . now if only my little guy would use it more than once day , we'd business ! i love simple design , my son loves color ( he picked it out himself ) , it so simple clean . it also grips bottom so it won't slide bathroom floor when he sits it -- must	1
i am totally fan cloth diapering now i've actually it . i must admit i very apprehensive before i actually used them because i thought it would so much work , but it really amounts doing load laundry every other day ... not hard . these diaper covers fantastic . i not single leak them . when my daughter first born , friend gave us several packs newborn disposable diapers we used first few weeks , we numerous leaks . we actually used newborn size super whisper wrap first two months small size now . she 6 pounds 11 ounces when she born . i use chinese prefold diapers them . i tried two different types gerber prefold , but they're just not absorbant quickly saturated . what sold me these covers how i wash them diapers when they soiled i don't hand wash them or anything	1

this chair very sturdy we keep it attached our table my son only high chair . i love how little space it takes up compared conventional high chair . however , i bought this chair because 9 months my son would climb out anything . i thought chair nothing under his feet might give him less leverage . even shoulder straps tight they go , he wiggle out it stand up chair . if you looking downsize your baby accessories you don't climber - this chair you , but if you escape artist - this chair no better than typical high chairs	1
i discovered this product recently when i my second baby . i received it baby shower gift i love it . it so much easier than swaddling blanket . i now bought large one my son ( 3mos ) yet figure out how get out it . other thing i like it you wrap wings around baby waist or upper chest , leave his arms out , use it during day like blanket . voila , blanket won't fall off when you're holding him , or kicked off when he lying down . kiddopotamus really come up some great products . you might also want check out piddle pad . great invention/product kiddopotamus	1

i bought this product after reading many positive reviews below , i thoroughly satisfied . my only complaint actually my luggage , handle my bag little short so i stoop little while i pushing/pulling it . everyone who saw it thought it neatest invention ever , especially other moms traveling kids . strap so simple it genious - just strap carseat go ! it bit hassle restrapping security , but everything hassle security . just make sure you few extra minutes get everything back together it fine . this great product made what could very difficult trip breeze . bravo !	1
sizes perfect , especially small one my 5 month old . suction works fine so far , but we see baby gets older	1
finally found this item ! i couldn't find this anywhere locally . it easy kids use it easy clean	1
pupsqueak wonderful . i am picky mother toys . i hate toys too loud , too commercial , too cheesy , too useless ... i high standards . but pupsqueak gets my " picky mom seal approval " wholeheartedly . here why . i am very blessed mother who loves send my children lots goodies . while it easy know what send 4-year-old distinct likes interests , it harder gauge what twelve-week-old baby enjoy . we no shortage toys gadgets entertain our new daughter , she clearly enjoys some them , kicking legs , cooing , , waving arms , etc . pupsqueak , however , took it different level . she loves this thing . we showed it her around 11-12 weeks old , she immediately reacted . she laughed , she kicked , all signs . then , she reached little black white patterned bone hangs down . we so excited , she it attached bar her carseat ever since . real test , however , our 10-hour drive louisiana kentucky thanksgiving holidays . but pupsqueak came through us flying colors : anytime she would get fussy , i could reach back shake him bit so he would jingle softly , she would happy again . after my arm would get tired , i'd make sure he adjusted where she could get him , she would , not yet 4 months , bat it herself . pupsqueak wonderful toy soft , gently jingle young babies funny bark even makes my four-year-old laugh older babies . he definitely top dog my book	1
this great carseat carrier . easy install level indicator . few drawbacks : once my daughter few months old , it got really heavy carry around . she also outgrew it 6 months . harness needs longer . it doesn't release enough get taller babies out comfortably . some reason , release levers move handle get baby out really stiff difficult use . my mother law arthritis ended up either carry carseat both arms like bundle wood ( because she couldn't move handle up ) or try slide my daughter out top or bottom ( because she couldn't move handle back ) . my advice , before you buy , realisticly test everything it store compare it directly brand	1
this seat wonderful . my daughter can't quite sit her own yet , but this keeps her secure comfortable . make sure you loop belt around your child cart or high chair . this seat small very easy use ; it great product	1
i've using this pump ten months now it main reason i'm still nursing my little girl . i went back work when she four months old started pumping three times per day . first it hard try productive 20 minutes per session i pumping because you really hold breast shield breast , suction isn't enough . then i got easy expression hands-free bustier which solved problem . i now e-mail , talk conference calls , etc . while i'm pumping so i don't waste time work continue give my baby benefits human milk . i'm able fit four standard bottles two smaller/slimmer medela bottles into small cooler , ice pack so i don't think cooler too small . also , i don't think cooler meant transported backpack . if you don't try cram cooler backpack there no problem storage backpack . i also reccomend medela micro-steam bags working moms who choose pump once they go back work . also , i don't think suction too hard ... yes it may uncomfortable first minute or two until pressure engorgement reduced , but it no means painful . pain what i experience when my daughter bites her new razor-sharp teeth !	1
i am so greatfull this pump ! i able exclusively breastfeed two children year each , while working full time , taking vacations ( without kids ) , etc . i also car adapter which awesome , i able pump my work , ( which over hour away ) , while driving . i only recommend breatfeeding/pumping pros ! warranty only good year , but mine now three years old still going strong . we expecting our third child i hope my pump holds up year , if not i still probably spend money pump like this one ! best luck	1
my son wearing halo sleep sack since day he came home hospital . winter baby it best thing world know he would warm not worry loose blankets . he began sleeping through night 7 weeks old . i think sleep sack gives him feeling security . he never able sleep without it . he now 30 months old still won't go sleep unless he his sleep sack . we friend ours who seamstress add additional material bottom because he became tall it . how much he loves his sleep sack . it far best thing i ever bought my son	1
my son very picky eater but loves elmo . this set adorable practical . he loves spoon getting his food off plate bowl . th eonly thing ware -- it gets very hot microwave . even if you just put it 20 seconds , it must cool dow	1
we struggled 2 different monitors before we got imonitor graco . first 2 we tried so much static interference they useless . i can't explain how delighted my wife i hook up this monitor hear nothing but sounds our baby . it better than christmas morning when we kids !!! we wireless internet , cell phones , cordless phones , basically if its electronic we got it . despite all potential interfence graco delivers chrystal clear sound absolutely no interference . must buy any parent	1
when i my daughter i no clue where begin breast pads so i bought several different types . friend gave me these my baby shower because they here favorite . i wish i never wasted money other pads . i change these pads more often than some other brands . it worth it because they so much more comfortable . i didn't any chaffing like most others . also they stayed place ten times better than any pads adhesive .	1
bought 2 different monitors ; this one great features such motion sensor , auto scan settings . night vision weak but daytime looks great . better reception than other video monitor i bought but not good night vision drawback . i really bought video monitors keeping eye my mother who alzheimers but using 2 cameras comes handy both baby mom . none these seem quiet just regular baby monitor without video but it very comforting see not just hear . it best one i've found market	1
my husband purchased this bag me when i recently took trip solo my daughter . it seemed more troublesome than helpful . i ended up using backpack strap pull bag because i could not pull using regular strap comfortable positition . 1st flight bag ripped seam bottom scraping floor . when i arrived my destination i restitched bag thought maybe i careless my handling . return flight we more walking since airport little bigger , though it still small airport . when i arrived my destination bag completely separated bottom stitch my car seat base scratched mared result . damage bag so bad i never use it again . this bag should labeled disposable . though this good concept there needs better planning overall design quality . i would not recommend this product think twice before purchasing any other products this manufacturer	1
we like this stroller . it seems pretty durable , its weight portability ( shoulder strap ) make it ideal trips , especially airports . my husband hard time pushing it sometimes because he so tall ( 6'4 " ) , but it fine me ( 5'3 " ) . we like it our 5-month-old son because he able recline , but still sit up enough watch what going . he hold his head up well but isn't sitting up unsupported yet , so various levels reclining back nice . overall , good stroller price	1
put together well nice assortment items bag , nice gift all itself expectant mo	1
car seat itself awesome , but condition it arrived awful . box smashed caved it exposed rain or moisture some kind . there nothing covering seat ( like plastic bag ) so debris gotten into box soiled material seat . it gift my grandson christmas so i didn't time return it hope timely return . it took alot time effort clean spots off seat . simply packing seat plastic bag over it would made alot more sense me .	1
i am sure this good stroller ( that why i bought it ! )my " review " more word caution : this thing takes forever arrive . don't fooled : " usually ships within 24 hours " really means " may ship sometime " . 2/8/06 , our stroller not arrived . it ordered january 1 , 2006 . it not even slated ship week ( we'll see ... ) . meanwhile , local store several stock . my advice anyone trying time this gift or trip or other occasion : go your local store . otherwise , prepared wait very long time .	1
if you ipod or mp3 player , i'd recommend getting this . i think baby going love it ! i bought it last week , tested it out ( our baby hasn't born yet ) . speakers plenty loud enough baby crib or room imo , i'm 1/2 deaf . i also like little nightlight it changes color . my only criticism it takes batteries ( no ac adapter ) . we may invest rechargeable set batteries if it uses batteries up quickly . $20 , i think it great	1
just love it ! i jeep tandem it nice until my son got so big ( 40 lbs , 39 inches ) you couldn't steer it very well . bob amazing ! i 3 yr 1 yr old . you can't feel weight difference . it rides so nicely . both my children very tall/heavy ( dense ) their age my eldest plenty room grow - which my biggest concern . my husband just loves shocks - go figure . it compacts nicely .... if you need it even more compact wheels come off snap stored seat . it amazing ! i'm so glad i purchased it . rei great price it ($400+/- ... tried ebay too but rei best . fun your stroller search good luck	1
when it comes using this your children you'd first know what your needs . i can't imagine it stopping any determined child without some reinforcing ; it would more like psychological barrier . but depending their temperament age it may good deter them getting things they shouldn't . i ordered this use my puppy . my case i don't problem her pushing it so i can't say how long it would last through . this price i quite happy quality it amazingly simply install .	1
this wonderful stroller . i large 35lb , 2yr old he very comfortable . great folding mechanism . folding easy i it one hand . nice pockets storage	1

this bin great cloth diapers . we love ours . keeps odors minimum holds day or two worth diapers -- which all i need because we wash every other day . our local babies us sells replacement deodisks ( or you buy them online cloth diaper vendors ) when one comes it loses it smell so you maintain freshness . it easy clean use pretty inexpensive	1
original nursers enabled me return work after long maternity leave . my baby wouldn't take bottle until i introduced brown rubber nipple . thanks mom	1
i bought this seat couple weeks ago my 2 month old nephew using it when i him until my son born june . i love look , style safety this seat . only thing i thought may problem way shoulder straps adjust height . my nephew 22 " he almost second last adjustment . also side impacts don't leave alot room head positioner newborns they far enough apart head room wobble side side . my nephew seems love it though seems really comfortable it . upright position something i like , i never seen him sweat it , he seems growing room , canopy covers him fine , i think it most comfortable carry . his parents using eddie bauer i know alot people ( including me past ) use graco other brands they seem roomier , but not safe . also i haven't seen baby over 4-5 months infant seats anyways , i don't know anyone would want lug around baby over 15 pounds infant seat , i guess that just few us who aren't body builders . my nephew 11 pounds now he getting pretty heavy seat , it good thing seat isn't too heavy itself . i would recommend this seat , but i can't explain other reviews , so mabey trying it out store best everyone	1
i very impressed every avent product i purchased . i found these pacifiers so nice . they completely clear you able see smiles around them . my baby loves hers . we can't live without them	1
medela breast pump works dr. brown bottles ( you pump directly into bottle) ! just added benefit already great product . i've using mine almost daily 11 months no problems . it worth money if you plan breastfeeding/pumping more than couple months	1
we've this bed rail two months now our 3 1/2 year old his full size " big boy bed " . we're quite satisfied it . construction : very sturdy , our son jumps his bed rolls around bed rail stays put not seem like it could possibly give way . mesh soft which good times when he wedges himself corner sleep . we tug it time time it not going anywhere . assembly : not too easy , instructions horrible , but once you realize your own how it supposed go , actual assembly ok , but not quick . very easy adjust width your bed simple strap feature . hide away feature : this what took away 5th star . it not very easy unlock push it under bed . feature works but requires some wrangling . if you want hide away feature once while , i wouldn't let stop you buying it , if you plan hide rail daily , i don't recommend it . making bed : easy tuck sheets around it , no need hide away or struggle . overall , i would highly recommend this bed rail , i read all reviews , asked many friends , this seemed best all areas , good value price , considering other well over $xx	1
i love it ! this probably one my most used baby items . it so handy use while we out so easy clean . i've bought this shower gift several my pregnant friends	1

good baby monitor overall . sound quality good except we getting occasional clicking sound i can't find where interference coming	1
if you going get manual pump , get this one . i got medela hospital it sooo slow killed my hand , but this one way better . it takes 5-10 minutes get same amount it took 30 minutes get medela , it doesn't hurt your hand all because you pump handle far less often because massaging petals , because you use it less time total . i never used electric pump so i can't compare it one those , but far manuals go this one awesome	1
so far our 7 month old son likes this toy . he watches flashing lights , listens music noises , seems like different shaped blocks ( we several other peek-a-boo blocks ) . he uses handle push bus , flips up shape sorter kicks wheels make music come . it keeps his attention while he practices sitting up long periods time . we thought first we broken one since only one light worked it didn't flash . well after my husband pounded light bar down each side both lights came started flashing . it also made hood stay shut better . so maybe try before taking it back store if you encounter same problem	1
i love it sticks doesn't slide . it great my 21 month old feel part family when we eat	1
my daughter loves kick blankets off during night i always worried she would get cold , especially very cold weather we so far this winter . i saw this knew it would perfect my little kicker girl ! she wears it every night now i know she stays warm throughout night . only suggestion i anyone thinking buying this , make sure you get right size length your little one . mine growing so fast i get bigger size soon just because she getting so long	1
our little guy sleeping comfortably his stroller first several months we brought him home . when we tried transition him crib , he startled large space would cry or sleep very poorly . he outgrew stroller , we tried think ways emulate coziness stroller inside his crib ( lots attempts - not easy task !! ) . he 5 1/2 months old we now use sleep nest crib well putting him larger sized swaddleme night . he loves closeness sleeps very soundly . sleep nest small enough cozy , but large enough him move comfortably . it fits very nicely into crib also portable which great since he enjoys go	1

we purchased this gate span opening near bottom our stairs it works very well . we this gate place since my son started crawling he yet breech perimeter . my husband installed it easily ( one end into stud wall , one end into oak stair banister ) it sturdy - even my son frequently shaking it middle , it shown no signs dislodging . i give it 4 stars out 5 because it not very attractive opening mechanism somewhat cumbersome ( tough guests figure out ) . but it definitely its job i would recommend this gate anyone long span cover	1
i love this item . it really works well february winter weather . i bought 4 snowsuits i haven't used one our newborn because snowsuits tedious . i am able put her her car seat , put blanket inside put hat her . forget suits mittens . i cover her cover she sleeps dark warmth soundly . also , it prevents people touching her all time because they can't see her when i cover her up . only problem this item didn't fit well newest peg perego infant car seats . i made it work , but it doesn't fit perfectly . it worked old peg perego car seat , but not newest one . i loved this item so much i've made it work , though . it isn't perfect , but it works . it actually so much better than peg perego cover , which came car seat . this cover made my life pretty easy . i found it easy put peg perego . i love color . it zips up easily . it soft . isabella seems like snuggle it . it comfy her . aware , though , i live salt lake city , ut . our winters mild . if you colder winters , you may want add snowsuit . still , it worth money ! i am glad i bought it .	1

we these straps all over our house ( every piece furniture taller than two feet ) , because we two " climbers . " there two occasions i know where these saved my eldest daughter injury , she climbed large pieces furniture . hardest part installing these finding them . we searched several local stores , little luck - few odd looks , salespersons didn't understand why we would want strap our furniture walls when we don't live earthquake zone . but trust me , once you find somewhere sells them , buy them up . once you see how well they work , you become addicted testing see if you tip your furniture - want them everywhere .	1
i bought this my reluctant potty-trainer , he used it once tried go it several times , but real blessing his 6-year-old brother using it . i one bathroom , one very messy boy who never lifts toilet seat . this saved me clean my toilet seat constantly or face unwelcome surprises . i check collection reservoir lot , though , because my older son " go " lot , big boys . flushing mechanism works well necessary part - it saves lot time you may spend scrubbing rinsing traditional training potty . plus , pee collects part potty child doesn't easy access , unlike trainer potty they pee , then stand up step or put their head when your back turned second ( i speak experience ) . makes it much more sanitary . only problems i've encountered my kids flushing it constantly ( mostly when it new ) , simultaneously filling collection reservoir draining water therefore creating two jobs me repeat every five minutes , fact my three-year-old still can't quite get it he can't sit it #2 , fact it just little off-balance , so unless you wall-mount it or lean it up against wall , you could icky mess . luckily , ours only fallen over when filled water	1

i like fact kidsline offers extra crib sheets go zanzibar theme am impressed quality these sheets ( i two , one came bedding set one purchased off my baby registry ) . they wash extremely well ( still looks new ) , soft fit mattress appropriately . however , i think $16.99 crib sheet bit pricey purchased other crib sheets match theme just nice . ( amy coe , sage green target $8.99 koala baby sage green $9.99 bru ) . since you need several crib sheets , i just don't feel price worth it this one .	1
while these aren't waterproof , they provide enough additional protection give you little more confidence going out house underwear . so soft , little more absorbent than gerber ones . they aren't trim fit some other brands , but my son really likes roomy feel	1

we 2 kids 2-bedroom apartment . when our 2nd child born , we put him our bedroom . there not much space there , so this portable crib great find ! we use it permanent crib until our son outgrows it . pros : saves space , folds , easy move room room ( wheels ) , really easy change sheets ( compared regular crib heavy matress ) . it also very neutral color style , so it fits really well other traditional furniture . cons : baby outgrow it 1 year , matress extremely thin ( 1 inch ! ) . we bought extra matress ( normal thickness ) $20 . find it , search " portable crib matress "	1
my wife i bought this item usual reasons . we washed them no problems fuzzballs or shredding . they're just soft sturdy they before we washed them , if not little softer . record , we washed them cold cycle other baby clothes . they went through drier hour lowest heat setting . anyway , i'm just writing review offset bad review . there nothing wrong pads we received , they what they're supposed -- get warm baby cold changing table	1
we just installed these this weekend our upstairs banisters - they're great . they're strong enough keep our 11-month-old baby falling through -- we pushed pulled them after getting them all fastened . i still intend watch him carefully when he up there , but these definitely protect him emergency . just sure follow directions -- tie them tightly !! they're not bad , looks-wise , either . i still see my spindles through netting so " look " stairway basically unchanged . course , looks less important than safety ! i think i'm going get these our outdoor deck , well . i'd recommend them	1
my baby used this since she 4 months old it sturdy wide base .. it height adjusters ... you recline it .. very secure safty belts but i make sure my babies hands nowhere near it when i buckle it thats only thing i dislike this highchair . i dont find it hard clean .. it comes two trays it wheels folds up definately worth money especially now because it sale .. i paid full price :(	1
we loved this product our little girl loved it even more ! we used it time she 4 months almost 10 months . we nice wide doorway we able put jumper . we never any problems fingers getting pinched or heads getting bumped . we believe her coordination better because she used this so often . just 14 months , she could jump both feet off ground . it quality product reasonable price . would highly recommend	1
i ordered 6 piece crib set plus other zanzibar items go it really pleased quality softness fabrics . it beautiful looks very nice cozy . i bigger crib later turns into twin bed , so what i make quilt bigger use fitted sheet make addition . i also used dust ruffle make bumper bigger some pillows which look great sofa i room .	1
i am first time expectant mother like most excited moms-to-be , i read pretty much all reviews every item i need register or buy baby . however , helpful hint i give comes my other half who already son used wipe warmer . he said wipe warmers heat bottom up ( heat all wipes ) waste money because time you get bottom wipes .... they dried out continuously reheated . they basically lose their moisture which defeats purpose wipe first place you end up throwing bunch them out without benefit using them first . we opted go this one because it seems smaller ( more convenient travel which we fair amount ) it heats just first few wipes which usually all you need diaper change . some mothers would say this not really necessary thing ( after all , babies lived through diaper use just fine before these things invented ) , but because our baby born during winter , i thought this would more use us . i gave this product four stars because we haven't tried it yet .... but just wanted pass helpful hint other mothers who interested practicality saving money hopefully not losing quality process	1
great organizing baby food your diaper bag . caution : not leak-proof , sure properly seal leftovers ! love slots hold spoons .	1
first time i used this shopping cart cover my daughter fell asleep ( need i say anymore) ? it fits nearly every shopping cart , it easy fold unfold , it gives me peace mind knowing all those shopping cart germs aren't coming home us ! well worth extra peace mind it gives me	1
my husband i received this changing table , 4-drawer chest monterey crib , gift our parents . we skeptical , because we wanted nursery affordable , yet not too flimsy . we pleasantly surprised once pieces put together . pieces coordinate beautifully nursery , take our soon-to-be-born infant into childhood . nicest part you don't spend thousands dollars nice nursery . my friends family constantly complimenting us how great pieces look how sturdy they . * only reason i rated this 4-stars instead 5 because two drawers rubbed together slightly once assembled . it very easily fixed adjusting drawer tracks , took 5 minutes . bottom line : if you looking beautiful , quality nursery affordable , this great choice	1
i decided this pump instead single because it saves time both sides once . this pump works very well i quickly get milk i need . i like there different levels suction fit my comfort . i gave it four stars because it little difficult change speeds adjust both hands occupied . sometimes one side looses suction while i am trying fix it other side looses suction because i remove my hand holding it place	1
i borrowed this pump mom who just used it 8 weeks she out work . i used it frequently ( least twice daily ) 5 months i pumped work . it always worked wonderfully . i never trouble let-down or supply . sometimes i filled both 8 oz . bottles 15-minute session ! unless you problems breastfeeding or milk supply , i can't imagine this pump not working great . i didn't any problems it whole time i used it	1
i love this bumper . it isn't thick like padded bumpers fits crib nicely , without bunching . price much more reasonable than $$ bumpers go bedding sets . mostly i feel secure my little one safe even if he rolls up edge railings . i know his arms legs won't get tangled railings , but he also breathe . great product . it cute too looks very nice white crib .	1
i purchased this my 17 month old son who normally sleeps crib . i told daycare he would entering uses cots . so figuring this would also good travel , i bought it . my son loves it ! whole thing like mesh beach chair . i put it together 8 seconds . removable fitted sheet comes it -is soft . entire thing easy wipe clean . it looks comfy . it says it good kids up 75lbs . 52 inches . ( good know ) my favorite feature how tiny it folds up - pretty light compared other cots . not nearly bulky , too ! nice royal blue colors	1
i bought this item based safety comfort reviews consumer reports i'd say reviews i read titan dead . my 7 month old very long his age he loves freedom this seat provides opposed cramped car seat we using . i also like fact he grows into toddler able sit forward i still use this seat - i wish i bought this seat get go	1
my son now 2 bottle baby . we atleast 10 different cups he always refused them screamed his bottle . lastnight we bought this terrific cup he not asked bottle yet ! i now putting bottles away good this time ! i ordering few more so we always one hand . they pricey , but if i wouldn't bought all other cups , i'd plenty money saved just buying these first place !	1
my baby now 5 months old , we've using halo sleep sac since she started moving around more . i always worried regular blanket because more than few times she would wake up crying because she kicked her regular blanket onto her face ! now , i never worry she soffocate or she cold middle night . this product really gives me peace mind i'll sure give this any new parent friends	1
this wonderful stroller . i'm so glad i took chance ordered it , sight unseen . i ordered red version , which much snazzier person than amazon picture . it fairly lightweight - much lighter than our graco model , but heavier than those cheap little umbrella strollers , nice sturdy . but it folds up umbrella fashion , so it won't take up too much room your trunk could carried , if necessary . it comes neat things like rain cover , sun shade , cold weather boot . rain shade covers neatly contained attachable pouch boot fits easily stroller baske t.t he canopy window , provides lots shade , even partially removable let breeze run through balmy day . coolest all , it built mesh pouch doesn't take up any room but still manages hold everything i need : sunscreen , hand sanitizer , wallet , keys , cell phone , sunglasses . it stretchy mesh , so if you don't anything it just lies flat against hood . but it plastic lining , so it waterproof ! also , it zips , so your things can't fall out aren't accessible your two year old , either . basket large enough medium sized diaper bag , although small bag would fit best , especially if you want keep boot there . best part everything snazzy . everything looks nice , materials feel great , it well designed . parts should removable/washable . it snap put together ( took just couple minutes ) everything locks into place smart way . it very easy fold unfold . also , it reclines beautifully easily , including into totally upright position . i became frustrated my graco model most upright position still too reclined our one year old . place where your child legs hang down neat . it adjustable , so it could stick straight out , hang down , or even flip up very little one ( maybe use boot ? ) ... your kid won't get weird stroller mark underside their little knees . it newer style which i notice most new strollers seem where you only clip two things buckle baby . my graco model ( purchased last year ) such complicated mess . you attach two things together one side , two things together other side , then connect each side into center . arg ! my son almost always fussed time i'd finished . also , he always sitting one straps , which easily became twisted . my husband still not figured out how this quickly . :) so this big improvement . it also comfy ! i can't vouch myself , course . but my son settles down into it looks perfectly comfortable . graco model , he ended up his legs flung over one side tray if he wasn't tightly belted he slouched down lot . few minor imperfections zooper twist . cupholder mesh bag attached handle . it works well standard water bottle or something , but one those giant mall-sized beverages might not so great . you easily remedy this investing good quality cup attachment , if important you . this stroller great me - i'm 5'5 . it would nice if stroller handles adjustable . this isn't jogging stroller . it offer nice feature where you lock front two wheels so they not swivel , which makes going over rough surfaces safer easier manage . this isn't kind stroller going hold everything but kitchen sink , if you looking kind stroller . there isn't cup snack tray your child . no clock . this just greatest stroller i'm so glad dump our awful graco stroller . hated . . thing . this snazzy , well designed , handy , lightweight , convenient , offers everything we need	1

i got this car seat my 10 month old daughter . i concerned it would too large my car ( i honda civic ) , but it fit just fine . rear-facing you would need put center back seat , so if you 2 kids , you would put seats up further , but if you short , likely not issue . i it installed fire station it fit perfectly -- he installed it minutes not need any foam pieces make it fit properly ! it perfect fit its own . pros : 1 . it best car seat you get ! 2 . side impact protection -- also makes good headrest when baby falls asleep3 . adjust knob harness awesome adjust especially over large coats4 . seat very well cushioned , soft fabric5 . fits fine small car even rear facing ( i civic)6 . it heavy so its not going anywhere ! 7 . works up 65 pounds , so we get lot use out seat8 . she loves it ! cons : 1 . it large/heavy ( though it staying my car so heavy not problem)2 . strap tighted harness little tough pull tight smaller child , but you need pull straight out not up3 . it expensivei highly recommend this seat ( we onyx fabric ) . it large , heavy expensive , but it best !! i buyer remorse few minutes , but i figured it best seat market right now $300 small price pay protecting my daughter . i lot research before buying felt confident my decision seat ! very pleased this seat ! also , please make sure you get your seat installed certified technician ( check your local children hospital ) . improperly installed car seats improper use car seats leading cause death among children infants . something very easy prevent	1
after 2 nights no sleep because our 18 months old son figured out how flip himself out pack play ( just sheer upper body strength ! )i so relieved find this crib tent it pain put together ( it took 20 minutes ) but well worth it because it works ... he stayed pack play didn't seem care all he " trapped " , i think kids like playfulness tent . my 4 year old jealous ! there few downsides ... its pain set up break down if your using pack play over nights travel it isn't portable could ... i older pack play , its ' 02 when we our first baby so ends higher than sides so clips no where clip onto but it hasn't mattered . side clips enough keep our strong toddler place . overall product expensive pain set up but priceless because it lets whole family sleep soundly safely !	1
great success . i love all kiddapotamus products , i bought so far because they well-done , thoughtful win awards all time - but best all , they really very handy . we went restaurant first time we could put our sons food right placemat table so he could feed himself . without mat , we hold onto food or but napkin underneath - so one us always busy our son instead enjoying dinner out . placemat comes scoop holds most food our son drop his mat floor still clean after we left . best all this mat we provide germfree space him sit , eat play - our table . he really happy it . after our visit we rolled this wonderful placemat together put it my handbag . i really satisfied	1
i got this product b/c when we first put our daughter highchair when we went out eat she immediately wanted touch table . i fine it until i wiped table off disgusted what i saw . tables most restaruants aren't always cleaned clean rags . now , she older eating some puffs other finger foods , it great b/c i put food directly her mat cup catches leftovers ! i keep ours large ziploc bag my diaper bag so when it dirty it doesn't get everything else dirty . it such simple concept product , but so great ! only complaint i sometimes it doesn't stick very well .....	1

i completely understand your concern . although , if you read instructions any mobile , when child old enough sit or stand crib ( around 6 months ) , you supposed take it off . they not built anyone play them . my son liked his mobile so much when he old enough reach it , we took it off my husband attached it top his hutch . this way we still able play song , but he couldn't reach it . i think this mobile perfect way add room theme . those who looking buy this mobile , or any other mobile : go store where you buying your crib , try it out . people babies us must thought i nuts , because i took quilt mobile set i wanted took them crib i buying . i able determine if mobile would fit before i bought it , i got see how colors bedding looked color crib . this eliminated lot hassle me later taking mobile back if it didn't fit	1
i purchased baby einstein discover play center keep office days my then-5-mnth-old son , toby , me work . he immediately loved musical buttons sun , ignored everything else . he grew , he discovered other toys one one . it exciting watch him perfecting different skills necessary manipulate activities . because i used baby einstein secure place meals , it needed regular cleaning . seat pops right off easy cleaning , but cloth saddle little hard unsnap base . overall , assembly pretty easy - i put it together myself i am not mechanically inclined . i definitely recommend baby einstein activity center . i looked several other brands turned off all obnoxious toys activities . i wanted something toby could learn , not just dazzled bells whistles . i can't say toby learned any spanish language buttons , but baby einstein kept my son engaged even 11 months , when his willingness stay one place usually short-lived .	1

ok so how many people think their baby exceptional ? well , pretty much everyone i know , they all right course . each baby exceptional , their own way . but how many babies rated exceptional pediatricians , nurses early childhood educators ? well , i know one - mine ! i faithfully used babyplus system when i pregnant . one time when using it , he started knocking back . yeap , i actually felt him knock back it , rhythm . it only happened once , but i told my husband i think this going one special kid . i 7 months pregnant then . well , lo behold , after he born people ( professionals ) don't stop telling us how amazing he . he most aware newborn you ever meet . he 2 months old now , sleeping through night ( 11 hours time ) since he 2 weeks . he cries when he needs something , never cries no reason ( but i make sure respond quickly his needs so i don't know how much it . ) . yesterday he started reaching objects . can't quite grab them yet , but it doesn't stop him trying . pediatrician nurse remarked how incredibly physically strong he , how aware he seems fact he vocalizes music unheard this age . he holding his head up since day he born ( 3 days late ) making eye contact since 2 weeks . so , i don't really know what if anything baby plus system it . i mean it could just accident but ... all i say i definitely use this product our future children . i would pay thousands if i ( we not rich people ) because its worth every penny	1

fan baby einstein line products , i put this my registry . what great gift it turned out . it could entertain my daughter when nothing else ! she now 16 months old too big it , but when she started watching baby einstein videos , she recognized characters this center	1
i 2 activity centers different makers ( other grandmas house)so i something compare this . i honestly say this this activity center worth extra 15-20 dollars you might spend . begin , seat swivels easily baby move one activity next . might not important issue older babies but my daughter 4 months old when she started use this compared other exersaucer , it really makes differnce seat she maneuver . toys attachments great quality offer variety skills baby learn entertained . i can't say enough positive things this activity center . i highly recommend it it both stimulating entertaining baby .	1
our little one loved this toy until he turned 8 months . now its really challenge try get him into this thing or baby einstein stationary entertainer ( see my review ) . however , he still play it standing outside loves touching legs toys chewing bar . unfortunately he puts up fight when we try get him it . but we good run this it worth it . he would bounce back forth say " ahhhhhhh !

i got this blanket accompany toddler set my daughter 3rd birthday . while toddler bedding set isn't highest quality world , this blanket ultra soft my daughter loves it	1
we've using this three weeks now don't single complaint ( yet ) . we love fact it plug-in too ! our little girl mesmerized mobile music almost hypnotizing ( surprisingly good quality ) . we don't use tray or restraints so we swaddle her before putting her down , she usually fast asleep within minutes . once she starts interacting toys , we'll use activity tray i'm sure she'll enjoy well . only downside swing motor make noise , but sound relatively minimal easily tuned out . i would rated it 5 stars , but color not optimal -- we're not huge fans pink , would rather chosen blue swing stars if it weren't $40 more	1
beautiful swing . my baby absolutely loves it !! there so many options choose like way she swings , lights , butterflies moving , songs played . i say she comfortable enough take naps it . very strong sturdy . swing deep enough where baby won't fall out . once again beautiful product i love my baby loves . thanks amazon !	1
i love this stroller ! first all , it comes fun , non-gender specific colors , unlike so many baby items . second , it extremely lightweight easy unfold one-handed ( even while holding baby ) . third , proportions stroller perfect ! my husband i test-drove many umbrella strollers found we usually kicked wheels ( he 6 feet tall , while i am 5'6 " ) , but we don't maclaren . also , handles tall enough he not hunched over pushing stroller . there lot other great features , too . there carry strap great transporting stroller . mesh seat keeps baby cool summer , we purchased " volo accessory pack " which solid , padded seat liner which we use winter keep baby warm . i recommend getting accessory pack , which also rain cover carry-bag stroller . basket under seat small side ( forget fitting diaper bag there ) but i don't mind carrying diaper bag because stroller so lightweight manuverable . my only other issue sun canopy not tilt very far forward . overall , we very satisfied maclaren volo	1
this stroller wonderful . i initially bought it strictly travel but love its ease use so much it used daily . pros : lightweight , great carrying strap , easily folds , takes up very little space your trunk , turquoise great unisex color . cons : once it folded you not lean it up against something without it falling . carrying strap this not big deal . this very minor issue not keep me recommending this stroller all my friends family .	1

this breat pump life saver . i used when i working par t-t ime even during full-time pump never failed me . its easy use , doesn't hurt all , not mention it very fast . i remember pumping 10 onces 10-12 minutes . clean up absolute breeze best part i could fit pump my little purse no one would ever know . my daughter used playtex bottles so i used liners playtex one step storage system attached it medela pump . this worked like charm didn't transfer milk one bottle . this pump worth every penny .	1

unlike other reviews , i find these bags easy use convenient . twist ties allow you pump right into bag which saves me wash bottles everytime i pump . other bags require you pump into bottle then pour it into bag which defeats whole purpose . medela bags also allow you get all air out which destroy great quality your milk if left inside . i store bags upright ( just case , although i've never leaky bag ) milk storage tray i bought babies us ( first years brand ) . once they frozen , i put them ziplock bags date written them easy retrieval when i need defrost milk . when i am ready defrost , i just stand them upright large bowl let cold water run 5 minutes , them pour into bottles . my baby never got hang breastfeeding , but i really wanted her breastmilk . she 2 1/2 months old now , i pumping milk since she 3 days old . i eventually chose bottlefeed exclusively , so i pump 5 times day . i use entire pack 50 bags less than week !!! i pump way more than she eats , so i lot stored milk . plently when i go back work can't pump often . take it someone who really knows . these bags not difficult use everyone else you believe . if they , i wouldn't use them considering how often i need use them .	1
we saw someone using these they appeared perfectly suited keeping young children nearby without carrying them or strapping them into strollers . kids parents all happy . so we ordered 6 : two us ( 2 grandchildren ) 1 each all parents other grandparents .	1

these great , we actually them couple different sizes so my son grow into them . ( note : we got him blue one , but they make you review them separately)here what i love : 1 . our house gets chilly night , even little space heater his room , i worried him cold no blankets ! sleep sack snuggly warm . 2 . our son moves constantly , awake or asleep . any blanket you use ( even if it safe ) would never stay him . sleep sacks never tangled or bunched up under him . 3 . this silly , but it just looks so darling . i love see him all ready bed , his pjs sleep sack . our son hated sleepers sacks bottom , i think they felt restrictive because he would kick kick them cry . he never minded sleep sack , maybe his pjs under it helps him feel more comfy . i recommend this , recommend getting couple each size so you throw one wash ready .	1
i started out various brands bottles when my baby born . my baby developed colic 5 weeks old . i wanted bottle prevented air bubbles least possible . avent bottles okay , but i tried dr. brown bottles . you see results immediately ! you see absolutely no air bubbles going into nipple or even bottle . no other bottle i've seen compares . result , my colicky baby less gas stomach pain . far extra time clean gadgets , oh please , no big deal ! it matter extra minute your day few bottles . it little strange 1st ( all gadgets ) , but no time it no big deal i promise ! i always highly recommend dr. brown bottles !	1
these great bottles ! i these some medela bottles came my breast pump . dr. browns wins -- no doubt it ! i guess i'm not meticulous some other reviewers cleaning sterilizing ... i just follow directions package sterlized when i started out then i've hand washed ever since . now , let face it , washing bottles pain regardless . washing few more parts no big deal . it takes me approx . 30 seconds more vent parts . it definitely worth effort . couple times i've used medela bottles i could visibly see bubbles coming through milk rising top . later my baby lots gas spit up . dr browns bottles never happens . i don't even use medelas backup " emergency " bottles anymore . i only use them hold water if i'm taking trip need bring some clean water home mix formula . dr browns bottles godsend	1

i love this stroller . i would recommend it anyone . my son high tone would arch really bad regular umbrella strollers , because it only buckled around his waist fabric not very sturdy . this one 5 point harness , heavy material keeps him arching . it also taller than most umbrella strollers so you not break your back pushing it . i absolutely love it .	1
i market nice umbrella stroller . i shopped around asked other moms what they like . this stroller very light pushes so easily ! so many expensive ones bad reviews .... reclining position plus well !	1

i used these bottles my first son would given them 3.5 stars . i would first tell you if they not fixed just right they would leak . after trying all others once again my daughter i decided use these . when i went buy new nipples i noticed they looked different . oh , wow , what diffrence . baby 4 months old no leaks . new nipples raised edge guarantees nipple tight collar . then there lip hugs rim bottle guard against leaks . really great thing you tighten these bottle your hearts content . i tightened it tight i could it didn't leak bit . new nipples words " extra soft " package if you look closely they look different around bottom . i am extremely satisfied these bottles now use them untill baby weaned .	1
these only bottles our daughter use . i really love them , but wish they weren't so wide it so hard get her hold them herself now she old enough try . i problem leaking occasionally when i've shaken bottle mix milk around .	1

[ ... ] i also found it easiest put it when first folding wrap half lengthwise , then spreading it out when secure . though it not easy nurse baby this carrier , it pretty easy take them out put them back once you used sling . if i it my way i would this ( long periods up , fussy babies , or those bad backs ) , sling ( newborns nursing ) , backpack ( only short trips , like laundry or carrying groceries up ) . if i pick one however this above all would it !! one more thing , it ok wear this warm weather , just dress accordingly ( you your baby ) . pocket plus well . oh , i find it easier , once , get baby out than back pack or front carrier . this also suitable right off bat new borns many stages there after	1
i never much luck traditional baby carriers . ones i tried uncomfortable wear hurt my back shoulders . it also never seemed like my daughter got truely comfortable . i love this wrap because it it versatility ( which something most carriers lack ) reasonably priced . soft , stretchy fabric , which great , provides even weight distribution makes my daughter feel safe secure . after watching dvd , using wrap very easy practical . my daughter especially likes front facing position , it really lets her explore world . i believe using wrap allowed us bond much more great new ways . after searching testing various products this best ! i highly recommend this product .	1
my daughter tried several bottles our granddaughters who both acid reflux . these greatest bottles only bottles helped them gas upset stomaches . they also great if you need add cereal their milk because acid reflux . wide bottles great this . you should only fill bottles up 8oz line you won't any problems bottles leaking . i would recommend these bottles anyone especially parents acid reflux babies .	1
i bought this wipe warmer my son right after he born because he hated diaper changes . so , i thought it coldness wipes upset him . my son now 4 months old , ever since we got it , we no problems quot ; fitsquot ; during diaper changes . not 1 ! it doesn't stay quot ; hotquot ; very long after you take it out warmer , but it still warm . i never problem it would reccommend it everyone ... especially mom boys .	1
i just received this warmer shower gift . i hesitant register it beginning because so many negative reviews . however , after trying it out , i've found it pretty decent product . it true wipes warm only couple seconds , but really , how long it take wipe baby off ? owners manual states warmer not meant produce hot wipes . i think it great something remove chill wipes , which should comforting baby . when i first used it , i didn't add water suggested manual , just see how it would work . wipes start dry out after awhile but then i added 1/2 cup water haven't noticed any more drying . all wipes still moist . i haven't noticed any discoloration either i am using huggies wipes . my baby hasn't arrived yet but i wanted try this out see myself how well it or not work . i think when he get here couple weeks , he thankful i used decently warm wipe instead cold one	1

my son big baby , checking over 9 pounds 22 inches , but headrests came carseat still didn't offer enough support . we fortunate received this product our baby shower . he looked so cozy fleece side cuddling him he very well supported . now it over 80 degrees , we've flipped it over use cooler fabric he still loves it . my son almost 8 weeks old , so we tried taking it out our carseat just using headrest came carseat . but , it still doesn't offer enough support . once he falls asleep , his little head just hung over side , so we put snuzzler back he much happier . it bit trickier get car seat straps safely adjusted around support , but after few days we hang it .	1
my baby loves this toy ! 4 months old i bring it us when we go out . he falls sleep quickly when i just set it front him rotate it around , he hears rattles it soothes him . fish beads it , cylinder thing spiral around it which facinates him little stars which make neat rattle . round sphere mirror it which swivels little ribbon pieces stick out making little more touch/feel interest flat piece holographic fish it swims when you move it . all all it his favorate toy . it good job when suctioned glass top table , but come off anything else . :) oh well ...	1

my son wearing halo sleep sack since day he came home hospital . winter baby it best thing world know he would warm not worry loose blankets . he began sleeping through night 7 weeks old . i think sleep sack gives him feeling security . he never able sleep without it . he now 30 months old still won't go sleep unless he his sleep sack . we friend ours who seamstress add additional material bottom because he became tall it . how much he loves his sleep sack . it far best thing i ever bought my son	1
these so awesome ! i never concern my son cold or get strangled blankets . one night i sleep sak laundry it cool night , so i put blanket over him - well my husband checked him middle night found blanket wrapped so tightly around his neck he could hardly believe our son still breathing . very scary . so if anything , make sure you more than one sleep sak .	1
i bought this pump lactation consultant our child pediatrician office . after i went back work , it proved excellent purchase . i able pump discreetly work cool my milk attached cooler . if we took trip , i could take pump pump car using battery attachment or even our hotel room . one time pump not suctioning properly . when i called medela , they so helpful . they assistemd me while i phone get it working properly . it still didn't work so they offered me new pump exchange my old one . andreaetta [ ...	1
i read other reviews find some differing opinions . i loved this pump because it very effective my needs . i used it everyday work 6 months . it took 20 minutes express milk i bags go pump accurately measure milk . also , i able use one arm hand hold cups place while i made phone calls other . i can't imagine pump more effective	1
you ever tried get your infant into jacket , snowsuit or thick blanket then into carseat straps ? not so easy huh ? well this fabulous product saved me headache - although i tried just see if it really difficult ! i love i put my now 9 month old into carseat bundle me zip her up ! thats it ! front covers her face if it windy she warm cozy inside ! especially cold days or when she dressed cute rather than cold i put extra blanket her inside bundle me she cant throw it off ! i lite version which i used all spring summer ( air conditioned car ) now this one fall winter ! some commented how easy it move baby bundle me carseat stroller - i disagree i would just get second one stroller . velcro back holds it into carset wake up sleeping baby if you try remove whole thing baby inside . great product	1
this urban bundle me one best baby items i've bought my son ! it much more convenient than struggling keep blanket car seat . if baby gets too warm just unzip cover off ! i like this version much better than original bundle me , which seems like it would get too warm my baby . material urban bundle me warm enough rainy washington weather but not too warm like fleece original bundle me . i also love little pocket where i store emergency pacifier or other small items . it washes great i plan buy larger toddler size once my son outgrows this . one minor problem zipper occasionally gets stuck , but that expected when zipper isn't zipped straight line . =)	1
we used avent our first son almost 5 years ago . i run into some leaking problems came white cap screwing onto bottle . i found if i tightened bottle bit more it eliminated leaks completely . after figuring this out , we no more problems . we expecting our second child few months i started buy avent again . our first son not whole lot gas problems . course he gassy times , so i can't say he no gas , but he didn't appear so much gas where it bothering him . i really liked wide bottle avent . it made it more comfortable me hold then later when our son got old enough wide bottle made it easy him hold . avent also handles attach bottles when your baby/toddler gets old enough hold bottle themselves . handles wide colorful made holding easy little hands . nipples i feel first bit hard , but our son never any problems taking it . course , this vary amoung babies . after just purchasing 3 pack 4 oz bottles impending baby #2 i opened up package after seeing advertisement " extra soft nipple " it indeed softer then it 5 years ago . if you looking save money , i suggest either buying very few 4oz bottles or simply buying 9 oz or even 11 oz bottles instead they outgrow 4 oz very quickly . we no problems cleaning these bottle well they held up very well . we never replace them .	1
we love handle this car seat . i owned graco snug ride hated it --- it not snap into supermarket shopping cart . handle triangle shape you carry it forward , backward , or against your hip . love it , bought one my second child again my last child when first one expired	1
pros : great music , high/low volume choice , light show ceiling plus , my daughter loves listen/watch it every night she falls asleep ! cons : strap broke after 2 moves ( but if you contact baby einstein co . they send you new one free charge ) , wish it just on/off ( switch button 1 song play vs . all songs play)all all , i like this because it works my daughter .	1
i love dr . brown bottles . bigger ones closer breast so its easy switch back forth . i like comfort grip also	1
hi , i no idea if these bottles help colic/gasey baby . my baby never like . i considered these bottles because i hated my son suck till he could suck no more then let go nipple so air could back into regualar bottle . so i started looking bottle didn't nipple collaspe . first we tried playtex . they worked but extremely hard mix powdered formula because liners held exactly 8 oz ( also expensive liners ) . then i switched avent , thought it my dream come true bottle . until they started leaking no matter how i screwed ring . i finally figured out problem , skirts nipples warp after very little use . so i ended up constantly buying new nipples never knowing when we would get whole bottle dumped us . so then dr brown came out these wide neck bottles . after some reading directions trial error ; this it : bottle us !! this how we it ; you can't use valve while mixing formula or warming or bottle leak . so water goes bottle just ring , nipple cap get screwed . valve goes zip-lock bag . ten minuetes before bottle needed . i but formula bottle shake . ten minuets all bubbles down i incert valve feed . no leaks . i aunt who premixes her formuala two days worth bottles puts them fridge ( once again leaving valves out ) . then she gets them out , swirls little , takes off top , microwaves 30 secs , incerts valve , checks tempreture feeds . no leaks either . only time i ever leak when i mixed or heated formula valves which directions say not . like i said this what works best us	1
i found this sheet work very well my pack play pad . it just slips over bottom it stays very well . i don't know other play pens , but this great product use pack ' play	1
this great tub any baby able sit up their own . it perfect size room your little one grow . it not only saves water you would use fill larger tub but gives your little one sense security . when i tried our baby big tub he cried didnt like it so i tried him back his infant tub he fine . i realized it matter security him . large tub just so over-whelming . he loves squeek duck play tossing rings . price just right ! just careful when you inflate tub because it inflates sections . my husband used air compressor thinking it all one compartment fill air it blew up	1

we switch this warmer very disappointed first year night day warmer . this one least not burn our hands when taking out bottle . water inside not come boiling point . it still overheat bottle if you leave bottle too long . light not seem helpful . it keeps temperate too high level . however compare first year one , you not precisely accurate water level ( which pain when you use first year one 3am your sleepy eyes ) you not get mess water around table , so i'd recommend this product . also , warmer kind make ' tick ' noise when it so it becomes reminder warmer still , which good thing	1
we bought one these quilted sacks ( fleece one cotton one ) when our daughter born winter . it felt like we goldilocks .... fleece kept our baby too warm , cotton kept her too cold , but quilted sack just right . reviewer said , fabric big " clingy " , however , it just slight annoyance benefits far outweigh irritation . ( besides , i found fleece ones extremely static-y cotton sacks wrinkle into little ball dryer . )	1
this neat little spout cover . hat duck lifts so you pour bubble bath into it , so it slowly drizzles make alot bubbles . would recommend	1

if you baby , you pretty much one these or least something very similar . bjorn original i think key their popularity simplicity design . lot other brands added things ( e.g. pockets , extra buckles or straps , multiple carrying positions , etc . ) try differentiate . bjorn kept it simple . both my partner i use same one ( easily adjusts different size people ) pretty much everywhere including sweeping mopping floors . boy loves facing forward where he see everything . hope this isn't edited : look around cheaper prices . they release new patterns every year many places discount previous years patterns	1
i received this baby bjorn gift before my first child born february 2004 . i used it her up through 9 months age . then when we our second child , i pulled it out it best thing . she loves it it saved me put her down when i am chasing my first child who now 2 year old . i recommend any new mom one it such great quality it lasts long long time , it worth money . if we decide child i definitely pulling it out again . mom 2 little girls	1

i don't know reason bad reviews , this fits pp mattress very snugly , held up well 3 years now ; i just took them out wash our new baby they're still great shape , just tiny bit pilling fabric . no , they're not waterproof , so get pad underneath it .	1
i purchased this sheet two years ago my son graco pack ' play . no , it isn't waterproof- but i never come across sheet . however , i recommend purchasing bru especially baby brand waterproof pad go underneath it ( just like you would real mattress ! ) . when placed over pad , sheet lies flat , instantly your pnp mattress protected ! this only sheet i would recommend use graco pack ' play because it made just this ! port-a-crib sheets different , don't lie flat or fit snug- therefore , i don't feel they safe . this sheet easy launder not shrink- it fit every time ! i liked this sheet so much i'd buy it again- i ! i am expecting twins , so i purchased second one my second pnp !	1

i never written review before , but after 4 months using flash ex stroller i encourage more users ! i tried others ' car seat strollers they not nearly light easy this one . i love it folds thirds , because you travel it your car it fits into overhead compartment airplane , which means it won't suffer insults baggage handling . i use it safe seat , which fits wonderfully without any adjustments ( just use seatbelt ! ) . only downside underside basket small , but i think small portability ease use ( including carrier strap ) makes it very worthwhile . my favorite baby purchase so far	1
i love this stroller ! its lightweight durable . my son also enjoys this stroller ( i think it because he see mommy ! ) i would highly recommend this stroller ! :	1
i tried 3 other mattress pads , none them held up more than couple washings shrinking ripping . this pad actually fits mattress ! finally ! well worth money . not waterproof , but since crib mattress , i didn't need waterproof mattress pad . great quality , worry free product delivers promised !	1

i bought blue one my baby so i could see change her diapers middle night without turning bright lights . i keep it my nightstand carry budy her crib . it safe set it down crib next her . it comes automatically when you pick it up its base shuts off again when you set it back down base . base magnetic , so don't keep it close any electonics like tvs or computers . i love it so much i bought orange one my stepson room . orange one glows red when light . then i bought three more gifts various friends family young children . today , i went ahead bought green one myself . they stay lit 10 hours so it great all power outages we get here winter . i also use it get ready bed or find things my room night while my husband sleeping since he gets up go work much earlier than me . it bright enough help me find my way around dark but not bright enough wake him or baby . it also great guest night light . it very soft glow doesn't hurt your eyes when you need get up middle night .	1
i love this mobile so much i ended up buying one my 3 month old niece . they love it too !! this one best mobiles because movements colors well fact you still little night light music box when you detatch mobile part . not mention it plays music close 20 minutes . my 13 month old loves it ( so my 4 year old ) . he just mesmerized it when he tired amused it when he wakes up turns it after he sleeping . i little reluctant this mobile when i read some reviews it too quiet . i wanted set record straight . mobile quiet ... but it baby you trying lull them sleep so how loud you want it ? i think volume perfect but if you prefer make it louder or house loud you switch it louder volume but we always keep it softest it just fine . i highly recommend this mobile	1
i compared reviews this mobile tinylove mobile called symphony motion fisher price ocean wonders mobile . i really like fact symphony motion award winning but biggest drawback one fact it actually keep babies awake because how active it . i like ocean wonders mobile because ceiling projection but drawback there people said you pretty much room pitch black dark see those images well . since we keep night light our little one , we decided against one too . end , we chose fisher price rainforest mobile because it seemed most soothing we not disappointed . she tries hard stay awake watch leaves go colorful animals go round round . but there something slow speed rotation jungle noise and/or classical music just makes her drowsy everytime . my husband i very pleased this purchase	1
good size . easy setup . colorful design . no frills	1
if we would known this available earlier , we wouldn't bought smaller play-yard we replaced this . our son , who 21 months 90 percentile height weight , just loves this play-yard we love fact he safer more comfortable than ever before . we very pleased quality , size , portability , color scheme . this far best money we spent child related item . we highly recommend this item we confident you pleased it just we .	1
we live small military base overseas . my first stroller got all moldy storage , so we purchased this one when new baby came . my 3 year old loves stroller , he calls it his spaceship , or his horse depending day his mood . he hasn't sat stroller since he learned how walk , but he ride this all day long . my newborn loves stroller much any newborn loves something . it handels very well , even uneven cobblestone walkways . everyone base comments how cool stroller , several friends babies way considering purchasing one their own . we love it sort glad our old one got moldy , so we could get new one . : -	1
i received these friend detroit , mi when my son only baby . he now 16 months old these table toppers become indespensible . mcdonalds , fish camp , back yard burgers , even finest restaurants . they stick very well even if he pulls them , they stuck . good thing they not pull off finish ! he loves ones blues clues we go over characters fruits printed them while we waiting our food . keep couple snack size zippy bag put them diaper bag . full bag just too big . yourself your little one favor get bunch these . makes this mommy feel much better not getting germy	1
i going keep receiver our office which lot computer equipment . we bought 900 mhz monitor because most our equipment runs 2.4 ghz . we hoping there would less interference . we surprised very pleased how well this monitor worked . receiver produces faint hum , but overall , reception clear . every now then , i hear clicking sound over receiver , but i'm not sure if it monitor or hot air humidifier i keep baby room . we definitely pleased this purchase	1
this one toy i brought amazon not problem . my son loves it price right	1
friend lent me hers i thought ' what am i going use this since i intended baby his crib right away . ' well , i c-section getting out bed twenty times night not feasible , nor comfortable . any woman who c-section really needs this item	1
this great sleeper , but unfortunately it too small our 2.5 month old son almost overgrown it . he loves sleep it feels everywhere home if he sleep his little bed . if there " extending " option we would very very happy , but way it we only use it couple weeks	1
my 2 yr old son not interested potty training until this . we bought this potty chair it instantly got his attention . he went not going potty going potty all time . i bought one my sister- -law who 2 boys she trying potty train couldn't keep them interested only big mess within 2 weeks this totally got her boys track . so i would absolutly reccomend this anyone troubles or struggling potty training little boys , combo this peter potty unbeatable quick getting task . when we started my son this , within week 1/2 he boxers going all day night no troubles . you really appreciate this !! good luck !	1
this my first review-only because i disagree all negative reviews this this potty chair so wonderful . this potty easy clean very easy little ones use all themselves . my son 3 4 months(and he big his age ) this potty not too little him . he loves music it not distracting him or too much fun . i however not use splash guard i didn't see need so i dont know if it falls off easily or not . we tried everything potty train him this chair letting him go without pants or diapers or making sure his training pants easy him pull up down only thing worked . he gets use it himself he even dumps it into real toilet afterwards he gets very excited it	1
i admit i shocked read all negative reviews this stroller . i loved it day my daughter born , almost 2 years ago , am now using it my son . it very lightweight easy steer . i never problem maneuvering it through mall or stores , even tightest spaces . my daughter loves she sit forward see world around her , i love she buckled into 5 point harness same time !!! after 2 years pretty constant use tossed into pulled out my car trunk my husband truck , stroller still looks brand new . fabric easy clean very durable . i understand remarks cup holder basket small side . if these particular features your " most important " list , i might think buying full-sized stroller or travel system , not one italian brands . europeans just don't understand our fascination gallon-sized cup holders enormous storage baskets ... just look their cars you'll understand . however , if you're looking stroller function well both your everyday standard stroller your travel lightweight stroller , go aria .	1
my daughter really enjoyed this mat . beginning she would just sort check out fish(she looooves fish ) , but over time her ability interact it greatly increased . now-4mnths- she pushes around fish great joy even making fun bubbles . it great first tummy time toy . pillow velcros so you remove it if your little one wants practice holding themselves up or just wash . far new water everyday thing goes . i good beginning believing it might turn green or fog up or something . it turns out nothing horrible happen if you don't change it very often . actually ability empty it helpful if you plan taking it say grandma house . very easy roll up take unlike our playmat . little sun could easier activate bubble noise . little hard little bitty ones . toys still good crinkling chewing though .	1
$35 or so , this good value . rails sturdy enough keep kid rolling out bed , even if it not set up exactly right . length adjusts easily . it hard keep straps fastened correctly underneath mattress , though , especially if it heavy mattress . they supposedly fold down sides , too , but i still haven't able get mechanism work	1
i highly recommend this gate actually purchased 3 them , 2 online 1 store . very versatile different width sections which added . really like extra height they used puppy who really jump !! also like ability swing gate either direction	1
i'm surprised see so many negative reviews . we wore this sling both babies , even when they toddlers wanted carried ( try snuggli ! ) i always kept one hand newborn ( i wanted , anyway ) , but daddy didn't . they grew , sling accommodated different positions tug strap : front facing , side hip , my back so i could work kitchen . fit easily over any layers . best feature : we could transfer sleeping baby ( or toddler ) one caregiver , or lay sleeping child down nap , without jiggling wee one out carrier or wrestling readjusting multiple carrier straps fit different sized people . our babysitters friends wore this sling , too	1
i bought nojo sling before my daughter born feb 2002 looking forward using it breastfeeding getting around without hassel stroller or carseat . it best friend i needed new mother . life so much easier it still . my daughter two i use this sling still she grown so much more since then . thanks nojo making life me my husband so easy fun . malls grocery stores never same . plus mopping our home made easier because she just holds watches safe out way her sling , which also like her blankie . thank you , jennifer celeste miami , florida	1
i safety 1st walker similar ( winnie pooh ) my girl loves it . fact , she doesn't want her hop pop much because she scoots around her walker . i got my walker kmart ( you change batteries hunny pot ) . i wasn't going get her walker all just use her hop pop but she seems really like it .	1
i bought this safe padded sheet my four month baby , it perfecto safe sheet breathe . good quality , nice price	1
soft , easy attach , absorbs well , don't lift mattress change , still see cute sheet side crib	1
i only wish crayons thicker so they wouldn't break so quickly ! i purchased this my 20 month old she absolutely loves this . she comes shower when i'm it saying " color " tries get just color it wall ! i put her shower let her color while i shower , then get out , let her continue color while i'm getting dried off then bathe her . she actually hates getting out bathtub now!i'd recommend this anyone children who love draw or color . crayon marks easily removed off any tile or ceramic tub ( though i don't know how well it would work those plastic/laminate ones ) side compartments hold crayons holes so crayons dry , there no crayons lying all over bathtub . most used christmas gift yet ( even loved my 9 year old son ! )	1
3 yr old fighting each night take bath , now asks take bath . great toy . adult needed open crayon compartments ( i hard time -- nothing grasp ) , but she learned hold them open keep closing . crayon suprisingly dark , yet easy rub off . she cleans surface herself wash cloth	1
i bought this my 2 month old christmas . my baby loves it . my baby sit it hours	1
my son daughter-in-law report all baby bottles they've tried , dr. brown natural flow bottles easiest use , my grandson much easier time any possible after-effects bottle feeding times	1

i love it ! my son sit table us take nap . he only 2 months old . it looks great our family years come . easy set up i love fact it trasition into toddler seat	1
we bought this because our son quickly outgrowing his car seat big snow suits coats made it much tighter , so using this we didn't put them him . fit very good our graco car set , kept baby warm it lot easier just zip this down when you get somewhere rather than take coats off . i stashing this away use if i baby , wish i bought it sooner .	1
this most comfortable carrier i tried , easiest put . shoulder-cupping theory works well practice , least my son who 7.5 kilos right now . carrier itself well made clasps nice instead tie it . i would say mobility tad limited because if you reach anything high up shoulder strap slips up around my neck , but otherwise i able stuff around house while wearing my son , we both comfortable	1
i used this pillow since beginning my pregnancy it wonderful . no problems stuffing becoming lumpy or mis-shapen . great releaving hip pain stomach sleeper , it allows you sleep your side similar comfort stomach sleeping leaning into pillow . i highly recommend it	1

my 4 month old son absolutely loves this . we got it him when he 2 months old this lifesaver us since then . he plays it over hour time which gives me time other stuff around house	1
i love it i love it i love it ! my son three half months old quickly becomes bored needs new stimulus . this playmat just trick , i'm heaven . when he tires staring wide array toys attached playard playing them he rolls over pushes aqua part mat(his favorite part ) then he rolls back over stares lights dancing fish detachable music box happily laughs kicks cloth poles hold soft child safe friendly toys above his head , he loves able control movements toys above his head so much ... cloth covered poles not scare me muc typical plastic ones , lastly he looks himself mirror he drifts off sleep . he loves this mat finally given me some free time . tummy time doubled voluntarily since we recieved it mail . defenitely worth higher price ! also biggest playmat this type i've found market defenitely last me until far after we hit crawling stage then detachable toys still usable . mat naptime . thank you	1

i purchased this stroller few weeks ago . i 22 month old 4 year old they love it ... my 4 year old loves fact if she gets tired she sit or stand back . we going ny couple weeks this why i purchased this stroller because you walk everywhere , now i am sure they ok . reason why i only gave it 4 stars because it little heavier than i expected . other than i great ! i higly recommend it . i plan child so i know i keep this while !	1

grandmother i find this easy quick warm bottles or baby food jars . heats very little time easy adjust temperature adding or removing water . wish i this when my kids little	1
this great product ! i bought 3 additional ones baby showers after i used first one myself . it quick easy . although you guess how much water put warmer , but you get used it pretty quickly . i can't live without it recommend it everyone	1
these place mats greatest , you children want feed their selves but also you can't give them plate their own without them dropping them making mess . mats work great because tables not always clean you would like you just gather up all your mess end meal throw it away	1
i'm mechanical engineer after reading other reviews , i thought i'd pull out my tools make this thing work our peg perego p3 stroller . fact , it went quite easily . key locate clamps just below p3 logo brace goes down toward rear wheels . this allows stroller folded up without removing clamp - even if you large accessories like snack tray or cup holder attached . i slightly angle cup holder out when seat reclined all way back ( because we snap car seat currently our infant ) . i could not attach clamps anywhere else stroller though due large oval tubing necessity folding it up . i'm impressed quality unit though . sure use long bolts since oval-shaped tubing makes it little difficult connect two halves clamp . it would even better if " clickngo " included bolts 1/4 " longer so you wouldn't strain pull halves together .	1
bought this set black our maclaren ryder stroller great success . you need test positions before you tighten clamps make sure they won't interfere closing stroller . we placed one clamp side so our daughter could access either her sippy cup or snack tray depending which we attached time , other clamp one stroller handles so we could attach cup holder or water bottle holder our use . we spent few days disney world no problems attachments falling off or knocking into things . you need remember remove store attachments before folding stroller so they don't get knocked off lost . we haven't used s-hooks yet , they feel look little flimsy , but they'd probably okay light bags	1
this sterilizer wonderful ! first time mother , i'm still figuring out things . but i realized this one those things i truly need . it so easy use save lot time . i am not germ freak , but i like know bottles i am traveling clean sterile . my baby almost 6 months old i used it dr. brown bottles , medela breast pump parts , any other baby parts would fit into it .	1

i love this item . i not any trouble it so far . my infant set fits right . if baby sleeping we go game , i place car seat right cabana	1
i've owned this stroller more than two years used it almost every day , typically strolling two miles per day , often lots groceries storage basket . my toddler also takes her naps graco ( won't nap anywhere else ) . one little piece just broke it not safety issue but i'm taking opportunity shop smaller stroller . reading reviews other strollers , including pricey ones , made me appreciate graco even more . i wish it little more narrow maneuver through tight store aisles , take up less room my house , but i no other complaints . here list pros cons ... pros : - rides very , very well . durable up down curbs . - large storage area accommodates up three bags groceries . - toddler comfortable naps stroller . - reclines easily folds pretty easily . - two cup holders back one front tray which clicks off one side remove child more easily . - window back view child through shade . - adjustable handle good tall people ( i'm 5'10 " push it comfortably ) . - works graco car seat newbornscons : - quite wide . sometimes hard fit through aisles small neighborhood stores takes up lot space home car trunk . - doesn't accommodate newborns without car seat . - shade doesn't fully shield child until he/she quite tall . until one year age , i draped light blanket over shade when necessary .	1
i used this my daughter . only time it leaked when it wasn't snapped right . we never used music ( thinking it wouldn't beneficial she'd want put toys it make music go ) . it lot easier clean our other potty chair . there little ' trick ' ( if you call it ) unsnap it before pulling it out instead just pulling it all way once . lightweight but sturdy . it back which feels more like real potty . she no problems sitting it . obviously , we never used pee guard ( which easily removable )	1
i bought this play gym our daughter when she 5 months old . she loves it , plays it happily long periods time , little musical lion toy actually musical ( not all annoying ! ) plays several different catchy tunes . toys moved around swapped out different , separate toys , more links added move things closer her . we very happy this purchase , so she	1
my son 3 half we started potty training two months before he turned 3 . we purchased cheaper seats target walmart , but he would still #2 accidents . our toilet very elongated all other seats didn't fit well very wobbly . we just recently bought baby bjorn toilet trainer now he excited going #2 .... it very secure because adjusting dial he get potty all himself . no more accidents after week this seat ! high front prevents #1 spillage contor shape holds him well . i wish i known this seat 8 months ago . i very highly reccomend this seat	1

my 6 month old son enjoys this saucer lot . i just wish it more height adjustments - even highest setting 6 months 27 inches tall seems not high enough - my son put his whole foot ground - instructions say babies should only able reach bottom their toes . overall though , great product	1
my son , he picture above , received this christmas gift his aunt , picked out me because it just everything you need toy like this . music sounds not annoying parents , least not me my five month old , jacob loves it . he content there least hour , which gives me sometime get some things . he laughs when frog croaks when bee buzzes he actually hums when music plays . it learning mode raised toy bar or music mode which great younger babies like mine . i highly reccommend this item . even though my son big playmat part i still use mat put floor when he playing	1

i really love this wipes warmer ! my baby used cry when we changed his diaper night but now we use warm wipes he hardly notices it he not fully wake up . i definetly recommend it other friends . only drawback i could not buy it mexico so i ask friend it	1
i can't believe there so much controversy bottle warmers wipe warmers ! if you choose get one , this wipe warmer great ! heating element top , which makes it safer than other models . this also ensures next wipe ( one top ) warmest ... makes sense ! i haven't used night light yet , but i may future . besides , this model doesn't cost any more than one without night light . when we out , obviously my baby gets treated cold wipes , but home we always change her her nursery warm ones . i am glad this " luxury " my baby . i am pleased i avoid cold wipes especially middle night or after particuarly bad bm . it nice able provide little extra comfort . i use pampers sensitive pop-up wipes , sometimes two pop out instead one , but it really no problem ... how many times you use just one wipe anyway ? i've no issue dry wipes because i read directions . i just add water whenever i add wipes ; it no-brainer ! if i'm going out , not using wipes home all day , i unplug warmer -- according directions . i keep my warmer changing pad , i always very warm , moist wipes tend my baby ... just like gentle wash-cloth	1
i received this play gym shower gift prior my childs birth . i also received larger more elaborate play gym same time . because this gym smaller more portable i started placing my munchkin it 3 weeks stimulate entertain her . bold black white designs primary colors perfect newborn attempt focus there aren't ton hanging toys overstimulate or startle her . it folds up easily carrying around house or packing car trip grammie . you even throw few extra toys when folded ( it like large purse or carrying bag ) know they won't fall out way . now baby close 2 months old more playful hanging toys just right height her bat she loves gaze herself coo into mirror . overall i'm pleased gym would reccomend it . i only gave it 4 stars because times overhead bar tilt this way or you straighten it bit keep it upright	1
we discovered my son liked swing when he would fall asleep gym nursery thier swings . i chose this one because we already baby einstein pack-n-play timer feature which works perfectly way . my 9 week old son goes right sleep . simply wonderful	1

when i first bought this my son he around 4-5 months old . i disappointed first because he not like it . he would sceam when i put him it . i thought , wasted money . every week i started put him it more , he finally figured out around 6 months how jump it . now it his favorite activity . he jumps himself silly , loves play all toys . he spends most time trying get parrot top . highly recommend . just give them time adjust big enough use it .	1
we actually buy couple extra bases each our cars sitters too .	1
i loved my diaper genie . i used it 2 years without problem . my teenage daughter even figured it out . it kept smell contained pretty well . we would empty it every 5 days never problem . well worth investment	1
us this life saver !!... it really helpfull ... i even bought one my mother house ... im agree lot nice stuff other reviews im not going repeat them , but i say something how many times it gets full . it not true it gets full everyday .... or .... it would get full if you put diapers open .... what you fold diaper together wipes you use , you would see difference ... i use change it every 2 days , now it gets full every 4 days .... refills not expensive all , you could always get free refills babies us , buying 2 or 3 together .... i use one refill every 3 weeks or so .... i haven't try any other one market , but me this perfect , so i could say best option !!	1

if i could give this product 10 stars , i would . my son loves snuggled up his swaddle me . he sleeps better doesnt startle easily . he hard time staying awake when he it , so if your baby doesnt stay awake feedings , you may want wait until after he full swaddle him . i wish i purchased least 2 . i plan buy one , well 2 large sized ones . so far i tried small microfleece . my son born 7 lbs still using small one ( its rather large him ) 3 weeks later ( not sure how much he weighs now , but 0-3 month sized clothes still too big him ) . future , any woman i ever buy baby gift getting 1 or 2 these me . you cannot baby without one ! make sure you get 2 or 3 because you miserable when your only swaddle me wash , or if you leave it somewhere , like i just :	1

let me start saying i twins 2.5 . i never written review before i wanted so this item . i reluctant purchase cooshie due cost purchased hard plastic ones wal-mart instead . hard plastic ones leaving small bruises my girls ' backs right their spine leaning back into hard seat . they also rub finish off seats your hard wood chairs without putting something under them . also hard plastic ones hard clean difficult remove seats clean under them , because crumbs get under it it around it . cooshie light enough my girls carry it around them selves they love sit them watch tv . i love ease able move seats without unstrapping them case we need extra adult space . mine came carry bags so we take them us restaurant not use germ infested seats there . cooshie seats well worth money . i plan use ours several years come . they also breeze clean	1
i smaller five year old wanted sit big boy chair , not stool we using . after he destroyed one our phone books , scratched our wood chairs hard plastic seat , i found cooshie . i highly recommend it . it easy cart you he loves seat move around . we looking forward using it next week movie theater . no more coats ! consider this seat if your child smaller , but no longer toddler . addition , he loved color softness . what bonus	1
i love carseat , my baby small she so cozy it . this my third child i wish i this carseat first . i not tell you how many compliments i get it when i go out too ! it so pretty	1
i purchased this stroller walking around neighborhood so weight/size/fold not issue . tires suspension give smooth ride it easy steer . negatives : seat padding could thicker , recline mechanism cheap toggle , i laughed when i read others ' complaints getting their finger caught harness but it happened my husband myself . price , it great value i would definitely recommend it	1
this tent much needed item after my son 18m climbed out his crib but then not emotionally ready his daybed yet . since i needed it asap i could not wait shipping so i called local stores . it wasn't few baby stores , which surprised me but i found it babies us . i wanted original one without side enclosures but could not find it . i guess there good reason they changed design i trust it wise consumers input . anyway , setting up tent part snap but affixing it our crib challenge . we convertbable 4 1 crib headboard higher than drop rail side . this means front back vertical poles aren't even which causes problem when trying secure super strong velcro fasteners . it would leave it crooked possibly able slide since corners would not resting stable must . we found way level it , since i not gonna give up . my hubby mounted old broomstck behind backboard even front we got it level , well rested snug crib perimeter . my complaint taking time effort based good safety so i say it preparation not disway your purchasing . velcro hoops so tough pry open then fasten it worked me out . also , when inserting mattress we found it much easier if two people it so they get it flat then drop it into net rather than trying sinch down sides . enclosure soo snug it make it hard adjust if you drop one side down first . all say , my son loves it so eager get back into his crib lastnight . i peace knowing he wont fall trying climb out again	1
we very pleased this item . others mentioned , changing sheets requires removing entire tent , but i didn't mind doing this . our son thought it neat- just like camping inside . he not even attempt jump out his crib after this put . it fit just fine our sleigh crib	1
this perfect chair . we love it . my son 6 months he seems really confortable it . i'm sure he'll fine next few years . it very convenient all its different positions . i feed him living room or kitchen table . he vertical eat solids , little less drink his bottle laying back if he falls asleep . it very easy clean well , easy fold . it just perfect . nothing wrong it .	1
i seriously love this bowl spoon . bowl fits nicely your hand so it easy feed squirming baby . spoon very soft tip so you don't worry hurting their gums . my daughter year old mostly feeds herself , but we still using bowl snacks or i'll put yogurt one side fruit other . lid always stays bowl still looks new even though we've used them lot . i would highly recommend this product	1
my son used this until he refused sit basket anymore . i just washed it every so often kept it my car next time . maks them more comfy keeps them warmer winter	1
this amazing product . i seen other shopping cart covers stores but they all little ties velcro sides look quite complicated . who time all ? floppy seat you just stretch it over cart , slide seat belt through , buckle go . it covers all surfaces cart , unlike some others . it so nice comfy , lots cushion i attach toy loops put my baby sun hat pocket . wonderful , wonderful , wonderful . i know it more expensive than some covers stores but it well worth extra cost . this one best baby products we purchased	1
first time mom i am very nervous my son getting germs . he likes lick everything . i got this product it fit nicely every cart i ecountered except costco cart . cart too big . i still able cover seat handle preventing aj " tasting cart " . i also like fact it easily washable its own safety strap . minor problem i can't seem fold it up without carefully thinking it . otherwise it stays my trunk out way unitl i need it	1
my mom bought this me , thinking it would help my back discomfort . well , i rolled my eyes idea i found relief ! i able up no lower back discomfort . it very discreet i am not constantly walking around holding my back or belly . belly sling , we call it , great i would definitly recomend this product	1
right moment it arrive my daughter loves it . she sleeps perfectly dora stuffed sleep her nightnight time	1
this potty seat fits toilet not slip around . child secure comfortable , rather than doing balancing act . this goes long way child trying his best learn . also , its easy clean .	1
when i registered my baby shower , i inadvertently registered regular ventaire bottles well natural shape bottles ( which what i wanting ) , so my review discuss both types . natural shape ventairefor starters , natural shape bottles good babies who breastfeeding , because milk doesn't flow out when bottle tipped over . baby really suck get it out , it open its mouth wider due size nipple . feeding my son stage 1 nipple took really long time . approximately 40-45 minutes . however , i tried stage 2 nipple when he four months old , milk flowed out pretty easily . so quickly fact he got really mad refused eat because he getting choked . i switched back stage 1 nipples , also began relying heavily regular ventaire bottles . he now 5 months old we switched stage 2 nipples natural shape bottles , he doing well . he tends finish 6-7 oz bottle 10 minutes . these bottles lot wider than regular bottles , he harder time trying grasp hold these bottles . regular ventaire now regular ventaire bottles . i found these bottles better two us . although i initially breastfed , chose natural shape bottles reason , i quit breastfeeding four weeks . so issue nipple wouldn't confuse baby no longer concern us . regular ventaire bottles no flow issues , even stage 1 nipples . he finished his bottle faster this type bottle seemed no problems speed flow . we switched stage 2 nipples couple weeks ago transition smooth . i didn't notice him getting choked , he doesn't gulp quickly he stage 2 nipples natural shape bottles . these bottles also slimmer , which makes it easier him try grasp hold bottle . now operation both types bottles . they plastic disc fits into bottom ring bottle , then bottle screws , finally nipple its ring screw top . regular ventaire bottles disc fits snugly into bottom . natural shape bottles , it fit into little notch , it easy think it right only find out its not ( ie , when milk starts leaking out ) . we heat our bottles pan water stove , bottom rings tendency hold water . so if you use this method , you need tap bottle sideways pan shake out water ring , i usually hold dish towel up edge ring well tip bottle so all hot water comes out . if you don't , when you tip bottle feed your baby hot water run down onto your hand ( or baby hand if s/he hold bottle ) . this isn't really reason not buy bottles , just something aware . finally , some people wondered if babies swallow less air this type bottle . i two older children i used standard bottles , i seen no difference those these playtex bottles . my son still burps just much next baby . occasionally during feeding you hear some air leaking out , but overall , i really don't think it makes any difference	1
this good quality gate which not too difficult install . we use it 2 cats , so we don't lock unlock gate pass through it , since cats can't push gate open . i liked pressure gauge included unit . very sturdy , very solid . it well worth cost	1
five young children our home , we two these baby bjorn potties . constant use ( abuse ) they still look brand new ! they easy clean ( i even stuck bowl portion dishwasher ) easy transport . my kids love bright colors which make potty training easier :) well worth money !	1
we bought 2 these potty chairs . they so easy clean stayed brand new looking i sold both them 75% their original list price when we them . how cool ? they maintained their value . note : when potty training , don't forget buy character underwear . we bought elmo underwear baseball cap ( sport theme ) ebay it worked great . trained within days !!	1
this one best covers market great price ! you use these flat or prefolds without using pins or fasteners or it works fitted diaper	1
i purchased this baby registry gift out state friend . they keep raving how great it .	1
i using this changing pad two years it works great . only problem it rip . i am buying new one my next child but this time i buy changing pad cover go over it	1
ok just so you guys know , student child development safety , your child not suffocate due use bumper pads . only reason this happened because parents not securely positioned their sleeping child child rolls over , buries his or her face bumper , suffocates . you should , however , remove bumpers once your child able pull him or her self standing position crib , since bumper used step climb up fall out . i hope this puts some your minds ease .	1
safety reasons i reluctant purchase bumper . after looking this one person seeing it ties top bottom i decided purchase it . my daughter fine without it but i like color it brought crib . i wanted her able see cute animal design so i pattern facing toward her . her crib drop down side so i bumper pad running across back ends crib . i took excess pad wrapped it back around outside each crib end tied it . none solid blue shows . i am very pleased quality this bumper pad highly recommend it	1
this light umbrella stroller but performs like big bulky one . i able use it my grandson grows . i would recommend this my friends	1
we purchased this car seat our daughter when she turned one 20 lbs . we loved our peg perego infant seat but she clearly outgrowing it uncomfortable . so far she loves this seat i love safety profile color . she enjoys riding this seat it plenty room fits her size well . only 2 flaws i find i personally dislike 1 . you not hear distict " click " when you buckle 5 point harness . me this juat reassurance it locked . 2 . i dislike rubber strap covers may consider cutting them off . they make straps harder maneuver . i like velcro attachments side allow you pull straps apart when you put baby . this real time effort saver . overall we really love seat . we also purchased graco comfort sport car seat our secondary car it good seat overall but not nice britax . plus britax goes 65 lbs graco only 40 . britax definitely worth money better seat primary car	1
what great seat !!! excellent growth long term . i especially like sides seat offer great side impact protection . also five point harness accomodates child up 65lbs 49 " length . 5-point harness super easy use adjust . seat installation breeze latch system included . i bought my seat online travelingtikes.com who prices far lower than any other advertised price more than fifty dollars shipping included ..... right ! i purchsed tan seat " portland " best matched our car interior . im so happy britax rated so well their seat such household name which made my purchase much easier research . my little guy styling !!!	1
easy diner so nice take you anywhere . it sometimes little hard fold up or i would given it 5 stars . i just hope it lasts while .	1
if you baby , you've gotta regalo portable high chair . it most convenient item i've seen since strollers . it very high quality design materials . directions breeze . it washes easily , travels easily , looks nice just perfect item if you granny live small apartment but want grandbaby eat you often . parents love it too because they take it restaurants avoid using " contaminated " restaurant chairs . it perfect so many reasons . get one today . you'll glad you	1
when my daughter born , i didn't know swaddling , it would take me hours get her sleep ! i would feed or rock her my arms until she falls asleep , then put her her crib ... she'd flail her arms , wake up cry , i start all over ! what nightmare ! then i figured out since her arms wake her , it would make sense wrap her something so she couldn't move them much ... so i started wrapping her regular receiving blankets . it worked ! it became much easier get her sleep . but then she wiggled out those receiving blankets wake up again . when she little over month old , somehow i came across swaddleme blankets internet immediately bought it . it worked great ! it so easy wrap my daughter it , it stayed put . my daughter started sleeping so much better ! i wish i found those blankets sooner - it would've saved me so many sleepless nights ! 2 years later , my son born , thankfully i already knew those blankets start . he goes sleep great swaddleme blanket ! out curiosity , i tried put him sleep without this blanket , his arms wake him right away - exactly same my daughter ! i consider this blanket one most important baby items you could buy . it should must new mother who wants get some sleep	1
if you want your baby near you night , co-sleeper great . it makes getting out bed bit challenge , but it nice able look over see my infant daughter sleeping , or comfort her back sleep little rocking my hand if she not ready get up . very easy set up sturdy . my only complaint sheet- it shrinks lot wash , gets tangled up because velcro , not easy change quickly . also , replacement sheets expensive (@$15 ) . instead , i recommend using bassinet sheet- they exactly right size , softer , around $5	1
just received bag . material seems very strong . reviewer site mentioned only thing missing cushioned shoulder strap , so what i plan use removable velcro cushions came my daughter infant carseat put them straps so my shoulders won't hurt . haven't used it yet but plan take it plane real soon , i'm just happy booster seat so awesome it folds . update : didn't need cushions because it pretty light anyway . carseat fits well , it protects seat well when you check it airport .	1
really cute , very portable " plush " sports bag . various balls ... best part it not electronic !! each ball makes some sort jingle or crinkle or " boing " sound ... but they're great baby just handle or chew	1
we purchased this stroller take wdw . we pleased this stroller . we able easily collapse get off buses , it very easy manuever . despite it light weight , i able put three four jackets one bag back it without it turning over -- even without my three yr old stroller ! ( it tip over once or twice , it just took lot more than i expected it would tip . ) i didn't problems handles too short ( i'm 5'7 " ) , but my husband ( 6'3 " ) . but overall , only way it could better would one little cup holder . i've three different umbrella strollers this far best one i've owned . it ability maneuver through crowds turn quickly simply excellent ! price , i would not / could not purchased better umbrella stroller	1
very cute way cleverly protect your child keep them close . we two year old going amusement park his other sibilings , him hold your hand ( yeah , right -- not all time ) . he likes independent loves dogs backpacks so he feels like older kids . this helps , doesn't look like you your kid leash	1
it take lot get this lock open , but it literally only thing worked my house more than 24 hours . everything else too easy pull off .	1
i don't any stroller age kids , but avoid further loss coffee mugs off top my car i started looking cup holder i could attach my yakima roof rack . lionheart model i used year or more required extensive modification , it wouldn't hold insulated cups unless handle open bottom , but it once carried coffee mug safely bellevue seattle ! after it broke i found valco , which attached easily might even fit square thule cross bar . it seems lot tuffer , some closed handle mugs fit . best thing i'll talk parking lot ski areas	1
i really used this sunshade this summer . if fits really well both single stroller jog stroller i own . it comes off easily doesn't interfer anything . it provided both sun protection wind protection ( when pulled all way down ) so i ended up using it cooler days also . spf also bonus you don't realize how much sun directed little one even regular shade	1
i absolutely love this storage system ! after showing it one my girlfriends , she replaced everything she used baby #1 playtex used playtex system baby #2 . it very clean simple system minimizes risk contamination since you not transfer milk one storage device . it worked perfectly my medela pump style ; you use same bag pumping , storing feeding . i deep-freeze chest freezer used this storage . i followed manufacturer suggestion double bag freezing . i never any problems . if you want see how much your baby eating , clean hands , simply lift bag out ring drop it directly into bottle shell ( ring heavy-duty enough it lifts out easily ) . remember , when you breastfeeding baby directly breast , you don't see how much baby getting . dr. sears says , " baby who getting sufficient volume milk usually least 6-8 wet cloth diapers ( 4-6 disposable diapers ) per day after initial three days start-up time . enough wet diapers tell you your baby safe dehydration . " everyone different preferences , but i honestly can't see how anyone could dissapointed this storage kit . i only purchased two kits because most time , i fed directly breast , eventually , dd wouldn't take bottle , but moms who plan return work , i would recommend more kits . i really only used my kits beginning when i pumping lot because i so much milk	1
i really like this booster seat . cushioning soft comfortable my son . i also like head rest . some reviews i read talked how head rest acted like blinders their children . my son doesn't mind them all they keep his head stable when he sleeps which i love	1
i bought this my 4 year old daugher . i liked safety review this seat . my daughter loves everything it . i don't one bad thing say this seat . i've it 3 months it looks like it when i pulled it box . she spilled everything you could think it you can't tell . it even still smells new ! cushion just good first day she used it . i buy my 18 month old daughter when she big enough	1
i purchased this crib because its price colour . i nervous buying without seeing model one first . my husband put it together couple hours no major drama . my daughter used it since she 6 weeks old , she now 14 months . i love it , it sturdy beautiful , drawer underneath valuable storage ( we nyc ) , it easy me lower my daughter grew . i think it practical it converted into bed	1
my son born premature . i breastfed long i could but after he diagnosed severe acid reflux . i needed find bottle . he needed cereal every bottle thicken it , medications pain help move it his digestive track . first i tried playtex bottles disposable liners . amount gas spit up still quite lot i still unhappy baby . then my doctor told me dr. brown bottles . they bit more expensive then others but worth every dime !!!! clean up fine too if you just throw all pieces together nipple basket dishwasher . i never use bottle my future children ever again . i am so happy i found these . my son like different baby first time he used these bottles . gas gone , spit-up decreased well over half previous amount . i tell every mother soon-to-be mother i run into dr. brown bottles . i'll never buy brand	1
i initially tried avent wide-neck bottles my newborn didn't like them . those bottles leaked , nipples gave my son suction blisters his lips , he needed extensive burping , i didn't find graduations bottles correlate any other measures home my son seemed hard time getting hang how suck against negative-pressure builds up avent bottles . dr browns bottles solved all these issues . i am extremely happy them . you need get used washing small parts but once you routine going it well worth effort . it takes me under 20 minutes wash six bottles ( i prefer not use dishwasher ) . small brush which comes starter kit multi-pack varieties essential cleaning lasts 6-8 weeks regular use . i recommend going straight 8oz bottles buy 9-pack which available other websites . when warming these bottles , if you find fluid going up into vent , just loosen collar , column liquid goes back down tighten again . if breastmilk stored these bottles fridge , fat content tend stick plastic vent . you receive level-1 nipples starter kit/multi-packs , however you may want graduate level-2 3-months age , level-2 6-months age y-cut nipples any thick liquids ( e.g milk cereal ) . caps snap loudly which only ' con ' i think . use travel disc avoid leakage when transporting milk . my friend babies refulx well these bottles . my son doesn't reflux but i can't imagine using any other bottle him . highly recommend them would definitely buy agai	1
children seriously injured or killed televisions falling them . this product great idea , long it secured stand or shelf can't move . this one definitely worth $ keep your child(ren ) safe	1
we received this monitor off our registry . long time we never used sensor pad . we felt we didnt need it . few weeks ago our daughter started rolling onto her stomach middle night unbeknownst us . we would turn her only find her moments later , or even hours later , her stomach . we finally let her sleep her tummy becuase it obvious where she wanted . so pressure pad so sensitive it picks up 3 month old breathing . we only few false alarms but becuase she way over corner crib . hope helps	1
this great help our infant daughter . she sleepsacks since practically birth . she stays warm snug can't kick it off . we only use it night , so when it goes , she knows it bed time . it part routine now . highly recommended	1
i bought this sleepsack my 4 month old daughter she totally loves it . she sleeps all night now , where before she'd wake up like 5 am . she gets cold easily so i still put light blanket over her even though she sleepsack , plus it gives her added security , me some peace mind knowing she not buried under pile blankets . but i got mine marshalls $13.00 , sure beats paying almost $20.00	1
avent nipples wonderful my baby . i not experience nipple confusion when i started my son bottles i am still breastfeeding . i am very happy there products would recommend them everyone	1
we bought this our son last year christmas when he 3 1/2 months old . he liked it but we stuff blankets help him sit up . we bought this over exersaucer because we not room store anything large . he really liked it . he now 15 months old walking but still likes jump it . i put him there when i am cleaning he great time	1
i pretty petuina pickle bottom bag , baby bjorn diaper bag , baby sherpa bag i say none them functioned me . other moms i am sure those bags worked great them but this tiny compact bag greatest . i wish i this bag when my son first born . although it looks small it holds everything ! it gives you chance your hands free without even feeling like you wearing bag . i am love this bag . it so nice go out not feel like i am moving . my other bags they so big bulky this one it like i don't even it . again it must all moms !!!! if you get black gray it great dad well .	1
love this bag so my girlfriend who wanted steal mine first . it fits most essentials go out day mall or run errands . it even fits my wideneck bottles wallet . there not enough room change clothes , changing pad , or toys but that what bottom stroller . it very comfortable wear even over jacket not hurt your back carry it . it never way maneuvering your way through aisles .	1

i am extremely happy this product . i am disappointed line disappearing off internet fast though ... when i first ordered this there diaper keeper which i planned getting if i liked pattern , but it isn't available now :( i highly recommend this blanket entire collection	1
we bought this carrier after owning older one started look quite ugly . i must say , this company thought everything ! there place my cell phone right shoulder straps padding parent shoulder back area superb . i never thought i would use canopy this type product but i it great feature keep your little one dry . great job chicc	1
we love these bibs . they wash up easily fold up really small easy packing . they're soft , light , totally water proof	1
when my baby newborn , i felt i didn't enough control safely carry her this sling . it just seemed uncomfortable her head - it not like picture ( very thin !? ) woman newborn - they must proped baby head up take picture . i felt like she getting lost folds . however , now she 6 months i wear her my hip . new native sling awesome - it simple , material very nice soft , i take it off easily most important - she totally comfy , secure entertained , watching my every move !	1
this pretty good chair . over all i'm happy it , though i not like handle , my daughter now 16pounds it isnt easy carry her it . but most part , she likes seat its pretty pink , it fits well car i'm 99% satisfie	1
i think this item very good . only problem we steps could just bit longer fit our toilet better . when he goes set down steps come up off floor it gets bit wobbly . but he really likes idea climbing " ladder " using potty ( big toilet ) himself . potty training must one most challenging things teach child , every little thing make it bit easier great ! only thing steps they really need take off their pants/shorts before stepping up . they not step up get turned around them pulled down , steps not secure enough pull down their pants once they up there , least my son not yet without feeling like he fall . but , if it gets him more willing use potty this item doing its job imo	1
played non-electronic version , this upgrade help game play move more smoothly . there few drawbacks however . it easy accidently reset game pressing wrong button , since teams designated #1 #2 controller controller travels around room , it easy get confused give points other team mistake . this happens lot , especially if you're playing group who not played recently or not familiar game . fact there no multiple parts big plus . this very good group word game once everyone gets into groove	1
we recently used this my 26 month old son his britax marathon . it so simple . my husband help , we able attach it carry-on while my son remained sleeping his seat . my son real busy body hates strollers , so i worried he would not want sit it during our layover after stuck plane 4 hours , but he loved it . he actually couldn't wait sit it wheeled through airport . once we got our final destination , he actually threw fit because we would not take seat out car wheel him inside house	1
i traveled this summer my 18 month old . i planned take our car seat since we renting car when we landed . i layover each way , so i looking way move him through airport little fuss since airlines strict stroller policies . so , i found traveling toddler thought i would try it . it awesome so affordable ! it easy use , even when i unhook it security when boarding plane . my toddler ( who nearly 30lbs time ) loved riding through airport loved security sitting his car seat . make sure your luggage locking extension handle so you push or pull your toddler . great product ! i recommended it many .	1
awesome product , well worth money . only car seat i ever buy again !! comfortable , attractive withstands wear tear kids	1
after debating spending $$ this seat , i purchased this 2 others try our small suv . ( we land rover freelander . ) others bulky harder install . this far best 3 i bought . ( i returned other 2 ! ) not only it comfortable my baby , who so far used it 3 months 9 months old it still looks brand new ... but it also easy me put her . straps don't twist i love velcro holds straps side i put in/take her out . this model also rated highest consumer reports crash tests !! my daughter use this one til we baby needs it , then i buy big girl britax seat her	1
we extremely happy this carseat . we saw no need infant/detachable since we use sling carry our baby . one note though : if you plan using this seat newborn , make sure your purchase separate head support . our baby small , awhile even double headsupport wasn't enough keep her head falling forward . we just tucked folded blanket under her chin help give her support . one major bonus , she very comfortable this seat . when she went through her fussy , oops i mean high need ;) period , just sitting her this seat ( not even driving anywhere ) calmed her instantly ! we love fact this only carseat we'll need buy . when you take into consideration , not buy infant then carseat later , price not bad all . britax = quality safety	1
i bought this product arrival my second child . i bottle fed my first child well . this product timesaver/lifesaver ! i only wish i it 4 years ago my first child . key read directions carefully before using this product . if you use more than recommended measurement water warmer you scald bottle formula it won't cool down easily either . long you read instructions follow them , this product wonder joy use . cooler especially nice because it cuts down nighttime feeding process , but you must take special care not chill bottles longer than recommended 8 hrs . you'll love convenience peace mind ! if i only knew then what i know now ... :	1

we used this gate separate large room into two sections keep little ones out big kids ' activities . price it really worth it us . basically now we two rooms instead one , minus scary paranoia babies may choke small part toys . we've it 6 months , it still perfectly intact looks superb . since we apo ( overseas us address ) shipping always very tricky . usually companies charge huge rates ship it slow boat making tremendous profits alone shipment . this company , pegasus shop/safe baby shop exactly opposite : small shipping cost ultra fast shipment . we got it just few days our surprise . since then i deal business other inquiries they wonderfully honest helpful . 100% satisfied	1
i've this pump 5 months i use it before i go work morning , twice work , once when i get home . i little concerned first because such expensive pump motor only 90 day warranty . i plan keep my daughter breastmilk until she least one wanted pump would last . i tried one avent manual pumps , but i engorged before i would get few ounces out one side ( nothing out other ) . medela pump so much easier all work you . pump held up so far i'm really happy it . i bought extra shields bottles pack me take work , keep rest home . only downside i saw these bottles they made fit only medela products . otherwise , pump great i'd recommend it anyone looking something durable easy use	1
would recommend ..... clean great , work well long they screwed together properly	1
i tried many bottles my daughter . she originally used nurser bottles supplementation while i breastfeeding(low supply ) . they told me pump so i got cheap regular 4 oz baby bottles pump into so she could drink directly out . she started all kinds stomach upset . we then tried dr. browns bottles . they good but she trouble nipple . we switched wide neck dr. brown bottles , which she better , but still didn't like nipple . finally i got back out playtex nursers . upset stomach problem got better . she still reflux , i think always , but gas only occasional now . don't waste your time or money other bottles . easier clean too . you can't microwave these liners , but what i mix up days worth formula pitcher i keep fridge pour into liner just before ready feed , i then put liner formula glass hot tap water . it only takes minute or two warm up . then drop liner bottle you're ready feed . my favorite nurser bottles ez feed slider get air out . they sometimes hard find but really easy use . one comes newborn set or you purchase them individually babiesrus or publix grocery store . if there more than 5 stars these bottles would get higher rating . can't say enough good things them . also easy travel	1
i hate wash bottles every night these great time saver ! just throw out liner you only wash nipples . baby just loves them so hubby he like wash bottles either he likes how once you push air out baby feed any position long there suction . i don't premix because you can't put them microwave but we bottle warmer so it works just well . put powder bottle first before water or it won't mix wel	1
i live northern ga when i got pregnant i lived southern la , never thinking i would need something heavier than blanket my infant son . after first morning scraping frost off front my car my 4 month old son waiting patiently inside house car warm up , i realized i wrong . i graco windsor snugride travel system , so i ordered celadon bundle me , thinking two greens would match . it not perfect match , so i probably should ordered graphite instead , but far product goes , my son loves it . i even unzip top cover use it mat when we play friends ' houses or when we visit family top cover his pack play . my son likes snuggle down into bundle me i like i just unzip part it while we're driving if he starts get hot . i definitely suggest this anyone who lives somewhat chilly area . i probably invest lite version once spring arrives ; anything so my son doesn't get bulked up sweater or jacket just comfortable weather	1
i bought this toilet when my son less than 2 when i tired all typical childrens toilets . potty perfect because how portable it , my son could it near all times . biggest problem how small potty , even my son it somewhat tiny . he outgrew it very within 6 months but i feel $10 it well worth it . it served purpose i needed time	1
i thought monitor worked really well . i picked this one out because i loved glow light feature . it so much better use low light during nighttime feedings .... but light bulb receiver not replaceable :( i only used it 6months it burned out me already . it goes off after 15 minutes directions say it long lasting . well , not long enough i am contacting comopany warranty . hopefully they fix it	1
muy buena adquisici�n . el beb� se siente c�modo confortable	1
i searched all over every store what seemed like world just find sleeping wedge my 3-month old preemie son . he very bad acid-reflux sleep apnea ( he forgets breathe when he sleeping ) so he absolutely one . i bought this him he sleeping trouble-free ever since . height may only 2-3 " but it works really well , because any taller than ( i actually bought one try under first one ) his poor little head fall over he can't breathe . we him cradle thank god i found one fits it	1
i baby trend sit stand one step ahead which basically same this stroller . it rubber wheels cup holder few other changes . i like this stroller but i am not thrilled quality . wheels don't look all sturdy stroller some play you turn corners . since this our third double stroller ( 2 used ones before ) i think this way double strollers so they don't weigh ton or cost fortune . price , this definetly best double stroller out there . i love hinged front tray so you easily get toddler out . my [ ... ] son loves sit stand options it collapses very easily . putting back seat taking it off takes little time but not too difficult . second sunshade also great option during summer . this stroller going especially wonderful zoo mall .	1
i keep this stocked diapers wipes back my car , so when i go out my daughter short trips i don't need worry bringing diaper bag . it also great bring mall , etc . attach stroller	1
my son now 6 1/2 months old he loves it . he kicks away it until he tires himself out . it bit heavy you must make sure you tie it tight so it doesn't fall or get pulled off . sound 2 settings , low high . i read review said it very low , i suspect it might low setting . overall , i'd like see better way secure it crib but my son loves it	1
works great i use it often see things not wake up baby . item very dark orange when lit almost red . ( i might try yellow one next time . i hope it little lighter .	1
we love these wall hangings ! they come different textures , just like zanzibar bedding set . ours came loops hanging , so we haven't problems others seem .	1
i tried many other brands pads so many them leaked barely held any milk . i've also dealt fuzz sticking my nipples one brand . i tried medium heavy these they worked great . i wear them all night , or all day work , no leaks . i used ultra thin ones when i leaking little they worked fine , although i'm sure they wouldn't work if they very long . they visible through clothes , but i haven't found any aren't . i read reviews so many who don't like them , but me , they best i've found .	1
i loved this drying rack baby bottles nipples . i don't soggy dishcloth my counter anymore it really kind cute	1
this great product big trips or small . traveling alone toddler plane not easy luggage , stroller car seat . this product makes it easier . you option roll it behind you or carry it your back freeing up your hands push stroller . it may take little practice get car seat first but once you've it it easier every time . it also holds up airport luggage handling coming out few scrapes but intact ready roll . i also love it double duty sun shade car seat keeping it cool your little one . i highly recommend it .	1
my daughter actually picked this one out , she really wanted pink . other than cupholders convenient her " treasure " sippy cups . other cups we careful fear they spill out . overall it functions very well very easy change cars	1
i this mattress 3 years now . my daughter started using it newborn still using it her toddler bed age 3 . i no tears or springs popping described review . i guess you could buy 200 dollar mattress your kid , but it really matter ? you noticed how little kids sleep anything ? kids sleep car their neck bent 90 degrees side 3 hours just fine . they also fall asleep floor without complaining . this mattress soft fits cribs nicely . what else you need ? mine held up just fine . all all it good crib matress i would probably buy it again . if you like wasting money , you should buy pillowtop mattress 12,000 springs your kid . otherwise , just save money buy basic one like this .	1
this stroller completely serves its purpose . my little girl almost 3 31lbs , i think this one perfect little one who still needs place when your out , we tried umbrella strollers ( too small ) searched too long perfect one , then i found it here amazon best price ( i look everywhere ) , i read complaints handles low it made it uncomfortable push , well not me , i am 5'6 it just fine me my husband 5'8 we no problems . only drawback storage under it , but it such small price pay , you still put stuff there but not much full size stroller . i would recommend this stroller anyone i could who need transitional one , size all	1
it very good toddlers starting learn hold spoon , size handle great	1
i love these covers . bought several 18 months ago when my son born just recently purchased some other colors when my daughter born . they last through multiple washing , don't fade , or shrink . they some strings start unravel , but it no different than terry towel . tried other covers , this one much stronger significantly deeper side pockets . colors great too . definately recommend	1

this excellent stroller well worth money . my husband i purchased red one buybuybaby . we intended purchasing similar chicco one � price . however , after test driving them ( other brands ) store , maclaren won hands down . handles higher ( good tall people ); it sturdier than most other umbrella strollers ; it steers well ; canopy actually works shade child both sun rain . i would recommend purchasing organizer allows you carry water other bottles you . it worth extra $20 or so . when we fold up stroller , we just flip organizer over front	1
i absolutely love this stoller . i bought it because i am tall my cheapo $20 umbrella stroller causing back pain i kept kicking wheels while pushing . this stroller so much more comfortable push . fabric breathes easily my daughter doesn't complain when she get strapped . only drawback there no cupholder . i tried get generic one attach , but then folder wouldn't fold up . arg . all all , totally worth investment	1
these huge help getting started my first baby . i bought them whim boy glad . they help get my milk started because they apply light pressure which also helps extent nipple . they keep things ( such bra ) rubbing against very very sore nipples . great feature air vents top cups . they there get air nipple , ( you don't want them getting dried out , just makes pain feeding much worse ) . determined breastfeeding mom these fantastic until your milk supply comes steady pace . they not look flattering under tight fitting shirt ( loose always best anyways ) but what when you breastfeeding first few months things adjusting . i felt they looked better two huge wet spots leakage	1

i just received this stroller yesterday . i am 9 months pregnant i able bring it inside put it together myself less than 15 minutes . i notice right break crushed shipping . i called graco this morning they sending me new one free , no questions asked . stroller bit longer than it portrayed picture , but it still smaller than duo glider , it handles wonderfully . it definately something i would not mind taking mall ! i love how rear basket dropped down , not able access it baby seat peave mine my quattro tour single . it little tough get baby seat out because there not lot space , but it nice it so compact . i am sure i get better practice . if you looking double stroller , this one buy !	1
i owned quattro tour single stroller , so excited when duo version came out . i ordered it without ever seeing it , it definitely lived up my high expectations . simply stated , this heavy duty deluxe version duo glider - worth extra money if you afford i t.t he seats large enough growing children - i one yr old two yr old , i foresee they both fit stroller couple years . i " test drove " all other double strollers babies us baby depot , they all seem low seat backs , which won't give any head support if child falls asleep . stroller itself heavy , so if you lug it around or upstairs , keep this mind . i keep mine back my truck , so just getting it out no big deal . i read other reports stating it hard steer , i no problems steering all . one thing i say , if you tall person , this stroller awesome because it higher handle grips . i am 5'9 " , my husband 6'4 " we both use it ease . underseat basket large , there additional " cubby " under front seat great extra storage . parent cupholders child trays/cups designed well . fabric high quality . only minor thing i am annoyed low quality seat restraints ( " seat belts " ) . my single quattro tour duoglider both high quality padded seat belts much better buckles . this one very low quality nylon straps marginally acceptable buckles . ( i also received my box very poor shape - open crushed one side . i only noticed scratches stroller , so didn't feel it worth going through return process cosmetic issues . what up shipping ??? ) *** ultimately *** after hours " test drives " quite bit research , i would recommend this over all other equal higher dollar strollers . it overall very high quality , those worried style , it very sharp looking stroller person	1
i absolutely love these bottles . i used them all 3 my children great success my oldest almost 15 . gas never problem my babies hardly ever spit up . everyone always commented how nice my babies always smelled because they never sour smell babies spit up so much . i worked numerous daycare centers any time parent problems gassy baby spit up all time i always recommend platex nursers them . 9 x out 10 their problems drastically reduced thanks playtex . i am now pregnant my 4th baby though i plan breastfeed much i if i need back up bottle or nursing doesn't work some reason then playtex my bottle choice . all new bottles out there market playtex still my number 1 bottle choice . if there would any drawback all it would cost liners . but i often got lucky would find some yardsales or sale would stock up . also some store brands carry liners just good . i few plastic bottles around just case running out but my babies didn't like them nearly much i could always tell difference their happiness because they would get gassy again . buy playtex nursers . they well worth money	1
gate wonderful -- once you get it right . instructions don't give you clear enough directions i ended up putting latching piece upside down first time . pictures pretty useless , but once you figure out right way install it goes snap . make it more stable you keep gate locked swing only one direction which makes it extra stable against kids puching it . we move our once our kitchen remodel it came down simple went up new door way really easy . latch itself ours pushed down it not latch into place itself now but it very solid gate . over 2 years old it held up great . latch handle can't opened anyone small hands you squeeze both sides so anyone kids under 2-3 who open it installed it wrong . make sure latch hooked wall properly .	1
this swaddler must anyone who newborn , i two these we use them every time he sleeps , both night during naps . they so much easier then regular swaddlers he squirms out , or just come undone , arent big enough ect .	1
i received this bassinet gift while pregnant my second child , after telling my mother second time around i wanted better bassinet side comes down access baby easily ( one i used my first cheap hand-me-down bassinet , which fine , except i couldn't see baby or pick her up without basically get up out bed ) . this great find ! my son almost 5 months old now , he doesn't want leave this bassinet ( but it definitely time , he big his age really outgrowing it ) . things i am happy : * i am able see him without hardly lift my head all , pick him up without strain or get out bed ... wonderful ! * this mini co-sleeper , small unobtrusive . fits nicely next my side our bed , not whole lot extra room space . easy tote around when traveling well , once broken down quite compact . * folds up very easily , similar pack-n-play but even easier i think , once you know how it ( take mattress out , press buttons rails fold ) . * great little place store extra blankets , instructions , carrying case , etc , below , zipped-up compartmen t.t hings note : * mattress bit hard ( basically like pack-n-play mattress , board topped some padding polyester or whatever material cover ) , so i top it sheet it came , blanket i tuck tightly under sides . * mattress not sit flush side rails . lowered side rail sits same level your bed , baby mattress bit lower than ... so bassinet not exactly extension your bed , you cannot just reach across scoot baby you ( i thought it would like , but it isn't ) ... but actually i like this bit better after all . * they sell leg extensions raise bassinet height your bed if need . we needed extensions , after putting them lower side rail same level our bed . extensions made bassinet bit wobbly , which worried me some , but turns out it just fine , even my 2-year-old bouncing around it ! * our little one end up his head against side few occasions , but like someone else wrote , one side mesh , he just fine . you kind make sure mattress lies level its spot , kind hard explain without visual aid , but basically board mattress creates level surface , underneath it just mesh screen velcro connect sheet ( which also velcro ) right place . hopes this helps your decision-making !	1
when i saw this toy amazon , i kid you not , i jumped up down . this one most beloved all toys we bought our nephew , he lost cars over years . so i may buy it again just get them back him ... he loves it so much when i called other day , he playing empty garage . garage doors get off track momentarily , but it easy fix . if you teach child -- adults who play him -- put cars back their garages each time , it becomes marvelously portable toy which play hours . we gave it him around 21 months now almost five , he still likes it . it especially gratifying see such love no-tech toy kid who constantly receives toys light up , beep , other 21st-century tricks . here simple toys brings hours fun years years	1

i received pump style shower gift my first child over 3 years ago ( 2003 ) . due medical problems early i exclusivly pump child #1 . pump worked great . i used it several times day it very effective comfortable . i used it 3 months straight after she born . i stopped using it not because it wore out , but because pumping several times day months so much work i couldn't keep doing it . my determination ran out before pump ! after i packed it up planned using it again if i child . child #2 born early december 2007 i very pleased find my medela pump still excellent working order . child #2 professional breastfeeder day 1 so i only used pump when trying boost my supply or relieve pressure engorgment when baby wasn't hungry . i'd say i used it few times week first 2 months . after 2 months i go back work my pump style came me . i've working few weeks now i use pump twice day . it works good today it 3 years ago . quality not gone down one bit . i plan feeding child #2 exclusivly breastmilk long possible i'm confident my breastpump allow me so . if you plan going back work pumping , or if you plan multiple children then this great pump job . it lasts . its expensive , but better spend money upfront , get pump works great , effective , comfortable , last you through years than throw money away cheaper model you'll end up replacing . pump so great i'm willing bet it'll last right through child #2 if we decided child , it ready go again few more years .	1
i absolutely love this pump . it fast effective i get way more milk this pump than i any other i tried . also -- these things expensive so shop around so you don't overpay . i got mine private practice lc add little love.com got not only pump great price , but owner helped me issues i . bottom line - pump great but only if you someone help support you too	1
we bought this product back 2005 used it during international trip through several airports . it worked advertised all jumbo jets , elicited generally positive reactions other passengers flight crew ; however it could not pass through aisles embraer commuter plane we take short leg our journey . order secure it correctly airline seat , you may get seatbelt extender flight attendant . this car seat/stroller great if you travelling small kids ; they sleep comfortably it makes more efficient transfer gates . i share observation others made regarding its inability take bumps ... reason it not good choice beyond travel maybe use within shopping mall . car seat it ok , it just takes some getting used . we never used it rear-facing configuration , so i cannot rebut comments made other users regards their problems mode .	1
stroller little flimsy everyday use , whole thing kinda heavy ( especially baby it ) . it not hard transfer stroller car seat back , but you need little upper body strength if baby still it . i use it our regular carseat , but not our regular stroller . we only use stroller option airports . using it flying , i wouldn't without it . it faa approved , fits all airplane seats i've tried ( coach ) , it goes easily through security checks . it worth cost just this . i really like this product if you frequent flyer ; however , it kind money-waster if you don't	1

i originally purchased avent isis use dd because i sure i would feel like cow milk line if i used electric pump , i read great reviews isis . after first two months though , i decided isis rather uncomfortable use , massaging breast shield kept losing suction leaking milk out back , so i started researching pumps again . i knew i wanted medela , but some their pumps weigh 8 pounds , i knew i didn't want anything needed use complimentary " stylish backpack " . when i found swing , read reviews , i knew it what i wanted . it nearly compact hand pumps , but uses same two stage action more expensive medela pumps . it comfortable use , i've no problems leaking , it seems more efficient general i just really like this pump . you use double batteries power it , which great if you traveling ( airport ? camping ? ) best part though , came five minute ago when i realized threads swing match threads skinny airvent bottles only ones we get dd use !! no more random bottles , no more pumping one container then pouring into container use	1
i'm so happy i splurged bought this . i using manual pump , getting sore wrists it took forever . swing , though little pricier , totally worth it ! two-phase part really works well . i pretty dubious first , but it great help me i return par t-t ime work .	1
.... i would never bought second electric ! all other moms i know said get medela pump style , but i thought if i could just * maybe * get pump took up 1/4 " space made no noise $50 , i'd try it . i'm not all interested trying pump . i love two , so i keep one work one home , or weekends , when traveling , i use one then use other , both clean . i like avent bottles nipples too . it took series complicated training sessions show my husband how properly assemble use playtex ventaire bottles , but avent bottles require nipple , that it ! so easy	1

i trained my son using this method when he 2 years , 2 months . ( my mom used similar method me 1977 recommended it ) it worked really really well ! he took bit longer learn go poopoo first , until i realized he thought he " making messies " if he went toilet . i solved this taking him around house showing him dishes go cupboard , clothes closet , toys toy box poopoo toilet . he totally got it after . he only couple accidents i recall . i reminded him go pee pee quite lot first , which i believed helped . i stopped all liquid drinking hour hour 1/2 before bedtime him pee right before bed right after getting up . i would highly recommend this prodect everyone who ready potty train . :	1

i just bought this changing pad cover my baby who expected this summer , one things i little concerned if it would fit my existing changing pad my son used . we simmons contoured changing pad , which seems popular pad people use , i happy find it fits very nicely . fabric seem little thin , but i not know how well it hold up , however , until baby comes . pottery barn kids also sells really soft chamois covers variety colors $19 piece , i one those my new baby , too . pottery barn one bit thicker . once i test them both out i'll sure update this post let you know what i think	1

we very large opening our kitchen living room , this only barricade gate we could find . we went ahead bought it , it fairly easy install . pros : 1 ) you angle it so it custom fits your space . you also make it longer or shorter without buy extensions . 2 ) it gate , so you don't continuously step over it or take it down . 3 ) its soft mesh material means fewer bumps head our little one . 4 ) gate slowly closes after you walk through it ( but it doesn't latch shut , fyi ) . cons : 1 ) although gate opened one hand , it not easiest ( you move button then lift up , not huge deal , though ) . 2 ) its also not easiest close ( lift up then push down ) . 3 ) it wall mounted ( not pressure mounted ) , so it leaves holes wall . overall , i would recommend it	1
we nine foot opening into kitchen , which entirely off limits my daughter . we large amount small items there could easily choked , besides inherent danger kitchen . so my daughter kept out ! this gate one two would span distance this more affordable . my husband installed it quickly ( within ten minutes getting home ) , adjusted it size we needed , voila ! my daughter turning one this month gate looks like it when we bought it months ago . even when she puts her full body weight against mesh , trying " push " her way through , it doesn't give -- not mesh , seams , hardware , anything . i worried bar below gate annoying or tripped over but it so low ground it never issue . latch gate takes bit get used , but gate stays place even if latch dropped cradle not snapped . love it	1
i purchased this item my 6 month old i love it . it replaces need jacket i unzip bundleme when we out shopping keep my little one getting too hot . i still put hat him when its very cold out but i not problem wind blowing top flap off ( i seen complaint other reviews ) my car seat canopy never issue . material very soft inside my baby very comfortable it . i would highly recommend this product	1

we recently ordered this monitor really like it . it wonderful color during day clearly illuminated up 8 feet away camera night . we 900 mhz 2.4 ghz phones our home not any interference problems monitor . we older two-story home nursery top floor . i laundry basement or cook first floor kitchen both sound picture clear . i especially like time-out feature turns off display screen after few minutes but leaves audio monitor when monitor operating its battery . display turned big button top so if you hear something you want check out , just push button room view . it very nice . monitor belt clip also flip-out stand so it stable counter or wherever . i would recommend this product without reservation .	1
these placemats saved my oak table getting scratched forks etc . they great catching food before it hits floor or my childs lap . love them . i am now ordering set hand !	1
we love this item people always stop us ask where we got it ! it little hard clean , but i feel better using reuseable product taking effort wash it than i would if i used disposable plastic placemats . few wonderful waitstaff folks willingly cleaned it us restaurants . we only use this when we're out . we often wet suction cups help them stick . my 18 month old rip it off , but tells me he eating ! surface also bit clingy , so his toddler trick flinging his arms scatter food little tougher him ! this great product won major daughter-in-law points me my germaphobe mother-in -law	1
after using sunshine kids ultra mat 4 months , i purchased two more mats . this best seat protector i found several reasons : - it doesn't smell . i return everything i bought babies us due heavy rubber smell never went away even after airing products week . - it made two pieces so it used stages . use bottom piece only when using rear-facing infant seat , or both pieces when using front-facing car seat . - it made two pieces so it fits any height car seat . i britax car seat which really tall . other seat protectors not reach all way top my suv seat , so car seat rested directly leather , but this seat protector , i could raise back piece high i needed it fully protect my suv seat . - it thick enough even after months use , there no marks suv leather seats . - it indentations bottom portion accommodate car seats using latch system . note height issue : friend mine bought duomat 2-in-1 car seat mat , which he found very nice well it not smell . he return it however due fact mat not high seat his honda odyssey , his britax marathon car seat very top rested directly honda seat no protector	1
this good quality organizer , good value . i appreciate neutral colors , i no problems using velcro fasteners affix this changing table . middle compartments could little larger , but overall this great way keep some essentials close hand without cluttering up changing table	1
i bought this item little sceptical afetr reading some it negative reviews . i thought it going unsturdy . it light weight but it carried everything perfectly . i put my baby diaper it bunch her little bathroom things . velcro straps little too short my crib which i thought negative first , but i some pretty ribbon i tied it end my crib using little loop-holes back . it gave it prettiest effect . i would recommed this over anything . everything just reach away	1
this little lamb saved us suffering through sleepless nights . our baby loves it , especially whale sounds . really works calm her soothe her sleep almost immediately	1
this bib changed mealtime better ! i tried all sorts fancy bibs because i thought this bib would uncomfortable my tiny baby . boy i wrong ! after initial fuss she now loves this bib . she comfortable clean ! bib catches every drop food , water her super staining vitamin drops ! fyi even this fantastic bib can't shield you unexpected baby sneezes during feedings ! i stained ruined so many cloth bibs before i finally took this out box now i only use this one ! plus one my car go feedings ! more colors please baby bjorn	1
my son now self-feeding , so i looking bib would catch his mistakes but easy clean after each meal . although this bib bit stiff , it great job catching every single thing he drops . , it easy clean - i just wash it dishes after each meal it ready go next meal .	1
my wife i twins recently i went looking ( 3 hours internet searching reading reviews ) all kinds different nursery monitors . i even looked some costing over 500 dollars built wallmounts , ect . pretty much every thing i read said try this one . well they right . rechargable batteries . good clear signal even multi-floors . durable hand sets easy use switch base ( babies room ) other hand set . easy use . durable reliable . good volumn control . good response manufacture amazon when switch went bad . can't ask more than even if it cost twice what i paid . i strongly recommend this set product . i used others they can't touch this one . my babies more importantly my wife emotional well serious consideration finding something would make them feel safe communication . after 3 months continous use , i can't imagine better choice . it even allows us adults quiet time casue we know we hear everything even slightest wimper . yourself favor buy this . jay saldan	1
my son 3 1/2 this first seat his i able assemble get into car without one ounce help my husband . all others left me frustrated baffled . i overcome my fear kids seats this one ! next you'll find me out back putting up swing set all my own ;-) loooove it	1
we bought earlier model this seat when my son 4 , we still using it he turns 8 . we one each our two cars , we keep third out west coast when we there traveling . unlike other review currently posted this seat , we really loved cupholders - there room them pop out our car , so they kept out all time . they work water bottles , crayons , little plastic toys , etc . it held up well abuse , adjusts different sizes , looks sporty , generally gets thumbs up .	1
i live relatively small townhome , my son baby gear taken over most space . activity mats , jumpers , swings , kicking contraptions , i couldn't bring myself buy full-size high chair . i actually bought bumbo seat , hoping i could use this instead high chair , but didn't work out too well . so i pretty excited when i saw this high chair read good reviews . i'm happy report i love this this high chair ! vinyl seat pretty plush looks comfortable . he actually looks like he sitting little throne when he it . i strapped it onto barstool , it feels very secure . vinyl seat , rest chair material , easy clean . tray says dishwasher safe , but my dishwasher too small accommodate it . it doesn't seem highest quality chair , meaning some functions aren't easy use you might hope , like reclining seat tray , but it wouldn't deter me buying it again . it only $50 , so i wouldn't expect it any different . it also very portable , which isn't normal expectation high chair . overall , i'm very happy this product	1
i first admit there additional parts these cups need washed , but since we used dr. brown bottles , i used few pieces . soft spout these cups great , made transitioning cup so easy us . my son hasn't taken bottle since his first birthday , never missed them bit . there two levels spouts , one harder one softer . i've tried other soft spout brands , but leaking collars . avent cups never leak long valves inserted correctly . our little guy use any brand or spout type , but these his favorite nice sore gums . i really recommend these cups despite extra valve pieces ( which i simply pop dishwasher basket ) . you'll never spills your sofa or carpet	1
our child still short 7 months age her feet touch ground , but until she , she enjoys sitting playing it	1
we bought this walker my son when he 8 months old . he immediately loved it always wanted it . this walker so easy him turn corners move all around house . it keeps him busy , happy , hours . tray front also great put snacky-type foods him eat while he it well his sippy cup drink when he needs it . i would reccommend this walker anyone baby , especially baby really wants move	1
intstead adding yet musical instrument toy box , i purchased this her just over 2 yrs age . it our only xylophone , she loved it immediately . i still hear tingling chimes downstairs , when she upstairs bathtime her dad . she makes her own melodies . she hits any note sings her favorite songs it . it held up well	1
my daughter received small fluffles grandma when she 4-5 months old ... she visible reaction it right start , not spent single night without him past 5 years . we bought several backup fluffles , thank goodness , some lost but we able replace . i regularly wash them normal spin cycle normal detergent , i dry them gentle cycle dryer . they not fluffy texture fur changed bit but they held up fine	1
my twins 3 months old sleeping through night month because these blankets . they super soft keep my babies nice warm during cold nights ( especially their hands ) . i worried them pulling their blankets over their faces night swaddling receiving blankets wouldn't hold them ( they wiggle lot ) so these perfect solution . i'm ordering 2 more large size get us through winter . i highly recommend gifting these my expectant friends future .	1
this great idea , which i really thought my baby would enjoy since i read they loved swaddled . but my daughter not like swaddled all . so i ended up returning this product using our halo sleepsacks instead , which gave her hands feet more freedom . my advice purchase only one these before birth then if your baby enjoys swaddled then purchase more , if not you return it or not not feel bad it only $9.99 . also remember once babies move their hands around more freely they should not swaddled .	1
this product works very well . it long range , battery last long reception very good . also feature two ac adaptors helps save battery life receiver	1
i received this gift after my daughter born we used it first time today i love it ! it so soft warm i wish they made them adults ! colors beautiful entire thing washable . only downfall there no way cover her head without her suffocating . luckily there extra fabric top piece i tucked underneath my hand while i carring carseat it block horrible michigan wind . if there 10 stars then urban bundle me would receive all 10	1
my daughter only 2 half , but she off charts height weight . such , she simply didn't fit into her regular car seat anymore . honest , i little apprehensive switching her car seat booster seat before age 3 , but she very uncomfortable her car seat would cry whenever we stuffed her into it . so , i bit proverbial bullet bought this booster . one feature really interested me this seat portability . my father lives out state so we doing lot traveling . i wanted seat we could easily check airplane . this seat fit bill . seat not compact i would hoped , but it no bigger than small piece luggage could easily carried onto plane . however , i think this seat little cumbersome " carry " if you trying manage getting onto plane 2 half year old everything else comes her ( coloring books , portable dvd player , snacks etc ); so i more than likely check this seat . such i am going order carrying case ( i saw some reviews some folks checked seat box it came , but i find too cumbersome ) . seat itself , my daughter loves it . she very comfortable it calls it her " big girl seat " -- no more fights getting her into her seat !!! i love it compartment store owner manual so you always it hand . also , even though it not five point harness , i feel my daughter very secure it . i love it wrap around headrest , height couldn't easier adjust -- we figured it out before we even opened manual . when you thread shoulder belt through " catch " under headrest , it positions belt correctly over your child body so he/she not choked it . ( make sure you pull belt all way out then let it slowly wind itself back until it taut over your child -- this lock belt place ) . i would given this seat five stars if it folded down little more compactly and/or came carrying case ( it built handle , but if you going check this plane , i would feel more comfortable it something protect fabric ripping , staining etc ) . overall this great product which comparably priced other full booster seats which don't fold . i recommended this my friends	1
i 2.5 year old 16 month old this bag leaves my hands free carry them or hold hands without constantly adjust bag . it perfect size take just what we need not bogged down inconvient bag . very bottom pocket very easy get into without taking bag off , it great place your wallet keys . if you need carry sippy cups not bottles make sure they not too tall or they won't fit middle compartment ( which meant bottles ) bottle attachment good store snacks if you don't need carry bottle	1
i love it ! great way keep my daughter touching/chewing cart me touch cart handle . there loops attach toys 2 side pockets hold small items . i find material thickness perfectly fine , i mean come this isnt carseat it fabric meant barrier baby cart . if it padded or organizer back it would too bulky take up cart space . only reason i didnt give it 5 stars because safety belt too long it isnt attached product which means it most likely get lost ( mine ) overall great product makes excellent babyshower gift .	1
my daughter received this her first birthday still plays it two years later ! we've able use it naming colors , matching shapes , putting together different musical compositions . cartridge african beats/irish jig lot fun . we haven't any trouble dropping this toy it not playing ( it dropped/thrown/kicked .... loved ? ) . my only complaint price ! ( reason 4 stars )	1
bundle me nice accessory during cold winter months . it attaches very easily carseat , i leave all extra blankets home ( except light one ) . this particular model wind rain resistant , which nice keeping my little one dry . it great concept ; kudos whomever invented it ! i 2 complaints though . first , it not effective younger babies . my daughter just 7 weeks old , i don't zip up all way . this keeps fabric out her face . i use one light blanket until she bigger bundle me bit more snug around her . secondly , zippers aren't smooth i'd like them . they occasionally catch fabric inside , so zipping up sometimes more work , always when i'm hurry ! but overall , i'm glad i bought this . it nice barrier against wind , rain cold just one item	1
i couldn't imagine traveling wandering toddler alone all carry-ons car seat . this car seat carrier sure life saver . it easy use , easy roll easy fold store . it makes big difference those wheels . my only concern this product fabric , it thinner than i expected . if it sturdier fabric , it would perfect	1

my daughter breastfed , we started her 1 bottle day breastmilk when she 3.5 weeks old . she started using playtex ventair , no problems over month . then , all sudden , she went bottle strike . we tried different bottles ( dr. browns , avent , cheapies ) different nipple flows - she wouldn't take any them . when i found out soothie made bottles , i thought it definately worth try , since only pacifier she would take . she took soothie bottle instantly	1
minute we opened box i knew i made right desicion purchase this stroller . weight unbelieveable , ride smooth - one finger push what it takes ! my 7 mos . old baby girl looked very comfortable it , recline pretty good infant ( 2 hr nap proof ) . my previous purchase britax blue blaze ( sold it craigs list day after we received it ) big mistake . spend little more get whole lot . good stroller good investment	1
these great - our 8 month old can't rip them off table like she everything else that not taped down ! one note , though , you can't use them restaurant booster seat trays - you need totally flat surface . overall though , placemats great , cute designs , bonus purell doesn't hurt either	1
little annoying first , but once you get used them , they great	1
if you planning stay home you going pump only couple times day ( maybe 2 or 3 ) this great pump . i didn't know how use it first but after calling medela customer support line i able use it easily . i didn't rate it 5 stars only because you can't use it many times throughout day ( your hands would hurt ) . but other than i think great pump price	1
i really recommend this product ... our baby not like bassinet some reason , newborn , we didn't want him too far us . this perfect solution , although i would agree some other users it takes up quite bit room bed . but i honestly didn't mind little squished given my son slept so well it he right next us . , it great travel	1
i bought snuggle nest when my son almost 10 weeks old . we realized he slept better smaller more confining places where he could touch sides all times . he sleeping through night his baby carriage but getting too long it . this perfect . i put it his crib ( bottom so he couldn't wiggle out ) he continued sleep through night	1
we used floppy seat couple years when our daughter young . it extremely easy use . no , i didn't usually install it one hand while holding my daughter ( although i few times - it not hard ); i normally parked near cart , put cover ran belt through , then took my daughter out her car seat placed her shopping cart . ( why carry your baby heavy diaper bag through parking lot if you don't need ! :-) ) it bit stiff get into stuff sack first , but after one or two washings , it cinch put it stuff sack when we finished using it . it fit all shopping carts we used , including oversized ones costco . it held up well repeated washings - bit faded , but still looking fairly brigh t.t here hardly time we went shopping someone didn't come over say " oh ! i wish we'd one those when my children small " . overall , we very pleased this product	1

we just came back vacation over holidays used toteatot first time . it lifesaver ! i purchased it right before we went away because i agonizing how we going manage all logistics maneuvering through airport all gifts bringing , plus our luggage ourselves , without losing one our kids process ! it worked just it promised . it easy attach suitcase car seat . our son happy clam getting wheeled through airport . we could easily bring his car seat plane without lug it through airport ! car seat must-have airport happy child happy neighboring passengers ! we able carry our gifts carry-on because we didn't want check them , we brought carry-on suitcase case our other checked luggage lost , we'd least essentials our little one rest us . we no problems it all . it pockets us store my son bottle , we able use backpack portion toteatot hold his diapers some toys . i read review where they experienced issue buckle , but we no problem all , fact , i worried we perhaps over-weighing it because all stuff we hanging off our roller suitcase ( besides just toteatot , car seat our son , like my handbag , laptop computer ) , but again , no problems all . just lots smiles curious faces airport ! i'd highly recommend it .	1
these wonderful ! when you first get them thick fluffy - so soft ! after some washes ( washing soda borax ) i found mine aren't soft , but they still very nice . they thick . my baby heavy wetter rarely soaks all way through these . picture this website makes it look like front diaper isn't contoured , but it . it just not wide front back , it should . if you like you just use these pin either side they'd work great without anything else , though there no elastic prevent leaks out side outside would get damp . you also can't tell picture there rectangular doubler sewn into inside these - one line stitching right down center hold it place . it full length diaper . i think i would rather it stitched both sides so one side wouldn't accidentally get folded over wrong way , but then perhaps would caused bunching problems . i use bummis super whisper wrap diaper covers these they fit perfectly . i no complaints . after numerous washings they haven't started fall apart like some others . i really like them	1

any pregnant woman knows , some point during gestation it becomes nearly impossible sleep comfortably . when you can't sleep your back , you can't sleep your stomach , your only choice balance your side your belly slowly pulling you off balance , your body actually gets pretty tired . after getting very little , uncomfortable sleep some weeks , i searched desperately relief . i intended purchase snooggle full length body/pregnancy pillow since they it target online where my baby registry . some time passed i decided go straight target person get snoogle only find it not there . but , boppy pillow i got it right away . i say it one best products i bought during my pregnancy . i would not good nights sleep without it . some people complain preggo pillows they bought take up too much room bed , but this one nicely shaped hug your body cushion where it needed without too much extra bulk . slipcover comes it very pretty easy take off wash . it also comes zippable pillowcase you fold whole thing into make one nice round pillow . i am still using this pillow after my son born , since it folds nicely different ways makes nice pillow just recline . definitely must any pregnant woman ! you won't regret it	1

i purchased this product because i crib converted toddler bed , but it didn't come any kind railing keep my little guy falling out . since toddler bed uses crib mattress , i little concerned large size bolster -- it covers entire length mattress -- but my son figured out how climb right over it get into out bed . it pop off mattress sometimes when he getting or out , but it isn't too difficult strap it back when i tuck him . i couldn't find any other kind railing fit my son bed , so bedbugz saved me just pile pillows floor next bed	1

we bought this same high chair 10 years ago when my first daughter born we absolutely loved it !! time , only reason we bought it because they it all white we didn't want one colors all over it . but far high chair goes we loved every thing it , super easy clean reclining positions great determined 4 month old .. ( they always want table everyone ) . also , many times my kids fell asleep while eating rather than wake them , all i recline seat they would sleep out problem because it such comfy seat cover . it held up wonderfully 7 years . we thought we kids got rid it , now i am expecting again i researched high chairs all over again , decided this model still best your money out there . we buying this again !	1
i two kids use my evenflo carseat . i hated it . it like they never even tried it out see how well its features worked . i finally got so sick it when my 2nd child 4 months old i ordered babytrend flexloc . first i seduced high safety ratings , but even after consumer reports article rescinded , i still liked lot features . pros : -very comfy seat , good padding -the canopy twice long my evenflo so it cover baby almost completely- canopy stays place ; it doesn't fall forward or backward behind seat- tightening mechanism under baby feet easy reach very easy adjust make straps tighter or looser depending what baby wearing- harness mechanism very easy adjust ( shoulder strap height ) . my evenflo rethreaded every few months even my mechanically inclined husband said it horrible . flexloc just dial back you turn--it breeze . - seat transfered cars without base . it strapped directly car using seat belt car seat or using latch system if your car it . - triangular handle nice grip easy hold any position- this carseat lighter than my evenflo- cloth very wipeable , not absorbant spills stains my evenflocons : i found few minor cons definitely would not deter me buying this carseat , one might ( depending how i resolve it once i contact babytrend ) . - release button take seat off its base toes under seat . it little harder reach than ones behind head if carseat backward facing . - others said , buttons move handle bit stiff , but not horribly so . i prepared them way worse . - handle thinner doesn't feel sturdy my evenflo when carrying baby around , but it hasn't any problems-this one big one i check babytrend : twice when i turned corner sharply , carseat tipped 45 degree angle ! i tightened down seatbelt much i could , putting my full weight it using seatbelt retracting mechanism . but maybe i'm still not doing it right . base narrower than my evenflo , so maybe that why ? so i need contact babytrend see if they any suggestions . until then , i guess i'll take corners slower ! overall , i felt like this seat major improvement over my evenflo even over graco snugrides i checked out store . it intelligently designed easy use adjust baby grows . i would recommend it sure . just make sure you strap it tightly or use latch system if you it	1
we just received this bed it really nice bed price . my husband i very little trouble putting it together . we highly recommend it	1
i love this changing pad ; it great no matter where you ! i change my son diaper some crazy places i know he clean this surface it easy wipe clean if he makes mess . it little cushion it well case you need use it hard surfaces it folds up fit my small diaper bag nicely . i really like wipe pocket small zipper pocket too	1
i loved my doorway jumper . noise i could've without . it really kind claws it way into your head then you hear it when you lay down take nap want sneak other room toss it . but said , i don't know what these other reviewers talking . my baby great time her jumper it fabulous way burn fifteen minutes . anymore than i recommend exersaucer . i mean , how long you just jump before it gets boring . just put jumper wide doorway you won't problem baby hitting their hand against doorway or whatever people complained . god sake , when your kid over like 20 pounds move something else . all it all , i think this great investment	1
this best car seat i owned . i three children owned many " light weight " " easy use " car seats but explorer best one yet . extremely light weight easy carry . base best part clear bubble levels both sides easy one hand isntallation . it uses seatbelt like clips hold " latch " system connections place . only down side required use base but extremely minor issue newborn car seat . excellent product ..	1
fabric good quality . it different textures animals seem pop out you . my two month old loves staring it . matching mobile , sold seprately , worth look , too . it doesn't any fancy lights or anything , but my son adores it .	1
zanzibar best ! we love it all . it good quality wecouldn't imagine our nursery anything else . we so picky what we wanted , but we made right choice . we recommend everything zanzibar line . ( we got most things babiesrus-baby depot some other things babiesrus didn't - light fixtures , nightlight , etc .	1
my daughter turn two loves pretend cook feed her dolls . i chose order this item her birthday during free shipping promotion after seeing poor choices play food offered my local toy stores . it disappointing most play food available fast-food branded ( i.e. mcdonalds) ! even " knock-off " tubs play food primarily junk food - hot dogs , donuts , cupcakes , ice cream cones , etc . i chose this set because it consists foods my daughter primarily eats - fruits vegetables , eggs , cheese , bread , etc . some pieces solid plasic , some hollow , which leaves greater question durability . but even hollow pieces made very thick , rather ridged plastic which i think stand up ok over time . i am not even able squeeze them myself . i also like foods small side actually fit small pots pans sets available right now ( although we set aside few questionably small things , like carrots mushrooms , until she older ) . definitely worth price , i think , when free shipping available .	1
i purchased this thermometer 18 mos ago absolutely love it . it quick easy use , there no maintenance . those who trouble finding probe covers , they sold walgreens or any other drugstore . they not first year brand , but walgreens brand works just well . i hope this helps . please consider this theremometer , your children thank you because unintrusive , painless readings	1

this must item . it makes bath time so much easier ! i using this since my baby 5 months . he 90% weight scale i never problems getting him out seat . course you still watch them all times ! but this seat gives baby some freedom splash play out option crawling around tub . highly recommended	1
my baby loved this car seat start . we've used it through all stages , including rear-facing , now forward facing my currently 19 month old toddler . seat easy adjust baby grows , easy install using latch system . removable infant padding perfect . biggest bonus adjustable crotch strap padded cover shield prevent chafing scratching baby legs . i'm due my next baby month already added second one these my baby registry . wonderful car seat ... you not disappointed . ( note this seat quite heavy , best permanent installation single car . i would not recommend it repeated swithching other cars because it weight .	1
i saw mother store one before our daughter born thought it good idea buy one well . i use it everytime every store dont leave home without it	1
i searched high low double stroller wouldn't break bank i very happy my purchase . i two-year-old son five-month-old daughter both kids like facing forward . i also like side-by-side style . i couldn't see myself pushing " stretch limo " i've heard it called . it easy maneuver , i fit down most aisles , it fits trunk my compact car full load groceries . drawbacks : canopy could bit higher , ( my son thinks it game when i pull it forward immediately pushes it back ) , seat covers velcroed place tend slip when i put kids , i need fold it before it fit through front door house . i've also taken it two cross-country plane trips layovers . baggage handlers general aren't very gentle front bars come off fairly easily when stroller folded . one now small rip it , but i'm lucky it didn't get lost . overall , i've happy it	1
we this seat my husband car , so i not used this much our infant seat . now my son outgrowing infant seat , i using it more often . i bought it great ratings , only thing i don't really get why there prickly velcro side straps where baby arms rest . i'm wondering if i'm doing something wrong . it seems like velcro hold straps out way putting child seat , but when buckled , they sitting top his legs . i am also looking car seat stroller fit this , no idea where look ! i'll post again , after i use this seat more , but so far , so good	1
this works well , but if your door handles thin , you may need add some additional padding make sure this springs back locked position . i taped some cardboard around some our very thin " elegant " door handles make this fit better . note some reviews elsewhere state installing this one side your door could lock you out other side . flat out wrong , regardless what type handle or button other side door . i used screws -- i wouldn't count double-sided tape protect my child . if you use tape , then i would try kind comes 3m removable hangars . it very strong removes without damaging surfaces	1
we use this our daughter crib it great . it easy install durable .	1
i looking toddler cot take trips my grandson . i think i found best one market ! this cot so easy use it travels like dream . i set it up myself i able collapse it return it it carry bag myself well . furthermore , my grandson thought it great	1
i 6 1/2 month old twins , so needless say , i need all help i get . i found hip hammock far easier more comfortable than sling style carrier . i such great experience this i'm getting second one keep sized my husband so we both carry baby same time - walks or other outings , or even just around house . i highly recommend this product . it very easy , very comfortable	1
this wonderful car seat . ( i purchased it cobblestone design ) it wonderfully made convertible car seat , much better value higher-priced alternative car seats . we britax before purchasing this one , i think i'll definitely stick evenflo ! this one best-rated car seats , less than half price britax ! it super sturdy , great safety features , everything you'd want great car seat . it little bigger than i expected , trouble getting it my car , but we used infant car seat so i didn't keep mind it'd bigger because baby bigger ! also , firs t-t ime parents , i would definitely recommend getting convertible car seat instead infant car seat . infant car seats only maximum 22 lbs , baby usually reach 7 months ! i paid $200 infant seat , hardly got any use out it ! convertible ones go until child reaches 40 lbs . much smarter more economical choice .	1
we already evenflo triumph premier . after few initial problems one , we got used it my ( large ) 9 month old son very comfortable it . i decided buy titan because it also good safety ratings lighter than triumph . second seat , we wanted something more lightweight portable since it would moved my husband car grandparents ' cars . it very easy use , equally comfortable triumph , but slightly less plush . i find more simplistic harness adjustment much less struggle titan . my husband #1 complaint expensive triumph . good all around seat purchase . no complaints	1
our daughter this seat since she 7 months old . it fantastic !!! she now 3 1/2 i recently invested $50 into seat . i replaced harness hugs fortunate find new cover clearance children shop seattle . it now looks like brand new ! we use it 2001 toyota tacoma double cab , 1996 chevy suburban , 2003 bmw x5 . toyota bmw get proper fit we remove head rests . no problem ! wieght , i am ok lug heavy seat if it means my child best protected she . when you get seat into whatever car you want it , my recommendation literally climb into seat one knee pushing much your weight into seat possible . we this when installing ours it doesn't move millimeter ...... our daughter always comfortable big cushy seat , doesn't slump when she falls asleep , can't escape it , i never deal twisted straps ! well worth money , * inconvenience * weight size . crazy people would spend money this knowing it safest seat then just because it heavy put your child piece junk car . accident only going happen car best seat ?? think again !! take time it right ! if you trouble installing it find local fire department or insurance agency properly install it you !!	1
i cannot say enough positive things this item ! i absoloutely loved fact it helped keep my son warm cool nights but it safe enough him use his crib every night . this item needs brought mainstream so it available all parents their kids .	1
these wonderful ! my baby getting uncomfortable swaddled three months , so we decided make switch sleep sacks . we worried her arms free she might hard time falling and/or staying asleep . this true first so we started only putting her these during daytime - light cotton one . after week she not waking early her naps anymore after two weeks we tried her it night - she slept straight through night ( she when she swaddled ) . so transition painless she seemed much happier baby able reach her hands move her arms . while i didn't notice shrinkage i notice zipper bunch up bit , but this hasn't problem . sometimes my daughter sucks it if it gets close her mouth , but she reach it - it doesn't cover her face all or trap air she could rebreathe . i didn't like these don't sleeves so i tried carter sleep sacks found sleeves too short hard get my daughter . those sacks only come one size which my daughter already outgrown four months ( 14 lbs , 24 inches ) . she also outgrown small size sleep sack , but medium size fits her perfectly some room grow . i didn't want use fleece first since it polyester . i wanted use cotton . but we've found she sleeps longer seems prefer he heavier fabric fleece one . also , we only bought these blue even though we girl because color calming our easily overstimulated baby . we've washed these many times they look just good hold together just well they originally . we've also found you put your baby into next larger size without it so big they get their arms out or it bunches up around their face . so after everything we've tried we've loved these sleep sacks day one	1

our 2 year old daughter small-side when she started potty training so sitting big potty little scary her . handles side little brace back helped her feel more stable . i would recommend it small toddlers who might fell little insecure sitting adult-size toilet first . it look nice too , so we don't mind it sitting our bathroom .	1
we ordered these my daughter 2 years ago when she born they made nice , thick cotton . one i just received made thin , cotton fabric not nearly nice . they really overpriced too my opinion . but they still best swaddling blankets out there .	1

this great keep necessities close hand . also , i don't understand people saying wipes warmer not fit . prince lionheart ultimate wipes warmer fits securely . it two slots bottom slide diaper depot . it even says box it made fit . maybe it changed since others ' reviews-it fits perfectly works great !	1
i write this , this car seat not available amazon , but i wanted give it review case they get it stock again . i bought this my son who out grew his infant carseat when he 5 months old . i wasn't ready switch him his " big boy " carseat yet because i like fact i take him out car without waking him up . this seat great because it goes up 30lbs 32 iches , but seat itself heavy . also , many reviewers said , fabric not breathable my son sweats like crazy it . canopy nice big , but it falls down back when not use nuisance . i ended up taking it off after 2 months . all all we love seat , it just needs different fabric something stop canopy falling down back	1
we looked tons baby seats when our son outgrew his infant seat . i wanted something would still fit he got bigger . it added bonus airline certified , so if we ever need fly somewhere i know he buckled up safely . my husband says it dream install we switch it easily grandpa car . i also like peace mind knowing it high safety rating . it very expensive , but i believe it worth it it good up 100lbs , so i plan use it several years .	1
i ton research before buying this seat , we loved it so much we bought ! it far easiest use ( i've used lot car seats ! ) best features . i really like you don't take seat out adjust harness height . fact this seat used forward facing up 65lbs 49 " what sold me it most . i wish this seat around my first child , who off charts height , we put him booster seat age 2 because he too tall any car seat we could find . total side impact protection big selling point , no other seat ! it easy install , rear forward facing-i used it explorer , escape tahoe no problems . people said it bulky , but it not really any larger then other seats , just taller . compare them side side store you see :-) seat also very comfortable long trips ( 8hrs no complaints ! ) . thing i really like this seat straps don't get twisted ! we alpha omega straps forever twisted such pain ! we using this seat year no complaints what so ever . there so many wonderful things this seat i could go all day . i seat inspected person told me britax best , far exceeding us safety standards . it well worth price peace mind you . we also britax parkway booster seat total side impact protection love it well ! ps- i read others seat cover not machine washable , i washed it delicate cold water it no damage-looks good new	1
