we bought our machine 2 weeks ago . it looks wonderful , nice sturdy , alot different features , but we haven't able use it . it didn't work day we brought it home fighting ironman customer service department ever since . they keep giving us runaround saying different technicians coming but nobody ever shows up . evertime we call their 1800 number we're hold least 30 minutes before we even get talk person then they just lie say they either call us back or someone out day . well after 2 weeks , we've it ! we're taking it back never buying ironman product again . they're nice machines good warrentys but what good it if they won't get anyone out there fix it ? nothing against store , they've great . just 2 big thumbs down manufacturer	-1
i purchased this bike rack because i moving out state didn't enough room back my car bike . i also needed rack transport my bike local trails , parks , etc . so , i went schwinn given brand name it relatively inexpensive . i drove nc fla , approx 700 miles , bad idea this rack . i didn't any trouble assembling rack , only took 5 minutes ready go . however , during my trip , i pull over side interstate no less than 5 times tighten straps back . buckles not hold straps place . this real problem if you travelling highway ( or any busy road ) you worry your bike flying off back into oncoming traffic . also , even if buckles hold , wind drag bike starts pull brackets right off rack frame . i purchase 4 bungee cords rope order secure my bike flying off back ( yes , rack assembled correctly ) . bottom line , this rack probably great value if don't plan driving more than few miles or over 40-50mph , otherwise , it complete waste .	-1

let me first say i not purchase this mini stepper through amazon , but rather directly discovery channel store . two weeks after i submitted my review their product their web site , however , they still not seen fit post it . i used discovery electronic mini stepper daily 29 days ( 30 minutes per day ) before cable around pulley-wheel broke . this seems consistent problem this piece equipment , judging previous reviews dcs ( discover channel store ) web site . inside 30 day return window , i sent my stepper back refund . customer service , i must say , excellent ... only product itself cheap substandard . related note , this third mini stepper ( various brands , not all dcs ) i owned past year . they all broken down one way or . feel free look some my previous reviews here get details , but bottom line this my last mini stepper . take some advice me when i say these machines built people who beginners world fitness . say , if you intend use mini stepper two or three days per week 15-20 minutes , then you may satisfied one . however , if you advanced or even intermediate stage your workout routine , then don't even consider one these machines - you destroy it , trust me . there just too much go wrong -- pulleys cracking , pulley cables breaking , shocks leaking ... i actually broke frame one stepper . through all this , i learned one important lesson exercise : keep it simple . i am now great success some simple resistance bands ( many varieties available here amazon ) cardiovascular exercises ( e.g. regular old jumping-jacks ) . i get better workout than any i ever got mini stepper , i'm feeling great even lost little weight right places :-) honestly , if you want save yourself some grief , please learn my experiences avoid horrible cycle mini stepper destruction . just buy yourself some resistance bands , maybe jump rope , exercise mat , instructional video/book , then get work . exercising tone your body lose weight isn't easy ( if it , then you're probably not doing it right ) , but you make it easier not wasting your time money junk like this	-1
brunton nexus star low-cost , fairly rugged , basic compass . like any low-cost compass , if you know how use it you get where you want go , but it lacks features you may later wish you . plus side , it lightweight , inexpensive , fairly thin , so it doesn't take up lot room your pocket . minus side , baseplate very short , so it harder use map little less accurate when reading bearing . biggest disadvantage , my opinion , it doesn't true declination adjustment ; it advertised " declination scale " which not same . baseplate compass , you take bearing lining up compass needle inside north reference indicator ( sometimes called " doghouse " ) etched bottom vial . compasses true declination adjustment allow you rotate this " doghouse " align it desired declination . way you always read bearing aligning needle inside doghouse . nexus star , however , you can't this . instead , you remember line up compass needle point scale corresponds local declination . this case , needle not boxed inside doghouse , i find it lead errors , especially when you tired not thinking clearly after long hike . if you always navigate using magnetic bearings rather than true bearings , this isn't problem . i recommend this compass use gps receiver set read magnetic bearings , it suitable back-up compass . i also regularly use it inexpensive tool teach students my gps classes how use compass , but i wouldn't recommend it serious work	-1
this ball radio controlled remote size small cell phone . ball two small holes ( smaller than size dimple ) opposite sides connect battery operated charger ( 2 aa ) . remote uses 9v battery . ball small internal battery apparently replaced if needed once it longer hold charge . ball operated couple minutes after charge . ball not meant hit , but probably withstand putter hit short distance . because rolling weight circuitry within otherwise hollow ball , ball not roll straight its own . ball looks somewhat like real ball but slightly off-white color obvious seam . when using remote control ball , ball revs up 2-3 seconds making rattling sound , then it takes off still rattling away . arrow ball present let you know initial direction ball roll . you reverse ball direction , but you can't make it go left or righ t.t he two biggest drawbacks this gag ball : 1 . you only direct ball two directions ( front - back ) remote . 2 . fairly loud rattling noise made ball probably heard 20 yards away . gag ball , it seems like it only limited use . but $10 , what more i expect	-1

" he nearly killed me , coming fast me , broadside . he regained nearly 15 or more mph he started his right turn , still accelerating , when he spotted me panic-braked . we one point 2 feet apart , thanks his hard braking , my veering left ( luckily deserted ) dark main road . i , fraction second , looking down his headlights bumper almost below me . could reached over touched his hood ornament . incredible experience . it my closest call ever , scared hell out me . it must've scared hell out him , too . he registered his shock-and-awe reproaching after-fact horn blast , he scrambled around passed me , racing off before i could read his plate . i guess it must've ticked him off , my scaring him close call . one little vehicular manslaughter change your address awhile . equally maddening him , after he passed intruding cyclist red blinkie taillight , white helmet , all reflectors ( those alerted him , once i his front-and-center target ) , he would then see blazing headlight pencil-beam his rear-view mirror . damn , nuttin ' he could blame this creep bike . :-[ el-300 simply failed me time , i see it , focusing most its light narrow , long-projecting beam . it focused left where he looking , when i very close side street he traveling , ignoring his stop-sign . there should , so much light energy , some part diverted wider , closer bike , even if lower intensity . my judgement there two related design flaws this lamp : 1 . narrow focused beam , making you " live (??) " single direction which you aim beam . its relatively dim peripheral light gets lost any ambient light . 2 . turn aggravated its wandering aiming you settle , both vertically horizontally . vertical part worse ; mounting clamp sets too far back headlight balance-point , so it seesaw that forward-heavy . lift your bike front , tap it down lightly , you've likely refocused lamp lower , you would not if mounting balance-point . aim it temporarily right ( tight ) , you seemingly good go ... but only far first noticeable bump . it then drops few degrees , you keep correcting it vertically , light either your intended path , or oncoming drivers ' windshields . your need like oscars : you want both see , seen , only this case save your life . i am chasing after led lamp now , which i understand wider ( brighter ) beam . i respect cateye general . their current website page battery-op headlamps not offer el-300 .	-1
i purchased this product performance bike replace much older ( 10yr ) cateye wired computer . i certain amount brand loyalty cateye because their products typically higher quality ( almost always manufactured japan opposed china ) typically last long time , like aforementioned 10-year-old cycle-computer . i purchased this product without much hesitation , but disappointed unusually stripped feature set . cateye vectra missing two critical functions : ride timing , average speed : features even my 10-year-old velo2 computer . it offers only current speed , max , odometer , clock , trip distance . overall quality unit good , i'm sure it last years solid japanese construction , but i'll seek unit because missing features make it unusable my purposes . luckily , sender unit magnetic pickup reverse cross compatible cateye other wireless computers , i.e. it works my older cateye cordless 2 computer also . bottom line : pick cateye model watch feature set carefully	-1
i'm charge weekly touch football game where we use official nfl football previous year i wanted get one backup . i know ' duke ' supposed official nfl ball this year , but there seems something wrong balls amazon shipping . first ball i got amazon hard rock , slick all get out poor stitching laces . i got second one stitching bit better , but it still hard slippery . when it exposed rain , ball stained hands everyone who touched it red coloring . i no clue if that expected or not since it all leather but it seems odd . any case , you grip ball good pair sticky football gloves , which also help mitigate pain catching ball . so , it usable throws nice spiral but maybe i play ball bunch wussies cuz no one else wants get near thing out fear breaking their hands ( which kind annoying given how much i paid balls ) . maybe footballs just need broken , but i'm not really sure how aside playing them , which no one seems want . i've tried let some air out make things more user-friendly , but it doesn't really help . anyway , i find it really hard believe this ball nfl played this year . something them just seems cheaply made . any case , i suggest you save some money go decent composite leather ball .	-1

my son hit . 515 8 year old last year . this year , he moved up division struggled around . 250 , even though he fairly nice swing . using this device two weeks , he suddenly can't hit anything . i pitched him hardballs today he swung over top every one first 60 ! problem this device ball doesn't drop like pitched ball , so it actually trains them swing higher than normal . i'll putting this away season trying recover my son swing confidence . don't get me wrong , kids love it . entire team lines up before every game begs you throw fastballs it . it great use around house - just tie it tree you take swings you couldn't otherwise . beware if you intend use this much more than casual practice don't let it replace live pitching . fun-factor 5 , but far training device , i question its value	-1

i would not recommend this product unless you absolutely cannot afford spend any more money . around $60 , you could get " world industries m.a.d. balance board " get much better looking more durable product . or you could spend around $80 get bongo board . if you really want best money it , you could spend $120 get indo board . zoomboard i received green blue . unfortunately , it looks garish , but child may like look this . addition garish coloring scheme , board rough sandy underside . this good because it allows board better grip rolling tube . however , after couple weeks using it ( five days each week 30 minute sessions my 140 lbs . frame ) , tube develops craters sand wears down . then again , if you wait it out , sand eventually slough off board itself you won't worry wearing down your rolling tube . but gripping surface compromised . if you try using this hard floor not carpeting , rolling tube starts move less fluidly than before . make sure there no grains , pebbles , or hard materials surface you practicing because they easily ruin your rolling tube . this may failing boards use wood rolling tube . overall , this board fun , but not great quality . if you absolutely cannot afford $10 more purchase much better product , then buy this board use it sparingly carpet get long life out it . if you afford more , keep looking check out products i mentioned above get something that'll actually worth your hard-earned money	-1
i purchased this backpack ( black ) august i haven't actually used it until december ' 06 . i carrying around 40+ pounds this pack hiking apalacian trail , first day , this pack ripped . my left shoulder strap ripped off bottom , i secure it square knot . next day right shoulder strap ripped different place , i loop adjustable strap around seam belt . also , i stepped waist belt numerous times without thinking it , flimsy peice plastic broke . it still held , but i check it twice every time . i tried pick up handle above straps my fourth day hiking , left side it ripped partially . thing happened i trying put heavy items bottom bag while hiking , when i came home , i noticed bottom bag some holes it when i leaned against rock or ground catch my breath . bottom this bag nothing but fabric . this pack nothing but glorified backpack , not meant hold anything more than 25-30 pounds most . if you want backpack dependable , buy something else . if you want something cheap day hike or something , i suppose this pack you , but i'd still say this pack not worth it .	-1

i would given this product one star , but i get several months use out it before it literally melted down into useless steaming pile plastic . after two weeks use , electronic mini-stepper started creaking groaning like it could snap any moment . previous reviewers noted , thing actually starts smelling burning oil/plastic/metal . after two months use , shocks both pedals started leaking fluid . good thing i nice thick plastic mat underneath it . i owned used electronic mini-stepper all four months , using it five days per week ( 20-25 minutes per day ) , before cable secured around pully-wheel snapped loose its moorings . this probably occured because extra strain put cable due decreased pressure defective , leaking shocks . i now own twenty pound , forty dollar door stop . there no reason , other than ultra-cheap construction , 160 pound man should able destroy piece exercise equipment like this four months . during this time , i used nothing but normal exercise practices : smooth , even , steady steps ... nothing jarring . buyer beware this one	-1
i bought one brookstone mini-exercise bikes when it still priced $99.00 ( february 1 , 2007 ) , based two positive reviews posted time . initially , i impressed prompt delivery product but immediately discovered bike not factory assembled correctly . instead left- right-hand crank arm , my exercise bike two right hand crank arms . this may seem trivial until you realize cranks suppose threaded opposite directions prevent pedals coming unscrewed during use . i contacted brookstone customer service request replacement part ( i needed two right-hand pedals ) evening i received shipment . i place follow-up calls each week six weeks until finally receiving replacement pedal . when , one point , i mentioned simply returning exercise bike , customer service rep. indicated approval would needed higher up food chain because -- i waited new part--i'd bike my possession past 30-day return policy ! new pedal finally place , i immediately tried out bike disappointed ( though , unfortunately , not surprised ) overall construction feels very flimsy under foot . mini-bike quite noisy so far , i've found no floor surface keeps it reliably stable during use -- either rug or linoleum . result , i back it up against desk , file cabinet , or bookcase use . this product huge disappointment i would strongly encourage people interested purchasing small exercise bike please not waste their money -- even reduced price -- this product .	-1

this my third heart rate monitor . i purchased this one because battery died my last hr watch . i thought i could replace battery , but when i tried replace it , i broke it . oh well . . . anyway , i purchased reebok fitness hr watch because it sale ( 50% off retail ) . i couldn't find any reviews it so i " rolled dice . " my two previous hr watches , it pretty intuitive how set operate them without reading instructions . reebok hr watch , i read instructions couple times . after couple training sessions , i began feel comfortable how operate it use its settings . there few pros reebok hr watch : ( 1 ) chest heart rate strap work precor cardio machines heart rate monitors . ( 2 ) chest heart rate strap battery easily replaced . ( i don't know watch . ) ( 3 ) it lot features you'll find higher priced hr watches . now , cons : ( 1 ) heart rate reading much too small if you're near-sighted or need reading glasses . ( 2 ) shape crystal cover causes glare under certain indoor outdoor lighting so it difficult read small heart rate reading . conclusion , because heart rate reading too small there glare , i can't read watch unless i slow down , steady my arm , position my arm certain angle deflect glare . because this , i'm disappointed this watch . if you've got good eyesight , you add 1-star	-1

during time i considering buying this model , i happen see same thing local department store ; so i bought it . i couldn't wait take it back . i wasn't impressed cheap plastic . pump came adapter pre set schrader valve ; my tires presta . blister pack says it used both indicates all one take off " round end " , remove reverse plastic adapter , re insert then screw cap [ tight per label ] . seemed simple enough , so , i took off cap , took out plastic insert [ i noticed it 2 parts ] , reversed re inserted then replaced cap . when i put end presta valve then pressed down " thumb part " , i couldn't help but notice plastic would not grab valve , but loose . so i decided change back schrader type [ use my adapter valve ]; maybe this would tighter fit . so , i took off cap , tried remove insert , but only one part it came out ; parts separated ; i could not remove " bottom " half . i not going force it out . i put parts back together , re inserted them into blister pack returned it . no thanks !!! i gave this product 1 star only because way this review process set up ; it doesn't deserve any star or any consideration purchase	-1

yes , you'll feel your muscles contracting . if they really contracting degree worthy called exercise , contractions would scare heck out you : you'd either feel like your whole core paralyzed or you'd going into spastic , involuntary crunch . don't worry , won't happen . machine isn't strong enough .

maybe s120 work you , but it nothing but trouble me . i bought it because great features price , but returned it because all problems : 1 ) manual anything but friendly , e.g. after completing 11 steps set date you then told there short cut . thanks . 2 ) after spending much more than hour manual just get basic settings , i'm off exercise . great start , reading my usual pulse around 55 , then it drops out 0 . ok , maybe contacts too dry , so i wet them . off i go again pulse rate measures 204 then 0 . ok , maybe chest strap positioned poorly . different position , same result -- measured pulse rates all over map . i decide forget what monitor records finish my exercise . final result -- i got periods reasonable heart rates , but lots time values either 0 or over 190 . next day i try again same result -- drop outs then sky high readings . it went back later day	-1
living florida i bought two these everlight flashlights . party said there enough charge during shippins little shaking head . it takes least couple minutes shaking before there even glimmer light . after if you don't continue shake it dies out very rapidly . this light may possibly come handy during hurricane power failure but there other led flashlights batteries superior this one . power used these leds low batteries last long time .	-1

now i am firm believer breakfast very important time your day . yesterday morning i driving dentist office when i realized i forgotten eat . i started quite anxiety attack , so i pulled over only available place . gas station . nothing really caught my eye something i would like put inside my body . now this no ordinary gas station . this special kind one where they hot food behind counter , including supreme-pizza , chicken drum-sticks , even breakfast-style food , like little sausage-egg-buiscuit-combo-sandwich . sure , food smelled alright , but thought sickened me one mechanics or gas-pumpers may oil , grease , or even gasoline their hands when preparing these dishes . while i peering over counter , trying scope out just how filthy their hands , something my left caught my eye . it golden box something called " powerbar " . name me sold immediately ( food creates power ) , they even individually sealed prevent repulsive hands workers contaminating them . " i'm going eat powerbar " only thought my mind i purchased 4 them spot . i hopped back my vw cabrio sped off down livernois towards dentist office . i unwrapped one powerbars . it looked just like normal candy-bar but name told different story . just how much endurance stamina would one these provide , how long ? what kind advantages would i gain ? i thought i found my new favorite food . finally , food defines howard tuttleman person . , until i took my first bite . my first bite literally took me 2 minutes chew up enough able work it down my throat . it tough rubbery nugget inside chocolate stretched out bit like taffy . every bite same grimy bitter flavor , atrocious after-taste . my mouth felt like i ingested whole bottle elmer glue , every crevice my teeth gummed up it . i reluctantly continued eat entire bar . my stomach began feel if i eaten lead . i felt no extra power my body . if anything , powerbar significantly weakened me making me feel ill . i convinced i simply picked bad powerbar , so i unwrapped one give it second chance . this time i dentist parking lot . if i went now , i could make appointment time , but i try more power . big mistake . second powerbar no different . it felt like powerbars fighting my stomach . i finished second powerbar , feeling even worse . my third powerbar however worst bunch . it different flavor , i nearly threw-up . i felt 20 pounds heavier . my teeth lips felt like i eating drywall , covered chocolate grimy nugget . i simply could not eat more than 2 bites fourth one , no matter how much i tried . it time go inside . my dentist little ticked-off i late , got really annoyed all powerbar remains stuck my teeth . apparently i wasn't supposed eat while before my appointment . i felt sick rest day . i gave my dog ( morris ) rest 4th powerbar see if it would work dog , but it just made his butt really powerful night real pain clean up after . please beware , name this product deceptive , unless it supposed mean powerbar itself powerful , overpower you . later . howardtuttleman.co	-1

we know strollers !! this our 5th stroller over 4 kids . we decided try dually . pros : plenty room 2 children both 25 pounds . " cute " cons:we're reviewing what we consider expensive stroller . our opinion added expense shouldn't equal just extra seat , but better design higher quality . 1 ) while dimensions listed description , relative size every day objects not discussed . objects , like say , doors . this stroller won't fit through 90% doors world . you basically better only expect it go through front door your house or plan parking it garage next your suburban . doorway must 3'0 door ( 36 inches wide ) . that usually only your front door . forget pushing into or out any interior doorways which generally much smaller . 2 ) straps awful . again , our 4th stroller . worse one all . incredibly , incredibly difficult use . i'm actually flabergasted how difficult straps . despite tightened them up tight possible , two year old out under 10 minutes ( once she decided out ) . 3 ) impossible allow children sit up . again , adjusting straps utmost , angle backrest remains extremly steep . perhaps counter balance lack effective straps ? 4 ) hand brake setup left hand . appears reversible if you want work it . 5 ) hood not lowered cover front children . if say , you walking into sun ( morn or evening ) , kids completely exposed . conclusion : very frustrating buy . wouldn't recommend it all	-1

i used try strengthen my fingers using gripp balls , later , gravity gripp , which grip balls also 1 pound weights . however , they bulky , hard get grip , heavy pretty silly looking . so , when i saw picture these awesome little gizmos catalog , i ordered one right away . they same price grip balls , but they so much cooler ! not only this good fitness training , they're even better musicians ! ( my instrument piano . ) these light flat they fit right into purse . i don't feel silly using this out public -- if anyone asks , i just let them try it , they immediately hooked . i carried my blue one around everywhere until this weekend , when i gave it away friend . it difficult know which tension use . i'm woman small hands , found i am right blue red . i use blue one 4th 5th finger ( left hand ) . i usually handle red one everything else , but booklet says repititions more effective than heavier tension . i use mainly blue one now . i hope work up red , but while . i'm also going buy couple more so i work both hands simultaneously . i one caveat -- make sure you use these correctly . don't overdo it , or try use heavier tension just feel all macho . like any weight training , you press buttons precisely isolate muscles . don't use your whole arm just get button pressed . i found if i started cheat , i got little wrist pain felt beginnings tendonitis . ( reason i'm staying blue tension now . ) oh , buy your gripmaster here amazon . they $15 each everywhere else	1

this flashlight simply awesome if you just little common sense . this meant emergency flashlight if you use it such , it great . this definately not spotlight type light it isn't meant . but when you need some light emergency , little shaking you some light . it starting dim ? just shake it some more voila , more light . you could lost miles anywhere you know your batteries not going go dead walk help . i don't know why people giving this bad reviews . this so easy my 6 year old niece shake it get it working . if you smart enough shake it like instructions say , light last longer then people here saying . if my 6 year old niece figure it out , i would think adults could too . but , there always going people out there who complain everything . this emergency , no battery shake flashlight . i think some people expecting flashlight would shake itself . you should keep one these flashlights your vehicles , campers , boats , kids rooms , etc . how many times you went get flashlight batteries dead you couldn't find new ones ? this one worked everytime i uesd it . but then again , i common sense . this flashlight great !	1

one weigh advantages disadvantages this product based one needs or requirements . imo , pros cons ... pros : these tabs weigh only few ounces , but treat up 20 liters . they very effective killing off viruses , bacteria , giardia , cryptosporidium(epa accepted ) . this product great if you can't build fire or boil water . cons : one tab one liter so unless you stock up , you only support one person 5 days if you use 1 gal . or 4 liters per day roughly $10 . compare this 96oz( ~ 56000 drops ) clorox $4 it only takes 16 drops treat 1gal . water . katadyn claims their tabs leave virtually no taste water , but i disagree . there very strange taste water less tolerable than chlorine imo . minimum treatment time 30 minutes both . alternative : boil water 5 minutes any desired quantity virtually no cost ! :	1

typical aegs shoot 280-310 most fields moderated 350 fps limit so 400 fps aegs great if u wanna play yourself or non official place ..... i also sure hope sniper shoot 500 they normally single shot ..... theyre not same categlory so your not comparing apples apples .... this very nice gun .... it expensive parts included functionality ... this gun defidently not beginner gun so i only reccomend it people who owned 2 or more aegs previously ( aeg-tm ics , ca , aim m4 , gp , gg , ect ...	1
i'm my 5th cap now i think . silicone great lasts forever . unlike rubber ( which snag hair ) latex ( which some people allergic ) silicone fits smoothly over wet hair , glossy finish so it looks great doesn't lose elasticity . i some advice if you want try this product i've learned overt years : 1 . always rinse hang dry . i've left wet caps my gym bag after month two neglect , it develops black spots . i don't know if it mold , it doesn't wash off ... you'll buy new cap if you don't like spotted look . 2 . pull it gently . i've ripped one when i trying stretch it over my head because my long nails cut right through it . it not cloth so you careful . this goes latex rubber , too . 3 . wet your hair first . if your hair dry when you put it , you trap air under cap . since it not permeable material , cap start come off while you swim because air trying escape inside . 4 . pick fun color . that it . great swim	1

if you aren't prepared use swing setter couple times week ca . 5-10 minutes each time , you probably won't get benefit it offer . cd literature very good job helping you define your training regimen which you need add only discipline execute it regular basis . effects it me follows : ) despite my impression my grip solid , it forced me assume stronger , more compact grip helped me my tendency fade ball ; ) it helped me revert more hitter than swinger ( which i used when i playing better ) forcing me increase speed my swing ( especially backswing ) delay release thus stopping my tendency " cast " . quality construction excellent ; i can't imagine wearing it out although , i see magnets lose strength over time . my main problem looping swing - inside outside . so far , swing setter not seem address this problem ; i still loop magnets release desired time . i would think some other " hinged " swing trainers would better help this problem . i recommend swing setter if no other reason if you discipline , it serve conditioning device use during off-season . good luck	1

it actually called tent organizer it works fantastic . just hang it any tent pole fill it up whatever you don't want ground - toilet kit , socks , towels , etc . what great idea	1
previous reviewer provided lot good information this dvd . i thought i would add few additional comments . first , you get lot bang your buck these $50 cathe dvds - they definately worth money . this dvd 3 full workouts - boot camp , muscle endurance combo ( 2 ) . there also number other options dvd menu . i workout regularly variety videos/dvds but i'm not motivated when it comes doing resitance training my own . there some light barbell work sevaral firm cross training videos but my barbells mostly collecting dust . i found cathe dvds when searching amazon . when i saw description this dvd it sounded like perfect fit equipment i but price really challenging . i decided take chance go it . needless say , i very impressed i even ordered $50 cathe dvd . if you equipment ( barbells , dumb-bells , high step/firm step maybe even medicine ball ) you enjoy hour resistance training , i would highly recommend this dvd . it challenging experienced exerciser but it easily modified fit any other experience level . there some intense ab work this dvd too . if you don't one , you might want purchase " heavy resistance theraband exercise band " $7.49 through amazon when you order this dvd . cathe uses this also standard resistance tubing/bands aren't good subsitute . although there no price difference amazon cathe website , when ordering through amazon , cathe dvds/videos shipped priority mail . cathe website usps not option so they won't ship po box . if you live outside continental us their only shipping options 1 or 2 day air so amazon significant savings shipping if you live hawaii .	1

this kit also includes speed bag !! item description never mentions . which awesome , but i already ordered one because i thought this didn't it . however it small speed bag so keep mind . bag gloves very " budget " just like they state . so i doubt they last long . heavy bag fully packed , so box 70lbs . other than this exceptionally good value esp . free shipping	1

i've spent years camping bag clothes half-strewn around my tent , so new tent led me check this out see if i stay organized . closet comes its own thin carrying case . it looks complicated first opening , but it easy insert fiberglass rods , zip down corners , adjust velcro seams , boom ! you've got very sturdy roomy set shelves socks , shorts , t-shirts , towels , medication . there zip-down mesh cover keep things out your stuff yet keep it ventilated , it rolls up out way . pockets sides pop/beer cans , wallet , like very handy , hooks keys both sides let you keep things where you find them easily . there even pocket back stores magazines maps . but value keeping things organized , off tent floor , where you see stuff without paw through duffelbag toss things all over your tent . i'm happy found this neat piece tent furniture	1

hobbyist woodworker who works primarily hand tools , i've learn how put razor edge things like plane blades chisels . while i've managed master skill ( shave hair off my arm these tools ) , putting sharp edge my kitchen knives nightmare . i've tried numerous methods , none which worked well . year ago , i puchased spyderco sharpening kit . read manual , watched dvd , put my kitchen knives it , ...... ended up pretty dull knives . frustrated , i put this kit kitchen drawer . fast-forward last week . kitchen knives dull again , none my sharpening systems work knives . so , i pulled out spyderco again gave it try . this time , i tried sharpening my serrated bread knife . after just few strokes , it good new . so , i tried it straight knives again , but only got modest increase sharpness . now convinced some my kitchen knives made inferior stainless steel , i tried sharpening my swiss army knife . again , after few stokes sharpmaker , i wicked sharp knife . i down workshop today , sharping my plane blades chisels . last plane blade sharpen scrub plane ... blade these very convex , so sharping it always challenge . fortunately , it not need super sharp , never . sharpmaker sitting out , so i said " what heck " , gave scrub plane blade few freehand strokes sharpmaker ... no sharpening jig hold blade like i normally use . fun , i tried shave hair off my arms .... it worked ! i couldn't believe it ... this sharpmaker makes sharpening too easy!it american-made , very well thought-out , works amazingly well when your blades aren't made junk steel . what more could you ask ?	1
this review nike t-90 club team ( 32 panels)i bought this ball less than $15 thinking i couldn't go wrong . i hadn't used nike balls before , so i didn't know what expect . it turns out this ball flies better , softer , rounder , better stitched than my more expensive adidas balls . great practice ball , pick-up game ball . i would no problem using it small club match either . far my $30 adidas balls ? not chance . 5 stars based performance vs . price . i hope you get good deal i ( through eastbay athletics )	1
we just got this bag today our son . we got short version this bag , but i don't see version amazon anymore . outside very nice rip-stop nylon material soft cuddly , zipper very smooth . inside little scratchy , but i am sure it better after washing . drawstring around hood pulls nice tight keep out air . only thing i disappointed color . picture amazon , box it came , turquiose . bag definitely not turquiose ! it darker blue - closer navy - color . yellow more mustard color , not bright yellow , inside dark gray . but my son likes it anyhow , course it doesn't affect quality bag . i like fact hood turns inside out , too	1
i overall very happy performance this tent price aournd $100 . it recently survived well while used over week backpacking denali national park alaska . weight slightly more than typical backpacking tents , but price features make up . it survived over 40 mph sustained winds one night no damage . two doors size decent 6 foot people without too cozy . vestibules very handy storing your boots . colder nights it get fair amount condensation inside tent though . overall good purchase .	1
we use these socks snowmobiling -20f temperatures they keep your toes getting numb when you're outdoors long stretch . note amt head batteries very small , but it enough keep your toes numbing out trails . don't get " hot " , they not made keep your feet warm inside . amount heat they produce not enought notice heated home or office . battery life high 10 hours - maybe 12 hours low setting .	1
three things consider yoga block : size , material , color . this thing purple = ugly . material foam , this block still around 1 million years after i die - more environmentally sound purchase try cork , double price , course . finally , i like size this block , most blocks 3x5x9 , this one 4x6x9 which means its more stable	1

i used this unit twice more impressed each time . first time loaner my favorite golf shop second unit i just purchased . my reaction ... wow . great tool golfers all skill levels . information presented appears extremely accurate much more accurate than guessing or finding marker then interpolating distances . i found intelligreen feature extremely useful . i able shoot several greens unseen whereas before i would laid up safe visible landing zone short green . target lists consistent features i concerned most holes . if anything , i found target list contain too many itemsi found registration set up bit tedious would like sky golf make it easier . sure read installation instructions manual very closely . your internet browser must set allow cookies sky golf . otherwise you may spend all day never get set up or able download courses . variety plans course downloads adequate , but i wish they would include least 1 year subscription basic " par " sky player course download plan purchase unit . others complained quality construction . i don't know what their standards , but my unit seems well constructed very high quality material . bottom line , if you afford it you're looking great product improve you knowledge golf courses you play ... then this product you .	1
i've doing yoga 7 years . i've gone through couple regular sticky mats now ( i don't like how they get stretchy after couple years ) , so i decided buy something more durable . i love texture this mat -- it very solid feeling good bit stick -- it doesn't move around all . it just right amount cushion it , i use it hard floor . i also bought lumi towel ( large size ) , also manduka , put mat , since my hands feet tend sweat time i get middle my routine , this make any mat slippery . i didn't any trouble coating mat -- it wore off after little bit , i used towel until it . i also didn't agree some other reviews saying it too heavy . it bit heavy , but not too much carry around all over -- i made carry handle yoga strap ( looped over both ends rolled up mat ) throw it over my shoulder	1
these mats easy use , pretty durable , but i find them too slippery . not enough friction . thin rubber surface would much better	1
these gloves extremely high quality . they great job protecting your hands , most exercises , they help your grip . best wrist support any glove i've used date . however , mentioned : if you small hands , added padding/rubber gloves decrease circumference your grip general . this problem exercises like deadlifts , chin ups , etc . also , material inside bit like felt . when your hands sweaty , these gloves basically adhere your hand inside it usually takes me 1-2 minutes get them off . they may just need broken more , but i've used them 3 weeks thus far .	1

gym very easy assemble , took me 45 minutes my own . book supplies several different workouts , hitting every major muscle group , you get good resistance every workout . you won't get great range motion all workouts , there may times when you'll need lean back or put yourself different position order get full stretch , but those minor adjustments you'd probably make any other type equipment . gym itself light , easy move around house , doesn't take up much space . it may too light , not sturdy enough some instances , you need stand frame stand-up workouts . price outstanding , 180 dollars . you're not going find better deal than this , workout very comparable far more expensive bowflex	1

i just received blackburn delphi 6.0 earlier this week , i've already put it through few rides . i'm upgrading cateye astrale 8 i've long time . i've started training heart rate monitor more seriously lately , i thought single integrated unit handle both features would great . i almost bought delphi 5.0 while ago , but decided hold out 6.0 get nifty altimeter features . here my impressions my new computer , good bad ... pros : - mounting bracket system very clever , seems better cateye bracket i used . changeble soft platic shims line bracket clamp , changing fit different handlebar diameters . 3 different thicknesses included , which chould accomodate everything skinny aerobar computer mounts oversized road handlebars . - altimeter function great . altitude measurement solid seems very accurate . percent grade reading acts sensibly , even though it lags little ( this explained manual ) . distance climbed end ride agrees very well topographic software , works far better than gps-based solution i using . - lap feature great capturing statistical snapshots particular segments your ride . big hill your route , want know how much you climbed how fast you averaged up grade ? delphi makes it really easy see those sections taken out whole . up 20 laps recorded . i think them less " laps " more " intervals " . - backlight feature very cool . i've always just without computer info night before ... but this way , i don't . i'm sure it kills batteries , but it nice . cons : - average speed algorithm seems little flaky . it seems read ay least 0.1 mph slower than one would get simply dividing distance ride time . my cateye always agreed well calculated value , but way delphi figuring average must different . this liveable , seems less problem routes without lot stopping . - max heart rate reading get ruined frequent " spikes " , so real max hr unknown . finishing ride , it possible max hr show something unrealistic like 235 , probably due signal glitch or some interference . then , you no way knowing what true value . these spikes don't affect average , however . i should mention i've seen this behavior both standalone hrms i've before ... so it not unique delphi . - cadendce sensor hard mount so magnet close enough sensor . i put magnet very close end crank , because crank arm close enough chainstay point . but mounted there , magnet covers back side pedal spindle . if you pedals which require hexkey back side remove , could problem . they could remedied making cadence magnet little thicker . comparison , my cateye crank magnet mounted middle arm no problem . - wire cadence-enabled bracket cadence sensor very long . this may good putting it out aerobars or something , i admit too long better than too short . but i foot or more extra cable try hide around my shifter cable housings , it hard tuck slack away . i large bike frame plenty tube real estate spare . - unlike my standalone hrms , delphi doesn't calculate calories used . not those numbers ever accurate anyway , but it would nice ride-to-ride comparison . general thoughtsoverall , i think it great computer . negatives above all really minor issues , i haven't found computer yet offers much such reasonable price . there lot more tell than i include review like this . i'm just trying hit big highlights ( lowlights ) . but definitely , no regrets this end buying it .	1

our very busy toddler ( 17 months old ) good time this scooter . it very well made especially reasonable price . wheels not scratch our wood floors , unlike some her other toys . she our third we our fair share similar toys . this one one better ones . only down side it could little lower ground . she above average height just reach floor well enough push her feet . our older girls petitie this would too big them recommended age 18 months . once they their twos , our girls preferred trikes , so i'm also not sure how long this last ' favorite ' , but it definately ' handed -down ' or given friends it going last years	1

i bought older model petzl e32 myolite 3 headlamp couple years ago trip grand canyon . although it works well when move , whether hiking night , or finding your way water cooler or latrine , it two drawbacks when using it fixed location : - : even when using 3-leds ( which less-bright option ) , it so bright one not easily use it reading , nor one use it ones tent without disturbing your tent-buddy . - : even when using 3-leds it so bright it difficult use it read , since it makes white page reflect back you . also , weight bit heavy one head . it these reasons i just went out bought black diamond zenix iq my upcoming trip yosemite . i playing it my apartment tonight ( lights turned off ) , i already tell this black diamond model far superior petzl i bought 2 years ago . zenix iq following features : - it much lighter more comfortable than petzel- it 6 brightness settings ( opposed petzel 2 ): it 3 settings two leds , it 3 settings ultra-bright bulb . - it multi-function colored led acts both headlamp finder middle night ( when you wake up looking your headlamp ) , battery meter warn you ahead time when your batteries starting get low	1

plastic side mounts ( 4 ) appear solid not flimsy . i replaced 12 supplied screws actual stainless steel ones , ( you know , since this going boat ! ) but least hooks attach cooler stainless . package says " includes all stainless mounting fasteners " so i guess means hooks only . supplied screws not even galvanized . so if you plan affix these mounts permanently boat , go get stainless screws also 1/2 " longer than ones provided . all all it nice kit but little pricey what you get	1

this may ' outdoorsy ' ubergeek watch . it big , it ugly , but functions make fattest swiss army knife sit corner sobbing jealousy . overall , i like it but there couple things sound better than they . timepiece : outstanding . it hh : mm :ss dd: mmm , course , year setting avoid leap year issues . this should go without saying modern digital watch . stopwatch lap function ( not i ever use lap function , but i'm sure someone interested ) . countdown timer run up 24 hour countdown ( very easy set ) . three daily alarms . special kudos alarms , this one loudest watch alarms i've heard , i've missed too many watch alarms not appreciate this . altimeter : largely eye candy , but kind neat . over four days , my bedroom went 100m above sea level 25 below sea level ( maps , 40m asl ) . not surprising because it driven barometer , i never recalibrated it , but graphic demonstration importance calibrating it when you want/need it . barometer : yup , it barometer . part i like little display shows rising/falling trend , especially this always active ( even normal ' time ' mode ) . thermometer : take watch off get accurate reading sensor too close wrist . compass : easily best ' special ' feature . accurate , precise ( enough orienteering , not surveying ) , easy use . it programmed declination , but knowing me , i'd forget reset it , so i declination hard way . sighting notches small but servicable . spirit level bubble unique among digital watch compasses suunto , greatly enhances accuracy confidence compass . outstanding wrist compass . package : big . really , really big . but controls very easy use seem fairly resistant accidental button pressing ( problem me other watches ) . battery shortish ( 12-18 month ) life , but hatch , so you don't need take it jeweller get it replaced without ruining water resistance . display large characters high contrast back ground , display light just right , readible , even , glare free , but not emergency flashlight . personally , i'm going swap resin band velcro strap , but stock strap isn't bad , just not great . overall , not watch office or suit but very good watch , compass barometer , what you could expect thermometer altimeter . well designed , thought-out , manufactured , but really big .	1

i thought dvd excellent standpoint person not much experience lifting or exercising . it shows great technique form . i used wrestler highly competitive state iowa so over years i learned many these pushup workout techniques . pushups dumbbells used my main source lifting staying shape . i found myself too advanced power 10 workout so video seemed like common knowledge . so beginners more advanced people looking great dvd focusing developing proper form technique this excellent dvd . dvd takes you through many different styles pushups showing proper form setup . it then set three style pushup show you routine live workout motion . dvd purchase i hoping find exercise program , approximately 30-45 minutes long , sets up nice workout routine people short time . i hoping video combines variety different pushups using perfect pushup into nice timed workout . workout works my chest , back , arms , abs , some cardio into nice overall workout short time . something similar tae bo style video or other timed exercise videos . power 10 workout isn't type video . it more specifically technique video one evntually combined into workout their own . i recently wrote some emails body rev president suggesting development video more advanced people provides fast , effective workout routine one could get gym , but home 30-45 minutes their perfect pushup . he seemed pretty impressed idea so hopefully bodyrev builds this dvd like they their other products .	1

led headlights getting better all time . this little guy one watt luxeon led very good power regulation . regulation means light gets most set batteries keeps light given brightness instead dimming batteries weaken . princeton tec eos three brightness settings flash mode . i actually find flash mode too slow useful bike it flashes full power but these minor nits . i'd also prefer if light used aa instead aaa cells . so i guess there two things i don't like this light . but positives far outweigh negatives . light small supposed waterproof one meter . ( i don't ride under water so i haven't tested feature ! ) it easy operate batteries easy change . light pattern seems just right my riding . i use this light my helmet but it also comes handlebar mount . i run light lowest power setting most time that fine reading my bike computer or cue sheets . middle setting better general riding , spotting road signs potholes things like . highest setting , you get brightest beam but course eats through batteries quicker . i'm pretty sure circuit this light designed willie hunt , real guru bike lighting circles . yes , i'm enough nerd i actually keep track things like . anyhow , princeton tec eos my latest favorite bike toy	1

after reading previous reviews noticed bad comments instructions , i took into considerations purchased it anyways . nobody really talkin bad board . most us urgency putting it together w/out reading instructions simply just looking drawings . you approach this one differently . i went ahead borrowed friend mine paid him cold beverages because i defintely agree you need least 2 people put this together . instructions although not detailed mention you must read entire instructions carefully assemble this item , failure so delay your assembly because you disassemble re-assemble again . finally , it took us 4 1/2 hrs complete assembly based my experience , it wasn't bad all . i only wish they added spare washers/nuts just case you lose it . once its installed , i added water it let me tell you . its supposed portable but w/ base filled , its pretty heavy . board better rebound than other cheap boards out there but its not like ones indoor gym . 50 " adequate home use , but you better apace this . base takes alot room . ability move height up/down advertised . i it one hand . very nice !!! i measured it rim floor its accurate based height you adjusted o.o ne thing i found out just now . this " slam-it " rim , you not allowed hang it or it cause you your warranty . i know because lifetime answered my question i emailed ou t.t hey not weight limits these rims so not attempt hang it . i defenitely recommend this if your shopping one .	1
i really like this mat hugger mugger . thickness really nice especially if practicing hardwood or tile floor . i actually purchased mine tj maxx $10 buck less than selling price here . color selection very nice too . my one complaint i wash it several times rid mat chemical odor . i recommend using organic soap or spray whenever washing yoga mat . this one my experience , needs washed completely dried several times it fresh scent . all all i say this fine product . however , very best mat imho ecomats which made jute plant . much more expensive than this one but well worth price	1
i'm 26 i'm blast this board ! it much more accessible than snowboarding surfing , because you just grab your board go ! i take mine local tennis court smooth surface . they recommend using small hills stuff , but honestly stopping or slowing down pretty much impossible decent incline , so i prefer stay flat land . its amazing how long you stay board without even setting foot ground ! board seems constructed fairly well . i've gotten point where i some pretty advanced turns shifting my weight effectively , its really fun trying master it . i'm curious if ripstik ( competitor board ) better constructed since its made razor , they might put more money into design . anyways , i've mine 2 months , wheels definately showing lot wear . i'll most likely replace them soon . i'm kinda happy you use any rollerblade wheels instead some proprietary wheels . enables you look good deals some wheels . i'd also look around best deals these boards . i got mine sports authority sale $80 , after seen one fao my visit las vegas $130 . so , if you're fun-loving adult who likes cool new ways moving , i'd definately recommend this ! it addicting	1

i've never fan propane stoves . they always seemed flimsy , made those toy-sized backpacking pots pans potentially dangerous - until now . after two weeks rv-ing , fold ' go become welcome addition our set up . it very sturdy seems extremely well made . wide separation two burners heavy-duty pot supports allow two large , heavy fry pans and/or stock pots one time . few stoves any kind handle simultaneous large pots . it seems very stable when set table . because it folds half becomes its own carry-case , even though it handles such large tasks , it easy carry takes up very little storage space . it also instant start feature - you just turn nob then press button that it . you're ready cook . after you're , clean up snap . unlike other stoves where you take them all apart try get nasty , spattered grease , this one pretty much all sealed - just take pot supports off , wipe off underneath , flip pot supports over store inside then fold ' go!it great get cooking moved outside rv - especially things like frying bacon or cooking anything gives off lot steam . because our meals seem entail usually one or other , we plan getting extension hose off our main propane tank run this frequently future .	1

i bought this somewhat whim because i've wanting get little more shape ( got little bit pudge going ) i realized hardest part motivating myself work out actually getting ready going out gym .. time somewhat factor well . so i ordered this few days ago because i read some reviews here it looked like price right . set it up earlier today ; quality parts basically no worse or better than i'd expected .. think it stripped down eliptical machine . setting it up fairly easy but some instructions bit unclear . threw some running sneakers got , i've got say , feel/motion this thing really strange first . unless you ballet dancer or gymnist really good balance , prepared look like idiot this thing little while because , like it name , it completely freestyle . it range motion rhythm all up you . you ever ski lift mountain urge swing your skis forward back unison just because it gives you tiny feeling thrown off balance ? you might start unintentionally doing few minutes this thing ( it actually kind fun but course , there not much workout factor doing it ) . after 10 minutes , i started get motion down . it pretty fun once i got hang it , but i agree other reviews , it make your feet sore ... might try putting some foam footplates	1

i bought this my son ( recommended his special ed teacher ) whole family using it ever since . it nice , sturdy , trampoline it not too expensive . " folding " part little disappointing which i why it not getting full stars . however , we haven't needed use feature so it wasn't important us . overall this good quality trampoline those who looking something less expensive	1

standard 5 ' bar . not sure how accurate weight . it feels more than 13 pounds , but could just me . not big deal either way	1
it works advertised . not lot say bike rack . i hardly any wobble mine , i suspect those didn't assemble theirs correctly or aren't tightening hitch pin bolt down far enough . my only complaint weight -- it uses really heavy steel tube vertical portion rack , which i don't quite understand . vertical tube lowest load , highest load hitch draw tube . but it not big deal . it just increases weight rear car needlessly	1
this item garners same complaint i aqua sphere pull buoy : it floats , functional , but nicks/gouges very easily . i try keep this away sharper objects my swim gear bag ( snorkel , fins ) , but it still gets dented , nicked , scratched , gouged . regardless , it works quite well i really like smooth underside , ribbed handholds , ample crescent base ( perfect kicking my head down into water ) . one best parts it isn't small kid kickboard , but it not huge , either . really good product overall	1

this flashlight simply awesome if you just little common sense . this meant emergency flashlight if you use it such , it great . this definately not spotlight type light it isn't meant . but when you need some light emergency , little shaking you some light . it starting dim ? just shake it some more voila , more light . you could lost miles anywhere you know your batteries not going go dead walk help . i don't know why people giving this bad reviews . this so easy my 6 year old niece shake it get it working . if you smart enough shake it like instructions say , light last longer then people here saying . if my 6 year old niece figure it out , i would think adults could too . but , there always going people out there who complain everything . this emergency , no battery shake flashlight . i think some people expecting flashlight would shake itself . you should keep one these flashlights your vehicles , campers , boats , kids rooms , etc . how many times you went get flashlight batteries dead you couldn't find new ones ? this one worked everytime i uesd it . but then again , i common sense . this flashlight great !	1

i recently purchased pair gripmaster hand finger exercisers order help build forearm strength . i unsure which tension would appropriate , i bought one each light/blue ( 5 lbs . tension ) medium/red ( 7 lbs . tension ) grips . i've them little more than week now , i just love , love , love them ! perhaps that little more enthusiasm than anyone should muster up exercise accessories , but i really enjoy grips . i leave one out my desk all times , get little work here there when i stop read document or whatnot . gripmaster exercisers different conventional grips you either work your entire hand once , or each finger individually ( great guitar players , i've heard ! ) . one side features four small levers , each its own spring , squeezed together or one time . plastic flip side molded together so you work your whole hand one unit . black rubber cushion removable , you place it either side grip . it awesome idea , allows maximum versatility ! just reference , i'm female , relatively good shape , but painfully little forearm strength ( my biceps huge years tae bo , though ! ) . 7 lb . medium/red grip do-able , but challenging . 5 lb . light/blue grip , other hand , makes much easier workout ; i oftentimes find myself squeezing it while doing other things , i only feel it after number reps . if you're female not great shape , you'll want start out light/blue grips ( or even extra light/yellow ones ) , work your way up . out-of-shape guys probably get away medium/red ones start . if you've got good hand/wrist/forearm strength , don't even both lighter tensions - skip ahead medium/red or heavy/black . although i've only owned my gripmasters week or two , can't personally vouch their durability , they seem sturdy well-crafted . my fianc brother , amateur boxer guitar player , used his years without problem , so i faith i'll squeezing these babies well into 2015 ! - kelly garbato , couch potato turned fitness fanati	1

i didn't find any fabrication problems seen other reviewers . rack seems well built sturdy , i don't see any real issues it . my only complaints would assembly instructions , which pretty vague require inordinate amount interpretation , fact hardware dimensions product don't really facilitate setting it up they've illustrated . specifically , bikes shown photos must very small , order both mounted bottom length rack . using mounting holes top section ( required if you've got two adult bikes ) require staggering brackets , opposed setting them straight horizontal line . it just bit confusing , given cost things i'm mounting it , i don't want any confusion	1

pros : - fits any bike , no crossbar adapter needed frames- folds up nicely storage- easy load/unload . 30 seconds hook rack into hitch , 30 seconds load bike rack . - can't beat price- optional extension ( sold separately ) allows carrying-up 4 bikes- light . i carry rack one hand . - low price . similar thule yakima racks nearly 3 times price . cons : - rack not extend out far enough ( least my hyundai tucson suv ) . when mounted , my bike handle bars pedals come within 2 inches my back door . i'm worried pedal could scratch my vehicle paint . i usually put sock over pedal just safe . - hooks hard adjust because release levers small tend stick . squeezing lever painful your finger . - rack several inches sway . perhaps hitch stabilizer would fix this . - i found assembly little difficult . luckily you only this once .	1

this really very good bat ... it very good control ... i tried couple others but this one best all	1
this very great racquet . i always tennis-elbow problem . not this one . not sure whether it anything advertised nano technology but frame better feedback control than most popular racquets i tried . more power even slow or medium stroke . look also great . highly recommended	1
i'm not huge outdoorsman but wanted nice everyday pocket knife . kershaw leek fits bill . i love size , long enough get your whole hand envolved task yet small enough clipped your pocket forget its there . i planning taking clip off just letting knife " float " my pocket but fell love clip . only thing better than light weight your pocket no weight your pocket . i find knife well designed i really like speed safe opening action . it solid " click " lets you know knife locked position . super sharp perfect drop point blade .	1
this great little sword . it very sharp led light bright . i keep this sword next my pillow case emergency or bad dreams . good product low price . how they sell it 5 bucks , c'mon led light probably half price already . lol	1
i love this mat . because it thickness , it really helps give me support i need enjoy yoga poses say pose without feeling if i'm hard floor ! it would nice if it available more colors other than red	1
this mat great -- it got nice padding very long . because it long , it would work great tall people and/or larger men . folds up well stores well -- wonderful	1
i expecting roll astro turf , but this turned out shorter , thick felt kind surface . mat three holes one end " sand trap " " water hazard " hole actually pictures printed inside flap box mat comes , you pop them out wedge them into foam . not sure what i expecting 16.99 , but i guess , aside looking little cheap , this work	1
very good product , especially price ( amazon lowest online price i could find ) . product delivers all advertised functionality , hip color scheme comfortable shoulder straps . zippers bit difficult when particularly when backpack cinched	1
i skeptical first but upon reading empyreal review i went ahead bought it . it provides surprisingly comfortable surface great nights sleep . i agree empyreal now dont see need buying actual bed matress quite some time . oh , maybe it just me but i didnt realize this item required batteries . inflator requires 4 batteries	1
living my own first time , i not my own bed . i decided use air mattress temporary solution while i saved up money shopped normal beds . year later , i still used this swiss air bed every night . there seemed no point buying normal bed when this one so comfortable durable . it didn't lose air , meaning i only fill it up air maybe once or twice month ( yes , month ) . it comfortable . it durable , lining this thing extremely thick . it spend several months propped against metal heater sharp edges , thing never got hole . unfortunately , after 13 months nightly use , it developed small hole one seams top mattress . i couldn't find one store , settle coleman ... which absolutely nothing like my swiss . coleman very thin lining , making me paranoid what i set next it . it loses air requires refilling everyday . it comfortable , but because it loses so much air it not firm . so now i really get real bed	1
this particular knife almost all tools one use , only missing scissors . much thinner than plastic scaled versions , alox versions very strong but not quite smooth opening due lack stainless liners . blade steel proprietary stainless holds edge pretty well easy touch up ceramic stick	1
i this thing personally i love it . while its not very pratical sword actual fighting number reasons , replicas like this aren't made anyway , but you just feel so powerful it . far weilding it , i found it not hard everyone says . i weild it pretty well although i am bigger guy . weight not 29 lbs though ... don't alarmed it more like 10 length just makes it feel really heavy	1
that one long sword ... i don't it but my friend . looks good but you really shouldn't go around swinging thing , it not like you're going expect fighting or practicing near 5'7 sword , but looks awesome , really worth money	1
i spent great deal time searching 5-bike rack . greater challenge find one i could afford . this rack fit bill . it considerably less expensive than other 5-bike racks , yet it works rather well . good points : - easily adapts various bike frame types . i carry one men frame , one old women 10-speed , women autobike , 24-inch women frame , 26-inch women mountain bike large tube design . each them fit rack without any additional parts or hardware . - solid design . it doesn't rock , sway or rattle , nor bikes . even freeway speeds , everything stays put . bad points : - less-than-easy installation . it comes bolt locking nut mounting receiver instead allowing use regular pin . hole too small pin . this supposedly make it more solid ( see good points above ) . however , i plan buying different collar-and-bolt style stabilizer , drill out hole so i use my locking pin . pulling out wrenches every time i want put rack or off my truck pain . - ok , i guess my only beef it right now . overall , you get more than you pay this rack . if you budget , i highly recommend it	1
i am satisified these gloves . however , i cut area ring finger index finger because it sewn too closely . when my hand glove area bit into my hand . i am uploading photo so see what i am talking because i may not explaining myself very well :) other than i like gloves . they smelled heavy chemicals when i got them . just fyi , you might want wash them your unimportant laundry get toxic smell out . i not wash mine . these gloves not turn my hands black . that nice . i first tried them sports authority i may not bought them . but after making small cuts gloves they perform fine	1

this mirror great ! it easy attach glasses very durable . it somewhat larger than other mirrors it provides very good field view . it very easy get used now i wouldn't ride traffic without it . one turn head i scan everything behind me - much more confidently than turning my head . mirror very durable . it fell out my pocket while attached sunglasses run over car . glasses ruined mirror unscathed i'm using it year later .	1
i took this weekend hiking/camping trip very pleased it . comfort astounded me perfectly honest . i told beforehand self-inflatable mats usually needed some help blowing up(via mouth)the first time or so because packaged so tightly period time . this true , but not problem whatsoever . it took only couple minutes it all set up it stayed full comfortable entire weekend . mat compacts fairly well definitely light enough take any hiking trip . i think it well worth money .	1

so far , two weeks handful workouts under my belt , i'm pleased xtreme 2 . unit very well built , heavy gauge steel tubing platform , cables pulley system appear very durable . it very easy adjust pulleys install/remove accessories . moving one exercise very quick once you get into routine . i'm still using basic 9-exercise routine , but book shows huge number variations exercises . this should keep me getting bored machine . i didn't like one exercises routine , finding worked same muscle group no problem . i found some exercises require you maintain somewhat difficult balancing position . i suppose this become easier my conditioning improves , again variety exercises available allow you avoid those too difficult . minor gripe some exercises bit uncomfortable . leg accessory , example , puts stress back my legs when doing extensions . padding could little softer reduce this discomfort . i've gym memberships many years prior owning xtreme 2 . this unit provides excellent workout privacy your own home . i'm sure i'll appreciate it even more january when i don't bundle up venture into 10 degree temperatures drive gym . i'll just walk down into basement shorts t-shirt get started	1
since assembling this product , we great fun playing against each other or individually . assembly instructions good up point assembling height-adjustment . it easier look picture box figure it out , rather than use instructions	1

i just opened my gazelle , after buying it myself christmas ( yes , i thought every excuse book ! ) i finally put it together my first workout ( i also bought tapes ) . i highly recommend getting tape because he teaches you all techniques time goes very quickly . i option doing 10 minutes ( beginner ) , 20 ( intermediate ) or 30 minutes ( advanced ) . i opted 20 minutes my first time it great . i really look forward doing this tomorrow ! again , tape great ( it 3-pack , i lower body workout ) because it not all just gliding back forth , tony teaches you it all different techniques !!! it also light easy fold up put away which plus . i look forward doing this tomorrow !!!!	1
i bought this because i just looking low cost machine i could use my spare time . i not looking hard-core workout machine , so gazelle edge perfect . there not any resistance , but i found if you buy some ankle weights use them while machine , it works very good . this machine perfect use while watching tv instead just sitting couch . i stress fractures running , there no impact , so this good machine get heart rate up good workout .	1
i this unit , pioneer avic-d2 headunit . i use it both xm navtraffic . i admit navtraffic incident report isn't always very up date , i really wish they would write when event occured . now it just says " accident , next quarter hour " but come back 30 minutes you still exact same message up screen . however , it much better highway information . also if highway traffic slow , you router programmed , unit ask if you wish go around traffic jam . sometimes alternative worse , because unit doesn't know " speeds " off highway , so if you choose avoid , you may get worse traffic jam . far xm , reception good , some channels times sound like 56kbps mp3 , but most time it good . also , it sometimes doesn't get artist song title information . i'm not sure if this unit fault or xm . i would definitly buy this unit again , especially navtraffic	1
no it isn't horse proof ! i think one horse thought it couple hay bales beside one ....... but i scared them off . fun ! this thing great ! after quick fold-up i started out storing it behind passenger seat but couldn't easily reach though back seat well . i optioned later store it above some added cargo straps i draped across front back sets entrance handles , sometimes provided cars , fold down aid person entering vehicle . so barely enough room top my head forget interior ceiling light , really unneeded i front map lights brighter anyway . get rainfly , it quickly placed strong rain if needed then secured better once back inside tent . when i want entertain breeze , i keep it folded inside should strong rain sneak up later wake me after peaceful driftin ' off . storage case nice now it home , but seldom used it road . separated somtimes wet/insect-filled ground great but after arriving cooler climates i debated just what i could use extra needed insulation below me , provided foam pad insert works well stability but little keep out cold . extra foam pad just seemed defeat portablilty issue , i decided just extra regular sleeping bag . current small " down " bag i using would insulate fine top it would stay fluffy , but my weight would compress " down " below me i found it little keep me warm underneath , but exceptional team-up new one insert . i yet try giant " down " bag later given me my older brother , i proceeded my journey . i should mention screening great , i doubt almost microscopic " no-seeums " could even pose problem . also i got more expensive version aluminum stucture which i would strongly advise standpoint less weight freedom possible corrosion . i even bought some pvc pipe cheap bungee cords made sort canopy using rainfly its zipper-open entrance .

i kind went overboard researching products this category . finally , i went straight person who'd first sleep it : my 21-year-old daughter . it would her bed during christmas vacation .

i am age 60 , plantar fasciitis ( foot pain ) cannot leave my disabled husband alone , so needed way exercise indoors . this 203 schwinn recumbent excellent . it clearly quality product , very quiet . seat supportive comfortable , so i not need use my hands steady myself . thus i begun doing arm lifts such while i ride , more complete workout . i am short 5 foot 2 1/2 inches , but closest seat setting , i reach pedals fine . anyone much shorter or very short legs might problems reaching . also , it not ' walk-through ' kind , so you must able lift your leg over center section use it . i wish it brighter or lighted digital readout , it would read my pulse only one hand side sensors , but those small problems . i recommend it highly would choose it again	1

i always nut buying new products when it comes basketball . i tried several basketballs when it comes higher level end balls . ncaa solution , naia rawlings leather , nba leather game , now nba composite game ball . i say when it comes grip , ncaa solution ball still tackiest basketballs , but new nba game ball much better initial grip than old leather ball . this some advantages disadvantagesgripadvantage - players smaller hands able grip this ball better . ball seems almost stick your hands whereas old leather game ball not . disadvantage - ball seems also stick backboard whereas other ball would glide off it . i find i problems bouncing ball , it not bounce properly , but this problem fixed after game playing . old leather balls took months before they lost their plastic like feel . i not feel ball gets slick when wet complaint nba players who played ball . obviously i am not caliber they , but i feel ball always constant grip whereas old leather game balls would get slick when we t.t he downside this all price . i feel 100 price tag most retailers charging this ball bit high . hopefully this ball go down price . i am hoping spalding take their cross traction technology their other composite balls way other players able take advantage new panels . panelsi really like new panels this ball . i feel bounce more consistent this new design . overalli still think i would prefer ncaa solution ball , but this ball very short life span . nba composite game ball high quality ball , but if you enjoy classic feel leather , you should buy old game balls before they entirely zone them out	1
we received this acquarium baby shower . first i concerned it going too tv-like . however , it very interactive appropriate broad range developmental levels . my daughter 8 months old still enjoys pulling lever spinning ball . far soothing instrument aid falling asleep , i can't say this provided anything like . however , often mornings she wake up play quietly 5-10 minutes	1
i love this basket . i wanted removable basket my crusier , but wicker looks best it . i like able put all my stuff basket then carry it around me . basket bigger than i thought it would , it sets up high my handlebars . because this i hard time mounting headlight , which required law ( where i live ) night	1
i this set , but not cool black color amazon . i got mine walley mart few dollars less . they sell dumbbells 24 pounds weights sixty dollars add 24 pound pack thirty . mine blue yellow so color amazon might worth spending few extra dollars . ( amazon since changed picture reflect what i color wise . ) said , i'm female , i interested bow flex 552 set until i saw it my local store . good god they huge ! i thought 220 set which i'm sure smaller but no one carried it store . since i didn't want go through hassle ship it back if i didn't like them , i passed 220 . sports blocks far smaller then bow flex set , perfect women or teens people not much space . weights themselves seem well made , my only concern changing pin changing weights . hand plastic two metal pins small knock you turn . you turn knob , pull pin out move it weight . knob what locks it place . i believe knob metal but again , it sits plastic housing ( handle ) i bad night mares it breaking while over my head . so far though they fine , just plastic makes me nervous when its holding 20 pounds over my precious skull . weights very easy change except when you try put all 48 pounds them . some reason it hard time lining up , pins plastic handle you really don't want force it . it would better charge 10 bucks make whole pin handle metal . other then , time tell how long this pin handle last . i hope gofit sells replacements it . still if your short cash but need good adjustable set , grow you , you really can't go wrong this set . i would given this set 5 if not plastic pin handle	1
i am very happy my purchase , unique way it allows you drink without raising your head . i got it mainly when i am my motorcycle	1
it nice boken , it feels nicely balanced , looks good , nice price . handle wrap main reason my purchase this item ; it keeps boken your hands even if they sweaty . i little wary wrapping come undone , so i just placed few drops super glue ends few places in-between , just make sure it stays place . it good practice sword it serves its purpose , worth buy my opinion . reviewer stated his boken broke when it struck , this may very well . however , it not because faulty craftsmanship , it because boken not meant contact . it purely device help you hone your sword handling skills without chopping off your arm , which you could real katana . if you want contact sword spar friends , i suggest getting shinai . unlike boken , shinai actually meant sparring not break under normal use	1

this fun throwback toy , but aware child you buying it should least 100 lbs order it effective . 80 lbs company recommends just little too light compress spring pogo stick . i would also recommend not using it rougher asphalt , what seems wear down tip most . using it smooth driveway concrete seems just fine , all neighborhood kids come around take turns bouncing around pogo stick . hey , its fun toy kids encourages exercise ( tried it out , it quite workout ! ) there obvious safety issues part parcel toy this nature , but not just specific this particular pogo stick , it pogo sticks general , so it somewhat unfair single out this paricular product " hazardous "	1

i switched these my continental semi-slicks after numerous punctures few near wipeouts wet corners . continentals not grip road well enough when there just thin layer water i've too many punctures . michelins , other hand , proven plenty sticky keep rubber side firmly down . puncture resistance great too , thanks protective liner . i don't think it actually kevlar ( many other brands/models ) but it fine last 1,000 miles . they very stiff bead little tough seat into tubeless-ready rims ( mavic crosslands ) but little liquid soap wiped onto bead really helps . added bonus reflective sidewall you end up presenting two huge , lighted hoops cars getting ready t-bone you night :) [ but officer , i didn't see him]great buy , you won't regret it	1
after two or three other products this type which not last , we found mini-jammer . this last one we need purchase	1

we bought these so children could something play during winter . we backed our vehicles out garage , zoom .... they off fun . box says " ages 3+ " up 55 pounds . bumper buggie looks small , but it roomy enough my 5 1/2 year old . he weighs 45 pounds 45 inches tall . he stretch his legs out car , but chooses keep his knees bent while driving . my two year old also work controls . it easy use kids complete 360 . my only complaint it little bit noisy , but no more than other battery-operated vehicles . i highly recommend this item . it so much fun ! best part there little assembly required . only thing we screw seat into car	1

excellent accessory kids ' play snow . helps them construct something they enjoy building using	1
when i bought igolf caddie i really some questions how good it would . especially since it so much cheaper than its highly advertised competitor . before buying , i checked sure courses i play most database , they all there . i problem , when i first turned unit i received error message when trying install software . i uninstalled software reinstalled it couple times but could not get unit work so i sent email technical support saturday morning . i expected reply monday afternoon . well i received response within couple hours explanation link download latest version software . i everything worked great . i used igolf caddie first time next day ( sunday ) . course i played recently swapped front nine back nine when i turned igolf caddie i noticed it still old configuration . since i could select hole independently it not much problem . when i got home sunday afternoon i emailed them let them know front back nines swapped . this sunday afternoon , they responded within hours saying problem corrected . i downloaded new setup everything worked great . since then i used igolf caddie 10 times it perfect everytime . i use ' hole marker ' feature note some ' layup ' points ' carry ' points . it performed flawlessly i believe pulled least two strokes average off each game . able see distance ' front ' , ' back ' ' center ' green i find myself making sure i carry least front green . this really helped . i'm pretty aggressive golfer nature this helps me make better course management decisions remain fairly agressive . bottom line product works great my experience their technical support nothing short remarkable . they give type support i wish i could find other companies . i'm still process marking different points some holes , but overall i'm low 80 now hoping some high 70 here pretty soon . few tips , first get yourself some rechargeable batteries since batteries go down 50% after one round . i bought nmh batteries they work great , just don't forget put switch ' rechargeable ' igolf unit . second , since i tend scratch front screen my cellphone i could see me doing same thing here , so i put piece clear shipping tape over screen then used razor knife cut around it . way i replace tape when it gets scratched without damaging screen ( i same thing my cellphone ) . bottom line , unit delivers promised i would recommend it anyone wanting improve their game	1
work out while you're sitting front television . though this piece equipment not intensive workouts , it great workout very little effort	1
i knew this scope wasn't made airsoft rifles , but i mounted this baby my utg master sniper , they seem made each other . they complement each other nicely looks , feel , operability . scope comes necessary rings , two flip up lens covers , protective lens covers ( which , unfortunately , drastically reduce visibility ) sunshade practically eliminate glare unless you're looking straight sun itself . i've used this scope every other day nearly 8 months it its job like its fresh out box . only complaint i've got mounting rings rusting , which me baffled because they haven't any contact water or any other sever element . scope itself fine though . magnification great , though detail slightly blurred high magnification . i back this one all way	1
i bought " magic circle " efforts up anty my pilates routine . i am glad i purchased it but i found dvd 2 star out 5 start rating . since i live far away pilates studio i purchased other dvds efforts learn magic circle . dvd classical pilates inc . called " complete magic cirlce mat series reformer mat workout " ( also amazon.com)taught me more circle use than dvd came it . it basic straight forward mat routine dvd but it practical i am well my way more complete pilates workout . i also use magic circle burn off extra energy while sitting i find my boyfriend picks it up uses it get few exercises every day . it used many ways but it most certainly enhances pilates work out	1

this trailer absolutely perfect my two-year-old daughter who still little young her own bike , but wants go rides mom dad . she enjoying it even fell asleep it few times . i recommend propping up pillows or towels next your child if you think he/she may fall asleep . if not , she bent over half ! i surprised i didn't really feel awkward or much extra weight behind me ( my daughter weighs least 32 lbs . ) . we live very flat area , so must help . we ordered extra coupler company dad bike , so it easy either us pull her . we recently took our bikes trailer weekend trip , i pleased see set up break down pretty simple . trailer fit trunk easily . i definitely recommend this trailer am very happy i bought it	1

schwinn 418 elliptical trainer solid well built . it operation quiet it makes exercising painless possible . it excellent value consumer elliptical machine home use . problem i assembly . instruction manual very confusing since it not clearly differentiate various sizes parts not state some parts already attached pedals not hardware packets . there two washers missing two plastic caps which not labeled determine left or right since they two different parts but looked identical . i also difficulty getting one pedal assemblies fit properly since one welded brackets misaligned . i called customer service they quickly sent me complete package hardware assure i all necessary parts . i highly recommend 418 elliptical trainer , but make sure you identify sort all parts before you begin assembly so you don't come up short .	1
we tried numerous flotation swimsuits , life jackets our 3-year-old little boy . they all huge disappointment - either his mouth under water or flotation device overpowered him , bobbing him forward or backward into water . this swim trainer swimline solved problem , it exactly what it supposed - keep child above water , either upright or swimming position . he move freely switch swimming upright floating effortlessly , never losing his balance or confidence . vest style upper body goes off very easily . we also tried similar swim trainer attached shorts , found crotch would just ride up , making it quite uncomfortable little boys . we prefer this ' vest only ' style , worn regular swim shorts . it stays him till adult takes it off . our son likes thrown up air , then splash into water - swim trainer stays him nicely , he cannot slip out it , no matter how wiggly he gets . wearing swim trainer regular shim shorts also nice when we beach or pool party - don't strip child naked when he ready get out water . he keep his swim shorts continue play dry land . it strong inner tube built-in ( not like cheap plastic rings made material like beach balls ) . you need bike pump or air compressor inflate - if you don't one , you take it gas station , use same pump you use your car tires . you cannot blow this up mouth . it truly great item , looks nice , durable , affordable most importantly , works . we very pleased .	1

i so frustrated those so called " sticky mats " skidless towels , i left everything try jade harmony mat . this product worked really well my slipping issues . when my yoga classes get really hot however , i notice i may slide little down dog but it nothing like any other mat i've tried . some people complain weight rubber mat , since it comes 3 different thicknesses . since i scoliosis want carry little possible my back , i chose get thinnest rubber mat ( 1/8 " travel mat ) . while yoga studio , i place one their common mats under my mat added cushion . i also recommend doing this since rubber mat tends dust magnet . so if floor isn't cleanest ( say if you practice gym studio ) , dust , hair fuzz tends attract ma t.t he smell harmony mat overwhelming when you first get it . it would make my entire room smell rubber when i trying air it out . smell , however , fortunately goes away over time . just make sure you air it out much possible . i've my harmony mat 10 months now i don't notice any wear it	1

i looking challenging low impact workout couldn't find one until i found low max . this great workout i raised my step 8 " i feel burn :) cathe wonderful instructor i really become addicted her workouts . my cardiovascular conditioning bumped up notch thanks all her challenging yet fun workouts . great music , great instructor	1
finally , i able try one cathe friedrich new dvds . her " low max " workout intense , but fun . i really enjoyed it burned ton calories process . this workout mostly low impact step routine intervals floor toning , but it isn't easy any means . i don't recommend it beginners or anyone two left feet ! music great , but fast tempo intense pace frustrate those new step aerobics . cathe mixes few dance moves , like mambo chacha , so choreography may require some amount practice . still , if you're up challenge looking workup serious sweat , this dvd you . :-) i plan order more dvds cathe future . she good job cueing looks great ! wow scale : 9 ( out 10)difficulty : advancedstudio setting : bit boring , but current times	1

my son his friend enjoy this scooter very much . it handles very well	1
i am 16 i tried this out park few days ago . this thing so fun ride ! it lean side side , front turns , all indenepently so you choose how much bank turn . i don't understand why this sold toys ' ' us , considering it something would appeal more adults . you get into high 30s if you found big enough hill . wheels only problem , whether cut production costs or save kids lives reducing speed , it hamper it abilities carve since they made plastic . if you really plan buy this , want it go smooth fast possible , find shop sells longboarding wheels ( prefferably sector 9 ) 70mm or above , stick them this thing it much smoother , faster , grippier ride . i suggest no one under 12 ride this down any big hills . i seriously think they would kill themselves unless supervised someone who could stop them	1

i am very pleased ease assembly quality this treadmill . it everything i hoped it would . ie : easy use , quiet yet challangeing .	1
only thing i wish this treadmill included option would allow me save my settings workout . there several pre-programmed workouts , i've tried most or all them . over time , my speed increasing , so i'm not using pre-programmed settings as-is . i typically one or more button presses each time treadmill changes part program , order increase speed where i want it . aside , however , this wonderful machine . our old treadmill finally died after 10 years or so . i hadn't really doing enough workout it . bowflex series 3 , i set treadmill program time i want start working out . doing this every day , i've started slowly lose little weight , more importantly , my hdl ( good cholesterol ) increased over past few months 38 current 54 ( goal least hdl 60 ) . i absolutely credit this machine substantial improvement my health	1
this treadmill great product -- very sturdy runs smooth . it better than treadmills i using high-priced gym where i member . only problem i encountered getting it into house -- it took 3 strong guys grunting pretty hard get it house . once inside , though , set-up easy took 30 minutes . only thing needed phillips screwdriver ( one supplied could it-but it wasn't too easy it . ) all all , i am really happy this treadmill--it well made product	1
i'm very satisfied my two " hummer " radios they very sturdy very high quality . i no issue handle feeling " like it break easily " no big issue light button either however i agree small analog tuning wheel nearly impossible read but i'm capable finding stations i listen minimal inconvenience . i didn't buy this everyday radio , only emergencies . what i particularly like radio it smaller size compared other similar wind-up radios . my wife i both small , go anywhere , fanny-pack style survival kits these radios perfect fit room spare	1
researched every trike known google , i decided buy two these my twins ' 3rd birthday presents . my deciding factors these metal frames ( most trikes now plastic lightweight ) , they low ground so balance hardly even issue , wheels proper wheels inflate not plastic . so comfort movability great . weight , size tires low profile makes tipping almost impossible . nice thing seat adjusts very easily accomodate our 5 year old who asked one his birthday . they look cool too . they need assembled but instructions good . first one took me 10 minutes second one took me 5 minutes . only negative both front wheels arrived flat so we pump them up before we could use them . not big deal given how cold it , not surprising there some flat tires	1

when buggie arrived , it didn't work . i call razor customer service dept . their service awful . senior agent very rude . i managed figure out problem my own . electrical unit not connected . once it connected , it worked fine . we two them . kids love them . they lightweight ride well carpet . overall , product good .	1
we bought these so children could something play during winter . we backed our vehicles out garage , zoom .... they off fun . box says " ages 3+ " up 55 pounds . bumper buggie looks small , but it roomy enough my 5 1/2 year old . he weighs 45 pounds 45 inches tall . he stretch his legs out car , but chooses keep his knees bent while driving . my two year old also work controls . it easy use kids complete 360 . my only complaint it little bit noisy , but no more than other battery-operated vehicles . i highly recommend this item . it so much fun ! best part there little assembly required . only thing we screw seat into car	1

i can't believe some companies charge $86 same concept . this one cost $6 ! possibly cheapest us market . performing this excercise extremely hard . i first saw this standing jackie chan movie " gorgeous " . you need strong abs chest start , plus good arms keep balance , if you want perform this level . when you start out your knees . sure wear gloves , handles stiff plastic . then try just one complete rep celebrate . if returning original position ( pinching your abs together ) hard , then try resetting yourself just concentrate going down ( stretching your back abs out ) . then next day try 2 reps . then take day off . overdoing painful next morning . i really recommend doing this excercise your first workout before working other parts your body . it would tough even hold thing together after pumping your tri/bicepts or shoulders . tip leave inch gap wheels wrapping some rope around bar make balancing act lot easier . finally , i happy say after few months doing this my knees i able start off standing position jackie chan style . i pretty strong six pack now , i take blows 10 year old . but i still nice sheet flab over my abs lack running this winter . goodluck those who dare this feat .	1
this great little device work your abs , but it not going give you six pack all itself ... you need watch your diet well . two tips : 1 . make sure you stretch before use ; especially your back shoulders , since they getting workout too . 2 . use it thick carpet or put folded towel under your knees ; you'll lot more comfortable . all all , this far superior more expensive ab devices you see late night tv	1

over last 2 years , i member 4 different gyms . i traveled lot overseas during time , so i juggled memberships quite bit ended up paying way more than i wanted . my usual trips gym took 2-4 hours including travel time , i'm pretty motivated person , but after while , it just becomes too difficult get myself gym because time money involved . after coming back recent 1 year trip overseas , i've decided look into home gyms save both money time . after extensive research , i ended up purchase conquest here amazon . some other machines i looked platinum crossbow , total gym , bandflex . after comparing all machines going local sporting store try out bowflex , i no doubt bowflex well worth money . other machines might cheaper , smaller easier assemble . but i found bowflex quality difficult match . setup : i put together machine 2 hours . all you need couple screw drivers , everything else needed package . instructions easy follow makes logical sense . however , my bowflex , like many others , arrived missing few parts . my case it just few washers couple screws , nothing critical , but such problems seemed common what i've read . operation : if you not used bowflex yet , you treat . power rods provide very smooth resistance wonderful range motion . resistance builds you flex power rods , very easy joints beginning motion , yet still provides enough break down your muscles toward end motion . dvd provides instruction basic exercises ( 15 ) , manual covers over 60 different exercises . lot them simply variations exercise , but i found myself creating new ways exercise not covered included material . weight type exercises easy change , not interfere your workout . i found this very good time saver vs waiting machines gym . size : no matter how many times you seen bowflex tv , you won't realize how big machine truly until you put it together . conquest easily 7ft tall , takes huge amount space my living room . it wheels , but you not able fit it through most doors , so think long hard before you decide which room you place it . value : i ordered here amazon because awesome discounted price they , evident fact machine sold out 2 days after i placed my order . but after using machine week , i honestly say i would gladly pay full price machine . like any other piece exercise equipment , if you make good use it , it worth every penny . i noticed this machine nearly identical more expensive sport model , but hundreds cheaper . summary : this best item i purchased 2006 , over years i always ignored bowflex tv ads considered it fad . but conquest proved its worth dozen times over last week ; once machine works better than advertised . pros : solid construction , long warranty , exercise variety , smooth motion , easy operation , great long term value . cons : setup time , size , missing partsneutral : decent resale value	1

i bought this use my mr. bento lunch kit , i'm satisfied it . spoon deep enough useful ( larger bowl than , example , average plastic spoon ) fork simply its job . knife edge useful foods already fairly tender ( ie ., tender enough cut edge metal fork ) , but limitation you only knife , not utensil hold food place ( since knife actually edge fork ) . sure pack napkin , though , since it'll need wipe when you switch spoon fork . handle bit short , which why i take off star . all all , though , it exactly what i hoping it would , i would recommend lunch kits , etc .	1

this one perfect set tools , my opinion . scissors , most people want . victorinox saw outstanding . careful , it make quick work your fingers ; it very sharp cuts aggressively . it also good opener bottle opener separate tools . victorinox opener works wonderfully , but combo tool which bottle opener rolled into one doesn't work well cans . also , opener handy little screwdriver tip which used philips screwdriver sometimes . reamer lot more handy than you would think , though not reamer . i use it change watch bandes , sharp tip reaches releases spring bars without too much fuss . most used tool me though large screwdriver tip bottle opener . one disadvantage this one it starting get bit thick carry your pocket . belt sheath would more appropriate , if you pull off without feeling too geeky . ( personally , i don't care , hehehe	1

sleep pad essential gear backpacking , especially when backpacking cold weather . when you sleep sleeping bag , your body weight compresses insulation bottom side your bag which lead hiker losing warmth ground below . sleep pad provides insulation cold ground well additional comfort hard surfaces . thermarest ridge rest sleeping pad both those jobs adequately but not exceptionally . insulation adequate job keeping one warm , but pad too thin provide much extra comfort . perhaps bit weakness terms comfort , this attributes makes pad extremely light which great when you carry it you . if your primary concern comfort , go inflatable pad . if you're more concerned weight , go this pad	1

they bit tight . i'm competitive swimmer who originally depended prescription goggles purchased taiwan , but when they broke , i went online find other options . i found these goggles , remembering generally high quality goggles speedo ( before my prescription goggles , i only wore speedo women vanquisher goggles ) , i bought these . they fit rather well , i guess only qualm i how goggles feel like they're sucking my eyeballs out . that what i mean tight ; straps fine . i haven't yet tried these pool , but what i tell now , they aren't going most confortable goggles ever . if you've tried speedo vanquisher goggles , you should know rubber lining forms little air pocket extra cushioning . these goggles , however , don't offer . they just one layer rubber which , my opinion , only helps fend off mold grew my vanquishers . bravo . if you swim lot think you get use slightly uncomfortable goggles , go this pair .	1
i've using these couple months now . they not exact match my prescription but they excellent swimming . i spoke my eye care professional them he said they great deal . if you aren't sure what strength you need ( if you astigmatism , etc ) your eye doc should able give you recommendataion doesn't always match your prescription # but work you . also , these don't leak	1

my daughter got both mozart magic cube sing me cube christmas this year , we love them both ! i am music teacher , i think these just really cool musical toys young children . sound much better than i expected , my daughter loves them both . i give this one 4 stars instead 5 only because songs kind hard sing because music little elaborate . it easier kids sing simple arrangements , cube songs lots notes ... which make them great listen , but maybe little tough child sing . not reason not buy , though ! lots fun , potential interesting toy few years .	1

i like this workout . i lot firm dvds i like you squeeze resistance training short amount time . i pair this workout cardio one or it alone lazy day . this workout not formatted like traditional firm dvds only person who look familier ali . only thing you need cords come dvd	1
these cords quick , simple eay way squeeze fitness into your daily routine . workout 30 mins simple cardio , strength training cool down . forewarned cords first , awkward use , especially leg exercises . they may seem short or not pliable but changes more you use them . they also work best running shoes because there arch keeps it sliding ... i tried routine some flat pumas practically smacked myself face because cords couldn't find grip . tina coaching clear easy .... entire routine mirror image ... so you just go wherever she ... this dvd would def work well while traveling ... this routine wont get you profusely sweating but still great buy nonetheless ..	1

i'm very hard my gear this watch withstood it all . it all features you could ask watch plus few you would never expect . large easy read numbers when your difficult situations or akward positions even while scuba diving ( note : it says not press buttons underwater , but its still readable without backlight ... usually ) great feature although it large watch , it certain style all its own . i think compass my favorite feature great while orienting yourself trail map . also great conversational piece while breaking ice board room ... " my watch helps me predict weather " :-d ... ok maybe not best thing tell your boss , but still amazing watch :-)	1

i love my fuel belt . it light flexible . if i one complaint it belt tends fit snuggly . small really small , so order up one size . velcro belt ensure snug fit . bottles tends slip your hands when you perspire , but overall it great training tool .	1

108 " hand wraps ( such everlast 4455s ) too short most people properly wrap their hands , unless they very small hands such some females or juniors . if you normal or large-size hands or use any wrapping technique uses lot cloth , like one wraps each finger , i strongly recommend going 180 " wrap such these . it may seem like long piece cloth , but you'll quickly use it up protecting your knuckles wrist . remember , don't hit punching bag or anything else without properly protecting your hands wraps gloves . these everlast wraps cheap basic protection	1
first thought , when i took it out box , how sturdy it felt . after easy instructions followed it put together flash ( not there much all ) . all fairness , i don't use counter all . i just use it timed cardio device , i am not looking numbers . i use it everyday it works . would recommend	1

i really like these gloves . they provide good protection , they go easily wrap tight . they provide faster better protection than conventional wraps . it easy learn how get them off quickly . follow instructions comes them it becomes second nature no time all . i think velco " cross wraps " back glove could designed better . they don't add lot glove support they don't connect very well . but even without them this great product i readily recommend	1

first off , let me say i little skeptical performance this set . every review i read near perfect , if not perfect . my mother $150 electric sharpener , i didn't feel $45 sharpener could good ... i got it today . my coveted wusthof blades losing their edge , suddenly they seemed less attractive . i am not pro , nor i spent significant amount time sharpening anything substancial . my knives now sharper than when i purchased them . no kidding ! i'm running around house looking things sharpen . what i tell , this almost perfect system ( what it ) . it sharpens just everything doesn't blunt end or major nick/gouge . thing i loved most control system ( which you just don't get electric sharpeners ) . you put sharp or ' dull ' edge you'd like your blade , depending task , depending what type cutting tool it . you tell it works ( any other sharpening activity ) because there less frictional noise resistance you increase amount sharpening strokes . dvd manual make learning whole process really easy if you aren't already know ... my mother $150 electric sharpener never put edge my knives or her knives like one i now . fact , i'm confident if you give me blind test ( pepsi challenge , if you ) two knives my mom sharpener spyderco , i would bet anyone i could pick spyderco every single time . stones appear very high quality , seem extremely hard . i don't foresee needing new stones quite while , but even if i , i buy them separately . i'm cutting my vegetables , almost forgot how dull most people , including myself allow their allow their knives get before sharpening them , them sharpened , or throwing them away . i wish knives really never lose their edge ( like those cheesy knife cutting infomercials ) ... but reality , unless you like throwing away money , you're gonna sharpen them sooner or later . buy this sharpener . buy this sharpener ... yourself favor .... buy this sharpener .	1

we used this first time this summer . bag held up well during 600+ miles interstate driving . it let some water through during rain , but not real bad . sure pack your items plastic bags if they're predicting rain or go more expensive waterproof thule bags . this much more convenient than big plastic cargo boxes since it folds up so small , goes it own carry bag , fits closet shelf . it also goes vehicle quickly four straps . very easy use	1
i bought this 2-man tent use while backpacking . it sets up hurry , very durable , very light 2-man tent . i generally backpack one my kids , this hold two us , plus change clothes our small gear no problem . there two doors , which great , so we don't climb over each other get out tent . outside each door small vestibule , which great place put your shoes keep them dry . tent poles ( 2 ) aluminum , they very strong light . i also like fact this tent free standing . once you get it set up , you move it around easily if you're not happy location . this great backpacking tent money . it hold two people just few things comfortably , or one person all your gear comfortably . there lighter tents out there , but you'll pay them	1

pros : reliable floor pump features frame pump size , hose relieves stem snappingcons : potential over pressure due ease use ( but hurt me this one)this thanksgiving i rode 75 miles relatives . six flats later four stops filing slow leakers , i only hour late . topeak road morph only reason i made it all . i tried tested almost all small frame pumps market . some don't work all when you need them some best snapping stems . few get high pressure tire . topeak road morph clearly winner my book . topeak rm perfect blend floor pump light frame pump . where i ride i reliability good pump topeak rm only one i use . tip : before your next long distance or solo ride , get topeak rm . if you don't get one christmas , go buy one . you thank your lucky stars when it performs when you need it	1

i bought this little tyke my little brother christmas he loves it . it glock 26 compact design allows easy use people smaller hands , which case my little brother , not so much my case since i'm over 6'5 . red dot top , most part , pure asthetics although it tweaked fairly accurate up 30 feet ( common effective/accurate range airsoft pistols imo ) although it fps not entirely impression . don't get me wrong , it'll still get your attention if you get hit but it range limited compared others . silencer/supressor pure asthetics but it actually serves stabilizer/rifling rounds . i tried 10 shots supressor off found i more accurate it ; could personal preference or not but it worth exploring . magazine capacity , most state regulations real sidearms place it 10 rounds so this actually serves two purposes . ) it promotes accuracy making-them-count shots opposed random rambo shooting many weekend warriors adhere ) allows adults teach novices children firearm safety . i would recomend using this airsoft pistol trainer children hoping use real firearms , especially parents . it breaking easily , my little brother takes it out , bashes it around shoots it frequently so far , no problems . perhaps i'm just extremely lucky . few words caution though ; not go rambo this keep shooting shooting . all firearms , not just airsoft , limits how much strain internal mechanisms take . if you continually shoot it without stopping don't surprised if internal parts break . make your shots count , concise . if you want airsoft handgun better continuous firing rate , get co2 powered sidearm but ready shell out more coin . all all , dandy weapon price but if you want quality , ready get what you pay	1

this basketball goal good value money . it sturdy relatively easy put together ( my wife it under 2 hours , though i should mention she mechanically inclined ) . nothing base , i carry it . it also wheels base portability . i filled base up hose anchor it . it very easy fill hose . so far , goal stood up well some rough play , including lots dunks . here three negatives : 1 ) backboard little small . 2 ) mentioned product description , base takes up lot area . there no getting around this . it tradeoff making it portable . 3 ) even lowest setting ( 7 ft ) , it too high my 7-year old daughter ( even one smaller basketballs ) . it takes almost all her strength make basket . i plan get around height problem getting soccer ball or something lighter her shoot . she not very strong so if you strong 7-year old , it should fine . if i it over again , i would probably get one cheaper , smaller goals , but this one made well enough so it still around when my daughter strong enough easily shoot 7 ft . goal	1

i bought this trainer use indoors during san francisco rainy winter season . i thought it might nice just mount my own bike rather than driving gym somewhere paying membership fees , waiting available spincycle , etc . i am most impressed quality construction ease use . it even comes it own skewer so i don't scuff up my expensive skewer during mounting process . it very attractive , very well made , seems work great after first one-hour test ride least . i bought fron t-t ire leveling block well combination makes very stable platform which ride my own bike my own room while watching movie , reading , or listening music . what could better , all measly 80 bucks . i regular rear road tire contacts resistance roller noise factor quite low - nothing should disturb anyone my opinion . only improvement i could suggest would one or two more levels resistance - this unit set highest level doesn't really give resistance close what you would get climbing hill , but i got good heart rate going dripping sweat . it certainly get me through those rainy days where i simply wouldn't get my bike out road . 80 bucks i am highly pleased .	1

we found this light very good quality . when purchasing , we also considered similar light black decker . this light seemed sturdier tighter construction . we bought locally , so we option testing these store , before we bought ( they all come packages which allow crank free , so you try them . both models , we discovered some work better than others . what i mean some bd work better than other bd some iluminators work better than others . this may due way they treated store - some used over over again before purchase . it took while , but we found one held charge long time . fact , when i charged it home , it lasted bright light ( three leds ) 1.5 hours kept emitting dim light 12 hours . one bd we purchased ( returned ) stayed only 10 seconds after charged two munutes ( not useful ) . advice : these internet-ordered probably more likely free in-store over-use ( repeat - probably ) . however , you also can't try them before buying . so , like many things you'll need weigh those pros cons . if you get good one , you'll probably agree it very good little flashlight	1
if you find better scope 14 dollars , let me know . this scope amazing super easy fine tune . if you're tight budget , or if you just want good scope , this it . warning : you need buy scope rings mount it	1
if you into your outdoor lifestyle , enjoy getting away few days into bush , igloo cooler box much needed necessity . i used them zambezi valley zimbabwe , they performed brilliantly , keeping ice intact several days , despite temperatures shade over 40 deg cent . work very well dry ice , recommend putting wet towel over coolerbox wetting this regularly , assist keeping temp down . end day , you cant go wrong good kit , well worth every cent paid !!	1

this alarm higher quality ( but more expensive ) than most other small battery-operated apartment/home burglary alarms , sense movement quite well . me , it big plus not only it loud audible alarm when tripped , but also small strobe-like pulsing light , well ability turn unit off single ( included ) remote control ( fyi : fact , remote only way unit * * turned or off ) . it also looks somewhat imposing , if it part " real " , hard-core wired alarm system . only slightly negative issue remote control only works range five feet ( alarm motion sensing capability , however , far longer than -- but this not problem because alarm delayed 12 seconds allow you get close enough turn unit off before alarm/strobe activates ) . you may also want purchase remote ( which amazon also sells ) if you spouse or child .	1
it common scenario . you haven't taken your raft out year or more because you've just too busy bothered it . finally , you're camping lake weekend you excitedly bring your raft out . it great last time you inflated it , so there should no problems , right ? you get lake , bring out your boat , pump it up real tight . you place it water go . ten minutes out , your raft isn't quite solid , but you dismiss it cold water causing air inside slow down - lower pressure . ten minutes your raft practically bending half . seahawk 200 not give you this problem . pvc clearly sturdier than typical cheap raft . $25 cheap two person raft . i don't get raft out often , but five years , it always reliable . you won't fit two large people it , but my wife i fit okay . only downside pump . it sucks . it too little take while fill up . get either big foot pump or electric one you'll much happier .	1

i used sky caddie several different courses found it exactly advertised . its great knowing exactly where you course well situational awareness fairway boundaries obstacles . my game continues improve i depend my sky caddie ... wish i bought it sooner	1
other reviewer said , don't expect this perfectly round , if you want one those get one balanced not leather . i prefer this over plastic or rubber because it doesn't slip when you sweating . only downfall i would note stitching not leather , it rigid plastic . not big deal , but i caught it just right before it scratch . overall it great workouts working muscles hard get typical free weights . most places this much more money or really unreasonable shipping	1
battery keeps charge very long . it very cute great quality ! thanks !	1
everlast family training set so usefull . but there sth which i dont like . boxing gloves so small . anyway i like it	1
i understand disappointment other reviewers , but coaster brakes makes use reverse tantion chain , which impossible transmission using derailleur mechanism . this first one my list planned purchase my daughter turninig 8 . don't it , so ca't really rate it , but looks like good choice . 20 inch model rarely comes transmission . i re-rate it when i get it	1
i practicing power yoga 4-5 times per week over year . after mats repeatedly wore out me , my instructor recommended manduka mat . she using hers over 2 years it still looks like new . it took few weeks coating ( makes it little slippery first ) scent dissipate , but after initial break-in period , this mat stood up lots wear . i love it so much i bought one my husband one my mom . manduka mat provides great traction . i am able hold balance poses easily my mat ( something i found more difficult softer mats ) . it amazingly durable ( no nicks or scratches after few months use ) . size ... i love it . i am 5'9 " i like deep warrior pose - this mat , i don't worry going over edge . my 6 ' husband agrees . caution - this mat little larger heavier than most found gym or sporting-goods store , so if looking mat bag , test out size strength bag mat before purchasing one .	1
perfect yoga mat . some cushioning , but not too much . but heavy side if you wanting take it somewhere	1
i am very pleased this floor , although suprised how light it . i expecting more rubber material , but this much more cushion . it seems very durable though	1

i am 60 years old lady probably average technical understanding . advertisement bike said " minor assembly required " . but it turned out assembly somewhat challenge , not only me but also my husband ! we only learned owner manual following tools required : - philips head screw driver- 4mm , 5mm , 6mm 8mm allen keys- adjustable wrench or 9mm , 10mm , 14mm $ 15mm open box end wrenches- pair pliers cable cutting ability . we not all those tools house i go out borrow friends . it would helpful if required tools already included package . addition , owner manual covers many different types bikes it not always easy find paragraphs relevant assembly this particular bike . it took me two days finally get everything together ! other than , this china made bike coaster brakes comfortable sturdy i now ride it happily around neigborhood .	1
love these gloves . use them mountain biking wrist support palm padding . also , use them floor workouts support when bearing weight hands . course , always use them weight lifting -- easy adjust stiffness . i bought two sets birthday gifts . very well made . very good experience vendor	1
harbinger makes great weight lifting glove . my last pair ( harbinger 130 ) endured three years 5 day week heavy lifting ( ok , heavy subjective but 315lb shrug good glove test ) . i replaced black gel-padded harbingers these am ambivalent improvements . first , i not see whole lot merit encasing back hand leather , especially since back only single-stitched . flexible fabric cheaper gloves worked fine wasn't subject loose threads . secondly , rubber pads never going flexible gel pads . perhaps if i pressing 450 instead half , then it might make big difference , but then , i seen guys get weight barehanded well . one serious advantage these gloves over less expensive ones finger tip leather goes all way end triple-stitched reinforcement . my fingers eventually cut crescents out unreinforced finger-ends 130s .	1
i recently got anakin skywalker , darth vader fx saber . they both great . they light up great , look even better camera ! highly recommended	1

razor a3 very good kid scooter . it pretty well built ( see below ) , solid , easy use , easy learn . our son loves it ! it little bit hard close ( but that not bad thing really ) . almost immediately , piece plastic wraps around front bed come loose . it doesn't seem much function other than cosmetic , but still shouldn't happen gives impression less than excellent craftsmanship . $44 scooter , i can't complain too much . i'd recommend this scooter : we'd buy it again would recommend others	1
this bike smooth riding packs great features . shifting easier than any other bike i ridden . only downside i think seat bit hard , but upgrade takes care	1
i really like this piece equipment . instructions setup easy follow assembly simple . there no damaged pieces . it very sturdy looks like it last years . i get great workout my abdominal muscles - i think its easier than doing situps because your legs held place supports , plus you working out more muscles hyperextending abdominals . i don't use it much extending back but similarly easy use . first time i used it my torso sore few days , now i am using it almost every day seeing results just few weeks . its not too big room leave it corner my bedroom so i use it quickly morning or evening	1

this seems , me , very high-security lock . i bought it protect my new bike , after my previous bike stolen thieves who cut through onguard rottweiler armored cable lock . i don't think onguard beast could cut hand tools . shackle lock such tight fit chain it leaves no room pry bars pull it apart . however , this heaviest bike lock i've every seen . typical u-lock weighs less than three pounds . ( kryptonite new york u-lock just under four . ) beast 5017 weighs almost ten , more than even kryptonite new york fahgettaboudit chain , which it resembles . you'll some way carrying it . i don't think you simply wrap such bulky , heavy chain around your seat post , though i ride recumbent say sure . if you expect put it messenger bag or backpack , put ten pounds rocks your bag ride around bit before purchasing this lock . i suspect only good way carry it strap it down rack . also , beast two-piece padlock inconvenient . when you unlock it , shackle pulls all way out separates . usually it falls onto ground . when locking it , you assemble chain , shackle , lock hold them together ( all while keeping bike place ) while you turn key . onguard could made this more convenient padlock automatically lock when you pushed shackle . onguard supposedly offers anti-theft warranty lock , though warranty came mine said " void out state new york " . like most lock warranties , you can't make claim without evidence ( damaged lock ) someone cut through it hand tools . pros : extremely securemore flexible than u-lockcons : very heavydifficult carry bikea bit clumsy userecommendation : i would recommend good u-lock riders bikes use one . get onguard beast only if you need super-high security or bike won't work standard u-lock	1

_i collected swords , both eastern western , over 30 years now , i finally bought this model out curiosity . it far better both quality design than i expected . this good quality blade . steel good , rigid , stainless variety seems hold its edge . you could chop through fence pole it it would not fold up you . _while this not full-length katana , it good useable length use tight quarters- it also easily drawable your back without hanging up sheath . hilt covered wrapped nylon over plastic , course since tang one piece blade there nothing separate . i find overall look clean modern- not cheap . flat black finish not catch light . there elegant simplicity this tool . _the sheath especially nice- it mount your back or your hip . it solid constuction not pierce or pull off first time it snags branch or fence . nylon , it not rot or rust- like sword itself . _there some cheaper knock-offs this blade market even less , but you much better off stick proven quality united cutlery . _a sword either tool ill-omen , or spiritual symbol , depending inner development its wielder ....	1
it great value . i used it 2 months ( 3 times week , 30 min each ) i start seeing results ( not spectacular , but you tell there difference ! ) . only downsides pieces . there not last long . good thing it comes ( 3 months ) warranty co . shipped replacements very fast . i really recommend it if you want excercise without spending lots money . i am very very happy it	1
i little worried when i got this machine becvause low price , but it excellent piece equipmen t.t he machine very easy put together , you keep track how many calories you burn . it easy change your resistance level , machine timer stop if your form not correct . oar design ( versus one bar design most machines ) works more muscles your arms chest . i also find it great stress reliever . it may sound cheesy , but sometimes i like put music , close my eyes imagine i am rowing lake . it very relaxing . i wish there way track distance mile however , if you start going it really fast you start hear strange sounds , so i think moderate exercise best this machine . also , someone who very overweight or tall it may akward get into feet stirrups or seat . i am 155lb woman , my butt covers whole seat , so seat may not wide enough someone much heavier . all all , it great machine light or moderate exerciser	1

i gave this product 2 stars because assembly mess . however when you eventually get it put together it look pretty good very functional money . it worst assembly directions i ever seen any product . parts not clearly labeled all , you left guessing which screw supposed go where . last step i dont know if parts missing or not but they talking screws when you only 3 screws choose ( , , ) which i said not clearly labeled all you need figure out which screw which letter . i fancy myself fairly handy around house this not easy put together all . very frustrating . if you able decipher instructions , you need stray them if you want put it together , it look pretty good . it hold 2 bags 4 shelves shoes or equipment , but not sure if it would hold extra large pro style bags . not sure if money saved worth hassle putting it together .	-1

i bought this towel two week trip back-packing through france switzerland . towel very absorbant ( including towel-drying my long hair ) dries very fast , maybe hour or so . definitely buy xl if it your primary towel showering , it not very big . it also resists smelling if you pack it away right after showering , i leave it wet my suitcase 2 days it not musty odor when i took it out . it feels kind like paper , but soft , better than some more felt-like material travel towels not absorb well ( like one my boyfriend bought this same trip ) . i recommend this towel any my friends family traveling excurions	1
i doing gentle aerobic exercise twice week now three months hour each time , mostly stationary bike . i could only ten minutes lower body workout this set , without weights . i only five minutes abs workout . i honestly thought i better shape than this . this one dvd separate workouts upper body , lower body , abs , or it also workout combines all three . i torn getting either this or transfirmer set which more than double price this . i decided this since i not sure i would like these workouts although very old set i called firm parts excellent . i decided this because i wanted six inch step years since i remember how effective it firming up my rear thighs when i used take step class . i also could not , after much thought , figure out how slanted step transfimer would any benefit . it seemed like gimmick sell more stuff me . i always buy more dvd if i want use these steps them , without special slanted step . if you've exercising while getting your heart rate up several times week least six months you might able get through entire workout first time . if you over 45 like i am , unless you exceptionaly good condition , you might feel discouraged when you watch this . steps come this nice but they really only lower body , even though they try incorporate them into other routines , like you rest your heels them when you lie your back ab work . i know past experience nothing tone your lower body like step workouts ( except running ) this one pretty good , although they go fast constantly changing up moves , which confusing when you start out . it take me ten sessions until i am able keep up continuous changes they but this normal any step class . this helps keep it too boring . it might least fifteen sessions each workout until i able get through entire workout . time i should looking good though . i intend try tough this out until i get through entire workout . it killer stuff . people addicted firm workouts . they loyal following . i earliest firm vhs tapes i found second hand store . set called firm parts i like it better than this since it more beginner friendly . i also get kick out how they tried make it look sexy , like they when this released early seventies . those girls incredible looking . i've seen if sale ebay . this more intermediate advanced exercisers , them it should perfect . but if you determined sort like me you might able just few minutes time each workout until you good enough shape get through whole thing . time you most definitely see very visable results .	1

i've never pilates , but i yoga , i chose pilates mat because they generally bit thicker , this one because i've good luck hugger mugger brand past , because i like color . yes , some people shop things based color . sue me . anyway , mat great ! i really like extra thickness , because i often joint problems , so some poses get uncomfortable awful quick if using regular-thickness yoga ma t.t he only ' problem ' i it it bit slick . i told my yoga instructor this common pilates mats . yoga mats generally just bit sticky , this one bit , but not near much gripping feel . i also told you use window cleaner or surface cleaner your mat make it bit more sticky . i would recommend not using mrs. meyers clean day surface cleaner . i . it left residue took quite bit rinsing get off . it didn't hurt mat irrevocably , however , so i'm willing bet window cleaner or surface cleaner wouldn't hurt your mat , either . i probably try window cleaner eventually , but only when i time rinse it while if things go awry	1

i used this cap almost daily over year . it still fits snugly very comfortable . writing this review made me think order one now , inevitable day my old one wears out . i rather large head found many caps didn't fit comfortably . this one very elastic great	1
i'm my 5th cap now i think . silicone great lasts forever . unlike rubber ( which snag hair ) latex ( which some people allergic ) silicone fits smoothly over wet hair , glossy finish so it looks great doesn't lose elasticity . i some advice if you want try this product i've learned overt years : 1 . always rinse hang dry . i've left wet caps my gym bag after month two neglect , it develops black spots . i don't know if it mold , it doesn't wash off ... you'll buy new cap if you don't like spotted look . 2 . pull it gently . i've ripped one when i trying stretch it over my head because my long nails cut right through it . it not cloth so you careful . this goes latex rubber , too . 3 . wet your hair first . if your hair dry when you put it , you trap air under cap . since it not permeable material , cap start come off while you swim because air trying escape inside . 4 . pick fun color . that it . great swim	1

led headlights getting better all time . this little guy one watt luxeon led very good power regulation . regulation means light gets most set batteries keeps light given brightness instead dimming batteries weaken . princeton tec eos three brightness settings flash mode . i actually find flash mode too slow useful bike it flashes full power but these minor nits . i'd also prefer if light used aa instead aaa cells . so i guess there two things i don't like this light . but positives far outweigh negatives . light small supposed waterproof one meter . ( i don't ride under water so i haven't tested feature ! ) it easy operate batteries easy change . light pattern seems just right my riding . i use this light my helmet but it also comes handlebar mount . i run light lowest power setting most time that fine reading my bike computer or cue sheets . middle setting better general riding , spotting road signs potholes things like . highest setting , you get brightest beam but course eats through batteries quicker . i'm pretty sure circuit this light designed willie hunt , real guru bike lighting circles . yes , i'm enough nerd i actually keep track things like . anyhow , princeton tec eos my latest favorite bike toy	1

sporttube met all my expectations . i needed one would hold 2 pairs skis poles , which it beautifully . add wheels easy rolling , best all , fact tube length adjusted so it accommodate whatever length skie one . this especially great , now ski lengths sized so much smaller than past , typical ski bag would over 12 " wasted bag end my 163cm skis . after 2 ski trips it , it shows no damage , appears pretty " bullet-proof " . skitube really consists two pvc/plastic tubes , one slightly smaller diameter than other slide , one inside other . it built-in handle quite long , facilitate easy gripping lifting/pulling . it tsa acceptable closure/lock , also accommodate various keyed or combination locks ( not included ) . skitube comes shoulder strap attached handle , but i found skitube bit cumbersome carry ( although no moreso than regular ski bag ) . optional handle attach end tube facilitate pulling offered option , but i not get this so far , not wanted it either . only drawback skitube , since it rigid , it can't folded up like regular ski bag , so takes up quite bit space . however , dealing storage issue insignificant , compared security , protection , ease transport it offers .	1

i agree above post concering above-par flavors these protein mixes . my favorite banana cream pudding . regarding chocolate fudge pudding ( cfp ) flavor : i am currently using this flavor i would definitely recommend using milk instead water . usually protein mixes you decide whether use milk or water ( except fruit punch-ish flavor i suppose , because would weird .. ) but when i take cfp water it just doesnt seem blend well . i also don't get full " pudding " experience i milk , but i guess that expected . like previous review pointed out , they blend well spoon . stirring insane rate make sure clumps don't develop isn't necessary any bsn protein/mix lines ( syntha-6 , true-mass , ldp )	1

price , this light hard beat . over years , i used approximately twenty different bicycle lights brands such cateye , cygolite planet bike . while some these significantly better than bell , they also three ten times expensive . if you don't mind large mass four aa batteries your handlebars under twenty dollars spend , bell night trail bicycle light way go . real downside batteries enclosure hazard created when housing becomes dislodged during impact . while this not happened bell light , it occur planet bike light while riding through traffic nyc . distraction extremely dangerous . losing half batteries not fun either . fortunately , bell light sturdy enclosure where top half slides backwards open . this makes it almost impervious front vertical impacts . however , internal latches never quite give you clear indication it closed . rather , you must squeeze top downward push forward simultaneously until you can't move it further . much like headlight , taillight compares well more expensive lights . similar competing products , it various blinking modes well always-on setting . due design lens , light escapes sides top light . such side lighting crucial riding urban areas . build quality good but not par $100+ lighting systems . but again , selling point this light overall value . some nicer features include bright xenon bulb paired miserly led lights blink hours . unlike some mr11-based bulbs ( parabolic track lighting bulbs ) , lens assembly two ports right left sides . this spreads light perpendicularly path travel , which nice feature when traffic . these features combined very modest price make this light excellent choice budget conscious . prosvaluebrightnesscombination led xenon modesdecent build qualityside lighting headlightconsquestionable design battery compartment ( top half headlight)bulkyleds could brighter	1

previous review absolultely correct weights . if you don't weights legs stand it , fact fly your basement . i'd also recommend double-ended bag ( i.e. , d-ring bottom bag ) . it decreases bag-sway . i'm just using 2 bungee cords tie it down stand but seems work out pretty well ( instead proper shock cord ) . very helpful practicing kicks . top weights , i've also added 2 40-lb bags water-softening salt front-legs even more stability . there nothing special kind salt , i just happened them around . it looks little rube goldberg , but price i'm willing live i t.t he speed-bag stand nice . loud , but nice .	1

we ordered these skates my 5 year old daughter , who discovered roller skating . these skates great kids who just starting , well kids who mastered balance but still learning basics . we let her use them rink setting , but i believe they would ok regular outdoor use also . wheels not turn freely , so she skate not all over place . i don't know if they adjusted allow easier turning future . make skate very well , seems very sturdy product . we ordered 1 1/2 sizes too big give her growing room , pair thicker socks , she no problems ! very reasonably priced , especially since her feet growing won't this size great length time ~	1
i'm runner my schedule forces me run mostly night work days . large part my nightly run unlighted streets . i needed light see help seen . i tried carrying small flashlight but found it pain .... wrist ! i run hot never wear hat winter , even though i live montana , so i hesitant try it due increased sweat factor potential fogging up my glasses . i got one christmas gift . ( if i hated it , i wouldn't out bucks ! ) it wonderful ! it so light i don't notice it there . stap quite adjustable so person make it tight or loose one wants . it easily adjusted bare head , over hat or even over bike helmet . unlike many other brands , this light also adjustable up down . 3 different light level settings each hyperbright superbright led make it quite adaptable different needs . i've found hyperbright medium setting works best me even remote unlighted areas . colored light battery life indicator ensures i don't run out power middle run or change batteries prematurely . ability see avoid road hazards greatly improves enjoyment my night runs . when i first started using it , i planned switching light off lighted streets extend battery life . i soon discovered number cars ( inadvertently or not)swerving me decreasing tremendously well number courteous drivers moving over safer distance increasing when i kept light lighted areas . i highly recommend zenix iq ! cons : on/off button impossible me use when wearing gloves . just like any other battery powered device i've ever owned , batteries don't last nearly long owner manual suggests . low temperatures really zap battery life but expected . luckily , aa batteries inexpensive	1

gerber folding shovel really top notch . its quality construction much like any other gerber/fiskars equipment i've owned - it doesn't disappoin t.t he shovel i actually little more agressively pointed than pictures , so i'm not sure if gerber addressed this issue or if pictures off . top handle high density polycarbonate plastic horizontal design like spade should . you still use verticle part steel handle if you wish , but there isn't much it . plastic absorb some shock compared steel-only , it won't freeze your hands , etc . polycarb handle folds down itself , so it actually 3 segments ( instead several designs which 2 segments ) . this means you stow shovel included cordura nylon belt pouch which no bigger than shovel head itself . handle pivot point locks since it square , doesn't rotate or twist easily . steel which connects blade handle fits nicely inside angle cutout handle , so when collapsed it really thin . blade high quality steel hinged handle connected top . this limit depth shovel little , but i don't believe it much factor , except maybe really solid soil where you lose little verticle travel when ground butts up against hinge . it very compact , light , comes solid belt sheath ( easily convertible pack carry ) stows away easily since it so thin . i put it side pockets my doors or very small space above my rear wheel well without any problems ( trailblazer 4x4 ) . i really find no fault this item , it delivers all fronts : usability , quality , compact storage , rugged design . i almost certainly keeping one both cars my 72 hour survival kit . they even reasonably priced . 5 stars	1

this product needs some work . buttons too close together ( no , i don't fat fingers ) - it very easy push wrong one . which might just take you into complex menu that not easy get out ! pixels display ridiculously large - i purposefully blur my eyes decipher numbers . it kind seems like someone invention prototype they fashioned their garage . stitching partially unraveled ( this what " stitching may vary " means ? it wasn't colored stitching .... ) velcro strap used hold thumb sensor . yet i still optimistic ! i glued velcro strap , got used buttons display , i actually loved it first dozen uses or so . then it stopped working ... every time main part ( wraps around your hand ) moved even minutest way , unit would somehow reset itself , display boldly announcing product name then informing me all its stored information reset . i so sad ! so much so , i bought one , thinking i'd just ended up dud . but 2nd one also stopped working after only few uses . it just suddenly displayed 3 vertical lines , wouldn't turn off . only thing ever worked well this thing actual heart rate sensor , which i found quite accurate . luckily , amazon giving me full refund both , one which bit past their 30 day limit . thank you amazon ! i'm going try mark fitness one . it looks like actual company made it instead some incompetent electrical engineer wannabe .	-1

i'm my 5th cap now i think . silicone great lasts forever . unlike rubber ( which snag hair ) latex ( which some people allergic ) silicone fits smoothly over wet hair , glossy finish so it looks great doesn't lose elasticity . i some advice if you want try this product i've learned overt years : 1 . always rinse hang dry . i've left wet caps my gym bag after month two neglect , it develops black spots . i don't know if it mold , it doesn't wash off ... you'll buy new cap if you don't like spotted look . 2 . pull it gently . i've ripped one when i trying stretch it over my head because my long nails cut right through it . it not cloth so you careful . this goes latex rubber , too . 3 . wet your hair first . if your hair dry when you put it , you trap air under cap . since it not permeable material , cap start come off while you swim because air trying escape inside . 4 . pick fun color . that it . great swim	1

i got my first vector three years ago , rei . yes , it large . not problem me i am large . i am my third vector ; first two , some strange reason , leaked water , first during incredible monsoon rainstorm mountains arizona , second while taking shower . no , i not submerse watch , nor push any buttons while water ' ' . fortunately , rei accepts returns no questions . it testament how nice this watch i continued replace watch . perhaps i models bad production run , my present vector lasted over two years nary leak . good : i found digital compass very accurate useful . remember it must calibrated time time , don't forget declination . barometer very useful . barometer function constantly operating , accounts nice little symbol upper left display showing pressure trends over past few hours . this very useful if you understand barometric pressure trends their likely results . if you not , look it up learn , you find it very useful if you spend lot time brush . remember barometric pressure must calibrated against absolute sea-level readings time time , especially during rapidly changing weather conditions . once you understand relationship altitude/changing weather , you master complexities both barometer altimeter , understand just how simple they , how reliable this device really . i checked it against my high-end gps other barometers many times , it very accurate indeed . temp useful if you need know temperature ; like all such devices , it taken off your body ten minutes before you get accurate reading . bad : lens plastic . if you any experience fine coated-glass , you fine this : not , ever , wipe any dust or dirt off face . use lens-pen , fine blower-brush . or wait until you've stepped under water it . put simply , it my experience if you keep your grubby paws off it , don't try ' clean ' it your cotton t-shirt/flannel shirt/etc , instead use methods used fine coated glass elements , it look like new forever . mine , it desert dust swamp mud . battery , fact , eventually lose energy ! normal use , you expect year or more battery . if you one those fellas shows everyone he meets his " neat digital compass " , or actually rely this your primary compass brush , it won't last nearly so long . digital compass primary energy-sucker , likely much backlight . use compass only when needed ( you should base-plate compass anyway ... suunto also makes some best these well ) . review stating watchbands give out , i find remarkable i never problem mine , i wear it constantly , day day out . all all , spite fact i return my first two , i heartily recommend vector . tough useful	1

i my homework investigated various brands models spinners person . i went schwinn ic elite because , time purchase , it sold less money than model below it , ic pro . i originally planned purchase ic pro but made no sense when better model cheaper . i wanted gym quality spinner i planned ride regularly would not need ever replace . i read many reviews amazon talked equipment good starter equipment if buyer actually wound up using it , they'd upgrade later . that not my style . if i'm buing it , i'm using it ! ic pro ic elite both built last lifetime . i didn't order schwinn because i would incurred additional charge delivery installation , mandatory , plus hefty new york sales tax . i ordered directly schwinn , who send nautilus representative bike put it together , trials tribulations followed would probably avoided . first , amazon sent wrong bike . they sent ic pro instead ic elite . i request replacement pick-up incorrect bike . i tip delivery people help me get very heavy/sturdy bike back into box return shipping . correct bike came week or two later . bike comes mostly assembled i no problem putting it together . it really just requires putting stability bars pedals . unfortunately , when i got bike , which supposed gym quality , it provided terrible ride . wheel seemed wobble , it noisy there some sort grinding going which made whole bike vibrate . i requested serviceman come out fix it . customer service people nice , but somehow service order didn't make it through service department few weeks . i finally got serviceman out he said wheel it assembly would replaced . wheel gets assembled china this particular job faulty . he ordered new wheel shipped me ten days went until serviceman could return replace wheel . we opened box replacement wheel found schwinn sent wrong wheel ! again they sent ic pro instead elite . new wheel ordered , couple weeks get service . wheel replacement trick bike rides like dream . i am now totally happy my spinner . four stars instead five because it took couple months get happy my purchase . i purchased it april 5 . today june 16 , red letter day bike finally works well . me cost savings purchasing through amazon worth couple months inconvenience . i might felt differently if it winter when i'd rather stay home ride than go out gym .	1

this disc certainly best i played . it rim lower than those made frisbee , which gives disc much nicer feel . it flies well , material also good : not super-soft or thin , so it doesn't warp easily , but soft enough it won't hurt your hands when catching fast throw . i recommend it all players , but especially those more experienced ultimate players	1

this my favorite carry flashlight , it hardly takes up any room no matter what pocket you put it . high setting it lights up broad area few lights any size match , i large collection luxeon-based lights up 5 watts one k2 . k2-based light runs two cr123 batteries tends get hot , which fenix doesn't . since it runs one battery it easy tuck battery away case you really need lot light long time . strobe very impressive , looks like it projecting 135+ watts . sos little slow , but it usable . when you get good twisting it on/off you one-hand it without lot fuss setting it minor twist . if this portent future , i can't wait see what other cree-based offerings come other manufacturers . highly recommended	1
works very well . long lasting . not warm i hoped	1

i ordered this backpack temporary solution . i thought it cheap ($20 item , around $10 shipping ) , but now i realize it isn't . maybe i start negative aspect product : too simple , only one big one small compartments , small one front pocket . addition , straps small . i am big , but i see many larger people than me around honest if you aroun xl or xxl size it would quite uneasy put backpack over jacket its straps simply too shor t.t he good part : it looks durable , business , now i keep it spare since i now one(not jansport :) but sill , price somehow appears alittle too much me . same amount i gave i could find real nice adidas or nike ( original ones :) back my country	1

took this brand new pack 3 night , 4 day trip through sierras . i my sleeping bag bed roll straped bottom tent wedged front panel pack itself . this pack big enough carry all gear i needed 4 days . trails major climbs up down trails carved into granite . my pack weight 40lbs . pack held together great . extra lashing points front panel handy when used carabiners small items such water shoes , flashlight , sierra cup . my only real gripe two side mesh pockets . they rendered useless because bottom adjustment/cinch straps outside mesh pockets only thing you get there flat map . what i ended up doing cutting two slits each pocket passed adjustment straps through slits inside pockets . gave me use pockets back . addition , mesh pockets little no elasticity . full pack , it still tough getting item such sierra cup mesh pockets impossible get 32oz water bottle there . anyway , money this pack good deal . i thought sure this pack would've shreds after trip . well , after inspecting it after trip , no rips , no bad seams , nothing torn or broken .	1

my first kershaw knife . but not my last . fact , my second kershaw already ordered . blown away quality this product . extremely smooth operation . outstanding fit finish . sharpest knife , right out box , i ever purchased . sweet	1
even though it relatively inexpensive pocket-knife , i poured over reviews , compared more trendy benchmade , spyderco , kershaw knives , went over every option swiss-army . why not more expensive knives ? because i wanted compact knife more than one blade . i also wanted more options than they offer . yes , i'd lot cooler carrying lastest spyderco or benchmade - but i'm practicality . i little concerned how well it would hold edge . more expensive knives stronger , denser , carbon-based steel , but it comes cost . they're little more prone rust . i read up victorinox , although it might slightly softer metal , it virtually impervious rust . it compact folding knife multiple blades i plan using outdoors quite bit , this concern . so far , i've used it quite bit it remains super-sharp day it arrived course , absolutely no rust , stains , or discoloration . i chose harvester over other swiss army knives following reasons . i wanted silver metal exterior texture , not slick red plastic tends scratch . silver also makes me feel like it more durable looks much more expensive . small pruning blade - i use this one most often . hook shaped point this blade makes opening anything very simple . saw - wow . teeth extremely sharp arranged such way they rip thru wood . i tested it scrap piece 1/2 " plywood even though you only make small strokes , it wouldn't take long saw thru decent size limb . awl perfect scratching starter hole nails drill bits . overall size knife not too small not too large . you barely notice it your pocket . overall build quality excellent . you feel like you're getting more than your money worth . only feature i sort miss lanyard attachment . it available other knives , but it tradeoff size options important me . that my review . i use heck out thing am extremely happy it . you too	1
i hoping more around wrist type lanyard but this around neck clasp not my use . i needed it use carrying around usb flash memory , but clasps where large fit into holes made smaller clasps . i would say these still nice gym teachers ref out there need them whistles	1
i'm only 5 ft 9 inches but i always seem fall off edges mat during classes . this mat really keeps my attention class instead repositioning so much . extra thickness great - i see other people doubling their mats get extra cushiness	1
overall , i think this good product just what it promises ... helps you easily spool line onto your fishing reels under appropriate tension . this keep your line tight reel , maximizing amount line it hold preventing line digging into spool under load fish . i would point out instructions attached bottom unit lacking when it comes spinning reels not mention or illustrate you ( should ) rotate spool holder bracket 90 degrees so your spool facing sideways your reel . you also should flip spool line bracket if it looks like line coming off twisted instead loading smoothly . most good fishing lines come instructions explain this process specific spinning reels . battery-powered line stripper worked fine me heavier trolling line ( 30-50lb . ) , but i haven't used it thinner lines yet . instructions product descriptions not mention it , but my model , line stripper also revolving sharpening stone protruding end honing hooks -- nice added bonus ! this exact stripper sold separately amazon.com under name " berkley pocket line stripper/hook honer " -- look it up closeup photo more details . package i received came two spare orange rubber wheels line stripper , but it also came two black rubber grommets spooling bracket not depicted or used anywhere instructions , illustrations , or this unit ... they removed insert bracket into base . not sure what up . lastly , everything breaks down stores together so it hung wall until needed . set up takes only seconds	1

like other reviewers , i also posted this review identical product sold directly amazon - which where i purchased it . let me start out saying this rower not perfect . it , fact , flawed . you may noticed , i still gave it five star rating i try explain reasons doing so . reading reviews here , i noticed two complaints : one pointing out this machine doesn't perform same standards professional gym rowers other regarding assembly this machine . i researched various rowers available market quite while . i spent lot time effort driving around trying various models before purchasing this one simply because i tend informed shopper who wants get value his money . during my research , it became very evident my favorite rower water rower followed schwinn windrigger - both extremely smooth their operation . both also $1000 ! any rate , these sophisticated rowers gave me benchmark against which compare integrity it should surprise nobody integrity doesn't really come close performance either other two rowers . it shouldn't , given it substantially lower price . this exactly what it important considering this rower : you cannot expect get professional-grade rower such low price just like you cannot expect get comfort performance rolls royce if you buying honda . nonetheless , what you get integrity well within parameters what i would expect $200 . machine reasonably stable , it reasonably smooth , it provide great workout . noise level also not too bad actually seems less than windrigger . electric monitor basic provides speed , time , calories burned , distance . it also provides option continuously cycles through all these functions so you cant track all them during your workout . seat comfortable slides smoothly track whole thing actually pretty professional look it doesn't appear flimsy . i also quite surprised level resistance this rower provides - it much more than schwinn windrigger . addition , resistance adjusted pretty easily . i think my only disappointment air-flow created during operation not channeled toward person using machine aid cooling him/her down - but this certainly flaw i live . potential buyer you should also aware rower tends slide across smooth surfaces such tile - which means you need non-slip mat under it if you intend use it such surface . i said before , i also read least one person problem assembling this rower . i cannot confirm this problem . assembly extremely easy quick - even though instructions not greatest . however , it should quite clear most people where parts go what needs hooked up where . winding up chain onto gear wheel breeze , too . all you need unhook it retracting cord you hooked it up one or two steps before . i suppose person who wrote instructions could switched these steps make it more logical - but i said , instructions not great . taking all these factors into account , i think integrity provides fantastic product very low price . it exactly what it supposed it so surprisingly good manner . however , any product , your expectations should realistic if they , you not disappointed . if you expect gym-quality machine - you not get what you looking . if , however , you looking basic functional rower without all bells whistles high-end products , then this probably best deal you get	1
i never ordered something like this web before , but after reading positive reviews here decided it . i could not find rower town less than $800 . this rower sweet arrived idaho east coast 6 days after i ordered it ( amazon ) . it easy enough assemble works great . i am middle aged woman , weighing around 175 ( under max . rower limit 250 ) feel safe comfortable when i'm rowing . also , seat cushioned it glides easily track . i not find it loud all kind like cool swishes air when i'm rowing . you won't sorry ordering one these i think it way more fun way get shape ! get one .	1

yoga mats come three basic thicknesses newer fourth thickness becoming increasingly available . 1/4 inch , this mat one latter kind tops even " thick " mats ( 3/16 " thick ) designed those who need or want extra cushion . it exactly two times thicker than average mat . 24 " 68 " it also standard width length . mats one fourth thick this one ( 1/16 " ) good travel or placing under thicker mat provide more traction . average mats 1/8 . " there two sides this nearly all yoga mats . look carefully ' bumps ' each side mat . larger bumps designed face upwards cushion your hands , feet , knees during poses while keeping your body dangerously slipping out alignment . smaller bumps designed face downwards grip floor keep yoga mat sliding . many mats label one end name brand . this typically , but not always , located ' up ' side . bumps tell you sure . this yoga mat increase softness stickiness use . ( so most mats . ) they start out mildly sticky increase stickiness more they used . you want wash your mat when it first arrives so remove thin film they get their surface during manufacturing process . instructions washing mat included . once you've washed dried your mat you're ready begin ! after using it while , if you find mat decreasing stickiness each time you pull it out , this typical sign light coating dust or too much body sweat accumulated your mat it needs light hand washing very diluted soap water . after washing , roll your mat thick towel squeeze out excess water , otherwise it take forever dry air . then , air dry your mat unrolled , inside , away sunlight . ( hanging over shower bar works nicely . ) when you first unroll your mat you find one end bit curled . simply alternate direction you roll your mat ( top outside once , then bottom outside next ) or end you start ( curled end once , flat end next time ) you'll find it straightening out more or less over time . i recommend buying your own yoga mat even if your yoga studio or gym provides them you . i've worked many studios gyms over years . sometimes management mats cleaned often , sometimes not . if you bring your own mat you always know where it . :o ) plus , owning your own mat may encourage you begin valuable practice home . my students who trouble their knees some poses requiring body weight rest knee , i recommend temporarily folding over one end mat get double cushion under knee while still leaving one layer under rest body . this saves you haul more than one mat out each time you practice which discouraging especially beginner .	1

" however , someone intent criminal act just might notice , avoid me altogether . great knife personal safety . lastly , like other reviews point out , these knives sharp . i don't use mine open letters , boxes typical pocket knife activities ( i believe would gum it up , slow opening speed knife ) , so i anticipate blade should good , long life my care .	1

my husband bought me this bike my birthday . we really searched best bike , thanks other reviews we bought this bike . this bike accomodates me 5'9 " , my husband 6'3 " no problem . it very quiet . although mine developed small squeal , it still not even loud enough me really care or call advice . i gave this bike 4 stars because computer comes off little too easily . i many small children they take it apart lot . nothing little sticky tape cant fix . my mother law bought bike two thousand dollars ours almost identical ( hers not develop small squeal obviously ) . even programming choices same . mine little lower floor also ( those you kids house appreciate lower profile-your kids shorter distance fall off when they climbing it ) . good deal money- feels solid well built , yet i move it one room easily(when so inclined ) thanks " rolling endcaps " frame . aslo easy move vacuuming	1
faithful readers may read review my previous dealings rower brand . i using this rower few weeks now i am very pleased . other reviewers noticed , magnetic resistance very quiet . i sometimes get rattling seat , but not much . okay , unlike other machines , max weight limit this machine 350 pounds ( not 250 ) . lcd display great my dim basement , heart rate feature heat ! i waited try feature before i wrote this review . it compatible my polar heart rate monitor existing chest strap(one supplied anyway ) . pulse program useful it raises resistance raise your heart beat preset target also reduces resistance lower your heart rate target rate . there even pulse recovery feature when you stop rowing . it monitors how quickly your heart rate recovers minute displays your score 1-6 nearest tenth . preset programs options varied enough prevent boredom . if there any drawback , it way operator manual needs couple readings get meaning across . fact , i basically tell you more pulse recovery feature than they manual . barring , i able assemble rower myself one session using tools came it . overall , very satisfactory balance price features . ** update ** 16 march 2007 : i part break seat . i called customer service not only spoke human , but human states ! part it way day . now what i call positive experience	1
though once this piece excercise equipment built , it everything advertisements , print infomercial , declare . however , somewhere , i swear , i read it takes only 45 minutes put together just taking parts 5 large boxes took well over hour . further , actual installation took over two days ; i'd like think my buddy myself pretty good these things . however , i said , once put together , this one solid , helpful piece excercise equipment . one more thing , sure you space it once assembled . it really large piece equipment , both vertically horizontally . good luck	1
we bought disney minnie mouse trike our daughters 2nd birthday her eyes just lit up when she saw it . eventhough she can't quite pedal bike her own just yet she loves ride it us pushing her . we going get pedal blocks make it easier her learn pedal . i would highly recommend this trike any little girl	1
intone jogger exactly what i looking , hopefully help get my ankles shape , rest me . i read other reviews , really expected difficult time getting it put together . my husband i got it all less than 15 minutes . it great ! i've looked local stores , can't find joggers like this . when i find this , shipping free , it much better deal than i could find anywhere else	1
it required strong man assemble it . stability bar great ! video much needed addition because it hard find something trampoline . it really supports suggested weight . i think price little high considering it doesnt fold	1
exactly what i wanted described . it bit harder put together thani would liked , but once , it works fine	1
i'm 33 , but kid heart . this great purchase . easy learn lots fun . i ordered size bigger than my regular shoe size it fits perfectly	1
we gave this trike our son his third birthday . he pretty tall , but he no problems reaching pedals . took bit put it together , but that case any new trike/bike product seat kept wanting slide down , even after tightening . eventually , my husband got seat stay . if your child over 3 feet tall , you should able adjust seat enough get his/her legs pedals .	1
i 2 3.5 year old they both love this toy- i'm ordering one because they fight over it . we put it sandbox it easy them control they literally spent hours playing it	1

this kayak great kayaking shallow streams . firstly , it very light . i carry it comfortably moderate distances over dry land . this allows me avoid various obstacles water ; just run ashore , pick boat up carry it past obstacle . fallen logs arent problem any more ! secondly , it very durable . ive using kayak year now absolutly no problems . there extremely durable outer shell made nylon which protects part boat actually inflates ; this prevents any kind sharp bushes or protruding brances puncturing anything vital . bottom coated rubber which yet show any defect . rubber realy helps shallow water , or even no water , rocks dirt puncturing inner tubing . thirdly , probably most importantly , it sinks into water only little bit . paddling 5-6 inch deep water isnt problem it most boats , including inflatable sit kayaks . boat also alot fun ocean , much moreso than standard ocean kayaks . this mostly because you cant hurt yourself kayak run into you , or flip over you . playing waves really enjoyable . boat comes mesh bag draw string backpack straps . this good idea ; mesh allows water drain out after boat packed away backpack straps suprisingly comfortable . there some problems boat . maximum wieght may 250 pounds kayak , but this pretty unrealistic . 150 pounds i sit comfortably kayak without there significant bending problem , where middle boat wants sink lower than ends . 200 pounds bending problem comes rather obnoxious because water collects right where youre sitting . you get wet using kayak if youre over 150 pounds , or inexperienced paddler . there some tracking problems eliminated using skegs . skegs , course , make boats clearance much more nuisance . tracking issue isnt issue experienced paddlers , but if you want your inexperienced friend take kayak whirl , he'll spin circles hour before getting hang it . inflating kayak very easy adn takes 5 minutes . deflating kayak bit trickier , taking 10 minutes . buying sevylor pump both pumping vacuum function reduces time needed deflation	1
this set great cost-benefit ratio . clubs perform well also look good . only drawback bag not come travel cover , neither it support keep it standing while playing . overall evaluation very good though	1
i love this water bottle . it perfect me . i love no leak feature straw seems hold up under lots biting . wish it little smaller bottom so it would fit into my car holder better . no complaints so far .	1
my family absolutely loves this machine . it tons different styles workouts . i've long history running , this thing gets my heart rate going gets me huffing puffing . only complaint i , it squeaks . we've tried lot different things stop squeaking , some days it doesn't squeak , others it .	1
i hit lot " almost golf balls " which hard foam rubber practice balls , my back yard . i gone through hundreds wooden tees which made my back yard look like driving range . these tees solved problem . now i 2 or 3 tees out there they last forever . great solution my particular situation	1
this bottle little pricy . but it what it claims . it preserves hot water temperature very well . i didn't try cold temperature . construction very solid high impact resistent ( good portability ) . i no doubt it last many many years . all , i am happy quality this bottle . but , i take 1 star out due its premium price	1
it doesn't weigh ten pounds , like some claiming . it weighs 4 most , i'd say . quite difficult hold one-handed though , * really * difficult resheathe it without propping sheath up or something . it really doesn't much edge all , contradiction what i've reading other reviews . particular sword i received amazingly good condition . blade nearly pristine . it straight arrow . sheath fits snugly , but misaligned bit takes some work get tang into it . there no rattle when you swing it ; it feels nicely solid . this sword astounding value , all all . 68 " just doesn't really register until you're standing next it . materials nice , workmanship excellent , packing job zealous say least	1
if your like me you probably waiting someone make this 10 years . so when i found it here , i really no choice but buy it . first all i need remind you this sword 68 " long . if your not sure how big , get measuring tape out see . you might find out it bigger than you . also sure you spot hang it . shipping pretty quick . it delivered ups it came day early . shipping also $22 . when i opened it i surprised find there some detail put into handle like some people looke like samurai some weird looking animals . i also surprised blade actually sharp edge it , i expecting it just big chunk carbon steel . it pretty cool look yourself mirror holding something you idealized since you kid , swing it hear nice wind sound . although you won't able swing it many times , because it weighs 10 pounds . now , few things i didn't like it , which probably what you want hear . first they put this vasoline type gel it keep it rusting , which i understand when you buy carbon steel sword , but i just can't get stuff off . everytime i put it back into its holder more gets . also there looks like something resembles waterspots it . i guess i got polish it . second thing i didn't like made china carved into blade . third , theres little glue running down where hand guard . all all , this great sword . especially if your final fantasy nut like me also sword nut too . something so rare collection $99 why not get it . i'm also going add , even thou i shouldn't , this sword not used . i know your probably saying " " right now me . but when your holding it your hand your probably going get urge hit something . i'm just going tell you physics going against you , because how long thin blade . although i think it pretty cool watch sword fight , so if you decided record it post it . thanks reading	1
my 6 10 year old boys use this backstop regularly . they put batting-t front hit hard balls into net , then use it behind them ball-catch hitting pitches(sponge balls . ) it red square strike zone helps pitcher find strike zone , when facing net , provides target hitter . it pops open great force so carefull when you set it up first time . my 10 yr . old folds it puts it away us . this quality product essential piece training equipment any age . we like jugs machine balls use backyard . they dense yellow sponge correct size , weight seam . unlike regular training balls , we not broken window them yet .	1

when i bought this product it because i wanted way work out home but i not enough money buy expensive tredmill or eliptical thought this cheaper alternative . i worried because i read lot online reviews stated it very hard put together but i not find case i just dont think people realize it takes 30 45 miniutes assemble but directions easy understand i got it together out any major problems . i also read reveiws states machine very squeeky which it times me but if you just spray some dw 40 it little seems solve problem . i orginally wanted use machine while watching tv but i usually dont feel like i am getting much workout . my machine came dvd ( i bought mine hsn ) when i follow those i feel like i get much better workout . its good watch them least see all diffrent execrcises you this product . machine fold up but it not something should considered very portable . i thought i would able keep it closet take it out every day but it just hard . i am happy i bought this product it easy it very low impact . i would recommed it others .	1

this reasonable light certainly good job making you visible motorists . i would agree reviewer brightness - it not really bright enough use only source illumination . me most disappointing factor ' no tools ' fitting strap . it grips poorly glossy surfaces - like many handlebars , example ! i ended up gluing rubber patches inside strap improve this . worse , strap tensioner actually broke apart after just over year use . pivot pins just not up rest build quality . pros- good light sodium lit city streets- really waterproof- solid casecons- ' no tools ' strap simply sucks . - you'll need light if it genuinely dark where you ride . not really worth investment . i bought cheaper 5-led light - proper screwdriver tightened quick release fixing - i am far happier . cateye now expensive spare flashlight .	-1

i bought this my son 4th birthday . he everyone else love it ! his legs short i thought he still needed trike . he absolutely loves tow hook back . it extremely well made tow package very strong sturdy . seat multiple positions plenty growing room . my 6 1/2 year old loves it too . they both hook things up tow them around . this far cutest trike out there i would definitly reccommend it . it slightly confusing put together , but once i got things figured out it easy . instructions just aren't thorough enough , but it just basically common sense anyway . this wouldn't keep me getting it . just thought i should totally honest it .	1
we ordered this trampoline our four year old christmas present . it best $30-$40 we've ever spent . she very energetic jumping seems calm her . even middle meal or conversatin , she start jumping . small trampoline fits our living room right family room area dining area , so she plenty opportunities jump . this bit stiffer not much bounce outdoor trampolines , but if it bouncy , it would more dangerous four year old , it would sag floor , since it isn't high off ground . it low floor , not super bouncy so i don't any safety concerns it . now , if i could just motivate myself exercise it , it would even more find .	1

i purchased this sale , so made this extra good value . , amazon ships this fast -- it took 3 or 4 days receive . it very easy put together . i wanted this before my husband came home , so i add rubber mat flooring put this together , which i able . only part i needed help stretching gray resistance band getting pulley bolt , since it difficult hold band lessen resistance screw bolt same time . it really pretty easy instructions surprisingly well-written . you must measure bolts since they close size . machine great price . only thing makes this difficult machine use how resistance altered . part very poorly designed i keep meaning go hardware store find alternative hook or clip use . way leg attachment cables need changed enough make you want choose some other exercise over leg extensions ! however , if i find some clips similar what bowflex uses its resistance machines ( they built totally differently -- but i like their clips/hooks ) , i think changing resistance much more pleasant definitely easier . machine enables you very many exercises . leg curls great , preacher/machine curl attachment wonderful . you even leg presses this machine , believe it or not , but only 130 pounds . still , that great me ! lat bar gets lot use that easy adjust . all resistance upper body much easier adjust than leg attachment exercises . still , they aren't easy pulling clip reinserting it . benefit here bench itself . it adjustable many positions ( no decline ) , when upper part removed , you use machine rowing machine . , i've tried many rowing machines , this one very smooth almost fun use . all all , this great value , but not user friendly it should . my husband i love it since we now don't wait eachother equipment when we similar workouts working timer , since we already other equipment . so , we extra bench now , extra upper lower pulley station now , it makes working out together much more fun	1

6 time marathon runner triathlete i tried more than my share gels substances carb replacement . my running group favor clif blocks number reasons . 1 ) they taste great not too sweet . over course long event you can't stomach more gel after while --- these seem go down ok hours into event . 2 ) they carry well don't cause mess like gels . even gel flasks leak , but no problem here . 3 ) you vary your intake ( one cube every 10min or 2 every 20 or 3 every 30 or 40 ) . you also get them down without water . yeah , little pricey but well worth it if you serious doing outdoors thing	1
this elliptical great , i able put it together 1-2 hours . i've it 2 weeks so far works like charm . only reason i give it 4 stars every time i turn console it makes loud beep ( design ) , which problem because i usually workout late night , when kids asleep ( loud noises sometimes wake kids up ) . there mute option , but it only works after console turned . other than ( which really minor annoyance ) this machine great	1

i am soldier who recently returned deployment . while i deployed i injured both knees am unalbe run due impact . i tried ellipticals while i deployed quite impressed work out i got . when i returned i went out started searching one my own . my goal keep it under $1000 . i tried many different brands discovered not all ellipticals created equal . many them cheaply made shake side side or make alot noise . stride very important . i am 6 foot tall 16 inch stride some them just didnt cut it . i ended up buying proform 160 proform website since it 18 inch stride seemed sturdy , however , after discovering how little they care customer service , i cancelled my order . i ended up buying image 9.5 walmart . i used it 3 weeks came conclusion foot pedals spaced too far apart it put pressure my knees made my hips hurt . after thinking it minute it made sense me , who runs thier feet far apart anyway . my feet almost land straight line when i run . so i set out find one closer pedals . overall i tried almost 2 dozen different machines finally found schwinn 430 fitness store . i tried 418 438 also , but 430 seemed most comfortable me . 438 some other brands seem high arch upstroke . 430 very smooth ultra quiet . it very well made should last many years . amazon best deal it it me 8 days . it very comfortable machine . after all this i would say anyone wanting buy elliptical , try alot them , i tried all ones sears , oshmans , academy fitness motion . make sure stride length , pedal angle pedal spacing comfortable you , after all , if its not comfortable you wont want use it . only thing i think could improved schwinn 430 backlit display . luckily i work out lights so its not problem , haha . i tried many machines $2-3000 this one still more comfortable me . it heavy machine , so get help carrying it , but you glad its heavy when you ride it . it some assembly required , but it fairly clear instructions , so there shouldnt problem assembly . happy hunting	1

i bought used rower years ago came work it several times week . i'm busy person , so i don't time sophisticated work out routine . i just want work one machine both strength aerobic training . rowing great this purpose . when i broke my rower , i started shopping . unfortunately , even used rowers over $100 . i struggled this model versus smaller ones stand up vertically easy storage . i couldn't find any reviews this addressed storage question . finally , i chose it because it didn't look like i could break it normal usage , whereas kind fold nicely seem flimsy . pros : - this machine very sturdy . it solid , stable , not rock all when use . - it amazingly quiet . only sound whisper pistons . i use it tv normal volume . - seat very comfortable . i sat it 30 minutes first time no discomfort . cons : - it not fold , collapse , or stand up vertically . it just sits floor . it would very awkward try store it under bed . don't lift back end too far or plug timer bend . this why it only 4 stars . - front bumper pads just stuck . you can't drag it backwards without them popping off . back ones also just sit there , but they face sideways , so they won't come off . - instructions difficult . my wife i kept flipping back forth manual figure out which bolt each step direction referred . work out great . i really like using this machine . i only wish i better place put it when i'm not using it	1

i initially tried order my kettler kadett company called mercantila , a.k.a. rowingmachines.com . it complete disaster nightmare including some false advertising , trying cover up some mistakes their part which caused month delays , some horrible customer service ( or lack thereof ) , some false charges , lot headaches . eventually enough enough i wound up ordering it directly amazon , which cost me few bucks more , but well worth it . machine comes mostly disassembled took hour half put together . there few confusing moments instructions only pictures no text , so making sure you right part takes little extra focus . it came all tools necessary except allen wrench which necessary one small thing . terms overall quality , it very high . i'm not concerned this thing breaking , nor it rattle or ill-fitting parts . said , housing computer little wimpy doesn't attach very securely main body i've knocked it off couple times . small piece tape base kept it firmly locked into place since . some people complained location straps foot plates . i actually find their location ideal , although they tend loosen themselves during workout . i made trip down store bought some velcro which i sewed onto straps . it took 15 minutes i now best foot straps world . best thing this machine , reason i bought it , it really fact mimic actual rowing motion . when i close my eyes i actually believe i'm boat water which makes my workouts much more pleasant . so anyone any doubts , you fact believe hype , it like rowing boat . additionally , all action very smooth . seat very sturdy comfortable it doesn't wobble . arms also smooth grips spin freely . one other reason i bought this machine i'm very tall kadett adjusts accommodate my size . it this placing footboards center beam slides inside central housing . this beam adjusted allowing my incredibly long logs get full complete extension without seat hitting end it track . although it takes up lot space during use due outrigger style " oars " , it fold up size traditional hydraulic rowing machine 30 seconds . i keep mine leaned up against wall out way adjacent room , it not very heavy it isn't big deal pulling it out every morning . one problem i discover , numbers one my adjustable hydraulic pistons misaligned . so it minor nuisance set resistance initially i it feel . preview , kadette appears overpriced compared virtually all other hydraulic rowing machines . but it really completely different kind animal terms rowing action makes it worth price tag . it still suffers slow start pistons come up temperature like any other hydraulic rowing machine , but rowing motion like heaven .	1

hi ! i'll try make this short , sweet , point . why i bought iti like workout 4-5 days week , but i live la it sometimes hard get gym if i work late or if there traffic . also , my neighborhood not so nice , so i prefer avoid jogging night . enter fitness quest integrity 3000 air rower . assemblyif you assemble ikea furniture or coffee table walmart , then you assemble rower . you put 4 pins , then hook strap rower bungie cord under seat . finito . far tools go ( despite what instructions say ) all you need two wrenches . use socket wrench ( $10 target or walmart ) you'll even faster . qualitythe rower surprisingly good quality price . it made two piece aluminum frame feels sturdy . first , i little skeptical chain connecting rower handle , because it looks really small cheap-o . but , after 30 minutes hard rowing , i could tell chain more than adequate . one reviewer target website said chain exploded into million pieces while she rowing . maybe she faulty chain ; who knows . all i know i row 150 pounds weight stack gym , but there no way i could shatter chain simply rowing . stress test , i even rowed hard i possibly could , rower fine . performancethe performance this thing really great . resistance level smoothness good cardio rower i use gym . this air rower , so resistance increases harder you pull . additionally , you increase resistance wrapping tension strap around its base one time before connecting it cord under seat . seat slides very easily , foot pads swivel allow your ankles little more freedom move . also , rower folds vertically easy storage . when it folded , rower 4 feet tall takes up 2 square feet floor space . it easily fits closet or corner . although , it too wide fit under bed . valuegreat value . my buddy rower costs twice much , difference hardly noticeable . performance great , if you buy amazon item you get it tax-free free super saver shipping . i looked couple other rowers ( mainly piston rowers ) nothing even came close this level quality performance price . issuesthe only negative thing i say it little noisy ; even air rower . ( those you who never used air rower , resistance created big fan which makes " whoosh , whoosh " sound when you row . ) noise isn't terrible , but it prevents you hearing tv or radio clearly ... even ear phones . summaryso all all , i think this fantastic value . quality great , performance fantastic . i highly recommend this product	1

very solid well built substitute more expensive reformers . although there few differences convenience certain features - or rather , lack them :) - me they're quite compensated large difference price these ones peak pilates , balanced body other companies producing traditionally designed built reformers ( difference hundreds or thousands dollars , depending other model ) . my few minor issues : 1 . metal t-bar lower out way , althought there only 2 adjustments - up down . it also doesn't lower or rise easily - i thump mine into place . 2 . headrest also adjusts , although again only 2 positions - up ( couple inches ) down . 3 . winding ropes around hooks sides adjust their length various exercises bit time-consuming . more expensive reformers much more easily quickly adjusted nautical-type cleats . 4 . padding adequate , but not comfortable , yet again , more expensive models ( especially , me , shoulder rests ) . 5 . footbar adjust angle ( either straight up or angled back/forward ) but doesn't lower completely out way . instead , you remove it when needed . ( like when you want use included jumping " board " - actually nice little trampoline accessory . ) also , this isn't issue me , but it might someone else - this reformer uses 4 heavy duty bungee cords resistance , rather than springs . bottom line this reformer ( box accessory i bought separately ) , i almost * every exercise ellie herman pilates reformer book without feeling like my reformer wobbly , unstable or distraction itself . i saved lot money ;) *( those you wondering , there only 3 exercises book i can't this reformer . " rocking swan " " grasshopper " , because footbar angle doesn't lower down far enough , " round back " reverse knee stretch , its variations , because exercise your hands hold frame reformer - course aeropilates doesn't side frame boards hold . ) hope this helps	1

everything i always wanted bike , without rig it up myself . this bike made wide range uses , including mine . i like use panniers , this bike rack mounts . i love single speed . this bike rear-facing ( track-style ) dropouts- thus , i one gear each side wheel easily change low high gear without changing chain length . this not really case converted horizontal dropout frames . other non-track single speeds market look like fun but lack pannier mounts . large tire clearance super fun . first time i really noticed it when bike path congested i took off across grass . now i use this bike carry me my research site- 3 miles down primitive road over two creek crossings . so much fun . aforementioned rack , i carry tools out samples back ease . price- this price you get complete bike . no self-assembly required . those you unsure purchasing committing single speed check this out : this bike comes set screw gear cable guides screw-on rear derailleur hanger so , if you so desire , you convert it into multiple speed bike future . this nice know , although i am not sure why anyone would want deal this . once you get this thing going loaded up 50lbs gear , however , you might want avoid mountain passes , unless you don't mind walking or hitchhiking	1
