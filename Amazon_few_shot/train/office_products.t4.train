i bought small one these blank , unlined pages pocket sketchbook . pocket sketchbooks commonly sold art supply stores one two varieties , either wire-bound or stitched . thing , wire-bound notebooks uncomfortable back pocket ( i just don't like feel , bumping up against ridges wires edge ) , most stitched bindings don't fold well moleskine ( folding nice wide so there plenty blank page use ) . honest , i may've fallen just little pompous tripe sketchbook great artists . thing , paper terrible . all ' bloggers geeks i've heard raving these notebooks use them their laundry lists or their ideas write or god knows what . while i'm not best artist around , i minor fine arts school , so i'm not completely clueless . so take my word ( or don't; it your loss ); paper just plain bad . most drawing paper some degree " tooth " -- roughness paper , which rubs off your graphite or charcoal smoothly onto page . tooth these sketchbooks nonexistent . rather than describe more detail paper , however , i believe i give apt description two words . manila folder . that what paper these books like , so nearly indistinguishable ( slightly smoother , fact , than manila folders -- even less tooth ) . while paper quality something personal preference , i've never seen anyone use any paper remotely similar this drawing , so i question claim these pads identical those used picasso et al . positive note , binding great , covers great , elastic strap , bookmark ribbon , back pocket all great features . but when it comes down it , i care most paper quality . if you want just write , get one these . if you intend any serious drawing , don't bother .	-1

while history cool , extent which everyone drinks kool-aid gobbles it up bit startling me . i suppose those people who still care enough physical writing experience pen paper might more inclined romanticize it ( other words , not only great notebooks , see below , but also smart marketing , more power them ) . i also enjoy writing , but respect little 3.5 " 5 " books , purely practical level , i like these simply because there very few notebooks out there provide such high quality writing experience such small volume space . little ( 3.5 " 5 " ) softcover almost ideal shoving your back pocket carrying everywhere , nice , high quality paper . covers durable smooth enough still work well even after acquiring some " character " your back pocket ( ie they actually mold your [ ... ] bit ! ) . i haven't tried fountain pen it ; although i enjoy writing them , i wouldn't use one this application anyway . these little books not really writing great american novel ( or great novel your country origin ) , they're more jotting notes or to-do lists , they work extremely well this role . only reason i withhold one star lack feature would make them completely perfect me ; pen attachment/enclosure provision . my ideal book would able accomodate thin pen spine , so book could slid into my pocket easily no fear snagging or worry whether i remembered " click " pen retract it . i realize this would make it bit bulkier , though . it , my leading pen choices this fisher space pen or zebra g-301 medium point gel retractable , former very , very short ( but bit thicker ) when capped , latter very nice skinny , but longer . anyway , these notebooks pleasure use , though bit costly , how long they last me pleasure ( utter utility ) i get using them , they seem like " reasonable extravagance " me . i'll go through many , many these before i spend what i would cheapest pda	1

i see " linda " already laid down exact same review all colors all nibs this pen , so there not much new i tell you other than , ( 1 ) confirm what she wrote , ( 2 ) , add few new details . this excellent introduction fountain pens those hesitancy buying one . i've collected few vintage new fountain pens over years ; some them lay display box , loved but unused . contrast , you use this pen ! it incredibly cheap quality , so you get basically positive experience ( smooth flowing liquid expression ) without price , or ultimate cost ... losing darn thing . prices ranging $40 $400 beyond ( amazon.com sells namiki fountain pen well over $ 4,000 ) , habitual loser inanimate objects would understandably reluctant invest gold-nibbed , laquered objet-d'art , would opt instead this beautiful cheaply even calls itself " disposable ! " it personal preference , but i'd opt fine nib over medium if you're going use this everyday--you'll write faster use less ink . medium nice big john hancock-ish signatures weighty thoughts , but you lose little expression ( those personal shadings slight angles even untrained can't help but produce ) . steel nib writes surprisingly smoothly , mentioned above , ink doesn ; evaporate too quickly . you can't refill pen ( it disposable just because ) , but you buy several different colors nib sizes , get some idea what kind pen suits you . if when you feel like you want purchase re-fillable fountain pen , try something under $50 . levenger.com excellent " true writer " " retro " brand pens sell this much . although those liquidy smooth gel pens taken some over some non-ballpoint market , mechanically-minded enjoy physics bottle-filling pen ; others simpy dig tradition using pen rich history . when it comes fountain pens , " " panache .	1
