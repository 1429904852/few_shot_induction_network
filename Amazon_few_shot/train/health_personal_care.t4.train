i offered one these while cycling thought it very tasty . so good , fact , when i got home i went straight web site show back wrapper learn where i could buy them . just above web address nutrition ingredients list . probably mistake manufacturer part it gives you something read while site comes up . oops ! this bar whooping 25% your daily allowance saturated fat ! not only , but fat palm oil . this might acceptable soldier involved prolonged strenuous activity but i doubt cardiologist would recomend it most us . commercially formulated product more likely fill average person need lower fat ( healthier fat ) energy bar , than one formulated extreme physical activity , sold profit marketed patriotic tribute troops . bottom line : read label , weigh health risks if you want support troops , there better way than eating hooah bars .	-1

i bought two boxes these luv diapers ( thats 448 diapers ! ) i sure wish i spent little extra pampers swaddlers . these diapers leak out top because they don't any elastic tabs or anywhere waist . even generic kroger diapers elastic waistbands ! i am just sad i use these crappy diapers so long ! i also think they run small so i probably not even use them all . what waste ! only good thing these diapers price , but , i would highly recommend you just buy your store brand instead if money issue . p.s. i don't like huggies either because they leak out legs ! hard find good diaper	-1
i suppose it serves function people bad eyesight or something . but ...... dear god thing ugly	-1
i happy see this type product available , but not happy when i received it . it seems like flimsy piece plastic , " magnets " looked like they painted , gold-tone , paint looked like it chipping off . base item separate top item , which seems attached springs ? it run , but very loud , like it working too hard . there note not use it more than 20 minutes , which i'm not sure because potential adverse affect user , or because unit might overheat . there some spelling errors outside box ( few places said " reflexology " few places said " relexology " ) -- but maybe just bothers me ? i think it also important note buyer pays shipping , if returned -- also pays return shipping charges ; when combined , nearly equals original cost item . ;o (	-1
i really wanted like this product after reading all their hype how quick easy it . not . motor it heats up quickly thing stops working . you wait 20 minutes it cool down it start up again . but time you getting results one area your foot , thing heats up stops working again . i went through four intervals effective operation , heat build-up causing it quit , waiting long time it cool off before starting up again . finally i decided it isn't worth time aggravation , even though it produced good results during intermittent periods when it worked . one more thing -- when i gave up decided return it , i took my duracell batteries out they blazingly hot . i worry it might possible batteries explode hot-running motor . i've never seen batteries get scalding hot like this . update : found something much betterafter returninng artemis , i tried medicool pedisenso professional pedicure appliance . this one costs 5 times price artemis but soooo much better it well worth it . medicool plug-in electric much more power than battery operated artemis . it variable speeds , 5 different sapphire filing attachments , enough power operate long you need . sapphire files different shapes sizes should last lifetime , whereas artemis requires repeated purchases its disposable filing heads batteries . so over time costs owning artemis add up -- if overly hot motor not burn out . if you serious callouses corns , like i , medicool pedisenso very serious , rewarding job . i'm so glad i found it i am grateful relief it provides	-1

before you buy , sure check where pen made . i number older cross pens say " usa " near top , they great pens . however , i bought three different ones past few years not indicate where they made , they inferior quality . top bottom halves loose , carefully manipulated come together without gap . first one i got , i sent it back cross warranty repair under their " lifetime guarantee , " only receive it back unchanged telling me it just fine - " handling fee " attached . i willing believe it simply anomaly , one bad pen . so later when some new colors came out , i bought two more - only see they same quality defect . my advice : if you want good cross pen , go secondhand store buy one made usa . they aren't making them same anymore .	-1

i thought this hot air brush would make things easier not hold round brush blow dryer . it great idea , but it just doesn't work well . first let me say i shoulder length , normal hair , but lot it . if i air dry , it slightly wavy . i used larger two brushes found it couldn't get through my hair . so then i using second hand try push hair against brush so it would curl around it . didn't work very well , i wound up burning my hands more than once . i also found i couldn't get same nice curl this hot air brush i could get using regular round brush dryer . other major problem brush got extremely hot . if you idea you'll able change larger brush size smaller ( or unit without attachment ) or vice versa , you won't without getting burned . attachment -- even end blow dryer itself -- simply too hot touch . i doing things like using hand towel try change attachments . size shape unit also not optimal . i found it too large awkward use . off button located right where your hand , so it easy bump . also , there no cold shot . if you've come appreciate what setting curl , you'll probably miss it like i . additionally , person mentioned , unit very loud . you would wise buy couple foam ear plugs if you determined keep this brush keep your hearing . i don't believe i read any warning noise , either . it much louder than my traditional guy-style blow dryer . time wise , i found i spent much longer trying get my hair dry , then i wasn't fully satisfied style well burns hassle involved getting there . i gave this try few days then returned it store refund . it made me appreciate traditional blow dryer round brush . some things just not good they seem .	-1

this review covers fb11nr : same unit slightly different control pushbuttons ir remote . somehow , i deluded myself into thinking spinning massagers under each foot powered . nope ... basically just built-in plastic versions those usually wooden massaging rollers one rolls one foot upon . that fine , yet when i want relax , i'm not thinking moving my feet . fortunately , those removable , removal exactly what happened . killer center massage wheel , which supposed powered supposed spin , d.o.a. this unit went back store , we bought fb21 instead . amazon no listing model , so i can't give full review it . it good enough keep . both fb11nr fb21 share some traits . neither one really keeps water anywhere near its original temperature . sound levels vary fairly quiet quite loud , depending upon operating mode chosen ( i db measurements fb21 , but since amazon doesn't list one , you don't get see them ) . fb21 seems slightly better build quality , everything worked out box , so we kept one	-1

idea fantastic . fact i don't wake up immediately like bzzzz--i'm awake . amazingly i hit snooze regular alarm without ever knowing it . this alarm , light starts glowing gets brighter brighter over period time you select . i mine set 15 minutes , usually time light reached maximum i'm coherent enough get up . if light doesn't it , you add sounds ranging buzzer screeching sea gulls -- ocean , wind , ringing bells falling somewhere . flaws : others mentioned , light itself makes buzzing noise low light levels . so when it first pops morning , you also get annoying filiment vibration lamp . secondly , you don't set alarm when you want get up . you go through some math calculations , figuring out when you want wake up how long it take you get point . then you set alarm earlier time ( awake minus groggy equals alarm time ) . third , if you use sound addition light , it increase volume light increases intensity , but sound starts out so loud begin light really pointless . workaround we've found this use external speaker provided . plug it into back light , run it across room , bury it upside down under some pillows . then pick sound like " birds " instead lip-curling " harbor " or " town " . it buried location across room , sound hits right volume time light maxes out . whoever came up plan making sound come light just not thinking . fourth , clock lumination change colors , rotating through entire rainbow all night long its default setting . first looks cool . until you realize bright yellow clock glowing your face 2 a.m. just wrong . darkest setting red , only way choose it hit pause button back when it rotates around color . so yes , it works . it wakes me up without making me use my hammer . but design just plain stupid . if manufacturer would wander here , read this make few design changes , they could make light worth buying	-1

i pretty excited try ion hairdryer . i got this one because i liked idea able ' control ' amount ions coming out . my hair seem little shinier after using it ( only reason i gave it two stars not one ) but my hair felt little drier . almost straw-ish ... it never felt like my old drier . also buttons really hard switch ... all them ! i read review said i thought well how bad it ? i dry my hair round brush my right hand dryer left . i turn dryer off during different times while i am doing my hair . this dryer i could not turn on/off switch my left hand . i put down my brush use both hands . i could not believe how hard it switch ! this main deciding factor returning dryer , it so frustrating not able switch it easily flick your thumb . not mention made me feel like big wussy !!! speed setting only two settings , low high . low setting way too low high setting way too high . middle ground would nice . lastly , dryer smelled little weird . granted , i only it two days before i returned it , so smell might eventually disappear . but it wasn't your normal ' new hairdryer , hot plastic ' smell . it almost slight mildew smell . yuk . so , i would not recommend getting it . i exchanged it vidal sassoon ion sensor dryer . seems working better . low speed setting perfect . smell normal ' new dryer ' smell so far . buttons easy push !!!! sensor ( it automatically turns off when you pur it down ) little off , it takes while turn off . but all all i like it . it also make my hair shiny not make it feel drier or like straw !	-1

this thing comes lots attachments , which i regularly used only 2 . vibrating cuticle pusher silly . far all those round discs , it hard explain physics this , but suffice it say since it rotating circle , you only use half it time or you'll experience bump-bump-bump . thing rotates such speed ( even lowest two speeds ) even leaving your toe or finger moment or two create burning sensation . what i use smallest pointed attachment , which i used lightly go around my nail close cuticle . this good when you're wearing clear nail polish your nails starting grow out . you lightly buff down ridge polish . same goes edge where acrylic meets natural nail . other attachment i used , though less frequently , bigger cone-shaped one ( kind looks like shape foam ear plug ) . i used lightly go over my largest toenails thin them down since i trouble ingrown toenails . again , it challenge not create burn when doing so . nail dryer thing silly useless . if you manage cram your hand into little scoop without smudging polish , it doesn't much anyway dry your nails any faster than just letting them set . buy little fan like they use shops if you want faster drying time . this thing isn't gonna it . other folks mentioned this thing ruined their nails . it likely because they tried use all attachments ( which you'd think you should able , right ? ) . much regular buffing your nail thins it down weakens it too much . bump-bump-bump round attachments likely doesn't help , either . couple times i used this acrylic nails . i tendency wear acrylic nails few weeks then hate them want them removed --- i'm no longer willing subject myself soak-and-pry method nail salons . so alternative soak home , or just trim down myself then thin them more natural curved shape until rest acrylic grew out . however , i mention i this only couple times . that because apparently acrylics bit too much challenge this little " deluxe manicure system . " after sounding like it ailing while it filed down length 2 acrylic nails , it gave little bzz then died . i waited while see if maybe it overheated . i tried other outlets . nope , dead . so i'd pronounce this unfit natural or acrylic nails . if you want something quality acrylic nails , invest dremel tools salons use ( just sure get one low rpm or foot pedal attachment ) . if you want something quality natural nails , go drug store get some sandpaper nail files , rectangular buffer , cuticle pusher . sometimes best solution simplest .	-1

i first bought standard , then large size attempt pair fit well . i used them riding bike winter months . neither pair fit well there most likely very few people who obtain good fit . goggles snug enough prevent wind entering ( prevent tearing ) causes great pressure above ear . rigid design somehow discourages turning your head freely . i retired my clics when i found foam padded sunglasses motorcyclists .	-1

i finally received this product mail after knowing it year . i can't say i'm huge fan deepak chopra . he presents some good ideas , but what i tell he seems consider meditation more mechanism mind body control , leading bliss relaxation , rather than tool unbiased self knowledge , come terms all things one rather might ignore . i find this bias reflected game . game itself , it pretty good - its graphics its originality - learning relax chill out may useful some people . i didn't find process compelling i expected , though . i found i able learn some skills pretty fast , other places i seemed get stuck . one potential drawback if you get frustrated , try start forcing things happen , it defeat purpose meditation . science biofeedback fairly new , i see its potential field preventative health . i just wouldn't put same new age spin things chopra .	1

now i'm writing this review , it seems silly i'm so happy over such small thing toothbrush . but i am . i bought this item not long after i my first ( hopefully only ) root canal crown four years ago , something which i never again want experience my life ( someone else described , it painful expensive ) . growing up , i didn't take care my teeth like i should've , so i'm accustomed always told there either cavity , or start one , more work . after root canal , my mom recommended brush least certain number pulsations/oscillations , because that what she'd recommended her dentist combat her receding gums . this specific item met those requirements , it affordable . when i first started using it , my gums very sensitive it , but quickly wore off , so it seems me it strengthens gums . it also much easier get behind front teeth . subsequent dentist vists my mom shown her gums improved dramatically after using high-quality electric toothbrush such this one ( i honestly don't remember if she this exact model , but ours similar ) , i've not needed any work dentist beyond regular cleanings since i purchased it . far cleaning unit keep it " gunking " up , i'm only person who uses this item , so any extra toothbrush heads still package they came , not dripping into storage container ; so i don't know how combat . but i just take toothbrush head off thing rinse it , then rinse hand-held part , set them back unplugged charger/base ( i only plug it when battery runs low ) things stay clean no problem	1

bad news first : doesn't seem work well without adding extra detergent it seems like this not 3x concentration , like others we found we compensate adding more detergent than directions said get same results we standard formula . otherwise , two products , ' concentrated ' ' standard srength ' same . make no mistake it - this concentrated comes out like heinz ketchup : it seem concentrated , we notice certain amount difficulty getting detergent out bottle , kind reminded us heinz ketchup . 4-star or 5-star product ? standard strength product clearly 5-star product , however owing fact this product not work well without adding more detergent than direction claim , it rates 4-stars our family . trying learn objective info laundry detergent well . . . . following true this product standard strength or 3x extra detergent added : i am allergic most laundry detergents , but this product prevented severe discomfort me 10 years . it consistently among lowest-priced detergents available . addition very easy clothes skin , it work quite well stain-removal department used its own presoak . this good know if you like me trying avoid allergens . it important remember if you buy hypoallergenic powder detergent instead liquid like this , you may pre-soak stains you won't hypoallergenic liquid which it . while " tide " " cheer " also available hypoallergenic formulas , [ " tide free " actually just unscented ] they considerably more expensive work no better my experience . that why i like this " all liquid detergent - free clear , laundry detergent " . objective information tough find ! i actually conduct hard target search true , objective information laundry detergents . there very little beyond which brand causes pollution which , while important , not what i trying find . " consumer reports " test comparisons most popular brands its monthly magazine every couple years they include some detail . " all website " if you looking this product website it under " unilever " you specify " usa " under products , word " all " show up almost every search result . you find " wisk " " breyer ice cream " almost many neat name brand products you would procter gamble site .

this unit power transformer wall socket end instead handheld part . handheld part mostly made plastic . so , it pleasantly light hold , much lighter than my wahl homecare thing . supplied guard things ( you swap change length , etc . ; iirc they range 1/8 " 1 " ) curve bottom so it easier them glide over concave surfaces instead digging pointed end into them . this also makes things more pleasant . don't believe no-mess story , though . it really catch most hair , so it certainly worthwhile , it easy empty hair trap , but i still vacuum remainder afterwards . it doesn't catch it all	1

... i purchased this item remove some debris off my camcorder lens found it job very nicely . microfiber texture feels nice - little beady , but soft textured . using it easy , i just wiped lens circular fashion light pressure eventually debris gone . ( some fingerprints what appeared scratch but wasn't)the packaging little subpar though . it comes plastic bag which you tear open bottom slide cloth out . however doing so leaves adhesive residue , which cloth then sticks you tear it off , making those sections cloth appear phyically different - bit roughed up i'd say . this poor design packaging says store cloth inside bag when not use avoid contamination , so i used scissor cut bottom bag adhesive residue off . i've yet machine wash it , but so far it works well . it just cheap lens cleaning cloth after all	1

i purchased caruso my wife after returning conair infinity . conair infinity not measure up her expectations . she happy caruso feels it good job setting curl . i offer few observations my own . i would think companies produce these devices would more sensative needs broader spectum customer . instance , women different lengths hair . this device provides 6 petite , 6 small , 6 medium , 6 large , 6 jumbo . might fine women shoulder length hair , but not everyone . there not enough one size get job . there not enough two sizes get job . if your hair just cut , it short use larger sizes , unless you long hair start . my wife hair not quite shoulder length , she got problem . so , i figured , no big deal , just order dozen right size . one dozen additional rollers cost $35 . i only paid $29 unit 30 rollers . that not what i call customer friendly .	1

dentist over 20+ years experience , i seen over over again results not flossing one teeth . unfortunate result such neglect cavities ( especially kids ) , inevitable gum disease adults , which both cass over time leads tooth loss . gum disease almost always starts in-between teeth only way clean germs cause gum disease cavities teeth floss . mechanical scrubbing floss key , all daily brushings rinsings not remove in-between stubborn plaque below gumline . bottom line we need floss our teeth if we want keep them lifetime . i heard all excuses not flossing : floss too hard handle , my fingers turn blue , my fingers too fat , i'm too clumsy , floss hurts my gums , etc , etc . this disposable flosser great kids , who may not dexterity load non-disposable flosser , such " flossaide dental floss holder " , which i recommend adults ( see my review ) . i recommended this floss aid my young patients over years i strongly recommend it you well . one still develop habit flossing daily , this device aides mechanics flossing , making it breeze . get it save your teeth ! jim " konedog " koeni	1

i few minor quibbles this razor , but it gives you nice close , comfortable shave . isn't what we want end ? i don't know anyone who buys one these things its " ergonomic design features . " it holds charge good long time , shaves your face nice . rinse it clean running water you're . that what i'm looking . only things keeping me 5 star review i'm not yet comfortable how razor sounds when running . it seems like it always needing charge ... but that how it sounds full charge . it take some getting used i guess .. others might find quiet running mode plus . also , monthly cleaning cutters/combs bit complicated .	1
upgraded this razor after my old remington died , i've very happy it . it cut bit close , which irritated my skin first , but i think just me getting used " lift cut . " this would excellent razor if it wasn't two features ( or lack thereof ) make it pain use . 1 . internal battery nicd . this type battery " memory " it , which means optimal performance , battery should fully drained before you recharge it . otherwise , life battery slowly shorten until battery useless . 2 . there isn't low battery indicator . itself , either these features wouldn't pose problem . combined , you're left wondering when you'll charge shaver , or when you're off business trip , if you'll need bring charger . long run , this razor cheap enough i expect battery last years . still , it would better if battery made nimh or some technology that not 15 years old .	1

replacement blades must . razor remind you once year which fine most cases . but , if you heavy beard or shave more than once day , i , then you should replace blades every 8 months or so . reminder razor only suggestion , not command . after all , it not know when blades get dull . so , i simply ignore reminder replace blades when i feel it necessary . one thing you must use new blades several days until they settle adjust your skin . until then you may little irritation . problem i solved hair my neck . i use think harder i press razor , better it would get those stray hairs . but , all i got rash . i discovered if i simply use very light touch not press hard then it got those hairs much better no redness . replace your blades least once year your face thank you	1

i very satisfied monitor . it easy use seems quite accurate . i disappointed find when i opened box there no instructions included . quick phone call them way . i able use it without instructions but could not set time , etc . all-in-all it quite satisfactory device	1
i like portability adjustability this mirror . it takes up little space stowed away very compactly . it serves my needs very well . i disappointed only magnifying mirror lit . i tend use normal mirror more often . other clock loses it setting when i stow it away . it reset left out if you really wanting use clock feature . far i am concerned ... i looking mirror really could care less clock	1
i using this razor 6 years now , probably long they out . they may pricey but well worth it . i used use disposables nicked/cut my legs almost every time . i switched these maybe nicked my legs very little . it so quick easy use , my legs much smoother than they ever disposables shaving creams . they only last 3-5 shaves , but if you figure price disposables shaving cream , it probably not much more expensive	1
i not overweight many years , but i still last 5-10 pounds just not stay off . i several issues eating - i tend eat very large portions when i am really enjoying meal , i snack lot , i major sweet tooth . this product taken care all 3 problems . i am currently taking 1000 mg 3 times day . i plan cut back little once i'm my target weight . i find this dosage generally suppress my appetite and/or urge eat 3-6 hours . it odd me experience hunger without cravings frantic urge eat ... but that what pills me . most time i tell i'm hungry only because my stomach growling it several hours since my last meal ... but i don't feel like i eat anything right away . i go grocery shopping when i'm hungry not make poor choices , even when i finish up gym after work i don't feel ravenous anymore . i definitely get full faster . it doesn't feel like it used when i overate , i just tell i've eaten enough i stop . what concept ! often i just bite or two good 30-60 min if i'm too busy sit down eat . my urge snack really curbed . i still one or two snacks most days , but they much smaller often more healthy . now i actually stay up several hours past dinner without making mini-meal , which i used almost every night . hoodia not completely kill my appetite , it suppresses it quite bit but more than anything it takes away all my cravings . definitely my favorite part - i used crave sugar morning until night practically every day . since my first day these pills , only time i've sweets when someone offered me something . i'm able eat just little not wish ten times more . it not occur me go vending machine work anymore , or buy candy when i'm shopping . maybe even more than weight loss , emotional benefits these pills incredible me . i'm no longer berating myself constantly overeating or too much candy or dessert . i'm not depressed all day anymore because my favorite pants gotten snug , all i think why i don't willpower prevent it . i would definitely recommend this product , especially anyone who issues food like i	1
tape measure , it what it says it . you press button tape tightens around your body part . you won't worry , " i hold tape tigher last time ? " tension always same consistent measurements every time . tape starts measurement 2 " since tape casing holds tape part measures around 2 inches . i think this tape accurate plus-or-minus half-an-inch but it sure beats regular tape measure since least button ensures each time tape wraps around you same tension level	1
first all , let me say this product great almost every way . so if you need feel better your nose and/or throat , go it . my main complain grossan hydro pulse it noticeably expensive . some time ago , grossan making just his own irrigator tip matching it waterpik machine cost half price hydro pulse . but then , grossan decided produce his own machine , if i'm right , viajet making it him . viajet sells same machine , except grossan tip , -again- half price hydro pulse . breathe-ease solution you might use irrigator also expensive ( i check this comparing it simillar product purchased my country ) . so what makes hydro pulse so expensive ? maybe health business , after all . other than , like i said , this product great almost any respiratory problem . i used irrigate my nose similar solution comes 135 ml bottle , intended use it over 50 times . hydro pulse lets you 500 ml clean everytime , so you get idea . also , if you suffering respiratory problems want chek interesting drug-free treatment , look buteyko method	1

i purchased this dryer replace older one far too loud . while this new one much quieter than old one , it really isn't super-quiet . still , i no complaints noise , but flimsy wall mounting hardware story . threaded holes mounting plate extremely fragile , so much so they both wrung out during initial mounting dryer . it didn't help any mounting holes extremely hard locate once plate mounted - it hard see thru white plastic shell . i ended up discard original threaded screws use two slightly larger metal tapping screws mount dryer bracket . this worked fine , but original mounting hardware isn't very well designed my opinion . other than dryer seems work very well , although i haven't it long enough know how well it last . all all , i'd give dryer 4 stars out 5	1

i found this product after reading review it hairboutique.com . length my hair seemed reached plateau just below my shoulders after year seemed grown no longer . i decided try this product see if it worked . hair growth normally clocked 1/8 inch per month , i decided monitor results my own little " clinical test . " this actually pretty easy because i colour my hair so i'd easily able see how much growth there each month . i ordered box viviscal which i paid $49 ( average price web ) set take first pill following morning ( box recommends 2 per day ) . i coloured my hair night before so one month i'd able accurately measure how much growth there looking growth since colouring . results : i didn't really notice anything until around 2 week time frame . i noticed my nails growing very fast/very long . i weak nails split easily they barely seem grow all . it very noticeable because i use computer all day nail growth causing my fingers constantly slip keyboard . never great nails , i pretty happy see this . my curiosity also getting better me i could see roots my hair pretty clearly which unusual 2 weeks after coloring . i took tape measure measured almost 1/4 inch hair growth . this would mean 1/2 inch per month 6 inches per year . i pretty excited because although numbers seemed small , it twice rate my hair normally grows . but i also noticed something else . my hair becoming unusually greasy . because i very dry hair , i normally only wash it 2-3 times week . but every other day it seemed much more greasy than normal . hmmm . well , 1 month time frame i measured my hair growth it exactly 3/4 inch . not only but i constantly trimming my nails this point . i totally ecstatic . but also this point , i washing my hair every day - it no longer dry brittle , it much softer , but there no way i could miss day washing it or it would greasy . so - conclusions i reached my test this : 1 . yes , viviscal works . it caused my hair growth stimulated over twice speed . 2 . viviscal also makes your nails much stronger grow much faster . 3 . viviscal makes your hair greasy , causing you wash it every day - then it fine . it not cause any extra hair growth anywhere else , which i thought bit strange ( though good !!! ) . i recommend this product	1

i am biochemist education teaching physiology university . such , i am very knowledgeable chemistry human body general . i really like neutragena products this product certainly very high quality . most people , i think it offers great protection , but not best protection people who need very conscious sun exposure possibility skin cancer . according my dermatologist , recent studies shown spf 15-30 wipes off after few hours doesn't offer adequate protection after time . this partly due most people not using enough . other words , they underestimate how much they need apply get level protection . this reason , neutrogena spf 45 or 55 better . also , neutrogena ultra sheer products updated include technology called helioplex . most dermatologists i know feel this makes difference effectiveness some people this going very important . i used both this product higher spf helioplex formulations . practice , i found both adequate my needs . what i particularly like you don't even know you product . it virtually no scent it really so sheer you can't even notice it . both these products stay long time good all day use , but my understanding helioplex formulation even better . further , it feels exactly same skin . only drawback it bit more expensive . this also good product because it protects against both uva uvb rays . both implicated skin cancer it important protect yourself against both . if you looking everyday sunscreen this might one . however , if you want very best protection try neutrogena helioplex spf 55 . this give you most peace mind	1

now i'm writing this review , it seems silly i'm so happy over such small thing toothbrush . but i am . i bought this item not long after i my first ( hopefully only ) root canal crown four years ago , something which i never again want experience my life ( someone else described , it painful expensive ) . growing up , i didn't take care my teeth like i should've , so i'm accustomed always told there either cavity , or start one , more work . after root canal , my mom recommended brush least certain number pulsations/oscillations , because that what she'd recommended her dentist combat her receding gums . this specific item met those requirements , it affordable . when i first started using it , my gums very sensitive it , but quickly wore off , so it seems me it strengthens gums . it also much easier get behind front teeth . subsequent dentist vists my mom shown her gums improved dramatically after using high-quality electric toothbrush such this one ( i honestly don't remember if she this exact model , but ours similar ) , i've not needed any work dentist beyond regular cleanings since i purchased it . far cleaning unit keep it " gunking " up , i'm only person who uses this item , so any extra toothbrush heads still package they came , not dripping into storage container ; so i don't know how combat . but i just take toothbrush head off thing rinse it , then rinse hand-held part , set them back unplugged charger/base ( i only plug it when battery runs low ) things stay clean no problem	1

this variation classic pre-shave lotion , but solid form . main ingredient parafin , petroleum destilate grounded very fine powder molded thru extrusion into solid bar . once it touches your face skin it pulverizes again remains skin fine lawyer talc-like powder . contrary apparences it lubricates skin almost flawlessly . course if you press electric shaver much it burn your skin ! nonetheless this high quality product ( made switzerland ) why rather expensive side , but it certanly delivers 100% its intended use purpose . i always keep 5 o 6 bars one time stock , because i know it too good product before it substituted chinese cheaper import	1

i actually bought this book based all negative reviews it not enough " fill blanks . " i wanted baby book would give me topic let me journal it without too much prompting . there few fill-in pages ( see below ) , but most part i write my feelings thoughts my baby my own words . this seems like much more personal approach , one i think my son appreciate more when he old enough read it , than fill blank pages . previous reviewer complained pages thin newspaper-like . true , they simple white pages black titles , but pages themselves not all flimsy -- thicker than average novel page more like lightweight cardstock . illustrations small , simple , non-intrusive . black white line drawings more iconic than cutesy . my only complaint this baby book i would like more topics ( birth story , tooth chart , food , favorite expressions , favorite toys/games . . . ) however , pages look like they 11 " 8.5 " it bound ribbon , so i think little creativity , cardstock hole punch i may able add my own pages . topics covered ( one full page allowed per topic ): baby name ( fill blanks)family tree ( line illustration fill blanks)all momall dadexpectationsparties showers ( 2 pages)first impressionsbirth certificatehandprintsfootprintslock hairvisitors giftsfirst family photofirsts ( fill blanks)baby favorite thingsdoctor visitsgrowth chart ( fill blanks)medical records ( fill blanks)first birthdaysecond birthdaythird birthdayfirst vacationholidays celebrationsletter momletter dadkeepsakesreflections there also small pouch baby first haircut , pockets back store cards , documents other loose memorabilia	1

i loved idea clapper . i live alone so clapping sound wouldn't bother me i looked forward convenience factor . my first clapper lasted 4 months then mysteriously stopped working , but dead unit smell suspiciously funny - like electrical short . i learn my lesson ? oh , no ! i went ahead purchased clapper some months later . night before last , lamp i connected this one started blinking . i checked lightbulb it ok . it only went i got down close clapper plugged into outlet i heard dreaded sizzling sound saw flash electricity . once again clapper crapped out , this time different lamp , different outlet . i never learn ? thank goodness nothing happened due highjinks this faulty device . you say " housefire " ? again , how dumb am i ? unit ul-approved , if so , any other complaints lodged it ? how one find this out ? i like my gadgets , but " buyer beware " this one	-1

this great scale very accurate . i no problem this . i also difficulty turn it first , but after i read manual , it easy . it very accurate 9/10 gave same weight . 1 pound ( one off . 2 pound ) you need tap it making it vibrating . don't just tap since it won't turn , but if you tap it just like you softly hit it so top glass vibrate , then it .	1
i love these because they're delicious just thing getting me through long workout . they're also perfect traveling , easy pack , sustain you during all day hike or touristy walkabout . friend mine iraq says he eats them twice day , taste , also because -- i agree -- he trusts energy product designed military soldiers much more than energy product designed private company profit	1
reading some these comments , after sampling hooah bar , i understand why these bars give you long lasting energy . they're oily sugary . lots sugar quick energy oil stays stomach longer so you don't feel hungry quickly- that why much fast food so popular , it tastes good its satisfying , but it ain't necessarily good you ! recipe makes it sweeter , certainly oilier , than eating ordinary candy bar . i think snickers tastes better . those who using these meal replacement bars , i'd real careful . bar might ' balanced ' but it isn't meal . whatever energy bar you consume , they're good before workout or post-workout recovery but don't confuse them proper meal all components found there . me , i prefer odwalla bar or cliff bar . less grease , true natural ingredients , less hype	-1
out 3 flavors available , this one favorite both my boys ( 4yrs 7yrs ) . but no matter what flavor its snack they both eat enjoy !	1

this energy drink perfect those late nights when you need mental boost get you through few more hours work . writer often under deadline pressure , i've relied caffeinated products like coke red bull years , but invariably they make me jittery i hard time focusing . not so hooah drink ... like friend giving you leg up onto something , it helps me make it through more work than i could my own , my brain doesn't feel all frazzled like neurons midst aimless firing frenzy when i drink it . my focus actually improves , which makes sense given it designed keep soldiers alert through life or death situations	1

these bars supposed women because they lower cal more calcium . i think there other factors well . men usually affraid products like vitamins women stangely enough , but they say they need calcium protein too . i really like key lime flavor it great . i like lemon also chi tea . i like those flavors because they light tasting i not always chocolate way some people . lime reminds me florida keys . these really better than original cliff bars when they came out i not eat man ciff bar . i used eat one these breakfast everyday soy milk when i busy life . thankfully my life slowed down now . it good grab go food	1

while i love scott brand products ... i don't think this package such great deal .... this price works out $1.60 per roll !! i thought buying bulk supposed cheaper ?? you buy 4-pack around $3.00 , well , least you here florida ! total waste money .. unless it necessary you buy bulk . maybe $20 off special it may worth it ? i'm agreement fellow reviewers ! scott changed ( don't you just hate when companies fix what isn't broke ?? ) their toilet paper now stiff , scratchy feel .. guess that why they came up extra soft version . yes , it seems they weld start sheet roll now .. i think they want you use up half roll just getting it started .. make you buy more more frequently !! i think i'll pass this " package deal " .. i don't money flush	1
i using this product regularly couple years am very pleased it . i notice difference when i begin my healthy day source life shake fruit . due my job , i rarely get lunch break time ( usually late ) morning shake stabilizes my blood sugar carries my through lunch . now several my co-workers using it well . they pleasantly surprised flavor compared other health drinks . i mix it blender bananas , sometimes mixed fruit , lots ice . i also add good squirt flaxseed oil . one co-worker likes it banana , coconut milk , apricot nector pineapple . i highly recommend it very broad spectrum healthy nutrients one good tasting drink	1

i purchased this panasonic oral irrigator take when traveling . since i prosthetic device my lower jaw , i need way keeping area clean . it kind hard lugging regular sized water pik when traveling . this portable unit worked great me . it easy fill handle , water pressure sufficient job . i would even consider using it home daily . very satisfied this product .	1
panasonic ew1270ac portable oral irrigator works well removing anything left behind after flossing , seems it clean any pockets gums flossing cannot reach . only downside two aa batteries not seem last long . would recommend rechargables	1
i am very happy way these wipes perform . they seem gentle they very soft - almost like felt . price great when you babies tow when shopping physical stores you really appreciate large/heavy things like this just appear your door ! wipes container comes extra covering after you raise hinged lid ( presumably help keep them drying out ) my only complaint would when you pull wipe through little opening sometimes " chain " wipes fall back you take whole top off thread them back through opening .	1
i only used this couple times but works great . no problems . it maybe little heavy some numbers attatchments little hard read but aside it cuts great . it runs quiet i found it easy use never this myself before . well worth money .	1
i like green tea diet pill many reasons . first , it causes bored eater ( that'd me ) eating aimlessly throughout day . secondly , since i've taken it 2 half months i ( actually this started happening within few weeks continued ) , capsules helped shrink my stomach probably half what it used , so when i eat , i don't overdo it . keep mind when i say stomach , i mean one your food drops into , not your waistline . however , no means am i saying there no weightless physically . there ! so far i've lost 15 pounds . some you might thinking , " well that surely exercise , i'm not one time , or i hate exercising . " you know what ? those you exercise you'll lose even more weight than me 2.5 month mark , because i go day day doing general stuff , nothing like walking or jogging miles or riding bike . however , i've figured few things key those aren't too keen exercise ( word alone makes me shudder ) . if you don't time exercise routinely or very long , or you just hate word " exercise " ( i know it cause terror within few us , don't lie ) then keep these things mind when you take this amazing pill : -going grocery store ? don't go when you're hungry don't park closest building spot ( unless it dark then it scary ) . obvious reasons , don't go when you're hungry , you'll just end up popping everything into your cart ( some stuff you don't even know what heck it when you get home unpack ) . instead , i'm sure you know this , maybe go after dinner or after lunch . what get ? that few paragraphs down . -going shopping ? word make you giddy delight ?... only until you realize you really don't money doing it ? alright , here solution . go mall or outlet stores or wherever else it you could spend hours looking around stuff . park furthest building spot , leave tempting ways payment either home or your car ( hidden stealth ! ) , go building window shop ! spend least half hour doing this however long ( though you'll get kicked out if you try stay past closing time ) . if you think it weird exercise mall/store , it really not . i know i've seen few power walkers my mall it totally obvious what they're doing , but thing you don't . exercising this way easy just browsing stores , circulating mall , bypassing food court ( unless you need water ) checking out potential christmas gifts while getting regular workout ! -play your kids least half hour day ( outside) ! play hide seek ! run after them ! shoot hoops ( not only it exercise , it helping hand-eye coordination ! ) , throw few balls , kick soccer ball , play swing set , walk around park while your kids play ! there so many great activities family bonding time you get easy workout , too ! it win-win both you your kids . -no kids ? pets next best thing . i three dogs one cat . they're sweetest , most evil things entire world ! not only they make me take run my money ( literally , cause they steal my shoes anything else they get take outside ) they also warm my heart make me laugh smile . 30 minutes playing your pets great way help amplify effects this diet pill ! -have good laugh . find your funny friends , people , laugh much you ! you lose loads calories way!there definitely more small things help you lose weight , especially when taking this pill , but what what food right ? stay away carbs . period . they not your friend all time . especially since they let lose all things your fatty cells need keep their greedy little lives prosperous your thighs/stomach etc . must them ? i know your pain . instead start getting used whole grain wheat . don't shrink terror , it not bad ! eating habits , especially bad ones need rethought when taking this pill best results ! well , that my review , little what i've help you get your way better , happier , healthier you ! i hope this helped least some people ! this how it worked me , but keep mind , every one body unique special it own way it likes losing weight , so just find niche you're good go ! good luck !!	1

there so many varied reviews this product depending which version you clicked ! here what i've found mine : first , this intended work adult acne , occasional blemish . sorry teens , this probably isn't best choice you unless you only occasional break-out . second , this only works new pimples so when you get it , don't expect ones you currently suddenly disappear . it works best when you first notice pimple appearing , especially just starting get sore , slight red spot stage . sad , it actually work , provided you keep first two rules mind ! two days after i received mine , i noticed tell tale red spot beginning form , i zapped it not only it not get worse , next morning , it completely gone ! plus , portion pink version goes breast cancer research if you buy it company ( not sure amazon ) there 30-day money back guarantee . all all , great product	1
food mill very handy . i didn't bother using it my first two kids ( i'd received one hand-me-down friend ) . it seemed too much hassle . fact , it really simple . i use it daily my third child wish i'd experimented it few years ago . our pediatrician encourages us give our child what we eat , not depend gerber or beech nut too much . problem it difficult mash ( spoon or fork ) foods like banana , avocado , potato , small curd cottage cheese other soft foods consistency my child eat ( super smooth ) . this food grinder you . it really easy clean simple tote around . i'll even mill several foods during one sitting , cleaning it food types - it easy take apart , clean reassemble . response other reviews this site , you put cooked chicken into it , or crisp apple , but these won't become smooth yogurt . , you'd add water chicken , possibly add some other blending agent like potato , use electric blender . apple or carrots , you'd need cook it before you could put it into mill it would become smooth ( like applesauce ) . milling foods like corn peas probably result some residual solid bits ( skin pea or kernel ) . completely rid food , you'd use seive ; even electric blender would yield some solid bits . this product probably most useful children ages 6 months 1 year	1

before i bought this product i given sample pack featuring art shaving pre-shave oil , shaving cream , after-shave balm . they called it " one perfect shave " they weren't kidding , really . this far best shaving cream i ever used . though i highly suggest using brush , cream still lathers beautifully or without one . it bonds each hair like rubber glove protects my skin like no other . i never any irritation , none . scent , my girlfriend wouldn't want me use any other kind . sandalwood screams " male " lasts long time . i never buy any other shaving cream	1
first what i like it : it helps suppress my appetite , when i eat i feel full faster . i take 3 day , not proposed 5 day . i taking it month half now , legitimatly lost 5 pounds ( this isn't just fluctuation , i accounted ) . i didn't increase or decrease my work out activities . i swim 3 nights week half hour . i before taking pills , didn't swim any extra days after taking pills . what i don't like so much : bottle says take 2 morning , 1 lunch , 2 dinner . seems so excsessive , pills huge kind hard swallow . this rate bottle only lasts 18 days ( 90-count bottle ) . also after taking it month half straight , 3 day , no skipping ... i went out town weekend forgot pills . well let me tell you , when i got hungry i felt like i hadn't eaten days , i starving . hunger came back like times 10 . so beware ! all around i would , buy it again . maybe month half too soon judge , we'll see	1
this little guy his job pretty well , but pain refill . it pretty much every day or two , it drips quite bit when you lift it out take sink . i would probably buy it again , but bit drag .	1
not much say other than this great product . it similar myoplex lite ( peanut butter crisp too ) bars , but much lower sugar content	1
my initial impression after using it two days now favorable . my gums bled lot , but might because i've never brushed my teeth this insanely till now . i believe manufacturer claim you ' brush 40 seconds ' fairly accurate , here why : because it uses 6 brush surfaces time ( instead 1 regular toothbrush ) , it truly time saver respect . you certainly feel like you geting more out your typical 1 minute brushing you ever before . someone really thinking outside box when they designed this thing . big advantage this product ( me ) , you still only spend 40 second 1 minute per brushing ... vs . 3 minutes+ product like sonicare . i just didn't see myself making commitment keeping it over long haul ( just realistic ) . also , this product requires very little skill properly position ( just bit down , hold hydrabrush two fingers , so it self-pivot ... whereas sonicare other electric brushes require 30 seconds per quadrant you must skilled enough aim it angle it ... sure , not hard , but if your using bad technique , then yours also not doing good job . i accidently run it high first time , before i realized low second click over , not first click over , which seems kind counter-intuitive me . i should looked unit closer , it shows " 2 dots " ( fast ) shows " 1 dot " ( slow ) ... they tried , but i still got it wrong somehow . result my first use high setting , my rear gums bled lot . this documented instruction seem normal ( bleed first few days ) . i think fast speed ultimately what i want use , but slow nearly effective still quite workout teeth gums . clearly , slow best newbies like myself . i write this , i still feel my gums they feel like they got quite workou t.t he brush unit itself quite big , but brushes smaller than expected , which good thing . pictures online made these brushes appear quite huge i wondered how i'd room it all my mouth . some people small mouths might potentially issue using hydrabrush . some people small hands might potentially find holding it bit cumbersome . it works fine me , despite large size . my kids saw me using it today after work they like " wow dad , thats cool " ... " it looks like it really good job ! " . i read brushes not easy put take off -- but it seems fairly easy , not really hard . i wouldn't want share electric toothbrush anyone first place ! i took them off clean off brushes little better , so i removed brushes pressing small metal pin each brush head ( there two brush heads totaland pull ) pulling each one out -- not hard if you ask me . putting them back simply : push , click ... its , then repeat second head . i worry litle dual motors holding up over time . it seems like motors almost bog down times my rear molars , esp . low speed ... but it keep going . you bite down little less it seems relieve motor strain somewhat . i've noticed this mainly only observed after week use . fully charged , it powerhouse . i'm trying see how many days it'll last single charge . so far , two days still going strong . its doing lot work , so i perhaps worry batteries won't last long . i say it " feels " like i just got out dental cleaning , most part . you know , its good , clean feeling -- but also one where you feel bit abused . my teeth gums feels pretty beaten up just 1 minute . i say i perceive 1 minute brush time very effective , based how clean it feels after such short period brushing . it feels like brushed lot longer than i . i hope my gums get used this stop bleeding few more days . bleeding never lasts long , which i think good sign . i read somewhere this toothbrush not waterproof , appears true , it came ' water shield ' go around brush unit , just below where brushes attach . this seems work pretty well it doesn't seem come loose . so far , unit staying dry little no extra effort my part . i don't really use included holder or case , i just set unit side sink ( small washcloth ) so it drip dry into sink . thats just me . unit charges overnight they tell you not overcharge it beyond . it blinks while charging then stops after its charged . they says its good something like 40 uses , which i'll surprised if thats true . i'd happy if it lasted 20 1 minutes sessions . i've used it 5 times thus far . using hydrabrush consists holding unit two fingers ( loosely ) then biting down somewhat brushes letting it glide down your teeth somewhat its own . you push pull it somewhat , but you don't angle or work brushing technique all . this truly gadget which could turn us all into brushing idiots . this quite strange , but seems pretty easy it hard imagine people hard time using it , after adjusting its strangeness . small amount toothpaste i put into each brush seems get stuck take little extra cleaning remove after brushing . maybe i'm not putting right . owners manual makes it sound like toothpaste ' optional ' -- strange . feeling i get after using hydrabrush -- " wow , my teeth feel really clean " . i don't think my back molars ever brushed this much vigor before . i guess real test ( comments i get ) my next dentist appointment . update : bleeding gums long since stopped hydrabrush still going strong original ( first ) charge . i'm very impressed brush , it appears doing good job my teeth . i'm hoping good comment my dental hygienist my next visit . i've also using waterpik ... its also very good product . no , i haven't tried extra reach brushes . since my teeth badly worn down childhood grinding , i fugured my teeth too short require those brush heads . i think i'm getting plenty coverage basic heads , but i could see how people better teeth ( taller teeth ) could require extra reach heads . hydrabrush finally run out power initial charge -- i would say i got good 2 weeks charge , if not more . one minor concern come up after using hydrabrush , amount noise it makes , esp . when using bedtime , when others might already asleep . it gets louder more drained batteries get , so it might more motor strain noise than anything . i've noticed fully charged batteries more quiet . i'm still impressed how good this makes my teeth feel after only 1 minute brushing . i believe its time i write review amazon , not i've some time use this product . i would add hydrabrush would probably not so great little kids , since brush itself quite big might too much little pallete , little teeth . probably ages 10+ would appropriate . update : i since switched high speed setting . i would also say ( me ) this product , like water pik , tad messy requires you brush over sink , so water toothpaste drop into it while brushing . it not major amount , but i find controlled ' drool ' while brushing almost necessary , unless you stop middle . i just drool complete it 1 minutes or less . i advise using included rubber ( waterproof sheath ) included , it keeps water running down onto handle while use . since unit not fully waterproof , using this mandatory my mind . i buy this see if this device " real " , or just infomercial gimmick ... but i'll say , it real ... if you go into it open mind some flexibility little noise mess ... this really nice job your teeth . replacement heads cheaper than sonicare well . four pack really two complete replacement sets . two pack single replacement set	1
this radically different toothbrush , but it didn't take me long get hang using it properly , my teeth feel cleaner then they ever before . i really am glad i bought it	1
these things work . once you figure out how use them . all you carefully hold each end finger tips , using nuckle each finger raise or lower lip , center lay strip across teeth . use your finger nail tuck into spaces each tooth , making sure keep fingernail space tooth you just tucked before you move onto next space or tucking it into one pull last one out . once you it couple times , it smooth sailing then . i not think you find whitener this easy use this reasonably priced , actually works very , very well . i'm smiling you right now so you see what i mean . ;] , impressed aren't you ? i know i i definetely buy this product again . i also recommend it all my friends who not bright smiled i now am . your self favor -- get this ! kim schil	1
decent nail brush . i purchased it clean out assorted grime accumulates after day construction , it fairly well . i wish it stiffer bristles , also some problems grimy water getting inside body brush , it constructed two pieces popped together . this not issue anything but aesthetics , however , it not effect function brush .	1
we bought rechargeable batteries all sizes use wide array baby gear our son . we these particular batteries his swing crib light music toy , they last weeks charge . these definitely save us money long run less wasteful than single-use batteries	1
this wooden foot roller massageris excellent product . it lightweight , inexpensive , provides easy way simultaneosuly relax rejunvenate tired , achy feet . it wide enough roll both feet it , let acupressure balls work their magic .	1
bought this razor my husband christmas . i looking something replace battery-operated aramis he used years very disappointed when it finally stopped working . he loves this new braun pocket go ; used it almost exclusively since he got it . it not only excellent job - which you might not normally expect battery-operated razor - but it perfect size . thanks , braun	1
so far , these fit bill . just used them first time -- find they easy put , comfortable -- better yet , don't interfere jewelry they would if they hung off chain/rope/string	1
i've used it past 7 years i still get compliments way i smell ... so , i keep buying it ..	1
i waited couple weeks write this review so i could let my face get used new razor . background : i used norelco rotary shavers since i began shave teen . my skin always sensitive any time i tried non-rotary shaver my face would become red irritated . i also felt i getting closest electric shave possible rotary shaver . sometimes i go several days without shaving much i liked rotaries , they not well heavy beard growth . switch : whenever blades needed replacing my rotary shavers i would buy whole new razor . price replacement blades almost much shaver itself . my most recent norelco served me well but recent months shaving became dreaded experience . norelco uses motor rather than vibrator like most other shavers it tend slow down when blades dull beard thick . decision : although i never luck non-rotary shavers i tried friend braun once surprised how much closer it shaved how my face felt good afterward . his cheap $29 model i would happy it , but i liked style model 5775 . anything more expensive seemed just more gimmicks . i simply cannot see what would justify over $100 electric razor . review : this closest shaving razor i ever owned it actually makes shaving pleasure . wider head way various slots arranged lets me shave gliding razor over my face . no pressure needed . bad : it feels big heavy ( which taken positive ... feels remarkably well built ) . swivel head pure gimmick . it doesn't swivel during normal shaving seems useless . braun could made shaver smaller , lighter fewer parts prone break if they left " feature " off . highly recommended - excellent value .	1
one best shavers braun made long time many options use . you use it just like it , brush it out then rinse hot water . option you purchase clean charge stand . also you purchase 12 renewal pack which comes cutter block foil , 12 cartridges your clean charge stand . also they make two cases 5775 , one square soft case they also make hard case . you buy protective cap foil , clean out brushes . i using braun shavers over 50 years . i presently own 5775 model braun i highly recommend it anyone .	1
i purchased this use desk chair my office work . i basically interested heat feature . heat massage turn off after 15 minutes . this described safety precaution but it highly annoying re-set everything every 15 minutes .	-1
shaver great price . it provides very close comfortable shave . no problems . i not checked battery life yet , but soon	1
used variety shavers remmington , norelco braun , panasonic es4025sc far best yet . most obvious improvement how quiet unit operates . others sound like buzz-saw , but you barely hear this one . it especially effective body hair , but also works well facial head hair thicknesses . panasonic also never bites , often occurs other shavers . unless they discontinue this model , i never buy different shaver again	1
shaver fantastic , most reviewers agree . however , after two months gentle use , cleaning stand stopped working . braun telling me send it repair shop but , luck would it , i can't find my receipt so i can't get it repaired under warrantee . even if i could find receipt , i would send stand my expense . i bought this shaver because i felt i would buying quality . i am product designer profession i feel this product not worth money , especially light their repair policy . if they stand behind their products , i would fine this failure , but , it stands , i regret buying this shaver i doubt i purchase anything else braun	-1
this product works great , i use it while pregnant . it not contain dea which studies showing may cause cancer interfere fetal brain development . i love smell too !!	1
fountain pen well balanced elegant look it both modern yet timeless . only drawback i would preferred finer nib - med nib flows nicely very even never skips but would liked finer line . too bad it not offered option	1
reviewed using cross converter waterman florida blue ink : inexpensive copier paper , this pen medium point writes smoothly wet , never skipped . it starts instantly after days capped , weighted sized perfectly adult man , excellent grip . converter screw-in , safety deal all converters should use . section barrel threads metallic finished - if not all metal - threads not too loose or fine . very slight closed-cap looseness doesn't effect performance . posted , it looks much more expensive than it , current amazon prices ! lifetime warrantee .	1
i really like this dryer . it dries faster than most leave my hair softer than my previous blowdryer . it takes moment or two it heat up , but never gets so hot it would burn me . i love two attachments able complete 3 types styles without problem . only negative ( others mentioned ) " cool " button . it not uncommon fingers rest it while styling then all my heat gone . it need better usability testing	1
wow i no idea id saying this but after reading reviews when i purchased this item , after i received used it more than 2 weeks now ... they werent kidding ! this thing dries ur hair really well fast without leaving it dry !!! my hair looks healthy soft throughout whole day . must-buy if ur looking hair-dryer	1
amazon asked me review it because i ordered it . however , i never received it since it seems permanently out stock . so i ended up canceling my order . note . i 5 year old almost identical oxyjet irrigator which excellent although i repair its leaking plastic tube . i also same toothbrush which excellent too . note . i also half dozen other oral irrigators . oxyjet far best . note . ultrasonex better toothbrush . it hard find these days	1
i used various oral irrigation products over twenty years oral oxyjet dlx 8900 far best	1

i really like this scent . it light feminine . also , i like price . you get pretty big bottle price .	1
aside lightening fast shipping , i must rave over this scent ! initially , i knew i loved this perfume ( before my amazon purchase ) sample ad magazine . december , while walking through department store my boyfriend , i decided test fragrance gather his opinion . he didn't seem interested time , so i delayed making purchase . few weeks ago i finally broke down ordered it through amazon . i already run through 1/4 bottle , my boyfriend loves it ! yea	1
this classic fragrance , not your overpowering j-lo , b'spears , etc . i wish i could explain scent ... but it tough describe . it isn't fruity or flowery . perhaps bit lavendar though ? basically , you don't overpower room it . it bit " old-world " -ness it ... but far i am concerned , wonderful thing . i am 31 year old professional , i wear it daily out night , i just love it .	1
this item seems work every bit well much more expensive oral power brushes . i see no reason spend $50 -$90 . even more expensive sonic brushes may worth it , but this one great job	1
it great not tired arm after brushing my teeth . less than quarter time it gets off sticky film i when i'm lazy brushing my teeth . it so good i don't feel bad when i don't floss daily . i'm saying way too much my dental habits aren't i ? it also useful feature signals when you brushing ( around 2 minutes it jumps off couple times ) which helps make sure i get my whole two minutes . charge lasts enough not annoying . but every couple days you test it out listen whether it rotating fast day before .	1
ok , i must warn you i may sound like infomercial , but i am hooked this product my acne problems . i tried proactiv , murad , acne kit i can't think name addition separate topicals ( e.g. noxzema , clearasil , etc . ) none given me results this product gives . i even tried milder version acne free system didn't good results i get severe acne free system . i wouldn't recommend this product those dry or sensitive skin acne . this very drying formula works my very oily face . i never thought my acne severe , but i would always big zit one place or my face would leave big scars after zit went away . now , i not breakout since using this product ( 3 months ) . i hope it works you !	1
charge time quick charged batteries sustained their charge well reasonable period time	1
they garbage bags , so how worked up you get	1
i find these trash bags extremely useful . they really " grip " well ; i no longer any trouble bag falling into when i add something heavy . long you use standard tall kitchen trash lip , it should work just fine . only beef i this bag when i tie it cinched-up ties , it doesn't completely seal up . there always small opening center	1
i am new using oils but these very interesting . just couple drops trick . i especially like lavendar . there enough bottles last long time . 6 fragrances there plenty variety . recomend	1
i'm so happy output . my roommate returned his " bigger one " , bouhgt this one after me . he felt same great output . it also quiet . tank small handy but because high output , it not work more than 6 hours one tank water . i just shut off it before sleep	1
i very sensitive skin , so i am always reluctant try new skin care products . i end up returning too many because impact my skin . this product not only not irritate my skin , it also helped minor ingrown hair issues , good moisturizer well . scent product minty manly , my humble opinion . all all , product worked well me , someone very sensitive skin	1
clock this product not work . light not shut itself off . these both things description said it should . only thing it stay semi-fogless . this rip off , not buy	-1

i quite few thermalon heat wraps am very satisfied them -- good moist heat . i use one back one neck several times week . they've improved waist ties back one so they sturdier . i've given back wrap my sister , my father girlfriend they all like it too . p.s. i always wondered if these review real -- this my first	1
times , this product godsend . if your child fussy you don't know why , just try it .	1
i've worn this fragrance 3or 4 years now , but they no longer sell it stores . i extremely excited find it amazon really decent price well . shipping fast , i chose free shipping sometimes take up month but i recieved my package within week . so glad full bottle again . i love this fragrance	1
replacement blades work very nice provide uninterrupted ionic air cleaning . replacement blades actutally shinner then original blades much easier clean . i usually run my ionic pro replacement blades when they dirty i put original blades long enough clean replacement blads properly , then put replacement blades back .	1
i am very happy close shave this shaver , my previous shaver braun this gives me closer shave less time . it also very quiet operation . my only knock owners manual says charger needs unpluged after charging complete . this quite inconvient .	1
i'm almost 50 using electric razor most my shaving life . when my trusty norelco needed replacing , my wife bought me latest self-cleaning braun christmas gift . i liked some aspects it , but it always hard time shaving my neck area without going back over it lot times . replacing cutter screen every 6 months or so helped keep it getting progressively worse , but after couple years , i thought i would try something different . i read many reviews decided try norelco spectra system . i've using it several months now i tell you difference my neck like night day . norelco much faster smoother than braun cuts very close after only couple passes . i amazed how much better it than even my old triple-head norelco . if i any negative , it would charging system . first problem , if you provide recharging " stand " , then logic ( imo ) should stand allowed plugged 24/7 razor it , without any adverse affects . however , many places manual tell you doing this shorten life your battery . because they use nicad battery , they ask you only recharge it when it runs low avoid " memory " effect associated diminished capacity . i understand , but second problem , it gets fully charged only 4 hours ! after , you supposed remove it , or unplug , stand avoid overcharging . unfortunately , most us shave morning before work day , then don't return least 9-10 hours . my case , 12 or even 24 hour charge would far more convenient . what so hot " 4-hour charge " anyway ?? ok , how i push button start charge cycle , it automatically shuts off when fully charged ! how easy ? ( gee , that exactly how my braun worked . ) electrical engineer myself , i'm sometimes overly critical things like this . ok , if it me , ( you listening norelco ??? ) i would used nimh battery didn't " deep cycled " , then use lower current " trickle charge " base could left 24/7 . side benefit when you pack trip grab your razor , you know it always 100% charged probably enough juice last entire trip without dragging charger . ok , maybe charger not bad i make it out . i just think it could better . i give it 3 stars , while razor itself gets full 5 stars	1
far best thermometer i ever used . i wish i this when my boys little . i don't even bother ear or under arm versions my little girl - such waste time you always doubt accuracy . so simple . so fast . there isn't chance this thermometer inserted too far . excellent product . i highly recommend this all my friends	1
this best , fastest rectal thermometer market . it accurate , safe ( you literally can't insert it too far ) , very fast . i've used five other rectal thermometers , some which cost much more than this one , i say this one best . look no further	1
i originally bought this item use tub cushion while i sit tub giving my infant bath , but it wonderful , very comfortable great just relaxing tub yourself , it could also used regular seat cushion if you so choose . i like it very much	1

homedics bpw-200 smart sense automatic wrist blood pressure monitor works every time without giving us any frustrating error messages . it super easy switch one user graphic displays easy read very intuitive user(s ) . nice appearance , well made , seems very reliable accurate blood pressure readings . we extremely well satisfied highly recommend product	1
i honestly say these only tweezers you ever need . i 900 other pairs when i misplace these , my eyes well up tears thought losing them . freelance makeup artist , i lot eyebrow grooming . these tweezers wonderful very precise . i reach microscopic hairs , you only see 10x lighted magnified mirror , these babies . these tweezers also fantastic splinters , ingrowen hairs , tackling zits ( which you shouldn't doing . . . tsk tsk ) . careful ! they're sharp	1
i absolutely love this lounger . it most comfortable one i've ever owned , design allows me lie face down without smashing my nose or twisting my neck . i even read while lying face down . pillows arranged fit my individual needs held place velcrow . i little trouble folding lounger up single-handedly , but that okay . great features outweigh this minor annoyance .	1
i bought this my son college here his comments : " razor works great . it closest shave i able obtain eletric razor . cleaning base great idea , because it all work you , only thing you remember put it base . my only complaint my base male plug broke off . it probably just random chance accident it happened mine . they repairing it now i am supposed new unit soon , so phillips good . all all very great razor , especially sale price $50 ! "	1
i bought this shaver not long ago i really like it . where you find good shaver this amazing price .	1
i found i could not get close shave , if i working i would shave later day get . luckily i am retired so no problem . i also cannot cut some beard lower part my neck use trimmer cut any long hairs . not good my old norelco .	-1
we bought chrome model replacement basic no-frills showerhead . showers feel pretty good regular setting , massage setting decent too . showerhead easy install everything included except teflon pipe tape which we found necessary prevent leaks when we screwed this into main plumbing . when head resting cradle , it arches up few inches , which makes it nice tall people under . hose also plenty long enough reach other end tub . problem we showerhead not fit snugly into cradle , unless we unnaturally force it . just setting showerhead cradle results showerhead moving when water turned , mostly because hose still curl it . he solved this problem 2 hair clips hold hose still . one word caution -- if you unscrew swivel piece , careful not lose rubber ring , because it falls out easily . without it , swivel leaks badly . all things considered , i would buy this product again , would suggest it long it going used solely hand-held showerhead or solely cradled showerhead . switching back forth may cause frustration	1
i using this cream two weeks or longer quite honest , i don't see any change all . i am very disappointed would not buy this product again	-1
i used this product approx . 3 years now i much prefer it lotion . it works better me i heavy beard it greatly reduces irritation . i use this product until i either change razors or they make something better	1
everytime i purchase this product it never fails me when i shave . it great smelling aroma , it smooth face	1
great tasting bar . nice soft make it easy eat	1
its sooo good . yummy , filling , natural . what more could you ask	1
these great baby meal times , especially when road or travelling . no need cart sticky bibs around or worry washing them ; bibsters convenient job well	1
i tried small box these first , i loved them . this box 4-pack it great saves you money . they perfect because : - you don't clean them . just throw them away . - they way more comfortable my baby than vinil or plastic ones . - they velcro closing ( no sticky band catching baby hair ) . - 2 or 3 these take almost no space diaperbag . - they big enough cover her chest tummy . - liquids don't get through , so baby clothes stay dry . - pocket catches all food doesn't make it mouth . this great , specially now she starting eat herself only half spoons make it mouth . rest just falls pocket	1
i gotta admi t--t he concept great . you drive , you sit nicely cushioned seat cover also : 1 . massages your upper back , lower back , or both , 2 . optional heating unit comfort warmth , and3 . plugs into your auto cigarette lighter . massage conducted though 5 vibrating balls located inside cushion , therein , literally , lies problem . ball located center upper part cushion digs -- annoying , uncomfortably , very noticeably -- into your back , rendering whole massage/comfort angle moot point . well rest this works , it ( heat perceptible , other four balls feel fine , cushion fits snugly around your seat velcro-closed belt ) , one protruding ball makes this uncomfortable experience . i'm taking mine back . positive side , company just one " point " away very good product . if you see this ( or something like it ) , try " test drive " it store . maybe this company ( or others ) place balls better position other products . few other notes : you cannot turn heat independent massage ; , if massager not , you cannot turn heater . also , this not shiatsu-like massage , not this price . you're getting electricity-generated vibration here , two speeds , low high . high speed , you feel more stimulated than relaxed , if somehow one those old vibrating foorball game surfaces up against your back . fact , brief manual accompanying bk-2500 cautions people against using this night , it may keep you awake little while . still , if you like back buzz , you find similar cushion without very uncomfortable center ball ( didn't anyone test this thing ? ) , you might enjoy product like this . but ... not this one .	-1
my back itches time time . scratching one place often makes spot next it itch . somewhere during this process , it reaches somewhere hard reach , you end up looking like primate . use tools , feel human . i , however cut wheely things off back end . pointless , make product overly long awkward . i bought two ; one home one work . best $10 ( w/ shipping ) i'd ever spent	1
norelco seems moving lot its production electric razors china . i one made there , also this one which still made holland . truthfully , they both seem work equally well , but there issomething nice norelco land created them . no matter where they're , they pleasure use	1
i am really glad i purchased this item . weight very accurate i love it gives weight tenth pound . body fat similar past measures i've taken professionally . water , i tend get dehydrated , so i wasn't surprised mine low , but can't attest how accurate it . ( not even really sure what you use measure ) . setup fairly easy operation easy all information it gives . i would more user friendly only step scale , but i think it worthwhile it store your information . i would never need track 12 people , but i love it stores people information separately . overall , i think this great buy especially price would recommend it anyone needing scale calculates body fat	1
i like this scale . it light . it looks good my bathroom . it seems accurate . it memorize height weight information multiple users , so you your family members use it get your percent water percent fat , addition weight	1
these items arrived time described . rayovac rechargeabe batteries aa aaa sizes always worked great me . they keep their first charge even longer than regular batteries so they sometimes outlast them before even needing recharge . i wish larger size rayovac rechargeables good performers aa aa	1
hasta ahora las he estado usando en mi creative muvo tx fm me han servido . es una l�stima que no vengan con mayor amperaje . he visto que las energizer son mas potentes que estas . talvez sea porque las ray-o-vac salieron primero al mercado ..	1
unlike first review this product , i found it great take me whenever i go out eat . it folds down easily fits my purse . i read both paperbacks hardbacks using easi-reader few problems it . only times it seems slip when you just starting or ending book most pages one side holder . i always people coming up me my table asking holder i give it glowing recommendation . i tell them how track it down internet no idea how many i sold company . i orderded more than 20 myself given many them christmas stocking stuffers . i also given many people who work restaurants i frequent they asked holder i used them tips sometimes . i'm sorry other reviewer not find it useful but i really like it stated previously find it excellent my purposes	1

this energy drink really good . ignore reviewer gave it 3 stars because his body could not get used guru all natural buzz . if you fill your body unhealthy artificial [ ... ] then try guru , your body might freak out . after training your body guru natural ingredients , you won't worry jump-off-a-cliff effect unnatural energy drinks . guru soft buzz definitely picks you up early morning , no matter how early you get up . i work 7am shift need get up around 6 . somedays , my brain too comatose morning i need guru start day . somedays , one guru not enough i take half second make it through day . 98% time , one enough . very soft buzz end day . don't drink guru after 4pm or it might keep you awake night . drink tastes like soda water , but sweeter makes your tongue tingle . definitely not feel like soda pop . much healthier too . people should start using guru popular bar drinks instead rolling . much safer sanitary . consider your options - natural better you long run ! i'm giving drink 4 stars because i am field testing drink long run . jury still out b/c i've only using guru 3 months now . good luck your field tests	1

i norelco accutrim beard moustache trimmer t765 little over year before i lost charger . after looking one both town ( san diego ) internet , i decided just buy new trimmer all together . this point , i began some research . originally , i looked exclusively norelco trimmers though my rational solely based name recognition . after reading many reviews comparing prices , i decided look other brands well . when i came across panasonic er224s . reviews this product overall excellent , price appealing well : only 5 dollars more than my old norelco when bought best buy . before we proceed , i should let you know i am more beard growing enthusiast than beard growing professional . while i growing beard year now , i don't now , nor i ever aspirations zz top caliber beard . said , my needs , this beard trimmer everything i could hope . this trimmer improves over my old norelco so many ways . adjustment setter 14 settings beard length up 20 mm over 9 setting my old norelco offered , setting becomes locked once you power trimmer . there additional detail trimmer offers flexibility my old norelco could never offer , it hides away when you aren't using it . er224s also allows you operate trimmer while it charging . this something drove me nuts concerning my old norelco . it just quiet any other trimmer out there my opinion , it best looking trimmer you buy . it simply looks classy . it doesn't built-in vacuum , but i really don't see necessary . what i read , they most often break or performance sub-standard . grand scheme things , how difficult it rinse out sink after you ? trimmer also rather easy clean . manual very thorough explaining ins outs trimmer . fact , only con i think this product rather large charger . however , i trim my beard 2-3 times week , charge seems keep quite some time . overall , i am very happy this purchase	1

i written poor review previously , based only fact it seemed take forever heating pad arrive after i ordered it . time i got it , i no use it therefore couldn't rate actual product . well , company saw my review wanted make it right , so they refunded expedited shipping i'd paid , which considerable . i appreciate customer service like , especially when i didn't even " demand " it . luck - or whatever - would it , i need heating pad this week . dr. thinks i pulled ligament my back , i don't know . all i know it killed me , so i pulled out my handy new product gave it test ride . i love size it , it heated up lot more satisfactorily than my tiny drugstore one i'd using , delivered nice consistent heat . i also like weight it - resting my other side laying pad across injured part , it felt secure comfortable . i like it digital read thermometer , well timer automatic shutoff . ( i'd actually burned my arm my tiny drugstore model , whose pad inside flannel covering plastic - fell asleep it me my arm must've rested plastic part accidentally - i think i gave myself 2nd degree burn !... all better now tho . ) so , kudos company product . highly recommend .	1
i bought this heating pad chronic back pain after trying many other cheaper brands . out box heating pad feels good . its heavy appears well built . it digital readout which shows current temperature allows you set desired temperature treatment time . default starting temp . 124 . which short period feels too hot . this maybe because once heating pad reachs 124 it turns off . but temperature readout shows 132-134 . once unit shuts off when it reaches its target temperature , it cools off very quickly far sensation heat your body . but temperature readout stay very high even though pad feels cool . so you continually turning temperature pad up , so feel warmth . 15 20 minutes you reach maximum temperature you set heating pad , then unit stops heating your . i tried laying unit out flat walking away . after 15 minutes temperature still reads 142 . this problem this pad . what ever measures temperture this pad so very very slow react , unit unable deliver steady heat . this regard its " same old " , no better delivering heat than $10 heating pad . also , forget using pad darkened room unless you take flashlight . digital read out no backligh t.t he pad deliver its promise moist heat	-1
some ways , this more comfortable than mouth guard i got my dentist because it doesn't cover all my lower teeth . other ways , it less comfortable because it very flexible move out place . i like adjustable sides , though . overall , i'm happy it because it lot less expensive than custom-fitted dental device . it keep me biting down my teeth night , which means i no longer am waking sore jaw . minty flavor pretty apparent first , but now i hardly know it there . so it really doesn't matter what flavor you buy	1
i started grinding my teeth night while studying bar exam ( yeah , guess you could say i stressed ... ) . i went through 2 different models boiler mouth guards ( you boil mold , bite it , then immerse water set it ) but really didn't like them , they seemed flimsy . ultimately , i found this sleepguard model online tried it out . it soooo much better ! instead fitting over all you teeth , it just creates overall gap keeping your back molars apar t.t his model keeper . i don't use it anymore because i stopped grinding after exam - either because stress gone or because this trained me not ... but whatever case , if i buy one again , it would definitely this model . i very very pleased it .	1
i bought this product myself 6 weeks ago . i waited this long before writing so i could honestly say if it worked or not . i've used other bite guards leary purchasing one said it would " fit right out box " , but i pleasantly surprised . it actually fit , no boiling or adjusting . it flexible yet firm enough so i don't grind . i never buy any other kind after this one . i highly recommend this product	1

once we finally got this table put together , we loved it . not much say other than it pretty sturdy good quality . but ... i think we would much easier time assembling it if we simply thrown instructions away solved it like puzzle . instructions vague , error ridden , omitted important parts steps . this manufacturer really needs thoroughly test , update , edit their assembly instructions . i believe tables made states , so it not translation issue	1

( ever notice how permeable artificial flavors ? let say you're eating popsicle -- excuse me -- frozen fruit treat . you close your eyes , flavor clues all but gone . think purple , its tastes like grape ; think orange , it orange , think light blue it bubble gum -- if you know code , . ) this like giant bit-o-honey candy , it chewy texture over laden honey , some sticky peanut butter chocolate thrown , you've pretty much captured flavor . my surprise , there no honey , taste derives somehow syrups , malt , cane juice , fig paste , other sweet ingredients . it definitely filling , especially if accompanied apple or something , least eight ounces water . it very chewy , yet it doesn't seem dry similar products . could it six grams fa t-t wo which saturated ? yes , two grams saturated fat ! not good . i'll try balance fact it made 70% organic ingredients , whopping 11 grams protein , only 20 grams sugar ( compare other brands flavors ) , includes five grams fiber . clif z-bar excellent clif apple raisin walnut , this one better tasting its kind -- just don't expect brownie	1

amazon notes these bags easy life carry -- they right . black color bags helps make your refuse more private , too . this important this day identity theft . bags drawstrings you should draw tight then tie ; but i recommend you also tie very top part actual black bag itself extra strength so it definitely won't break when you take out garbage . hefty lives up its name extra strong . i tried several store brands but none them thick durable hefty . my opinion hefty brand buy . 33 gallon capacity makes these garbage bags great both families single people . bags economical , too . amazon price they cost roughly 35 cents each that good deal especially because bag usually handle two days ' worth garbage . highly recommended .	1

i first received l'eau d'issey pour homme girlfriend who always immaculate taste , her choices all well received . but l'eau d'issey stands out one gets most comments - all positive - both friends total strangers . it actually become bit laugh my favorite starbuck because frequency women line offer favorable remark ( it happened once or twice others , victoria secret very sexy one i recall , but issey miyake way , way ahead respect ) . like one other reviewers , i men also ask it ( usually some disclaimer start ) . i carry refillable travel spritz when road since i consider this one my basics . it works well but appears leak bit volume - nothing major , it doesn't smell up my toiletry bag or anything else suitcase , but i'll usually run out longer trips .	1
i 12 colognes now this one among aqua di gio , burberry weekend scents - very light aquatic , making it suitable spring summer . issey miayke stands out crowd though , because it works your skin chemistry , until point where you can't smell it but others notice it quick whiff . yes , it last long long time , top , middle , low notes all work together create truly long lasting , quality cologne .	1

i replaced conair beard/mustache trimmer whose battery died , i've very happy it . i like fact it run power supply plugged , not option conair . i'm surprised negative comments other reviews , since i've never adjustable comb ( which controls how long it leaves your hair ) fall off . i agree one combs kit thin , but i like factor . i find it works well me when i'm washing my long hair shower . i use it dump most water prior toweling it dry . if you don't like kind comb , go spend buck or two good , stiff comb or three . i wear full beard often neglect shaving my neck cheeks days , trimmer no comb great knock down stubble before i shave it	1

this gift my husband he loves it ! it gives himthe closest shave he ever electric razor andvery similar regular shave . price best , too .	1
this my second braun shaver . first one lowest model one blade . i loved them becuase i never cut my face their foil design . newer one definitely superior its design though . two blades make it faster shave . it washable , longer run one charge . it not too noisy so i don't wake up whole house . it sturdy compact travel box . carrying charging cable not big problem since it also very compact . moreover it not necessary take cable most times , since one charge most likely last longer than your trip . however braun design some limitations . first all , foils not sturdy . they bend lose form if you not careful where you put shaver it falls into sink instance . nice thing replacement foils available everywhere , affordable . problem foil design it extremely hard shave if your face moist . you'll wait bathroom dry up if you want shave after shower , since water vapor stick your face otherwise . even more important ( now i am re-experiencing , every year ) , humid summer day you need push shaver your face , since there no way dry skin . maybe it better fall back traditional razor such days , but i hate cutting myself so i just stay my braun . all put aside , i find one thing awkward . small button pops foil cleaning placed just bit above on/off button . sometimes ( when i'm not fully awake ) i accidentally push it see foil hit sink . so far ( after 3 years ) nothing happened foil because this , since it extremely light . but it still not best placement buttons . trimmer worked fine me . many people complaining it . so i'll try complain too . only thing i don't like trimmer space trimmer shaver hard reach brush cleaning . i guess i am too picky this last commen t.t o sum up , i love my braun shaver . it reliable long time . i'd give 4.5 stars if it possible	1
o.k. you buy cheap batteries , but not this razor . they nipple thats 3/8 " long fits up into razoryou cannot use conventional battriesin this razo	1
i bought this massager my husband who back leg pain . he panasonic massager 21 years finally gave up ghost , so we knew brand excellent . programs included massager especially helpful neck back which give him relief pain . only drawback sound it makes -- reminds him sounds mri . would definitely recommend it !	1
it such simple idea . take manual razor electric razor create hybrid electrical manual razor cheap price . forget buying any kind electrical razor or manual razor again . this thing works using single aaa battery ( worth investing some rechargable aaa batteries ) which slips into base pulling out end piece . just press green button razor starts vibrate . this vibration stimulates skin gets those hairs prick up little bit so razor blades ( all three baldes , i.e - mach iii/m3 ) catch better creating cleaner smoother cut . honest old mach iii model absolutely great but m3 power razor just upgrades razor into totally new device . there simply nothing market remotely resembles this kind product ... nothing . i would not hesitate sending anyone down local drug store $20 pick up this wonderful product ... quite frankly ... just making shaving enjoyable again	1
i knew when i bought this body fat monitor would just used rough estimate what actual number , so i wasn't really altogether surprised when i found out it 10% off . but , let face it , sensors feet which poor tester body fat percentage . great scale track your weights two different people based age height scale . i really impressed . i like this scale but it might more bells whistles than necessary might lead people astray believing they body fat higher or lower base their body fat percentage this machine alone . if you buy this product , just know it good place learn approximately where you but sure go gym or doctor it correctly	1
this toothbrush awesome !

i bought this item local grocery store . it great encouraging good eating habits ! it just right size keep cut up vegies dip fridge bring out each meal . we like it so much , we going buy least 4 more ( one each hubby i take work , cut up fruit home , third my sister who really likes ours ) . unfortunately store i bought first one doesn't them anymore , so i'm thrilled find them here amazon	1
this actually beautiful fountain looks much better than picture amazon . although it made plastic , it looks quite good much better than artificial grey slate type fountains . other reviewers mention , pump really quiet there nice flow water soothing when room quiet . i wind chimes outside two together very soothing . this fountain lights up lovely yellow illumination . dark room it quite attractive fits into even very upscale decor . cost them item low overall i think my 5 rating well-deserved	1
not much say besides fact they long life . i use them my boombox it sounds sane if i'me plugged into wall socket . i use these bateries all time	1
get this wonderful heating pad . you won't regret it . heats up fast very reasonable	1
i like cottonelle , but i prefere packages fill one container each , rathar than these larger packages	1
this stuff best !!! absolute must nursing moms !!!	1
this best cream i ever used . suggest it anybody .	1
i tried other less expensive brands , pampers still best one . these soft absorbent even overnight . overall , great product	1
my 2 yrs daughter likes dora prints this so much she chooses wear this pull ups rather than elmo pampers cruiser or underpants ( she now potty training ) . absorptivity wise easy ups not good cruiser	1
replacement heads norelco razor makes great shave . i haven't used electric razor years , figuring you could not get close shave . i wrong . norelco shaver awesome	1
desciption not mention product not used url coated lenses , which serious omission given many or even most eyeglass lenses coated	-1
use this face scrub pretty much every other day before bed also use nivea men face wash other days . i've using this routine year now my skin never looked better . after using face scrub my face felt comletely clean soft . i highly recommend this product	1
i love this heating pad . it so great heat up bed before i go sleep . i am able defrost my icy feet sleep soooo comfortably . best part it goes off after two hours so i don't worry burning my feet or burning down house . this second one i purchased . i first one many years i guess it just wore out . i used it almost every night colder months . i wish i not thrown it away because i found it it came very long warranty i might able replace it . this time i'll know	1
i would rated it five star , except control made overly complicated . i think ten settings heat then many settings how many hours two , four , six hours or continuous --- why make it so diffcult operate . instuctions , goodness , almost useless !	-1
this very inexpensive fountain i don't think it would realistic compare it other much more expensive models . it made out plastic , but it blend into decors easily long it not very close viewer . lighting quite beautiful you adjust flow water . price , i am quite happy it not think it much nosier than other more expensive models . pumps usually all same or very familiar . however , it very important keep water level up distilled water . if you don't this you get ruin pump , make it run nosier because wear , etc . i think it great fountain office or mood lighting bedroom . if you expensive furniture , you may want get something made out slate or better material .	1
it works just like it says like you would expect it . i can't ask anymore product	1
comparing multi-blade razors , mach iii best : far easiest clean , best balanced , most securely attached handle-to-head . these things -matter- , shaves otherwise fairly equal . if you must : i used double-edge ' safety ' razors years , before there -were- cartridges . if you tough hide , or master barber , fine , but regular guys continue get cut regular basis old style . mach iii shave you just close , you never get cut	1
1st wahl trimmer i purchased failed within few weeks . i posted my review amazon contacted soon after wahl representative . he offered opportunity change my opinion product sent me replacement unit free charge . i buy different brand trimmer when 1st failed but it wahl i depend everyday use . replacement trimmer doesn't cut short length i prefer . wahl 11 position guard more than adequate . i use level 1 cut that few days more than stubble look . i tried stubble guard but didn't really need it . battery life very good . i use trimmer 3-4 times week charge it after 3 weeks or so . it also used while it charged . i quite impressed someone wahl took time read user reviews their products personally respond . reason i purchased wahl trimmer because brand familiarity especially because my barber recommended it . my review based extended use replacement trimmer i am more than satisfied it . it less expensive than other brand i purchased it works great	1
my husband leaving more than 20 pairs reading glasses everywhere any where could still never find pair when he needed them .... even ead menu ! these glasses answer anyone who wears reading glasses . i bought them all colors him even bought pair work friend who works him(he loves them well bought more colors also ) . neither them lost pair all these months . they also started so many conversations . everyone who asked them same bought all colors . it takes little adjusting getting use but everyone we know never returned pair . only reason they returned order more colors or order friends loved ones ! these glasses fantastic ! thanks great service	1
i really enjoy my readers . i work health/computer field training among other things not worry carrying case when your arms loaded or misplacing them not able find them when needed . it so convenient just " click " them off when i'm . i asked them almost every where i go nurses work just love them . they very convenient .	1
i love idea glasses always where i find them . only problem they need also adjustable how wide band . every time i look up magnets pop apart . if they fix , i'd give them 5 stars !!	1
i really liked it first . it gave consistent readings clear easy understand . i wouldn't say i rough it all but somehow it broke . tab holds little door closed batteries broke off without any misuse .	-1
its easy use very clear instructions . got it delivered per scheduled time without any kind delay . thanks product	1
i use schick intuition razor . so , when gillette finally came out their version 2 1 razor , i excited try it . i like them both different reasons . intuition lasts longer my opinion cartridges less expensive . however , it bit bulky it difficult reach some areas . gillette breeze makes maneuvering more simplistic due it sleek style . moisture/shaving strips ran out after one shave . rate , it could become quite expensive replace blade . so - choice yours . which one fits your lifestyle best ? both products good 2 1 product makes my shaving experience bit more pleasurable less time consuming	1
i didn't personally use this but i bought it my mother who broken more expensive one . she said it worked perfect if not better than other one . she loved large display information it could hold 1 or 2 individual multiple readings . she especially likes all around automatic use . just touch one button machine inflate you . not complicated all . price excellent only $29.99 . i priced one wal-mart all auto-inflate digital blood pressure monitor cheapest they started $45 . very good buy amazon if i say so , well my mother	1
pros : handle weighted well . very close shave . less irritation than previous generations , even against grain . extra blade back = worth it . cons : 5 blades get gunked up quickly , requiring more passes . long surface area ( blade ) takes some getting used . expensive ; not compatible mach3 system . update :d own 2-3 stars . used razor two weeks found it not function well mach3 . if you not everyday shaver ( sometimes i don't shave weekends or holiday breaks ) you suffer significant beard-pull when you shave off those few days worth growth . also , i found i simply wasn't getting close shave i mach3 , even when shaving every day . i agree there less irritation , but only slightly so . i miss sideburn blade heft handle , but i'm happy i returned it purchased more blades my mach 3 power instead -- me , least , this wasn't improvement	1
nothing special report . toasty , no annoying auto-shutoff , cord plenty long	1
works advertised , except water phoenix so hard , i only get 3 uses instead 10 out cartridge . absolutely zero need towel dry car .	1
i like hot brush , i short hair which i blow dry use brush finish top . it quick , compact lets me finish quickly .	1
there no choice color shaver screen trim . one i replaced black ... new one i got amazon gray . it would nice know what color i getting , but not shown or selectable . other than cutter foil flawless , like all braun shaving products	1
this great product ! i first used this mirror my sister-in-laws house wrote down product number ... then went web . found amazon ! great those us over 50 yrs . old ! now i actually see put my makeup find my contacts when i lose one my eye ! my sisteen year old granddaughter loves well . i bought one her mother she " stole " it immediately telling her mom she needed it more ! we all love 5x mirror !	1
excellent precise trimmer , i even use it trimming sideburns . it , simply , best i ever owned .	1
my last set remington curlers , very similar this set , lasted over 10 years i very happy see they still made comparable model . curlers heat up quickly great job curling your hair . 2 different size curlers great different hair styles . i prefer original metal clips came my first set plastics ones this one not fit if you long hair . overall i would recommend this set someone shoulder length or short hair .	1
i've owned these curlers before . i tried some others before finding these amazon they didn't compare . you leave them 60 seconds or 5 minutes depending type curl you want . either way they always work great	1
it not worth $1.00 . you get better shave spoon . it no rpm . speed slow even when fully charged over 8 hours . blades not cut even little stubble . light no meaning , it tells you nothing battery supply or if it needs charged or running low . cord too short . good - battery last time , but how you tell .	-1
jut time i found best friend i look . amazing , friendly , powerful , excellent , brilliant , magnificent . i use it all time leave my face radiant . since i met this friend , i don't want continue any more friendship gillete razor . gillete razor my friend years , but norelco my princess now . wonderful !!! leave my face clean radiant . my motto : " clean face , happy face .	1
it good gift friends . i bought one my friend birthday gift , she likes it very much	1
once every two years i feel moved write positive review . this shaver incredible . i used high end norelcos years they what ford taurus too mercedes class ( panasonic ) . this real deal , some silly toy oozing gels nagging cleaning reminders . i noticed some reviewers still say they occasionally go back blade close shaves . i cannot imagine why . i run cleaning cycle every day no twin blade compare thorough 5 min shave this bad boy ( never used 3-4 blades ) . others mentioned , this shaver far less expensive other sites , but this good place review	1
it not often people take time write review something like electric shaver , but , this product truely deserves recognition . here what i found . i really tested them all ! i am very particular spending my hard earned something seems cheap or looks like it only cost $5 make overseas . so i generally tend gravitate higher/highest end product lines . i tested owned following:norelco newest speed xl 9170xlccnorelco spectra 8 james bond seriesnorelco cool shave nivea lotion dispenser built ( don't even bother!)braun 360 #8995 , made germany-their best model panasonic es8228 vortex nano triple blade hydrasystem ii - brookstone exclusive model but same es8168si tested all these over course 2 years . they all perform cleaning functions cleaning unit , or they rinsed under faucet . here resultsnorelco'snorelco newest speed xl triple blade system absolutely no better than spectra 8 ( james bond series ) or above . it may actually worse because smaller cutter sizes . it however provide comfortable shave norelco most known . it easy , smooth quiet . anyone use this shaver not get nicked . it pleasure hold almost makes you move circles which seems attack hair any angle . good - it just not shave close braun or panasonic . physics dictate , metal ringcups hold round blades just thick pull hair up clip hair below surface claimed . cleaning system huge not " intelligent " like braun . overall proven solid performer . braun 360 #8995this unit much better pivoting head design than past models very unique foil supposed grab hairs more effeciently - well , it definately provides closer shaver than previous models . this shaver however work . get really close shave you need follow their directions stretching pulling your skin tight . most guys this somewhat anyway , but really get close shave this unit expect work it , expect go over same area different directions . " bar " shaver just designed way , you provide attack path your beard . not bad things but certainly more work . expect get your closest shave after around 5 minutes leas t.t he braun loudest shaver bunch , fact annoying those house . motor truley slower than panasonic it shows . it clunky unit hold comparison norelco , panasonic . but , it definately shave closer than any norelco date . cleaning unit big bulky loud but very good job . replacement cleaner tanks way overpriced compared others . panasonic vortex nano system . i happen bought mine brookstone , yes i paid $50 premium their special color ( light beige/silver ) wood grain finger rests backlight lcd . it also smallest cleaning unit matches color shaver attractive . this keeps my wife happy since it not lot clutter , these cleaning units need stay put . true test closer shave amoungst unitsthere really only one way test units - shave 1/2 your face one unit , other 1/2 different shaver . i this many weeks . almost any shaver going feel pretty smooth after you first shave , you'll quickly notice which side closer end day or next morning . great test - i this too ! shave your face one brand , then immediately shave your face again unit . i absolutely guarantee these panasonic vortex nano shave you even closer after shave . you notice this " sound " your beard cut . it absolutely amazing !!! design engineering wins panasonicthree technologies seem completely advanced panasonic compared anyone else . they motor speed , 30 degree blade angle nano blade sharpening . here my results : 1 . fastest linear motor 13,000 rpm patented , it makes big difference . 2 . super quiet compared braun same norelco3 . entire head goes out pivots left right . this great because you push harder without fear ruining cutter foil or nicking yourself . 4 . cutter head slightly " curved " which makes big differnce when moving circular attack . 5 . no vibration incredibly speed , comfortable hold6 . cleaning unit small fast efficient . uses water much larger tank than anyone else cleaning detergent cartridge that lot less money than anyones . hey , anyone sell you alchohol cartridge , this much smarter , cleaner , more economical . 7 . while road , you clean unit simply pumping ordinary liquid soap onto head while it running , let it suds up , then rinse off let dry . how cool ! 8 . yes , it used shower if you want . these units well sealed well madewell , i hope helps you save time money . you could easily get this same unit amazon under different model just make sure it following : 1 . nano blade technology - much sharper polishing system their blades2 . vortex ( convex blades foil)3 . hydaclean system iimake shaving fun again , go buy one .	1
it nice . small strong . my father used this one 4 months .	1
it get tension stress out your muscles . worth just try it	1
size makes it easy directly pinpoint secific areas massage heat option die . only downside manual it says not use it more than 15 minutes continuously so motor doesnt overheat it numbs your hand after you use it strongest vibration setting . overall its great purchase someone occasional sore muscle exercise .	1
i bought this iron after reading some negative reviews here . i love it . i non problems others say they . my hair perfectly smooth after using it , which hard my thick , curly hair . i even friends try it they agree it awesome . it pricey , but worth it if you hard straghten hair	1
i fence spending money this iron i am glad i . i still dry my hair almost all way but i don't worry styling brush . iron might add minimal amount time getting ready but my hair never looked better . my hair wavy i driven my friends family crazy over years complaining how hard it style . i used curling irons flat irons straighten my hair -spent more time ok results . this product i love my hair . it looks straight but still body -like i paid professional my hair . your hair get caught plates if you too quick/careless but i think any iron	1
i love these glasses . they always there when i need them ... hanging around my neck ready me put them place . only problem i experienced related application i am using them ... my shop . i got 3.00 so i could good close up look when necessary . however , i've noticed when i'm actively working around project getting myself different positions related object my work , glasses often separate where magnets positioned bridge glasses causing me clear both hands tools or whatever them reconnect lenses . it exasperating , but you've got able see your work . this design flaw product clearly doesn't apply most people situation . some might argue my head just too big ! while i may big ego , my head actually slightly smaller than average . this problem could likely corrected manufacturer extending each temple one inch give glasses more room expand before breaking apart . but important thing you know i'd still buy these glasses all over again . they really terrific	1
whenever i am out i my glasses around my neck . funny thing when i go put them i pull them apart . this makes everyone jump ! thinking i just broke my glasses lol too funny . then when they see how they work they all want pair . i know i could spokes person this company . excellent product very well made i mine years no complaints ever	1
little bigger bulkier wider band than i expected but still comfortable effective . i seem sleep better when i use it .	1
this great , everyday shampoo . i fine hair i find it leaves it soft shiny , without weighing it down . it got great scent . i would definitely recommend this product . it worth it	1
job 50 bucks its great deal	1
i back/shoulder pain recently ordered this product two weeks ago . i really love it because it works great me . after couple runs rolling/kneading ( well , they call it shiatsu ) perfect pressure , my back feel relieved . cons : it too short reach my upper shoulder . suggest homedics redesign it , maybe hood shape allows massager roll upper shoulder lower back .	1
this shaver my first shaver i got it when i 15 . i really like it because it gives me close shave doesn't irritate my skin hardly all . trimmer side almost useles , but rest system outstanding . it doesn't take long charge hold charge long time . it great option anyone buy i highly recomend it	1
while i am far expert nutritional suppliments , this one seems work advertised ( although , all i know , it could also simply placebo effect ! )	1
i feel guilty just drinking this stuff . i got cookie cream i mixed it soy milk man , tastes like real thing , even cookie clumps . i actually enjoy drinking this shake before after my workout which weird first because it tastes sooo good !! only using it few days so i can't comment results just yet . i just post how this best tasting protein shake i ever tasted ! i strawberry milkshake way too . if you amazon prime , free 2-day shipping + no tax = can't beat price anywhere else . ordered wed morning got it thursday afternoon !	1
i always track my reps weight i lift , since taking muscle milk i've consistently outperformed my plateaus . i've great gains , i lift more , taste awesome ! i highly recommend it i'll definitely buying more	1
my friend used this razor two months he loves it . he enjoys smooth quiet close shave , loves trimmer , design . his only small complaint shave little slow his ultimate dream . however , he hyper type personality so i'm not sure razor slow since he everything super sonically . thanks norelco ! you made me look good	1
i've always wary electric razors , but i say this one works pretty well me . it took no time my face get " used " this razor ( past it hell try get through couple weeks other kinds ) . first day i used it i got nice , close shave no irritation . single charge lasts me couple weeks , so even though i've brought charger me when traveling i've never use it ( i'll leaving it home next time ) . i haven't actually used cleaning system yet , because you run entire razor under hot water clean it out no problem . i just leave it counter dry until i come home work . my only complaint would like most other people ( all other electric razors i know ) it doesn't get all those hard get hairs my neck without several passes , trimmer doesn't get close enough my sideburns . not problem though , i just keep disposable razor shower touch up --- just few seconds no lather so not big deal . i would recommend this product anyone looking make switch	1
unlike other reviewer , i love taste vanilla . but then , i mix it orange juice so it tastes like orange julius	1
i recently plesantly surprised get bottle light blue gift it totally made my day because i down last 1/5 my last summer bottle sooner i would bought new one anyway . this how much i love this perfume . talking mind reading ! thank you , dg , creating this refreshing masterpiece	1

perfectly honest this make my hair grow alot . im not really surprised because it contains alot amino acids which help hair growth naturally anyway . after month using it everyone i mean everyone saw difference length my hair . only advice i would give not take many pills it says take . they say bottle take like 3 pills day each bottle . which really my opinion not healthy so i only took 1 pill day each bottle- aminos , herbal other bottle . i took it like 3 weeks straight my hair shiny , long strong . when you take one pill day each bottle instead 3 not only it healthier but pills last longer lol . but it good investment	1
i chose this shaver after reading number owner reviews . after using it few weeks , i find it well deserving glowing comments those reviews , it far exceeds claims marketers . well , braun .	1
fast shipping , they kept me updated shipping status , product exactly described , excellent price , i`m very satisfied this purchase . keep up this excellent service guys !!!	1
i bought this toothbrush because it gold box savings needed replace my other oral . i am so happy it . my teeth feel " squeaky clean " after using it it doesn't " tickle " my gums like sonicare . it great battery life two different speeds . after few weeks , my teeth look whiter i lot less plaque my last dental appointment . my husband dentist started use more deluxe , but similar , version this ( digital timer , 4 speeds , some other aesthetic nuances ) also very pleased . fact , he likes it so much he starting give them away his new patients !	1
this unit great ! it well made , takes up minimal space , it gives me peace mind my toothbrush clean ! i also keep dental pick tongue scraper there well . i imagine my toothbrush getting tan everyday ... only thing i found , it it not fit sonicare head there . but it 3 small toothbrush holders one larger hole like wider handled tongue scraper etc ... i love it ! no bacteria hanging out my toothbrushes	1
i like way this cream gives instant glow noticed difference next morning too . mine dry sensitive skin cream works well . very nice smell	1

i using these flosser piks few years . waterpik flosser recommended my dentist because my teeth very close together traditional flossing takes lot time . waterpik flossers i'm able floss very quickly mornings . my teeth cleaning experiences much , much better now i use flossers .	1
i skeptical buying this first , but after seeing it allure , reading various reviews amazon , i decided try it . i say , i pleasantly surprised ; it what it says . it won't work cyctic acne or if pimple already come head . it work pimples just beginning .. those hard , tender knots deep under your skin you just know going huge day or two . i've used it two pimples red bumps , both mostly gone within 24 hours . completely gone less than 3 days . usually it would taken 7-10 days them go away , it would ugly	1
ok , let me preface this saying i am one biggest skeptics you'll ever meet . i don't easily fall new fads , miracle cures , or anything seems too good true . this said , i am completely love this product feel it helped boost my immune system 100% . unfortunately , i am not health-conscious i should . i am overweight , bit addiction mcdonald cheeseburgers , maybe exercise once or twice week . it all seemed catch up me last thanksgiving when i got hit cold . no big deal , i get them couple times year . then , right before christmas , i got cold . i very put-out , but just figured it my bad luck . february rolls around brings it cold #3 . i missed quite bit work getting very concerned something else might wrong . i developed slight fever , but it all went away one week . i hoped it all over i just unfortunate cold season . when i got back work , i spoke one my co-workers , " emily , " who self-proclaimed health-nut . she would always brag she " never got colds . " i would cringe tell her ) not tempt fate ) stop rubbing it . she swore this " green food " powder she drank every day her lemonade . it looked like finely cut grass , i assumed that what it . i told her she nuts , she hadn't gotten cold because she lucky , she ate really well , ran every morning . i let her fix me some powder tried mix it up my tea . it horribly , it felt like i drinking , well , finely cut grass . it didn't bad taste , but texture grotesque . i told her i'd take my chances . well , here comes march , it , new cold . this time i desperate . emily told me go health store look some green foods capsule form . i so , although i couldn't find brand she taking capsule form ( green vibrance ) , i find greens plus . it seemed lot similar ingredients , so i went ahead bought it ($40 ! ) . whatever , i figured this my last-ditch effort before hauling myself down doctor . i took 4 pills night , , i swear , woke up next morning feeling ok . it like i knocked my cold out before it really got started . i elated , but still not convinced . i sure it could coincidental , but after four months four colds , i really didn't care . i took 3 these pills every morning ( you take up 12 ) , colds didn't come back . twice since then , i've felt " scratchy throat " feeling you get when cold coming , i'll up my dosage 4 , twice day . i'm always fine next day . colds flying around my office , but emily i still ( knock wood ) healthy . i've since little internet research individual ingredients , but am still not sure what it helping . maybe it just placebo effect . i haven't any other benefits product claims like increased energy , stamina , etc ., but i also haven't gotten cold . i am faithful believer it now . maybe it just snake oil maybe it all due placebo effect . but seriously , i don't care . i haven't cold while , so i'm happy . i would recommend this product anyone .	1
i purchased these after seeing physician friend mine using them . i absolutely recommend these any active person who needs reading glasses ready . i clip them morning use them off throughout day never misplace them . i purchased these gifts other professional people . one pair i purchased bit narrow temples . i heated back band hair dryer gave them little side side pull , placed them they fit just fine . if you particularly large person this may necessary	1

i dealing w/ pain planters factitious while now . it pain stretch every morning or night , especially w/ full time job 2 children under 3 . however , i leave this thing next my bed stretch first thing am last thing pm it works very well . i first started using it while pt found all other stretches they me , this one seemed like most productive felt most effective .	1
naturally , my hair wavy , very thin strands but piles piles it . my hair somewhat difficult when it comes straightening -- usually it looks fine when i leave house , but comes completely undone after four hours . so , when my last conair straightener broke , i went out invested my money this one . overall , it okay . it straightened my hair one stroke , which rare me . however , it seemed just suck all moisture out my hair , leaving it extremely dry dull ( which definitely not good vegan such myself , since my hair already dry enough ! ) . movements clumsy this , i occasionally snagged my hair or burned myself due plates unexpectedly shifting toward me . it didn't break , it still going just strong day i first bought i t.t his straightener problems dealing smaller amounts hair , or fine " baby hairs " around my forehead . sadly , it couldn't keep my side bangs straight save its life -- they wavy ever two hours after i'd straightened it . this straightener most minimal job -- least it straightens your hair somewhat -- but save your pennies straightener more worthwhile .	-1

this metrx protein powders my favorites , though when amazon this brand stock it less expensive per serving than metrx . metrx foams up bit more seems little thicker ( not negatives , my opinion ); twinlab comes out very smooth when made blender . both brands taste very good , least when made fat free or 1% milk ( or very least half milk half water ) . i won't detail nutritional info because it available product description here , but like metrx i like this protein powder gets almost all its calories protein . some protein powders fair amount fat some lot carbohydrates . those formulas may good competition level bodybuilders who need extremely high caloric intake because they working out so hard , but i don't really want protein shake gives me meal worth carbs fat addition protein . i'd rather get my carbs fat real food	1

wonderful inhalation steamer sinus conditions . i plagued bad chronic sinus conditions past 16 years miserable . four surgeries still problems . countless antibiotics , steroid sprays tablets , etc . daily treatments morning evening mabis use neilmed sinus rinse saline packets finally given me my life back quite productive state again . mabis puts out very necessary copious amounts steam where other steamers i owned failed . key mabis concentrates steam where necessary , into nasal passages via small nasal mask . however , it would improvement if mabis would provide nasal adapter ( such nebulizers have)that directs steam straight into nostrils instead small mask which allows steam affect entire nose area . angled chimney inhaler makes it easier use . however , it too could improved use flexible tube or least little more angle so unit easier use while sitting upright instead hunch over . they should also include more than one misting orifice because saline mixes hard water tend clog very tiny hole mister . mabis supply small cleaning tool ( wire ) ream out clogged orifice . if you significant sinus trouble this unit best thing you find . i used several different devices including kaz ( no longer made ) , vicks ( too little steam not effective , facial type rather than sinus device ) . vicks vaporizer use towel(works but very hot brutal face ) . i used essential oils like cinnamon , clove , thyme , tea tree kaz unit obtained some relief but mabis saline mix really most beneficial . it doesn't cure anything but it sure brings some quality life back . i can't recommend this device enough . it very portable easily packed taken trips . i used it my van inverter recent long trip which very convenient . i also use it my sailboat . it utilizes very small amount water which makes it simple use mobile fashion . it easy clean well . i suffer 24/7 chronic sinus , countless doctors , taken all types meds , multiple surgeries this little machine tiny fraction cost big player my regaining some quality life . neilmed sailine packets convenient work well unit , i use third packet each mabis session . i no interest whatsoever neilmed . it just convenient sailine product i found drugstore it helped , so you should know it . mabis best steamer you ever use , don't waste your $$$ other feeble steamers like i .	1
i steam inhaler some years ago , kaz therasteam . i problems my sinuses , it didn't help much . i spent years , some money , attempting solutions my sinus problem , insufficient success . it getting better over years , but every now then i still wake up after 5 or 6 hours sleep can't fall back asleep unless i inhale steam -- hot shower sometimes works , but it basically means getting up up while , which no help if it less than two hours before time i'm supposed get up anyway . i shopping new humidifier , not finding much , when it occurred me there might better steam inhaler than one i used . i came amazon looked around , decided mabis . i am glad i ! this item definitely job , giving off copious amounts hot wet steam , which perfect remedy my dry burnt-feeling sinuses . you even adjust it kind steam you want ! my only quibble it says instructions operating time 6-9 minutes ; it seems closer around 15 , which ok me . main thing , because this device , i've gotten some sleep i otherwise would missed .	1

i picked this sonic toothbrush local brooks . just curiosity . it very cheap compare other sonic toothbrush.it felt strange first . since i own other oral-b oscillating toothbrushes there pretty good scrubbing teeth . sonic toothbrush not seem move much , i think , how could it clean my teeth . after couple days , it start think it manual toothbrush , i used it scrubbing back forth my teeth ... it felt very afterward . trick think it regular toothbrush . move it back forth , gently lightly . i use this conjunction waterpik my teeth felt like i just saw dental hygienist getting my teeth cleaned . it far superior than oscillating type , even expensive ones . battery not last very long . so you travel charger . but you can't beat price this quality . - 5 stars	1

i disappointed scale . it needs stored flat , so i can't store it sideways cabinet i intended . lcd screen blocked bowl , angle makes it difficult read . it weigh oz , but not lb oz . therefore , any item weighing more than 1 lb requires you math . order return item i would not reimbursed orgininal shipping i would pay it shipped them . other words costing nearly cost scale itself .	-1
this my first epilator . i love this product . many years i shaving my legs get rid hairs . first it ok but eventually i started getting razor burns i lost smoothness my legs . i totally upset . i trying something different finally i found out good product which completely worth amount i spent . it not so costly . it simply awesome . i love i t.t here no much pain . pain during epilating really very less . anybody bear it . i highly recommend this product	1
epilator what i bought it . it removed hair , painless ( i am long time epilator user , though ) . it so painless , i used only below knees but ventured thighs arms , it worked fine . even tough ones came off after few passes . my first epilator epilady , which fine . it died after 3-4 years , i bought emjoi foreverfree spending over $100 , but it didn't work all . i so discouraged didn't want waste any more money , so fixed my old epilady myself used it 10 years or so . it finally got point it not effective removing hair , so i bought this one . this worth money spent . only thing , which very minor , motor seems bit too loud , head comes off too easily . i can't remember what i make head come off when i didn't mean it , but it didn't come off while removing hair , so i think it ok	1
my wife liked this hair straightener . she tried some her friends expensive once she says she really liked it	1

i actually bought this my dentist lot cheaper . but i found this toothbrush better than my previous one ( sonicare 4800 pro ) . if it wasn't battery dieing , i would still using it . lasted me good 3-4yrs . so i needed new one . wasn't keen new design narrow brush head all since coming larger one older model . after months deliberation , decided go 9800 model . it 2 weeks now since i it . i love bristles this model , their not flat , which really helps getting food out my teeth . which also nice neck thin angled , which i'm able ( finally ) reach back my teeth all around . battery lasts like sonicare says , approx 2 weeks . i'm sure they could used better longer lasting battery . oh well ... i'm happy ! update 1 : i actually got up 3 weeks single charge . that even brushing 2x day full 2 minutes . previous i assumed when i saw yellow light , would only got 1 or 2 brushing out it , but it kept going extra week	1
very unusual fragrance grows you . because it not typical mellow floral or sexy musk fragrances , one hard time identifying it or figuring out what think it . thing not try pigeon-hole fragrance . just enjoy it ! it starts off this very different exotic lush fragrance but then after time mellows out very sexy floral-y smell . ( me anyway ) but it lasts hours . so use sparingly . other reviewer stated , you wear it know . not my favorite fragrance ( hence 4 stars ) but definitely one smells good sets me apart !	1
i bought this my husband just under year ago ( might i add it $35 less back then too , how dare they increase price same older product ? ) he loved it . he used it shave his beard everyday close enough shave make both myself his air force career happy . only problem battery charger not charge battery any longer , obviously he can't use it without battery . charger not even register shaver there anymore it well cared . such shame . i can't find replacement charger , so it looks like it back old three blade disposable razor cream us . i can't afford spend $100 something won't last even year when $4 pack disposables lasts him two months . very dissapointed quality this product . other than , it great razor smooth , clean results almost close regular razor , but there slight difference someone who fast growth and/or coarse beard may shave more often . main advantage it lot quicker used or out shower . but if you want something last longer than 10 months , wary this product .	-1
i bought this shaver march 2006 , = = = $69.00 = = = amazon . i read some reviews decided buy extra packets shaving lotion vs . gel . i agree everyone who stated preference . this my first experience any kind electric shaver , so you may wish take my review small grain sal t.t he shaver itself decent . i find my closest shave still blade razor , but curly hair leading razor burn ingrown hairs . i get reasonably close shave without burn . it miss hairs sometimes but if you go back forth enough you eventually catch it all . note : if you're like me only shave every couple days don't let your hair get too long or shaver won't able pick it up . it best shaving stubble . my one real complaint sturdiness . i've removed one star off rating this . i've dropped it couple times shower , ( after all it wet slippery ) few pieces popped off . everything snapped back together all right , but it feel kind cheaply made	1
pros : effective cleans off easily . cons : may leave dry skin . just use face lotion afterward	1

i'm sure my experience not norm , but its probably not uncommon either . i absolutely hate this stuff . just every eye doctor gives it away , probably because alcon gives it them free . you get what you pay . apparently , quite few people allergic this stuff get stinging or dry eye . i'm definitely one them . if you can't wear contacts long you want , definitely try something different	-1

when i got this razor last christmas , it my first electric razor ( i previously using mach 3 ) . i annoyed my old razor because i devote time getting my face ready before , take time clean my face afterwards , i looking forward razor i could just use . when i started using this razor , i noticed i either didn't get very close shave or i pushed too hard irritated face , even after using large quanity lotion several weeks usage . i discovered , however , using shower changed everything . using no lotion , i able obtain closer shave than my mach 3 no irritation . battery life , i typically get 3 ~ 4 good shaves out it before i recharge it which more than enough me . i yet use gel , but so i can't really vouch it , but my experience , if you use this shower you probably won't need it anyways . overall i would probably give it 4.5 because i don't like using it out shower much , but shave i get shower makes me round up 5 .	1
i'm not using gel - it expensive doesn't worth it . instead i'm using regular shaving gel shaving very good me . i'm usually using it shower	1

i've this razor few months , it gives great , close shave . my only issue product battery life fails live up its promises . it claims 25 minutes cordless shaving , but my personal experience closer half . i don't travel much , so razor usually just stays plugged bathroom , but i am still disappointed philips norelco makes such exaggerated claim its product . despite this , i am quite pleased product whole	1
i've used norelco shavers years i like them . after 4 years my most recent norelco stopped holding charge , so i picked up this one . pros : * it gives great shave ! they've changed heads bit added some holes . whatever it , my shave 30% smoother better than my older norelco less time . * it quiet . i actually conversation my wife while shaving . this wasn't possible my older shaver . * it significanly lighter than my older model . * cleanup really easy . you just flush head hot water once week . once month or so you're supposed take out shaving disks head brush them clean but my guess once quarter would plenty . since cleanup major hassle , this terrific feature . cons : * it takes 8 hours charge . yikes ! eight hours . my old shaver never took over hour . * it hard tell how much charge you left . my older model gas gauge type indicator right front . this one just green light goes when you turn razor . when it runs low juice you'll get flashing red light when you finish shaving . this isn't nearly handy . * shape isn't ergonomic other model probably because water rinsing feature . there little plastic fins stick out handle presumably help you hold when it wet . it doesn't feel very good your hand . * there no case store it . this drawback if you use it travel . * head supposed replaced once year . huh ??? this apparently case all new norelco shavers . these heads aren't cheap , folks . i certainly wouldn't replace one unless i problems shaver -- then i'd probably buy new one . bottom line i'm very pleased this shaver . it job very well it quite inexpensive . i would certainly recommend this model over higher end models if price consideration	1
this best dispenser we used . it attches wall easily , eay fill constructed such way it multiple uses . we purchased smaller ones give gifts-knowing others would like it also .	1
although this marketed dog towel , it appears exactly same size quality their bath towels , just different colour . their regular bath towels come very boring colours , this nice deep red . towel itself , i love them . they absorbent they say , they lightweight ( great traveling ) easy wash , either hand they dry quickly , or washer , where they leave no lint dryer like ordinary towels . i highly recommend them	1
i received this product christmas gift 2006 unfortunately it broke march 2007 . i like it its small size , folding capability , retractable cord , but i really only able use it three months before it just wouldn't turn any more . also , it only comes one attachment straight hair but not curly hair . i like it ok time i it , but since it stopped working completely , i can't give it great review .	-1
this very good hair dryer although bit heavy . retractable cord folding handle real plusses . i take it gym several days week , i no trouble fitting it into my bag . it also seems not dry out my hair but leave it fuller	1
this wondereful product . i hesitant order because price so great but read other reviews decided go it . it worked wonders myself my husband . my husband 215 pounds muscle it really helped him well	1
i so suprised see price amazon offered this . i shopped around lot find this exact massager my dad because it same kind his chiropractor using , amazon price far less than anywhere else . we very pleased this . like some others said heat not great , but amazon special price it cost no more than one without heat , so no harm trying it . definately no other complaints item .	1
when i first started working out i just bought regular gnc brand protein it ok but i really didn't want drink it so i gradually left weightlifting scene behind . now i'm back it i read some reviews decided buy this brand but unfortunately gnc only double chocolate ( not choc fan ) but i bought it anyways . i just use water since i can't tolerate milk well it still taste amazing i don't even like chocolate all much . i shake mine never problem clumping or anything . there other products lot more protein per serving but why down shake taste like [ ... ] once day when you drink this every meal more . order vanilla next since flavor my favorite so hopefully it taste just good . buy amazon , gnc too expensive .	1
i started buying protein shakes back high school one after they tasted disgusting !! you couldn't wait get it down pain actually any stuff hit your tastebuds ... uggh ! so i looked online found out optimum nutrition supposedly makes good tasting whey protein powders . well they aren't just good , they're actually grrreeaat ! this only type protein i've bought since then . chocolate best flavor they expanded it mint chocolate , double rich chocolate , chocolate shake , creamy chocolate , now " extreme " chocolate . basically , if you buy chocolate flavored optimum nutrition shake , you're getting best tasting protein out there price , hands down .	1
24g protein per scoop thats not counting milk . i it over 2 months i haven't gotten tired taste ; fact , its pretty damn good . there no need add anything it make it taste tolerable , it really taste great . i use vanilla soy milk couple ice cubes mix it blender . perfect every time	1

this perfect scale weighing pinewood derby cars .	1
norelco 7745x works advertised ... i've only it few weeks though . cleaning easy it shaves close . colors little bit loud .	1
i bought this shaver my boyfriend christmas this year , i really nervous because he never used electric shaver i really wanted him like it , even though i bought one mid-price range . i thought this would perfect because he shaves shower , i didn't realize most shavers aren't use out shower . he used it four times , even though manual says it takes around 3 weeks your face adjust , so far it wonderful . he fairly corse , stubbly black hair needs shaved often , but this razor , his face feels just smooth i'm used . he says it doesn't get quite close if he shave up down razor , but it not huge difference , we won't returning it . i think it definitely worth price i paid amazon , i hope it becomes available again so other people opportunity try it .	1
wow ! thats all i say . former braun 360 user , i assure you this razor works better than braun foil shaver . very impressive results . it close mach 3 if you only shave grain when you us mach . if you save against grain , this might not good enough you	1
excellent quality product very durable . only reason why i gave it 4 stars instead 5 .. what up case they give you tweezers ? way too small tweezers barely fit there	1
wahl medalist fantastic clippers black men , bald men bald black men or almost bald men who want stay clean . used everyday close clean shave . i get no or very few ingrown hairs . great price usually $10 $16 . but clippers hard find . same place sold me my first pair hasn't sold clippers since	1
i've purchased other products interactive health , including ijoy ( which amazing compared other massage chairs i've tried ) , their ottoman 2.0 ( which hits spot calves wonderfully ) . i bought this hopes get same quality effect i their other products , but disappointed . two massaging handles either side pillow massage sides my neck well , but doesn't hit back my neck all -- that where my sore spot always tends ! " pillow " itself hard uncomfortable , so you position your head carefully order really relax . i wouldn't recommend purchasing this massager its expensive price . however , should you find this massager sale , it decent product . i'm still pursuit more effective neck massager , though ..	-1

my other ( brand ) hot hair brush ' comb style ' type ; this my first ' brush style ' . my preference harder comb style over brush style . it seems hair type , thickness , etc . would certainly play big factor - my hair thick course . this brush style works ... it smooths hair , adds volume , curl ; it just takes bit more effort ' hold hair ' or get ' through hair ' because brush bristles not strong enough go through thick hair . this very good choice , i am not disappointed this product . if you thick or course hair , understand you should use smaller sections styling ; ' lift ' - just holding curling brush under hair close scalp works pretty good ... bad side ... if you don't pay attention , your hair get caught removeable brush handle	1

my wife i bought this chopper love it ! we frustrated electric choppers because they tended turn everything into mush . this chopper creates perfectly sized cuts ( especially our favorite - quesadillas ! ) handle large size pieces . example , i use this onions , but also bell peppers . you approx . quarter chop bell pepper place it ( unseeded ) press - then give it definitive push walah ! i not suggest putting half-onion ( shown picture ) , cutting food surface fairly flat makes big difference . i recommend using it flat surface , it require little extra push ( hence " bubble " top " press here " type button ) . we not experienced any trouble it breaking or too difficult ( we've it 1 year ) - although we lose cleaning piece , so it takes little more effort clean now . ( hope this helps ! ) my husband says , " it what its suppose ... saves time ... it works . " you push end chopper not middle	1

i bought few boxes these odwalla bars january 2007 approximately = = = $22.00 /box = = = during amazon special $10 off promotion . price two boxes these bars came out $35.00 after discount . price one these bars retail stores almost -never- dips below $1.50 bar . so 48 bars , you'd paying $72.00 plus tax . you see , if you know you like these bars plan eat lot them , now time stock up . especially free shipping . product , bars themselves excellent . i eat these daily work where i'm too busy make myself breakfast , i find it takes edge off perfectly until i'm ready lunch . i'm especially fan berriesgomega choc . chip peanut flavors . they both delicious flavor , good texture , much healthier ( not mention mostly organic ) than many other so called " health " bars out there ( hooah ! etc ) , taste far better than anything else i've tried . bonus , these bars shipped out quickly ; i received them within 5 business days my order . 5 stars	1
sleeping memory foam like no other experience . it soft but not like cotton padding . it really conform your body limbs . i notice chemical smell which went away first day . no biggy . it slip off my mattress easily . if i fix it , it slips again same night ( not completely , just 6 " ) . i didn't get quilted cover which may prevent happening . animal hair sticks memory foam like glue so keep it covered . free pillow very small not useful sleeping . kids could use it but i use it while watching tv - very comfy . i bought memory foam topper because i condition called costocondritis ( inflamation muscles ribs ) . my ribcage terrible pain night when i'm trying sleep . i found i fine when i sleep something soft so i thought memory foam would help . it really hasn't i think it because when i'm laying it my weight flattens it my surface area becomes hard my mattress . i am 100lbs overweight so i think that why . i think i just buy softer mattress use this one my hide-a-bed my guests ( oh , lose weight ! ) . still , i don't regret buying it . bottom line , if you heavy like me , topper flatten you won't experience memory foam softness except your limbs . maybe thicker one would work better . buy cover because it " scoot " off your mattress cover protect it animal hair . my children think it feels like cloud lay i recommend it average weight person	1
think carefully before purchasing this item . it so very soft , but chiropractors tell you softness not what needed people who suffer lower back problems . you sink so deeply into this thing , it like sleeping candy floss . after i started using it , every day i would wake up sore lower back , which i thought must related something else . finally , expaseration i removed mattress topper reverted my old , firm ikea mattress . back pain gone immediately . this foam topper really doesn't provide enough support - it ' cradles ' you , indeed , but it healthier your spine sleep firmest surface you find comfortable . there no point sending it back refund - time they deduct ( exorbitant ) shipping fees , 20% ' service fee ' , shipping you pay return , you'll nothing left .	-1

if you extreme pain your neck , shoulders , upper back , this excellent product . i degenerative cervical disc disease ms so this product helps ease pain throughout day but expecially morning . forget rectangular pads $20 , this worth every penny . my generates more heat typical low , med , high selections most heating pads . moist heat ability go up 166 degrees . though it dry heat option i can't imagine ever using it because moist heat really penetrates below surface bring you relief . my only complaint cord should extend front flaps not back one . it little annoying but overall worth small inconvenience every penny i paid it	1

reviewer wachsmuth krogmann thomas tank engine , clear little plastic piece designed light up tank fell into tank after third time we filled it . then water leaked everywhere , including onto electronics . apparently plastic simply glued into tank even slightest touch it falls back inside . when you place tank back onto thomas this piece fits over other clear plastic piece houses actual bulb light . this apparently enough cause piece loosen fall into tank . there no way fix this or any warning not touch it . course normal filling its almost guaranteed you touch this some time . i dont know you , but mixing toddlers , water electricity recipe disaster !! children should never allowed anywhere near this product !! this major defect safety hazard !!!! product should recalled !!!	-1
this " cane " great . if you want relieve pressure your back ( or anywhere , really ) this it ! i love it take it me everywhere i go . i highly recommend this	1
i love thera cane ! i've muscle-related back problems over 10 yrs . however , last 2 yrs really bad . i've chiropractor , massage , acupuncture nothing stuck - plus i got tired spending all money them . first time i used thera cane i almost cried !! within 20 minutes i completely pain free . it such long time since i could move around w/o pain . although pain came back , each session it gets less pain-free time gets longer . i believe i've broken cycle . i just used it morning before work , then after work then before bed . if your pain muscle-related , thera cane well worth it !	1
i looking dryer use after swimming came across this one . i already own panasonic ionic dryer so i looking something preferrably smaller carry locker room use after swimming . size this dryer just right my bag . arm bendable so not take up more space lengthwise . i like this dryer because it ionic it dries my hair up really fast after washing my hair . my hair pretty silky afterward too . this overall good travel size dryer . only complaint i switch .. sometimes it rather difficult switch it off after drying my hair . dryer seasaw-like switch off middle , low setting above high setting below . therefore , too much pressure put switch push switch either above or below not middle which switch it off . otherwise , good buy	1
great second one so good i bought spare case this model taken out production	1
we've using these garbage bags year now they mostly live up claim their strength . we went using cheapest kitchen size garbage bags these after getting deal them local grocery store . cheap bags , i would frequently problems bag ripping when removing trash or fear bottom would fall out bag when filled lots heavy items . i not any these problems these bags . i packed these bags maxiumum capacity no problems . my one complaint area around very top bag susceptible damage , particularly tie top . when i am tying up full bag , oftetimes orange tie built into bag begin rip through bag . this not caused any major issues so far so i don't think it big deal . also , area around top bag weaker plastic lacks flexibility rest bag , so if you removing overfilled bag trashcan , you must use some care . overall these great garbage bags i highly recommend them .	1
positive side , i liked design this groomer well nice storage box . i not experience any problem attaching/removing attachments , like other reviewers . terms actually using this groomer trimming , i'm quite disappointed . i bought this trimmer hoping trim my beard very short . it seems spacers not meant used short beard , since they not trim it . other hand , using trimmer without any spacer , almost shaves my beard completely not what i want . major drawback this groomer battery drains too quickly . more importantly , when battery empty , even if groomer attached wall socket it not bypass battery but rather tries recharge it again which course hopeless when using trimmer	-1
i bought this my husband because he likes keep his facial hair trimmed i found this product . price very reasonable , if you let it charge overnight it keeps it charge long enough perform whatever function you need it . i surprised see other customers who dissatisfied product . my husband loves it i am buying one my grown son his birthday	1

i tried 5-6 hair trimmers , mostly nose hair . they all worthless -- until i found micro trimmer . this little puppy works perfectly . i given up finding good trimmer pulling nose hairs out tweezers . periodically , i would get infection sometimnes lasted over week very painful . i read it also dangerous . micro trimmer takes just few seconds it great job . it ok eyebrows other places , but standard clippers or scissors work better there . only downside it cheaply made . it falls apart it gets stuck . falling apart nuisance . when it gets stuck , i stick razor blade or fingernail teeth move blade slightly . this usually frees it . if not , replace battery . i own 4-5 so i one home , office , car , spares . they cheap they work . i would normally rate something made this poorly 1 or 2 , but sucker works so well i give it 4 .	1
this great conditioner . i super fine hair , after using this , shampoo , i find my hair super soft , shiny not all weighed down . it also great , clean smell , which i love . i would definitely recommend it	1

maybe i high pain tolerance , b/c i didn't find this product painful . it works very well-if hair missed , i just go back over it . much more effective , time saving , less messy than waxing . i've only used it twice but my hair already growing much sparser . i like fact it rechargable , so you more flexibility . i would definitely recommend it , but it seems it really painful some people . however , i think you might get used it over time . i guess if you tolerate waxing , then this might same terms pain factor . maybe pulling your skin very taut might help	1
i ordered source life because i wanted try liquid instead deal so many bottles different vitmains minerals . i dont ' swallow so many pills ... just one cap full liquid ! this simple it tastes great . i don't anything negative say this product except it advertise 32 0z . bottle . my bottle 30 oz . size . but compared other places this best price source life . i tell difference energy level . it good product	1

i use this insurance policy keep my face getting oily , so i can't say exactly how well this works active acne , but chemically this seems equivalent anything else 2% salicylic acid . added twist it contains ' microbeads gently burst contact when massaged into skin ' . what this means it feels like you're rubbing your face soapy grit - which sounds bad , but it good thing . you feel little granules digging into your pores abrading dead skin even when you're just using your hands wash . so i prefer it neutrogena oil free acne wash reason . it also takes just tiny dab palm one hand lather up your face very well , so one tube lasts quite while , bottom dispensing tube very convenient . however , wide flat bottom design means when you no longer squeeze anything out there still quite bit left there . point you need take some scissors just cut top off you'll extra two weeks or so soap !	1

i bought 2 these pillow , one my husband one myself , back college . i would recommend this pillow anyone everyone . its amazing product works just described . we used ours every night over year never dissapointed . there few downsides noted other reviews , but nothing makes it bad product . negatives : core material get bunched up but it easily re-adjusted flattened out . if you vaccume seal it correctly it doesn't get bunched easily . very heavy slides around inside pillow case . requires weekly maintenance keep it good condition . but if you take care your chillow it take care you . positives : after well over year still worked like day we got it . never lost its cool so speak ! chillow my best friend while fighting migraine ! ( which 4 times week)i slept better than i ever my life . note i want point out common mis-conception noted some reviews . chillow get warmer night progresses , however it intentional . our body falls sleep faster cooler temperatures , but middle night when we rem sleep , cold make us restless disturb our sleep . chillow designed become warmer provide more restfull sleep during our critical rem sleep cycles . this very important part what chillow all ! great sleep ! after more than year , i want note both our chillows sprung leaks , thrown out . leaking wasn't enough soak our pillows , but water them so long it slight odor it wasn't pleasant sleep . i am here buying 2 more new chillows , they worth every penny . i am more than happy support soothsoft purchasing replacements great product made my hectic life more bareable !	1

i love these glasses . they always there when i need them ... hanging around my neck ready me put them place . only problem i experienced related application i am using them ... my shop . i got 3.00 so i could good close up look when necessary . however , i've noticed when i'm actively working around project getting myself different positions related object my work , glasses often separate where magnets positioned bridge glasses causing me clear both hands tools or whatever them reconnect lenses . it exasperating , but you've got able see your work . this design flaw product clearly doesn't apply most people situation . some might argue my head just too big ! while i may big ego , my head actually slightly smaller than average . this problem could likely corrected manufacturer extending each temple one inch give glasses more room expand before breaking apart . but important thing you know i'd still buy these glasses all over again . they really terrific	1

if you don't like getting attention , these not you . i'm often surprised people astonished reactions act putting them taking them off ; i'm so accustomed pulling them apart , i forget how unusual viewing public finds it . i wearing clics nearly year . i pretend i don't need glasses , but course i nearly decade . popped standard diopter lenses out , put my bifocal prescription . it worked great , despite warning my optical shop . ( even if they broken experiment , price right : i could try it again . ) previously i wearing glasses chain . besides various difficulties noted reviewer , i also found plastic loops connect chain arms glasses bad habit stretching . then glasses slip off chain inappropriate times frames break . i call color mine " magenta " - which may or may not same online " red " - i bought them shop (** gasp **) . my short hair not problem , but i agree reading bed doesn't work . so i use different pair those occasions	1

( salon waxing / lazor tx/ etc . / too expensive . ) finally : i acheived desired results ; legs silky smooth touch lay eyes , using braun epilator ( plucks hairs out root using 12 rotating " tweezers " ) followed conair hair removal system ( i call it polisher ) . braun epilator removes all hairs long enough tweezed , leaving behind ingrown hairs some micro-hairs , hairs too short tweezed . conair system uncovers all ingrown hairs , removes most hairs uncovered micro hairs . after using braun epilator , conair system , moisturizer , my legs feel silky smooth . smoothness lasts days , not hours . wonderful ! only downside : i use one polishing disk per leg , each time i exfoliate . i wish disks would last longer . bottom line ; my legs appear smoother feel silky longer than they w/ shaving , so overall , i'm delighted	1

just ordered , so i can't comment amazon shipping it , but i used it my miele front loading washer very successfully . one major caveat , though : i use * way * less detergent than scoop suggests - half lowest mark scoop plenty . more than suds remain . perhaps if you pets or kids who play mud lot you need higher amounts , but my " normal " wash sure doesn't warrant it fact seems work better lower amounts .

i admit it , i got this because it cheap ! i thick , wavy hair which needs straightend because i use very very good set ceramic straighteners , hair dryer didn't matter much . however , first time i used it i shocked how straight silky my hair felt ! combined straighteners my hair looks awesome ! i noticed some people commenting dryer cutting out after week or so . this happened me too i too thought it bust . however , i checked plug it one those needs tested before applicance works - you know little red button plug safety ? it not just cut out plug but one needs doing each time it took few minutes figure it out because england ( where i am ) we don't these much . all i now press white button before i plug it it works charm . three heat settings ioniser settings great - it really makes difference when ioniser - not gimick all i suspected ( like i said , i got it because it cheap ! ) . it well worth money great buy ! if you thick hair which hard keep tamed , this really helps before rest regime	1

we used this humidifier our baby room two months now . it great job quietly keep room humid . now because winter not really started east coast here yet . if heater not kick , room would feel cold due humidity . problem this product only knob control output , but seems lacking feedback loop . therefore if it comes thermostat , i would say it perfect . but considering price , i let it go . it pretty easy maintain compared other traditional warm mist ( mineral buildup heating device ) or cool mist ( filter change accompanied loud fan noise ) humidifiers . however , you shouldn't forget occasional cleanings mildew under cap , under tank , base	1

i previously tried waterpik other rain fall like showerhead waterpik cf-201 . it horrible , arm wouldn't hold its place one i recieved this horrible leaking problem probably due its largely plastic construction . low expectations waterpik brand , i stumbled upon this gem . jp-130 looked lot sturdier than their other model . upon recieving it , my initial impressions true , fantastic ! chromed metal gave it distinguishably elegant look no plastic showerhead give . swing arm actually , when adjusted properly actually stays where you want it ! spray pattern very soothing gentle stream . it doesn't pack lot pressurized punch like some other heads . but i wasn't looking . my only gripes if i point out any would need possible longer swing arm . 9 " arm more than suitable most people . but i'm 6'1 " it'd nice little more range . i definitely couldn't imagine deal shorter swing arm . next , it not really problem , but i hope waterpik eventually makes newer model even wider head . 60 nozzles pretty good job covering my entire body if i stand still , but moving around little puts parts my body out stream . extra 1 " or 2 " would nice , extra 3-4 " diameter would superb ! regardless other reviews , i didn't find adjusting knobs hard other reviewers made it out , maybe it just me ? after reading what others said , i expected give each knob my " death grip , " but they didn't need it . overall , you simply can't beat this showerhead money . i'm sure it even better than more expensive showerheads . something people use multiple times day , 7 days week , it money well spent !!	1

i've using sumo tech years , far i'm concerned it best sculpting product out there . great creating shape texture - it light enough my fine , thin , straight hair . it doesn't greasy shine comes most pomades , but you mix little bb brilliantine or styling wax if you want little more gloss . little bit sumo tech goes long way - just put little water your hand if it dries out while styling instead using more . you also touch up your hairstyle during day using damp fingertips	1

i so sick shaving . irritation shaving cream , dry skin , rashes . this product revolution you get close shaving feel without hassles . must buy everyone who shaves	1
i spend alot money getting brazilian waxes . last couple times i must got timing all wrong because within week hair started sprouting up . i can't tell you how annoying , so i decided purchase emjoi epilator . i say this thing fabulous ! since i am used waxing " danger zone " me there no pain . fact it more comfortable than waxed . i also used it my legs , upper lip underarms . it great job everywhere . i highly recommend this product your hair removal needs , it paid itself one use . money i save i buy shoes	1
this second epilator i've owned it doesn't hurt/sting much when it used prior model . i couple places it scraped skin , so you somewhat careful use it properly . all all i'm very happy it	1
it crazy how people come up this stuff . these tooth tunes tooth brushes really facinating actually . song plays your mouth whole 2 minutes so you're brushing your teeth dentist suggested time . parents love it too , if you don't want sit watch your children brush their teeth , but make sure they're brushing them long enough , get them this ! they choose bunch different songs artists . it'll music your ears , teeth !	1
i don't drink often so when i it hard know my limits . this thing really helps . however i found you really wait while after your last drink before it get good reading . once i blew . 04 then 5 minutes later i blew . 09 !! i trust this thing works though . it warn you you should wait 20 minutes after your last drink . i would wait longer though . it worth money me . you should send it calibrated every 6 months though	1
you've probably bought these your local supermarket , so you know what you're getting -an alternative unhealthy snacks . i eat them tasty meal replacement bar , too . cost savings significant buying them through amazon . once we run through box i brought work , i'll buy again .	1
i think this one my favorite razor blades because it gets close enough your skin where it actually shaves . i also think it doesn't cut me often either	1
i can't around any kind perfume , cologne or other smells without breaking out into some sort rash or allergic reaction . if you allergic soaps other chemicals , this product still leave your clothes feeling soft without all strong smells	1
i considering replacing my mattress , but i thought i'd give this product try first . it very simple use i instant results . i've actually overinflated it bit when i sleep my stomach my back nearly flat . no more back problems ! i wake up feeling good change . i'm so happy i bought this , i've recommended it quite few people . give it try before getting new mattress	1
product perfect use daily cleanser or intensive mask . i've used it month my face neat oil free . although , i recommend not exceed 3-4 mins when using mask , since i experienced excessive drying afterwards .	1
i love this shaver -- finally there decent women shaver !. cleaning system works well . only drawback difficulty finding replacement cleaning solution -- i just pay $8 ship stuff ! i think i'll formulating my own next time	1
it apparent upon immediate receipt this pillow not typical king-sized pillow only two inches larger than standard memory foam contour pillow i already own . noted other comment , odor extremely strong . though i not owned this pillow very long , i made numerous attempts " air out " this pillow , odor remains very strong . addition , this firmest memory foam pillow i ever experienced . i'm hoping time it soften , because it certainly not used sleeping its current state .	-1

... until motor went out one i using 2 years . i thought ' ionic ' thing mostly hype , but started using this product couple years ago out curiosity . my entire life , i naturally curly , flyaway hair annoyingly prone frizzing just generally difficult manage . i wasn't sure if it this dryer finally started smoothing out my hair , or if it rather newer conditioners styling cremes i found . when ionic brush dryer i using recently ' died ' , i unable find replacement any local stores . so , instead , i bought one looked exactly same wasn't ionic , thinking it really wouldn't make any difference . boy , i wrong !!! immediately , i again dealing split ends , frizzies , flyaway hair . there something ' ionic ' hairdryers really make difference , i changed nothing else . scientific person i am , i repeated this unplanned ' experiment ' least 3 times . when i use this product , my hair noticeably silkier , shinier , bouncier ... healthy waves hold ( i somewhat thick hair . ) round brush/dryer style also dries my hair much quicker than way i used it years ( round brushes typical pistol-style dryers ) , much less arm-fatigue . heated air dries it ' inside out ' which styles it same time , eliminating my previous need use curling iron or hot rollers create soft waves/curls after drying . i plan keep spare one hand next time one dies me suddenly . ( i feel like 2 years good life , considering use it got . ) i highly recommend this hair dryer if you hair like mine	1

my advice , get this scale . it dead accurate , last you forever . it exact same scale doctors use , very good price . i never buy any electronic scale again	1
this excellent product . packaging very good . it came two pieces . assembly minimum , but slightly cumbersome because weight . scale accurate it looks like it made last . reason i gave it only 4 stars height measurement rod felt toocheap breakable . lastly , it should understood this scale not everybody . it either doctor office or large bath or exercise room . i not able find anything comparable value less price .	1
i looking scale gave consistent weights 25 years . i tried healthometer spring scales numerous digital scales supposed weigh you within . 2 pound . hah . i would step scale 4 or 5 times consecutively get 4 or 5 different weights . now i am confident i am weighed within . 25 pouund every time . assembly snap it looks like scale built well enough pass my grand children . if you looking truly accurate scale built like tank buy 402kl your worries over . unfortunately bowl ben jerry show up immediately morning weigh	1

chocoleans work suppress actual hunger ; however , they nothing " i feel like eating " feeling . i use them suppress hunger , then when i still feel like eating , i know it not real hunger but my usual food fixations . it helps me psychologically anyway , interpret my feeding feelings ! also , they work best if you not eat one hour before after taking . ( drinks don't count , doesn't seem affect anything . ) i love taste , can't tell much difference sugar-free regular ones ... sugar-free only 6 calories less . it very dark chocolate , so if you don't like dark you probably won't care	1

amazon not provide additional responses feedback responses so my only recourse refuting this company false claims through product review . i wrote negative feedback january 25 . i notice this company responds very aggressively all negative feedback . they said my feedback it " blatantly untrue " because i said they not permit returns . here their own published statement amazon site regarding returns certain products : * pillows , orthopedic soft goods , supports , braces other non-returnable health care items . maintain our deeply discounted pricing your safety protection , regional health laws hygienic concerns render us unable accept returns all pillows , orthopedic soft goods , braces , supports , hot/cold therapy items , electrodes or any other item comes contact skin once it evident it opened removed its original packing . we accept returns unopened products . now i ask : how could one ever determine usability product like this without opening it ?!! absurd . this company needs seriously review its tone attitude towards its customers . what i wrote true their own statement proves it . furthermore , i left my feedback january 25 they said i " bought this almost two months ago " when fact i ordered it december 16 received it after . they not truthful public posted opposition factual feedback statement . their rude , dishonest aggressive response says all needs said their customer service ! i not like product all , but i really dislike their customer service .	-1

i extremely thick , coarse , very wavy ( almost curly ) hair -- definitely challenge any flat iron . prior this curling/straightening iron , i owned $150 we t-t o-dry t3 tourmaline flat iron ( see my review ) , $50 jilbere flat iron , run-of-the-mill drugstore curling iron . conair good job straightening smoothing my hair t3 or jilbere . once i flat iron it , it stays so nice smooth next day it doesn't even require minor touch up . i actually like conair better , because no matter how careful i , t3 terrible pulling my hair , jilbere , while better , still caught stray hair now then . i never gotten hair snagged conair . i love one less hair appliance/cord one less cord cluttering my counter . i also really like it auto turn off forgetful people like me . it slightly more wieldy than flat iron or curling iron alone , but that almost always case when you get 2-in-1 anything . i think it mainly due account rounded outer shape when straightening . you hold it little farther away your scalp . i can't think how they could've made it easier , though , while still keeping 2-in-1 design . it easy switch back forth curling iron straightener . power light temp control right front , so i tell glance whether it or not . other flat irons , i look plates see light . one small nitpick i wish i could set temp it would default same temp everytime i turn it . it , i turn it up every time . but conair amazing bargain . less than $30 convenience curling iron / straightener one , i am highly impressed . i would happily buy it again twice cost , would not hesitate recommend it anyone .	1
this hands down best hair straightener i've ever used ... extremely curly frizz-prone hair , i've quite few over years . i've using it every other day past several weeks so far seen no damage all my hair . fact , it feels even healthier silkier than before . it doesn't sear my hair all , which problem previous straighteners used . it heats up quickly incredibly easy use . shipping quick hai stik works great ! definitely worth money	1

i've mine several years now i find it very dependable useful . i initially some startup problems i , too , thought might battery or switch related . however i discovered spritz wd40 into cutter blades made this tool very dependable . all hair-cutting clippers shavers , blade lubrication needed . other thing people should know while blades cut rotary direction , only way hairs get into cutter through slots . so this tool cuts way only , so just putting it area leaving it there ineffective ... you insert reinsert get uncut hairs into slots . knowing these two things should give you good experience this tool . " pulling " " tickling " others report also minimized blades lubricated so they cut cleanly rather than jam	1

you need follow instructions before turning this ... including putting cardboard collar before inserting wax . wax pernicious ... it gets everything ... so warned . i've gotten my eyebrows waxed strip mall salon before few times . last session someone i've never it before - results showed she likely hadn't doing it long . $10 pop plus tip , i finally realized i should doing this myself - no more shelling out money language barrier how i want it , etc . it take while wax sufficiently warm up - 30 minutes . instructions lackluster - so they lose star just . i would say 99% instructions legal jargon keep them sued ... like don't use this your privates , etc . pulllease ! no insider tips - they assume you've graduated beauty school don't bother tell you much all . thanks wikipedia , i learned lot waxing felt better using this gizmo . i successfully waxed my armpits - this took 3 separate sessions . i would never salon . i'm one those unfortunate women bumpy armpit skin ... so hairs go every direction shaving means i get cut every single time i shave . one day , when i afford it , i get laser hair removal , but mean time , it pretty easy waxing home armpits , eyebrows sideburns . i've struggled legs .. so much surface area ... you're only supposed apply wax once skin per session , so i like my skin few days off before attempting again , otherwise skin peels . other kits i looked didn't look easy operate , which why i chose this warmer . while it bit scam all their wax cans fit only this warmer , no other brand seems structured fit . so far , i am pleased results- wax really grabs hair when yanking bunch same time , there hardly any discomfort ... nothing like pain monotony plucking each hair tweezers	1

nice fragrance i suppose , major problem it it seems stick whatever you spray it months ( clothing wise furniture wise ) . extremely pungent but not sharp all , again it seems rather persistent smell , characteristic i'm not too fond . within last couple years ralph lauren changed their marketing strategy it seems though they going younger audiences , laid back type , high school young college students opposed adults ... this fragrance no different , fact given price it seems following line thought " . " i'm actually quite surprised this product hasn't come down price recently construction quality undoubtedly make you think it isn't high end fragrance . there no wearing this formal affairs , instead it made everyday use ... some like it , i one got sick it fast ( probably something " persistent " or " pungent " characteristic , this coupled fact polo sport mellow not sharp ) . comparing them i'd say dunhill desire far superior product : both extremely mellow yet i feel dunhill fruitier more complex price , while polo sport more chemical ( man made)-meets-lavender shocking sort way . i suppose again , price this easily overlooked but me i'm not entirely sure i like it much i my youth . if you enjoy " mellow " everyday wear don't mind rather " persistent " characteristic this fragrance , than all means give it try - it sure popular late , more than few people daily outing know what you're wearing ( adults might think , `something cheap ' while younger individuals might find it appealing ) . all reasons i previously mentioned though , i'm going give this 2	-1

i now own three ( two spares ) , purchased few friends well . this headlamp three light settings : red led ( which i use most : great behavioral observations nocturnal animals , preserving your night vision ) , white led , bright krypton bulb . it runs three aaa batteries ( nimh rechargeables work fine ! ) . i've used my headlamp months field work ( i study scorpions , work all night , so this headlamp gotten lot field testing ) . no problems so far . it comparable headlamps sporting goods stores sell four or five times much . while likely not waterproof , this headlamp definitely water-resistant ( ok use rain ) . i love it , may never need headlamp again . though amazon currently sells them " pack 2 " , they packaged individually , each one comes 3 alkaline batteries	1
i very highly pleased these lights when i received them .. leds great long use things like camping fishing spotlight great when you need real bright light anything . i would highly recommend this light anyone	1
you're probably struggling choose clipper because reviews so mixed . my experience anyway . i bought wahl super taper ii mostly because 5-star review " inquisitivetoo " . i couldn't happier this clipper so far . i've cut my son hair once , my hair twice . this clipper truly cut hair like knife through butter . aside excellent blades , overall design impressive . this clipper hefty , delivering substantial hand-feel . different-colored clip-on combs easily selected color , eliminating need read print each one . only negative taper ii not cordless . attached cord quite long however , allowing good mobility your wall outlet wherever you're cutting . i see this clipper offered through multiple vendors here , wide range price points which confusing . i can't see any difference plastic-sealed versions , bought one priced $55.95 ( this date ) sold through hairproducts-com	1

( that unusual me - i'm normally bored product much sooner than ! ) lotion little thick , but goes smoothly ; nice , light scent ; absorbs quickly so i get my other makeup . if i one " wish " item this product , it would pump wouldn't clog quite so easily daily uses ; but that small concern compared how great my skin looks . i'm really pleased this lotion	1

since i bought shower filter save my hair dried out ( it worked wonders , my hair never shinier)and i very hard water - i began worry bathing unfiltered water faucet . i chose this bath water filter because instead hanging over faucet you simply drop it into tub five minutes before getting . this way , water pressure stays strong enough so my bubble bath really bubbles . this filter not refillable since i just trying them out - i didn't want spend extra money refillable one . but i probably go refillable version now since my skin definitely feels softer .	1
i issue mine , it shorted out or something . just got bad one . i going call it replaced , but new baby , just not time . when i posted my review , they contacted me offered replace it ! talk going above beyond . day such poor customer service , this wonderful ! looking forward my new one , it ingenious product , make " testing " water bit easier , when alone giving baby bath	1
i love this product -- it makes it easy see what temperature takes some stress out bathtime . it also unobtrusive so you still use bathtub shower normally . my husband skeptical it , but then he used it . when i took it off , he said he needed it give our 4 month old bath . i'm looking forward trying out infant tub	1
these glasses always attract attention ( mostly when i'm not wearing them ! ) people always amazed when they see me click my readers into place . lenses hang molded lucite-type back strap ( this part inflexible ) , they pivot so they point downward when not worn . put them , just pivot lenses 90 degree angle , lift them your eyes , voila , strong magnet center joins two lenses nose bridge . side pieces adjust retractable extension encased lucite . i've lost so many pairs readers , but these always right there around your neck , not getting left behind coffeeshop counter ! they not all compact , however , because mentioned before , backstrap molded piece . neck/back strap also makes them little hard wear while reading bed , so i put them after getting settled , seems work just fine . finally , even though they not most fashion-forward version eyewear , their convenience fun clicking them into place makes up their clunky looks .	1

i am 35 year power user electric shavers , many years those remington microscreen shavers . my very first original microscreen excellent shaver , but ni-cad batteries it died not readily replaceable . i several rotary shavers which never really worked well me . so i bought new microscreen which worked well me many years until batteries it also died . this shaver almost good these past shavers , but much less expensive . some disadvantages : screen not replaceable . but most other shavers , replacement screen costs more than this whole shaver . i use same aa rechargeable batteries it i use my digital camera , so batteries never going make whole shaver unuseable . it shave little slower than normal one . but backup shaver , travel , use car , etc , you find it hard beat	1
cuts close smooth . it 5 months now it still works great . would totally recommend it	1
i've never used anything but electric razor , while general i've happy their performance , i less than enamored last few shavers i've owned . my last one , basic braun model , left me oh-so-'80s miami vice look ; one before , norelco , literally fell apart my hands ( rotary heads fell out while i cleaning them , gently , brush provided manufacturer ) . those recent experiences make me doubly ecstatic remington r-960 titanium rotary shaver i got month ago amazon . shave closest i've ever received , shaver itself easy both clean recharge , going more than dozen shaves without needing recharge . ( spirit full disclosure , however , i must admit my beard only moderately heavy . ) some complained trimmer blade too broad , but it suits my sideburns just fine . particularly discount amazon offers , remington r-960 excellent , excellent buy	1

i think half reviews i've read ridiculous . read darn instruction manual . when it your 10% goal weight pops up , use user buttons go up down set it your actual goal weight . don't review item badly when you too stupid read directions correctly !!	1
i recently bought this scale , i think it great investment ! weight it accurate , it allows you both set weight goal , track it you're losing . reviewers who complained you can't set your own weight goal , you . when you set up your user number , it automatically gives you goal weight ( 10%) . per instruction booklet , you then use p1 p2 buttons raise lower number . great feature center balance . if you step scale aren't centered , weight change greatly . this scale , before your weight pops up , there lines going across it . side lines pointing side too much weight it . if you see small dot center , then you're standing it correctly , your weight accurate . course , other than user settings , it still average scale , someone who interested just getting their weight . i definitely think it worth-while .	1
i impressed this scale ! it easy use , easy read ! very happy this purchase .	1
i read this product parenting magazine decided give it try . after first use itself , i saw wonderful results . skin feels so soft supple it seems like those blemishes hidden . i use it every week i recommend it anyone who not time go out those one hour facials every other week but manage spend few minutes shower using this produc t.t he only reason i gave it 4 stars not 5 starts because i observed you very gently rub product into your skin if you not very gentle , you might end up red spots or burnt skin . this happened couple times but now i am very careful very gentle whil rubbing this product into my skin . i still highly recommend it	1

ibuprofen good over counter analgesic ( pain reliever ) works mild moderate pain . ibuprofen generic drug name , active ingredient advil motrin . it comes 200 milligam tablets/capsules . most mild aches , it quite effective . not only ibuprofen relieve pain , but it also real good anti-inflammatory medication ( it lessens swelling ) . thus it also good arthritis pain , any joint or muscle sprains or strains , real good toothache pain too . if two tablets taken , it equivalent previously prescription only product , " motrin " . two tablets , or 400 mg ibuprofen mild moderate pain . three tablets , 600 mg , moderate moderately severe pain . all three doses , 200 , 400 , 600 mg taken every 4 hours needed pain . four tablets highest prescribed dose ( 800 mg ) , should only taken once every 6 hours . reserve four tablet dosaging your really severe pain . 800mg dose equivalent tylenol #3 ( anetaminophen codiene ) , good pain reliever . how you purchase ibuprofen up you , but there some real good generic ibuprofen products less than half cost " name brand " products ( advil , motrin ) . both generic name brand equal terms strength effectiveness . only thing different name brand fancier packaging perhaps easier swallow dose forms . i buy my ibuprofen generic form ; not only i get it cheaper , i get more tablets too . jim " konedog " koenig	1

here what you want good nights sleep ! and/or if you mattress " butt holes " it , you put this topper over it you new mattress ! if needed you get large piece plywood this topper your mattress ! if you like it soft , then this may not you i find it bit firm , not hard , but firm . all homedics memory foam coolcore products , they " odor " ( clean one ) fades time . however one topper last bit longer than pillows unless you pull covers back during daytime keep window open . note it not bad offenside odor , but distinct one . keep mind , it comes big box heavy ( 41 pounds it says ) . so lookout delivery !!! price saves fifty bucks over others ! plus free shipping ! those who famuliar memory foam know how it heats up after you're it while ! but not homedics coolcore keeps it cool ( not cold , but cool ) . add this topper homedics pillow ( see my previous items ) you great nights sleep ! only negative it comes all rolled up , you lay it get " bumps " out after you unroll it it takes few hours ( don't expect lay it right away all smooth ) . they great job packaging it shrink plastic so you know it factory fresh , there bunch moisture eater packets inside , then it inside nifty white drawstring bag ( reusable) !! i must admit , price ( go mattress store see price higher end memory foam coolcore ) it really great !	1

this great product - it actually kind fun . i thought getting it because our friend one he passes around parties . it neat people see how high their blood alcohol content , if it what they expect it . my only complaint this product not meant used often . second time we " played " it ( home ) , readings seemed off . i then read product information if you use product frequently , it may need recalibrated every month or so . recalibration involves mailing it off paying $20 . now we know , we'll keep it our pocket use it when we truly concerns - not passing it around everyone use . but i love they sell these public use , it truly important safety tool modern times	1
i'm pretty happy this digital scale . it ready use out box , without any calibration needed . scale comes two small lithium batteries ( same kind used watches ) power scale itself . you pop 9v battery ( not included ) talking part . just step scale your weight appear lcd quickly . lcd easy read when there light . because it not backlit , so you won't able see your weight when lighting inadequate . scale fairly accurate . all digital scales , it never gives you exactly same reading if you step off step again . but variation acceptable . scale long warranty so case you think it not working , just send it warranty repairs . ( but honest , i think it'll cheaper just buy new one than paying postage . ) talking part not very exciting . english voice , faux female , quite annoying . i think it pretty easy understand , but voice too robotic . actually it also sounds like dog barking . short , this cheap digital scale pretty good	1

i am enjoying my new remington hair dryer ! it good choice , i believe . i especially like long power cord . it also very good not get tangled . my only complaint , if you want call it , i expected hair dryer would quieter than it . i checked around before i purchased it , one selling points it supposed operate more quiet than your average hair dryer , but i can't really hear much difference , if any . regardless , i am enjoying it	1
product great . we twins they don't stay still more than 5 seconds , impossible measure their temperature thermometers need more than 1 minute results . we already bought 3 these 1 didn't work very well . 2 them , batteries came very low , necessary change very soon . i recommend this ear thermomether though	1
i thick , wavy hair falls below my shoulders . it layered , shortest layer my chin . i also few fringes fall eye level . this flat iron better than 2 " conair i years finally died . i would agree it seems wider iron would work faster but it really doesn't , nor it work ay better . fact i think this one works better than wider one . it doesn't dry my hair out much ( if you think how much time your hair spends exposed heat each width plate , it makes sense ) i also find it easier make flips 1 " . it gets short pieces just nicely longer pieces . it heats up quickly i just fine 15 . comb attachment waste time my opinion , mostly due its tangling capabilities . i love it lock it it very light ; makes it great traveling . i hope this helps	1
i purchased this gift my niece who expecting . she seemed very pleased it . it part her gift registry said it exactly what she needed . i am happy this purchase	1
i using nature gate organics acne treatment system just under year now absolutely love results . i using kit uses benzoyl peroxide its main acne-fighting ingredient , but it really dried my skin out bleaching action peroxide ruined countless towels t-shirt necklines . so when friend recommended nature gate organics acne kit , i thought i'd give it try . after first kit , i've never even considered using anything else . i find salicylic acid based formula gentler my skin but still very effective clearing up breakouts preventing new ones . i've used salicylic acid products past without greatest results , but however nature gate organics acne product formulated , it works . ( according their packaging , it combination oligopeptide-10 makes salicylic acid more effective . ) it really important stick complete regimen , though . when i first started using kit , i used three products haphazardly , using cleanser one day but not toner lotion , etc . i could tell difference , though , when i followed package directions used all three . cleanser , toner lotion each their function i'm really happy how my skin feels looks when i use whole system . i've gotten lot compliments how good my skin looks , too , since i started using nature gate organics . this also first formula i've found didn't dry out my skin . i think most acne products formulated teens really oily skin . those us past puberty ( i'm 30+) but still dealing adult acne , we need products effective but gentle . fact it contains natural/organic ingredients added bonus . all those botanicals makes it smell great , too ! me , nature gate organics acne treatment perfect . i don't write lot reviews , but i felt compelled when i saw it posted here because i really believe this product . plus , i'm so glad amazon offering it such good price	1
this trimmer very nice job . i've used it wet dry environments without issue . i've even rinsed it under running water while it without any problems . so it fits bill wet/dry . only issue i opinion thing . lowest setting trim guard isn't close enough too close without trim guard . ( not sure proper name so i'm calling removable blade guard , which also acts trim gage , " trim guard " . ) i am very happy ease attachment removal trim guard . also height adjustment trim guard on/off very easy both wet dry environments . ease use wet/dry , i would give this item 5 . but overall close but not quite 5 star because 0 setting ( no trim guard ) close enough cut skin easily . if i wanted trim hair close i would just use razor shave	1
i got one @ walmart $9 . it simple sturdy like jazzfan says , it great reading if your woman sleeping . it also my default flashlight . i dropped it more times than i remember it still works .	1
i love this massager . when beginning use there bit discomfort but normal any deep massage . after first minute massagers adjusts size your leg pressure needs . i think it old saying " it hurts soooo good " . while using i didn't feel relaxation comes traditional massage , but later even next day benifiest clear convincing . i didn't leg cramps or tension while falling asleep i felt more energetic next day . if it less expensive i would give it 5 stars . amazon price excellent but since many could really use this machine limited income it shame price prevent many buying it .	1
this product wonderful . i bought three , one myself others my sisters . it smells delicious leaves my skin feeling clean . i highly recommend it	1
i bought this product my sister . she living small apt abt 400sqf w/4 cats 1 dog . it like zoo ! air not good everyone tell . i end up running noise everytime i stop . she suffers gerd nasal polyp . she seeing otolaryngologist tried chinese medicine acupuncture . nothing really helping . i heard people living animals same symptoms . unfortunately , she would not give up her pets even if she dies some sort fatal illness . so i thought air-purifier would help , least clean air her apt . i shopping around until i found this which best reviews . she using this product month , she coughs lot less than b4 feel air lot fresher . i definately recommend this product someone who pets don't want give them up .	1
i experiencing severe allergy symptoms so i researched air purifiers web while this one seemed best match me . it awesome . low setting , there no detectable sound but you walk up it feel air flowing so you know it working . i mainly use it one room it keeps room comfortable me . it 2 ft tall but not heavy easy move other rooms if needed . i not it long enough clean filters but when i installed filters initially , instructions easy follow installation very easy . i would recommend this product would purchase it again if i needed one	1
i using this cleanser over 15 years it still best , gentle , never harsh , non-drying . i admit this not everybody , i blessed enough genetics(my maternal grandmother ) not acne problems , but people normal oily skin , not get breakouts ; this one best cleansers use	1
if you sensitive skin this great product . i use it twice day , every day . it great morning get nice clean " canvass " upon which apply your makeup . it also nice job removing makeup evening . i love way this product cleans my face without leaving it feeling tight too dry they way some products . i naturally oily skin this product removes surface oil makeup leaves my skin feeling natural yet clean . this product little , no scent . entire cetaphil line this product designed sensitive skin non-comedogenic . i would recommend this product anyone wants clean their skin without removing all protective oils their skin . my dermatologist recommended this years ago , i am still happy consumer product	1
works like charm . so much easier clean than larger ones	1
i purchased several crane humidifiers thrown several them away : crane , two apples . i 2 elephants wouldn't buy any other models . elephants put out maximum amount humidity least amount problems . only problem i they leak under snout small extent . they easy clean we run them 24 hours day when we home . i would recommend them , but realize there some leaking you need put towel front them . i would buy additional elephants if needed .	1
this trimmer doesn't adjustable trim lever like i'm used , but it gets job	1
i bought different brand previously it horrible . it so loud neighor my apartment building actually thought fire alarm going off . convinced me it time try different razor . i got this because price only used it couple times , but i think it works great . based my experience it blows away competition . if you aren't happy it , it only cost one haircut .	1
when i plugged this model , i couldn't believe how quiet it compared previous model we owned . it worked great 2 weeks , then stopped collecting water . we followed all troubleshooting steps manual , but it still would not work . i very disappointed out $26 we spent shipping ..	-1
i like these wipes because they un-scented . also travel pack comes resealable top so you don't need seperate hard-sided container	1
i purchased this remington use travel shaver remington , model r-890 , several years , still use . i am well satisfied new model 845 tho ' i not use it much ; it use same shaving rotors head 890 . only drawback i find it cannot operate directly off power/recharging cord ; it only recharged run only off battery . 890 used either mode . but then , 845 comes more economical price than 890 . overall i find remington good shaver no inclination try or switch any other make	1
i wish i paid more attention details before choosing this shaver . i paid $5 more than non-rechargeable wish i just gotten cheaper one . this particular model only works battery . if battery dies , it not plugged used . you wait it charge . other than , it nice job	1
okay , i bought this item walmart while ago . this product nothing treat/prevent acne further breakout . i know it cheap one , but also it doesn't work all ... i'd say try either proactiv or klear action . if those don't work then you'd seriously see doctor/surgeon laser treatment permanently get rid acne acne scars	-1
i've using eucerin few years am definitely sticking it . it fragrance-free perfect sensitive skin ( acne-prone skin , too ) . feel very lightweight , but coverage excellent . unlike other moisturizers ( like some neutrogena or oil olay ) , i never apply second layer combat dryness . it worth price . i use it under make-up well .	1
this one simpliest , fastest , most compact roller set i've ever used . it limited 5 large 5 medium ionic rollers ; easy set , easy heat , easy remove . results soft , non-frizzy , wavy hair keeps all day . i used almost daily great results . its tiny footprint allows this set go easily travel .	1

i tried many " non-oily " sunscreens use my face , but i am always left heavy feeling my skin sunscreen smell . i recently bought this one my grocery store use vacation arizona california . i pleasantly surprised this product- it doesn't feel oily or heavy when applied once dry feels though i am not wearing sunscreen my face . i spent two weeks out west plenty sun time never burned . i would highly recommend this sunscreen anyone who hates sunscreen feeling their face , but doesn't want premature aging or skin cancer ! excellent product	1
make long story short , i can't even think shaving daily blades because irritation . i also own 5-year-old high-end norelco rotary ( like it quite bit ) , but i only get close shave it while shaving ( wet ) every 3-4 days , i shave it ( dry ) daily only minor irritation , but not close shave ... not close all ! after researching insatiably , i decided try foil electric ( panasonic or braun ) because almost every review i read said it provides less irritation closer shave than rotary , it better shorter hairs , making it ideal daily shaving . my plan buy braun , use it 30 days , return it then give panasonic try next 30 days , then choose one i liked most . let me put it this way , i know it takes skin 2-4 weeks get used new shaving system ; i owned braun total three days ( that right , 3 shaves ) i honestly tell you i not returning it , not even thinking trying out panasonic . this best shave i ever my life , period ! first shave wasn't close i expecting , but after running it through cleaning system , next two shaves spectacular ... close , smooth not one bit irritation ! oh , don't pay attention those who complain cleaning station loud ... i can't even hear damn thing while shower running , it only makes noise 5 minutes , after it all quiet ... plus it this really cool blue light gives my sink counter very high tech look	1
i agree previous review , they very high quality vitamins but very difficult swallow . i grind them coffee bean blender then add them whey protien shake , seems works very well	1
... so all people who follow me around asking , " what wonderful fragrance you ?

obviously strange comparison teases mind further explanation . may i suggest test drive encompass all aspects thorough trial . first , equipment : exceptionally well engineered intended purpose . sleek design beckons , try me , hands-on approach . well placed highly responsive controls cover all requirements . all seasons wet or dry duty kind animal respected heritage . floating heads firm or soft ride really make difference where linear activated blades meet whiskers . course real issue resultant tribute supremely close comfortable shave . my last experience electric shavers ended my lust one during 1950 . baskets used blades mountains lather my constant companions until recently which point i dared explore mans ' progression species . you believe ? technology , innovation , divine inspiration , dare achieve . there hope yet our survival i base my conclusion solely benefits able finally enjoy without hassel or fear " joy shaving " . system works best me soften my whiskers warm water soap , rinse , then apply 50/50 mix shaving gel penetrating lotion . i call this my 98% shave ( compared blade shave ) . without hesitation i say this my favorite , if not best , purchase amazon . perhaps this simple evaluation but none less one passed all tests ease .	1
recommended " so you'd like start wearing cologne " guide amazon ( which i bought reviewed them all ) this cologne almost perfect male fragrance . term comes mind this case " eq " . it just perfect range scents very well balanced bass , mids , high notes . it not too citrusy like many other colognes i happen like , it more serious definitively male . comparatively it more serious version tommy , more sex-scent oriented than hugo , broad spicy mid-range . it doesn't over-amount top notes never make it your skin , this cologne dependable smell like it when you put it hours later .	1

because family history skin cancer ( non-fatal , fortunately ) , i must wear sunblock my face all time , even just walking outside nyc . since i usually apply sunblock just after shaving , choice product very important . my dermatologist suggested i might try this neutrogena sunblock . it very high spf blocks uv rays , seems dry up entirely without any evidence it ever there . apparently they added ultra-fine silica powder which contains greasy look feel . any case , i liked it it seems work very well . unscented , which good me too	1
while most sunscreens these days protect against sunburn , you know very few them actually protect against photodamage ? photodamage damage sun your skin symptoms which brown spots , wrinkles such . only two sunscreen ingredients protect against long uvai rays cause photodamage ; zinc oxide parsol 1789 . zinc oxide protects broader range these rays than parsol 1789 . this sunscreen parsol 1789 ( avobenzone ) . it good , certainly offers more photo damage protection than most , but sunscreen zinc oxide would better still . zinc oxide also less irritating , it even found some baby care products . because parsol 1789 chemical rather than physical sunscreen like zinc oxide , some may experience irritation neutrogena dry touch . this neutrogena goes very smooth dry you can't even tell you wearing suncscreen . this very nice , although it bit scent which i don't like ( i would prefer it non scented , i don't like smelling like soap-neutrogena , you listening ? ) . all all , money this good sunscreen either your face or your body it particularly good oily skin it make your skin seem less oily . but if you willing spend bit more money , check out zinc oxide sunscreen such skinceuticals ultimate 30 which offers bit more protection less irritating ( zinc oxide less irritating parsol 1789 ) . most certainly least get sunscreen parsol 1789 such this one	1
this basic unit lot like one gramma used , but it safe reliable not expensive some i've seen ( offer no more features additional cost ) .	1

my parents bought me electric razor christmas , my first . god-awful razor actually good learning experience , because it taught me few select things : 1 . i hard time keeping daily shaving routine . i'm always liable skip day . 2 . wet/dry shaving electric actually better than using blade . 3 . nicd batteries , their 8-hour recharge time , huge annoyance . schick ( didn't know they made electric razors , you ? ) i couldn't shave my growth if i skipped day , my facial hair doesn't even grow all fast . addition , order properly charge shaver , i supposed completely discharge shaver , then recharge ( presumably avoid memory effect nicd batteries ) . ultimately , this meant one or two shaves out week ended halfway through process . i went back using blades while . but some unknown force compelled me peruse electric shaver section fry one day . after comparing boxes , i settled this one $ ... it honestly more than i wanted spend , but i figured i could return it if it didn't measure up . first shave panasonic proved me whole " 30-day acclimation period " crap . this thing worked immediately , fresh out box , better than my old shaver ever could . dry . wet shaving , while more involved , shaves much closer while not causing much irritation . battery meter nice feature , but kicker fast recharge time . even if shaver dies , 5-10 minutes all i need it running again . i also don't worry " memory effect " ni-mh batteries . integrated trimmer foils actually works , means i actually shave every-other-day it still its job well . cleaning involves running it under faucet bit hand soap . all this said , there some caveats . hairs my neck still somewhat pesky , won't go away without fight . i experiment find best direction come them panasonic . i'm sure more expensive shavers might easier time them . also , this thing really should come some sort stand . it comes cloth bag traveling , but no stand . get rid nose-hair trimmer ( which i no use ) just give me basic stand so i place set shaver dry . while i could spent less shaver similar features , i'd hard pressed find one this price everything well , without any major annoyances . it wet-dry , charges fast shaves well . only thing i'm not looking forward buying replacement blades , but if it continues work like it past 6 months , i can't really complain .	1
bathroom scales what i expected , i no problems them	1

i'm waiting book come out called " 101 ways use magic erasers " because i'll bet there 101 ways least . these sponges pick upi dirt you didn't even know there . let me tell you some ways i put them use : 1 . used it kitchen walls/ceiling remove dirt/grease film - looks like new . ( not recommend using flat finish or cheaper paints though without checking area first ) . 2 . used it quickly remove soap scum shower/tub without use chemicals . 3 . used it remove car wax black plastic portions my car ( don't you hate it when you get wax there you can't get it off ? )4 . used it my kitchen counter remove wine stain . 5 . used it get gumminess off things i purchased those annoying gummy labels them . i am still finding uses these . they recommend not using them wood i agree . i tested it it remove finish . however if you planning refinish your natural wood ( not painted ) kitchen cabinets something like rejuvenate cabinet restorer ( also great product ) then i recommend cleaning them magic eraser first improve adherence ( worked me , but test it first inside cabinet door make sure you see good results too ) . note - this not like your typical sponge not replace typical sponge ... but instead remove dirt where traditional psonge can't . magic erasers disintigrate you use them so they not last long traditional sponge . bj club used sell their own brand magic eraser ( less $) , but i not seen them there awhile .	1
