i saw jonathan qvc really impressed claim moisturizing conditioner great dry/damaged hair . he also said his products don't strip color out hair like some brands market . i color highlight my hair wanted something would protect it . what disapointment . conditioner bottle horrible dispensing even small amount conditioner . i remove lid . then , it like paste ... doesn't seem go through hair .. even after 3 minutes . when i tried comb my hair out , it like birds nest . i put spray leave conditioner , line , my hair just comb through it . i ordered it qvc ... it going back	1
scale 1 5 , packaging gets negative 1 . you can't sqeeze conditioner out bottle , ended up removing top . value product , jonathan gets 1 . quality product 3 . conditioner feels like vegetable shortening or softened butter . need use more than average . conditioner average detangling after using it four times it condition your hair , but no better than other quality brands . i like it seems cut down drying time , but bed head similar product that out while . option i would rather choose bed head quality price	1
unless you new softball glove break , this product not you . way , way too much oil . just nappy . i might well put mayo my hair .	-1
this hairspray too wet too stiff . it ruined my clean , freshly washed hair made my blonde locks stiff darker - yuck !!!! i love voluminizing shampoo conditioner well voluminizing foam - but when i lightly sprayed " finishing " hair spray- it ruined everything . i stick areosol hairspray instread pump . sorry jonathan :	-1
watching show i thought jonathan really cared hair its no doubt he still but his shampoo leaves alot desired . example , even hot , very humid atmosphere houston , tx it left my hair feeling dry unhealthy , even after using his conditioner ( alot it ) . my hair looks awful after using it . bottle claims it doesn't use toxic ingredients like mea but it use three different types peg , petroleum based thicker found most bath products erode wooden tables just minutes . this just harmful mea , especially people sensitive scalps hair . it claims not strip your hair but products supposed cleanse much less apparent product than peg products . since peg thickener , you're also getting diluted , toxic , solution . even though head shoulders uses mea i find even works better than this . my hair doesn't feel like it any more its essential oils i've switched back other hair products iv'e using . it not worth your 20 dollars , its barely worth 5 dollars . my hair stylist also recommended dove products if you need hydration . don't buy it !	-1
i see several previous reviews acknowledge fact this shampoo leaves your hair feeling like " straw " yet say because this shampoo leaves your hair so clean ! you kidding me ? if " clean " hair means my hair feel like straw it literally feel like straw , then i'll happily return " dirty " hair ... seriously , i've smoother , softer hair drugstore shampoos cost . 99 than this 20 dollar shampoo conditioner ! i could not even run comb through my hair while it wet because this product left my hair feeling so rough ! i rather dry hair , i merely tried this product lark , just see if it any good because i am fan jonathan his show , so i return my drugstore shampoo , dove pantene which always worked well my dry hair .	-1
my naturally curly hair thinning i thought this conditioner would helpful . conditioner not handle tangles my hair nor it make it feel conditioned . i thought it too drippy . i nearly used half bottle pouring it into my hand . i would not recommend this conditioner	1
this product works well when i use it curling iron . low rating cost . i just don't think it worth over $20	1
i'm sure this hair dryer exceptional quality - perhaps worth price some . but i'd careful buying something uses fake science babble try convince you its effectiveness . " most ionic infrared " gibberish . tourmaline , gemstone , electrical properties ( when squeezed or heated , it develops charge across crystal ) , but nothing hair drying , or ionizing air , or anything else . i'd recommend buying less expensive but still high-quality hair dryer instead falling pseudoscientific scam	1
bought this help myself achieve some punch my existing waves . all i got crimps wierd places . found instruction booklet completely not useful . i tried tried but could not produce anything remotely close wave , curl etc . save your money	1
okay , i'll admit . i bought into hype . oooo , no " sulfates " ... oooo , " essential water " .... oooo , " all natural " - no animals sacrificed making or testing this - " vegan " shampoo conditioner ... i headed into shower confidence i finally dumped $35 shampoo conditioner set would make difference my fine straight hair . what difference it made ... volume created products all flyaway hair : styled static electricity generated my hair devoided any moisture it once held this lovely " dessicant " shampoo . no amount so-called conditioner helped right wrong ! i tried various amounts conditioner left it longer longer periods time without any change results . after 3 days feeling wicked witch west better hair days than i , i returned produc t.t his product truly deserves 0 stars !!	-1

i would absolutley love this product if it came apllicator brush instead roller ball . roller ball hardly lets any gloss come out , you find yourself rolling it over over again get decent amount gloss . gloss itself pretty(once you get enough your lips . ) it taste smell delicious . but it way too much trouble roller ball . i would suggest they make this applicator brush . it would make great product	1
run fast you ... not try ! okay , so i bought hype " blow out " . once i saw " jonathan " product line shelf , i thought , " hmmm , how yummy ! " boy , i disappointed . moisturizing shampoo anything but ! product felt like mixture tree sap glue . once applied hair , i felt knots forming . upon rinsing , my hair like it stripped ! i used lots companion conditioner hoping balancing act , but left aghast when i rinsed felt " new " texture my hair . i couldn't comb it out wide tooth comb until i applied leave conditioner product line ! once dry , my hair felt gritty , brittle generally nasty . i'm taking this stuff back demanding refund ! i'm going back my frederick fekkai products immediately	-1

i am so disappointed !!!!!!!!!!! i ordered this scent after hearing it friends , reading great reviews . all reviews i read mentioned lack staying power this product , but i never expected product so extraordinarily weak . don't get me wrong , i not want my fragrance enter room before i ( after all , it not 80 anymore lol ) , but i also not want sniff my wrist so hard detect scent i take off skin ! scent beautiful , i would love wear it ! but 20 minutes after i sprayed it , i could barely detect fragrance . sometimes it harder " smell your own perfume " , i asked my hubby friends their opinions . they could barely smell it either . i would happily wear this scent every day if i could enjoy it all . if philosophy create this scent staying power , they customer life . it stands now , i would not recommend anyone buy this product . it very disappointing waste money	-1
this perfume deserves negative stars . i macy when i saw this fragrance dior counter . bottle gorgeous , i really like hypnotic poison miss dior cherie , so i figured i would give this one try . i really should smelled directly bottle before spraying it my skin . it horrible . white floral scents generally not my thing , but i usually tolerate them . this worst perfume i ever smelled . it way too powdery it smells so cheap . i stuck it my wrist all day it kept making me sneeze . disgusting . not worth money all . if you want buy this scent , i would recommend buying dove deodorant spray instead . it much cheaper smells exactly same . i wonder if it really dove deodorant but repackaged ... hmm ..	-1
this item doesn't include everything mention details . i wouldn't even pay dollar it . don't purchase this item !!!!!!!!!!	-1

key my heart lipgloss chain very cute , original idea , but it fails deliver quality worthy hard candy name . reviews here all stated this cute keychain , gloss nice colors pretty . all very true . i got my keychain pixie tones they're girly pretty i feeling pretty cool it . however , me , disenchantment came mechanics it . now , i've always fairly careful person , i'm not klutzy nor i drop or lose things . my keys normal standard set keys , i never dropped them or banged them against stuff any more that normal yet , after less than week keychain hinges broken twice . first time i able make little mess superglue scotch tape managed rescue it put it back into almost normal condition , second time however , i only noticed entire thing fallen completely apart because i saw only half keychain remained my keys all covered pink goo . how it come apart like this ? i honestly no idea my keys only made very normal trajectory ignition my purse . i honestly only chalk it up really , really shoddy craftsmanship which may adequate dresser-top lipgloss but never something could get even remotely more movement than . it good idea but too low-quality fit purpose keychain . this not way go gloss your keys	1
my husband revolted smell this product . i bad sinuses , so it didn't bother me . far effectiveness goes , there no miracle ingredients this concoction . i used it everyday , several times day , noticed no lasting improvement look or feel skin my hands . cost almost $20 8.5 oz ., i got skunked	1
i bought this soap just see what all philosophy hype all . i not impressed . it smells just like ordinary soap-so what ? only reason i gave it 2 stars because it lather well . you get soap smells better wal-mart !	1
i read label , it not rare , tropical oil all , but plain old american palm oil ! false advertising really bothers me . it condition my hair well , but i agree fragrances ( which added it , way ) make odor very strong unpleasant . price also very high . i not order this again	1
this hit or miss product . i ordered 5 oz jar while smell nauseating ( burnt coffee/caramel/cigarettes ) , product work while . my extremely dry , curly hair soft shiny but then product became too heavy my hair stopped working . i would save my money experiment other oils such coconut , jojoba , almond , avocado before shampooing or after . i adjusted my hair routine using natural shampoo conditioner adding jojoba oil my curl cream it never happier . if you want try product , ask company send you samples or find store sells them .	1
disappointed customer . i very thick , coarse , wavy hair trying manage it nightmare ! before using fekkai luscious curls lotion , i using aveda curly lotion matrix curl . life contouring creme . both latter products work very well my hair . i don't like blow dry my hair ( too time-consuming ) , so i just air dry it . without blow drying , whether i'm using aveda or matrix , results great ! my hair smooth , shiny , less frizzy . i never used fekkai products before , but decided give this one try . everything luscious curl enhancing lotion claimed , didn't my hair . fact , it actually made my hair worst ! it became stiffer , drier looking , frizzier . addition , my wavy hair , ( usually bouncy alive ) , became flat dull . also , i didn't like scent this particular curling lotion . it very strong smelling made me nauseous . because my very poor experience fekkai luscious curls lotion , i wouldn't recommend it anyone . i think i'll stick aveda matrix curling lotions , since they much more compatible my hair .	-1
i've using this product almost 2 months i seen no difference whatsoever appearance my dark circles . yes , it burn ! only thing i'm glad i bought it ebay cheaper than it normally sells elsewhere . i've dark under-eye circles all my life . i suppose i should just learn live them save my money . i not wasting my money this product again	-1

one , i don't think this better than botox . botox works instantly more dramatically , but it more expensive . however , when you think how much you're spending this strivectin , applying it every day rest your life , you could get botox ( yes , you need get more botox every several months , but costs same ) . not only , but botox simply works better . however , if you just can't afford botox , then i would buy rulinea fx which exact same ingredients strivectin , but half price , it available hsn.co	1
never i so unhappy my makeup i when i using clinique . i used stay beige ( which i lightly patted my face top clinique superfit liquid makeup - i oily skin told this would help reduce shine ) end result it just made me look ghostly . i also hated how clinique liquid foundation powder didn't matching shades , so i settle honey liquid beige powder . much i went back macy try convince them these weren't my shades , they just wouldn't listen . either they didn't time or patience help me pick new shade , or they convinced i making big deal out nothing . instead sitting there arguing them ( which i shouldn't first place ) i just switched different makeup line : laura mercier , which i am very happy . i've many other friends who unhappy clinique switched over different makeup brand , well . i'm not trying knock product . i'm just saying it wasn't me or many other people i know . i would definitely not recommend clinique anyone . i'd rather pay little more get better results rather than settle $20 product just because it affordable .	-1
i honest . i bought all hype mineral make-ups . my sister uses bare essentials her skin looked flawless she uneven tones like i . i didn't want pay price or join club so i tried pur minerals . i still use " cover-up " under my eyes blemishes put pur minerals rather heavy get " flawless " look . but then it looked too powdery . i started using my regular cover-girl foundation powder again i felt it covered better less heavy . just note , my sister said she still uses " cover up stick " when using bare essentials too , but she looked beautiful it	1

overpriced mediocre soap terrible perfume	1
this product might better oily skin no make-up . point it lost me . it may create barrier treatment products/moisturizer make-up but it nothing perfect my skin . fact when i touched my face i could feel make-up pilling rolling off . it dry , heavy feeling it . don't use too much careful dry patches . i thought it would make better canvas my skin . i now use laura mercier primer which goes light smooth gives healthy glow . i didn't like formulation philosophy product all	1
i normally like warm , sensual-type perfumes , but i wanted try something different change . i liked fact this advertised subtle not perfumey . well ... i disagree . i think it very perfumey not subtle all . me it very sharp , high-toned scent which almost acrid . i thought first maybe i sprayed too much , so i tried just little spritz . still very strong sharp . i agree comparison dead flowers dryer sheets . i definitely not ordering this again .	-1
one my " boys " bought this item me , well its ok price ... its kinda sticky skin unless you rub it really well ... scent extremly light which i dont like , now if they make it stronger ... this would 5 star product	1
i am dissatisfied lush claims many its products , like this one , natural . i encourage buyers who looking products made natural ingredients carefully read ingredients lush products . i yet see lush product not contain chemicals questionable safety . there numerous other brands truly all-natural soaps shampoos work excellently	-1
i've this dryer almost year now , like styists who also own it , i find it temperamental . it great job while it working , but thermostat gets progressively buggier after three months . if you turn dryer off , you'll wait it cool completely before it turn back . now , it turns off while i'm middle doing my hair . stylists three or four these so they alternate working one while other(s ) cool off - i said , when they work , they're terrific . i'm going replace mine brand	1
this fragrance ok teen princesses . this scent doesn't linger too subtle . not nice vera wang vanity or sheer veil . i don't recommend this unless you 16 under . i gave it my 11 year old she loves it	1
i'm everyone else when they say they diappointed this product . i opened this bottle , expecting totally yummy scent but what i got nothing like what i expected ! when i read it smelled nesquick , i thought i'd like it anyway , because i love strawberry nesquick . but this stuff smells like ... well , i can't describe it . all i know i wish i hadn't paid $16 it . live learn , i guessperhaps strawberry ice cream 3-in-1 gel smells better . off topic , why they strawberry milk shake 3-in-1 gel strawberry ice cream 3-in-1 gel ? wouldn't they smell just same	1
i knew i taking chance buying cheap eye cream sure enough i right . it nothing ! well yo get what you pay ! i going try ocuderm or ddf products i guess i now . costs more but results i hear great . i should known better ...	-1

i received this free sephora birthday present because i signed up beauty insider . i gave it my neice her 7th birthday she likes it , but there no reason this product should cost $16 . i'm betting ingredients , packaging shipping costs don't total more than $3 . i wouldn't buy it .	1
i read many good reviews this product this site elsewhere so i eagerly bought it . it came quaint little tin but i thought it smelled kind awful . skin softner , it worked well but i threw it out after using it only few times because way it smelled	1
i bought ultra hydrating shampoo , conditioner , treatment , oh also hairspray . these products dried my hair out horribly weighed it down . i gave it 2 weeks because it so expensive after two weeks my hair never looked any worse ! i naturally wavy , thick coarse hair this made my hair unmanageable - like helmet head . my hair no movement , no shine -- just made it very heavy weighed down . last night i used hair purifier shampoo gets gunk , minerals , etc out your hair after i deep conditioned it kerestase masintense - wow , what difference !! afer blowdrying my hair it soft , shiny so much bounce ! i woke up this morning my hair still awesome . so glad my old hair back - i beginning think i hormone problem or water problem but it this ojon product - horrible if you type hair i . good luck	-1

i bought this item because i heard it waterproof i looking something wear swimming . i'm really not impressed . one thing i say it color blended well my skin . bottle it looked like it would way too dark , so i surprised . it looks like there might little wiggle room far choosing correct shade this one . coverage not very good , though . you put little extra without it looking cakey , but it doesn't cover well say lancome photogenic foundation . i also highly doubt it waterproof . water-resistant , maybe . defintely not waterproof . it rubbed off pretty easily dry kleenex even more came off wet one . when i tried coverblend water resistant makeup i use soap get it off . coverage also much better . unfortunately they don't offer many shades leg body makeup . i also found dew finish not work my skin . i combination skin tend shiny t-zone . this foundation left me shiny nose forehead . it also made rest my face feel slightly oily , which it normally not . overall i would say this foundation very poor value i defintely returning it sephora . least sephora free returns . :	1
i bought this mascara based review i read amazon . maybe it just me , but i still find my lashes " clump " or stick together this product . it might navy color . i don't think its worth extra cost - i just well drugstore mascara	1
smell gorgeous ; it really lives up its name " happy " -- ( just lightly musk-touched citrus overtones - it great scent day or night ) , but -- this big but , like real happiness , it very elusive . scent skin , it completely fades away after 10 minutes ! example , today i sprayed it quite liberally now can't smell it all , even if i put my nose my wrist ; i swear , it completely gone . very disappointed , thus cannot recommend it . 5 stars scent but minus 4 stars staying power = 1 star . even lightest perfumes should staying power , or else what point wearing them ?	-1
i got talked into buying this fresh boutique las vegas . first , it very expensive - $38 , forgivable if it outstanding . it not even good . wand isn't well made , product clump it , then it clumps eyelashes rather than lengthen them . i tried all week make this purchase work out best , but no avail . worst part , end day if i happen rub my eyes , it smears - racoon eyes . i've using physicians formula revlon primer both exponentially better , i could purchased eight them cost supernova . positive side , it washes off easily completely soap water .	-1
i very unhappy this product . first shipping took way too long . second , tube much smaller than sold macy cost more . contents gross , very goopy . not smooth . like it sitting hot warehouse months . i'll fight mall buy this next time	-1
it doesn't work what we intended it : blackhead removal . my teen son really hoping this would help him .... it didn't . not only , but safety cap lance end doesn't stay .	-1
only reason i'm giving this two stars instead one because i love benefit . said , this perfume what we like call sleeper . it so faint you hardly smell it , but when you , it not pleasing all you immediately scramble something smells better . if you looking young , fun perfume , stay away this one . it smells old drab , like your grandmother china cabinet or antique store . but if you like ..	1
i wouldn't call these regrettable purchase ... i guess i just little mislead how these thing worked . it doesn't explain packaging . i couldn't figure out why box so heavy . they just socks , right ? right ?? well , they aren't . insides coated some sort heavy-duty silicone . this makes your feet sweat when you put them . i mean , they really sweat . when you wake up , you're feet sweat so much any outer layer skin cells you sloughed off . hence soft feet . very warm feet . they'll good winter . reason why you're only supposed wear these once week because i bet you'll get really alarming fungus if you it more . i tried them two nights row once day 3 greeted me intense athletes-foot-like itch . not fun . other gripe i they don't come washing instructions . great . these socks one purpose life , make your feet sweat then refuse washed . i found handwashing them sink some handsoap works fine . now , anyway . i don't think they belong washing machine . laundry horror story likely ensue .	1

i love clinique products used them more than 20 years . exfoliating scrub convenient because it comes tube rinses off easily . ( though you only get 3.4 oz ., must use quite bit it see good results ) . however , it not work well original " seven day scrub " . original product while greasy bit pain use , exfoliates almost well professional microdermabrasion not irritate - even daily use . few years ago i spent summer neglecting use my sun block . needless say , my skin became mess ( dull , blotchy , discolorations , rough , flaky , etc . ) . i began my basic clinique regimen ( mild facial soap , clarifying lotion #2 , dramatically different moisturizing lotion , seven day srub ) . less than two weeks i saw huge difference , my skin back normal . i tried exfoliating scrub later , since i hated deal original " seven day " but soon went back it it truly works best . now i always wear spf 45 my face stick my seven day scrub .	1
this item fine when it came pictures ; tattoos not visible film first part our wedding . however i told few guests it looked like i fight before wedding ... make-up should not look like bruises ! make-up also started fade not long after ceremony ended , it short ceremony . end reception ( four hours later ) you could clearly see tattoos . also , i told make-up would not rub off onto clothing if i used special setting powder together cream ... not true . i now make-up stains one my brides maids dresses . i realize now i should just let tattoos show . why tattoo if you're not willing show it off	1
this my first cologne purchase . it really delicious scent -- complex pleasant , not overpowering . give it 15 min dry mix your skin . it truly smell different first spray . i can't stop smelling myself ... i really love smell . my only complaint ( it biggy ) it doesn't last more than few hours . after two or three hours it completely gone except slight trace when i press my nose my skin . i've tried spraying it my body ( neck , wrists ) also my clothing , it just doesn't last . i feel need carry bottle me reapply it every few hours , but that not going realistically happen . it really disappointing , since it so delicious	1
ok , so this 2nd philosophy product i've tried felt need write review . i say , this product far below expectations . i sprayed , only thing you smell alcohol . there seems no other notes it , even after you let it settle , all you pick up alcohol . definitely not recommending this product .	-1
i love , love , love , lipglass normally . but this shade terrible unless you want look like bad go-go dancer .	-1
i bought this stuff because i heard it helped razor burn . my husband likes me shave bit more often than i liked , well , too bad him !! pain putting this stuff way worse than any sort razor burn ! no thanks !	-1
i used use tend skin . it works ok , but there better things out there now . tend skin outdated product ... like sytptic pencil . tend skin stings , smells like pure alcohol there lots wasted product because it easy spill . i recently switched min solution2 like it much better than tend skin . min solution2 roller application ( no waste ) , organic spearmint ( fresh smell ) doesn't burn like tend skin .	1
i love these products however , this particular candle not same , intense scent previous candles i've purchase	1
this perfume smells like you just sprayed lemon pledge all over . it terribly strong just not quite what i wanted . company promptly give me refund though . i suggest you try out " demeter fragrances . " they more natural smelling	-1
like fresh farmacy , i bought this soap based reviews ended up giving it friend work . don't get me wrong , i love most lush products , my husbands chagrin , end up spending lot money their online products but when i got this particular soap i just couldn't get into it . i admit it smelled bit better after showering it first time but still found myself reaching my " sexy peel " over this stuff . i ended up giving it friend i work but only after it passed over my three other girls my office ... i'm just not getting " heavenly scent " this item described previous reviews	1
i bought this my wife holidays , it bit expensive candle but i believed it would last long time burn uniformly . however , our case , after hour candle went out . wick burned too quickly , becoming too small , now candle won't stay lit more than few minutes before it drowns wax . return shipping cost lot , so we just toss it out . waste money , don't buy one	-1
this brush not firm expected . i expected greater quality sephora brand . however , price brush rather cheap comparison " finer " brushes . so actuality you getting whay you pay this item nothing more	1
this shampoo just awful . it greasy it made up 90/10 ratio , 90 oil 10 soap . smells great but leaves your hairl slimy gross	-1
i received two sizeable chunks karma soap couple my orders i thought i'd give it go . eeeep - there whole bunch patchouli there ( which i hate , but still thought i should least try ) . maybe i'm overly sensitive patchouli but it so strong . soap whole smelled like sickening mix syrup-y orange soda mixed dreaded patchouli . fair though , you smell different elements it appreciate it . aside this , this soap melts incredibly fast . even if you keep it draining soap dish , even if you take it completely out shower , away steam , it still melts alarming rate ! i see how people ( who love herbal scents ) would like this . it unique scent depth layers it , but it just not me	-1
like said earlier review , after couple weeks mirror quits working fogs up so bad you can't see thing it shower . i run hot water it it still fogs up after couple minutes , then you can't clear it any method . total waste , not worth dollar .	-1
rosey this oils smells , it just isn't good real thing . fragrance oil , it no medicinal properties . i certainly wouldn't use it my skin , or bath ! thanks , but no thanks . you definitely get what you pay	-1
i opened my falling love compact expecting lovely smell after reading hype . this worst smelling perfume-ever . when i put it it smelled like burnt clothing-like iron just it worst cotton . it so awful i put it straight bin	-1
i received this soap free online purchase . i never purchased soap lush i don't think i after my experience ooh la la . scent pleasant enough , color bar this stunning deep purple ( kind like grape ! ) , but it doesn't feel like soap when i'm using it . it kind smears purplish film me then when i rinse it off , my skin feels very tight dry . i've unable get any lather this bar , although admittedly i very hard water where i live . i read previous reviewers complained how long this soap lasts . like all lush products , it imperative you not leave it shower or tub let it dry completely uses . i've used bar four or five times while it noticeably smaller than when i opened it , i probably 90 percent it left .	1
i truly say this products doesn't work . i silky wavy fine hair i am hair food junkie so i used lot things , but this don't work . usually anything tame my hair but all this conditioner make it hard , matted , tangled . carol daughter products may work some , but it hasn't work anyone my family we all different hair textures	-1
i fell hype now am out quite bit money ....... save your money , trust me ! i used this product 2-3 times day until entire tube gone ( took several months ) saw no change whatsoever ! i serious dark circles , which what it claims help . i am very disappointed this company their product never buy any item their name it again ! what bunch crap ...... btw - look * all * reviews , this product listed several places here !!	-1
click-stick applicator ridiculous . you no control over shadow . when you click it , nothing comes out . you twist ten times , then , suddenly , huge blob , enough eighteen applications , comes busting out . only way i've found apply this use my own shadow brush dipped this huge blob . i purchased three colors same time all three tubes work this same way . far actual shadow , it fine . nothing spectacular . you could get same product wet'n wild buck .	1
i spent $$$ this supposed miracle product month ago .... don't waste your money ... absolutly no results .	-1
i used phytospecific relaxer my virgin hair during summer ( 2006 ) . i first thought it great investment ($60 ) worth cost . after use , i found my hair relaxed but not " bone straight " i've experienced other relaxers which what i desired . my hair very soft fine quite sensitive chemicals so i search product would straighten my hair not leave any damaging affects . after 2nd treatment ( september 2006 ) , i soon found my hair experiencing breakage around temples severe breakage nape my neck . i quit using product . perhaps this product works some but mentioned earlier , my hair quite sensitive chemicals unfortunately , i experienced hair loss ! so , it back drawing ( or growing ) board me	1
instructions say , " use whenever your skin needs boost . " it goes imply you see result every time you use it - it not one these products where you need use it repeatedly see results . i bought it big upscale department store used it night . now winter approaching , my skin gets little wacky times . product comes out gel but becomes creamy you apply it damp skin . instructions leave it until " full froth " forms ( approximately 5 minutes ) , then rinse off . cream began take consistency foam after 2 minutes , end 5 minutes foam beginning dissipate leave big empty patches my skin , so i rinsed it off . my skin didn't look any different when . it didn't feel any different when . $52 i expected least some type visible change - even if it made my skin redder , or plumper , or something . unfortunately box now bottom trash , so i can't return it . we christmas guests coming ; maybe one them enjoy using it	-1
all honesty , i'd rate fragrance itself " 5 stars , " however , scent not last love nor money , which why i give it mere " 1 star . " you'll find you continuously apply it order anyone compliment you it , consequently , before you know it , you've depleted your perfume ! talk anyone who worn or even sells this fragrance , if they're honest , they tell you exactly what i've written here . because i adore scent , i'm going try baby phat goddess body lotion see if lingering effect	-1
this didn't anything me . it supposed very subtle cumulative effect ? i am returning it . i'm really surprised others such great results , because i tried it twice left it double time , still it nothing more than wash my face maybe moisturize cream . it more than baking soda h2o2- also contains catalase , some stearic acid , some vitamin . course , your skin already its own catalase .	-1
ok ive using proactiv 4 year now i say it work me well like 90% one or two breakouts month so i pretty pleased . people often asked me what i cuz my change drastic , so nice . one night i styed up late murad infomercial came it looked pretty convincing since there where no celebritys advertising it they even compared it proactiv , so i tough i would give it try so i ordered it online next day . couple days later i received package i pretty exited so i began use it liked overall feel it . few days pass i wake up one morning all these little white heads my upper chin i immidiately grossed out but since they said it normal due purging i didnt worry much , one week later it got worse even began breaking out places i hadnt before like my forehead . i knew somethign wasnt right so i went online started reading other custumer reviews shocked similaruty thwe problem so i freaked out decided stop using it because it got so bad point where i didnt wanna seen top it became very painful both physically mentally i becamed sorth depressed situation i sorth felt like teen going trough puberty again . i now gone back proactiv seen improvement so hopefully within next couple weeks it clear up again untill then i wanna crawl under rock hahaha . my main advice really ur research before trying something new because u may end up worse than before	-1
like others i disappointed after couple times using this product . like others i started breakout where i not broken out before , my forehead etc . i bought this product because i problem areas . using this product brought out more problem areas dried out my skin . i used product prescribed . commercial said it gentle what made this product different rest it wouldn't cause acne only it " gentle " formula help it immediate results . not true all . this just like any other product market acne . if you weeks pain suffering embarrassing breakouts more than what you before get results , this product you . i , other hand , couldn't deal additional embarrassment my skin getting worse before it got better . when my trouble areas weren't bad first place . not recommended they advertise . they aren't different than others . proactive same thing .	-1
i didn't know you supposed peel waxy rubbery black stuff off soap ... i normally get store-bought olive oil soap but it smelled so good , i try it . i ended up covered black , waxy streaks all over my body when i got out shower ! they didn't rinse off , either . only thing seemed work rub really vigorously towel ... i still black smudges wax residue . once i figured out how take knife coating , i better opinion soap , except it pretty much cut soap half . it smelled really nice , but i don't think i would get this again .	1
i very high hopes this cream , it appears they went extra mile quality . not so . cream when used leaves alot friction razor goes over your face , making some tense moments should not there . i used many creams . so far art shaving best . casswell massey ok aveda . avoid truefitt . update . trufitt hill accepted return we spoke problems . they sent me new updated extra fine version should available public now same quality massey . it good . standard still substandard	-1
i worked two women who worn this perfume , frankly , i can't stand smell it . it doesn't even smell like perfume , it like some bizarre animal musk . there no floral notes , no woodsy notes , either ; nothing clean or fresh or pleasant . i wish this perfume didn't exist --- i hate it .	-1
i thick coarse hair looking something make it softer . i used just little bit it really greasy . i am currently using lanza anti aging plant serum . it works much better	1
i love , love , love , lipglass normally . but this shade terrible unless you want look like bad go-go dancer .	-1
it only takes little bit reading realize abrading skin piece metal not solution ending blackheads/enlarged pores . using this " extractor " equal using one fingers squeeze out imperfections , which may produce very temporary results , but ultimately fruitless . those who feel need purchase this device should invest professional deep-cleaning instead , which rid skin excess oil help pores close without aggravation	-1
my sister-in-law bought this product me after i admired shade ( purr , light baby pink color ) she wearing . i used other mac products before great results , but very dissapointed this product . first all , i gave this product one star because shade look very pretty lips went very well my skin coloring . however , this product sticky . very sticky ! it not matter whether you apply lot or very little , you still wind up this horrible heavy feeling your lips . not only it sticky , but just down right uncomfortable . when i wear lip gloss , i want soft smooth feeling . i want able rub my lips together without them getting stuck together ' dragging ' so speak . also , because this gloss ' consistancy , it tendency clump together your lips form line ' gunk ' both upper lower lip where two meet rest together when you your moth closed . this start happen only 15 minnutes after application . very embarassing when you talking some hot guy then look mirror afterwards discover you gross lines your lips !!!! this product seems popular other viewers , however , i would never reccomend this anyone	-1
if you some respect your nose , please don't buy these wipes !!! i bought these thinking maybe it would nice soft smell , but these thing more than enough perfume stink your whole house !!! i would never put it delicate skin my baby	-1

i bought tendskin help irritation razor bumps i get my neck shaving . product claims , " reduce appearance unsightly razor bumps , ingrown hairs , redness shaving . " but despite it lofty promises high price , it none this . fact my case it made irritation red bumps worse , i sensitive skin main ingredient this product alcohol . directions tell you apply it after shaving , but because alcohol dries out your skin painful apply after shaving , it only made my problem worse . i wish i could rated this product zero stars , because it absolutely worthless	-1
i think i may bad batch because when i read reviews how yummy it smelled , made me curious . so , i tried it i hated it ! smell it turned my stomach . it soften my hair bit , but i don't recommend using it again . sorry lush	-1
i really excited this ! i hoped it would faster , easier way make up what not , but its not . it smears like crazy , end so sharp , it hurts apply . but doesn't matter ! end stops working after use or two . i suppose if you wanted make up similar raccoon blueish eyes ( black more navy then black ) you'll happy . i've always loved mark products , but this disappointment	1
i bought this product mainly because my daughter fair , sensitive skin , which most facial wipes cause her minor irritation . this product worked very well far thoroughly cleaning her face , hands etc . it not irritate her skin all ... problem , one only problem , fragrance , if you call it . it stinks so bad , i not want go near her after i wiped her down ... i give her bath , it so bad	1
i ordered " fedora " . i am so dissapointed , it came off within few hours ! just peeled right off . not order this brand fingernail polish . it worst i ever used	-1

well first off , i'm guy very short hair ... so i don't know whether or not it really works . but i'm bored decided rate it anyway . so here goes : consconditioner really thick difficult get out bottle . best solution this let bottle sit upside down . prossmells damn good . i'm not big fan fruity/coconut aromas , but i like this particular smell so much i might need go rehab sometime future . bottom line : although this conditioner difficult get out bottle , it smells really good . whether or not it work your hair , only way know try it . even if ot doesn't work your hair ... it worth 20 bucks just open it up smell it every now then . =)	1
very picky shampoo this really good dry color treated hair . i tell it made difference	1
i used this product this morning first time . i washed my hair , blew it dry , most way , then rubbed product my hands lightly distributed it throughout my hair . best way me describe it , , it like creamy hairspray . yes , it tacky , like hairspray , but that how it helps you get style you want . what i like how it works my hair , it really tamed frizzes brought down " big " hair look i usually after blowing my thick hair dry . i think it would also work well days i blow my hair out . i would probably blow it out first , then apply some dirt help tame smooth it . i see where it might make thinner , straighter hair bit limp , so careful not use very much . edit : i think it best apply slightly damp hair , might help people trouble applying it completely dry hair	1
i chi turbo ( 1 " ) , but i got worried after reading some reviews it unreliable . so part reason i wanted buy t3 iron it comes 4-year comprehensive warranty . other difference solid-ceramic plates " infused " tourmaline which i found intriguing . 1-3/8 " wide plates perfect width my long-ish hair . ( i've used 2 inch wide iron , which i found harder maneuver . ) it heats up fast , stays hot . it great job gripping hair without snagging . my hair stays silky straight all day , not feel damaged after while , like it cheaper irons i've used past . thing this iron other irons not well - it really curls . it heat vents sides plates lets you curl your hair twisting it near root pulling it through ( different usual method gripping ends strands then winding up ) . it creates springy curl better than any flat iron i've used . ( however , heating vents make exterior iron hotter touch . so there drawback this function . ) overall , i enjoy using this flat iron . very happy this purchase . eta : i've learned hairart not honor warranty unless you buy it authorized distributor ( e.g. , sephora ) . so you might want check before you place your order	1
after reading other reviews i little worried using product i already ordered . after using it few days now my hair never looked better , i truly feel like this shampoo/conditioner meant me . i fine , super straight hair , middle short . it feels clean sleek . conditioner smells like pina coloda , yum ! i would definatly recommend this my hair type . would maybe recommend lather shampoo your hands first then work thoroughly ( it doesn't lather well some shampoos lots glycerine them ) only apply conditioner towards end your hair leave few min . hope helps	1
high beam nice subtle highlighter . however , sure blend it very quickly well or it look unnatural certain lighting ( it'll look like you pink nail polish your face ) . it also tendency emphasize pores . so only use it areas your face where you don't any , like top cheek bone under your eyebrows .	1

this dry iron absolutely amazing , i really can't say enough it . great all types hair ! it heats up just seconds what would take almost 2hrs blow dry my hair now takes less than half time . plus your hair comes out extremely straight . highly recommend anyone who wants their hair look great but doesnt time or energy sit hair salon hours . it investment your hair , one better ones i've made .	1
this great product getting bed head look . i use approximately dime size worth my palms go wild ! trust me , results great . if you apply too much , you're hair get oily . good thing this product washes out easily any shampoo	1
i long , thick , wavy hair loves frizz up . i tried every anti-frizz , hairstyling product out there , they either didn't work or weighed my hair down . i didn't want like this hair dryer hoping it wouldn't live up hype ... but , it excellent my hair . after using dryer ( no styling product ) my hair straight , shiny felt great . me , it didn't change amount time i dried my hair , so if your considering buying it speed , don't , unless you thin or short hair . it worth $200.00 price tag ? depends you personally , but i recommend you shop around because there better deals out there	1
i bought shampoo theory condition theory this redo freshen-up mist . i normal-type hair needs washed every other day -- if i use lot product , it needs washed every day . i very sensitive skin too . this mist worked very well my hair , definitely freshened it up allowed me restyle it quick blow dry . it feels awesome my skin . well , jonathan	1

my hair tends fall out due me not eating enough protein , so new ! ( hair ) lifesaver . others said , it lathers like you wouldn't believe -- you really only need roll it your hands two or three times get enough thick lather -- it amazing scent . ( sniffing bar actually bit addictive ... you smell it really strongly even before you open box ! ) i've found keeping it small lightly covered dish my bedroom , away moisture bathroom , best way preserve it while . ( also , it works accidental room freshener -- seriously , smell incredible ! )my only wish scent would last little longer my hair , since it doesn't really stick , even right after showering , unless i use lot lather , ends up expensive since then bar doesn't last long . most time , there isn't even much hint , whereas other lush shampoos make your hair smell wonderful , even bit overpowering , days . also , unlike some other lush products , it leaves my hair fairly flat . it true it helps making hair really soft shiny , but it seems opposite effect when it comes volume , that not so good when you're already some hair loss . using mostly scent-free conditioner after almsot necessary , least my experience . i think new ! ( hair ) terrific shampoo its hair-restoring qualities general sniffability , but same time , it could little better its more cosmetic qualities . buy it more former than latter if you want most enjoyment value out it . if you hair loss , trust me -- price worth it	1

this great product . only reason i don't give it full five stars it alleged not ' significant ' amounts vitamin , which supposed its selling point . i , however , buy it because five years or so i used this product , i gotten lot compliments firmness my skin , since i started using it my skin actually become less oily than when i first started using it . i first purchased this product because some damage i my skin using popular acne product . my skin looked felt though i burned acid . i promptly stopped using product purchased this cream cream cleanser because i hoped these products would soothing . they definitely . within matter weeks my skin started feel better . moreoever , it took plump , more youthful appearance ( no sagging ! ) . within month or so , my skin much less oily than it . since i first purchased this product i strayed but always come back . winter i use heavier nightcream experienced same results . regular cream pink color not smell perfume . texture wise it heavier than lotion but still feels slippery touch . i highly recommend you try this cream	1
word wise sizeif this your first time buying lush soap online , forewarned . you receive piece 1 " thick 4-5 " long . other words , you receiving fairly small piece soap . if you lush store near you , i strongly recommend you go smell huge chunks soap they display . once you find scent you like , buy � lb brick it . it cost little over $20 , but it worth it if you find soap you love . i also find it easier experience full scent soap bigger slice . i know lush stores few far ( closest one me 35 miles away -- not far , but too far convenient ) , but if you grab couple friends make road trip out it , it adventure ! now , rock star . what delightful soap . if you fan mmmm .... melting marshmallows bath melt , then you also enjoy rock star . scent same . it also same snow fairy shower gel creamy candy bath melt . i cannot quite place my finger scent . main ingredient it vanilla absolute , but this smells much more sweet girly . there definite floral scent lurking under vanilla , but i am loss try describe it ! it sort smells like warm cotton candy hint brown sugar . it closest i come trying describe scen t.t he scent rock star linger your skin entire day . it absolutely wonderful . it also leaves your bathroom smelling wonderfully fresh . every time my husband uses upstairs bathroom , he come find me ask what smells so good our bathroom . it fabulously creamy soap it lathers quite well . if you white tile your bathroom , it leave pink lather pile tile , but it easy enough wash off . there couple minor downsides rock star . but they minor : 1 . it melts way too fast . i just wished it lasted bit longer . 2 . it leave skin feeling bit too squeaky clean . when i first started using rock star , i thought it would give me dry skin , but hasn't case . it just feels bit dry after showering . despite these small issues , rock star perfect soap make you feel bit girly bit sexy , all same time .	1

like someone else said , i don't problem paying high quality beauty item works it says it . cinnamon buns great lather , smells wonderful when you use it , makes your skin soft . i used it shampoo scent lingers bit longer using it your hair , but it really doesn't function well shampoo it shower gel . bubble bath ya use so much it i just can't it . i find myself counting ounces i'm pouring under faucet decided use it treat only . smell doesn't last very long , but found it linger longer if you lather , rinse repeat , like it says bottle . it dollar ounce ..... not sure if i'll try any other ' flavors ' simply because cost	1

this best shaving product whole wide world . if you exfoliate first then use it , nothing gets smoother legs me my sensitive skin . yes , it seems kind expensive but you just need tiny bit time thin layer so it actually lasts longer me than several bottles regular shave gel . it also takes up less space	1
this product works very well my fair nordic sensitive skin . it covers well , but light , non-oily feeling , combined fluff og powder , it leaves my skin looking flawless . i highly recommend this product .	1
if i choose fragrance most feminine i've ever smelled , it would marc jacobs . yes , it gardenia based scent , but definitely not your typical musty , heavy gardenia any means . marc jacobs different it ' wet gardenia ' , like you're smelling bunch gardenias swirling around bowl fresh water . intoxicatingly alluring . notes this fragrance : gardenia , wild muguet , skin musk , cedar , ginger . gardenia this faint , but lovely . it isn't knock-you-out strong gardenia , but very mellow mesmerizing . it'll follow you like breath fresh air , you'll people sniffing air you leave behind . :) if you've ever smelled michael michael kors , this different . michael not gardenia , but it tuberose scent . it very strong , creamy , heavy , thick . if you like michael , you may like marc jacobs your spring/summer alternative . they're same family terms florals such , but different terms how they wear . marc jacobs flowy , michael heavy . 1.7 oz . retails $65 , 3.4 oz . $85 . it quite expensive , but it brand-name smacked front . :) i think it worth it . lasting power decent . even when you may feel it gone , it not , people compliment you . try it out see how you like it your skin	1
my boyfriend used search online stores french cologne jean patou pour homme because it only " upscale " cologne he would wear ( it awesome ! ) . however , it not produced anymore very hard find very expensive . he searched high low find replacement , this it ! sean john unforgivable surprisingly good . masculine , but not too musky or cheap smelling . now , this all my boyfriend wear - i'm not complaining ! guys - women love how you smell when you wear this . women - buy this your boyfriends/husbands , but only let them wear it when they're date you ! :) anyway , it worth cost , it our new favorite .	1
i never smelled any cologne good this . unforgivable absolutely wonderful ! i saw diddy several talk shows promoting this fragrance thought here we go ... famous person perfume industry - not gonna any good . so i go shopping other day see tester bottle . i try it . sprayed it little piece paper immediately asked sales clerk give me biggest bottle they . it amazing . my boyfriend comes home work , i present him cologne he wasn't thrilled ( not into colognes such ) , but promises try it anyway . he didn't hate it !!! that thrilled he gets anything , so i knew then it good thing . i just can't quit smelling him , his clothes , his car - everything smells unforgivable ! we went out some friends dinner drinks both my girlfriends pulled me aside ask what cologne he wearing - they wanted buy it their guys too ! now i can't wait women fragrance come out ... seanjean definitely winner here	1
i really like this conditioner lush . i wash my hair everyday , because this ( long soaks bath ) my hair gets pretty dry . this conditioner absorbed really quickly doesn't overpowering scent . i am not huge fan coconut , but this shampoo makes my hair smell like tropical cocktail which i think really nice . i wouldn't use it every day don't recommend it unless you dry hair needs bit extra care . i used american cream but i think coolaulin better , least my hair . i thick , straight , mid-length hair . great conditioner make hair soft but strong , also shiny	1
after suffering terrible cold all week i finally succumbed hot bath . i rummage through my box filled lush products ( gift thoughtful boyfriend ) when i pulled out this huge disc broke out half while saving other one more bath . i didn't even know what this called but minute it touched water , refreshing invigorating essences lemons milky cream escaped my nose , i felt happy instant , it amazing ! even thought my nose refused recognize scent days i smelled oils citrusy botanicals , bath water filled tiny bubbles i soaked my cold stress away . after bath i felt great , my skin bones felt refreshed i warm , cozy felt lot better . after looking it up online i really surprised see this called happy pill , because it really make me happy . i am really looking forward using other half , hopefully when i'm not sick anymore . once again lush came through me products they so lovingly create i cannot recommend their bath bombs enough . whether taken fun bath product or relieve cold or sadness they always work gentle relaxing ways . main ingredients this little love ball good skin nourishers such olive oil , hemp oil , grapefruit oil , bergamot oil , frankincense oil , lemon oil , grange flower absolute , mandarin oil , gardenia extract ( yum ! ) sodium bicarbonate . happy bathing ! - kasia .	1

if you love baths , but simply must bubbles , then bubble bars lovely addition salt soak . you also add one these or half bubble bar one bath bombs . i keep buying bath bombs giving them away gifts , which excuse buy more lush products ! i've tried numerous bubble bath products these seem produce especially fun amount bubbles . you literally hide below bubbles , there so many . you also get added benefit more essential oils . lush products , you may get journal just bath bliss experiences . there certain products you blend together create moods moments . ~ rebecca revie	1
china glaze my favorite polish , but perhaps it because they only ones i've ever seen this color #86 , your touch . it so gorgeous , i've compliments it nearly every place i go . china glaze seems limited retail distribution , so i've order it online years - this vendor perhaps best ever sending it out so quickly ! great job	1

i love auqolinas first ground breaking perfume " pink sugar " death but it such overpowering scent i am often smelled before i am seen perhaps such strong sweet scent isnt always appropriate . aquolinas new perfume " chocolovers " similarly sweet , but much subtler . if you love sweet scent pink sugar but don't like how you smelled 12 feet away , try chocolovers	1

i'm always skeptical " age defying " products , but this one really works . i've using it since it first came out ( maybe 10 years ? ) people often think i'm younger than i am ( 27 ) . i'm not really using it though - i use it because it unreal how good it acne . it prevents breakouts also heals current pimples so fast . when i run out , breakouts back	1

unless you super oily skin cannot tolerate any super moisturizing potions , you shouldn't use this . i oily/normal skin find even this dry lotion moisturizing enough me . it definitely not dry skins or sensitive types . kinerase products touted their ultra sensitive ingredients , but beware , this lotion contains retinyl palmitate which fact irritate your skin . though this seem deliver some skin smoothing , it not my opinion , good cream version which much better balancing skin , not contain retinyl palmitate . both good , but kinerase cream better	1
i using this product over year . only took couple weeks improve very thin skin under my eyes . little goes long , long way . one jar lasted me 4 months using every day . this product blends into skin quickly i use it under make-up . it calms my skin . i am happy this product	1
what brilliant package ! it squeezebottle brush end , twist lid . no spills , no mess , no disaster . love it ! it easy apply brush . i lava flow , which shimmery pink . shimmer more obvious than i would like , it big flecks sparkle , but it isn't so bad it looks like glitter glue . there strong smell taste , sorta tropical ; although it isn't unpleasant , it powerful . kinda reminds me red koolaid . color bright pink when first applied , but simmers down medium pink rather sheer . container color looks unwearable , but reality it isn't dramatic . only drawback how sticky it feels . it less sticky than mac lipglass , but more so than urban decay xxx , if makes sense . i got this freebie i'm glad i got try it . i would buy it but different color	1
earlier i read all reviews retread . paying 20 bucks conditioner not quite suit me . however , i using it month now i say reviews inadequate discription product . personally , i believe this amazing product . i used it combination big i believe my hair never looked better . retread superb conditioner really wonders . i virgin hair , but i blow dry it ever day so i felt heavier conditioner necessary . since this deeper conditioner i would leave it 5-10 min or while you all your other stuff shower/bath . my hair softer than ever afterwards ( could big though ) shined like sun . this not everyday conditioner but works well once or twice week ( i mainly use it special occasions , or when i just want feel pretty ! ) i highly recommend it i feel it works much better than lush conditioning treatments . only issue smell . i am not much into smell cucumbers me what it smelled like . however , this could just personal attribute no one else mentioned this . product still amazing though , i am willing endure smell(it fades day goes ) . my decision this product miracle ! hope this helps !	1
i sensitive , acne prone , combination skin ( oily t-zone ) . i've used various toners months time this first toner doesn't burn when i use it . it reminds me better smelling witchhazel astringent -i used witchhazel kid help prevent my skin breaking out . it nice fruity scent which great since most toners ( especially clinique ) smell like alcohol . i just wish it little cheaper ! bottle pretty big so it last me 3 months which makes price not quite so painful . i use it clarifiance oil free gel cleanser morning night	1

this mascara great , it easy remove little warm water , but best thing it it won't give you ' racoon eyes ' . there no dis-coloration skin around eyes . it also keeps looking great all through day , no need re-apply i t.t he only reason i am not giving it 5 stars , even though they come different colors , they all look more black than colored when dry . so color doesn't stand out enough . still , i highly recommend it	1

orris root powder scent similar violets although this tisty tosty bath bomb , even addition rose oil , it not overpowering fragrance . i think they could add double rose oil , but you add rose ylang ylang if you mood . tisty tosty heart-shaped bath bomb perfect if you enjoy blending your own essential oils or prefer mild/calming bathing experience . i'd suggest using this one skin calming also adding " romance stone , " " sex bomb " or " chelsea garden " bath bomb add little more romance bath . i feel emotionally calm ( rose balances emotions ) my skin loved this bath bomb , but it not sensory i'd hoped . following this bath " it pleasure treasure massage bar " fun , also heart-shaped . you may want try " violet " soap this bathing experience . next time i try this , i might mix it " elixir " bath melt bit " bathos " bubble bar , also scented violet . far this magic spell , you just never know who might call you when you use this bath . probably right when you bath . so , if you think this work instantly , you might want keep phone tub . it funny , but when i bath , my husband trying call me said he let phone ring ring . he really think i would leave pleasure lush bath answer phone ? personally , i think they should scent this bath bomb like it pleasure treasure massage bar . it blissfully delicious almost seems edible - looks like white chocolate ( it mostly cocoa butter ) heady scent orange blossom honey neroli . ~ rebecca review	1

while most sunscreens these days protect against sunburn , you know very few them actually protect against photodamage ? only two sunscreen ingredients protect against long uvai rays cause photodamage ( brown spots , wrinkles , etc ); zinc oxide parsol 1789 . zinc oxide protects broader range these rays than parsol 1789 . this skinceuticals sunscreen zinc oxide it goes without any white film or greasiness-perfect daily use face . while neutrogena dry touch suncreens feel more invisible skin ( you can't even tell it except smell ) good alternative ( parsol 1789 ) , i still prefer skinceuticals added protection virtually no scent whatsoever . since it expensive , i tend use it just face use cheaper ( like neutrogena ) sunscreen body when out sun .	1

this far most expensive relaxer i've ever used it worth every penny . i first heard it oprah relaxer so i decided hunt it down . one best things i've ever . i very coarse , thick " horsehair " usually defeats most over counter perms after few washings . not phytospecific relaxer . my hair stayed soft straight no matter what weather or i it . it healthiest it ever . no other relaxer ever my hair . fact they usually made it worse ! i absolutely love phytorelaxer i am officially addicted . if it less pricey , it would get 5 stars	1

this fragrance took me quite surprise when i first tried it magazine sample , so much so i knew i try it department store - this little over year ago . then i sampled it department store all my nose could think " wow ! " - gardenias my grandmother garden , suntan oils tropical perfumes i smelled little girl beach , few more florals blended make this fragrance even more exotic sensual - i knew i it ! i bought myself bathgel lotion set put large bottle cologne my x-mas list , which my sweet generous boyfriend got me . my opinion , this probably most alluring fragrance women i ever smelled . i feel very alluring every time i wear it my boyfriend - he loves it ! so this would great gift man wife or girlfriend , or woman best friend , sister or cousin ( long you wear it your own man , too ! ) , but slightly awkward gift give your mother , aunt or grandmother - it enticing . but if your single older relative or friend simply must it one her gifts , then it given one her female friends , sister , cousin or " santa " . way there won't any awkwardness gift-giving time . believe me - this fragrance olfactory equivalent french lingerie or string bikini !	1

i agree previous reviewer , smell candy like fragrance . i generally wear oscar or chloe , but this fragrance nice change . doesn't much staying power , though . it wears off fairly quickly . but it lovely scent .	1
i intrigued when i saw amazon.com also sold body products such perfume make up . how you review scent convince people purchase it ? i can't exactly post scratch sniff pad online . i say this one my all time favorite perfumes . it smells summery , light , fresh refreshing , somewhat like happy clinique . scent also lasts few hours , unlike some other cheaper perfumes . bonus packaging beautiful : perfume comes wrapped slender white box piece rice paper describes flowers few different languages .	1
i love this , so my husband . i bought entire kit which comes lovely satin mini duffel-like purse handle.it includes body creme , body wash , perfume.it bit strong introduction.it doesnt smell like pine-sol like others said . its like re-vamping original poison purple bottle . except this one sweeter crisper tone.it becomes light stays fresh time.id say its bit fruity/floral . good everyday or special night out .	1
i am my second bar this stuff now , wow-there so much i say it ! first smell honestly awesome second , after only week use , i got all these " baby " hairs cropping out over my head-this awesome me since , though i'm not currently loosing my hair , i strong family history hair loss ! i also very oily hair-the kind hair needs washed every day or i look like i'm homeless but after using this shampoo i skip day and-for first time my life-you can't tell it my condition my hair !! my only issue this even though my scalp oily , my ends dry i use just tiny bit cream conditioner it-also this item dissolves super quick if you leave it shower makes everything your shower pink ... but other than i strongly recommend this item anyone curious	1
this product really brighten your eyes when used eye powder , amazing ! worth money !	1
this scent bit softer than many men fragrances . it unique powdery scent . i like how it not too strong overbearing one spray . just enough so my girl smell it when she hugs me or sits next me . i also use acqua di gio it good contrast this scent . i get compliments both scents	1
i am one these people who hates make up , i am natural , but this yet clinique line i love love love . this almost lipstick great . it not leave nasty lipstick everywhere . it stays lips not my teeth , glass or my boyfriend . i love almost lipstick . it great	1
i'm true product junkie . i've tried more crap spent more money stuff my colored , processed , blow dried , ironed , wavy damaged weak hair then any sane human would ... but i think i finally found my soulmate product ... first i must say it smells divine like mocha coffee ... i use this product daily before bed every night morning after i towel dry my hair .. it only product i leave my hair after shower whether i wear it naturally wavy or blow dry it straight ... sometimes i add ojon gloss serum if i feel my hair needs it ... little goes long way , my past bottom bra thick hair uses size tablespoon ... since using this product 2 weeks my hair significantly shinier , softer , way less frizz , no more puff not porous.my color also looks more vibrant which great b/c it blonde getting brassy . i noticed results right after 1st treatment . i especially love it good your hair purchase contributions helps tribe central america who gather oil their trees . =) it pricey but worth every cent then some . you can't put price true beauty right	1

i absolutely love clinique eye shadow . all their eye shadows go so smooth , never crease , just perfect shades colors my skin tone . almost peach color great because i use it highlighter under my brow or just base , either way i use it just every day ! :	1
within two days using this cream , i waa astonished results ! my skin tone completely evened out , my skin appeared smoother than it ever my life . it add glow . i'm not so sure tha it really works eliminating wrinkles , but other effects well worth every penny	1
this shower gel works really well -- you use it general soap , it very mild , so you use it anywhere ( ah hem .. ) your body without it stinging , or burning . i haven't tried it shampoo . works quite well shaving . good consistency . smells exactly like fresh banana . more fruity banana scent , like tropical lifesaver , than baked banana bread scent , if helps any . pricewise , this actually one more affordable upscale shower gels per ounce , assuming you buy large bottle just one scent . also , this stuff preserves very well . i still some philosophy eggnogg (!) shower gel i bought holidays , i now used it through 2 christmases it still smells great ..	1
clinique products , key knowing your skin type . i took quiz [ ... ] order decide which products buy 3step system results showed clarifying lotion #2 appropriate option . i little worried when i read reviews amazon.com said it too strong given some individuals rashes , but i used it anyway . it works beautifully . if you buy this lotion get rash or breakout it because you didn't consult clinique source or unaware your true skin type . so long you buy right products you , it going everything it promises more ... i highly recommend it	1
daring provocative , enigmatic mysterious , delicious perfume much say . dazzling its spicy heart notes , karan message seductive perhaps even troubling . way go donna karan ! 5 stars you	1
finally i found delicious , light , everyday scent . not heavy or over-powering , this refreshing apple scent great any day .	1

this purchased gift my son 14-yr-old girlfriend valentine day . heart shape container , well nice color lip gloss made it perfect gift her	1
it probably smaller than one inch cube so it isn't whole lot gloss , but key chain so it can't too big . very cute	1
this classic fragrance , not your overpowering j-lo , b'spears , etc . i wish i could explain scent ... but it tough describe . it isn't fruity or flowery . perhaps bit lavendar though ? basically , you don't overpower room it . it bit " old-world " -ness it ... but far i am concerned , wonderful thing . i am 31 year old professional , i wear it daily out night , i just love it	1
i bought this product three weeks ago i seen great improvements my skin already . i never really used skin products but i living florida over 20 years i lot spots due sun damage . friend mine told me this product his wife bought him . so , i decided give it try it really shown great results ! spots my skin diminishing my face looks better . i decided try some other menscience products . my wife also started using product , so you may buy two	1

i received this lip gloss few years ago christmas present , then i couldn't find it forgot it . but friend mine this using this same lip gloss couple weeks ago i remembered how great it . this one best lip glosses/balms i've ever used . flavor fantastic moisture it gives your lips unbeatable . it not sticky , it not even really noticeable . it very " natural beauty " if you know what i mean . :	1
i extremely oily skin . it wasn't unusual me wash my face three four times day keep it shining . result oily skin humid temps ( i live . georgia ) , makeup would just slide down my face i'd end up feeling like i stuck my head crisco end day . friend suggested clinique though oil isn't completely gone ... which wouldn't desireable anyways ... it finally manageable . i got ddm lotion part three step program clinique offers , but i think lotion solely responsible changes my skin . i could leave or take toner soap , which don't seem any different than less expensive versions readily available drugstores . lotion though ... wow ! it doesn't go greasy or watery . instead , it nice light consistency easy smooth over your skin but thick enough it not hard contain or control your fingertips . soon you rub it , you notice mattifying properties . lotion actually helps reduce shine itself , but without any tightness or depriving your skin its moisture . some stuff i've tried past only dried my skin out temporarily then oil glands would really start kick vengence , but this lotion i haven't any those problems . my skin now smoother than it ever , oil glands apparently appeased well because i haven't wash my face middle afternoons anymore .	1
this product really apply like butter very rich moisturizers . i using it years giving it christmas gifts . i use it very rich treatment dry legs , heels , elbows . i love fresh mango fragrance . before bed , i often cover my feet mango body butter , slip socks , let good stuff soak overnight . then i feel very pampered i wake up soft feet	1
it seems no one escape . there times when even best tressed need help their hair . sun , sand , surf may leave you many happy memories , but it also leave hair looking like ... well , let not talk it . perms , coloring , all intended make us look better - let face it , sometimes leave hair dry lusterless . time get serious shea butter . frederic fekkai moisturizing conditioner shea butter rich , creamy healing potion less than healthy locks . it truly hydrates , smells delicious , nourishes damaged hair . if your hair thick , it also marvelous detangler . only small amount needed - simply apply after shampooing comb through . what difference fekkai makes	1
i am believer now . i bought this because i saw demonstration qvc . i really needed great scrub since i use spray tan great exfloliator helps . i'm not sure what amazing grace really smells like , but i liked this smell . its not over-powering not over-perfumed . its got nice clean smell . i bottle expensive peter thomas roth scrub but find philosophy brand actually holds together you feel scrub . there no dripping . this truly great rough exfoliator . warming sensation , i didnt feel it . buy it sephora where you return it if you're not satisfied .	1
i alittle hesitant first ... this my first lush experience , but soon well rewarded . i thick , curly , long color treated hair . so say its damaged understatement . hybrid worked major tho . i doesnt lather like your normal shampoo , so i concerned if it really working . it ... no fear . i use quiet few swips tho , because how much hair i - but still - ive this bar month now , barely see where its used . i store mine traveling soap case always let dry before closing dont store shower . i still need condition afterwards , but not much normally . when dry ... my hair just feels healthier less frizzy , but not caked down .	1

all philosophy line , i find this best consistency-wise . it much thicker than amazing or baby grace gels , leaves your hair skin much softer , smelling like ivory soap . very clean scented , not too girly .	1
this bath bomb little deceptive . it fizzed fast made water beautiful color . it smelled great . then i thought , ok this enjoyable three minutes until i get used smell novelty bathing purple water wears off . boy , i wrong . after few minutes i started feel sooooo much more relaxed . i already bathing plain , hot water awhile , so it wasn't just effects hot bath . this little ballistic something . my skin smelled great until i took shower next morning .	1

i never problem acne until my late 20s , when suddenly my skin seemed turn me . i found myself bumps my cheeks ( where my skin dry ) , around my nostrils ( where my skin super red inflammed raw looking ) , my nose ( oily prone blackheads ) , my forehead ( also oily ) . i tried several high-end drugstore brands none them seemed work . months it this way no matter what i . i tried proactiv , which dried my skin out horribly , stung while i applied products - i even used those products only every other day my skin still peeled ! i all set go dermatologist when i decided give philosophy line chance after hearing so many good things it family friends . i've using it religiously two weeks , while i can't say my skin flawless , it considerably improved . bumps gone down every area , my nostrils no longer red unsightly , no more blackheads , best all it feels great while applying after . each product also very little scent it which i liked well - no antiseptic smell here ! i find moisturizer wasn't quite enough me so i started using philosophy hope jar sensitive skin my cheeks neck . fact it cleared up my acne mostly but not completely my reasons giving it four stars rather than five . overall , i've very satisfied product intend continue using it quite some time .	1

love all items laura mercier spring collection - sheer madness . " sheer " operative word here - makeup subtle , refined very flattering . stick gloss rates ten all a me . what not like lip treatment soothes , smooths , plus adds color fullness ? stick gloss combination lip balm , lip color , lip glaze - three one winner . my favorite colors peony , deep rose , poppy , festive crimson . when applied each color much sheerer than tube color indicates . instance , peony appears burgundy tone yet lips it lovely rose . perfect warm weather tones .	1
i've used others past , but they end up losing their concealment power short time , or end up making me look shinier . this one easy apply ( it like drawing your face ) it stays long time . i really love it . :	1
thanks coverage play sticks , ! coverage significant my emerging age spots , yet play sticks not look heavy , chalky or cakey all . using play sticks , my face looks like i am using little make up , it sheer look dewey finish . problelm : finding my color online shopping ! it out stock i don't live up north where department stores carry benefit !!!! it so worth effort ! i love this foundation , i tried regulars : bobbie brown , este lauder , clinique , etc	1

i've got pretty oily skin - i always . these my absolute favorite oil blotting sheets . i've tried wide assortment other brands , shiseido ones truly best . i really like light powder sheets . you know it absorbing without leaving tons make-up left your face . i detest those oil blotting sheets which " rubbery " . hopefully you know what i'm referrring . i don't feel like those sheets actually absorb anything - more like push oil around . after using this product you visably see all oil grime removed your face . i haven't found anything i like better than these . 5 stars	1
burberry london definitely compliment-getter . it also versatile , it worn any weather any outfit . it notes peach , black currant , vanilla , cedar . please not judge this scent only sniffing nozzle or smelling scent strip paper . it smells nothing like it skin . allow it settle 5 minutes , if it works your body chemistry , you'll know right away . :o ) first sprtiz , i get peachy/cedar blast quickly mellows into gorgeous , clean , but warm scent . vanilla isn't sweet all .. just warm inviting . i received lot compliments this . lasting power wonderful ! end day , it only sniffed anyone who gets close you , but it developed into super soft , clean vanilla . burberry london expensive , but there lots places where you find great deals it . bottle very sophisticated , simple , classy . try it !	1
i ash brown hair few blonde highlights found dark blonde/medium brown color very natural . i used sephora slanted eyeshadow brush apply very happy results . it so much better than lancome pencil i used use	1
i'm so glad finally came out this gloss . my sister got this gift set . i wanted my own ( just gloss ) i got it off ebay . this gloss smells like chocolate , color subtle , it makes your lips tingle . color doesn't last long i would like but my lips look great dolly they soft when i'm not using this	1
i purchased this conditioner after used fekkai color-treated ( pink one ) version thinking it would even better my high-lighted damaged hair . while it still fantastic conditioner compared most market , i really thought pink one better job . both leave my hair smooth relatively healthy , but my hair honestly gorgeous after using pink fekkai conditioner -- shiny , bouncy , like i never colored it . maybe this one little too heavy my hair ? i haven't quite figured out difference . previous posters noted , this rather strong smell -- sort floral , almond fragrance -- which little stronger than most hair products . i didn't find it particually off-putting , but i prefer clean , simple fragrance pink fekkai conditioner . all all , great product , but i'll go back my original fekkai conditioner when this one runs out . i never thought i would say this $20 tiny bottle conditioner , but it totally worth $$ . ( comparison purposes , i medium-length , straight , dirty blonde hair highlights )	1
i bought this my boyfriend , he thinning hair he said it made his hair feel thicker more attached . i love smell , i contstantly sniff his head now . also shipping really fast	1
i absolutely love this stuff ! i purchased it bare minerals starter kit ( foundation powders w/ dvd all ) because i wanted some color add foundation . i think it worth your money - actually you would save money rather than buying all items separately . it nice you get your eye , cheek lip products all one kit . i particularly like buxom lips stuff can't get enough it ! it so minty , tingly leaves light shimmer . clear radiance great ! i use it blusher , if i wet it it makes great eye shadow base . eyeshadow brush fabulous ! i like how there two ends - one eyeliner , other shadow , although i also use eyeliner brush eyeshadow . gold glimmer great if you wet it comes stronger . my only concern it get messy - particularly onyx color which comes strong so only use very little . otherwise i think it great buy !	1
despite what britney spears might mean you , this one sexy perfume . it smells hot . all girls should wear this	1
i saw this local dept . store , quite intrigued unique packaging , name . i sprayed myself tester bottle , loved it , straightaway ! my hubby got it me valentine day , i use it faithfully . it fresh , crisp , green apple aroma it . not too light , yet not too overpowering . perfect balance . very girly . reminds me walk apple orchard , autumn day . good way get your apple-a-day	1
yes , this just water , but packaged wonderfully . i very dry , sensitive skin , little evian spritzers ( i carry one me all time winter ) help immeasurably . i spray little before moisturizing , or when my skin flaking . i always take these planes -- spritz my face every two hours -- find this keeps my skin drying out becoming too oily ( reaction dryness ) long flights . some reviewers scoffed this product , pointing out it just water speculating brand name draw . i don't drink evian water very often ( i prefer other brands , if i'm drinking bottled water ) , if i could find comparable product i would definitely try it out . similar products , like body shop face mists , tend scented irritate my ( very sensitive ) skin ( exception this face spritz boots botanical line , but hard find outside uk ); i've considered just getting spray bottle putting regular water it , but those tend larger , more forceful sprayers i don't want point one my face . evian brumisateur , you're getting just water , but that all you need ; it conveniently packaged , lasts long time such small bottle , i love way it feels . highly reccomended ( thank goodness they're carry-on approved , if you buy small size !	1
i love this fragrance but even when i layer falling love body wash , body lotion perfume spray , it seem fade lot faster than other perfumes . falling love really great scent so when i wear it - i continue refresh scent occasional spritz throughout day .	1

" marinating " oil not what you might imagine " oil " . it penetrates hair , treats scalp , smells really good ( very subtle ) doesn't feel heavy . it easy leave all night , washes out so quickly it instant gratification - beautiful hair . leave it great skin care company apply beneficial treatment properties hair care . this marinating oil also multi-tasks me . i use tiny bit rub it into my cuticles nails . i use few drops tame frizz before i use my flat-iron . i've rubbed few drops onto my hands feet when i've felt extra-dry . this good stuff ! i highly praise this product . this not just random addition confusing mass hair care lines . this serious * treatment * won't put shelf rest " things i've tried " . it worth it . i actually love my hair again . my color lasts longer , doesn't fade , shine just won't quit . it taken years years damage away . i blow-dry , flat-iron , curl ... without fry-factor . shampoo conditioner last forever . little really go long , long way . thank you again philosophy , you've yet let me down .	1

clinique " pore minimizer instant perfector " indeed change appearance your skin . it incredibly light , just touch glides your pores disappear instant . you wear it alone or under regular make-up even more coverage . i really think this great product it just what it says it . i recommend you use it no more than light moisturizer or else it won't able get your pores work its magic	1
not everyone wants smell sexy i guess , which why i caved gave 5 starts delicious smell ... no one mentioned this but overall smell reminds me coconut . i recognize this perfume other people it always distracts me ( good way ) . i would not wear this myself though . best winter .... it'd annoying spring/summer . now perfume which person not wear yet still give it 5 stars got something special :) . only one other perfume me , amairage i think ... would never wear it , but i enjoy smell others	1

i browsing bath body works store saw it , opened up " tester " bottle it smelled devine ! i know it pricey , but i thick , straight hair recently become very oily , even though i not use any products . first day i used it , i washed my hair blow dryed it , thinking smell would not last long . wrong ! it happened raining day when my hair would get wet , nice apple smell came back . my hair very soft bouncy . i purchased 18 oz bottle ( yes , sure pricey ) so far i've used it every day ( week ) . i try taper off maybe 3 days week , order conserve product . it keeper	1
this first foundation i ever bought actually matched my skin color exactly . i seriously can't see it all my skin ! it goes velvety smooth isn't greasy all , after minute or two , it feels totally natural , soft matte finish . i don't even use powder it set it . my only complaint very light sheer , so it doesn't really cover up lot flaws ( i freckles around my mouth it doesn't cover ) , but it works fine little concealer . i haven't noticed much way line reduction all , either , i'm sorry say . but still good foundation itself	1
i usually add salts bath oil my baths well bubbles add skin softening properties .... but this bubble bar , i don't !! it pink , it smells so good , water bubbles feel so soft against my skin !! i absolutely love this one ~ i tried many , lush brand others ~ so much i got rock star soap matching scent . i say , however , i found it necessary keep it fridge during summer months although it arrives solid-i live florida so humidity makes it soften bit more than i'd like cabinet . overall ? 20 stars !	1
you won't find these unusual nail colors any other brand nail polish . these colors long-lasting , durable , offer great shine	1

this most invigorating facial/skin product i ever purchased . it gentle enough use your face leave it polished smooth ( note : use only once week if you dry skin ! ) . if you've long day work , or mall x-mas shopping all day , grab ocean salt scrub . rub it all over your feet instant foot massage don't forget rub your hands , well ! you soon decide this lush product you cannot live without ..	1

most masks made clay seem dry out so fast you hardly time put them your face before you need wash them off . they also only seem serve one purpose , drying out your skin or removing oil . there some leave your face feeling nourished this one healing clay masks . i sensitive skin tendancy towards either dry or oily - guess it lovely combination skin problem . so , this mask seems deal both issues once - removing dry skin deeply cleansing pores . mask magnaminty made bentonite , water , kaolin , honey , phaseolus angularis seed powder , evening primrose seeds , peppermint oil , flower extracts , vanilla fruit extract chlorphyllin-copper complex . this fun use bath or shower while you shaving . put it few minutes , let it dry slightly then rub off dead skin cells . seeds provide exfoliating power . almost immediately upon looking mirror after leaving tub , i could tell this mask healing powers . dreamwash , my skin looked especially cleansed calmed . i recommend both you if you need skin brightening calming . these two products seemed work well together create radiant complexion . you may also want try prince shaving cream dream bath bomb . figs leaves soap also very moisturizing . ~ rebecca review p.s. if you find someone rub this all over your back , it feels so good easy wash off yourself later ( unlike some clay masks i've tried ) .	1
i bought this lush product due high reviews other lushies couldn't wait get home try it . when i opened pot , first thing i noticed color - it little turn-offish , but don't let stop you slathering your entire face it . smell amazing not too minty or strong . like previous review said below , it smells like mint chocolate chip ice cream . i put mask all over my face ( you put it your neck back well ) , lie down 15 minutes get full spa feel , then wash it off shower warm water . i find it much easier shower because when mask dries , it takes some rubbing get it off . when mask , your face tingles mint feels so refreshing ! when mask rinsed off , your skin feels even better . great cleanser exfoliator one ! sure keep eye out ' best ' date because this only shelf life 4 months	1

this day-time fragrance i can't live without . i'm type person who doesn't like things smelling too florally or girly-girl ( e.g paris hilton or maria sharpova fragrances , which don't suit me all ) . same time , i don't want something that too " mature " leaving me smelling like old lady ( too strong musky ) . eau des merveilles somewhat in-between fragrance that hard describe very unusual . it woodsy but it amber , pepper , citris notes . it refreshing , modern , chic . you don't need overspay this stuff either . it potent you'll probably mistaken wearing cologne if you overkill it . people like how i smell this fragrance , some even say i smell like " clean laundry , " which good thing ( me atleast ) . you should try this stuff sephora or fragrance dealer before buying it though . people body chemistrys ( amount perspiration , oil production , foods they eat , etc . ) make perfumes smell differently . spray it seell it after few hours .	1

time come - time some serious reassessment my skin toll time elements taken it . i'd read ads lancome line - absolue - which stated it " one product addresses effects chronological aging .

" she right ! i went back get more ( several months later ) , sephora no longer carries this brand . luckilly , i found it here . bubbles fragrance long lasting , no harsh chemicals or greasy residue left bathtub . fragrance nice but not overhwelming . bubbles full lasting ... they won't end up mound your feet . somehow , they're distributed all throughout bath water ... just waiting you slide ! you don't need use lot bubblebath , which good .. because price .... but even small amount , you'll tub full bubbles !!! enjoy !!	1
it hard find perfect skin products , but this one flawless my opinion . it not heavy or greasy goes skin just perfectly . i tend sensitive/combination skin now use this treatment everyday . i strongly recommend it	1
i fekkai product , loved it so much i wanted take look what else dear frederic offer . i've always wanted product would put waves my hair , but every one i tried before just made my hair stiff , crunchy , icky looking ! i read good reviews this product , so i decided give it try . it amazed me ! my hair really doesn't much natural wave- maybe one or two semi-waves back . frankly , if i leave my hair air-dry without doing anything it , it looks like cave-woman hair ! but not this stuff ! i towel dried my hair until it just damp . then i sprayed it all over my hair , flipped my head over scrunched . ( if your hair tends get frizzy , you may want add little cream- such fekkai glossing cream- this product doesn't much combat frizz ) then i blow-dryed low just minute or two while scrunching , let rest air-dry . i few pieces hair front quite damaged coloring , waves weren't defined there . but rest my hair- wow ! i never imagined such fun waves my relatively straight hair ! frederic fekkai genius !	1
get dramatic look extend your lashes three times their natural length this mascara . it doesn't irritate comes off easily night	1
i got it , i love it . simple . i little suprised there wasn't much lather , but it get my very thick hair clean . upon further thought i took reading ingredients again , it mostly all natural stuff . kinda makes wonder what rx bought stuff ??? try it , yes , it fragrant but i like it . however , it could overpowering some , especially if you over sensitive sents	1
i skeptical first . i mean , shampoo/conditioner bar ? i haven't super impressed lush other solid shampoos or conditioners ( least , not enough write review , good or bad ) , so i doubtful this 2-in-1 bar . but i loved idea , i curious , so i bought it i must say godiva far surpassed my hopes ! my hair shoulder length , it only took 6 or 7 good swipes wet hair work up incredible lather ! ( 3 or 4 swipes wasn't enough , 10 too much ! )my hair felt clean , but not styrofoam-squeaky clean where * everything * stripped your hair . conditioner light , but doesn't really kick until your hair dries . i don't personnally recommend using hair dryer , so i don't know how would affect conditioner , but air drying worked great me . i also recommend it travel since it size your palm , 2-in-1 , won't leak ! ( only warning i'd give shampoo tin . i got it free , so maybe i shouldn't complain , but ... let shampoo bar dry before putting it into tin !!! it pain get it out if you don't . ) i also love scent , but could too strong some people ( or not strong enough ) . everyone different , but if you don't live near lush store , you'll never know until you buy it ! :	1
i don't know why so many reviews say they get six or seven shaves . aren't you using hot shaving soap ? i average european beard . i shave shower each day mug soap bristle brush . key . i get good hot lather going . lather just keep your whiskers wet soft . using merkur blade , i get well over fifteen or twenty shaves .... or more . i don't really keep count , but one blade lasts me least four weeks , i shave daily . i reluctantly change blades when it seems it bit dull .. but i think i could use it much longer ... honest . i can't imagine spending three dollars multiblade razor good seven days . love my merkur razor , too	1
fragrances marvelous , yet after shower they not interfere your scent choice . i find shower gel very creamy not drying all . i use it well shampoo , but found dry harsh winter i still need conditioner . i highly recommend this product	1
entire line fabulous , but rose zircon lip gloss far best . i never one wear lipstick , but since i first tried this lip plumping gloss , i rearly leave home without it . it doesn't feel like you wearing anything , yet it stays while eating drinking . rose zircon matches my lips all my friends who borrowed it not returned it because they love it so . it just makes me feel glamorous	1
it shiny ? oh yes , it . my hair dull boring after week using this shampoo , it shiny lustrous . like magic . i scared use solid shampoo but all you rub wet bar top wet head lather form	1
smell only caveat me , it little bit sour/bitter/funky smelling . thing i find strange i use alot this feel like i've saturated my skin . i go through it pretty quickly compared other spray type toners . whole hauschka regimen so amazing my skin . use , spritz after cleansing press gently into skin	1
i stated my other reviews , i color-treated otherwise normal hair which wavy prone frizz . i like this shampoo it calming effect , best experienced after couple uses . if you straighten your hair , this work great because shine smoothness most noticable . those you worried your boss may think you spent your lunch break pub - stout scent fades quick only really identifyable while washing . word wise , this shampoo bit drying . i make sure deep condition least once week avoid crispy hair .	1
i love this exfoliating cleanser , especially way my face feels after using it . i even used it my feet .... remarkable ! i love every murad product i tried .. but this sure one my favorites	1

while it seems these days most shampoos specific purpose ( ie- volumizing , de-frizzing , curl-enhancing , color-protecting , etc . ) this one amazing all-around shampoo , wonderful daily use all types , colors styles hair . smell incredible - truly invigorating wake up morning shower . it doesn't leave any buildup or residue many shampoos often , so you don't worry switching your shampoo every few weeks . its great classic which i hope stays around forever- i'll remain loyal fan !	1
i don't like liquid eye shadows because they seem wear off but thisstayed all night all colors pretty it also worked great liner under my bottom eyelashes . i don't care wand it goopy i used eyeliner brush apply . also little goes long way	1
this stuff goes easy , stays well ( but rub off water , won't withstand good cry ) . nice . not quite nice victoria secret liner ( i swear stuff , discontinued 3-4 years ago ) , but way better than anything cheaper . i tried other things . plus , won't irritate my very sensitive eyes	1
i received smaple size this face creme my recent order my hunny anniversary present estee lauder . it came bunch other stuff i either swapped or gave away , but this real winner me . it came 5-day supply , i just wish i more . i used this creme supplement other lotions i wasn't thrilled , namely , neutrogena whip moisturizer spf 15 or 30 , clinique super city block spf 40(but i'm still undecided this one ) . both these weren't smooth enough . they didn't nice slip spread easily across skin . former i use lot its owen really moisturize lower half my face , latter i rub very hard order get it spread without this creme . i love this creme gets job . out all moisturizers i used my face , i use this one most sparingly order moisturize , i like . i imagine it coests more than other two moisturizers , but it also better job . i don't like when i first put it , it seems warm up my face bit around nose mouth . ordinarily this wouldn't bother me , but seeing how almost every other thing breaking me out recently , it makes me teensy bit paranoid . howver , this sensation not persist , so i don't worry too much it . other thing it takes alittle longer sink into skin , until it , it gives my skin look if i sweating , but then it my skin just feels good . isn't what moisture all ? recommended : yes amount paid ( us$) : gwpskin compatibility : improved my skinfragrance : pleasing scent	1
i'm usually drugstore mascara girl -- my current fave maybelline full soft -- but i opportunity pick this up cheap , so i decided try it . immediately , i liked thinner-sized tube ( can't stand those overly fat mascaras ! ) stiff-bristled brush . product bit dry side , but i much prefer wet gloppy . there wasn't too much product brush , it easy apply . i definitely noticed lengthening effect beyond what i've seen any other mascara , which great because it made my small eyes look much more open . also , product stayed put all day long , absolutely no smudging or flaking . my only slight disappointment it left my lashes looking bit thin , effect long spidery ; i guess i'm used fullness i get my everyday mascara , full soft . i continue use definicils times when i particularly want more length , i've found i layer it my full soft get both length fullness i want . i would repurchase this if i could get it discount again , but i would not pay full price	1
deep clover votiva nicest aroma any candle i sampled . it not over-powering yet it job . it warm , sensual fragrance	1
i don't know what i would without this mascara !! this mascara me beyond best i ever used , ( i my share investments other brands mascara only sadly disappointed ) . i would give this product 10 stars if amazon would let me . i confess i carry this mascara me everywhere ( not you re-touch up during day -- because you dont , but just so i won't ever lose it ) . truly product worth trying .	1
i got this my boyfriend , who works all day lifting heavy plants nursery . he loved it minute i applied it his sore back . smell calming , spices warm up sore muscles like icy-hot patch , but much better . it melts easily into skin , but lasts long time . it feels so creamy warm . now he always begs me give him massage	1
i bought solution 2 roller ball it works very well . refill amazing deal i love this product	1
normally our house , we threaten wash cats ( they don't like water too much normally only peer curiously into bathroom when i'm tub . now then they played bubbles ) , but this amusing name . i think it more like " honey , i lost soap tub again . " this one melting dream soap easily slip away into depths luxurious lush bath . this soap good think pink bath bomb some creamy candy bath bubble bar . if you love this , you may simply faint when you order sultana soap ( oh my ! ) . avowash ( avocado olive oil ) , ooh la la ( lavender ) bohemian ( lemon ) also fun . ~ rebecca review	1
loved scent feel this soap ! i'm bath product junkie my latest cravings anything honey scented this soap wonderful . my only complaint it use up pretty quickly left mess dish . i'd not leave it shower next time .	1
if you tried such products proactiv help clear up your breakouts haven't impressed , try this line murad products .

my mother bought this perfume me two christmases ago . first i thought it too heavy . however , once i started wearing it i fell love it . i've never received so many compliments perfume my life . men women randomly stop me hallways , restaurants , street ti ask me what i am wearing . " you smell so good ... " i wear it everyday now am my third bottle .	1
every time i wear amor amor lots people ask me what i'm wearing . it my absolute favorite fragrance i got great deal it . thanks , annett	1
so true this product . i admit when i first saw price tag this product , it half out curiousity i purchased . i mean could pair $20 tweezers much better than ole $1.75 or $3 pairs home ? well if your asking yourself question , yes ! these things amazing grip pull tinyiest hairs . things you would dig normal tweezers until you finally rub your skin raw . without doubt , you get your moneys worth this product well amazed their performance . it type " wow " makes you feel like , " how i ever get without these before " . worth every penny i'll never buy cheap tweezer again . these lasted years still retain their fine point .	1
tweezerman really best tweezers market say , cutest . different colors choose , fact they're reliable strong only adds them . tweezers gone dull you need them sharpened ? you don't need go store anymore buy new ones . tweezerman sharpens them free charge sh so long you send envelope . my final point : i don't see point buying any other tweezer since you buy one pair it lasts you rest your life	1
i am definitely beauty junkie . i tried probably every volumizing product market ( including much lauded phyto volumizer ) but i absolutely love love love this kerastase product so much ! it far best ! it leaves your hair silky smooth tons volume ( even after blowdrying it 15 minutes ) . it doesn't leave behind gummy or sticky residue . it little expensive but it lot bang its buck i would even pay more it if i . i never use anything else again !	1
i really long hair i use lot conditioner . this good treatment winter when my naturally blonde hair starts grow out bit darker than my summer haircolor . it doesn't lighten hair very dramatically all its own , but it conditions very well smells really nice , like lemony custard . i use this warming it slightly microwave so it sinks better , then applying it dry hair . i tie my hair into bun wait twenty minutes or so , then rinse it gently , wash my hair using blonde shampoo , condition light conditioner . if you don't really want your hair lightened much just want bit extra shine highlight your blonde hair , this great its own . if you want more dramatic effect , blonde solid conditioner works stronger effect . blonde drying though so i like use them together	1
it delightful remind spring , daises true love during cold dreary winter months . i love using this set while traveling , bring back home memories make it easier away .	1
i've fan roger et gallet soap ever since i went paris late 1970 . products world class just thing make one feel like king	1

i rabid fan lush products years , often them shipped me form canada before they so easy buy states . each product certain earthy quality it its nice knowing people who make each every single these luscious concoctions love them much customers it shows ! karma soap looks like slab gold shape but really reminiscent candied carrots i would find fruit cakes i used eat kid growing up poland . clarity fiery jewel like color quite attractive it makes nice soap put guest bathroom or self spoiling hand made soaps beat other cookie cutter types mile . scent itself breezy breath citrus mother earth embedded deep core . lavender patchouli whisper , shadowy backbone zest freshness . multidimensionality layering scents makes fore very uplifting experience i smell heady aromas every time i my hands it . i also love karma perfume , which smells almost exactly soap . i find my hands don't get dry when i use this glycerin soap opposed regular soaps laden chemicals lards . but i always use hand cream afterwards , preferably one those gooey burt bees creams come heavy glass jars . my hands never crack or get dry no matter how dry air or how cold it when i used lush soaps good hand cream . - kasia .	1
i make my own hand body soaps , so i'm pretty picky anything store bought . i given this sample order lush , i loved it instantly ! i haven't able duplicate smell exactly my own soaps , so i am willing buy it just alone . i'm not fan patchouli general , but it doesn't smell strong this soap . it blends very well other scents smells divine ! my entire bathroom smells great when it hung up drying shower . i highly recommend it even given others karma gifts , too	1
this cologne smells great ! it much more appealing than chanel allure sport , versace blue jeans , or ralph lauren polo . if you like slightly stronger , sophisticated scent , this great option	1
i initially bought sympathy skin because smell ( i just love it ! ) reviews i've read . i really excited get home try it , but little disappointed . lotion smelt wonderful , but when i used it , my hands felt like lotion didn't really sink it . sympathy skin left slight shinny coat my hands felt little oily . first i realized i using too much , so i started use less really cut back oiliness . since i use this night time , it not big deal , but i wouldn't use this day cream because it little heavy me . besides oiliness , lotion work well really helped moisturize my hands , which usually dry cracked because so much dishwashing . i follow lush lemony flutter cuticle butter my hands never looked better . try some lush other lotions first before i buy this again . overall good product	1

this scent very light sugary . i enjoyed it because i prefer fragrances more spice-based than floral-based , this scent note sugared almonds stands out me most . it good summer scent because it isn't too heavy it very sweet . i gave this four out five stars because while it enjoyable , it just didn't certain ' something ' makes fragrance truly memorable	1
i love this ! it powdery , clean smell isn't overpowering- but even if it , i could probably stand smell it all day long ! i used maybe 1/4 bar , but it still made nice masses bubbles ! unfortunately , bubbles disintegrated pretty quickly ... i didn't mind though , didn't feel it worth taking off star , because it left my water scented my skin soft . this something i wish i could use every bath	1

all i say wow . i'm 24 . my first razor same kind de razor my dad used ( some gillette ) . around 17 mach 3 came out since full knowledge shaving never really handed down me , i opted mach 3 which easy use gave decent shave . i've essentially stuck mach 3 until now , but generally unsatisfied closeness my shave i decided investigate turned back safety razor picking up this merkur hd . i just used it first time it turned out significantly more satisfying than i hoped it would . i nicked myself few times without really noticing so there some learning curve but now i've only used it once i tell you it won't take long get it down . couple thoughts : 1 ) i'm really glad i went hd . i thought hd may heavy ( it may compared other de razors ) but i wouldn't want it any lighter . it already feels light my hand . 2 ) biggest thing keep mind shave razor cuts keeping it perpendicular your skin . most notable difference shaving mach 3 . merkur hd centered around this . mach 3 i kind feel like i drag blade across my skin ( kind scraping it ) get close shave ( which i don't notice much irritation ) . said most shave hd close , but since aim keep blade perpendicular , razor felt more like it gliding over skin . very nice . 3 ) put new blade you unscrew bottom top part comes off . you pop blade , put top back screw bottom tighten top . it should noted i've started shaving night so i tell what i'm doing ( i'm not morning person ) so morning if i'm not really going pay attention mach 3 may still better . also , i'm using cheap soap boar brush cvs until stuff i ordered comes so any luck it even nicer next time	1

this soap awesome . what i like it it doesn't sweet scent it . fact , you really sniff it smell it . it leaves your hands feeling super clean hydrated , if you just put light lotion ( but without feeling something " " your hands ) . what i not like this soap it leaves reddish-brown film after you use it . i buy special soap holder ( one little " pillars " hold soap up so it doesn't touch surface ) so it wouldn't make mess . i really like this soap , though . it winter , i like anything keep my hands smooth soft without use lotion	1

i've only used this twice so far ( last night this morning ) but already i've noticed my skin not oily it really soft after i rinse it off . i'm intrigued entire lush product line - glad i stumbled upon this . i've got some samples way ( won off auction site ) i can't wait try them . also , this seller awesome when ups some reason thought i moved . when i called lush live person answered phone called ups me . ups called me within 30 minutes offered bring it out night . wonderful !! my skin oily lg pores blackheads - go ahead give this try if this sounds like your skin . only drawback it little messy side but not too bad	1
i dont know what they put it , i just know it works . within three days getting this product chicago lush store , my face cleared up beautifuly . i've really awful skin , blackheads , whiteheads , deep cystic acne , since i around 14 , i've tried anything i could get my hands take care it ( proactive , everything else ) i problem finding product would clean up my super oily skin without irritating it because its very very sensitive . this trick beautifuly ( followed up some celestial mosturizer after some hardcore exfoliation ) made my face feel very soft smooth after washing instead all itchy flakey . my pores also looked noticably smaller well . plus it smells great	1
this super-rich bath those very dry skin . melt basically oils , luscious scent , some soaping or foaming agents make oils disperse into bathwater not float top like they would otherwise . it sometimes little too rich my skin , but i love scent so i use it occasionally anyway just rinse off afterwards some rock star soap . scent lovely rock star scent , vanilla-y candy scent kids also love .	1

while sephora looking new nars lipstick , pretty dior rep approached me . i would normally declined her offer mini-make-over , but i feeling rather adventurous wanted update some my make-up items , so i followed her her chair where she went work me . i say , past , i nonplussed unimpressed makeovers like these . but when rep handed me mirror , i gasped . even under harsh lighting , my complexion looked pretty darn flawless youthful grandmother trying hold any vestige good looks . i bought foundation , finishing powder few other dior goodies . i figured i would probably use it few times realize it didn't really look good me home or office it when dior rep my makeup store . then i would experience buyer remorse continue my quest perfect foundation . lucky me , i wrong . this product become one my top choices foundation . it doesn't settle fine lines around my eyes , or my pores . instead , it what it says -- smooths out my complexion . color chosen me looks natural no lines demarcation . coverage what i prefer this stage my life . i gave it 4 stars instead 5 because i am still searching this type lush coverage gives my combo skin less shine mid-day . but now , i finish using bottle , probably purchase , which something i haven't other foundations some time . my biggest tip this foundation little goes long way . dior rep used make-up brush tends give more sheer , even coverage . $50 , it wouldn't seem bargain , but if you use it i've described , it should last you several months .	1
