this seems like great idea - food held basket , so you don't shove skewer through meat . however , little bolts hold down clamp onto rack meant tightened hand . if you sizable chicken , you cannot tighten these enough hand . i chicken fall out rack into flames more than once . then you tighten them pliers , but metal so soft you only this 2 or 3 times , then threads stripped whole thing useless ! again : hand tighten = chicken falls out ; tighten pliers = threads stripped . now i try get replacement parts rotisserie weber . good luck	1
photo amazon isn't representative product i received . frame white , or extremely light silver . i also bought lacrosse technology wt-3122a 12-inch wood atomic analog clock , which didn't match it photo either , but least i like it .	1
don't waste your money ( even just 10 bucks ) . plastic not rip-stop tears very easily . i now just use big , heavy duty , black trash liner - they much stronger	1
$80 this ? seriously overpriced . if you find something cheaper buy it , this not worth 80 bucks . clamps not capable holding small boneless ham without slipping . worked well ribs	1
me , lacrosse technology wt-3122a 12-inch wood atomic analog clock little value . i talked friend living colorado who very satisfied equivalent clock , but i am new york much further away transmitter it just doesn't work my satisfaction . when it first put wall kitchen didn't work several days , i contacted technical support . they suggested i put clock window . i followed their suggestion after 2 days clock set correctly . i moved it back kitchen wall now 7 days after change daylight savings it still eastern standard time . i didn't purchase this clock hang my window . i need clock kitchen . soon i find suitable replacement this one going into garbage where it belongs	-1
this seemed like pretty slick idea , pretty clock . all it needs let us know our stomachs aren't lying , it really near lunch . i set it near our front ( glass ) door it apparently found signal it changed time itself spot . so i hung it our office ( no window ) . two days latter we thunderstorm one night . apparently interfere signal . rather than sit tight wait fresh signal , this thing off odd amount time , like hour 27 min next morning . i set it manually , today it off again hour . instructions reset which i got tech support not less than 7 steps long included detailed disertation what type battery , what it expiration should . man , that lot work just verify what my stomach knows true . $25 , packaging gone , this dumpster . i'll get regular clock only keeps time couple minutes month .... but takes month show error	1
not expect much 10 bucks ... but give me break , 2 weeks plastic streched tore around handle up top smoker . i think heavy duty trash bag what this product equivalent	-1
i purchase my unit little less than one year ago now i am shopping different brand . it worked fine first summer season texas , but now it spring almost summer -- it not turn all . i completed all manual troubleshooting addition purchasing new bulb cable it . but , it not work anymore after only 1 summer usage ! i not recommend !!	-1
while clock works quite well resets it should , wireless outdoor thermometer way off . i base this two other wireless brands i own , acu-rite oregon scientific , local noaa weather broadcast , also wfie tv . acu-rite temp = 18.2 , oregon scientific+ 18.5 , noaa broadcast temp @ 20:09 jan28/07 = 18f , local tv station wfie-tv = 18f . [ ... ] i write this , weather channel also reports it 18 degrees 20:30 . la crosse ws-8256u-al reports it 23.5 , more than 5 degrees off . my opinion , clock/thermometer costing this much should dead . buy it time , not temperature	-1
i this smoker since august total 20 hours smoking it . i noticed thermosat starting burn out after 4 hours use hour 20 it gone rendering smoker useless . other problem i porcelain coating inside cooking chamber all pealed off leaving bare metal exposed . dealing charbroil get it repaired or replaced useless . start it nice easy use smoker but problems encountered i would pass something better	1
i ordered this piece matching chairs . i waited since july them available . they became availabe september , so i ordered them . they kept moving delivery date then canceled chairs - said they couldn't get them . so i cancel sofa well . now i am stuck 2 chaise lounges coffee table but no other furnitue !!	-1
cover i received much shorter than pictured . someone else same problem . i sent it back , it seemed pointless . i am using my old weber cover . it doesn't look real pretty , but it provides outdoor protection - which point	-1
after opening weather station setting it up , i noticed numerical display not readable missing " characters " . i contacted amazon returned it . within 5 days replacement arrived same problem . when i contacted them again , they would not replace it again , saying " batch " they must defective . i not aware amazon selling " seconds " other retailers . phone call lacrosse remedied situation . they advised me send defective unit they replace/repair it make sure it perfect before leaving their premises . they further advised " fail ratio " problem i both units less than 1% . beware if buying this amazon	-1
i bought this thing put it my garage month . one night i saw mouse running across my stove so i brought it put it directly stovetop . later evening i washing dishes , mouse ran back forth behind my microwave his little cheeks full shake'n'bake right past rodent repellant five times !!	-1
repeller works fine repelling , but when " rodent " setting it makes audible chirping noise that annoying so it used only remote locations where people don't normally go . reason we bought this model because it run batteries we wanted it outer shed , but manual says it'll only run two or three days battery power , making it absolutely worthless this use	1
i disappointed these tongs , which surprising since oxo makes good kitchen utensils . i agree other reviewers , it difficult grasp close them . unless you rather large hand ( which i don't ) , you're forced grasp handle so far down near stainless steel ! when comparing these my 12 " tongs my hand grasp same point - which really made these 16 " tongs no different 12 " ones .	-1
good news it mostly works -- although weather forecast , advertised , only 75% accurate . unfortunately , it some annoying flaws . 1 ) although it provide either 12 or 24 hr format either celsius or fahrenheit temps , you can't actually select temperature display -- once you select 24-hr time format , you get celsius temps whether you want them or not . if you want deg , you must select 12-hr time . 2 ) if you run clock off batteries , you press button get any projection . unfortunately button you press snooze button , which activates both projection backlight ; button control brightness projection not work battery mode ; activating both lights simulaneously both redundant wasteful , it runs down batteries more rapidly than necessary . 3 ) worst all , device emits very annoying , very audible , high-pitched whining sound any time any button pressed ( including snooze ) anytime you need set or reset anything . 4 ) manual confusing ; information website not tell me anything i needed know . emailed support -- no acknowledgement , although i eventually got response it wasn't remotely helpful , i already given up them returned device	1
this product waste money . mice my room completely unaffected , walk right device without any sign concern . besides ineffective , devices themselves make slight buzzing sound ( not silent advertised ) . i now buy set ( humane ) mousetraps , i recommend anyone reading this same save themselves $40	-1
my smoker arrived dented chipped , which i wasn't happy but i could live -- i don't expect relatively inexpensive outdoor oven maintain its new look after some wear tear anyways . however , rails sides hold shelves not welded together well . fact , two rails arrived completely broken off ( opposite sides different levels ) third tenuously held place single weld . i thought broken-off rails parts used oven assembly ; otherwise , i would not unboxed smoker put it together . i would returned it . because i assembled unit before realizing it broken , i thought replacing broken parts would easier than disassembling unit , re-crating returning it . i called distributor three weeks ago order replacement parts not yet arrived . i've already waited longer than distributor indicated i would before receiving parts . if alternative gas-fueled smokers didn't cost multiple what this costs , i'd really angry . hands down , this most unsatisfactory purchase i've made amazon . spite impairment not fully functioning smoker , i seasoned it used it once . chicken i made promising . ( my hope my experience this smoker improve lets me award rating 2 stars based this one use . ) if i ever get parts i need , i think smoker adequate initial experimentation this kind cooking . if i like results , i'll replace this smoker better one	1
editorial review states its big enough two heads rest it . it would more informative if you stated dimensions pillow !	-1
i live apt nyc , so roaches very common problem . after long battle i finally got rid roaches my place , but i cannot escape bugs visiting other apartments . i thought this device could help problem . also , i don't like use spray too often or all baits , gels , other poisons around , so i decided try these things . unfortunately , they don't work . first week i bought them i saw big roach crawl under door walk directly under repeller straight dining room . ultrasonic frequency nothing it . instead this repeller i use limonel ( orange peel oil ) safe alternative use when children present , it repell kill bugs . so , how get rid roaches ? seal every crack nook cranny expansive foam , wood sealer , etc . mine came through bathroom kitchen vents , so i put mosquito screens block their way , also i sealed gaps wall electrical outlets apt silicone i bought plastic stripe closes gap door floor . also , my husband sprays once every 4 months repellent . good luck	-1

not buy this planning leave it outside your grill ! there warnings this product saying it shouldn't left outside , but i figured it couldn't bad . couple months later , i discovered my cutting board ( left covered porch through mild california winter ) completely split into several pieces . $30 outdoor product , this really unacceptable . plastic or metal cutting board would worked much better	1
chair good back support fits 6 ft tall man well even little extra wood support head . my stool arrived wood split so check it before driver takes off if you . mind instructions when you putting it together . if you don't watch bolts small blurry print step step notes you get turned around . also , wood almost orange it color	1
very disappointed this item . only two eight lights work they only stay hour . there plenty sunshine here new mexico charge them up but they still don't work just plain worthless	-1
this basket not stainless steel advertised . it merely chrome plated . i returned it immediately dinged return shipping costs other miscellaneous fees ' error not our fault ' . amazon continuing advertise this item something it not despite alerted discrepancy other consumers . i believe qualifies this error entirely their fault . this not level customer service i come expect rely upon my dealings amazon	-1
well , hansen gas-mate ii quick disconnect adapter temporarily solve your bbq connection issues , but only temporarily . what inevitably happen you suffering my fate . upon emptying your tank , you going find someday you this adapter stuck threads tank . there no place grab adapter wrench or pliers get good grip it turn it . save little plastic inner piece comes it you get adjustable wrench around square outside turn adapter out while , until day comes when torque required too much plastic inner piece . i would also recommend greasing up both sets threads , ones new tank ones hansen gas-mate ii adapter . don't overtighten it putting it into your new full tank . this adapter bad design weber . this adapter should come either strong metal inner piece helps you remove it , or it should some portion adapter itself its outside operates like nut serves grabbing point wrench	-1

look my other reviews other meat tenderizers made lot better than this one would more worth your while . i say it flimsy because it so skinny . other ones wider base offers more stability when you're stabbing into cuts meat . this smaller one also means you stab meat lot more . i say just get larger one that more stable takes less effort	-1
i grill year round many weather conditions . unlike gold platinum grills , silver grill not carry handle keep it shut transport ( see review burnt down car ) , nor it ability prop lid wind/rain shield . silver grill works fine nice weather fast , hot cooking , but if you want grill drizzle or little wind , ability prop lid up ( available gold platinum models ) essential . i lost my gold grill . last night i tried cooking little rain silver grill , it wasn't up task like my gold grill . i'm going buy gold or platinum grill this time	1
this item came me much i tried , only way i could view numerals ceiling see them upside down . there no way turn unit so it would project so i could read it my bed . i tried placing it both sides bed but didn't work either . it seemed me , guts unit placed wrong . there only one way move projector . so , i cannot recommend this item . i sent it back	-1

i " ez-up " 10x10 ' shelter my back yard , when one crossbar broke , it broke 2 others . if anyone sitting chair my back yard , they'd become shishcabob cheap thin metal used make these canopies . although ez-up sells products their web site facilitate holding these canopies down wind , they not cover any " wind or rain damage , " although this , my view , not factor why frame failed , company first response when i called get return authorization after it failed only after 8 months use , they quickly stated " we don't cover wind or rain damage , cut me off , apparently no reguard anyone safety , stating if it raining or even slightest wind ( i think it failed around 2 mph " winds " ) , their " warantee " not cover it ! they said i could send it they would determine ( after paying outrageous sum money send it back ) if they might replace it , but they likely would not . people company rude , no concern their product some safety issues , so i'm looking buy something less expensive , lasts longer ! interesting , they told me they don't cover any wond or rain " damage " , yet they also sell hold-downs it states their web site ( apparently directions i never received mine ) not fold it up if it wet , but leave it up ! i much less expensive shade latested much longer i'd recommend others same , or buy industrial model clearly stated their warantee product withstand wind up " " mph it made withstand rain well . after my experience this company product , their staff returns dept ., i would avoid ever buying one these again ! i received mine gift ( cost my friend over $200 ! )there much better , sturdier , safer canopies out there . if i could give this product zero or negative score , i would ! these canopies not nearly sturdy i recall them years ago ( or perhaps brand ? ) i expect these canopies recalled time due safety issues . i would strongly recommend buying something less expensive sturdier	-1

i recently bought stinger uv15 . it worked well one month ! month i followed recommendations cleaning it keeping it clear dead bugs . well just shy one month grid completely failed so it attracts bugs , but doesn't kill them . this product not worth money	-1
my second one now ... not i liked it much first time , just it only brand they sell local store here . i say while it worked , it worked ... i mean , it killed some bugs ! these , however , my problems it : bulbs burn out fast ! like after four six months ... replacement bulbs almost much i paid whole unit ! thing gets jammed up bugs there no easy way clean it . finally , it doesn't appear very weatherproof . first one died after storm one i now just died . i think i am buying different brand here ... one works more than few months	1
i one other weather station la crosse seems work ok , but this thing paperweight far i am concerned . it shows it raining out when sun out ! it constantly losses contact remote sensor temp humidity seems always off . i attempted contact la crosse , but other reviewers said , lost cause . they never answer any emails regarding product help or issues , no one seems answer their phone either . maybe i lemon , but i feel what they charge their products , la crosse should more responsive their customers	-1

i bought wmr968 2/10/2005 today , 2/14/2007 , only indoor baro-therm-hygro still works . anemometer replaced under warrenty 11/2005 . this service took 2 months complete oregon sci . anemometer then quit 12/2006 oregon sci . said tough luck it out warranty . thermo-hygro quit 2/2007 once again , tough luck . my thoughts unit besides it not functioning after 2 years : cheap cheaper . manual nearly worthless . anemometer accurate 60 kts . then gets wildly optimistic . temp ., humidity , baro seem accurate . rain gauge kinda funky way it reports because delay built resolution but it useable . all failures i i think related water intrusion into sending units . everone green corrosion pc boards when taken down rooftop . sealing units very poor use phone cords very cheap . i just got off phone , again , oregon sci . juan customer service told me " we can't help you " . if you want weather station made cheaply , no customer support last less then 2 years buy wmr968 . i guess price compared professional weather stations this thing attarct lot people but buyer beware	-1
i spent several months 5 purchases trying find good set tongs my husband who pickiest " bbq expert " ... these one worst . not buy them . locking mechanism clunky . they not open close smoothly . oxo 16 inch tongs much better lighter . you want tongs hinge vs ones permanently open waiting you squeeze them around what you trying pick up . good luck . i send these back	-1
i bought this clock expecting it : show humidity room ; show temperature ; set itself daylight savings . it neither above . temperature stays 60 humidity measure it always way off . same room i alarm clock all above accurately . clock attractive easy read it keeps time ok . but it should more . i am very disappointed	1
okay here my indepth review . i little flies some sort my hydroponic vegie greenhouse . i bought this seemingly easy little hunk plastic make sound that only bothersome little animalsand bugs hear . 4 days after purchase little guys seem flying ultrasound . jig bop back forth like they dancing .... i bet they dancing , making love reproducing ultrasonic waves ! i killed more bugs inhaling while plugging this my green house . rather then take it back i suggest you huck it black decker exec robbing us telling us this thing works . box they site study but don't show it reference . when i called bd they said , " we don't know what study info came " . they hornswaggling us ! this gonna big like enron ! corporate karma ! update- 7 days later . i really wanted give this product chance i'm lazy beyond belief plugging stuff right up my alley . if i go buy lady bugs or pest spray i'm gonna pissed . soooooooooooo i bought 4 more plugged them all 3 more days my small greenhouse ...... not damn thing happened . actually i think it works like rave extascy flies . there more them now they seem much more fun ! so conclusion , this thing sucks more then suckiest thing ever sucked suck . only buy it if you need some extra plastic hanging your outlets .	-1
i purchased two cushions use small chairs . when cushions i arrived , i could hardly believe how small they , smaller than description stated . addition small size , cushions lot stuffing seemed more like volleyballs than chair cushions .	-1

i am sorry i bought this thing . it way too complicated set up , yes , i read instructions ... they only added my frustration . i would not recommend this product all think 3 times before purchasing anything else this manufacturer	-1
product promises good results , but instruction manual very unfriendly confusing -- printed such small fonts one needs magnifying glass read it third hand execute steps indicated . unfortunately , average customer , i only two hands . after several attempts , i still not able make display light up permanently onto ceiling . i look forward resolving , but problem you need combination obscurity room view display ceiling , but light instruction manual read it	-1
i bought this january it worked beautifully until daylight savings time came around . now it hour off ( one hour less than it should ) won't reset daylight savings time . there button resets it if you don't daylight savings time but it dosent anything either . removed reinserted battery following instructions endlessly but it stuck hour short until fall . no reply manufacturer . beautiful clock but useless half year	-1

what joke , not worth money . i put it container pull out oil it dies half way through . swapped batteries , pulled it out , washed it looked all parts . it either used resold me amazon , or it defective start . since they 30 day return policy , i am now stuck it , i see what eastman says next . very disappointing , i go back old way just pouring it into funnel coffee filter it	-1
following quote direct oregon scientific wrong : " illuminated blue back-light means you never fumble around dark , lcd automatically adjust light room , so you read it when you need . " we keep our clock accross our bed , led not readable , there we couldn't reach it press light button ( which only lasts 8 seconds ) . i took it into completely dark closet led not light up all ; clock could not read without pushing light button . apparently there no way keep backlight . unless you intend keep this clock within reach so you press button turn light ( which only lasts 8 seconds ) , you don't mind not able see led across room , this might not good choice . i returned mine due above deceptive product description . regarding projection : temp reading larger than time ( which doesn't make sense ) , image only few inches tall within readable focus ; also , it doesn't show up clearly textured walls	1

field biologist involved hummingbird studies sw , i say red -- or any other color -- dye nonsense ! not needed , quite likely harmful . also , i question instant nectar -- instructions say it doesn't require boiling . there preservative it retards yeast bacterial growth ? if so it would likely extremely harmful gut hummers : it could harm their natural internal flora	-1

this clock worked fine .... until congress changed timing daylight savings time . i three other " atomic " clocks two weather stations all them reset themselves new dst except this one . i've " forced " number resets removing even changing battery . each time this clock goes one 4 , 8 12 positions sits there until it receives signal boulder . then it resets itself but always standard time , one hour early . i'm eastern zone so i can't " cheat " it into showing correct time this model doesn't provisions set it manually . la crosse makes big deal their website how other manufacturers leave you lurch dst thing but they it covered . not . when you try contact them they don't answer their phones ignore customer emails . look elsewhere	1
this item not functional i thought . i miscalculated size which not big enough my purpose . also , brittle like surface cracking peeling off . i going exchange or return item but packaging discarded too soon	1
my husband so excited , when he got this station could not wait get it set up . he phone guy so he wired it all up under house spent many hours setting it up just right , only issues wind barameter . we tried trouble shoot online handwritten manuals . unfortunetly there no one contact nor there option return this product once you it out box .. sooooo needless say excitement gone ..	1
you should remove this merchant . they numerous complaints multiple websites . i ignored it trusted amazon brand . however , my experience horrible - they over charged me when i called rectify issue , they weren't interested trying solve problem , but simply place blame me . then service rep hung up me . i'll never business them again .	-1
ugh ! i agree , this thing never going ship !! i am now looking similar products . not happy this all	-1
this product my knowledge completely untested . i suspect it because it says it requires no boiling -- which sugestes it may contain preservative , yeast and/or bacterial inhibitor . this could not possibly good hummers . listen experts such sheri wlliamson ( peterson " hummingbirds north america .

i bought this item because great price , amazon shipped it regualr ups i received it earlier expected , box looked good shape but when i opened it one legs broken off , i thought first it must taken pretty good hit , so i called customer service they sent me return tag shipped me new one right out , i got it , opened it exact same thing , box good shape but 1 leg broken , i called customer service again they shipped one out , this time second day air . i get third one guess what , exact same thing third time ! i looked it carefully each time it broken weld two areas cooker it poor workmanship quality control , it even looked like it rusted one weld ! i can't say enough amazon customer service , but i wouldn't reccommend buying banjo cooker mail order	-1
i received lacrosse weather station gift . it started out working ok 4 weeks . plagued software communication problems i not recomend it anyone . tecnical support team little or no help . it all goes back old saying , you get what you pay . very dissatisified customer .	-1

i this watch few months , feature wise it meets all my expectations , but i snagged it my backpack other day strap pins came off . no big deal i thought , i'll just snap it back - that when i noticed strap holder ripped through plastic casing thus unrepairable . over few months i it , it also discolored badly fake metal casing . great features , poor build quality . not recommended	-1
i use this bbq mesquite lump charcoal grilled excellent steaks , smoked some pork ribs , chicken , london broil giant hamburger so far . no marinade , just dry rub grill . book included accurate cook times long you keep temperature needle " i " ideal much cook time possible , which not hard . make sure " cure " it before you use it . this burns off all smells chemicals it manufacturing . cure it using propane burner . easy assemble too	1
i got this go my new silver weber i best chicken ribs i've very , very long time . it extremely simple assemble , operate most importantly , clean . i've two different rotisserie ovens i dreaded use based cleaning factor alone . cleaning this quick easy . small parts get clean simply placing hot , soapy water sink . i plan using this lot .	1
i bought this clock last week . amazon prompt shipping it time . received it i place aa battery clock selected time zone place it wall after some time clock second hand hour hand started moving fast . it actually searching signal . if it gets it immediately time set accurately 5 minutes . if not every hour clock searches accurate time relayed colorado server . clock finds time signal within next 4-5 hours . chances clock finding signal high over night when there less distortion . once ir receives accurate time it never fall behind . very good time piece	1
i return my 1st order due mould wood ( around joins ) inside glass front . my replacement little mould inside glass front , but i decided i could live it .. i blame amazon storage this rather than manufacturing it lacrosse . glass front spherical , so tends get weird light reflections , so watch this when you hanging it . note when battery low , second hand move 2 second jumps let you know battery low - this feature , not problem , which i like . other than it works great ! ( i live close boulder nist , where radio signal comes , so also take this into account when ordering any radio controlled clocks ) .	1
brush works well large enough keep you burning your hands . metal attachment perfect size cleaning weber grates . you can't go wrong this product amazon price	1
brush good job loosening grit grime your grill , but you still going break down wash grill soap water now then . brush strong wooden handle , leather loop , sturdy set bristles , grill scraper tough jobs . sure buy this longer brush 12-inch one not reach , especially larger grills	1
this clock set itself within few minutes worked well few months we've it . i loved not climb up get it down re-set it daylight savings time ! just so you know , this clock not silver color ( i thought it picture ) . it more pearlized off-white	1
i've bought two these atomic clocks . first , 12 " wood framed model , soon stopped keeping accurate time started acting unpredictably . second , this model , my wall week keeping good time after easy setup : insert battery , push est button . i am nicking it star because it makes noticeable tick sound quiet room , making it inappropriate bedroom	1
i found no issues . i put battery hit " et " it set keeping great time	1
considering i purchased this item my bedroom , i would say it perfect . aesthetic reasons i preferred analog wall clock , but thought hearing second hand tick all night not option until i found this item lacrosse . it could not anymore perfect , its looks , price , self ( time ) adjusting qualities made this . " m.f. " ( major find ) . now i sleep through daylight savings time adjustments not worry actual adjustment my clock , but whether or not i hour early , or late work	1
cover exactly what i needed protect our smoker weather . it strong appears durable . i felt price fair this product	1
this good rack ; it cleaned pretty easily nice compact size but ribs just bit too close together ( i cook mainly full spare ribs ) . i rib racks steven raichlen perfect . more spacious racks allow better basting , heat distribution more even cooking . when meat touches like weber rack , meat doesn't cook well	1
great looking quite large . easy see distance , though other two dials correspondingly small . updates quickly automatically unfailingly accurate . i wish i dozen them . price very reasonable also . i certainly buy more these clocks eventually .	1
this grill works great everytime ! only problem i lighter , but it not big deal . easy use , always give great grilling experiences	1
works great . cooking space grill holds large amount meat , fish , etc .. we would like see canister holds more gas than cooking only five meals .	1
purchased rotisserie basket after reading other reviews . i found basket work great . you put your meat grilled clamp down pieces . very easy . rock cornish game hens though , i needed tie them little bit , but because little legs . . . well little . never one before just skewer kind . cleans fairly easy too . love it .	1
weber products well made 9891 gas barbecue rotisserie no exception . ' basket ' style nice design .	1
no longer my wall clock wrong because power shortages or because i failed set it or reset it correctly	1
one thing which mystifies me how few people embraced latest modern clock technology : radio controlled clocks which keep exact time automatically synchronizing themselves signals broadcast incredibly accurate u.s. atomic clock boulder colorado . such clocks not only always accurate fraction second , they also automatically set themselves daylight savings standard time appropriate . furthermore , such clocks typically quite reasonable price . yet while most americans , example , latest modern cordless phones cell phones , relatively few accuracy convenience radio controlled clocks . this model just one many styles sold amazon other vendors . try one i think you'll glad you . my wife i several these clocks throughout our house take accurate time granted , no what time system effect	1
i give this 5 stars because price right name brand . it works ... it no better or worse than any other grille brushes i've used	1
item great quality last long time . exactly what i intended it	1
needs near window get time signal	1
really goes good my room . i really like it automatically synchronise per time zone daytime savings ...	1
i purchased 2 these clocks now . moment i inserted batteries clock started advancing stopped 4 ' o ' clock . i getting ready ship it back thinking it bad clock . but within 5 minutes both clocks received transmission corrected themselves exact time . so moral story don't return clocks without giving it some time it looks like these clocks stop 4 doesn't move all till it receives time	1
someone mentioned this just glorified trash bag . it not . it pretty durable careful use last long time	1
keeps ribs searing . lower profile than most rib racks so it easier turn rib	1
bought this use my weber smokey mountain . i almost bought sunbeam rib rack half price local home improvement chain but it seemed lot flimsier . this rack solid built weber quality . one reason i can't give it 5 stars because sunbeam rack skewers potatoes i would really like see this rack . if ribs too big , i just wrap them around wrap quite easily	1
i love this clock ! it big enough see all around back yard , looks great . keep mind they recommend keeping it sheltered extreme weather ... we ours under upper deck , so it sheltered rain . that extreme weather gets here los angeles	1
used it tri-tip last night it came out wonderfully . cranked high initially heat it up , then we left it low it kept 400+ degrees no problem ( it actually got too hot according my instant read thermometer ! ) . some complaints here say burner too loose . that because they used wrong washer mount it ! there one washer that larger than others . use wrong one it'll loose	1
these very handsome umbrellas appear sturdy well constructed . i like mechanism raising lowering umbrella -- very low tech smart . my one " issue " them really not their fault but my own inexperience what look -- they totally stationary , don't tilting feature . might standard , i just don't know , but i would wanted flexibility . oh , wood nicely stained brass fittings rather shiny but thankfully basically invisible . they're simple put together take apart . great price they block sun look terrific	1
we ordered umbrella replace one we many years . when product arrived , we surprised quality product such small price . we very satisfied	1
while 04 ' model performer slightly pricier than latest 05 ' model , there no comparision two models terms design , function , useability . if you want best charcoal grill made , your choice should 04 ' performer !!!	1
this most awesome , wonderful , fantastic grill there out there . everyone knows charcol can't beat flavor , but it bummer get started . weber outdone themselves inventing this amazing grill . it super easy start coals , easy keep clean looking fabulous , easy empty ashes , easy move around deck ( out our frequent seattle rain ) . course food we grill comes out delectable . i am grilling whole chicken tonight using indirect method . snap this grill ! it well worth price . we love it !!	1
grill wizard grill cleaning brush job cleaning grill better than any brush i've ever used . very little muscle required clean grill , especially if you clean after you cook when grill still warm .	1
if you're looking get your first smoker , look no further . since it horizontal-style smoker , it also double bbq pit/charcoal grill . plenty room , very versatile . treat it well it give you decade use . reason i can't give it 5 stars because thickness metal . if it little thicker , there would much more heat retention . you buy smokers 1/4 " + thickness , but expect pay least $600 . this easily best smoker its price range . make sure you season inside smoker similar how you would season cast iron pan . any smoker , before use , paint interior smoker shortening or vegetable oil , then start up smoker let it smoke couple or few hours . also , you should almost always keep chimney vent all way open . use intake vent firebox temperature control .	1
i bought this my bf christmas gift . he likes bbq little propane grill . i guess i should read measurements tools . they more suited huge grill . but its better than them tiny . good quality build . might want buy nicer package put them if giving gift .	1
worked designed , veggies , fish , small stuff cooked nicely , basted easily , etc . little large - hard close weber grill handle sticking out , it important keep grill closed . bit hard clean , too , but that just how these things . this one several similar units give good service . davi	1
i've used lot grill covers my time . this best - looks like it outlast last few i've tried just couldn't make it through year hot arkansas sun ! colors neutral though green more olive - but i didn't buy it color - bought it durability - course 6 months trial not make	1
off-color didn't bother me . i expected after reading all reviews . i agree it could 6 " lower ground . however there 3 " flaw stitching one seam . bead duco cement sealed up , it never seen back side grill . heavy duty material looks like it stand test time weather	1
i placed ws-8249u atomic clock i bought couple months ago next this one , they both showed different indoor temperature humidity . this one displayed lower humidity ( 47% vs 51%) higher indoor temperature ( 80.4 vs 78.9 )than ws-8249u . i no idea which one more accurate . out door temperature displayed same because they both received same signal transmitter ws-8249u . ws-8256u smaller than i thought it . i prefer ws-8249u ws-8256u because it nicer larger display .	1
keeping this smoker up temperature chore until i invested heavy duty 25 foot extension cord . i bought 12 gage 15 amp 25 foot chord i'm now actually using thermostat back off temperature . i got this cord lowes it cost around $18 dollars . manual says use 50 foot or less cord your smoker .. but it makes sense use short cord you . also .. thanks tip previous reviewer drilling hole bottom smoker allow excess water drain out . got go my ribs almost .	1
i just got this turner it feels really nice my hand . grip feels very comfortable turner very nice solid balanced feel . i got this turner so it would work better cast iron griddle i got . i tried out tonite cooking burgers it felt easier flip patties than normal cheap spatula . i felt like short order cook !	1
overall , this outstanding grill . i've it year , it awesome . it gets hot quickly , it sears food well , it all bells whistles . stainless steel grates primary reason get platinum not gold . they worth it , unless you want use plain cast iron constantly oil them ( which also you'd buy ) . couple things consider though : 1 . design kind retarded smoker box . using smoker box rotisserie chore , you can't really open smoker box because spit , smoker box seems want rely grates ( which i remove use rotisserie ) so grates gone it tip over easily . 2 . grill blown out few times . i think this due fact i don't follow instructions turn gas off when i'm using it , i just turn grill off . so regulator protection mechanism gets tripped , off grill goes . so i've changed way i use it , it hasn't blown out since . 3 . there these weird chains doors cabinet . i no idea what they , no one able tell me . so , if i it over again , i'd get exact same grill , it worth every single penny .	1
i am extremely happy this . perfect accent lights my front planter . i definitely buy set side planter . price right but shipping costs little too high . well packaged delivery .	1
i bought my genisis silver six years ago . despite some abuse me ( not covering it when it raining , ignoring grease fires while watching tv , not cleaning it regularly , not replacing flavorizer bars ) it still going strong continues produces most delicious burgers , steaks grilled chicken ever . i'm really glad i invested weber not cheaper brand . size , me perfect . you fit lot meat this grill	1
i purchased this grill my husband four years ago we still very happy it . it held up very well . when we problems it lighting back burner , i called customer service they extremely helpful . they saved me buying whole new burner set explaining me how remove tubes , check clean them . we now replacing racks flavorizer bars ( $60.00 ) since they just too hard clean after all this time . i found replacement parts home depot lowes which plus know i easily get parts . i don't see us haveing buy new grill anytime near future	1
i'm happy my grill . putting it together wasn't hard . it took me under hour also , but one thing note when putting right bar container make sure container placed properly before you completely jam bar or else it very difficult remove bar properly place container . grilling great , flames consistent . cleaning pain though , but i think thats pain all grills .	1
purchased this cover protect my new weber q300 grill . fits like glove ! strong durable construction superior protection .	1
well i like cover , but i it hard put . i hoped it would slip over grill easily . it not , it tight fit . quality cover excellent . i just wish they made it little larger so it would go over grill easier	1
you can't beat it when all you unwrap it use it ! cover high quality , perfect fit product ( odd shape all ) looks great fully protects grill . i highly recommend itgt	1
exactly same original grates came bbq . arrived fast packed well .	1
this umbrella quality belies its bargain price . it assembled easily opens/closes smoothly . construction seems sturdy , fabric smelled freshly laundered when it came out shipping crate . my only complaint , it almost trivial , resin finial faded rather quickly sunlight . i'm overall quite pleased product i'm looking places my yard utilize more these	1
we replaced old , larger broken sunbeam " bug snapper " this unit . this lighter easier handle . we're southern arizona , so our bug season just starting . unit works great , but upon encountering really big moth it sizzles long ten seconds . . . kind gruesome . if you're dealing night-flying insects this solution	1
i used flowtron products years . this year coudn't find one locally , purchased brand ! lated one month andhad replace bulb . new bulb lasted less than month . total cost twice flowtron bk-40 . flowtron bk-40 last " one year " 24-7 year around . like car , weatherand age takes it toll . but you'll need clean deadcritters off every other week . finally , found flowtron onamazon . thanks , no critters around my house , big or small	1
this thing works great . i prefer keep bottled beer hand so i never chance make beer chicken . chicken i cooked came out perfect . crispy skin juicy inside . excellent ! i'm going dry lemon juice wine next time . bottom tray holds all grease so your grill stays clean . highly recommended	1
this grill greatest simplicity ease use . it compact portable , so there no unsightly grill always hanging around your house or patio . i use it summer winter , even set it up snow . if you charcoal grilling exclusively , i , this grill flexibility adjust combustion air exhaust suite what you cooking . high temperatures , such steaks , i leave top cover off . takes perhaps 5 6 grillings before one learns all right charcoal loadings vent adjustments necessary . cools off totally 15 minutes if you close all vents .	1
umbrella i ordered fine , just what i hoped it would . however , i subsequently ordered umbrella stand ( after you prompted me so ) when it arrived two tightening screws shaft damaged shipment . each screws plastic knobs knobs broken off . result when one tightens them broken plastic sharp enough cut skin . i tried unsuccessfully find replacements hardware store . any suggestions	1
enough cheap looking patio umbrellas tear bend after 3 or so thunderstorms ? try this one ! very nice design , looks great , simulated wood finish pole , easy open close . we very satisfied	1
my old grill well over-due replacement , so i started doing some research into replacement . my previous grill coleman , lasted good 10 years , although cooking quality definately deteriorated . i going purchase " cheapy " grill , but my research , i noticed something - almost every weber owner rated their grill 5-star , whereas cheapies usually mustered three stars best . little more research quickly pointed out why - webers may not last any longer than cheaper competitors , but 10-year old weber still cooks better than cheap ones when brand new . i invested " platinum " . but yet use side-burner , so i'm not sure how valuable . i delighted quality grill - it easy assemble , cooking quality - fantastic . i purchased weber griddle , i also pizza stone , these two additions , i cooked 8 meals row my weber , including bacon eggs , home-made bread , pizza , course , grilled steak	1
first thought spending $750 grill seemed insane . then i started adding up all $250-$350 grills i've buy 7-years i've owned my home . based reading hundreds reviews , i figured stainless steel grill made weber would last grill i'd buy . i think i might right . i bought natural gas version , which i would highly recommend . no more messing around propane . just turn valve you've got flame . i've grill outdoors 4 months now ( somtimes covered , sometimes not ) there no signs any corrosion anywhere . stainless steel cleans easily polishes up nicely . drip catch system higher quality than i've seen , ceramic coated ' funnel ' drains juices down tin catch pan . nothing collects near flames so flare-ups minimized . ' flavorizer ' bars immediately incinerate any grease falls them . grill easy dismantle cleaning . fron t-t o-back burners provide perfectly even heat lot it . thermometer grill easily spins past highest marking 600 degrees . these temperatures steaks sear nicely grill almost ' self cleaning ' since any stuck-on food almost completely incinerated . anything remains grill easily scrapes off stainless steel grates . fron t-t o-back burners also allow you use grill like oven . shutting off center burner , you use indirect heat cook food without searing it . insulated hood keeps heat inside which makes grill more efficient but also makes it easier stand next while cooking ( not much heat radiates around grille ) . i'm convinced this grill excellent investment	1
i through atleast 3 grills prior this one . i type person would buy $200 job sears or something figure i'll get five years out this one . never . 2-3 seasons tops . this grills you know last . solid , stainless steel , warranties more than couple months . its built last gaurenteed last aleast five years . it worth every penny you spend .	1
you may wonder why it took me 20 years write this review ... well after using this rotisserie all time , motor finally stopped working . so , i got new motor this week . i'm ready go . i cooked just anything you put stick . everyone says , results just phenomenal . i've 16-21 lb turkeys , standing rib roasts , leg ' o lamb , pork roasts , chickens , duck , goose , you name it , i've cooked it . just put food , add few hot brickets every so often , let her o.o ne tip , there two ways cook this . if you want even heating , don't take lid off too often . releasing heat lid off you lose " convection " effect , but that not all bad . some meats , like leg lamb , where you want outside crisp , keeping lid off works well if you stoke your fire keep it hot . finally , weber customer service phenomenal	1
this far best grill accessory i every gotten . it cooks chickens perfection keeps them juicy moist tender . i haven't tried cooking anything else , but i'm sure whatever it it would come out great . i would definitely suggest this anyone who weber charcoal grill	1
just purchased weber platinum b4 grill , ( should bought through amazon too , thats story ) , so i needed cover keep it nice . bought it saturday arrived wednesday . very nice cover , very thick , almost rubber like vinyl cover . they improved cover since last one i received weber . they enlarged opening way allow cover easily fit over grill , this huge really , it used like wrestling alligators get cover over grill now it almost falls over grill hangs there . anyway summation it very thick , fits installs really easily looks great , absolute necessity investment grill thats now over thousand dollars	1
plain simple - very effective . i plugged this device wall my office school . within seconds roaches our kitchen area ran into hallway . they not seen since . there not any mouse droppings around either .	1
you put up 6 shelves inside fully use all cubic space available . but you may just need 4 leave lower two open big size items stored . rubbermaid similar size shed but it only accept three shelves waste lot spaces . rubbermaid shed uses much fewer pieces assembly than this one . assmbly pretty easy if you follow manu but it take some time ( 1-2 hours ) . after i finished assembly there some rain inside try except couple water drops . only concern its sturdiness since it assembled 28 pieces so far so good . i don't expect it stand ternado or hurricane . one thing i wan alert you : when you buy shelves measure inside ignore manu since if you buy side according it yuo find shelves shift too much left or right . you want them more stable , right ? recommended .	1
i tried rotisserie i got auction , sadly disappointed . mounting brackets not fit , there no counterweight , meat forks cheaply made . this unit however , great . first , mounting brackets truly " universal " , should fit just any grill . mine mounted perfectly my aussie bonza deluxe 3 grill without issue . installation only takes 5 minutes . mounting brackets allow various distances your grill mounting holes , multiple sets holes allow various height adjustments . if your grill two holes either side , you should se t.t he single-piece spit rod heavy duty , counter weight included heavy enough assist balancing heavier roasts ( or chickens ) , four-pronged meat forks well made . motor comes long cord ( 3 feet- most other units much shorter cords ! ) , fact motor on/off switch nice plus . lastly , all praise i give this unit , i also pleased it attractively priced . i seen many other rotisseries seem much more expensive , not built nearly well	1
i found this smoker great . i am not pro , so take my opinion such . i bought this last week put it together 1/2 hour . only problem i flimsy weld control panel broke , which meant it not hook onto bottom smoker neatly . it nothing little electrical tape could not fix , probably my fault forcing it . i plan fixing it bolt nut later this week . rest unit looks well built . far smoking , it great . i put some garlic water water pan , mix apple mesquite wood chip bin , put smoker low . long i vent wide open it stayed 175 . if i closed vent temp got up 200 . whole chicken i cooked great . after four hours smoking my back patio , chicken moist delicious hint bbq . it smoking pretty good couple hours . my wife doubts me buying smoker . now she bbq menu planned next week . all all i would recommend this friend . it easy use keeping heat consistent throughout smoking very easy propane controls vent	1
only complaint i my gas smoker it damaged when delivered ( this also case friend mine who ordered same smoker)it dented several places . i cooked many 12 whole chickens time they all came out fully cooked juicey . it great way cook . just put your meat , adjust your heat then set back visit your guest while smoker all work . after people tasted my smoked faire they always ask where i got my smoker . several my friends bought this smoker their own use	1
i bought great outdoors deluxe gas smoker my first smoker first time i used it , i cooked two pork boston butt . i never used smoker before i worried heat fluxuating , ( i think thats how you spell it ) , alot . once i got heat set(in 20 minutes ) i put two pork butt left it till next morning . i woke up checked temp it perfect . everyone who some my smoked pork thought i proffesional smoking my great outdoors deluxe gas smoker . i am doing some beef brisket this weekend see how it turns out . alot people saying thier smoker bad shape because packing manufacturer but smoker i bought lowe packed cardboard box foam supporting everything nothing damaged or scratched my smoker . i would recommend this smoker anyone wants very good easy use smoker . oh yeah ' it also easy clean !	1
hammock great choice if you like sharing it you significant other or yourself . it very sturdy comfortable , even two adults . quality hammock good worth price , especially compared other models we looked	1
this very neat hammock . it very comfortable easy get out . it course not allow air flow through like rope hammock , but so much more comfortable . i also bought matching pillow really enjoy lazy summer evenings now . i roll mine up bring it inside when i'm not using it , which quick easy make it last much longer . it hold adults , but little crowded	1
this awesome set !! my husband i use it all time . it looks great really take beating	1
i got my first weber ( genesis ) get smoker try ' er out . kinda wishing i saved my money just got smokey mt though ... here why : i got my grill home depot so i would nice cast iron porcelin enamel coated grates . when using smoker you must remove one grate replace it supplemental smaller grate so smoker fit side . this grate not sear like cast iron !!! weber also not make cast iron fit this size , so when using smoker , you only get 1/2 grill make nice sears . however , i havn't taken it out since i bought it over week ago , so i guess flavor worth it . ;-) regards previous review , i no trouble smoking pork sholder 5 hours , smoke thick rolling whole time . i think key soak chips minimum 30 minutes ( i'll let them soak hours if i think ahead ) . make sure you load up enough chips - i pretty much filled tray up . shut lid smoker !!! part key ! especially when heating up grill . when heating high i've found it takes slightly under 10 minutes start smolder , turn down grill now ! before it starts full smoke !! i wasn't going " low slow " ... but wanted maintain 325 degree oven entire time . i checked internal temp 3 , 4 , 5 hours getting pork up internal temp 182 ( figured it would rise couple degrees after i took it off ) . pulled pork amazing ! plus i got pink ring !!! it my first smoking experience i fed 10 people recipe weber nation ( i doubled it ) . so long story short ... if you already gas grill don't want invest $300+ smoker ... try it out ! it may not great smokey mt . but it really smokes	1
i bought this pillow because i just got new hammock my backyard i felt it needed one . what else i say hammock pillow ? soft , smooth fabric , prefect those weekend afternoon quot ; cat napsquot	1

"	1
i recently moved into house , seeing spiders centipedes regular basis , so i decided buy these see if i could get rid them . i've using these 3 weeks various rooms house , haven't seen bug since . i say they really seem doing what they're supposed . i used similar products like this past ( not black decker ) , also found them work , so i believe this technology actually works well getting rid pests	1

i wanted mainly write this address shipping complaints below . we redoing our deck expanding it , after research thought this would best buy durable product . after reading shipping complaints , we put it order right away- expecting it several weeks it would take deck . lo behold- 3 days later they call my wife ask deliver it- any 4 hour window she wants- she picks next morning next day when i get home there 4 giant boxes my garage spot when i get home . they huge boxes , double boxed , but luckily no styrofoam- still i take all cardboard recycling center myself , but least very little not recycleable . our deck still not , so i make little comment other than one i set up living room seems study- cushion very thick well made- but stiff- which may comment noted below ( i assume he goes very soft ) . i find it comfortable , but may comment more when we actually used them bit . still given shipping concerns noted several comments , i wanted point out if you someone who home four hour window- it seems no problem .	1

when i decided purchase weber kettle , i knew side table required . several reviews spoken table splitting . i ordered mine my local hardware store when i picked it up , i asked finishing it . hardware folks ( this really good store ) gave me gloss polyurethane finish very fine sandpaper prep my work table . bottom line : take some time finish this product . your local hardware folks guide you satisfactorily .	1

after reading these other reviews , i decided wait while post review . i bought two these chairs summer 04 they doing great . relatively easy put together really sturdy . they still looking good no issues fading or anything . my wife would make me get rid these if there any issue or problem them all . i hope she doesn't read this	1
i've these chairs week ( i bought two ) they look fabulous my front porch . they comfortable too . my expectations exceeded . like reviewer , i too searched adirondack chairs andfound prices ridiculously high . this chair ottomanfor $84.99 ($10 shipping ) steal !! quality construction seem far outweigh price . i only gave 4 stars because i can't comment durability maintenance after only week . strathwood recommends teak oil couple times year . i also purchased 30 " folding table place chairs - what set !!! if you're thinking this chair , don't hesitate , you not disappointed !	1

after extensive research despite less-than-exptected consumer reports ratings , i chose purchase 2007 weber summit s-450 grill . i own 5-year-old charbroil bowing out losing heat/smoke when i cook so i wanted multi-fuctional grill replace it would last longer . summit s-450 includes beautiful smoker box dedicated burner rotisserie kit . more importantly , it weber , which means great warranty customer service built last . when i opened item my friends we all salivated heavy-duty construction this grill . impressive stainless steel high-grade grill very heavy . no wobbling . it very easy set up took one hour . let me say although i expected this grill better than my old , i never thought it would so impressive all aspects . weber thinks everything when they make grill . heavy gauge stainless steel grates high-end burners this grill really catches your eye . researched grills all local hardware big box stores , i honestly say this grill beat them all just looks materials alone . even before i attached propane lit thing ! when i test burners i extremely impressed ignition system . i've never seen anything like it all burners , including rotisserie side lit first try . grill got up heat very quickly eveness heat evident buy looks using hand test over grates . while i only cooked hamburger my first meal , i pleasantly surprised beautiful grill marks grates left . i lot slow-cooking smoking thermometer , smoker box , seal grill certainly improve my grilling carolina pulled pork briskett . further , knobs/temperature controls seem offer infinite heating options . i cannot wait experiment learn this grill i add items my menu . while i just got this grill yesterday , i am more than hopeful quality craftmanship truly believe it last triple amount my charbroil . i'll add this review i continue use this wonderful grill	1
we stuck this outside our bedroom window - now we see what temperature outside soon we get up morning . no more waiting weather come news figure out what wear !	1
great cover , heavy well made . fit perfect . it didn't come any bourbon or beer though . i dissappointed	1
finally - grill cover actually stays grill protects it worst weather . velcro straps keep it secure but it very easy remove when ready use grill . this 4th or 5th grill cover we've tried it last one we try . i would recommend this product anyone investing iin grill . why not spend couple bucks more so your $400 grill doesn't rust out two seasons	1
man what awesome weber item .. it cooked chicken so well clean up charm . i think im planning buy cook two birds once .	1
very easy use . simply fill aluminum cup tray beer , wine , fruit juice , or some other beverage . extra flavor , add spice well . place infusion cone top cup , then place chicken top infusion cone . once chicken place , put infusion cap top lock steam . steam cooks chicken inside , heat outside . chicken tender juicy inside while skin cooked golden , crispy brown . fat grease drain away chicken collect bottom roaster instead grill . remove cooked chicken roaster : remove infusion cap . next , take pair tongs go down back side chicken slide it off infusion cone . this easy since roaster nonstick . if your chicken heavy , you may need support it second set tongs	1
using this procuct makes changing propane tanks really quick procedure . just remember pull outer ring back before installing male part . additional items need offered if you not just ordering extra one your weber grill . 1 ) adapter propane retailer fill your tank . 2 ) male portion this quick connect adapter so other propane appliances attached your tank . it doesn't look like it included offered . quick connect adapter itself won't you any good	1
excellent product , fits my grill perfectly , easy put take off . looks like winner ! one small sewing flaw but otherwise well mad	1

you can't go wrong here , took just 20 minutes i 10 thumbs , all you need hammer look pictures come book . taste , you can't tell even i , who burn water , cook mouth watering burgers steaks my family duplicates their high priced , propane lugging grills . same recipe-charcoal light it without propane burn . one just need very generous non-stick spray or else your food sticks breaks up grill . also kingford fast start charcoal marvel , if you cook just several burgers steak , because after 20 minutes charcoal burns out . lastly , bottom vent quite cheesy , so grilling i not open it grilled top off , no fear hot ashes whipping around yard	1
i easily read display 7-8 feet away dim light . base unit receives its signal remote i placed north side house shaded porch . 4 walls since two units located diagonally across my house . absolutely no problems reception . i purchased additional remote ( thr138 ) . when i place base two remotes side side room temperature let them stabilize 15 minutes , all three agree within 0.3 degrees farenheit . read manual ! add batteries remote(s ) first , press reset button(s ) something non-conductive ( toothpick ) , then add batteries base unit . i live cold climate . while i haven't experienced sub-zero temps since purchasing this unit , my other oregon scientific wireless thermometer , rar232 , worked just fine alkaline batteries -16f this season . excellent value	1
i put sensor out my backdoor shady area 30 feet main unit kitchen . one screw attaches each item . it three channels . it'll memorize high low indoor outdoor temperature . display large enough read several feet away . it installed several months silent , dependable , accurate temperature monitoring .	1
my husband i talking getting detector off over year . more we looked into it , more confused we . we didn't know what features we needed or what look . we didn't want spend too much but afraid go too low end up one didn't work well . we decided this one based other reviews price . it came video which helped us understand model how they work general . just practicing around yard he found two colonial coins . we've only taken it one camping trip found silver dime , some quarters , pennies , silver mexican peso new hampshire 4 inches deep . my husband getting hang it . more items you find , more you understand it . he says when it says it junk , turns out it junk it right quarters smaller coins . we very happy unit feel we made right choice . i would given it one more star but my husband hasn't found any jewelry yet	1

we not only use this roasts . we cradle chicken , turkey , pork rolls cooking also . we pleased so far . nickel-plated steel rack cleans easily too	1
i really hoping larger grill but i should read measurements ! after reading directions , you put foil drip pan bottom surround this your coals ... then if you cooking something needs longer cooking time , you keep adding coals .. i don't get how you would this if you grill full hot food .. seems little inconvenient me . it okay few burgers dogs but i think i'll invest larger grill next time	1
works great . i wanted projection clock quite some time . this one works wonderfully cost wonderful also . i still not installed outside sensor i'm trying find " perfect " location . you can't go wrong this one	1
only outdoor bbq thermometer i could find lighted digital readout . easy see dim light outside bbq . reliable -accurate -and easy use -at affordable pric	1

i saw review this grill regarding cover already ... i just wanted reiterate cover listed this grill incorrect . cover numbered ' 9911 ' not cover one touch performer . you need order cover numbered ' 9986 ' get proper cover this grill . i confirmed this weber . if you ever issues your grill ... not hesitated call or email weber ... their customer svc . out this world . otherwise , this fantastic grill . i grew up eating off webers i own old school 18 " kettle i long i remember .... weber smokey mountain cooker ( must ) now this performer . although given me gift , worth every penny .	1
i bought performer amazon 9 months ago now never got around reviewing it . yesterday , i cooking some pork chops it , i made mental note come here review . personally , i believe it best charcoal grill most people . like others said , it so easy get charcoal started without using lighter * gag * fluid . yes , you could use chimney accomplish this same time i used chimney years . but small child , dog , dry conditions here dallas , performer solution so much safer . performer cooks well any weber kettle which fantastic . work area nice holder charcoal very clever . i really can't imagine better charcoal grill non fanatic . i missing part my grill when i received it . however , one call weber part me days . it wheel so it wasn't big deal -- i could assemble everything else . final disclosure -- i am pretty big fan weber products . when i bought this i three other weber grills . i found performer replaced both old standard kettle my genesis gas grill . performer ready so quick i just never used gas grill any more . gave it friend no regrets .	1

i love my brinkman smoker . but i some modifications get it its present state : offset firebox arrangement : using plain old charcoal cost you fortune ! when i first got this christmas present , i found this out quick ! i went thru whole 20 pound bag kingsford . too costly ! so what i buy propane tank propane burner . i ran burner metal intake connector out brinkman air intake vent . perfect fit ! vent also held up one end propane burner . then i placed regular brick inside firebox support other side propane burner . i now all heat i want , cheaply also i now pretty good temperature control ! i also agree poster optional temperature gauge placed brinkman cutout waste money would inaccurate . i it regret buying thing . however get remote smoker temperature unit gives you two separate temperature probes readings . this way you monitor both meat internal smoker temps without opening huge smoking chamber lid which would waste all your heat smoke ! speaking smoke ...... it drove me crazy figuring out how make sustained source smoke wouldn't snuff out propane burner process ! here what i solve this new problem : take off " hobbit " external smoke stack . then take off flimsy end cap holds swivel lid exhaust vent . drill , carefully make 1/8 inch hole thru welded rod end cap attached . replace lid . now , take tie-wire or maybe cotter pin put into hole you just made so swivel lid won't fall off you invert it ....... invert it ??? yes , invert it . see , you stuffing hickory wood blocks into this inverted pipe . part swivel lid placed directly onto propane burner . end smoke stack should positioned into smoking chamber . this way smoke produced , smoke go directly into chamber not fire box which if it would snuff out propane burner ! speaking hickory smoke ...... don't buy chips ! it too costly ! buy instead hickory wood blocks . i buy mines home depot large bags super cheap ! i use my small axe carefully size hickory blocks so it fits snuggly into inverted smoke stack . works like magic . oh , one more thing ...... place hickory wood block you carefully sized into now stubby smoking chamber exhaust pipe , where smoke stack used attach . wood block block just enough so most smoke stays inside chamber wood block allow just enough air flow so offset firebox propane burner get its air . there you it . perfect smoker cheap operate effective generating smoke ! don't forget place metal pot ontop propane burner full water . you need this boiling create needed steam your smoker performance	1
i this smoker 8 years . i live east coast florida , it subjected great many adverse conditions . sun , rain , heat , salt air occasional 150+ mph sandblasting . only degradation it experienced 2 legs ( without wheels ) need replacing due rusting off bottom , grills replaced . maintenance snap , just regular cleaning occasional coat oven black . she may not youngest lady ball , but she still makes best ribs , chicken steak	1
what great piece equipment . elegant its simplicity , seems very sturdy ... easy assemble , if you organize first ! offers many cooking options , well made , great price ... wonderful brisket , can't wait till thanksgiving .. smoked turkey , yum ! it covered yard but use year round	1
i bought this grill locally after researching many others . i originally not want side burner , but very happy it . it works great cooking vegetables pan superb griddle cooking breakfast . i cook entire dinner or breakfast without using stove . i agree it take long time assemble ( 2 hrs . ) but solid works beautifully . i would highly recommend this grill money it great deal	1
we live water .... front back ! we not go outside day or night without these zappers . we fog , put out larve killing donuts any standing water puddles spring . we hang two stinger bug zappers . each night there pile dead mosquitos under each one . every three days we blow screens clean air compressor . i go three doors away eaten alive neighbors mosquitos . we bought expensive mosquito deleto- $400.00 what waste money ! it caught 6 mosquitos stingers mound ! we bug zappers long they out can't live without them ! we feel safe west nile virus our yard . can't say enough good things these lights .	1
hammock fine , particularly great price unfortunately , my pine trees dripped sap onto hammock , which pain get off . not hammock fault - i guess it just wasn't such good idea	1
ws-9119u weather station monitors outside temp humidity inside temp humidity . further it monitors barometric pressure , make gross prediction weather change via pictoral representations weather . price , it serves function , but it not all encompasing scientific weather station ..... most which cost hundreds , if not thousands dollars . this unit good observe outside weather conditions , monitor inside conditions , monitor gross weather change .... this it reliable relatively inexpensive instrument	1
some reviews this weather station looked pretty poor , but i took chance bought it anyway . overall i am very pleased glad i didn't take reviews too seriously . i found temperature accuracy seems fine ; i put base unit , external sensor , second extra sensor , my old radio shack digital thermometer all same location , within half hour they all within 1 degree each other , indicating me temperature sensors consistently acccurate . i also no problem lcd viewing angle ; it adjustable seems wide viewing angle anyway so i haven't seen any need adjust it . one my few complaints all external temperature sensors shown display " outside " temperature , where reality i would think it more likely most users place one sensor outside , any extra sensors beyond would indoors ( i could wrong here ) . first i concerned forecasting function would ' confused ' seeing several outside temperature/humidity readings vary greatly , but eventually i found one sentence manual indicates only first external sensor used weather forecasting . so it little confusing but works fine long you make sure external sensor #1 truly outside temperature . heads-up base unit larger than i imagined , it looks pretty chunky sitting my bathroom vanity . so sure read dimensions	1
i really like these clocks . our school constantly problems clocks all classrooms different this really helped situation . digital ones better but la crosse ones , which least expensive , also happen best analog clocks we've tried	1
this cushion extra long extra thick - should work most any chaise lounge . it really firm support . not one those puffy things go flat one season . i highly recommend it .	1
i purchased my oregon scientific station 8 years ago . internal sensor batteries need changed annually , i've changed rechargeables outside once ... i live georgia we get lots sun . other than needing reset unit every 6 months ( gets confused near lightning strikes , but then what wireless electronics don't ? ) perhaps not high precision rain gauge i'd like , it more than adequate any home weather enthusiast	1
well sometimes it pays take chance . after reading negative review these tongs i went ahead bought them anyway ... i love steven raichlen show his books . well , either i disagreement earlier review or they fixed ' em . these tongs work great , very heavy duty handling big slabs meat like i like cook , extra length keeps my hands cool without gloves . i vote 5 stars . keep bbq'ing	1
i just my platinum grill stolen i'm not only devestated , but hard time finding one available . just found one ace . this perfect grill anything . let rally weber make this more available !	1
if you like big weber grills but need small one tailgating , this great choice . i no problem putting 3 , 4 , or even 5 steaks this grill no problem . it tight well buil t.t he only thing i don't like kind cheap side went covers . they come flat so they don't conform shape grill . you kind form them bending them around your knee or something then they fit fine . i give this grill 9 out 10 brats . edit , one year later : they made big mistake moving vent holes traditional place bottom kettle sides . it completely changes air flow result consistently cold fire . my three minutes per side burgers normal webber more like five or six minutes per side this little grill . bottom line this grill ok tailgating camping , but i don't use it nearly much i thought i would if i just one grill , i'd get one other webbers vents bottom . this grill disappointment me	1
this our second weber grill past 10 years . fact new grill essentially exact same grill one we purchased ' 90s ... same size features . we actually use natural gas rather than propane ( i goofed order ) , but we able quickly transplant conversion kit old grill new one . we've used it few times it works perfectly . quickly heats up grills evenly . looking forward many years great meals off this grill	1

this third three these clocks i purchased our city council chambers . first i somewhat leery location our chambers would make it difficult clocks automatically set themselves via radio setting , but this turned out unwarranted . result we three clocks now automatically keep perfect time , all synchronized , all automatically adjusting daylight savings time standard time . past , keeping three clocks one room synchronized impossible , made more difficult since these 15 feet up wall . features temperature humidity added bonus . price 25% much compared other clocks our city investigating . all , i am totally impressed these clocks , their operation , their pricing , so much so , i bought two my home one my travel trailer	1

after receiving my la crosse atomic clock , i followed 4 simple steps back box left it hanging my wall overnight near window west side my house . basically , set it up all you install aa battery press button back clock set your time zone ( et , ct , mt , or pt ) , clock rest overnight . reception signal appearently clearest during night , according instruction manual . anyway , next morning after hanging it my wall clock perfect synchronization time shown my directv satellite tv . i live greater seattle area no trouble receiving atomic timekeeping radio signal ft . collins , co . i'd rate this clock 5 star buy . only slight downside construction inexpensive plastic ( not metal ) , but then clock would probably cost lot more if it metal . note : manual warns this may not work interior building . also , clock probably won't receive signal if you're inside metal-framed building ( such office tower ) . wooden buildings lots windows work best , especially if you're far colorado	1
i am impressed this product . all parts clearly marked . all parts included box . directions excellent . no complaints here	1

i am no pro grilling , but this grill makes it all so easy ! it easy put together , easy use , easy clean up . everything i toss it turns perfectly grilled absolutely yummy ! there cheaper charcoal grills out there , but if you're petite woman , like me , who doesn't grill living , it well worth extra money little conveniences this grill . i got 18 1/2 inch grill , it plenty room preparing dinner 4-6 adults . since putting my grill together , i cooked out every weekend	1
i owned brinkman smoker 14 years ... not this one , but more simple model costs $85.00 . i smoked several turkeys , many chickens , salmon , pork roasts .... all great success . two things i think might help your low temperature problem : 1 . you use extension cord it ? i once same problem you when i used long extension cord . troubleshooting , i searched manual came it found it says not use long extension cords ( you'll search your manual maximum optimum length ) . please don't give up your smoker ! i get much more tender , juicy results than i my flambeed grilled meats !! ha ha ! smoker easy use , no fuss not too bad mess clean if you line your water pan heavy duty foil ! i use easy-off oven cleaner my two racks water pan sure rinse them very well . i leave four hours my food ready when i return ( just sure your water pan always liquid it ) when we company , they love smoked flavor . hope this helps . once i eliminated long extension cord , all well . 2 . you peeking your turkey or basting it ? my lid also small gap through which smoke escapes , but it doesn't affect it . you cannot constantly open lid peek or baste this allows heat escape it take while smoker reach proper temperature again . no need baste smoker ! meat always juicy . i found your review because after 14 years , i'm seeing rust my smoker , which one best our wedding gifts . i never owned cover it but always stored it garage when not use . this last year , however , it spent much time neglected outside ( i four children now ) i wanted research smokers find replacement our trusty old one ! i would highly recommend brinkman electric smoker anyone who considering purchasing one ( sorry , i've never tried brand ) . it so much easier than grilling because you never need watch over your food prevent charring . i guess you could say smoker grill crockpot oven , except unlike crockpot food , meat appear beautifully golden-browned no blackness .	1
this great product own . we really enjoy able know current outisde temp anytime we would like , especially here nebraska where we so many extremes , summer winter . inside thermometer perfectly accurate ( compared our themostat ) , outside temperature accurate within couple degrees ( compared internet weather sites ) , although i think variances sun changes , etc . not necessarily defect product . trickiest thing owning this weather station figuring out where locate outside sensor , it out direct sunlight moisture , but still within range internal display . it great gift we really enjoyed owning it	1

i love sunflower seeds , chocolate , cherries , so you imagine my delight when i found these chocolate cherry sunflower seeds available amazon . when packet arrived , i tore it open downed entire contents into my eager mouth , expecting explosion chocolate-cherry-sunflowery sapidity . instead , i got mouthful hard shells . i crunched through tough , outer hulls , wondering inventiveness manufacturers who somehow injected chocolate cherry flavors into hard , unopened shells , but then i macerated both hull softer kernel into splintery mash , found chocolate cherry flavors somehow gone missing . when my wife came home , i mentioned her how i ripped off chocolate cherry sunflower seeds which lacked both chocolate cherry flavors , fact , barely edible . my wife picked up empty packet , looked it moment , then hit me over head dining room chair . " you idiot , " she said , " these seeds planting . " she then clobbered me antique , oak coat tree . " i don't know why i ever married you , " she continued , " you always doing stupid , embarrassing things , no matter how hard i hit you , you never learn . " she then whacked me coffee table emphasis . maybe i gotten bad batch seeds . i think i order them again , next time , manufacturers better not forget chocolate cherry flavors , or someone going get beating	1

shopped long time this one . wanted more pit than copper bowls offer . plus came grill , cover handy fire tool . nice deal , easy assemble	1
i bought this table four chairs also made strathwood . i it my patio where i see flame our hot tub it looks gorgeous burning dusk . i number people comment way it looks i unable find better value . it looks like it lot heavier than it , it remarkably easy move piece cake assemble even myself . drawbacks black mesh screen needs stored somewhere else ( there no hidden nooks where you stick it easy access when you decide light fire ) it sits lower than your average table , so if you need sit use table work or read , it isn't going work you . it fine eating casually , though . there little screws bottom legs so you level table without using other hardware if you uneven surface like i , you move it around adjust it easily stop any wobbling . other issue i chairs made same company don't fully fit under table , armrests little too high , so they won't push all way under table .	1
short extra limb hinged grate allows roasting/grilling much less heat loss . extra control heat source allows better cooked product . " this steak -- tching " , quote gameday crowd jack kent cook stadium fedex field maryland . i continue " pimp my grill " more accessories next season	1

can't say too much replacement ignitor system but it works . it installed easily expected , appeared slightly better quality than part it replaced . if previous part any indication , it should last 5-7 years , hard believe this time designed obsolesence	1
i just rebuilt genesis i . it didnt need igniter it lit first clickevery time anyway . but changed it it 7 years old orso . also changed flavorizor bars they aboutworn away	1
i sent this my in-laws foy christmas they loved it !! they recently added backyard garden they thrilled it love how it looks . i am told it quite comfortable well	1
i thought bench very good buy money . it fits perfectly small area our deck	1
pump works well , certainly good expected excellent price ! it , however , leave least inch oil bottom pot . instructions say this last bit oil too dirty , it best discarded . reality , design pump just doesn't allow it suck oil up low level . i , however , able sufficiently filter most these last few cups oil using pump large-mouth jar . when poured into jar much smaller diameter , oil deep enough pump get it , leaving only small amount i didn't mind discarding	1
i hate admit , but we roaches ! actually , we roaches until last week when i purchased this product . i tried everything : sprays , bombs , traps , etc ... but nothing worked . first day i plugged this little device , there such great increase bug activity my kids wouldn't go into kitchen . day 3 , roaches gone ! i don't know where they went , i don't care . this device saved my sanity	1
this ideal instrument us . we like walk early morning - when temperature outside above 40 degrees ! projected time temperature tell us whether we need get out bed - or sleep little longer . weather forecasting feature also useful - least accurate tv forecasts	1
love large illuminated time/temp ceiling . setting up external temperature sensor bit tricky , you'll need make sure you glasses size screwdriver , which i didn't readily available . otherwise everything worked promised . i am still not positive if " atomic " sensor working . instructions said you something like 750 miles ( or it 1000 ) away location denver etc . i am detroit so signal never seemed sync up , but it may i am not sure . all all great purchase .	1
since i started using this unit i cooked my best thanksgiving turkey , my best christmas ham my best new year pork roast ever . only reason it not 5 star i've needed booklet almost every time i've used it . controls aren't difficult , but they aren't really intuitive either . i'd go 4-1/2 stars if i option	1
unfortunately , i wanted spatula wok use house , not outside . therefore , i just recently returned it . but it great !	1
wow ! this burner really rocks . it sounds like jet engine when you crank it up high . it really kicks out heat . i it 2 days now , used it both nights dinner . brought very large pot corn boil no time . but still control steam crab legs without boiling water dry . very impressed range flame control . grid reverses bowl shape woks , flat side pots pans . really nice . i could not happier	1
very , very happy this appliance . i bit sceptical before ordering when i read `stamped metal ' but when it arrived , yes it stamped metal ( not every component , though ) , but very heavy gauge metal very well engineered . i used it immediately after i received it wow ! talk `dragon`s breath!' very high btu food cooked like i never experienced . finally , authentic oriental cooking home . highly recommended . update : well , i've using this quite long time now i am even more pleased than ever . i remember asking chinese chef china town how come i can't make food like this home . he stated ( heavy oriental dialect ) , " you gotta use hot wok . wok gotta very , very hot ! " yep , that secret . you never replicate authentic oriental cooking ordinary gas or electric stove . " you gotta use hot wok !! " this devise puts out btus very " hot wok " indeed	1

this little weather station works well pretty simple set up . you read instructions get remote sensor sync , but otherwise easy . i found this one better looking units os . it medium size numbers easy read . reading barometric pressure outdoor temp humidity , it pretty good job predicting weather . order get outside temp there remote sensor . effective you need mount it shady area screw . also instructions suggest more expensive lithium batteries ( not included ) remote sensor because alkaline batteries only measure temps down just below freezing , then batteries freeze . lithium batteries allow temp readings all way down chilly -22 . my only disappointment this unit main display not wall mountable , only desk stand . also radio signal clock setting comes goes	1

this remote temperature sensor works conjunction base unit permits you monitor outdoor temp humidity well indoor temp , anywhere your house . i keep base unit my bedroom then tell both outdoor temp lower level indoor temps when getting dressed day . i think system works very well reasonable cost	1
besides outdoor temperature relative humidity , i use base station inside three remote wireless monitors measure temperature humidty my crawlspace , attic outdoors monitor possible water intrusion issues if there freezing temperature concerns pipes during cold weather periods	1
i lot research if you follow directions , it safe fun . it takes 25 min heat oil 45 minutes cook 11 lb . turkey . pot maximum oil level mark correct amount our bird . turkey must dried well prevent spattering . watch oil temp . so it not go over 350 . it outdoors paint burn off burners it smells .	1

amazing little grill . 8 charcoal briquettes , i cooked couple salmon-burgers it lunch , then put two cornish game hens , put cover , let them bake hour , them later dinner . note : don't peak under lid when using this grill oven . heat escapes it takes awhile build it back up . instead , use your nose ears . excellent little grill camping , picnics , emergencies . since it uses so little fuel , you great deal cooking single bag charcoal . don't use lighter fluid , use small " starter stick " start coals .	1
i purchased lentek bite shield because it only product i able find , works same principle european mosquito repellents i am used . i needed it my daughter bedroom so i couldn't use any type candles safety reasons i didn't want use anything rubbs directly skin since she extremely sensitive skin . lentek bite shild seems work pretty well , she got bitten only once - night i forgot turn it . now i plan buy adapter plug it outlet . way i would sure batteries wouldn't die middle night .	1

i bought this feeder week ago after spotting hummingbird my backyard . it looks great yard i love detail hanger . ( it nothing fancy , but it sweet . ) i used clear hummingbird formula hung it area didn't get lot people traffic , but clear view . then i waited ... three days there nothing ... then finally last night while sitting outside , my husband i saw 3 different hummingbirds sipping feeder !! i so excited i immediately informed him ( his own distress ) our yard would filled feeders before long . :) i think it great buy hummingbirds really seem like it . i may consider one perch , but i must say it truly exciting watching them hover , then dart away . enjoy	1
i just put mine together it warns you mustn't keep gas connected each time you reattach gas you soap test . i guess i keep screwing propane tank off , but that such pain soapy water messy ! first roast turned out well , but winter , california , 60 degree weather it took little longer than expected ( 2.5 lbs beef it edible/medium 160 degrees internal 3.5 hours two rather large handfuls apple chips soaked 24 hrs ) . flame blew out three times scared me because i wasn't watching it whole time , when i thought propane exploding upwards ! i didn't think it would go out so easily , so i just ended up feeding it more gas tried cut intensity heat using air intake adjustment . you add more chips get lot smoke flavor so easy , but you lift whole body up off including water pot meat , which could get heavy , but least you keep lid keep some heat there . good thing this design if you doing charcoal , you replace charcoal quickly . overall , i'm very excited , but i those couple gripes ... no door access water pan no way access coals without lifting whole top off no easy way remove propane safety . i love ease gas option you patience saint tend my other charcoal smoker it didn't way get rid ash keep temperature even accessing coal bowl really pain , especially if you wanted add hot glowing charcoal . i'm pleased though ! i got this one my birthday gift myself since i always wanted gas grill instant gratification . i love charcoal briquettes chunks well , so i'm pleased i still option . read owners manual thouroughly before purchasing so you don't any surprises . you also need adjustable wrenches or specific sizes ( i used two crescent adjustable wrenches ) put it together , but it went together fairly intuitively quickly	1
bought this use my weber smokey mountain . i almost bought sunbeam rib rack half price local home improvement chain but it seemed lot flimsier . this rack solid built weber quality . one reason i can't give it 5 stars because sunbeam rack skewers potatoes i would really like see this rack . if ribs too big , i just wrap them around wrap quite easily	1
while we've used coleman folding stoves years , if you trunk space , there no reason earth limit yourself small stove when you grill this wonderful tabletop grill . small tank makes this practical camping . if you want real barbecue while tenting under stars , you camp where tailgate or picnic table available , this great choice camping equipment . we still like coleman boiling water , but i love barbecuing propane grill like this	1
i return my 1st order due mould wood ( around joins ) inside glass front . my replacement little mould inside glass front , but i decided i could live it .. i blame amazon storage this rather than manufacturing it lacrosse . glass front spherical , so tends get weird light reflections , so watch this when you hanging it . note when battery low , second hand move 2 second jumps let you know battery low - this feature , not problem , which i like . other than it works great ! ( i live close boulder nist , where radio signal comes , so also take this into account when ordering any radio controlled clocks ) .	1
pop battery forget it , it sets itself right dot even after daylight savings time came	1
we pleased our recent purchase . we surprised it came through us mail service . it broken part we believe used cord open umbrella .	1
works great my lacrosse weather station . make sure you check compatible models . i two external temperature sensors now ( one outside one my shed ) . only issue you must remove batteries all units , install them back external temp sensors then into main weather station it find both them correctly . this directions course . hope this helps	1
i don ? usually write things like this but mosquitoes magnet i wanted more protection without annoyance refilling carrying propane around not mention cost . every three weeks buy propane bad enough ! i took chance this galaxie product i am glad i its capturing everything yard . it appears works almost well magnet theirs no refilling propane ! if this keeps up i buy two more these units retire magnet . i give this product five stars !	1
bulb seems fine described .. i haven't installed it yet , no bugs yet ..	1
purchased sofa two chairs my backyard i say , they look great . clean lines , good proportions , beautiful chocolatey color . seat cushion bit firm , but probably good help it hold up . i say linen cover bit disappointing fabric bit more like sailcloth then i'd hoped ... but easily recovered , i certainly deal it meantime , especially given great price . only other thing seat quite deep i feel like could used some sort back cushion , but we bought some outdoor throw pillows trick . let hope these pieces hold up , if they , i'd say they great design value	1
although quite tasty very prolific i found greens somewhat " soft " , my husband who dislikes salad greens normally however liked texture . i only used three greens still eat salad every other day keep up growth	1

i've always felt it probably little unsanitary use aluminum beer inked labeling hot grill . maybe not , but it gives me pause . this device works more stable possibly more healthy alternative bud . it also perfect if you want use other liquids such wine , juice or whatever . only downside clean-up . it consists four parts , each which get coated chicken drippings need some serious scrubbing get off cooked-on residue . i've found dishwasher alone doesn't really remove all it . little scrubbing necessary really get device clean . this certainly useful item us backyard cooks . it little inconvenient compared using beer tossed trash after using	1
i skeptical after reading some reviews this looking price . once i got it lit it , unbelievable . i tendency read reviews pick up others issues products , so there little propane hissing , but heat it puts out unbelievable . flame levels alot higher when you think how much heat flames your grill puts out . handles/footrests heavy duty perfectly placed . saying all , i see only drawback amount fuel you might go through . it says it last 7 hrs , might little generous . i got rave reviews when i started it up , next day when we real fire pit going , everyone appreciated they didn't wash their clothes due smokey smell . best part . aagin , great product	1
other reviews correct . this unit works very well every way , basket mesh kind food holder would good option , use drip pan keep coals off sides , ring riser/extension useful smoking cooking big things , etc . it all good , but there more : who you know who actually charcoal grill rotisserie ? nobody . if you get one , your guests entertained several levels you master . rotisseries professional looking , produces unmatched taste exciting demonstration-style cooking experience everyone . those utilize them seen proficient competent . not bad label you , eh ? might get you somewhere . best meal i ever rotisserie turkey saved me starvation after hike death . perhaps it save you or loved one . rotisserie cooking lends itself acclaimed high heat , short cooking time technique . hot coals self-basting action work well here . one major gourmet magazines cooked turkeys every way known strongly recommended high heat way . this also suggested method cooking heritage meats wild game . starting out 500+ degrees ending something short us government temperature recommendations secret . turkey , example , best taken out heat around 170 , or less , allowed rest . it go up around 10 degrees after . i tie bacon strips onto breast add wet smoking wood chips coals . stuff cavity orange some garlic . other things could used , too . i rotisseried heritage , free range , organic , kosher regular good quality supermart turkeys this high-heat method they all good . governments institutions recommend heat guaranteed kill off any everything , prevent lawsuits course . however , fresh good quality meat not nuked point where you could make furniture out it . use separate thermometer , not supplied pop-out sensor . i am no professional , but i say it produces best tasting food .	1
very easy adapt my grill . looking forward its many us	1

i'm sorry but this thing worked my room . my breaking point when i found massive roach my bed , well , half it my bed rest my upper back ... i nasty spiders mice over-running place but ever since i installed it , i haven't seen any . i , however , see them other rooms , but not one mine	1
i haven't any problems this clock . it what it supposed , looks pretty good doing it . only reason i didn't give it five stars because i haven't it long ... maybe 3 or 4 weeks . so i'm not sure how it overall durability , but so far so good . dailight savings time coming up , one it first " real " tests . if you're thinking buying it i say go it	1
please remember unseasoned cast iron needs seasoned consumer before first use . it rust if not properly seasoned . season grill press , remove handle unscrewing two screws either end . rinse mild soap water , then thoroughly dry . rub cooking oil over entire surface clean rag or paper towel . place it oven preheated 250 degrees fahrenheit approximately 2 hours . handle care when removing , press quite hot . use hot pad . let grill press cool heat resistant surface , replace handle , then store usual . because cast iron porous , each time you use grill press following initial seasoning more oil seep through foods enforce waterproof oil bond . grill press should not left water not dishwasher safe . rinse press under hot water after each use dry immediately blotting water droplets towel . if directions properly followed , your steven raichlen cast iron grill press should last years .	1
not versatile one we bought over 20 years ago san antonio folk life festival , but every bit well made . original adjustable so you could stretch out better , but this one equally comfortable . this one actually better support bar	1
title says it all - no flimsy board table top , no rickety legs , just sound , reliable folding table	1
i just recieved this mail . setup 15 minutes , but frame metal thin . i am not saying it isn't good unit , but i am afraid it won't last long i intended . burn areas bigger than most i seen , but pan below appears some gaps allowing ambers fall grownd . again , i not used this yet - but expecting it bit tougher frame . i would not pay more than $150 this - hd , lowes other locations provide bit more money what i believe could longer lasting units . overall i am glad i purchased this but learned quality cannont confirmed via picture or desciption . best luck happy burning	1
chair set looks great pretty much put together . instructions ok but could use some more close ups . so here trick i found wasn't mentioned . it best ( only way i could get things connected all ) put " cap " ( like fancy nut flange ) slot first then feed bolt into it . bit information would helped lot . i " " put lots things similar this together so not complete novice . other - bit more major problem - one leg chair appears denser wood or pilot holes not drilled correctly . so no matter what i one side i could not get final screws ( there only four other connectors bolts end caps ) all way came close permanently stipping hex bolts . answer drill longer pilot holes but i need someone drill so it down line . i also agree it not very comfortable without thick cushion like type goes lots outdoor furniture . so good product better than some " put it together yourself " but not perfect . it seems very sturdy but reviewer stated it too soon tell longevity product	1

this may called roast holder but you've missed out until you used one cook turkey . you cook up 14 lb . turkey easily 22-1/2 inch grill using this rack . i cooked my first turkey weber 21 years ago cooked least two every year since . there no comparison if you want moist tasty turkey . my family would mutiny if i tried cook turkey any other way my wife loves her oven available fix rest holiday dinner . maybe one day i'll try cook roast but i wouldn't trade this rack any other way cook turkey	1
it very durable grill should last years , if not decades . this size , it strictly grill -- you won't offset-cook this . note : weber grills made used lid , always . if you cook without lid , you lose temperature control , fire often gets too hot you get old burned-on-the-outside-raw-on-the-inside syndrome . lid vents use , webers best charcoal grills temperature control my experience ... although smaller grill , harder it . i think weber still makes slightly larger version smokey joe -- one 18.5 -inch grill . give you lot more flexibility while still very portable . it possible offset-cook chicken two 18.5 -inch grill but probably not this one . finally , this not use your apartment balcony . that illegal most places most assuredly dangerous . even if you concrete balcony , sparks waft away your grill set something else fire	1
this most amazing piece equipment barbequing . everyone should own one . i purchased one my daughter she delighted it . i plan ordering extra one just spare	1
this good addition patio space when umbrella stand needed , design color base blend most newer outdoor furniture . base sturdy solid comes five rubber feet screwed into base added stability leveling uneven surfaces . diameter base stalk holds most patio umbrellas , but sure measure diameter yours first before ordering this size ( 1 3/4 " diameter ) instead larger size available elsewhere . contrary original description this item , however , weight not 70 pounds . it closer 61 pounds without stalk 63 pounds it . ( ups recorded weight 67 pounds , not 73 pounds claimed description . package dimensions also smaller 25 " 25 " 4 " . ) also , diameter not 28 " but 22 " - 23 " , so aware well . description here amazon more accurate , i would rated item higher ..	1

i looking grilles over year now , i retire my trusty quickset . all features , size quality , this one cant beat . assembly very extensive , but if you ever put anything together more complicated then pizza box , you put this together . packaging wasnt best , but mine really good shape , so i cant complain much . it looks better , larger cooking area , heats more evenly , heats more quickly , easier clean then my fathers $1400 grille , mine griddle his lacks . if you looking solid all around performer then this grille you . if you dont know how use screwdriver , dont patience assemble anything , then either pay someone it , or chose some thing alittle more basic , like quickset model	1

i bought this grill replace dying charmglow model several years old . it several features my wife i insisted upon our next grill , namely stainless steel grates , 3 burners , stainless steel finish . all all , it marvelously cooking everything we've tried steaks , chicken fish , full 30 lb . turkey . bird came out perfect ! three controls easy use , lower storage compartment roomy , all parts made quality mind . my only complaint arrangement burners , which top bottom ( or , front back , if you prefer ) you face grill . side side arrangement would make indirect cooking much easier rectangular-shaped grill area , where you could one burner off two , still plenty room whatever cooking . assembling it bit chore , took me two my buddies hour half . one note caution : read instuctions carefully pay close attention illustrations !! we didn't , didn't realize our assembly error until we third way though job . no biggie , but this second grill i've put together , they don't get easier . bottom line : weber makes best gas grill this type this price range . i expect it last 10 years care , am very glad i bought it	1
