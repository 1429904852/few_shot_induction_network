after reading number positive reviews product , i wanted try it . i am glad i just went my local whole foods supermarket , instead paying excessive ship/g costs when ordering online . basically , i not like it ... don't like taste or texture ; i am not really bothered smell once it rinsed . i eat tofu products regularly i also eat pasta occasionally would rather eat my whole wheat pasta 1-2x/mth than eat this tofu-noodle regularly . however , everyone different tastes . so if you want try it , get it your local grocer ( if they carry it ) , otherwise don't waste your money ship/g	-1
i absolutely would recommend avoiding this item . it vile aftertaste - even if you stomach artificial sweetener , this product flavor so blatantly unnatural . if you get past sweetener frightening list ingredients , texture isn't particularly appealing , what tiny granules floating throughout . i know this dessert sounds too good true , it	-1
this small package noodles came me huge box , which i thought huge waste completely unnessecary . , when i opened box , small melted ice pack failed keep noodles cold , so they hot smelled terrible . i throw them trash outside right away because smell , called gristedes left upset , yet polite message . it almost week i not heard them . don't waste your money this supposedly " great deal . " it not worth it	-1
this most disgusting diet product i've tried . i love marshmallow dip , this wasn't even close tasting like it . it chemical taste , like you're eating spun plastic , makes you actually scared eat it . why even bother eating it . i'll stick fat free whipped topping -- least it flavor	-1

i search find great oolong tea . this set contained one somewhat weak black tea , two green teas , very strong jasmine . i much prefer black teas so tried one cup each then gave these away . perhaps if you more exotic tea taste , this would better choice you than it me . so far , very inexpensive bigelow oolong come closest true oolong black cup tea .	-1
24 teabags isn't even enough one pot . perhaps my tastes run contrary mainstream , but i like my tea very strong .	-1
good black tea not hard find - just hard find your grocery store . honest truth tazo really not make many , if any really good teas . this , particular , one their worst . it bitter leaves bad taste your mouth immediately . every time i get stuck starbucks friends i am faced choice - tea , chai or steamed milk . every time i cave give tazo chance it disappoints me . if you want good black tea look local tea shop let them brew you few cups . try keemun , lapsang maybe golden dianhong see how it goes . if you really want kick it up notch look cameroonian black . take it someone who really loves tea , this stuff not worth your time . when you get good tea , please don't brew it your coffee maker	-1
i think coffee taste more personal preference , but i not fond this decaf coffee . i always drink my coffee black i didn't get rich coffee taste i like don francisco brand . illy great reputation so i am guessing their non-decaf coffee outstanding , they just need little work decaf	-1

this carafe initially perfect . design attractive simple , it fits well my bag mornings . problem then began keeping liquids boiling hot would cause it explode after jostled my morning commute . i attempted remedy this cooling my morning coffee or tea morning , although i felt this partially defeating purpose bringing my own coffee or tea . then it became issue liquid would either leak or shoot out carafe after turned slightest direction other than straight up . i'd suggest saving yourself trouble tea stained clothes buying different carafe altogether	-1

i really like my senseo coffee maker . i , like others who reviewed kona pods here , always searching better tasting coffee pod use machine . i excited see kona now made pods also happy see they pod ' 2 cup style ' . i not found it huge deal use 2 smaller ' 1 cup ' size pods , but it sounded nice able just put one large pod machine instead 2 smaller one . after reading some reviews here , i could not figure out what some reviewers meant kona pods making different amount coffee per cup each time or how coffee could strange undrinkable . it just didn't make sense . well , it still doesn't make sense , but it certainly happened coffee i made using kona pods also . my results overall poor it very disappointing kona pods cost lot more than folgers or other pod brands i buy locally . first thing i noticed coffee 2 cup sized kona pods packed much more tightly than any other pod i ever used my senseo . instructions kona pods say wiggle pods break up coffee before inserting into machine . kona pods feel very hard when taken out their package . i always wiggled jiggled pods 10 seconds before putting them senseo . after my problems kona pods , my husband decided i not ' wiggling ' them enough . he promptly wiggled one point it broke open . so , there just so much pod before putting it machine . first thing i noticed amount coffee brewed when using kona pod quite bit less than when using 2 smaller pods . not make much sense , but after several cups kona , it obvious there never amount coffee coming out before when using 2 small one cup pods . best i figure out kona pods themselves seem ' hold ' lot more water . there more water remains pod itself after brewing . pod itself heavier when i take it out throw it away . so , i believe reason there less actual coffee using kona pods pods themselves retain lot more water it cannot pass through into coffee cup . then , others mentioned , there problem happens me 1/2 time when using kona pods . problem whatever reason , water not actually go through penetrate kona pods during brewing cycle . ' coffee ' supposed coming out spout just water ! this problem one i still cannot really figure out . kona pods little smaller diameter than all other pods i tried . so , i guess somehow water enough room ' go around ' actual pod come out spout without ' going through ' pod brew coffee . i also wonder if paper filter kona pods different than other pods some reason kona paper more difficult water penetrate . i tried wetting kona pod paper filter right before starting brew coffee thinking perhaps it would help water penetrate paper pod . but , not worked me . so , it back regular more reasonably priced coffee pods me . i wasted too many expensive kona pods trying get proper cup coffee them . even when kona pods brew cup coffee , it not large amount coffee i get using other brands . so , adding cost kona pods fact it brews smaller amount coffee equals product way too expensive when it actually work . i reading product called ecopod . it refillable pod these type coffeemakers . it might next thing i try .	-1
imagine giving fairly expensive gift no one knows you gave it . that what happened this one . completed order , wrote nice note note never arrived . maybe i should greatful they actually sent product . omaha steaks off my vendor list .	-1
i agree completely previous reviewer -- this licorice not even come close usual quality ofharibo candy . this stuff dry hard , it leaves your hands sticky waxy grease . flavor -- what little there -- just weird : kind fake floral . not recommended	-1

product description says this tea ' slightly sweet ' well bunch other descriptors , but i didn't get any sweetness all . i very optimistic because i normally love everything tazo offers , but this time i my hopes dashed . i brewed up mug this tea immediately alarmed bouquet . teabag smelled different , but once hot water hit it smell seemed really magnify . but i scooped few teaspoons sugar hoped best . i managed choke down third cup before i called it day . life too short drink something you don't like . however , i read review mentioned how good palatable this tea when combined tazo lotus . i figured it worth shot , otherwise i'd throw out this tea altogether . lotus smelled great , so i excited . i blended two bags ( one lotus one wild sweet orange ) large mug , then removed wild sweet orange after minute . i left lotus minute or two ( yeah , definitely two ) . result very unusual , but not unappealing , beverage . would i drink this more than once day ? no . it very interesting something i'll try again ? yes . live learn , i guess .	-1
i read other reviews greatly excited order this entree . i bought 2-3 varieties tasty bite my local trader joes . most decently healthy all easy fast make . peas paneer , entree , bland without any heat/spice . i am native indian so i handle relatively spicy food . however , this entree not merit even 2-chili rating ( out four ) . food quality , i would suggest microwaving rice entree separately . otherwise , majority sauce seeps into rice giving it very unpleasant appearance . if you boil pouches ( alternate option ) , you may even more success . however , most us buy these because ease preparation , so boiling isn't convenient option . rice tastes looks it should . finally , i recommend tasty bite entr�e , jaipur vegetables . i am box nine twelve still not tired . this entree much spicier - closer 3.25 chili rating ( out four ) . i also favor this entree because it doesn't throw-away plastic container each box . moreover , you get 12-boxes better price than 6-boxes peas paneer . i look forward trying other tasty bites , though i likely sample flavors trader joe before ordering 6- or 12-box set . no more tasty bite purchases gold box unless i already tried particular flavor - lesson learned	-1
i drinking green tea years , love not only taste but smell too . when i opened up box this tea i thought i standing over old ash tray ! it smells horrid doesn't infuse well into water . i steeped table spoon it five minutes water color barely changed . i highly recommend you not buy this tea . exotic product aside , plain old lipton green tea bags grocery store far better	-1

this cocoa gritty bitter taste . dark chocolate mint particularly bitter . we don't care chocolate raspberry chocolate vanilla flavors either . chocolate supreme flavor sweeter tastier than other flavors , but child our family still remarked his cocoa " tasted strange " . there many non-gourmet commercial mixes smoother , more palatable less expensive than this gourmet brand . we won't buy this cocoa again . this gift box selection very handsomely packaged looks great holiday gift baskets . but cocoa fails taste test .	-1

i actually anxiously waiting try these since reviews mixed but i am soooooo glad i try them bec now i am hooked !!!! yes , they bit expensive when compared pasta but i think it paying some extra bucks remove some pounds off ! i make sure i rinse them really well cold water right before i boil them around 5 minutes which removes all bad smell ! i just add some marinara sauce it deal ! i found texture actually good , like firmer version ramen noodles ! i think these make excellent snack or meal !	1

it ain't spaghetti , folks , but used properly it enhance your eating . it great wet , soupy type dish . eaten " " ( after rinsing ) noodles very soft tender , too soft pass dry italian type pasta , unless you always cook dry pasta death . boiling them minute or two firms them up somewhat , but they never become firm properly cooked dried pasta . reviewer who said pasta out due his/her type 2 diabetes ... it not ! i'm same boat , we still enjoy pasta , we just need measure it control carb servings always use whole grain types slow down sugar load . i weigh out 2 oz . before cooking 2 carb exchanges ( 1/2 cup serving measurement absurd because different types pasta fill cup differently ) , i use bulkier additions like chunky vegetables big salad side . oil vinegar salad dressing helps further temper blood sugar rush . course , if you eat lots carbs breakfast lunch , don't plan 2 carb servings pasta dinner . i given up ( white ) italian bread side ! that worst part , but pasta least do-able .	1
i read this product hungry girl website . it listed amazon supplier . i read all reviews decided place order . it took longer than i expected arrive , since i pay extra shipping i thought it would here sooner . extra shipping must cool pack box it shipped . noodles little chewier than regular pasta . but like regular pasta didn't really taste their own took taste what ever sauce you use . i really like them . diabetic , it great pasta alternative not raise my blood sugar . i didn't find unpleasant smell when i opened bag reviewer wrote . just same i rinse them well . i since found them local health food store so i won't pay high shipping any more . i not able find spaghetti type anywhere , only flat noodle type i would really like try spaghetti . i would recommend this product any one wants lower carb , lower calorie pasta	1

first time i encountered haribo gummi bears when i went germany semester overseas . i won bag these classroom prize . first , i thought these going ordinary gummy bears , but , boy i wrong . these candies truly step above all other gummy bears . germany , this brand gummy bears . competitors ' bags sold much lower prices , but few people buy them - that because difference quality taste noticeable . other people reviews regarding sweetness softness accurate . haribo found perfect combination . during rest my stay germany , i became huge consumer haribo candies . haribo sells other gummy candies , but their " gold bears " best . when i returned beautiful america , i disappointed find haribo not so easy acquire . they sold online other stores decent prices but after shipping , cost quite steep . i am truly excited see these bears offered amazon free super-saver shipping . if you never haribo gummi bears , you really need try some . 5-pound bag seems like large quantity , but i promise , you not disappointed	1

first all , i agree above reviewers who thought this wasn't great fruit dip . second , there very little marshmallow flavor-this stuff nothing like regular marshmallow fluff . however , i still give this 5 stars , because it got features you can't get anywhere else . texture smooth pudding ( grainy reviewer perhaps ate his past expiration date ? ) that mainly how i use this . because slightly sharp taste cellulose , this dip lends itself very well making citrus puddings ( just add 1/4 cup lemon concentrate stir , doesn't get any easier than ) . i also use it make cheesecake other dessert recipes . actually make good fruit dip out this , try mixing it yogurt or cream cheese	1

i bought few bags these noodles after reading very favorable review them hungry girl website , i am glad i . they work well number different recipes , filling , add " calcium boost " dishes i use them , very few calories . these not " pasta " type noodles , course - texture different ( softer kind " slippery " ) , they virtually no flavor their own - they take flavor whatever sauce or dressing you use them . i probably won't use these noodles european-style or american-style sauces such marinara or cheese sauce - those types sauces created grain-based pastas , which these not . other hand , these noodles fine such asian recipes pad thai , lo mein dan-dan noodes ( basically , noodles spicy peanut or sesame sauce ) . there lot asian-style recipes cookbooks internet which fairly easy make , taste terrific , work beautifully these noodles . you prepare yourself real treat , if you use these noodles types recipes work well their texture , fraction calories you'd eat if using regular noodles or rice . short , if you attempt something like spaghetti meatballs or chicken cacciatore using these noodles , you're likely disappointed , but if you use them pad thai , any type curry , other asian dishes , or most soups , you're likely find yourself enjoying delicious wonderfully low-cal , low-carb meal . one thing - when you open bag , there slight ammonia-like odor ( it smells ammonia-like me , anyway ) . if you rinse noodles well then parboil them few minutes , per package directions , odor really disappear . it not strong odor , it won't permeate your kitchen or anything like , but you definitely want rinse parboil noodles before using them . just follow package directions	1

rings-ding best snacks out there many reasons . first off , they best after dinner snacks out there . it really like cake , just more condensed not fatty or filling . also , these things addicting . my life , i cannot even count how much packs i consumed , since i eating these things everyday since i young , let just say now i am very old . if you cannot afford drugs , then go ring-ding . only negative these things if there isn't enough cream , then you get mouthful chocolate . most people i know like chocolate , but i personally would not like mouthful it . bad thing summer , they melted only slightly revived if refrigerated . they kind lose good flavor edge summer , which makes this perfect snack winter . alright ... anatomy ring-ding ( dun-dun-dun ) . first off , you get chocolatey outside pretty soft . center creamy sensation ( sorry if sounded dirty ... get your mind out gutter ) really makes this product go good great . put together you get probably best snack out there right now . they come two pack made drake . usually , drake shadow hostess , yet i feel drake destroys hostess terms their cakes . if you actually reading this , please don't destroy me saying ring-ding totally annihilates anything hostess ever put out . wow ... i managed make food product two paragraphs long ( two short paragraphs i should say ) . i would put whole history ring-ding , but would probably taking someone else work . i guess i'll stop now . anyway , ring-ding win !!	1

once you see book accompanies this starter kit , you realize two things . you won't making sushi anytime soon without few more items . not only you need fresh ingredients , you need things listed recipes make miso , make number-one dashi number-two dashi . you need bonito flakes kombu , you need things like bamboo leaves too . ok , so you don't need bamboo leaves , but bamboo plant around house wouldn't hurt . book especially helpful , but make sushi rice professionally , you need also order rice-cooling tub ( hangiri ) . square omelet pan needed , but not essential . you adapt using regular pan . just add your fresh ingredients understatement year . you get sushi press , sushi mat nishiki sushi rice . sushi nori essential ginger , wassabi , soy sauce , rice vinegar , sweet wine ( mirin ) white sesame seeds . other items you want hand when this arrives : chopsticksginger graterchopping boardfish knives ( sushi knives)plates serving sushi ( not essential but make it more interesting)skewers - when you cook shrimprice makerstainless steel colanderwooden rice paddle - or you use wooden spooningredients : avocadoscucumbercarrotsasparaguschiveseggplantdaikon radishfresh shiitake mushroomslotus rootkombumiso pasteocha - teasakeshiso - aromatic herbsnow peassushi vinegar called awasezutofu - various types but japanese silken recommendedwakame seaweedrecommended seafood selections include : mackerel , salmon , crabs , blue-eye cod , tuna , herring , sea bass numerous other selections . i making mine cooked fish most part many recipes indicate cooking shrimp . book gives excellent full-color picture step-by-step instructions preparingseafood . everything cleaning squid angled cuts sahimi . prepare learn ancient art form . this serious cooking gourmet appeal . there instructions making garnishes dipping sauces . tuna rolls probably going one first items make because they few ingredients you don't need anything except rice cooker , sushi vinegar rolling mat . california-roll-style temaki-zushi also look fairly tame . nigiri-zushi made sushi bars seem little more complex . make simple inari-zushi you need tofu there extensive instructions how make little packets or pouches rice . these seem very interesting i've tasted them before definitely look forward trying make them . idea chirashi-zushi rice bowl interesting not require great deal artistic application . so , if you want make full sushi meal , it gets little more complex , but you try out various recipes master " dashi " which like fish stock/soup made kombu bonito flakes . this knowledge course needed make sushi rice , which leads me right back needing hangiri . i suppose you use glass bowl instead . this sushi kit truly only brief start artistic journey . even after ordering this you may find you need few more items before you start taking steps direction actually making sushi . i report back i try various recipes all i say this require adventurous spirit few more amazon orders . once you sushi book , things start become more clear you make list things order . ~ rebecca review	1

" throughout india , chai wallahs found serving cups decaffeinated chai souls who naturally seek inner beauty slightly gentler pace . " if you like your chai peppery kick , then this tea interest you . rooibos , cinnamon , ginger , decaffeinated black tea , cardamom , ginger , chicory , cloves , star anise other natural flavors seem take back seat delicious peppery flavor this tea . this tea tastes similar tea i first tasted africa , where rooibos tea grown . best served milk/powdered milk/soy milk or dash cream some honey . since this decaffeinated tea , it perfect late night writing sessions or when you want something calming drink doesn't taste like chamomile . ~ rebecca revie	1
this first tasty bite entree product i bought . i though it very good , very authentic-tasting . there lot sauce , you need some rice or bread sop up sauce . there not lot paneer cheese first packet i tried , maybe three small pieces . still , it excellent product	1
we purchased this ramen store specializes asian food . there numerous varieties ramen so you try many them find those you think best flavor . we bit apprehensive first time we tried this ramen . however , it since become one our favorites . spice hot , but it adds really good flavor noodles . real winner when you mood spicy food , or cold day . because this ramen very hot , we also mixed package this ramen package chicken ramen lower chemical heat . even such mixture soup still fairly hot . when i say hot , i mean spicy hot . many people medium hot incredibly hot , but i barely discern any spice medium hot salsa . i am accustomed eating spicy mexican food korean food , so when i say this soup hot , you good reference	1
i love hot sauce . i big fan other " insane " hot sauces , but problem them most part , they cannot put directly food , instead , they need diluted before they're okay consumption . not this hot sauce . it perfectly hot enough , yet not too hot eat straight out bottle . i put it everything : burger too blah normal condiments , el yucateco fix it ! shrimp cocktail not kicking , el yucateco show those shrimp who boss . i even use it bring salsas up proper level heat . it definitely hot . if all you're used normal , red-colored vinegar water , this hot sauce open your eyes set your mouth fire . but , if you're looking something good flavor that'll keep you coming back more , this stuff .	1
these best berries i've ever tasted ! i thought sure they sweetened , but they're not . berries they used must perfectly ripe flavor just blasts your mouth when you try them . additionally , slices whole , very little breakage . value you get pretty great , considering 8oz berries approximately equivalent 5# fresh strawberries . $3/lb (+ shipping ) that really not bad , you these year-round , even when strawberries aren't season	1
these so delicious ! they gave great variety cakes . when i say cakes , i mean sense they're little asian rice balls filled sweet bean paste , either mung bean or red bean . they're yummy light . i didn't care strawberry/grape jelly cakes , they seemed like fillers , but rest tasted good . refridgerate thm after day if you don't eat them immediately . they might dry out if you leave them box .	1
i drink this green tea yamamotoyama almost three years already . i am impressed quality taste . highly recommende	1

product description calls orangettes " belgian vitamin . " except luxury price , i'm sure belgians must pretty healthy these around . they're amazing ! combination orange peel chocolate long popular , but leonidas it very well . dark chocolate very rich , not bitter , completely covers orange peel ( which retains good flavor isn't overly sweet ) . unlike other chocolatiers who often dip peel only partially , leonidas made certain put their chocolate center stage using generous portion . result addictive treat because flavors linger palate orangettes aren't so sweet become cloying . i don't know if these guys really going improve your health , but they definitely improve your day . my opinion , they're worth money occasional purchase certainly worth one-time try . packaging gold box , wrapped blue white leonidas paper gilt deep purple box . shipping , package placed inside sturdy styrofoam shell . mine arrived within three days looked like i'd purchased them store give gift	1

i received fresh roast plus 8 30th birthday present my parents , which allowed me take my coffee snobbery entirely new level ! this model worked admirably 2+ months i've it , roasting one batch least every two days . it not automatic ( there isn't good roaster ) you need carefuly monitor color , aroma , " cracks " achieve consistent roast , but coffee it produces balanced , consistent , far away better than anything you buy store . negatives it feel mite flimsy : glass roasting chamber sits precariously fan unit could easily knocked off broken . also , it only roasts few ounces time -- perfect if you just want roast enough your morning cup , but don't expect able roast half or entire pounds coffee gifts . smoke pervasive , so it helpful roast beans under your stovetop exhaust fan , lest you set off smoke alarm . overall , this excellent product home roaster who just getting into world coffee roasting . should interest take hold little more , it would wise upgrade larger capacity table-top drum roaster , or used commercial machine	1
matcha tea exactly what i expected . extremely green , great flavor . keep mind i'm no way matcha expert but my limited experience this type tea ( starbucks , etc . ) it great . got product within days ordering it far before estimated date delivery . highly recommend this seller	1
i am gluten intolerent , or what ever you want call it . i get asthma wheat flour , so i've spent last 8 years searching perfect flour . i've using this years now , i love this stuff . i use it cookies , cakes , crepes , pancakes , waffles * , madalines , yorkshire pudding , flouring meats crispy frying , thickening soups sauces , etc etc . only thing it hasn't worked bisquits . i think because this flour needs binding agent , such eggs or xantham gum . just butter dough after baking falls apart . flakey yummy , but total mess ! it also tastes kind bitter raw , but once it baked or cooked it exactly same flavor texture wheat flour . you can't go wrong this alternative . go forth confidently experiment all your favorite recipes using this wonderful flour ! i love trying martha stewart cookie recipes , this flour works perfectly all i've tried . * some recipes may require little extra leavening agent ( baking soda or baking powder ) , such waffles , madalines pancakes .	1

i enjoying this mix quite some time . it great gluten-free way satisfy chocolate cravings . although brownies bit chewy side , i would highly recommend making cookie recipe shown bag . it makes really great chocolate cookies , definitely best gluten-free ones i come across mix so far . i even passed these off holiday parties regular chocolate cookies my guests loved them .	1
nicely seasoned , creamy texture . served over rice , one packet makes generous meal one , or would serve two something side . cooked simply boiling packet pot water until hot -- one relatively few prepared food options where microwave directions actually require more cleanup than stovetop option . makes good option backpacking , too , assuming weight acceptable . requires no refrigeration edible out packet spoon , cold if necessary	1

okay ... this one those foods i never guessed i'd making so often . college student , sure . maybe box once while young married couple . but new mom my motto " my child won't eating ... " . [ actually you could fill number items into space . ] yet , i find myself purveyor many , many meals involve noodles cheese . once awhile these may whole wheat organic noodles , but more often than not it one few foods my stubborn toddler-now preschooler eat : kraft macaroni cheese . pros -- lets face it biggest pro testy tikes eat it . let call it " tasty " then . -- meal quick 9 grams protein per serving . -- it no transfats unless you add them . -- provides 10% adult iron requirements-which translates even higher percentage children . cons -- cost buck per box amazon . -- since wheat flour `processed ' doesn't lot fiber ( 1 gram ) . -- processed flour probably means higher glycemic index ( though should moderated addition oil/butter milk . -- lots sodium ( 740 mg ) . -- lots calories ( 380 prepared per adult serving ) which not necessarily bad if you trying fill up toddler . four stars . my greatest wish would organic , whole wheat flax kraft mac cheese , but until day comes i am happy kraft makes tasty , affordable , meal box children eat . just add veg you ready go	1

" cucumbers 90% liquid ! " they told me , " no liquids any flights now !! " i strip-searched , questioned 6 hours , forced remove all liquid my bladder , held locked room overnight until authorities finally let me go . i come unpleasant realization terrorists winning . we never beat them if we always playing " catch-up " them , enacting new rules after they try something . it seems only way win declare indefinite martial law , place soldiers everywhere , arrest everyone suspicious . unfortunately this tactic didn't help soviets win cold war , besides -- if terrorists " hate us our freedom " aren't we just playing into their hands removing those freedoms ( which we seem doing little time now anyway) ? if we're going play into their hands , why not just cut chase give them what they want now -- defuse whole situation pushing free seperate palestine occupied west bank , remove our troops iraq saudi arabia ( substituing u.n. or nato peacekeeping force iraq ) . then they'd nothing fight anymore . al quaeda might seen heroes first , but would look craven evil most muslims if they continued try blow up infidels across globe , thus completely alienating them peaceful muslim majority . checkmate ! besides , we not " christian nation " most part ? shouldn't we follow christ example " turning other cheek " ? it hard believe simple cucumber could make me rethink all my long-held republican ideals ( mccain ' 08 , baby !! ) , but if i choose eternal war , humbling ( maybe embarassing ) peace , well . . . it no contest . when dirty , smelly hippy flashes " peace " sign me , i smile return favor . god bless america amazing cucumber !	1

my friend got me hooked hot chocolate angelina cafe paris , marie belle closest angelina i find states . it isn't like typical american hot chocolate . it very intense , dark chocolate flavor , undoubtably due 60-70% cocoa content chocolate shavings used omission vanilla flavoring . it also not sweet , which i came prefer after few cups . few recommendations would use milk ( you even use skim without hurting results ) , 1 cup milk instead 1/2 cup . if you get this product , i'd also recommend you invest aerolatte or some other milk frother . i could never get chocolate pieces evenly distributed without it . marie belle little pricey , but it worth every penny if you looking perfect hot chocolate .	1

deep purple/red color hibiscus fragrance enough make anyone passionate tea . yet , this really tea ? it looks like tea , but it really herbal infusion made steeping hibiscus flowers , orange peel , licorice , cinnamon , rose hips , lemongrass red poppy swirling hot water . flavor slightly reminiscent hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice . this tea leaves tingle your tongue i think it goes very well spoonful honey . i love tazo teas immersing myself mysterious experience sense abandon . so far i've tried most flavors always impressed . i think you need two tea bags each cup tea fully intoxicate senses experience magic ingredients . caffeine free . you drink this you type into night ... ~ rebecca review	1
i consumed two bags this green tea . it excellent quality tea , balanced flavor balanced terms sense well-being it imparts imbiber . it helps me concentrate better helps even out my moods . it feels like good detoxifier take after eating meal lot saturated fats or meat , partly because its anti-inflammatory effects . it less caffeine than regular tea or coffee . just enough caffeine give slight elevation mood , but not enough cause one hyper-concentrate feel mood swings . course , this tea consists loose leaves twigs , not tea bags . this important concept . typical supermarket , tea comes bags too much caffeine overly processed , which reduces its nutritional value dramatically . general , green tea bought popular brand supermarket not contribute reputation health green tea . this kind green tea natural form only kind . i brew it microwaving water boiling , then letting water cool couple minutes while stirring it spoon agitate out any oxygen dissolved water . then put heaping teaspoon tea it let it sit 3-4 minutes . very hot but not boiling water key . you likely find consuming natural forms green tea like this one , raw unroasted , far superior drinking most popular brands tea supermarket , or drinking coffee	1
