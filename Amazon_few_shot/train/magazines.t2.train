oh those days , when i college , reading my first issues then subscribing . there great things found its pages , columns brian crozier , russell kirk , erik von kuenhelt-leddhin ( sp ? ) . great struggle soviet union going into critical stage . it seemed nr so right track . it wonderful read , least 1979 1983 . but then it became while duller . it some periods recrudescence , such under editorship john o'sullivan . but when rich lowry took over nr really began dumb down ( nothing personal mr. lowry ) . but what i've really discovered late how badly neo-con agenda sort taken over magazine . we've got 50th anniversary issue call midge dector rally country our illegal immoral war iraq . really something happened magazine , sinister force entrenched itself there . what force ? well , go come-and-hear.com you begin learn part picture , especially when you read material elizabeth dilling . i would also recommend paul findley they dare speak out , which details israeli lobby domination our congress . nr once courageous conservative magazine , but now it heavily tainted influence terrible thing . wfb should know better , maybe he . if he doesn't , then he should pick up neo-conned ! neo-conned again !, then he should listen tony martin talk given ihr certain group tactics deployed suppress free speech . what inspired me write this review wfb recent column incarceration david irving . it ends disgusting gloating . wfb fallen into evil trap , so magazine he used run . what happened christian faith people like buckley ? he now seems lost terribly afraid offending supposedly saintly interest group ... you , mr. lowry , come now : read widely deeply don't afraid reading talmud israeli lobby . once you , maybe you'll develop strength think outside box . we're going if we want anything but bleakest future mankind planet .	1
this magazine just dares people pick most boring , pretentious , or ostentatious feature within any given issue . " town country " extremely old money venture , while it some good useful articles ( lovely advertisements things virtually nobody afford , ) much magazine essentially centered very elitist worldview grows very tiresome rather quickly . " town country " initially recommended me because ostensibly good coverage travel architecture , two areas i great interest . applicable aside , when i read list tips offshoot " town country travel " publication ways ease stress long range flights , i realized there reality check due when one first tips always fly first class , ignoring fact vast majority readers would rather buy car what typical first class ticket europe or asia costs . i mentioned , there some good articles , there occasionally better more useful offshoot publications like " town country travel " eminently more readable ( although they still insist advertising things like seven million dollar vacation homes coast , etc . ) i say photography always good , you believe if it appears here it finest most fashionable available : hyacinth bucket would , no doubt , like seen reading this magazine . despite occasionally worthwhile features , i find " town country " excessively pompous , therefore i recommend finding publication focused whatever area interest you , whether it fashion , society , or travel .	1

first off , i usually just stick rating critiquing movies . but , every time i see ad this website this time/warner ( or whatever hell company calls itself this week ) rag-mag i start see red . " entertainment weekly " , which once interesting weekly deluge ho-hum everyday life , become just rag crapped out weekly stand newstands week after week prostituting your hard earned cash . back summer 89 , " ew " released after i read few issues , i decided subscribe . i instantly hooked ( new issue would arrive my mailbox saturday before it would hit regular newstands ) i liked getting latest news reviews movies , music , t.v. , video ( later added mid-90 ) . problem magazine started late 90 . i started notice " ew " would cover big movie or event hadn't yet released then following week bash hell out it , or try get some piece dirt it order generate more sales . i also hate damn lists " ew " comes up . latest entitled " top 100 most memorable movie lines " joke . these lists always annoyed me , because i feel they truly not thought out therefore not thought provoking . other most important thing i noticed absolute lack honest review . case point , few weeks ago i picked up latest issue which movie " catwoman " reviewed ( i wasn't sure if it gleiberman or shwarzbaum critiqued it ) . i first logged onto " rotten tomatoes.com " see what percentile " catwoman " recieved nation critics . out roughly 115 reviews " catwoman " only got 10% good reviews while rest trashed it ( film needs , least , get grade 60 - 65% order place it fresh or good movie ) . makes " catwoman " worst reviewed film , so far , 2004 . yet , " ew " gave film . what erkes me even more " catwoman " released " warner bros . " , same company owns rights " harry potter " films , " lord rings " trilogy , yes , " wb " owns " entertainment weekly " . " warner bros . " trying bribe or threaten its own critics one its most popular lucrative magazine ? i'm not only who seen this developement . people written saying there favoritism among " warner " products reviewed magazine . " ew " , course , hotly denies anything kind thumping there chests standing behind there reviews , possibly fear fired ( they deny also ) . my only question reviewers " entertainment weekly " , " whats it like stand your own pile bull**it ? " or better yet , " what it like stand democratic podium ? "	-1
i subscribed modern bride gift my fiance . aside not receiving our first issue until 3 months after subscription , i only received 3 issues total . months went without anything delivered . while customer service modern bride very accomodating helpful , nothing happens immediately . when planning wedding , each every month precious . especially during initial stages wedding planning . finally gotten this subscription problem under control exhausting . plus , this time most wedding details finalized , magazines i received became useless . if you're under 12 months your wedding date , you should strongly consider if now good time begin subscription modern bride	1

like " where waldo " , it seems every issue must least one , if not several mies van der rohe daybeds . while this admitedly classic piece furniture , one gets impression there gaggle designers telling their clients , " you one these , they're what ! " most features metropolitan home suffer same fate ; dreary antiseptic homes same dreary interiors obviously foisted upon gullible , uninformed clients designers who know how make easy buck . " modern " equals , course , mies van der rohe daybed ( notice how many times it shows up this review ? ) , otherwise you get month after month 1970 florals , faux louis whatever tables . even using feature extraction , wading through dreck finding something useable your own purposes , it painful look through this magazine . if you really want ideas making your house reflect you , trust yourself what you like , if you like mies van der rohe daybeds , all means get one . just don't plunk one your sun room because you told it trendy . if you like modern style , look up works hans wegner peter hvidt go there ; their furniture still looks stylish after 50 years hard use real families sturdy well . maybe you want house where nobody allowed set foot any rooms amounts bad hodge-podge styles all seem bit busy bumpy . everyone else , think things you'd like see if you walked into room , save your money skip this magazine	-1

i read rolling stone music those who make it , not some guilt ridden , agenda blasting editorial team feels their politics ( guilt so much establishment they wish they could hate ) something we should all read nauseum . when they stick music , it good , when they parade their shreiking political views , it boring .	1
i subscriber 15 years still enjoy magazine . no , its not best magazine music , but it one best general pop culture news i still occassionally find new artists because magazine , though i tend find more new movies now . however , if you ever problem customer service , forget it . i never got my copy 1,000 issue , when i asked replacement , i told they out issue , but would extend my subscription one issue . i pointed out it double issue they still selling back issues their web site $20 . if they don't resolve it quick , i might just cancel my subscription , i'm so disgusted .	-1
our library just finished its magazine usage count , my surprise american spectator came dribbling only couple hits , measured current copies left table check outs older issues . yet our patronage here very conservative . perhaps people who once read this sort thing no longer read all , or maybe , couple reviewers suggested , bill clinton out office , it no longer same appeal . you change my rating five stars if you like , sake ideology , but you still won't read thing . just like i don't read nation anymore	-1
i've loyal subscriber since 1998 always enjoyed magazine . something happened them early 2006 - they've either bought or hired new editor / staff or something . this magazine absolutely terrible now . all ads , fewer fewer pictures babes each issue , hilarious articles now long gone . my last two issues ( sept oct ) trash within minutes pulling them my mailbox . i'm canceling my subscription .	-1

nice cover pictures headlines , but way too many ads . there reason its only twelve bucks , this ad-sponsored mag	1
this definitely magazine gearheads . it pretty much just equipment reviews advertisements . i would given it higher rating but two things : 1 ) i don't think i've ever seen popular photography not love any piece equipment . reviews still useful if you're just wondering what features new gizmo , but still , they ought bit more critical if they're going such review based magazine . 2 ) many ads vendors bad reputations . i believe they make some sort claim requiring certain level honesty anyone they sell ad space , but it sure doesn't look like they ever kicked anyone out magazine me . so what you when you magazine full uncritical reviews , occasional beginnerish article technique , lot ads stores dubious virtue ? best 2 star magazine	1

legend goes there time few decades ago when " gramophone " unquestioned authority reviews recordings classical music . whether or not legend true ( i'm too young know ) , gramophone time definitely passed . today there multitude sources free information classical music internet , newsgroups websites . some it less well-informed than gramophone criticism , but some it more well-informed . what undeniable , price few mouse-clicks , it possible find far greater range reviews recordings internet than gramophone ( its british-based critics ) offer . what more , gramophone tied business-model classical music industry fast becoming obsolete . historically , most important classical recordings issued few so-called " major " companies such emi , deutsche grammophon cbs ( later sony ) . these " majors " would buy lavish advertising spreads gramophone so finance magazine . return , gramophone would devote lengthy reviews majors ' new releases would produce pages fluffy interviews musicians under contract majors . today situation different . most interesting new release more likely appear mp3 obscure russian website than new cd sony . small companies , dedicated solely classical music recordings , produce great results shoestring budgets while " major " corporations virtually abandoned new classical recordings . this development causes problems gramophone business model . new players classical music industry don't publicity budgets fund glossy magazine like gramophone through advertising . gramophone implicit bargain : " advertise us or we won't review your recordings " , magazine seems becoming more more irrelevant . if you want subscribe classical music periodical , i recommend " international record review " or " fanfare " . both offer substantially more reviews per month than gramophone . but most all , i suggest checking out huge range classical music information available free web usenet	1

i charter subscriber this magazine when it started up publication . it breath fresh air stagnant field almost universally wretched photography magazines . over years things changed . columnists died or moved . editorial directions switched . articles once inspired now only offered consumerist bullfeathers . when digital photography became dominant marketplace , " outdoor photographer " vanguard , pushing every gadget photoshop manipulation plug-in popped up . magazine became wasteland promises better pictures if you just buy _____ ( fill blank whatever current trend might ) . what i thought ironic time best photographs they printed photographers using least sophisticated equipment . photographers using film (!?) , lot large format guys , occasionally some black white stuff made cameras just any serious hobbist already owned . but these portfolios began dwindle occasional rare almost non-existent . some point , my interest this garbage lapsed before my subscription . magazine made once monthly trip mailbox trashcan without even opening it until they finally stopped sending it . " outdoor photographer " impresses people who measure quality photography whether or not equipment used production cost equivalent gross national product small third world countries . it offers little way nutrition hungry mind . it empty calories , just making you want more more while starving your potential . it truly wretched .	-1
i told this magazine good look design ideas . it isn't really , there isn't really much this magazine . it just tired old aoltimewarner publication , just like time , people , or teen people . i looked august september issues only things those two impressed me features elton john out africa fundraiser article julian mcmahon . rest it ads , not classy type ads make advertising tolerable vogue magazine , but same old ads you'll see anywhere else , they annoying . there several nonsense fashion articles likes kelly ripa ( post excessive photoshop airbrushing tools-one my professors would call it " plastic person syndrome " ) mark consuelos , waay too much jennifer garner her baby , other weird things , such trend designer cupcakes . i wish i kidding latter , but i am not , nor i $25 spend glorified cupcake just because it jessica alba favorite . there entirely too much dress/act/eat/shop/play this way because stars it way here . despite size this magazine , there very little sink ones teeth into , just way too many photos same old same old , tips mimicking them . i am not interested becoming teri hatcher clone , nor am i interested seeing vanessa carlton pad . this magazine you if you like excessive ads , no diversity , subscription actually not year ( it says special issues count regular issues magazine ) your life ambition try cupcake bakery new york because some celebrity . this magazine mediocre best , worst part , it exact same fashion advice vogue . i went vogue because there substance their magazine , ads classy very chic . leave this one behind-it looks me like brain fluff read folks aol time warner .	1

i began subscribing gourmet 1961 , continued subscribe forty years . i also gifted family members subscriprions . i discontinued my subscription because magazine deteriorated so much last several years : there so many ads tear-outs magazine one hardly find recipes , least half magazine , sometimes more ; also i object " political , " some downright offensive , articles . i am catholic , i very offended outrageous article charging , during nazi era , naked jews made crawl through streets their knees persons , which article linked some way catholic church . i think information apochryphal ; , what this food ?	-1
today i purchased my first probably last issue gourmet . while there plenty recipes ( some which i won't use but they still cool look ) there tons ads . it makes you wonder either ) how much people who make this magazine get paid or ) all ads why this isn't free . i see need few ads so we consumers don't pay fortune good magazine . but i took out 33 pages ads figured there 140 full page ads . that over half magazine which 260 pages . that really sad . recipe wise , some them look interesting very gourmet , but there things you need i can't get middle u.s. three six articles interesting read - when you could find them slipped inbetween their plethora ads . fine cooking still best one out there	-1

back 1970 my grandmother subscribed prevention . time , it wonderful magazine , filled informative articles aimed " prevention " illness promotion wellness ( founder prevention , j.i. rodale preached ) . articles role vitamins nutrition light years ahead their time . ( j.i. given lot credit bringing vitamins supplements mainstream ) . over years , especially after tragic death robert rodale ( . i . ' son ) , takeover his wife daughter , it unfortunately transformed into fluffy , tabloid-like " women magazine " scantily clad women covers , one- or two-page articles instructing women get killer abs burn fat . i think j.i. rodale probably spinning his grave see what his descendents butcher this magazine , which bears no resemblence whatsoever what it used . i flipped through copy disgust recently note , reviewer stated , plenty ads drugs which really seems go against idea preventing illness first place ( whereas old prevention sang praises vitamins health foods ) . i don't know why rodale family doesn't just scrap title call it something else , but alas , they major corporation now i little hope this magazine improve any time soon	-1
friend once said me , " if you want glossy no brainer then get vogue ! " how right she , despite glorious photography , fashion models daren't stand sideways or you wouldn't able see them occasional good article it , i admit i find vogue too pretentious . vogue wants voice fashion , voice high brow media but its clientele likes you me , ordinary people who can't afford live high life they portraying its gloss filled pages . personally i'd rather spend my money movie ticket , i get see good thriller , sci-fi , romance etc , etc i don't know substence abuse emotional demons haunt particular actor life , i'm just interested enjoying myself couple hours before i go back my hard working life real world . vogue trying sell me dream i don't really want buy into , never penchant selling my soul devil , it gets two stars though because photography really superb , shame rest it though	1
i would like classify myself moderate but i probably lean conservative . because , i subscribed harpers so i could read good writing would challenge my beliefs stretch my mind new ways . i got , more or less , first , but over course couple years magazine drifted further further leftist propaganda screed , worst which louis lapham bitter drivel editorials . it got point where writing incredibly predictable ; i knew exactly what position ( read : left pelosi ) writer -- any writer harpers -- would take whatever issue , i pretty good idea what line whining would . if you attend dinner parties upper east side ; if you drive prius oscars ; if you think commercial organic farming environmental travesty ; if you've ever desecrated starbucks , then look no more -- this magazine you . however , if you're dumbfounded how republicans keep winning elections -- then you realize they democratic party opponents ; if you realize genius george bush karl rove getting liberals underestimate george bush karl rove ; if you want read smart , insightful writing inform entertain , then try atlantic monthly ( which , way , i am surprised see reviewers describe liberal magazine ; i think it moderate , if anything , bit conservative side . ) needless say , i let my harpers subscription lapse . two stars , tho , harper index -- however , wasn't worth price subscription ( it got only thing worth anything price subscription ) .	1

this magazine reads like inflight magazine : something airlines , careful not stir any scary adreneline rushes , put out lull their readers sleep . not controversy here . no thought-provocation . don't you wish someone out there would publish really good magazine books ? one featured meaty stories well-written reviews ? well , alas , this one ain't it . it dull bland . occasionally it offers up conservative book review neocon writer catherine seipp , who enlightening bill o'reilly ( , entertaining offensive laughably stupid ) so this sometimes cut dull . but someone here said bland i agree . avoid this one if you iq above 90 . pick up new yorker , atlantic monthly or harper if you like read intelligent writing . or , if you like romance novels , mysteries other badly written pieces fluff -- which all this magazine covers -- this might just thing you . i want my money back	-1

i agree those who didn't care it . only thing i liked one article written dad who skateboarding his son . it witty , insightful inspirational . rest mag just seemed totally irrelevent my life . it aimed people who dry-clean their childrens clothes . anyone ? i don't want my kids concerned clothes money . few issues i read made me mad depressed . i've never written review before but felt compelled so regarding this lame magazine . give me break $400 cashmere hoodie my son ! my son likes his vilified character t-shirts what matters . he not reflection my style , he reflection his own . get over yourselves	1
i suscribed this magazine since i got great offer it company i get my other suscriptions so i decided , why not ?? its year , although previews each week prime-time programs fun ( 2 pages worth ) i very dissapointed . articles empty , boring some downright retarded ; rehashing show dialogues , requoteing newscomments - its mistery me how this magazine still around . i realize this entertainment magazine , but still , articles people magazine seem like rocket science comparison - gasp !!! yourself favor just buy tv guide - much more interestin	1
i've subscriber this over 10 years i've loved getting this , but it undergone changes recently not better . specifically , i hate what they've graphical design inside . whereas they used employ several different styles when it came things like fonts artwork whatever subject written , now they've adopted uniform style where nearly everything looks same . it looked better before . writing isn't witty or sharp ( longtime staff departed ? ) , there " filler " pieces form moronic sidebars boxes - useless attempts humor simply don't work . strength magazine continues come critics , especially movie dvd section . sadly , typically , when changes like this occur they almost never revert back so it looks like i'm going consider letting my sub expire ' cos i don't let my mailbox fill crap like this	1

don't purchase subscriptions amazon or magazine express . following my experiences subscription hiragana times amazon . what this page doesn't tell you japanese magazines subscribed amazon filled company called magazine express shipped seamail japan which mean you'll recieve every issue 8 10 after it released . i placed my order january , date , not recieved single issue . after several phone calls , magazine express people ( who fill amazon subscriptions ) said they restart my subscription may issues which take 8-10 weeks due shipping issues . so after ordering january , i not receive single issue this uncancelable magazine until possibly late july . very poor service . this unacceptable magazine most us japanese bookstores ( fujisan one ) get within week or you order directly publisher only few dollars more . if i known shipping policy i would not ordered magazine supplier , magazine express not cancel subscrition . i advise avoiding all amazon magazine subsriptions due their poorly stated policies . ** update , i wrote this review june . it now july 8th i've just informed i must wait until august 15th see if issue arrives . i ordered magazine january 9th i no resolution either magazine express or amazon who provides no way contact anyone within amazon magazine orders . i reiterate , buying magazines amazon if poor idea	-1
well , imagine my surprise when i picked up february 2004 issue , found things drastically changed . mainly editor letter . it used 1 page , now it just small little column now , exactly like other ziff davis game mags , now redesign isnt bad other zd game mags , but removal 1 page editor letter , really steams me up . least they didnt bother executive editor robert coffey scorched earth column . it still 1 page . it last page usually . yes redesign really bad terms readability . most time they red or blue or yellow background , it really hard read text times . now least their disc auto-load , unlike pc gamer . what really pisses me off , when magazine hot 100 section , or best pc or videocards , or peripherals section , they hardly ever change captions or descriptions come it . i'm sorry if i got off track lot , but i felt need . i hope this review helped you . edit : 5/8/2004 pc gamer recently changed editor editor-in-chief re-assigned become editor-in-chief official xbox magazine . new eic pcg former executive editor , i hate him , so this why i say cgw now best pc games magazine	1
i got this magazine year half before i quit my subscription recently . i liked all fashion tips articles how dress your body size style , why i subscribed begin . but i not expecting bombardment amoral opinions forced me . ( not mention overload advertising- which you get most fashion magazines anyway , so that not complaint ) . sure there few lines here there nonbiased ( telling facts stds such ) , but 90% articles sex , opinion not fact . girls today sex anyone getting hurt emotionally physically because magazines like seventeen who say sex good if you're ready ( what 15 year old girl ready sex get std or baby ?? please . ) , condoms 100% effective . they not , but that what most teen girls believe because stupid magazines like this . they need take advice their parents doctors , not magazine articles . i disgusted opinions presented truth basically promote teen girls doing whatever they want without consequences .	1
admittedly , i am slightly older than " relevant " demographic . but i'm not 40 yet ! so there number things here some appeal me . i applaud magazine attempting address culturally important issues . still , magazine suffers it unrelenting fawning over whole post-modern vibe it own sense self-importance beacon charismatic hipness . ( " hey , look out , world ! we jesus freaks ipods too ! " ) usually , more something or someone sweats proclaim their own relevance , more danger there they become irrelevant . so , like it spiritual cousin " charisma , " this magazine suffers somewhat shallow perspective life culture . it trumpets its ability ask " tough questions , " even it follows relatively safe , politically correct post-mod/charismatic/hipster wannabe party line . i mean , their idea cutting edge put bono cover . if you want cutting edge , put libertine adam clayton cover ask him bono faith . now , i would read article ! ( i am major u2 bono fan . i'm not knocking him ; just lack imagination " relevant " . ) there also way too much emulation world perspective generational heritage . " hey , we're young , we're smart , we don't need anything way our geezer parents it . " i guess little gray hair or wrinkles doesn't cut it today paris hilton culture , but i'd like think it might little different culture shaped biblical values . actually , " relevant " seems little afraid say what " biblical values " ( beyond obvious politically expedient ones ); it all seems amorphous here . i've never fan whole " what hot/what not " ethos . , i'd like give little more respect today christian young people think they could handle something didn't fall into same faddish trap . i am hopeful they may get it right yet " relevant " . times , they seem tantilizingly close . but it takes more than slick hairdo , male earrings , chin stubble , idolization youth , culture icon quotations , psycobabble " cool dude " theological lingo make one relevant	1
first off , i subscribed this magazine couple years , enjoyed it . but " main guy " robert kennedy , someone who offends me both personally politically . he assumes every girl/women reading magazine tiny . his information , some us work out 5-6 days week eat well , still heavy-set . his comments heavy-set people offensive , thoughtless , sometimes even downright cruel . nonetheless , pictures/articles inspiring me , it decent fitness magazine	1

i used enjoyed discover , but past several months their radicals changes , got me think real dumbing down . once awhile , they would put together good article - but not constantly . how we enlighten ourselves improve our intelligence science etc world stage . there still many us not want glued computer science we would tv . discover editorial staff ought get their magazine back track or circulation subscriber base going go down tube . thank goodness scientific american , astronomy , sky telescope , science news havent fallen down . i am not renewing my subscription unless discover ' rediscovers ' itself . how dumb americans !	1
i am also longtime subscriber , i am quite outraged new changes made magazine . i written letter editor containing my list grievances , if you ( i would hope they would redressed but they probably ignore me ) . anyway , please read : i am current subscriber , quite suprised discover new look ( all reading this review amazon.com: amazon.com not display updated version what discover currently looks like ) . i didn't quite care it , but long material stayed same i going allright it . unfortunately , articles discover degenerated into " top 20 things you didn't know ... " lists , piles trivia , some sexual humor editorializing recent news . sure , reading gay astronauts may little humorous . it appropriate what discover stood or what i expected this magazine ? i would disagree . occasionally there intelligent article . cover story still seems up par stories old discover . i really once enjoy this magazine it most expected item arrive my mailbox . i've kept all my copies last five years best condition i possibly could because i truly enjoy reading them , still . maybe this new discover " new generation " or meant lure younger or less mature readers , but i think change articles taken turn worse . i think ordinary person , " lay man " if you , would appreciate least intelligent articles new , interesting groundbreaking discoveries scientific community . i remember string theory article ( i forget which issue exactly ) one most well-written articles topic . it very exciting , most importantly it [ i]got me interested science[/i ] . i doubt i ever see anything good discover magazine again . i'd really hate give up this magazine : all i ask old discover back .	1

i echo same gripe other reviewers voiced here : magazine covers same handful people week after week after boring week . how many times reader going see no talents such jessica simpson , lindsay lohan , tom cruise-katie holmes joke , most overrated , overhyped people all time brad pitt angelina jolie cover not get tired it ? it nice know what going certain celebrities once while but every single week ? you say " overkill ? " i'm glad i never got subscription this magazine . i picked it up every once while newsstand but stopped because i so sick tired reading overrated , overhyped glorified b-movie " actors " " actresses " who lucky one successful movie haven't anything value since . i picked up copy today sworn it off forever . don't waste your time or your money . - donna di giacom	1
this magazine just page after page hollywood p.r. agencies releases . unbelievable . why didn't i think it ? i know all magazines look editorial content outside sources , but other than few pages very subjective movie/music/book reviews , this magazine just re-writes prints hollywood press release after hollywood press release again again again . this magazine must not staff writers , but must employ army copy editors manning warehouse dedicated fax machines or e-mail inboxes . funniest thing this magazine how first few pages may dedicated typically obsequious press release provided , say , tom cruise management company/major film studio/hired pr flak fawning over cruise or his newest movie - then you turn movie review section where some clever , sassy , wanna-be hipster movie reviewer proceeds tell you movie absolutely sucks . uh , okay - wait , didn't you get press release ? if you tivo extra theme entertainment tonight your ringtone , this magazine right up your alley . otherwise , don't waste penny this nonsense .	-1
i ordered journal year ago received 2 issues , never received issue . i contacted customer service problem , used problem report forms(or whatever it called ) never heard them again . i get this email today telling me renew my subscription ...

if you're teenage guitarist want learn nickelback , green day , nu-metal songs , then this magazine you . there also some pretty good tips beginners time time . but last several years quality feature articles interviews gone steadily downhill , there far too many ads . many people said , sometimes it doesn't seem geared towards musicians all anymore . smarmy , " hipper than thou " rolling stone , spin , pitchfork media style writing seems taking over mag . other styles music such blues , country , jazz , etc , pretty much ignored . but like i said , if you're teenager you see it newsstand there song it you would like learn , pick it up , otherwise avoid this magazine	1

you tell title , i'm not enamored this magazine . i've playing video games since early 80s , read many , many gaming magazines . my reasons this negative review gamepro follow no particular order : 1 . ) their numerical rating system stinks . 1-5 points just not accurate enough . most mags/web sites 1-10 system decimals . not gamepro . 2 . ) written part reviews way too short , often written borderline incoherantly . it if they hired proverbial 1,000 monkeys type them out . 3 . ) often times they cram two or three reviews one page . screen shots provided reviews often size postage stamp . 4 . ) number ads relation content distinctly high . once when i bored , i counted all ads one issue . out around 110 pages there 60+ pages ads . 5 . ) their article layouts confusing , occasionally they print colored backgrounds closely match text color . forget reading it if you're colorblind . 6 . ) their gaming tips either so obvious brain dead chimpanzee could figure them out , or plain don't work . i suspect ones ripped off various web sites . 7 . ) gamepro costs same better gaming mags , such egm game informer . so , closing ... if you want good gaming magazine , just any magazine other than gamepro would improvement . many great gaming magazines come gone , why turd like gamepro continues mystery me	-1

i'de never read vibe first place , but i won free years subscription some online contest . i must also mention i'm huge fan hip-hop hip-hop culture , so i'de think vibe would tight ..... daamn , i ever wrong . first off , half mag advertising .... then what little reading there .... it all bullsh ** . interviews they artists totally weak watered down . they never ask any worthwhile questions . vibe also contradicts itself constantly . one issue , they'll give album low rating poor review , then end year they name same album one years best .... what f*** ? vibe it decent moments , but i def . won't paying it anytime soon .	1
where critiques ? articles lack any critical substance . whoever hot moment get their behind kissed . it doesn't matter album usually not worth all hype , vibe go flow . top , there more ads now than ever before . even articles could decent cut down page or so sake saving advertising space .	1

first off , i usually just stick rating critiquing movies . but , every time i see ad this website this time/warner ( or whatever hell company calls itself this week ) rag-mag i start see red . " entertainment weekly " , which once interesting weekly deluge ho-hum everyday life , become just rag crapped out weekly stand newstands week after week prostituting your hard earned cash . back summer 89 , " ew " released after i read few issues , i decided subscribe . i instantly hooked ( new issue would arrive my mailbox saturday before it would hit regular newstands ) i liked getting latest news reviews movies , music , t.v. , video ( later added mid-90 ) . problem magazine started late 90 . i started notice " ew " would cover big movie or event hadn't yet released then following week bash hell out it , or try get some piece dirt it order generate more sales . i also hate damn lists " ew " comes up . latest entitled " top 100 most memorable movie lines " joke . these lists always annoyed me , because i feel they truly not thought out therefore not thought provoking . other most important thing i noticed absolute lack honest review . case point , few weeks ago i picked up latest issue which movie " catwoman " reviewed ( i wasn't sure if it gleiberman or shwarzbaum critiqued it ) . i first logged onto " rotten tomatoes.com " see what percentile " catwoman " recieved nation critics . out roughly 115 reviews " catwoman " only got 10% good reviews while rest trashed it ( film needs , least , get grade 60 - 65% order place it fresh or good movie ) . makes " catwoman " worst reviewed film , so far , 2004 . yet , " ew " gave film . what erkes me even more " catwoman " released " warner bros . " , same company owns rights " harry potter " films , " lord rings " trilogy , yes , " wb " owns " entertainment weekly " . " warner bros . " trying bribe or threaten its own critics one its most popular lucrative magazine ? i'm not only who seen this developement . people written saying there favoritism among " warner " products reviewed magazine . " ew " , course , hotly denies anything kind thumping there chests standing behind there reviews , possibly fear fired ( they deny also ) . my only question reviewers " entertainment weekly " , " whats it like stand your own pile bull**it ? " or better yet , " what it like stand democratic podium ? "	-1
this one many magazines float around school library , it most common . maybe because not too many people read it . all it pure celebrity gossip . there really nothing else here . if you like blurry photos lindsay lohan , donald trump , paris hilton , simon cowell , paula abdul like , ( blurry so you can't see zits flaws ) then you should get this . one article mentioned britney spears stomach , how it coming back . she wearing baggy t-shirt . baggy t-shirts common among women wanting hide gut , not flaunt it . this magazine makes it seem like celebrities lose weight like magic ( they don't-not so far i tell ) . if you want read fact nichole richie acquired yet chloe paddington , fact donald trump thinks his wife melania looks hideous now he gotten her knocked up , or you would like see photos victoria beckham looking pissed off , then read this . this magazine full lies well-for instance , one writer claims young people like lindsay lohan get higher car insurance rates accidents they not fault . false ! you only get higher rates if you fault . this magazine nothing more than overpriced tabloid . there nothing value here . half time insider some anonymous friend , half time facts aren't right . avoid this thing all costs , unless course you celebrity worshipper . i've got better things than worship people who too much money their own good . i'll stick more intelligent fare , thankyouverymuch	-1

this great magazine , but don't order it through amazon . they go through third party ( snapse magazine)that terrible customer service . i ordered this magazine january six months later ... still no magazine . i called snapse twice told they no record order ( even though i received email confirmation amazon i 17 digit confirmation number ) . they said they would research it get back me . no one called or emailed me status , so two weeks later i called them again . they acted if i just placed order told me it takes 6 8 weeks receive first issue . i won't get my first issue until august . buyer beware ... it could take seven months before you receive your first issue .	-1
i am time person year 2003 ( shared title - actively deployed u.s. servicemembers ) . i must say reading time magazine like reading platform democratic party . actually it even worse than it like reading john dean diary , filled more fantasy personal wishes than actual reality . one latest online edition realists taken over washington . give me break . new set hogs come take over troff it . anyone who believes nancy pelosi her gang political hacks going help america fool . best thing we hope they create so much gridlock no one spend any money washington . maybe then they see america improves its own politicians both side make things awful . sad thing people read this publication actually think they walk away knowing something world . this publication so biased it not only misinforms its readers it makes them look like fools when they try repeat what they " learned " . if you want truly useful weekly news publication then subscribe economist . it probably not change your political affiliations but it least make you sound competent when you debate others . economist quite simply best weekly news magazine existence . articles well written people know what they talking . leaders around world read contribute economist . this something time , newsweek rest their ilk cannot claim . i am not affiliated any political parties not consider myself political . i look things economic perspective vote accordingly	-1

i like read cook illustrated library . their magazine much too expensive small amount recipes included within . i like tips sent readers , some product reviews . i found most their recipes very involved -- nitpicky , kind . lemon meringue pie recipe -- which i tried their " america test kitchen " cookbook -- calls cooking cornstarch water , cooling it , then beating solution into meringue . supposedly this keeps meringue destabilizing . all happened my kitchen i found little lumps cornstarch glue bottom my mixing bowl while scraping out meringue . i made meringue before without cornstarch , can't help thinking this extra step isn't neccessary . their " best " brownies good , but i make equally good brownies without all extra steps involved melting chocolate cooling it , etc . if you're looking easy , fool proof recipes , don't take gazillion steps aren't fussy exactly what ingredients you use , this isn't magazine you	1
cook illustrated first cooking magazine i'd found myself truly motivated read cover-to-cover , even though they insert advertisements their own products , which i suppose , them , makes this " ad-free " magazine , but i'm not surprised they've bent rules claim . one time i found it necessary contact cook illustrated customer service issue , i simply floored treatment i received ... i'll simply leave it . i personally don't intend re-subscribing ( " fine cooking " , here i come ! ) . you , however , may find this cooking magazine you . , far what they goes , cook illustrated good what they - i'll give them . if you not found this review helpful , i'm sorry if i haven't made value my warning apparent . just know there those us out there who bad experiences , simply trying prevent others experiencing same .	1

this magazine just page after page hollywood p.r. agencies releases . unbelievable . why didn't i think it ? i know all magazines look editorial content outside sources , but other than few pages very subjective movie/music/book reviews , this magazine just re-writes prints hollywood press release after hollywood press release again again again . this magazine must not staff writers , but must employ army copy editors manning warehouse dedicated fax machines or e-mail inboxes . funniest thing this magazine how first few pages may dedicated typically obsequious press release provided , say , tom cruise management company/major film studio/hired pr flak fawning over cruise or his newest movie - then you turn movie review section where some clever , sassy , wanna-be hipster movie reviewer proceeds tell you movie absolutely sucks . uh , okay - wait , didn't you get press release ? if you tivo extra theme entertainment tonight your ringtone , this magazine right up your alley . otherwise , don't waste penny this nonsense .	-1

oh those days , when i college , reading my first issues then subscribing . there great things found its pages , columns brian crozier , russell kirk , erik von kuenhelt-leddhin ( sp ? ) . great struggle soviet union going into critical stage . it seemed nr so right track . it wonderful read , least 1979 1983 . but then it became while duller . it some periods recrudescence , such under editorship john o'sullivan . but when rich lowry took over nr really began dumb down ( nothing personal mr. lowry ) . but what i've really discovered late how badly neo-con agenda sort taken over magazine . we've got 50th anniversary issue call midge dector rally country our illegal immoral war iraq . really something happened magazine , sinister force entrenched itself there . what force ? well , go come-and-hear.com you begin learn part picture , especially when you read material elizabeth dilling . i would also recommend paul findley they dare speak out , which details israeli lobby domination our congress . nr once courageous conservative magazine , but now it heavily tainted influence terrible thing . wfb should know better , maybe he . if he doesn't , then he should pick up neo-conned ! neo-conned again !, then he should listen tony martin talk given ihr certain group tactics deployed suppress free speech . what inspired me write this review wfb recent column incarceration david irving . it ends disgusting gloating . wfb fallen into evil trap , so magazine he used run . what happened christian faith people like buckley ? he now seems lost terribly afraid offending supposedly saintly interest group ... you , mr. lowry , come now : read widely deeply don't afraid reading talmud israeli lobby . once you , maybe you'll develop strength think outside box . we're going if we want anything but bleakest future mankind planet .	1

legend goes there time few decades ago when " gramophone " unquestioned authority reviews recordings classical music . whether or not legend true ( i'm too young know ) , gramophone time definitely passed . today there multitude sources free information classical music internet , newsgroups websites . some it less well-informed than gramophone criticism , but some it more well-informed . what undeniable , price few mouse-clicks , it possible find far greater range reviews recordings internet than gramophone ( its british-based critics ) offer . what more , gramophone tied business-model classical music industry fast becoming obsolete . historically , most important classical recordings issued few so-called " major " companies such emi , deutsche grammophon cbs ( later sony ) . these " majors " would buy lavish advertising spreads gramophone so finance magazine . return , gramophone would devote lengthy reviews majors ' new releases would produce pages fluffy interviews musicians under contract majors . today situation different . most interesting new release more likely appear mp3 obscure russian website than new cd sony . small companies , dedicated solely classical music recordings , produce great results shoestring budgets while " major " corporations virtually abandoned new classical recordings . this development causes problems gramophone business model . new players classical music industry don't publicity budgets fund glossy magazine like gramophone through advertising . gramophone implicit bargain : " advertise us or we won't review your recordings " , magazine seems becoming more more irrelevant . if you want subscribe classical music periodical , i recommend " international record review " or " fanfare " . both offer substantially more reviews per month than gramophone . but most all , i suggest checking out huge range classical music information available free web usenet	1

my family received this magazine years , but recently we decided not re-new our subscription . this used quality product but it recently gone downhill inclusion more more advertising each issue . this point , nearly half magazine consists advertisements -- this isn't real science magazine it claims , waste money . content not all great . articles often extremely short , too short even pre-teen audience . my kids often wished this magazine included more serious science topics , not just shortened , dumbed-down material . much magazine full " fluff " -- things like word searches picture matching games , which didn't interest my children . content might okay 7-8 year olds children slightly lower reading levels , but older children bored . all all , i'd recommend you simply get regular , adult version national geographic . though articles might too complex children , pictures make up what they can't read . if you're looking more children's-oriented magazine , you're better off muse , high quality general science magazine published smithsonian museum washington , dc . however , muse caters slightly older audience , perhaps ages 9 up .	1

i found this magazine helpful introduction advanced computing . that it . this mag seems biased towards certain products amp ; manufacturers . they neglected open my eyes wider . reviews/articles published seem favor big money companies ( microsoft , dell , etc ) . they don't give credit smaller , better , less-well-known companies technologies . all info pretty basic intro users , but if that what you interested ... then this great non-comlicated publication	1
thing i hate this magazine letters editor section . supposedly , they're written real people . but after reading this magazine last few years , these letters all seem same maudlin , soporific , sappy style prose reads me like they've edited way . there this condescending " athletes supposed behave like good ladies gentlemen if they don't , then tsk tsk - what children think ?

i would like classify myself moderate but i probably lean conservative . because , i subscribed harpers so i could read good writing would challenge my beliefs stretch my mind new ways . i got , more or less , first , but over course couple years magazine drifted further further leftist propaganda screed , worst which louis lapham bitter drivel editorials . it got point where writing incredibly predictable ; i knew exactly what position ( read : left pelosi ) writer -- any writer harpers -- would take whatever issue , i pretty good idea what line whining would . if you attend dinner parties upper east side ; if you drive prius oscars ; if you think commercial organic farming environmental travesty ; if you've ever desecrated starbucks , then look no more -- this magazine you . however , if you're dumbfounded how republicans keep winning elections -- then you realize they democratic party opponents ; if you realize genius george bush karl rove getting liberals underestimate george bush karl rove ; if you want read smart , insightful writing inform entertain , then try atlantic monthly ( which , way , i am surprised see reviewers describe liberal magazine ; i think it moderate , if anything , bit conservative side . ) needless say , i let my harpers subscription lapse . two stars , tho , harper index -- however , wasn't worth price subscription ( it got only thing worth anything price subscription ) .	1

i've watching this magazine slide downhill some time , but they've finally hit bottom . bulk april 25 2006 magazine devoted cars . yes , todays automobiles becoming highly computerized , but magazine supposed highlight software hardware we use our desktops . pc mag drifting far afield , doing articles apple computers , gaming systems , extensive reviews cameras . instead pcs , subject seems anything computer chip it , or some way remotely related computers . obvious inference there nothing interesting going pc world , so they keep stretching just fill pages . i find hard believe ; i think it more likely staff lost their focus , or they've hired people who not interested or qualified write pcs . lack pertinent content makes dwindling size magazine even more apparent . what used rival small phone book now size time magazine . they now " new look " , it awful . their readership used consist well educated , technically sophisticated professionals . these people don't need dozen arrows pointing into every photograph , cutesy " handwritten " notes belaboring obvious . that more appropriate folks who hard time getting through high school short attention spans . compare this issue issues couple years ago , it obvious they've " dumbed down " entire magazine . i've subscribed pc magazine years , considered it " must read " keep up rapidly evolving hardware software pc world . but no more -- it time find one something useful write subject personal computers .	-1
you tell title , i'm not enamored this magazine . i've playing video games since early 80s , read many , many gaming magazines . my reasons this negative review gamepro follow no particular order : 1 . ) their numerical rating system stinks . 1-5 points just not accurate enough . most mags/web sites 1-10 system decimals . not gamepro . 2 . ) written part reviews way too short , often written borderline incoherantly . it if they hired proverbial 1,000 monkeys type them out . 3 . ) often times they cram two or three reviews one page . screen shots provided reviews often size postage stamp . 4 . ) number ads relation content distinctly high . once when i bored , i counted all ads one issue . out around 110 pages there 60+ pages ads . 5 . ) their article layouts confusing , occasionally they print colored backgrounds closely match text color . forget reading it if you're colorblind . 6 . ) their gaming tips either so obvious brain dead chimpanzee could figure them out , or plain don't work . i suspect ones ripped off various web sites . 7 . ) gamepro costs same better gaming mags , such egm game informer . so , closing ... if you want good gaming magazine , just any magazine other than gamepro would improvement . many great gaming magazines come gone , why turd like gamepro continues mystery me	-1

i decided i write review newsweek this morning , after i came across yet biased , over-hyped cover story . this particular one entitled , " rethinking marriage crunch , " goes back everything they presented 20 years ago woman chances getting married later life . this undoubtedly very easy them they probably no evidence their assertion first time around , neglected any this occasion . i really think reviewer comparison people quite apt , but newsweek also provides reliably pro-sexual revolution pro-sixties counter-culture take almost every issue . two years ago , we made privy bit front page sensationalism concerning " infidelity chic . " yes , it seems , according their sources , spousal cheating all rage even though they argue , without even hint contradiction , everybody still wants get married much ever before . i find magazine [ ... ] they offer opinion instead news ; theirs mission persuasion . overall , there little which recommend this publication it geared readership trivial people who possess depth kiddy pool .	1
psychology today purports deliver latest trends psychological studies layman , but what it really delivers pop psychology whole lot advertisements . i give magazine one star very snazzy layout , second star hiring writers don't insult reader intelligence abusing alliteration ( unlike magazine supposedly aimed intelligent adults ) . however , content consistently concerned more pop culture than lives real people . i also noticed bias against introverts article after article attacks shyness serious character defect , rather than simply personality trait ( so , introverts , if you want avoid yet lecture how your way relating world intrinsically wrong , avoid this rag )	1
this definitely inferior rag big trio science monthlies . filled poorly-written articles . i actually went back home depot once get refund this magazine . it indeed worth gas time get refund if you actually pay this magazine . this magazine promotes commercial products , no i'm not talking advertisements , but actual articles themselves . magazine not news magazine , it just one big advertising rag where manufacturers paid get . if you like paying ads , go it	1
i'm sure this review isn't unique . spin rotates same ten bands its cover , not mention ridiculous articles written within . time they get describing ' euro-punk-indie-pop artist just slammed them face their way train station their jazzed up sound ' i've completely forgotten point thier article . they must greatest time just sitting around finding how many contradictory adjectives they tag onto useless music still manage say nothing . they sound like cyber-nerds who need get out little more stop getting thier info mtv.com . i'm sure i've learned more what thier editors office any given day than anything remotely close music while reading spin . next time you see it stands , i suggest you spin direction	-1
why ? because it underestimates our intelligence ! it nothing natural health . it advertisements . it empty , completelly . more : it looks like woman magazine but i believe clever woman would feel like i feel now , angry ! i paid something i believed but it not . ok , we make mistakes	-1
nice cover pictures headlines , but way too many ads . there reason its only twelve bucks , this ad-sponsored mag	1
this definitely magazine gearheads . it pretty much just equipment reviews advertisements . i would given it higher rating but two things : 1 ) i don't think i've ever seen popular photography not love any piece equipment . reviews still useful if you're just wondering what features new gizmo , but still , they ought bit more critical if they're going such review based magazine . 2 ) many ads vendors bad reputations . i believe they make some sort claim requiring certain level honesty anyone they sell ad space , but it sure doesn't look like they ever kicked anyone out magazine me . so what you when you magazine full uncritical reviews , occasional beginnerish article technique , lot ads stores dubious virtue ? best 2 star magazine	1

i told this magazine good look design ideas . it isn't really , there isn't really much this magazine . it just tired old aoltimewarner publication , just like time , people , or teen people . i looked august september issues only things those two impressed me features elton john out africa fundraiser article julian mcmahon . rest it ads , not classy type ads make advertising tolerable vogue magazine , but same old ads you'll see anywhere else , they annoying . there several nonsense fashion articles likes kelly ripa ( post excessive photoshop airbrushing tools-one my professors would call it " plastic person syndrome " ) mark consuelos , waay too much jennifer garner her baby , other weird things , such trend designer cupcakes . i wish i kidding latter , but i am not , nor i $25 spend glorified cupcake just because it jessica alba favorite . there entirely too much dress/act/eat/shop/play this way because stars it way here . despite size this magazine , there very little sink ones teeth into , just way too many photos same old same old , tips mimicking them . i am not interested becoming teri hatcher clone , nor am i interested seeing vanessa carlton pad . this magazine you if you like excessive ads , no diversity , subscription actually not year ( it says special issues count regular issues magazine ) your life ambition try cupcake bakery new york because some celebrity . this magazine mediocre best , worst part , it exact same fashion advice vogue . i went vogue because there substance their magazine , ads classy very chic . leave this one behind-it looks me like brain fluff read folks aol time warner .	1
i subscribed bhg their website ended up subscribing additional year . articles helpful degree but layout this magazine , its overwhelming amount advertising , takes away any good points . i've found style choppy very difficult read because ads . it hard tell how long article or where it starts . i rarely find anything i'd want save . overall disappointment	1
i started reciving vibe magazine mail announced unexpected . this wouldn't first time this happened , turns out my grandmother bought me people magazine gift copies sent my house . i figured somebody got me this magazine gift . next thing i know charge magazine appears my bank statement . i called vibe immediately asked them what happened . they told me there nothing they could their company didn't directly deal payment issues subscription services . they gave me toll free number i too call outside company handled payments . when i called this company , it completely automated service , could not speak actual person regardless what extension i used . i eventually go down my bank find out what i could . turns out vibe illegally gained my bank account number charging me months , but i only just recently started recieve magazine . i close down my checking account open up new one , which resulted me charged my gym other other companies access my account order subtract monthly bills . it if i written them bad check , something i never my life now greatly questioned my credibility . please not support these people , they theives top magazine terrible uncredible . i seriously hope my review help deter any all people subscribing this magazine	-1

i reading this magazine work , i consider it trashy magazine . it only focuses sexual part women , like if sex best thing world , because they this article which girl riding taxi , she thought taxi guy fine , so she unbutton her shirt told taxi guy touch her breasts . then she says it * best experience she ever . i just cant believe they publish garbage like , giving message women its ok undress yourself total stranger , who you dont even know . i prefer read things focus more inner heart , emotional , spiritual side things . read books help me better person right now future , throw away garbage this society	-1
great magazine but beware subscriptions . my subscription paid back august ' 06 i yet see copy ( january ' 07 ) . their customer service assured me twice they would send out my magazines but nothing ever arrives . plus , phone number they provided not service ! its shame because magazine looks really well	-1
i subscribed hobby farm after reading two issues i cancelled it . i read article march/april issue show birds . then , i got my may/june issue . don schrider , communication director albc , wrote correct story . article claimed " over 1000 " birds show , correction 11,640 birds present . other correction regarding earlobe color egg shell color stating there exceptions red earlobe/ brown eggs white earlobes/white eggs . mar/apr issue i read article guinea hens . may/june issue i read letter reader ( dana manchester member guinea fowl breeders assoc . ) correcting article previous issue . apparently , guineas aren't " watch fowl " they portrayed , but fall victim predation often . dana manchester also corrected mislabeled photos guineas . these may small errors but how goods resource isn't reliable ? if errors only issues , i may given mag 3 stars but article manure management may/june issue lacking many levels . advise nutshell buy manure spreader you pull around your field , fill'er up drive . one word caution according article- only use well rotted manure garden , but there wasn't one word how rot manure . i liked article smaller breeds cattle , " bigger not better " may/june but we'll wait next issue see if any readers step forward corrections . i am not waiting around . there lot books magazines dedicated small farms . i like mother nature news i just subscribed countryside ( my nephew recommended it he owns small farm , well ) . i also like john seymour book self-sufficient life how live it . he upbeat attitude can-do spirit .	1

i , repeat reading this magazine ten years or so . over time they really changed . i guess it started when they got new editor four or five years ago . after adds changed building suppliers lexus ads . i don't like seeing automotive home stereo ads my how-to magazine . information more akin martha stewart than it norm abrams . who way hardly there anymore if all . not mention new guy , stray they picked up ask this old house , what opie taylor he . what makes him eligible write something toh magazine . i really miss steve thomas . how-to though somewhat informative really lack intricate details . all i say thank god tom silva still puts some minutia his wealth information . if you'd like " better homes gardens plus magazine " then this magazines you if you want learn something try fine homebuilding or least family handyman	1

don't get me wrong .. i love two hard cover books , real simple solutions real simple : guide organized living . they gems . however , magazine simply betrays it words . one rater stated , it seems like reader cajoled into buying un-needed expensive products , my god .. magazine cluttered ads inserts , plus it very hard turn pages read . i realize ads necessary , but this extreme , especially magazine supposedly promotes less complicated cluttered life it readers	1
it almost if this magazine writes it stories 2 mounths advance onces you get " latest " copy it news repeated 7961 , 583 times . it however decent posters ( that why it got 2 not just 1 ) but thats only thing this magazine offer .	1
knitters take note : i purchased what titled " anna : burda knitting needlecrafts-english ed " . what arrived " anna needlework crafts , " which contains very little knitting . i should looked photo magazine cover ad , which displays needlework crafts cover . since i can't find magazine conveniently my north mississippi area i'll shell out 50 bucks order publisher , i guess .	-1
after ordering this magazine it sems i've got gardening membership , which okay i guess , but now i've got some book sitting my office i preview 10 days decide keep low low cost only ..... you get picture . all i wanted gardening magazine . if i wanted join book club or gardening club than i would . i really feel like i decieved discription this magazine now i get joyful fun returning items i don't want or getting charged them . yeah !	1
this magazine published same people brought us maxim . so if you like maxim , check it out . if you don't: pass . pictures slick , models attractive , but there little way information how it yourself or what actually bike . it basically picture book . if you looking technical articles , how tos or performance installs ; check out road bike metrics or hot bike or american iron harleys victory 	1

we subscription this magazine it pretty good one kids , albeit woefully thin . i found it too expensive few pages magazine not renew it . after ignoring standard renewal pleas , yesterday i found my mailbox letter ( subscription invoice attached , course ) stating my account " seriously past due " " further action pending " my " delinquent " account . those getting similar notices , i found this number call : 1-800-825-2821the lady i spoke said she cancelled ' unathorized order ' ... we shall see if i receive any other notices . it really shame tactics subscription services overshadow actual product	-1
i am not alone here when i say knit ' style joke most knitters . myself my knitting friends agree it evidence someone , somewhere , seriously deluded if they think these patterns what average knitter yearning make . i can't help but believe if you can't get published worthwhile knitting magazine then you go knit ' style . because , seriously , they'll take anything try sell it poor unsuspecting knitters . save yourself money flip through this magazine if you see it shelf somewhere . you may get lucky find one pattern that worth making single issue ... but then again , you may not . i suggest interweave knits , family circle easy knits , or vogue knitting if you want patterns you'll actually want wear .	-1
i two three years knit style ( 2001 - 2003)magazines , lately spent lot time looking through them cardigan pattern knit myself . i haven't found single one . all patterns serious faults : drop shoulders , ( totally unacceptable ) little or no armhole , neck and/or shoulder shaping . most sleeves little or no cap . , worst all , they all made five or more pieces . haven't any these quot ; designersquot ; heard elizabeth zimmerman ? i going give lot library , but am wondering if perhaps trash might better place . if you trying attract new knitters among younger people , why don't you teach them proper way knit ? young people smarter than you think	-1
we subscribed this magazine , part due special offer 12 free cycling booklets road log each new subscription . what we get ? note letting us know unfortunately " gift described promotion no longer available " " rather than keep us waiting , ( they've ) taken liberty sending enclosed substitute ...

so i'm mostly other folks content . if you get lucky , small sampling product reviews include some item you're looking ( or should ) , anemic review prompt you follow up manufacturers website . " buyer guide " decent breadth useless depth bikes . no bikes gary fisher , inventor mountain biking . huh ? i'm primarily interested mtb issues mountain bike good . but , you only get 4 issues , content redundant two magazines ( or even within each mag ) . instance , may mtb issue story rebuilding trails los alamos ( i actually really like their reviews specific places ) , cover also boasted " great american trail guide . " one four trails talked this " great american .. guide " : los alamos . i spot cut paste job when i see one . also issue " bike started revolution " sp stumpjumper . great idea interesting article butchered into condescending comic strip . also , ordered mag issues mtb , i disappointed when they didn't even show up . emails customer service resulted one more disappointing " you not read my email " type exchanges . two months later , i now one two missing issues hand . they great photography , i yet find better option , but i'm really disappointed . i won't renew	1

unless you want editor liberal political views shoved down your throat , avoid this magazine . it leans left so hard you lie your side even read it . ( no , i am not republican or democrat , but independent who looks all sides ) . editor this magazine huge agenda get democrats back power , he bashes bush republican party over head 10-ton hammer monthly basis , yet worships eco-phonies like laurie david celebrities who want rest us drive eco-friendly cars while they fly world their private jets . ( i understand laurie her friends like sheryl crow " trying " wean themselves off this practice cutting down their private jet hopping trips wee bit using huge gas guzzling bus criss-crossing country instead , but poor laurie finding this hard give up . what hyprocrites these hollywood folks ! ) though i am personally trying my bit environment , i hate when i read issues like current " green " issue where these so called eco-environmentalists really only want us " common people " make changes . this used great fashion , entertainment current event magazine lot in-depth articles , but now it only political platform publication . i now just throw it away soon it arrives when i receive it , until my subscription expires	-1

i paid too much amazon . subscription would significantly less expensive straight magazine . i learned my lesson	1
cooking pleasures magazine magazine produced cooking club america . i very happily joined cooking club america , began receiving this magazine quite while ago . club offers so much its subscribers , but time wore , i could see marketing department tad too aggressive my taste . cooking club america offers their potential members numerous items entice them join . members take part member-only contests where kitchen products gift baskets some prizes . they sent food items or kitchen products review . they also receive cheese grater joining ! there some nice photographs this publication . recipes not complicated either , although they require some unusual ingredients some very expensive many people would find hard locate . i , personally , forego some recipes , others ; i order couple ingredients online , because reasons given . cheese grater sent you nice idea , but it rotary grater , you squeeze very hard get cheese grate . also , grater made plastic eventually snaps half after using it only handful times . club also offers you culinary resource directory . information contained this directory not difficult find basic internet search . you also receive standard sized blank recipe cards . unfortunately , due size recipe cards , i not believe anyone even write ingredients onto them without running out space . also , part member benefits sample products review . potential members see photographs blenders , ice cream makers much more . while member there three years , i opportunity review quick rise yeast chipotle spice . both nice products . they not glamorous photos kitchen appliances , but it something ! currently , they offering visa credit card their logo . this card , not only you use card like any other credit card , but also you receive club discounts . if this something appeals you , see club details . approximately 3 months after you renew your own subscription , they start mailing you how you should renew your membership following year now , so you help them keep club costs down . after just paying current year , i not interested paying year already . idea may not contact members so soon after they just paid their subscriptions . may save club some money . i caller id , i utilize it all time , screening my calls specifically avoid telemarketing calls . imagine my surprise when i pick up call it representative cooking club america . i , actually , pleasantly surprised , thinking i embark benefit member . i most disappointed hear mono-toned voice other end line , reading script , suggesting i become lifetime member now . when i tell them i am not interested , they " new " deal me . when i still tell them i am not interested , they yet deal . calls continued after this conversation couple months . this point , my subscription expired . i relieved telemarketing phone call really turned me off . you should there see me receive my credit card statement . cooking club america automatically charged my credit card my next subscription without my permission . it three months after my original subscription expired ! you imagine , this extremely upsetting . upon doing my research this article , i come find others similar experiences this magazine . it shame too , this magazine plenty potential . unfortunately , their marketing department could utilize different tactics maintaining their current membership . despite this magazine very affordable , i recommend you save your money this one try fine cooking , cuisine home or cook illustrated . not only these magazines provide better recipes , more professional tips , they also not call you daily get your money	-1

i used love light tasty , then they decided change look format , even though reader surveys said keep it same . new look hard read , lacks down-home feel makes magazines popular . there less pictures finished dishes , pictures they show smaller . they added full page ads thier country store products , which goes against no ad promise . i subscribed years , but this new look horrible . get it store see if you like it first	1

what it these gossip magazines ?? please tell me , because i truly think no one their right mind would ever subscribe this garbage . all it mindless crap media puts into kids minds , while not anything important else magazine . unless your 10 years old , not subscribe this . there better magazines out there fortunately , like seventeen cosmogirl ! which aren't nearly filled garbage like this . reason you don't see j-14 or this magazine or any other magazine like this top magazine list because it no effect people , it little kids it not mature . period .	-1
i must say i've read just every teen magazine market , this far worst one i've ever read . however , this point my life , everything appears superficial immature . i first picked up twist when it debuted newsstands . i believe august 1997 . i nine then , looking fashion forward among my girlfriends who still into jungle gym . because my insane desire cool , because twist wasn't too hard me understand , i loved it bought it religiously year . my obsession it slowly faded magazine got progressively worse i didn't pick it up again ...... until my junior year high school . looking through then-current issue magazine , i noticed way which it written made comprehensible nine year-old , or lowest common denomination older teenage readers . what i'm trying say this magazine totally dumbed-down . it doesn't give girls any credit able think creatively , let alone read above fourth-grade level . i also found content more childish superficial than other teen magazines ( although they all superficial extent - doesn't mean they don't make delightfully fun entertaining reading share friends ) . therefore , i recommend this magazine tweens ( 9-13 ) , tweens only . but even they better than this magazine . older readers should check out somewhat more sophisticated ' elle girl ' or ' cosmo girl ' , my two personal favorite s.p.s. i agree one other reviewers who pointed out numerous spelling errors magazine . possibly my biggest caveat constant misuse apostrophe ( i.e. tuesday instead tuesdays ) .	-1
i received this magazine gift ... i not renew . articles very short refer you websites , telephone numbers , etc . more information . why so little information magazine itself ? additionally , there load advertising : take out equation magazine would only few pages long . my money , there much more available elsewhere , including " google " search . waste paper , imho	-1

only reason i subscribe i found free subscription somewhere . magazine some interesting articles but most time they just completely wrong . one example preview last years nfl draft . they talked up terrell suggs long article point he definetely going latest third even quaterback needy bengals lions who really wanted rogers finding it hard take pass him . where he end up ? going baltimore ravens . not even his homestate team cardinals wanted him . example cover their college football preview . they picked auburn their national champions . i don't follow college football enough understand , but i know auburn lost its first two games doesn't look much like team vying national championship . i'm not saying sports illustrated perfect their picks always accurate , but they seem me get better grasp sports . yes sports illustrated ads , but looking through my last issue it doesn't seem sporting news any less . it takes while till you get least two consecutive non ad pages . it seems like they both same amount . even if one more ads than others it hard really turn page ? you lazy ? articles important thing not many people say ones sporting news better . i'd like hear what some people thought so nonsports related sports illustrated . i personally haven't seen anything non sports relat1ed . yes they reviews occasional sports themed book movie but they usually short just letting fans know whether its worth it	-1

christmas 2005 i decided i wanted most interesting best cooking magazines out there . but which ones pick ? after buying one here there i found three i absolutely love . saveur one . recipes nice though some i wouldn't touch ten foot pole ( ethnic ingredients don't appeal me ) . but stories pictures ... they aren't just amazing , they're astounding ! where national geographic talks certain things or places , saveur takes you different places shows you what there how they eat . they showed me ireland i even made colcannon ( mashed potato cabbage dish ) everyone loved it . i made french dish last night amazing . it little time consuming but worth it ! i admit i little disappointed my first issue i received them my subscription . it looked like dog ate it then ran through water it . it readable but i wasn't happy . they also promise two exclusive magazines new subscribers . i've never seen them . but i getting my magazines they look good . i thinking it other night , my three magazines i picked ... one articles recipes healthy eating ( eating well ) , one easier recipes no articles ( everyday food ) , then saveur . if i could only pick one keep ... it would saveur . it really good read .	1
you bet , this one . there only few mac oriented magazines out there they all wish they could this well written . this large format magazine each issue filled series how-to articles i consider best written , best illustrated easiest follow . i slog through some fairly dull reading but this magazine i would give my wife / daughter / co-worker explain how use ichat , hook up isight camera , customize ical , get started safari so . they review many new software tittles latest hardware goodies . since it magazine , reviews very current . each issue comes cd they starting include pdf copies prior issues , great reference	1
it true entrepreneur mag loaded ads -- but those ads interesting themselves . i always find it fascinating see what ads pop what ads junk -- it easy see difference . this opportunity develop your own advertising strategy ! content , there certainly room improvement . i personally enjoy entrepreneur profiles , though i wish they longer . i would like see more meat here . business several years now , i find most value this magazine comes front section where they list interesting tips , new products , survey results . not month goes i don't bookmark page so i follow up new product or check out website mentioned short piece . alone , low subscription price worth investmen t.t here lot information franchising , which great those interested this business model . though this not my personal cup tea , i still find it interesting read lists franchises notice trends popularity . who knew there so many pet service franchises available ! sure , it could use more real-world advice , but i still consider this one best general magazines available entrepreneurs . not every topic appeal every reader since we all run different kinds businesses seek different information . if you're looking something more specific your industry , trade magazine would make more sense . but i still recommend you keep your entrepreneur mag too so you keep eye climate small biz world .	1
i thought my first issue your magazine little sparse . it very thin issue . models beautiful . this good . but you knowif you would include more depth articlessuch really depth stuff skin hair . like i said before aging skin needs more it some things like micro-dermabrasion could helpful . also 8 glasses water day most helpful thing woman could herself . beside plastic surgery , theres not much them . but i saythis , enlarge lips i put vitamin capsule my lips , then honey then good lip moisturizer leave it overnight . it doees make lips plumper . also i use baby powder my face face powder . sometimes i use this just my nose chin . sometimes i use half mayonaise conditioner mix them together make mayonaise smell better hair . sometimes i use vitamin oil my bath water such vitamin person buy this dollar store . im not rich but i some things help way i look my age . then you could include pictures mountains rivers stories people . then you could articles celebrities like frank converse , robert blake , really interesting ones like . paul newman always got something say interesting . also what ever happened actor richard hatch who starred hitchhikers ? someone told me other day most handsome actor there or yul brynner . i didnt see i should . i dont know if you agree or not but it would interesting see profile way he lived . i like brad pitt those people always great . i love jennifer anniston because she she higher up than most women her thoughts actions . angelina jolie i really like too beacause women like these women . i miss johnny carson they really need find someone replace him . yes there people like still world . ive found some them . well thank you	1

i've subscribing paste over year now , it great magazine . i agree what others said writing : interviewers often seem love their subjects deal musicians fans instead journalists . there tons reviews each issue wide variety bands music , sampler cd dvd worth subscription price all themselves . it great way listen bands you would never heard otherwise . if you love music spending small fortune cds , this magazine you . my only real criticism magazine it very text heavy , tons small print jammed onto each page , often background picture/design behind words , which makes it chore read . i would love see larger print less eye junk pages . then again , i'm closing 40 so younger eyes may not find it problematic	1

i heard this magazine even before i came this country it never disappointed me ever since i subscribed it . i valued it most among other photography magazines i subscribed . reason i find this magazine quot ; real stuffquot ; . equipment , it detailed objective test . articles not just obscure evaluation u find elsewhere , instance , it once said : quot ; ... based our field lab test , this amateur lens gives better performance than its professional counterpart ... quot ; , whereas other magazines , what u find probably quot ; this lens good , one nice ... quot ; . photo tips , it more insightful than just quot ; sunny 16quot ; or quot ; always use tripodquot ; . u find photographer own consideration why put composition this way but not . all , i think this magazine anyone who interested photography begin continue wit	1
when i little , my dad always said good things this magazine . my attitude always quot;i'm not gonna buy magazine bore myself some morequot ; - i mean , c'mon , it history magazine . i absolutely wrong . i picked up this magazine one day i hooked . i would say american heritage found its way make history interesting . one way it this somehow weave issues current interest ( subtle they may ) into its articles . second thought , i should listened my dad beginning - he anesthesiologist - he knows what put people sleep what not . this magazine keeps me awake - sometimes i would put my paper/project aside just so i could finish my copy one sitting . it unfortunate this magazine only comes out every two months . american heritage makes history grrreattt ! ... even non-history buff his early 20 like myself	1
world gaming , there specialized magazines each system ( playstation magazine , xbox mag , etc . ) , most which suck because they only report ( duh ) games their respective systems . others , like electronic gaming monthly , encompass most systems but only it half-assed , not really giving you anything make you think highly it . then , there gameinformer . there many things set gameinformer apart many other " gaming " magazines : 1 ) they completely unbiased opinions games they play . if game sucks , they say so ; if it awesome game , they'll tell you it . 2 ) matt helgeson ( senior gaming editor ) other editors actually inform you game most necessary attributes : its esrb rating ( ) , their rating game ( 1 10 ) , brief introduction game faults successes . best all , however , they include screenshots game- most screenshots rock . these just some reasons gameinformer magazine absolute best gaming magazine market . i subscription this magazine this magazine only , i hope my review explained why .	1
i used read online content this magazine ( i still check out blog ) , but i say there even more content magazine than there online , it really worth subscribing . articles well written usually change my mind issues i may not realized i mind change . i would recommend this magazine anyone	1
i subscribed details because i'm interested male psyche . i also like looking male celebrity pictures guy models ads . its not most politically correct article planet , one last page called " gay or ...? " which writer tries uncover if certain type person gay or not , no conclusion actually ever given so i suppose its reader decide . its very stereotypical part magazine , but beyond there cool articles read male perspectives . i also enjoy reading celebrity interviews , addition they include interviews female celebrities . i don't agree everything printed here , but certain articles made me think i've actually gotten lot out it . it helps me understand guys i agree certain opinions . mag leans toward liberal unabashed its attitude so . i like it lot , it may not everyone that fine .	1
man this it , great mag cool business people . what you not know , you after reading all this great info . read !!	1
i've subscriber over fifteen years , probably continue subscribe until day i die . but times i find national geographic frustrating . i no interest soccer , nor i want huge fold-out map discussing sport . aren't there more phenomenal things going world today ? also , geographic its pet topics . how many articles must we read pandas ? dozen ? i like pandas , believe me , but surely there other less cute animals discuss . also i could without lectures pc environmental propaganda . articles oil-drilling alaska filled thinly veiled agenda which preachy annoying . yeah , we get it , you don't want alaska drilled . we move , please ? other articles quite interesting . i enjoy zip code discussion , old-fashioned pictures , articles countries . i could fewer articles underwater archaeology though , articles filled preachy environmentalist scolding gets boring . friend mine ( joe average type guy ) , said he stopped subscribing geographic because articles depressing him . i tried argue him , because i think magazine great- but i kind agree , topics late downbeat aren't particularly uplifting . i believe magazine getting little ' out there ' its choice topics , too . i recommend this magazine those interested environment world around them	1
this excellent magazine . there very few magazines i choose read cover cover . this one few . photographs illustrate text accompany it just right . they gorgeous . writing clear concise interesting . topics they write include history , travel , historical objects , animals , places so . one monthly article fast become my favorite photographers . each month they highlight famous picture photographer who took it discuss what made picture important . they tell little bit photographer person who photographed ( if it person ) . this fascinating magazine well worth money . enjoy .	1
big 3 ( fortune , forbes , businessweek ) , i like fortune most . businessweek feels like it always copying someone or dying jump bandwagon next big thing . forbes good magazine but sometimes so original it veers too far its original purpose --- report analyze business world . fortune profiles people it chooses writes current events without just summarizing way businessweek	1

i scrapbooking more than five years , i my style rather simple . however , i recently found myself rut , i began wishing i could fancier pages , so i began receiving creating keepsakes . although i still no desire two page spread takes 5+ hours , this magazine great inspiring me try new things , well just giving me ideas both scrapbooking stamping , just first three issues my subscription . they fairly good job showing expensive way page , well more economical . additionally , there product reviews recommendations . i typically buy most my supplies at-home parties , i found very helpful recommendation silent eyelet setter . some their articles geared towards more advanced/ambitious scrapbooker . instance , recent article explained how use certain computer programs augment photos . results beautiful , but this just not up my alley . they also recently spread scrapooking rooms some their staff , i very , very jealous ! i may never any award-winning spreads , i probably never use my computer augment my pictures , but i know my scrapbooking more creative better looking due this magazine	1
yes , ew changed over years , but i believe it relevent now it ever . articles interesting reviews usually right mark . i read it cover cover .	1
what i like this magazine articles unique informative . i bought last three issues can't wait next one . this magazine covers equipment current mode rather than 6 months year behind style so familiar many other photography magazines . this magazine provides me some much needed diversion because it captures my attention each time i picked one up . every article telling me or showing me how implement lastest techniques best photographers industry . beginning this year i noticed some " popular " or " modern " " digital review " magazines running same old head head comparisons consumer cameras out better part year now . i need see technology cutting edge or even around corner . so far this magazine giving me best bang my buck . good luck	1
here magazine focuses modern design clean-line architecture without trendy vibe makes competitor like " wallpaper " expensive , hit-or-miss read . what i like most " dwell " its consistency presenting interesting designs around world look quite livable fashionable same time . even advertisements quite compatible flow magazine , so much so they often look like they part editorial . there very useful " marketplace " section end tells you where get lot art , furniture accessories complementary designs presented . i often used these helpful listings find some interesting things my own place . this magazine definitely geared toward urban loft dweller , but i like how they highlight homes families mind well . individual issues often focused either geographic or utility-related themes , thus keeping library mandatory future reference . photography superb . if you tired design magazines seem talking specifically designers , this great , reasonably priced alternative people who simply appreciate great design . highly recommended	1

i subscribing this mag couple years , think it one best gaming mags available . i several different consoles , appreciate they review games all platforms . i like rating system ( 1-10 ) instead too-hard-to-pin-down 1-5 , find reviews well written objective . while i gaming years , i am not necessarily versed computer lingo , but i never feel like idiot after reading this mag ; writing erudite but very easy understand . i read several different gaming magazines each month , feel this magazine strikes exactly right balance more serious more frivolous gaming magazines industry . one suggestion : if you gamestop or affiliated store your neighborhood , get your subscription through them . $15 you receive 12-year subscription , card gives you 10% off used games these stores , well extra 10% trade-in value your used games ( sometimes there coupon month mag upgrade 20% both ! ) .	1
car driver multi-purpose auto magazine . it hybrid magazines like road track , which focus exotic extreme auto world , magazines like motor trend , which focus more practical . magazine always fun , intereseting read , keeps you up date teh auto world . i must , however , say , it not good job rating cars motor trend , it doesn't quite coverage exotics road track ( definitely falls short road track superb photography . )	1
i first came across taste home magazine 10 years ago . some friends mine quite experimental couple who loved try out new recipes . recipient tasty appetizers , dips , desserts , i asked them recipes . it then they shared this magazine me ... i've subscriber ever since ! each magazine features several special features , well mainstay departments such potluck pleasers , my mom best meal , getting theme things , super snacks appetizers . arguably best part this magazine their clip-and-keep section recipes which feature color photos dish . just cut out recipe , ouila ! it ready your recipe box . other information-packed sections include ask our food editor , touring country kitchens , ted toothpick contest , lively leftovers , more . each issue also features recipe contest win cold , hard cash . some great recipes most recent issue include : swiss-stuffed porkchopsopen-faced turkey tacosspinach shrimp fettuccinecoffee ' ' cream browniescucumber potato saladasparagus chicken crepeshearty jambalayabarvarian strawberry pieand many more . besides tasty dishes , one great things recipes taste home they don't call some exotic ingredients . rather , they feature ingredients found any department store ... even if you live out-of-the-way rural area ! some recipes aren't exactly " quick " , which why i give it four stars . there certainly quite few quick easy recipes , but there also some take quite bit prep work . if you're looking magazine mostly quick recipes , try their sister publication , quick cooking ( i subscribe one , well ... actually like it better . ) taste home no ads ( amazing ! ) , so it nice magazine chock full recipes information -- not fillers ads . this magazine also very " country " , so if you're looking something trendy cosmopolitan , this mag may not you . but if you like down-home country cookin ' , you'll likely love this magazine	1

i heard " books culture . " i never read it . then good friend college called one afternoon told me he sending me gift subscription . i've never enjoyed periodical this much . it given me hope . when george . bush reelected word " evangelical " spoken across country blame . regardless your political stance , point evangelicals seen stupid enough reelect what much rest nation saw poor president . even today , " evangelical " often used connote backwardness or stupidity . but " books culture " blows this assumption out water . you stumbled across publication voice god-fearing perspectives gender roles church , current philosophy theology , current film literature , politics , economics , cultural phenomena such internet ? this " books culture " most recent issue , thoughtfully honestly written , even when conclusions reached seem somewhat outside traditional conception things . subculture , we love answers . but it seems we entering new period growth our communities , one which questions equally important appropriately valued . why not begin tough questions ? you'll find many them " books culture . " p.s. dennis , if you ever read this , thanks subscription , bud .	1
there certainly lot hate wine spectator - , matter , wine advocate . many winemakers decry existence both magazines , usually lay blame entirely robert parker doorstep making 100-point rating system industry standard . wine spectator scores gotten better time , their articles . they've shied away california " glitz " looked more into food . also , education classes they list their website becoming increasingly more helpful . apparently they listened much criticism worked toward creating more respected magazine . i think they've well .	1
this light colorful newspaper . i remember when it first came out . idea it would national newspaper cover united states whole . it way gives local news regards all ' sections ' country . reporting itself clear very readable . paper lacks weight depth . it lot variety its features , clearly attempts entertain reader somehow make news more palatable . it not great newspaper but it often features fine reporting . there times when it better job than more prestigious papers .	1
whether you technical guru or someone who emphasis words , any serious filmmaker who takes his or her craft seriously love american cinematographer . official magazine american society cinematographers , this magazine gives you depth interviews dps directors technical approach towards shooting picture . they cover not just lab soups lighting techniques , but also approach script , design notes how visually approach script - other words , great detailed overview how this particular crew filmmakers went creating visual language film . not just film - technology advances , more films shot video , this magazine gives same great coverage those pictures well - star wars anniversary party . while it true there only so many films ac cover each issue but i think you'll end up feeling like i - i wish they could cover them all	1
two years ago , i became subscriber shape , mainly because i received it free part package deal magazine . i always liked browsing through issues shape supermarket , i thought subscriber would help support my fitness goals . overall , i enjoyed shape found it useful , but there definitely some negatives , magazine might not everyone . but first good . like many others mentioned , what i most enjoy shape their real-life weight stories featuring nice variety women , some whom actually needed * gain * weight order healthy . i also love their relatively new feature which they follow one their own staffers year-long weight loss journey . many their other regular features also excellent , particularly body part-focused strength exercises other how-to exercise guides . i especially like shape uses " reader models " so many their articles -- real life women various ages ( although admittedly , mostly 25-35 range ) normal , healthy , strong bodies . finally , their featured exercise plans each month often offer some unique variations traditional exercises , recipes often quite good well . main negative already brought up many others here : use too-skinny , not overtly fit or strong models illustrate much magazine . i find this extremely disappointing ; i understand sell magazines , models probably conform some traditional standards attractiveness , but those us buying magazine want see women who not only fit but also strong -- show us some muscles now then ! i said above , reader models great ; women usually quite fit , but they muscles curves too , which wonderful see . shape may trying make some improvements this area , last few covers featured famous women who exercise ( such denise richards ) , but they still long way go . while they're it , i hope they return their cover models dress fitness wear , not bathing suits ! they still show off their model physique showcase cute fitness wear same time . similarly , i would like see magazine get rid fashion segment end * unless * they start focusing it exercise clothing , not haute couture . if you overweight and/or new exercising , you may find magazine discouraging , but if you get past some negatives , it also inspiring . i think it up each individual determine whether magazine like this likely hurt or help her fitness efforts ; me , it helpful , but this definitely might not case everyone	1
i read this mag thru thru , some 20 + years now it continued top crop . it most superbly laid out designed magazine excellant content , i ever seen . totally honest , i would much rather read browse this any day over " print " magazine . this almost like graphic design book , just gets published every 2 months where best designers world given each 30 pages just go nuts . i found it deep stacks university library one day hooked ever since ... also those you who read/write japanese , german , english you your pick while reading ..	1
most this magazines travel articles ads not targeted someone like me . i'm homemaker limited budget . i don't travel much or am market fancy things they advertise . however , i just renewed my subscription becuase when i tried recipes magazine they really wonderful . i've added every recipe i've tried gourmet my ' keeper ' recipe binder . i admit , dishes harder make but results definitely worth trouble	1
relevant magazine great articles people who culture faith . many reviews secular artists , spiritual content or message ( or lack thereof ) music they sing , films they make books they write . they also review christian artists , many who fringe . this great magazine those who interested these things . if you just want ' youth-oriented ' christian magazine bible studies how-to you'll probably disapointed	1
potential interior designer , i find this magazine both realistic elegant articles it provides professional hobbiest . i subscription i find studying designers , styles themes i learned so much work designer . i would recommend it anyone who enjoys color , fabrics or just pictures beautifully designed rooms interiors	1
i like paula deen cooking , find i prefer order my magazines through amazon because they send me email update when my subscription really expire , so i choose renew , instead flooding me 6 months ' worth letters mail saying " renew now " or else , you'll miss issue . invariably , i never missed issue , but i certainly overpaid too soon sending subscription cards renewing too early when i may not wanted .	1

this pretty good magazine . niche it goes out every week thus it most current business news magazine out there ( if you compare it fortune , forbes ... ) . i always find 3-4 interesting articles there , but don't expect read cover cover	1
ordered this my son . sometimes it takes while , order reach him prison , so i'm not sure he received it yet . since you wrote reminded me , i'm thinking it get him , others returned	1
before i begin , there one thing you need know : i can't cook . i skills can't beaten when it comes heating stuff microwave , i use toaster oven , uh , toast things , but that it . no whipping up any fancy 30-minute meals me , which probably makes me only person who can't cook who actually buys this magazine . this should say great deal just how entertaining every day rachael ray actually . course , you might expect , i like rachael ray . it really would weird someone buy this magazine if they didn't cook they also hated rachael , i'm not weird ! however , although this ostensibly cooking-centric magazine , i'd argue it really reflects rachael attitude personality . her enthusiasm , love wide variety food , adventurous spirit shine through every page . all reports , rachael very hands-on developing this magazine , it shows . those who ask why they need read rachael ray magazine , since rachael all over television these days ( most recently her own syndicated daytime talk show ) , chew this : rachael isn't taking over world accident . she obviously doing something right dominating both food network daily schedule bestseller lists ( her ever-increasing line cookbooks ) . people just can't get their fill her ! so , what exactly her secret ? i think it boils down these factors : combination approachability charisma , which key ingredients superstardom ( think talented-yet-friendly stars such tom hanks or shakira ) . add dash optimism mixed spirit adventure , witnessed my favorite ray show , " $40 day , " which she explores new tourist destination each week , trying eat well insanely low budget . but what rachael ray magazine form , you're wondering ? well , my opinion , every day rachael ray appeals all tastes brilliantly translating her unique appeal tv screen printed page . i mentioned earlier , i probably won't cooking anything many recipes included each issue , but i still like checking them out . each recipe includes picture finished product , recipes lots variety creativity ... yum-o ! some so simple , like sandwiches or salads , i get feeling i might actually able attempt them if i really wanted ( see ? rachael " can-do " attitude even gets through kitchen-incompetent ! ) travel articles short pieces ( wide range topics such buying cheese , making mistakes kitchen , etc . ) also fun . but , rachael fan , i especially enjoy parts magazine written , or , rachael . one nice feature which readers send questions rachael which she personally answers . someone who participated lot " celebrity a " online past , i love these chances get know more someone famous who you may never meet person . fact , only reason i haven't rated every day rachael ray " five stars " because i'd like see even more rachael-related photos articles each issue ... how cool would ?! also , i'm hungry more interactivity : perhaps some food-themed sudoku , or some search-a-words . but fair , this relatively new magazine , all great magazines need time sort out what doesn't work . so far , every day rachael ray hit ground running off great start . i actually first person buy very first issue my local bookstore when it came out ( i got lucky happened there they set up display ) , i've looked forward each new issue ever since day . if you like rachael ray , you can't go wrong here ... start spending every day rachael ray " take bite outta life . " even if you can't boil water !	1
this great foodie magazine . we think writing what makes it great . it always interesting , some recipes try not usual food mag stuff . very enjoyable	1

too many christians ignorant our rich past . we know lot 1st century current times , but everything somewhat blank . christian history magazine more than informative ; it inspires , challenges even admonishes its unique way . i look forward each issue . i doubt i ever let this expire	1
i know it takes eight weeks maybe longer but i appreciate information i've gained store bought " maximum pc " magazines . i don't build computers but when i order one , it nice familier workings attributes new computer . yes ... you find much information on-line generally faster than amount time it takes magazine reach your mailbox , however , great kick back away computer your favorite chair ' read ' it :) very good magazine ... but ' adult ' language used times not appear me professional use english language . thus 4 rather than five stars	1

american spectator must read anyone considering themselves intellectual . not only articles witty well-researched , they also provide well-articulated arguments most pressing ( if sometimes slighlty out date ) controversies times . well worth subscription price , or even cover price	1
this most accurate geo-political socio-economic english-language news-weekly there . period . articles succinct , top-notch , cover everything world today business , economics environment . i think magazine tends focus bit too little environment religion , but my perception . despite editorial style very sophisticated diction , articles still easy understand . true , this magazine ( or newspaper , it calls itself ) staunchly pro-democracy ( i.e. broadly speaking , anti-russian policy , anti-chinese policy their respective conflicts , say , over georgia or taiwan , pro-war iraq issue ) , pro-free trade , pro-european ( i.e. expansion eu ) . but it takes many conservative liberatarian positions , too , oftentimes even liberal ones , which , overall , makes magazine fairly objective - you'll usually get all or most points-of-view after reading just few articles same subject , although economist usually imply , or sometimes downright state , which position it takes or world must take . actually that best part : it very refreshing magazine not afraid share its opinion offer its advice readers , hence its influence . this , me , icing cake . economics international relations student , i receiving economist some three years already . short time span , it source -- usually main source -- dozens my essays country reports ( country or topical surveys published every several weeks excellent this ! ) reading magazine increased my english vocabulary significantly . i finally feel my vocabulary increased third-grade level college-level . yes , it indeed take few weeks get used unique writing style , but magazine indispensible . some it may appear arrogant , which what i tend sense times , but not mean it bad magazine . quite simply , it tends think itself sophisticated , rightfully so . while half-owned financial times , many economist authors also write latter , which help explain while two similar . but while financial times daily newspaper fairly brief articles 50-50 slant news finance/business , economist articles , while also succinct , focus everything world impacts people . why it excellent summary world this week those people little time their hands . finally , i not necessarily sense anti-semitic slant stated one previous review . yes , i am jewish , but i tend regard economist proposed solutions -- such dealing hamas politically ( despite their " militancy " ) , they cannot destroyed -- middle east conflict mere pragmatism work . same its proposal legalize various drugs . not both these things ever happen today world ( mid-east conflict won't end ; drugs won't decriminalized most countries ) , but thinking purely pragmatic , which refreshing world so increasingly bent political correctness . this respect , aforementioned ones , i feel magazine lot more objective overall than many others , despite specific positions it takes particular articles . it makes truly fascinating read . it most surely investment it claims , so any those any remaining doubts , $129 subscription price ($77 students ) more than worth it . just read three or four issues you'll see . trust me	1
this magazine great recipies ! most them incredibly easy , but there few " adventuresome " ones every once while try when you feel up challenge . sometimes recipies need few more spices , so i usually add more than they say ( heck , it doesn't change calorie count ) . however , cooking light not trade calories taste , so whole family likes meal there many recipies i would proudly serve company ( majority , fact ) . there also just ton recipies per issue . only negative things i would say few recipies only marginally " healthy " sometimes there some redundancy . overall , it great buy	1

people most incredible magazine . writers magazine know exactly what you want read subscriber , but there always extra section just not interest you because no magazine attract every ones personal interests . no matter what this magazine always makes friday great day . i feel best part people magazine fact they give you special issues , like 50 most beautiful people , sexiest man alive , eligible bachelor . you get variety highlights each people issue . you find inside each issue many sections pertaining your interest . section called mailbox where you get read other people responses articles last issue released . passage page where they give you all details celebrities such marriages , births , divorces , deaths , injured , or convicted . finally , i love getting toward end magazine just able read true crime stories because they intriguing quite interesting . only bad part people magazine most people , just like myself , buy issues read celebrities . but you also get human interest stories which don't seem interest everyone . now i not subscription , but i read every issue , whether i buy them myself or read magazine work . i would say if you wanted purchase magazine this would great one choose because magazine reaches out any one their teenage years up	1

when funds tight i difficult time deciding which magazine subscriptions keep . each women magazine slightly different feel writing , though increased competition , these styles seem flux . i finally decided i preferred writing bazaar getting tired what i felt vogue cosmopolitan attempt catch larger readership ( if i want subscribe cosmo , i'll bloody well subscribe ) . featured designers more cutting edge less mainstream than what found vogue . it bit snottier ( though there far snottier magazines if you looking extreme fashions ) . among my complaints : bazaar obviously thinner magazine , while most vogue content adverts , it seem more articles . item i find highly irritating , bazaar society items . i really don't give ---- who wearing what what charity gala , especially when i don't play footsies these people . those complaints aside , this still my favorite fashion magazine	1

someone who recently become more interested healthier , organic way life , i decided check out several magazines subject matter . many not strike my fancy . example , i found organic style magazine little too fashion product-oriented my taste , while mind , body , spirit fitness seems little too redundant doesn't cover natural organic living all . natural health , however , falls somewhere , covering nice array topics including fitness/diet , natural remedies , beauty , food/recipes . someone who not interested explicitly holistic medicine naturopathy , i appreciate diversity this magazine offer . though many articles cover ideas products aren't entirely natural or organic , i still find them useful . many items articles , though not all , vegetarian-friendly well eco-conscious , which i appreciate . one my few complaints articles short , sometimes merely " glossing over " many topics . however , if one piques my interest , it decent jumping off point further research . though i can't compare previous version magazine everyone else seems preferred , i only began pick this up my local whole foods market last year , i say i am impressed what natural health offer it readers . sure , there several ads plaguing pages , but i still feel though there far fewer advertisements than many magazines shelves today . besides , some ads led me decent products i would not known otherwise . furthermore , this price , how anyone really go wrong	1

i agree this magazine boasts designer clothing extremely high prices most people cannot afford , but may people aware this magazine called " teen vogue " obviously follow it big sister footsteps . " vogue " not feature clothes walmart , so " teen vogue " not either . this magazine not necessarily cater only rich people . who says person should only buy magazine when she going get exact clothes featured it ? i am definitely no millionaire . i'm 16 years old still high school , but i enjoy this magazine immensely . course i dont slip out marc jacobs when i'm reading get myself shirt page 79 , but i look styles so i understand new trends just inspire myself some . magazines dont always realistic . fashion pursuing beauty covetting beauty , if all magazines only featured " affordable clothes ' walmart old navy , well .. i really wouldnt know what would like . " teen vogue " pure fashion magazine . it isnt all-round magazine young girls . it only fashion . it great job what it strives . fashion great taste great , shoots amazing . former reviewer reccomended " seventeen " i want note " seventeen " different type magazine entirely . seventeen extremely mainstream bubblegum not very fashion orientated . personally i not like magazine but i'm not going condemn it here . " teen vogue " classy , stylish , lives up it name . you dont rich kid read this magazine . but it only teen magazine out there which dedicated souly high fashion yes , features best fashion . people who not interested fashion probably hate this magazine , probably why it recieved so much criticism . i , other hand , love this magazine . only reason i didnt give it five stars because reviews above deemed stuff it affordable young girls strike me ridiculous . otherwise , look this magazine some fantastic fashion inspiration	1

revolver competing magazines heavy metal magazine world hit parader circus . i bought all three these magazines several times , revolver my final judgement revolver only magazine good enough subscribe . other two i still buy occasionally , but only wallpaper ( i cut out pictures bands magazines hang them my room . ) this magazine , way , like combination circus blender magazines ; it combines best aspects both . revolver still plenty great pictures , but it also much longer much better written than circus . it not quite long or stuffed full information blender , but make sure you note revolver only reports one genre ( heavy metal ! ) whereas blender could ( theoretically ) report every genre ( rap , pop , rock , etc . ) chances , if hard rock band ( especially big name hard rock band ) or already released c.d. , revolver story it . stories/reports very entertaining but they also informative sometimes lesson learned them . if it cover story , interview band also included ; if it not cover story , writer integrates quotes answers band into article , anyways ( even though it not formal interview ) . revolver writers frequently go tour band ( i.e. lamb god ) . case , they take reader backstage , tour bus , concert ( rundown show ) . when i first started reading this magazine , there sexual theme it . there would picture " hot babe " t-shirt , one side poster would woman-usually half-naked-in sexual pose . past year or so , revolver phased out ( probably appeal broader audience ) . i sometimes miss pictures " hot babes , " but this way there more room real heavy metal pictures . yet , even though sex isn't theme anymore , revolver probably bit too sophisticated anyone younger than teenager . plus , there usually profanities ( mainly " word . " ) so , i would say this magazine ages 13 up . monthly articles : -cover story-3 or 4 other biggish stories- " fresh blood " column ( where small biography given band you probably haven't heard of)- ask vinnie ( column where readers write questions , pantera/damageplan drummer vinnie paul gives advice)- hard rock news notes- black death metal news notes- " studio " ( update bands currently recording new music)-free poster ( middle magazine , there fold-out poster one or two bands . ) poster isn't very wide , but it two pages long-free music downloads- " ink spot " ( story musician favorite tattoo)- " favorite sh*t " ( interview musician , questions such " what your favorite color ? " )-joke band ( revolver just recently started doing this)- reviews ( reviews . . ' , music dvd , video games)pros : -- plenty good pictures free poster -- professionally written well known writers ( yet it not too intelligent teenagers) -- edited well ( i haven't found any mistakes or typos)-the " fresh blood " column usually introduces me band i haven't heard , but i should probably check out -- revolver accredited well known enough allowed go tours bands first interviews -- news columns ( both mainstream underground metal bands)-the stories always quotes band report -- free music ! ( revolver started doing page gives reader password , which he/she then access free music downloads online . ) -- no stupid questions interviews ( they ask up date questions , sometimes- i.e. interview puddle mudd-the writers aren't afraid ask daring , cutting questions) -- " studio " segment always informative -- helpful , reliable reviews ( they don't automatically praise every heavy metal . . ) cons : -- if you're up date your music news web sites , news columns shouldn't really anything new you . -- not all . . ' reviewed ( they give rundown c.d. article band , but . . ' bands cover magazine aren't usually reviewed . ) -concerts aren't reviewed-my biggest gripe it only issued once month . bottom line , if you're metalhead , this best magazine you get ! it more than well worth ten dollars you spend years worth entertainment	1
... while , yes , i've made comments past how oprah changed little , this publication . i'm sure person who wrote " this just magazine full things one can't afford " reads fashion or celebrity magazines full many things she can't afford . advertising generates money , while i don't like ads either , they everywhere because advertising works . if you don't want see them , don't buy magazines , watch tv or go anywhere . far layouts " too full clutter " ... everyone their own style . there some people who like look don't prefer pared-down , zen look . magazines not reality . if they , they wouldn't plastered plastic , bronzed 6 ' females who weigh 100 lbs . i'm originally middle america , nobody looks like there . just take magazines ads what they . save your money , like i , things you just . if you don't perserverence , then stick target walmart circulars . knock-offs never far behind .	1

no other magazine i'm aware gets more undeserved criticism than rollingstone . writing supurb . i don't know why everyone assumes pop culture magazines must all sensationalist rags same vein teen beat . complaining too many talentless teen icons put cover pointless -- it after all magazine delves into pop culture . not liking subject matter isn't just cause criticize . record review section best any music mag . it 100% idiotic assume their reviews bogus just because some band or group you wouldn't ever consider listening anyway got " good " rating . beauty their reviews they pander neither music elitists nor so-called " teeny-boppers , " their reviewers smart enough able differentiate what makes good pop music what makes good experimental music . rollingstone not specialty magazine that going say certain type music great type crap . it just music pop culture mag , damn good one	1

this most accurate geo-political socio-economic english-language news-weekly there . period . articles succinct , top-notch , cover everything world today business , economics environment . i think magazine tends focus bit too little environment religion , but my perception . despite editorial style very sophisticated diction , articles still easy understand . true , this magazine ( or newspaper , it calls itself ) staunchly pro-democracy ( i.e. broadly speaking , anti-russian policy , anti-chinese policy their respective conflicts , say , over georgia or taiwan , pro-war iraq issue ) , pro-free trade , pro-european ( i.e. expansion eu ) . but it takes many conservative liberatarian positions , too , oftentimes even liberal ones , which , overall , makes magazine fairly objective - you'll usually get all or most points-of-view after reading just few articles same subject , although economist usually imply , or sometimes downright state , which position it takes or world must take . actually that best part : it very refreshing magazine not afraid share its opinion offer its advice readers , hence its influence . this , me , icing cake . economics international relations student , i receiving economist some three years already . short time span , it source -- usually main source -- dozens my essays country reports ( country or topical surveys published every several weeks excellent this ! ) reading magazine increased my english vocabulary significantly . i finally feel my vocabulary increased third-grade level college-level . yes , it indeed take few weeks get used unique writing style , but magazine indispensible . some it may appear arrogant , which what i tend sense times , but not mean it bad magazine . quite simply , it tends think itself sophisticated , rightfully so . while half-owned financial times , many economist authors also write latter , which help explain while two similar . but while financial times daily newspaper fairly brief articles 50-50 slant news finance/business , economist articles , while also succinct , focus everything world impacts people . why it excellent summary world this week those people little time their hands . finally , i not necessarily sense anti-semitic slant stated one previous review . yes , i am jewish , but i tend regard economist proposed solutions -- such dealing hamas politically ( despite their " militancy " ) , they cannot destroyed -- middle east conflict mere pragmatism work . same its proposal legalize various drugs . not both these things ever happen today world ( mid-east conflict won't end ; drugs won't decriminalized most countries ) , but thinking purely pragmatic , which refreshing world so increasingly bent political correctness . this respect , aforementioned ones , i feel magazine lot more objective overall than many others , despite specific positions it takes particular articles . it makes truly fascinating read . it most surely investment it claims , so any those any remaining doubts , $129 subscription price ($77 students ) more than worth it . just read three or four issues you'll see . trust me	1
i could not carry life i know it without economist . no hype . it good . this american reviewer became hopelessly addicted economist news analysis during four years england . magazine - or ' newspaper ' , it stubbornly insists calling itself - published london , though 2005 largest national readership united states . editorial line libertarian more moderate european sense word . essential values individual liberty , modest state , free market economics . don't let name fool you . this weekly far more than economist rag . its anonymous writing current events if fabulous , not mention top-ranked analysis letters , arts , like . let me give you concrete example how economist excels . years , i paid close attention its coverage latino immigration issues usa . one might suppose british magazine would disadvantage when exploring this complex topic , yet economist coverage routinely surpasses us newspapers magazines , perhaps largely because its disdain self-suppressing ' pc ' tactics . only area which i detect broad deficiency this magazine coverage role religion , particularly america . secularist european spectacles its editors wear seem make it impossible them canvass this phenomenon view religion continued fervor advanced western nations something other than retrograde slightly amusing . i tell my university-age nephews - thankfully , they ask - anchor their news consumption one weekly , then read widely beyond it . economist very best anchor available english-reading sailors	1

i subscribed multiple photography magazines first when i started getting serious photography . i subscribed ' photography ' ' american photo ' this one , popular photography imaging . three this magazine most balanced amount reviews , ' how tos ' , digital imaging related topics ( photoshop , etc ) well some nice contests . also they seem sponsor more ' mentor series ' type products where you go some locale shoot photos reasonable fee . all magazines this also something important me - half magazine isn't ads . photography worst offender this , there'd 50 or so pages weak articles , then 50 pages solid ads . while this one chunk ads near back , it still ' back page ' article articles mixed among ads . only 25% magazine advertisements . they also support nice online website ( popphoto.com ) forum where people logon ask questions . while not heavily trafficked say dpreview.com authors editors read respond questions . overall great magazine hobby	1
yes - there tons great shots mag ; great articles ( french only ) , contests --- very chic .... however ---- customer service treat you like redheaded stepchild when you ask them " why you not sent me latest issue photo ??

i only got first issue , but it seems focused more poets than other writers ( hence name ) . i dont enjoy poetry but i love writing fiction . they might well keep two separate , especially contests events . it attractive format very upscale , high quality literature reviews advice . stories well written enjoyable , although i think writers digest offers more fiction writers	1
atlantic classic cultural , political literary voice america . first published team included legendary icons such ralph waldo emerson , oliver wendell holmes henry wadsworth longfellow , this periodical went include articles great historical figures such mark twain , woodrow wilson martin luther king jr. it may hard place current contributors next those specific individuals who came before them , but they stand tall contemparies published similar venues . this not magazine those who currently feel they well enough informed current crop " news-tainment " programs , talking heads mouthpieces found air waves today . here you'll find in-depth , critical analysis intelligent literature . you disagree some points view might you feel compelled label something it pages conservative or liberal ? maybe , but it understandable today climate . i would suggest you'd probably trying too hard , perhaps unconsciously , fit authors articles into particular partisan column . letters editor tend highlight differing points view so i encourage you read back following month see how others respond get feel magazine . i think most reasonable people tend find this magazine well worth time read regularly . recently there usually one full length article related issue middle east each month , which should expected current events , but content varies significantly within each issue you won't feel overwhelmed . there regular sections columns ranging travel book reviews fiction " post mortem " profiling some notable world figure who recently passed away . way comparison , harper new yorker probably closest style , though new yorker comes out weekly ( mostly ) instead monthly ( mostly ) like atlantic harper . if you're trying decide three , pick up each them two or three months see which you like best . i prefer atlantic overall , but if i time , i may pick up one or other if some particular topic it particularly interest me . bottom line , you could lot worse than subscribe atlantic	1
this monthly magazine opinionated breath fresh air . it philosophically allied libertarianism , but it not extreme or strident . reason more mainstream moderate than left or right ; it really political common sense . i don't always agree articles , but i rarely object reasoning supports them . point view isn't beholden agendas or special interests , read reason .	1
reason cannot labeled conservative or leftist . nor it extremist libertarian magazine like liberty , fawning over ayn rand . it bases its commentary assumption , if we some faith , our chaotic culture lead somewhere good . but if we try monitor control it excessively , we dampen human creativity end up muddled conflicted . reason takes all aspects culture assumes international perspective . its arguments laid out carefully but contain percolating sense indignation our increasingly repressive environment . same time , they more informative than polemical ; each report grounded specifics - quotes , anecdotes , studies . this most intelligent inquiring " political " journal available . if only it came out more often	1

two years ago , i became subscriber shape , mainly because i received it free part package deal magazine . i always liked browsing through issues shape supermarket , i thought subscriber would help support my fitness goals . overall , i enjoyed shape found it useful , but there definitely some negatives , magazine might not everyone . but first good . like many others mentioned , what i most enjoy shape their real-life weight stories featuring nice variety women , some whom actually needed * gain * weight order healthy . i also love their relatively new feature which they follow one their own staffers year-long weight loss journey . many their other regular features also excellent , particularly body part-focused strength exercises other how-to exercise guides . i especially like shape uses " reader models " so many their articles -- real life women various ages ( although admittedly , mostly 25-35 range ) normal , healthy , strong bodies . finally , their featured exercise plans each month often offer some unique variations traditional exercises , recipes often quite good well . main negative already brought up many others here : use too-skinny , not overtly fit or strong models illustrate much magazine . i find this extremely disappointing ; i understand sell magazines , models probably conform some traditional standards attractiveness , but those us buying magazine want see women who not only fit but also strong -- show us some muscles now then ! i said above , reader models great ; women usually quite fit , but they muscles curves too , which wonderful see . shape may trying make some improvements this area , last few covers featured famous women who exercise ( such denise richards ) , but they still long way go . while they're it , i hope they return their cover models dress fitness wear , not bathing suits ! they still show off their model physique showcase cute fitness wear same time . similarly , i would like see magazine get rid fashion segment end * unless * they start focusing it exercise clothing , not haute couture . if you overweight and/or new exercising , you may find magazine discouraging , but if you get past some negatives , it also inspiring . i think it up each individual determine whether magazine like this likely hurt or help her fitness efforts ; me , it helpful , but this definitely might not case everyone	1

regular readers my reviews probably getting sick me mentioning kage baker , but i credit her getting me try lot things i wouldn't normally try if she hadn't part them . asimov science fiction magazine time where this case . while i bought fantasy science fiction magazine every month while now , i would also check asimov see if it baker story . if it , i would buy it . what i found , however , i enjoyed most other stories issues i bought well . thus , now i buying it every month too . much like fantasy science fiction , asimov contains mostly science fiction stories various lengths ( short story , novelette , novella ) couple columns some cartoons . difference two asimov contains no fantasy ( though some mike resnick stories fantasy feel them ) . however , magazine likes concentrate character-based science fiction , so you won't see lot " technology first , character second " stories magazine . personally , i think that good thing hard science fiction turns me off . if you're more into hard sciences , you may find stuff here interest you , but there good chance you won't . occasionally , there guest editorials ( they printed george r.r. martin guest honor speech worldcon october/november issue ) . there always " books " column , sometimes written paul di filippo , sometimes peter heck . authors use this column recommend books you may not come across . robert silverberg opens each issue " reflections " column cover everything space exploration ideas story-writing . james patrick kelly occasionally featured " net " column , examining various science fiction web sites other online activities . unlike fantasy science fiction , there often some poetry included well . finally , there calendar upcoming conventions covers world so you always find someplace go if you need get together group fans . bread butter magazine , though , stories . each story introduction editor ( currently gardner dozois , though change sheila williams january issue ) , which may explain genesis story , or just tell us how long it since author appeared asimov . one things asimov different it often serializes stories eventually appear book form . allen . steele coyote series serialized over last couple years all them collected two books ( coyote couple years ago , upcoming coyote rising ) . also , charles stross ' accelerando featured recent issues . one drawback this readers who only pick up occasional issue . instance , " survivor " october/november issue didn't really mean lot because i've missed everything came before it . it reward regular readers , though . asimov many writers who write almost exclusively magazine , or very least authors submit their stories this magazine first refusal . my favourite , kage baker , only seems appear here , only one story i know appearing realms fantasy . allen . steele . robert reed seems featured everywhere ( i swear guy churning them out like he machine ) but he featured lot asimov . magazine bound just like fantasy science fiction , however cover thin paper rather than thicker stock , so it tear bit easier . this advantage you sometimes leave it lying open reading ( though this only works if you're toward middle it ) . it also means it rolled up if necessary . only other fault i it , this strictly personal thing , stories don't always grab me much they fantasy science fiction . this mainly because i'm more into fantasy than science fiction , so this certainly wouldn't case everyone . while hit miss ratio varies issue issue , i say i never skipped story magazine . again , that benefit short fiction . you're not going waste lot time them . if i choose two magazines , i would definitely choose fantasy science fiction . however , asimov certainly good enough it easy make room both them . plus , picking them both up , i feel like i'm doing my part keeping short fiction alive . it only small part , but every little bit helps . david ro	1

i find interesting articles every issue i receive . i like fact articles offer wide range topics . example , you find articles relating diet , travel , relationships physiology . all issues provide yoga sequences you practice home . magazine offer advanced sequences more physically demanding simplier ones much less physically demanding . articles portray nicely sized color photos pose in-depth explanations how perform each pose . i am visual person who needs see more complex poses performed front me rather than described writing , so unfortunately , i can't take advantage some more difficult sequences . however , if practicing yoga some time familar enough wide range poses , or follow in-depth written instruction , you enjoy these sections . you may surprised volume advertisements found each issue . it doesn't bother me because there still remains plenty good reading each issue . you receive only 7 issues 12 month period . it would nice receive one every month . overall , entertaining informative magazine i recommend . yoga journal also fantasic website you explore free . website offers many interesting articles provides instruction information many common yoga poses .	1

american girl magazine geared girls aged 7-13 . much younger than many girls aren't reading appropriate level yet . much older they may ready move . but honestly i'm surprised read so many reviews 10 or 11 year old girls who feel they're too old this magazine . i don't believe girls age need magazines based solely makeup tricks , flirting boys , etc . ag articles such dealing relationships friends . like when you your best friend start grow apart . or when she moves away . articles like one girl whose family travels around world their sailboat two years . crafts you actually proud give age 10 . several reviewer complained magazine short expensive . it . but here why : there no advertising ( short anything american girl related ) . many magazines , advertising accounts easily half pages . advertising enables publishers sell magazines low cost . ag no advertising so charge fair price produce it . i'm more than willing pay kind publication . parents ordering your daughters , you know your girl . if you've got 10 year old going 16 , this may not your child . if you precocious 6 year old , she might like it well . ag kind magazine i'm glad my daughters enjoy	1

us weekly used cross people national enquirer - ever since new editor stepped ( it seems they new one every year ) magazine revamped . it looks more like classy people less like trash tabloid . i'm also little skeptical those who complain amazon.com doesn't deliver their magazines . not every business perfect , but i haven't problem my magazines delivered when i've ordered them amazon.com . it just makes me think all people whining just taking out their frustrations life amazon.com . maybe its why we see so many vicious jealous reviews , if you don't like your life change it . don't complain it , that how most people get where they today . anyway , unlike people , us weekly mainly focuses celebrities i think its price its far too short . least people thick . anyhow , celebrity junkie , us weekly must read . like reviewer , i too am tired reading jessica simpson brangelina . i think celebrity magazines tired this well . i'm starting see more diverse focus celebrities magazines . its certainly much better than reading touch life style weekly . although i like us weekly , i still think people best . people more classy , great layout , their focus 50/50 celebrities articles average folks . they great photos other interesting reads their magazine . even their website great , us weekly website looks like barbie website . recent changes great but if us weekly really wants compete people then it needs step up plate more . despite its faults , us weekly luscious read worth all its frothiness , so enjoy it .	1

this my favorite home/decorating/architecture magazine all time . perhaps it fortuitous coincidence , but " cottage living " always features homes areas country very interesting me - like adirondacks , boulder co , arlington va , asheville nc new orleans . editors good understanding cottage admirers their interests . therefore , they include floor plans , before after pictures , brief back-stories give us glimpse into life cottages their inhabitants . we get see cottages very different characters based their geographic region , their original purpose , style socioeconomic standing their owners . some homes really stretch definition cottage because their large size , but - usually - they convey spirit snug informal home anyway . we see cottage owners very ingenious using all interior space available . i love see how people used dormers , areas under staircase , other niches things activities would otherwise not practical because limited square footage . small space used wisely attractively challenge all cottage owners face . this magazine provides ideas galore .

one american evangelicalism sympathetic critics once asked whether there such thing christian mind . all sorts reasons - some more than justified - questioners , skeptics , malnourished pilgrims produced negative responses query . but perhaps things better than all . if encouragement ma taken books culture : christian review , there hope kind wide-ranging integration faith intellect so routinely dismissed implausible cynical , misinformed those who yet discover intellectual renaissance among evangelicals populated university departments ( philosophy physics spring mind parade examples ) proponents robust biblical faith . publication christianity today empire , books culture provides forum some most incisive writing cutting-edge thinking found among christians anywhere . one not talking puff pieces cotton-candy testimony . rather , kind thoughtful self-critical engagement great conversation myriad contemporary issues one expects fat intellectual monthlies reviews new york london times offer here , abundance . this reviewer - who fights his wife possession issue sometimes finds them tucked away bedroom squirrel-holes which she believes him ignorant - watched this young-ish paper emerge something renegade among evangelical organs find its voice stride within just few years . its trajectory not far astonishing . christian century once known thought this quality still hits occasional home run . if it cans sustain its current run , books culture , looks rather . 325 hitter which franchise glory made	1

all music orientated magazines i subscribe , outburn my personal favorite . this only magazine caters my favorite music ... techno , goth , industrial music . rolling stone stopped relevant 10 years ago . spin magazine joke . alternative press also joke stopped relevant many , many moons ago . i discovered outburn when i saw article one my personal favorite bands all time , vnv nation . rolling stone , spin , ap wouldn't touch vnv nation ten foot pole because it isn't popular brainwashed masses . last year . since then , i loyal reader well loyal subscriber quarterly magazine . what appeals me most outburn magazine covers more than just goth industrial music but also lesser known metal bands like lacuna coil opeth . i'm not metal fan long shot but it refreshing read magazine which heavy metal bands [ pooh ] mtv clear channel , er , radio plays non-stop ( i.e korn , deftones , limp bizkit ) . outburn covers lesser known metal bands mtv wouldn't dare play except maybe new incarnation " headbanger ball " . i also enjoy original questions writers throws artists bands they interview . they also don't sound patronizing or condescending one bit . unlike spin magazine which now become forum video games fashion opposed music , outburn sticks what it knows best which music . although marilyn manson cover new issue outburn , least i grateful editors didn't throw good charlotte cover . thing i love outburn free cd offer subscribers . nothing beats like free cd . my only problem outburn it quarterly magazine , not monthly magazine . i wish rags like ap , spin , rs quarterly magazines outburn monthly but all its worth , least outburn reliable terms quality articles doesn't insult my intelligence throwing justin timberlake christina aguilera cover like rs recently . outburn truly one few magazines i enjoy reading word word	1

if you one whose definition rock music fairly elastic whose taste rock music eclectic , then i recommend mojo magazine you . i haven't read all magazines relating music course , but those i , mojo best job covering music scene today . its approach fresh its appeal wide . unlike some other music mags around , it one whole family read probably find something musically meaningful each . its writers , whose taste music broad , approach music without allowing personal prejudices color their articles . they find much merit new nick cave cd they new bert bacharach effort , if music worthwhile they it without gushing . recent issue highlighted bob dylan , marianne faithfull , sid vicious sex pistols each which certainly appeal different audiences . thing i like best mojo each issue comes cd featuring various artists doing whatever type music focus month lead article . cd really adds value me anticipating next one . i never thought i'd like sex pistols , but when i heard feature cd songs influenced them , i understood their music lot better . you might get better deal magazine than offered here if you go bookstore , find magazine , look insert bearing special offer . that what i . whatever way you decide try magazine up you , but i'd surprised if you didn't find it informative , enjoyable , money well spent	1
if you fan certain genre music , it mainstream pop , punk or hip-hop , there least few magazines cater your taste . rarity magazine caters all-around pop music fanatic , mojo magazine tops obscure lis t.t his pricey publication , but well worth money . since discovering magazine several years ago , i amazed diversity cover features alone : beatles , abba , frank zappa , kate bush , white stripes , michael jackson , rolling stones , sex pistols , madonna ... there something everybody taste , plenty people wide range musical taste . cover features inside , i am always amazed space they give performers and/or bands small cult following . i especially enjoyed piece they incredible string band several years back . they usually when covering group history , mojo writers not shy away friction low points involved band career . no tabloid trash-talking or finger pointing , just good solid journalism ; showing strengths makes icon popularity endure , bumps road ended ride . reviews cds plenty , i often find myself discovering something new add my collection . you'll find reviews pop , punk , folk , blues , country , classic rock , you name it ! i also find reviewers lot more open minded when reviewing albums , which welcome holiday plethora snobbish music critics who go out their way trash good efforts . mojo , my humble opinion , top music mags . if you over all pop-culture fan like i am , always lookout something new add your collection , then mojo magazine should key resource your database !	1

i reader fan dog world since i my first dogs 1981 . avid dog-lover since childhood , i always enjoyed breeder ads discovering breeds new me . these days one my favorite sections " rare breeds " . i thoroughly enjoy bi-annual " all breed " special issue . although each issue profile breed dog , what i like better than dog fancy profiles more informative in-depth . dog world also covers rare breeds their profiles , not just akc breeds . i would recommend dog world dog professionals avid dog-lovers involved dog sports ; dog fancy more casual dog people	1

growing up church , i've received lot christian magazines , depth analysis scripture , qa highschool drama help , but all fallen short what young christians today looking . i followed relevant magazine before they released their 1st magazine kept up amazing articles online . i very excited debut magazine made god relevant specific everyday life decisions made god seem ever more practical way we construct our lifestyles . god obviously great things this staff still working . their podcast also great really demonstrates character today young christian thinkers who excited their faith willing show it . they bring lot hope pray christians living culture denies christ . i'm not twentysomething quite yet , but message relevant important which : put away your indifference go out make mark culture glory god	1
relevant magazine reaches our culture , rather than form its own christian sub-culture . while magazine definetly aimed towards " 20-something " demographic it still speak all generations . it covers most important topics facing our world today , christian secular . it also covers books , movies good music . interviews include , cameron crow ( director " elizabethtown " " vanilla sky " ) , bono u2 , lovedrug copeland . writing somewhat shallow times , but overall isn't bad . magazine fit finish second none christian magazine market , thick glossy pages colrful , thick covers , although it could longer . this surely one best christian mags out there today . if your christian ready move christianity into next generation , i would highly recomend this magazine . if you like music i would recomend paste magazine , its owned christian covers some most excellent music around today	1
quite frankly this only cooking magazine i ever subscribed i actually looked forward using receiving every two months . i like it so much i am writing my first amazon review ! format magazine makes it easy follow recipes - they always printed two pages across each other - unlike some other posters i prefer black white format so paper thicker doesn't tear easily . tear away ads ( their own products ) outside magazine means usable portion doesn't take up much space my shelf . recipes easy follow usually clear . when they include specialized ingredients there usually also substitution listed . their product reviews terrific - i wish i hadn't wasted so many dinners bad whole wheat pasta . my only gripe , someone who not dishwasher , great number bowls kitchen tools recipes require . i made least half recipes magazines , many several times , which no small feat " flexitarian " who never meat main dish .	1
prevention more guilty pleasure me than anything else . it definitely not magazine you file away your beloved books ( i victoria , real simple , o ) , but you take little something each issue . it contain lot excellent information ranging herbs emotional health physical conditions , but articles really more than one or two pages long ( most ) it doesn't take long read cover cover . regardless , i enjoy it , usually learn something new interesting each issue . i'm not complete health nut , but i am interested long term issues try look out myself . most health magazines ( exception health ) too specific- each article really only applies certain group people , but most articles prevention apply entire readership whole . there very few us out there not struggling stress or interested ways preventing heart disease or cancer	1
macworld glossy monthly around long apple making macs . i've subscriber most time - if i saved past issues - could probably paper cupertino main streets this periodical pages . there number magazines devoted macs their unusually devoted users . macworld probably most mainstream dependable them . most periodicals dedicated high-tech fields , there more these pages than casual user digest . many articles appeal macgroupies subset macusers , those who find product fascinating itself rather than merely boon productivity dedicated other ends . however , even normal macuser like myself ( since 1987 ) enjoy coverage all things apple , including constant improvements which company become known relentless speculation what comes next . small tornado controversy brews pages over whether macworld should dedicate so much space ipod music issues , but apple seems fairly dictated its sprint direction magazine dedicated covering company products need follow direction it sets . there lots productivity hints - if followed - keep you increasing your own effectiveness machine . most useful feature me high-quality discussion improvements apple continues build into its own operating system(s ) . macworld go-to mac magazine , if that what you need	1

someone who reads lot magazines who left-liberal , i remain stalwart supported new republic . this despite fact , yes , they supported iraq war . their crucial failing enterprise they assumed bush would work democrats , etc ., actually get job . it easy anti-war left bash them after fact , but least you say they take moral ethical high road : they've advocating military intervention humanitarian grounds years , even if , case iraq , they made many mistakes , fact they represent american left willing intervene non-self-interested grounds important itself . many people suggested tnr steadily moved right under tenure martin peretz , but they remain committed some most important issues american liberals : universal health care , gay rights ( their most conservative editor , after all , andrew sullivan , openly gay republican ) progressive economics . jonathan chait probably best political-economics journalist working us today . yes , they decidedly centrist , yes , they feature large number conservative writers , finally yes , they unapologetically pro-israeli middle east issues which puts off american college left , but their analysis top notch , their reporting incredibly insightful , despite no longer " in-flight reading air force one , " they remain indispensable anyone wanting understand washington elite . arts front they're even more consistent : stanley kaufmann film criticism insightful top-notch ; i wish they more robert brustein theater , though least you give them credit national magazine which still drama desk . jed perl often insufferable his art criticism , but he very smart engaging . leon wieseltier , literary editor , one i like least , he given long , wincingly verbose pieces ( rarely books ) , but he one eminences grise american literary criticism . more engaging controversial james wood , whose occasional fiction reviews absolutely worth reading ; again , i rarely agree him , but he indispensable . just because you agree believer more doesn't make them more interesting read . basically , tnr great anyone who actually interested what going wants intellectually challenged ; end , i rarely outright agree their writers , but unlike nation or mother jones , they don't bother preaching choir , writing much better ( end , i only kept my nation subscription going arthur . danto occasional art pieces ) .	1

i'm usually not one taking chance new magazines ( especially if they've shoved down public throats or oprah winfrey endorses it ) but this one instance where oprah gets major-league credit putting her faith money rachael ray . i impressed magazine layout - not too elementary nor too complicated - recipes contained within delicious easy prepare ( you won't go searching every speciality shop country ingredients , either ) . i also like how rachael let readers her italian wedding african safari honeymoon . unlike other celebrities , she didn't let us know too much information ( thank you ! ) i'm sure her recommendations trattorias , cafes , hotels tuscany worth time easy budget . just because she doesn't initials besides her name culinary degree ( she not only one food network lacking this ! ) , rachael spent her whole life restaurants food she learned same tricks trade fusion chefs network know . this definitely worth look i'm seriously considering ordering subscription .	1

art america seems won vote most popular periodical arts . quality reporting world events , informed writers who critique investigate , style referencing used articles makes this magazine immensely readable . this not most sophisticated journal art ( modern painters some other european magazines win there ) , but balance coverage reviews america well international scene very fine . ads well designed reproduced - even if there few too many ' vanity spaces ' . constant all available art magazines stand complaint overemphasis new york gallery reviews : new york not hub it once importance los angeles , san francisco , chicago , etc not recognized writers/editors . exhibitions reviewed solid reportage , if unduly weighted edgy installation quirky art . but august issues gallery guide this magazine them all topped !	1

friend mine told me " fast company " year ago , i subscriber avid reader since then . magazine enigmatic , combining news magazine , cultural commentary , business reporting , entrepreneurial insights into one publication . many issues deserve five star rating , but occasionally cohesion editorial focus bit uneven . thing i most like " fast company " 21st century approach news analysis : it thought provoking , explores all sides complex issues , but never tries tell reader what think . perfect example this april , 2006 issue article " al jazeera ( global ) mission , " which former us marine now working english-language version al jazeera profiled extremely multi-faceted story . entrepreneurial bent magazine great younger managers small business professionals , reporting market trends second none . although there times i don't agree articles or editorials " fast company , " i always find them intellectually stimulating thought provoking . i recommend this magazine independent thinkers everywhere	1

yo he leido varias revistas o magazines como tambien les llaman tales como , seventeen , cosmopolitan , vogue , self , glamour , mademoiselle , teen , lucky , teen vogue , marie claire , por mencionar algunas , tanto las versiones en ingles como en espaol definitivamente me quedo con elle . es superior las demas , primera tiene excelente fotografia muy buenas impresiones , su moda es cosmopolita global , ademas de que presenta diseadores nuevos que aun todavia no son conocidos pero gracias esta revista sus carreras son impulsadas rapidamente la fama , sus propuestas reviews sobre cine , musica , libros teatro tambien son muy buenos , tiene cultura pop pero no es del tipo teenybopper como en otras revistas que se obsesionan con ciertas actrices o cantantes de ahi no salen . sus paginas de moda son preciosas aunque es cierto que muchas de las modelos que salen posando en estas paginas se ve que son anorexicas o le entran las drogas , tampoco me gusta el precio de muchas de estas ropas accesorios ya que por lo general van de 2000 1 millon de dolares , por favor pongan algo mas accesible economico . tambien tiene articulos de interes para todos , ya sea de salud , relaciones , sexo , belleza , politica , cultura o decoracion , estos son variados algunos son muy buenos , otros aburridos , otros son superficiales o estupidos , otros son solo trivialidades . pero en definitiva esta revista es muy buena , pero eso si es muy elitista , esta hecha para mujeres con estilo propio , que tienen educacion de colegio o universidad , que se visten para ellas mismas no para los demas , diferencia de cosmo , glamour , marie claire que claman ser feministas en lugar de eso son antifeministas o pseudo feministas , elle si les da un buen lugar sus lectoras , en lugar de llenarles el cerebro con puro sexo tarugadas de como contentar tu hombre , amigo o lo que sea , convertirte en una barbie para el como dicen estas revistas que acabo de mencionar	1

play definitely breath fresh air someone who truly engulfed second-hand suck . years magazines like egm , gamepro ( shudder ) , only multi-platform magazines i would read . i later became tired their increasing ridiculousness , both content reviews , so after suggested i check out this magazine many fellow gamers i decided , hesitantly , so . i mean how different could multi-platform magazine ? very . not only am i captivated wonderful choice cover art each month ( amazon should change display cover over shadow colossus one ) , but pages size publication more professional than any gaming mag currently out . ( i admit not read game informer , due their paper mario : thousand year door fiasco , i never intend . ) i could only think myself stupid not heeding words others sooner . my first copy issue 39 , march 2005 , sega choice cover main content month . wow , there content . nice spread sega upcoming lineup , interviews company people/developers captivated me more . reviews awesome , still awesome well , sometimes spilling over 2 pages more frequently than " competitors . " i knew right away this what i looking : magazine liked all kinds games wasn't afraid show it both previews reviews , magazine not insult my intelligence , nor choice games . i not seen one word " kiddie " or " baby game " attack because colorful sprites , or lighthearted content . quite contrary , magazine seems ardent its protection 2-d games , games just fun regardless how they look ; something very welcome this day age gaming . i also like how they some biting criticism , but still seem upbeat . take their 2005 e3 wrap-up issue where they criticized everything show itself , phantom games , specs next-gen hardware , but still positive things say them . not only , but magazine , once again , incredible coverage . how some interviews people such : hideo kojima ( metal gear ; boktai ) , tomonobu itagaki ( doa ; ninja gaiden ) , atsushi inaba ( viewtiful joe ; okami ) , koji igarashi ( castlevania ) , michael ancel ( rayman ; beyond good evil ; king kong ) , takao miyoki ( phantasy star universe ) , masato maegawa ( ceo treasure) ? simply incredible . not mention their brilliant cover story shadow colossus interviews developers . i cannot say enough how good this magazine . if i could use my years knowing gaming mags , sum up what magazine like , i would say it like cross now gone next generation , gamefan its anime section -- but very much mind its own . ( those worried anime section , it located back , so you won't miss out anything gaming related if you choose skip over it . ) i seriously implore you give it chance , even if you fan other magazines . go your local bookstore look through it , you don't purchase it , just see yourself . hopefully , you'll experience true difference play	1

(...) other magazines write similar topics outrageously priced their articles misleading you never learn anything actual relevance topics cover . one prime example this us weekly . i read several issues this past usually way someone giving mag me when they it i've actually only personally bought us weekly twice . but it style annoys me it magazine wants write interesting celebrity driven issues but often fails . please not confuse touch us weekly . what i sometimes think other people might easily dismiss touch like us especially since they sometimes feature same celebs right next each other newstands . touch keeps you " touch " celebrities their important/interesting stories happening week week their lives . but you don't feel like stalker or something reading this magazine i read other people comment us . touch always stays safe distance celebs personal lives not cross line their articles no matter who or what article written touch keeps up respectful tasteful point view subject/celebrity hand . they also talk important things public eye , such this weeks issue these few stories : people news section : cynthia nixon brand new life - this article talking how cynthia now found love happiness her life her lover woman . i no clue this till reading article . article just tells straight up facts , quote one cynthia friends saying " she totally love nothing hide . she two beautiful kids , money bank , incredible career , emmy career , now girlfriend . so cynthia , life couldn't better she wants share her happiness world ! " , nothing bad said article .. you tell , quite opposite . this way touch handles itself - it tells facts more happy things celebs lives less worse . but what i meant before it talks even no celeb issues this next story people news : * under survivors heading*montana plane crash miracle - man woman first presumed dead plane crash , but woman , jodee hogg managed free herself plane wreckage then free fellow parks co-work matthew ramige . they stayed anthor fellow passanger while he died then left get help walked two half miles - matthew broken back burns . it really amazing . kelly ripa advice working momsis joaquin still mourning his brother ? prince harry gets seriousmary kay defends her crimethere cover story . lo jennifer garner what . lo thinks " bennifer 2 " she still love ben . but even handled respectfully closest thing it gets sensationalizing it page entitled battle jens but it more fun than anything plainly obvious . here few more headings articles within mag - i think they pretty self explanatory so i'm just going list them : you friends your lover ex ? - three not crowd renee , jack his former wife , meg . fashion trauma - even celebs strike out , but these oops outfits saved ? why chip kim win $1 millionat home kelly osbourne - her pink paradisejerry favorite food stop - crossing jordan star jerry o'connel takes touch carney lathe 10 sexiest men season - it raining men this autumn , hollywood hunks strutting their stuff all over big small screens . what makes them best ? she plus-size model proud ! - america next top model toccara happy just way she . fatherhood changed my life ! - mark wahlberg talks his journey crotch grabbing bad boy devoted dadis tyra next oprah ? several more . i especially like section : it true ? - real story behind hottest gossip . you read this know what told truth . i noticed way more celebrities open up allow touch interviews tell them first hand facts than * other * magazines . also featured this issue article kevin costner wedding reception fair last weeks focused more his wedding this one more reception . it featured different pics/angles than last week so it not recycled material . katie wedding dream finally coming true ? - now her boyfriend divorce final , america favorite sweetheart free tie knot she couldn't happier !

american girl magazine geared girls aged 7-13 . much younger than many girls aren't reading appropriate level yet . much older they may ready move . but honestly i'm surprised read so many reviews 10 or 11 year old girls who feel they're too old this magazine . i don't believe girls age need magazines based solely makeup tricks , flirting boys , etc . ag articles such dealing relationships friends . like when you your best friend start grow apart . or when she moves away . articles like one girl whose family travels around world their sailboat two years . crafts you actually proud give age 10 . several reviewer complained magazine short expensive . it . but here why : there no advertising ( short anything american girl related ) . many magazines , advertising accounts easily half pages . advertising enables publishers sell magazines low cost . ag no advertising so charge fair price produce it . i'm more than willing pay kind publication . parents ordering your daughters , you know your girl . if you've got 10 year old going 16 , this may not your child . if you precocious 6 year old , she might like it well . ag kind magazine i'm glad my daughters enjoy	1

lot reviewers share similar views , seen recurrence similar criticism today magazines . what these complaints also common they tend fairly uninformed regard certain issues . first off , we all know t+l " affluent travelers . " read publisher description , it tell you just . so if you're not affluent traveler , then don't waste your money t+l stick budget travel . t+l occassionally " affordable " stories , especially their affordable issue march . but don't expect hotels under $200 night . you know why ? because nowadays under $200 night means you're step above youth hostal , especially europe where you pay extra 20% top every dollar today exchange rate . point t+l never positioned itself affordable travel mag , so criticize its shortcomings respect invalid complaint . anyone who claims photography blown out out focus hasn't picked up copy magazine since 1999 . furthermore , if all you saw straightforward photographs hotel rooms , you'd go out your mind boredom . there nothing wrong adding little art your photography , after all photography fact art , t+l pretty good job . so what if there beautiful woman photo . no one saying you look like her or promising she'll strewn across bed your hotel room . use your imagination - this travel photography travel + leisure magazine - it ain't newsweek . all other offensive problems media today , only america people complain too much skin . lastly , readers need understand magazines don't put more ads giggles . magazine business , ad revenue way magazine earns money . so more ads they , more profit they , more money they pay better photographers writers hire more staff more research , etc , etc , etc . no magazine going choose throw away money order not offend its readers fewer ad pages . fact , high ad content indication high circulation , which indication reader satisfaction . more people magazine reaches , more companies want advertise there . fact matter there no perfect travel magazine existence . they either too service heavy , or editorial fluff , or too scientific adventure-y , or just b-level publication . t+l its shortcomings , it its top whatever lists there lot high-end service there . but it stunning its share well written interesting articles	1

subscriber newsweek last 2 years , i'm happy endorse it . topics covered which interest me most involve national/world politics science ; however , i'm pleased discover other subjects covered i wouldn't typically seek out(entertainment , religion , etc . ) . i'm puzzled ranting other negative reviews . while it not perfect , i consider newsweek solid overall its coverage general interest	1
newsweek easy read interesting magazine . however , it not balanced economist or time magazine but come up some interesting articles developments worldwide . if you ignore conservative slant magazine , you enjoy coverage analysis various current world events . newsweek helps me keep up developments diverse range subjects including business society , international affairs , politics , arts other areas . i also appreciate its compact yet comprehensive nature . magazine helps put news into context . instance , i often frustrated during recent israeli-hezbollah conflict lebanon i could see news tv but not understand story behind news . however , after i read conflict newsweek , i got know background going back into decades i could now appreciate all news stories their proper context .	1

this one i subscribe , even though , strictly speaking , magazine better job covering contempo musica mondo . uncut those us who feel nostalgic popular music figures whose stuff held up over time . writing superior , vastly superiour anything print today . this because mag staffed geezers who cut their teeth writing likes nme probably something like top pops back day . writers veterans this good number reasons , among them they bring great perspective , journalistic professionalism , acute insights , otherwise forgotten trivia realization there more life than just listening tunes , i.e. there whole other culture happening simultaneously , their writing . actually , apart feature artist feature , this magazine more film , past present , i love this aspect it because editors choose actor , director , genre or actor/director focus oevre xhosen subject then just lay out whole wackawackapacka stuff you definitely going go out buy/ rent/ borrow view . i always find new movie i just got watch after reading my latest edition uncut . plus , each issue comes complimentary cd . selections these cd spotty i find poor ones i spin through just couple times , good ones , i keep play lots . you won't sorry you subscribed this mag but you likely sorry you didn't if you ever get chance see what you missed not doing so	1

okay , i've read other reviews call this publication shallow , lacking depth , geared toward young teenagers , etc . i guess if you looking twenty page , in-depth technical articles delve into every minute neutron particular subject , then yes , this publication might not what you're looking . but , if you're regular , average , ordinary guy like me ( who would not understand those deep , brainy articles anyway ) you looking entertaining , informative view onto what new what cool , i think you'll pleased . very pleased ! take , example , couple recent issues ( see date when this review written ) . last month focused future personal aviation people behind effort make personal flight more available affordable , aircrafts they inventing . fascinating ! now , i run out build myself prototype after reading articles ? ummm , no . i know whole lot more incredibly fun subject then i before ? yes ! this month issue focuses similar theme : future personal space travel idea space-hotel . when you're reading it you able build rocket fly moon ? course not . but it informative educational exact level i would want it ... just enough make me aware , enlightened , entertained . so all non-nerds , non-rocket scientists , non-brainiacs who want scientific publication people , people , i think your yearly subscription money well spent . enjoy	1

i picked up copy british vogue when i finished reading my american vogue month , interested british vogue its take fashion , plus i've subscriptions british magazines past impressed them . there many , many things set this magazine apart american vogue . first , this magazine main focus fashion . they devote more space models than celebrities , socialites , or noblility types . they don't only focus high unreachable fashions but also feature more affordable clothing ( granted , its mostly british stores , but thought counts ) . articles british vogue more educated , they cover more ground . thing i really liked this magazine not only shows fashions trends but also shows you how put them together , what mixes what , what you should looking getting . they also talk staple pieces this magazine , how where buy those . this magazine also pride country you don't see u.s. anymore which breath fresh air . snootiness american vogue , parading around couture only , $900 first night sets whatnot left out this magazine . it almost seems like this magazine more practical than its american counterpart . lastly , this magazine higher quality , full , glossy pages , glossy cover , overall 2 inches bigger all way around than its american counterpart . this magazine very , very good , i just wish subscription more affordable .	1
i reading history today years . it covers largely european , especially british , history , occasional articles american world history . articles written established scholars sound popular historians , such antonia fraser alison weir , accompanied brief bibliographies . illustrations usually drawn sources contemporary subject article . its only drawback americans price . however , after years freeloading libraries , i decided get subscription . believe me , it worth it .	1
new york review books , new yorker must weekly read me . i read it , cover cover except ads , 45 minutes hour each night before sleep . roger angell baseball best ; lane denby tag teamming movie reviews ; joan acocella dance ( dance ! i've read more it than i've ever seen ) , list goes . left wing ? several reviewers here said magazine left wing . this hilarious . obviously these people never read left wing maqgazine , such comments only illustrate extent which political spectrum us shifted rightward . left wing try : nation , progressive , dissent , or monthly review . new yorker middle brow bourgeois it gets	1
i subscribing new yorker five years now , it very enlightening experience . new yorker its part covering big news stories , but it not really news magazine . perspectives unique ( admittedly lean left ) , kind you're not likely get elsewhere . authors use first person because they tend part stories they're covering . take jon lee anderson , probably most credible reporter covering middle east today . his " letters " various cities involve accounts his meetings locals leaders . other segments more like npr stories -- unique perspectives largely uncovered topics aren't time-sensitive . you'll get in-depth looks into developments medicine , law , architecture , etc ., otherwise wouldn't get your radar unless you profession . , writers incorporate " larger questions " stories focused recent events . like malcolm gladwell recent account playwright who plagiarized material former article written him . he parlayed his personal struggle into good summary legal ethical positions use or development one person idea . i grown look forward reading fiction selection each week . sometimes i don't like piece , but i enjoy getting chance read writers i normally wouldn't those i normally would . additionally , magazine added more dedicated issues -- most recently " food " issue , addition standbys like " style " " fiction " issues . i loved " food " issue , especially one writer account search truly authentic pasta involved work night mario batali kitchen trip italy . i enjoy balance hard news , balanced interest stories , arts new yorker provides . i began my subscription get different perspective than what i got local southern news , i keep it same reasons many more	1

i subscribed multiple photography magazines first when i started getting serious photography . i subscribed ' photography ' ' american photo ' this one , popular photography imaging . three this magazine most balanced amount reviews , ' how tos ' , digital imaging related topics ( photoshop , etc ) well some nice contests . also they seem sponsor more ' mentor series ' type products where you go some locale shoot photos reasonable fee . all magazines this also something important me - half magazine isn't ads . photography worst offender this , there'd 50 or so pages weak articles , then 50 pages solid ads . while this one chunk ads near back , it still ' back page ' article articles mixed among ads . only 25% magazine advertisements . they also support nice online website ( popphoto.com ) forum where people logon ask questions . while not heavily trafficked say dpreview.com authors editors read respond questions . overall great magazine hobby	1

what positives one say ' national geographic ' magazine hasn't said already . ' ng ' american institution appeals individuals thirst multi-culturalism , science , sociology . photography stunning say least . it often said ' best education ' travel far wide see how other cultures live think . since this isn't practical many , next best thing read ' national geographic ' magazine ! addition , fairly recent cover article ' evolution ' well written , convincing , accurate ! myopic , ignorant reviewer below who thinks world revolves around her , who mentioned not into soccer , i say this her : most world loves soccer ( technically called football ) , all nfl , mlb , nba fans combined don't even come close combined numbers soccer fans worldwide ! i am subscriber life	1

i rarely write reviews but couldn't believe what i read other reviewers , most whom focused how ritzy lifestyles parents depicted articles , how " expensive " clothes , how pretty moms ( models ) , etc ... this magazine . don't we expect some kind facade ? other " parenting " magazines may appear more " real " parents , but this no more than their chosen tactic . any publication whose foundational goal sell more advertising , they wouldn't doing this unless they believed it going work . they selling certain " lifestyle " just like child magazine . if it more accordance yours , fine . but why trash just because it different ? child magazine isn't perfect . but least it doesn't pander . anyone really want see what target latest attempt toddler fashion when they open magazine ? i'd rather just check myself next time i'm out buying diapers . if you value solid writing above all else magazine , then child magazine you . ( whether you afford $90 pair toddler shorts page 28 won't such issue . )	1
when i considered subscribing ft last year , i slightly disappointed there wasn't any recent reviews it . so here we go ... i subscribe both wall st journal financial times ( ft ) , past subscribed economist . comparison sake , wsj very good its section one coverage , especially front page stories , political coverage , its excellent frequently quoted editorials . me , other stuff fluff . regarding economist , it highly touted weekly newsmagazine two downfalls ( reasons why i cancelled my subscription ) - it weekly (!) seems interject alot commentary into its stories . which leads us ft . ft , i feel like i'm reading news , more importantly , it daily format , ensuring you'll up date latest global news . there excellent coverage us happenings , europe asia . once you read it , you feel much better informed - where else you get daily extended coverage russian/ukraine natural gas issue or , several months ago , daily coverage germany elections ? excellent reporting comes great , although somewhat left/liberal commentary - don't let dissuade you , however . other gems include business reporting , including stories management ideas , business life , etc .... most excellent weekend edition ( saturday ) , full all sorts cultural stories , including food , wine , arts , book reviews , travel , like . not too mention awesome columns lucy kellaway , martin lukes , tyler brule . you must pick this up indulge yourself few weeks , if you undecided . you not disappointed . reading owning ft must .	1
i enjoyed this magazine kid , but then , i also loved electric company . looking both now , they seem dated tedious , but perhaps our children need something moves slower pace than everything seems now . neither my children ( 5 7 ) enjoyed highlights first , but after getting subscription their grandmother , they discovered joy curling up quiet corner figuring out puzzles stories themselves . it magazine style format encourages reflection absorption , rather than voracious grab go version reading , i believe give child better foundation .

i always avoided parenting magazines : their crowded covers life-or-death information , flash-in-the-pan expert pontificating ( pacifiers dangerous ! not using pacifiers dangerous ! ) , buzz-word-loaded headlines , frantic exclamation points , they unappealing me local evening news . inside those magazines just scattered hectic their covers , nanny , articles themselves , primarily life parent like getting your spouse help out , sex after kids , how get your groove back/feel hip , what toys buy your children next , etc , not really my niche anyway . i subscription martha stewart kids little while , because i liked project ideas ( though i always adapted them make them much less involved ) , but focus magazine become large , elaborate , professionally catered birthday parties , so i dropped i t.t hen , i came across wondertime . while other parenting magazines remind me parents swapping opinions , advice , gripes other parents , this more like what child would tell you if he could : example , what makes playroom truly functional child -an article which begins mother realizing her formal dining room waste space which i wish i could give every family i've ever worked . article " come play me " summer 2006 issue begins " grown-up mean you've outgrown child play ? c'mon , you know you it you . here some playful ideas outing your inner child . " it actually perspective how enjoy it -not tips how cope fact you find it mind-numbingly boring or must endure it necessary " quality time . " article " broom one own " talks how much children love included , helping , doing something themselves . toys mentioned here things like mirrors , sand , water , great outdoors ( sense advertisements here seem really out place ) . i also deeply appreciate magazine attitude towards children learning . other magazines , there abundance advice how ensure you stimulating your children much possible , how manipulate their play exploration , how make everything into language game , everything into quiz , everything into kind lesson which adult charge show puts child through his paces . this magazine , least now , takes approach learning happens . allow it happen allow yourself enjoy around it . i love . i can't wait see third issue	1
