i 3 1/2 year old boxer barks , cries , whines , howls when i go work ... all day ... i know , i recorded it . i went petsmart picked up this gadget . brought it home it manual correct button . she bolted . she hates ultrasonic noise it makes . it reduced amount noise my dog makes but only certain area i don't crate my dog when i'm going away more than 8 hours . so if i'm just running out few hours i stick her her crate this right front her but if i'm going work i use it conjunction petsafe electric shock bark collar . my girlfriends dog not really notice it if he otherwise engaged but my dog hates it . worth price my opinion . best advice take it home try it . some dogs react it . others don't	1

i black fusion my home office ( which next basement-level theater room ) , my wife i already love this machine . we tried all sorts mixes , we've only scratched surface what this machine . this one first times i've so impressed product i wanted write review it . physical properties : it handles travel mugs ( if you remove drip tray , which largely unneeded anyway ) , all our " standard " mugs . drink head moves up down , so it sit flush against rim your mug cut down already rare splashbacks ( more common " frothy " drinks than coffee tea ) . when it brews filterpack , it blows air through end cycle clear it out ( , thus , keep it dripping you remove it ) . water tank could larger ( if only because we're so enamored it we keep making drinks all day long ) , but if you ready source water nearby , it shouldn't problem . tank fits better slides easier than senseo ( which we also ) . flavor-wise : it made mm/mars , so you bet sweeter drinks ( so-called indulgence fare ) excellent . coffee blends quite good , especially darker roasts like " french roast " " sumatra " . lattes made espresso roast taste similar starbucks , moreso than other chains . clean-up : wipe inside drink head , possibly front plastic column ( colored portion ) after any particularly " splashy " drinks . no need worry cleaning up area around machine , especially if you keep drink head rim your mug . course , you can't watch its magic when drink head low , so your first few times , you'll probably get drip here there . final bits : we've senseo since its launch . pods need " pre-wetting " avoid blowing past seal portafilter not-so-great varieties drinks , senseo lagging behind flavia . we drink coffee , tea , espresso drinks , mixed blends , swee t-t ooth-friendly " indulgence " mixes every day flavia , it brain-dead-easy use . certainly easier clean up after , too ! if you're fence flavia other single-cup offerings ( like senseo ) , get flavia . keurig other single-cup offerings can't touch variety drinks you make flavia . i'm sipping lemon/blueberry tea blend now , made over ice , it fantastic . highly recommended	1
like many people , i ignorant neighbors allow their yappy mutt bark . despite talking neighbor politely such , they still no concern noise pollution . i losing sleep , barking getting so bad i even considered moving ! desperation , we looked online something stop barking dogs . we came across viatek super bark stop decided risk money . wow , talk worth money ! my husband affixed device piece wood , staked it 5 feet high our back yard . it unsightly , yes , but we're only ones really see it . more importantly , it right line barking mutt . first time he tested it , he told me dog jumped out its skin ! we laughed gleefully . could good night sleep actually horizon ...? it several days super bark stop worked amazingly . dog lie far it away device ... when it usually lay middle neighbor yard . if it starts yelp little , it stops almost immediately . it if it afraid bark . yay ! you select volume , tone , number barks help eliminate false activation ( say , talking or loud bird squawking ) . audible inaudible both work fine , but we now keep it inaudible two bark setting . device waterproof plastic you need 4 batteries ( not included ) operate it . i am so thankful we found super bark stop ! my nerves really getting jangled i dreading early mornings , when they put mutt outside . it amazing how inconsiderate neighbors ; just because you may want dog doesn't mean i want saddled its noise while you neglect it ! p.s. after using bark stop 2 weeks ( yes , it work ! ) , we noticed neighbors dog started bark bit more . ( not bad before , though . ) we it silent , realized it stopped working . apparently , it not 100% waterproof , despite claims manufacturer . person i bought it said " once it opened , we find it not 100% waterproof " . well guess what ? you gotta open it put batteries it ! either buy faux bird house protect bark stop or house it where it won't get wet . otherwise , you may find yourself same position we . we got refund , fortunately us , our neighbors got rid their dog ... so we didn't bother getting new one	1
