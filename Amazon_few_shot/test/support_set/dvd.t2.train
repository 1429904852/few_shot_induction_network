" con express " lots action it , which great because this hides poor writing uninteresting characters . unfortunately , action isn't enough , stunt pieces shoot-outs , audience tempted doze off . city heat productions isn't really known producing films highest quality , so usually i go easy them . if this big-budget company producing this , i'd inclined pan it entirely . but i wasn't expecting much got little more than i bargained . action , most part , pretty good but nothing competitive your usual dumb action movie . flanery vosloo perfectly casted , but everyone else seems stiff add any more flow movie . vosloo especially appears enjoying himself over-the-top bad guy hijacking train containing deadly chemicals . film moves fast contains shades better movies like under siege 2 , con air , spy game , speed . if you liked those , you probably won't mind this one too much . just go easy it	1
