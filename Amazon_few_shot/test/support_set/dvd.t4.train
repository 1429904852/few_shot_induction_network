my son over 2 before we introduced videos . there definitely those which cater younger baby lots random images , but this one great it puppet shows little plot , well discrete integrated units each seasons . unlike some other be random visuals , here visuals truly support learning objective desired . concur other reviewers well this most robust video bonus features . it both puppet shows short learning video all seasons . no i didn't care commercial either ...	1
season 3 l-word far best ye t.t he character development story come so far since 1st season , even better than season 2 . they scaled back sex little bit , but when they put it , sparks really fly . i love l-word	1
i really enjoyed this film , basically coen bros . homage film noir genre . ( i always thought name funny , since it french , yet most famous directors german , like fritz lang , otto preminger , etc . :-)) . sure hand brothers this material shown how film unfolds cool , unhurried , nonchalant pace experienced private eye or gumshoe doggedly stalking his prey . thornton great lead reticent , phlegmatic barber , if anything , he even more convincing hair than without -- even his hairpiece 50s-ish . :-) whole cast fine job their roles , both gandolfini shaloub couple show-stealing scenes . i found film climax complete surprise , tables turn unexpectedly barber , whom everything seems working out up till then . overall great film probably one coen bros . best . if you're coen bros . fan you won't find this one disappointment .	1

james , you wrote : " ben weak , immature , stalker , lazy , bad taste women 21 unable tell his parents no when they ask him wear scuba suit their family friends . wow ! revolutionary film-making ... not ! " yes , ben weak , immature , bad taste women . his learning overcome his weakness , immaturity , bad taste women , then defy his family elaine family his coming age story . point movie . it went right over your head ! acting dead subject matter shocker when it came out ! how could you not love this movie ? maybe you need grow up little see value . watch it again few years . i think you change your low opinion this great classic movie over time .	1
maybe it because i never read book never heard hunter . thompson before this movie , but i found this movie unbearably boring so utterly pointless ! what point movie-making process while reading script aloud , they realize this isn't movie ? or maybe book couldn't made into commercial movie ? " story " if it called such , apparently journalist his fat hispanic friend ( called his lawyer ) who go las vegas write article some motorcycle race some sort or something . that completely irrelevant , because probably 5-10 minutes actually spent subject , additional 20 minutes most devoted guy actually trying accomplish task . rest just johnny depp main character rambling mindlessly variety subjects , most which deal drugs , or drug-related things . others nothing all anything . they quite literally taking every drug known mankind , movie chronicles them taking drugs . there some scenes which duo their hotel room , where " lawyer " freaks out bathtub threatens kill himself . other scenes , they hotel club , or restaurant . no matter where they , they always high some drug , johnny depp character ( thompson himself based his experience , under fake name ) rambling or talking very very quickly nonsensically . there cameos minor celebrities , some which world famous today . gary busey screen all three or four minutes highway sheriff who sexually harrasses jd character . tobey maguire even less hitchhiker who bails out car when he realizes duo stoned out their mind crazy . only moment which i great laugh beginning , where they hallucinating they attacked bats they drive down desert highway . when " lawyer " stops pick up hitchhiker , jd char says " we can't stop here ! this bat country ! " . line its delivery alone deserve movie its one miserable star . i expected better terry gilliam . if this movie attempting shocking or pro- or anti-drug or stylish or artistic some way , it obviously only most acquired taste , like group people who think consuming waste acquired taste . there no moral message here , nothing pro- or anti-drug , nothing shocking save these two aren't dead third day taking so many drugs , or stylish or artistic . not worst movie ever , but definitely one them . i don't know what orifice people pull this " great movie " idea out , but i'd like examine , find out why	-1
cheesy instructorthe instructor voice covers music background which turns you off going exercize , music itself monotonous beat not inline moves . instructor too fast follow .. cut it short i not recommend this anyone .. totally not professional	-1
off-hand , i can't think worse movie . ( i think nicolas cage some truly awesome work other films -- hey , he making buck , here . ) that all . 1/32 star , if possible	-1
movie title itself says lot , movie itself total scam , fools people rent or watch it . horrible directing , script performance . you'd better jump off empire state building late afternoon if you feel bored than watching this brain-dean bad movie	-1
perhaps this video satisfy readers lincoln various works , such sacred place , messianic legacy , holy blood , holy grail , or least show them places discussed detail within those books . dvd probably fine asset those currently reading aforementioned books . however , it simply not successful stand-alone video or video da vinci code . narrator , mr. lincoln , takes us through quaint beautiful countryside languedoc , home cathar heresy albigensian crusade , points out some interesting details his wandering . yet he rarely ties details together into coherent picture , often makes comments would seem undercut very idea he intends create coherent picture . well , he relishes showing destruction wrought many these mysterious details treasure hunters vandals ( many inspired , it would seem , lincoln books ) repeatedly editorializes against their actions . i finally fell asleep around 90 minute mark --- i cannot imagine what else mr. lincoln could found drone remaining half hour .	-1
