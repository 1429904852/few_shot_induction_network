i like evanovich novels light read few laughs , usually her hero heroine downright combustible - stephanie plum joe morelli relationship , sustained through 12 books so far , case point . but full scoop actually trial get through . i could hear voice there which distracting interrupted evanovich comedic rhythm . whole tone writing down five notches what i come expect evanovich . silly villains either too goofy or too violent , leaving us wondering we supposed amused or frightened ? least forgivable sins committed full scoop fact there absolutely no chemistry maggie zack . none all . so it hard label book : sort but not really romance , almost but not much woman-in-danger .... maybe new genre altogether - slapstick thriller	-1

author great idea , but he cherry-picked available info superman writers get book make sense . example , superman originally written metaphor jews during ww2 . two jewish guys , right end ww2 , write story man leave his homeworld b/c it destroyed ... etc , etc . i'm not critiscizing this book b/c it religious message . i'm critiscizing it b/c author clearly left out clear facts work against his arguement . otherwise , i disagree anybody says it " just comic . " superman often reflected current values attitudes large swath america	-1
