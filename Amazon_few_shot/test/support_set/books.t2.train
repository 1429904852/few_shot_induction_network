refreshing look software development many pitfalls you need avoid . this book should read everybody involved any software project but simplest . my opinion , standard work . nevertheless , it needs handled care . during ages , sw development managers tried convincing their people break out chaos , plan their work . this book correctly warns opposite effects believing planning solves everything . some people might however read lines no planning all best practice . book confirms what i my successful colleagues found through experience intuition : there optimal point planning upfront . less harms because you don't know where you going , more ( too detailed ) harms because it takes away flexibility it slows you down significantly . new me use queuing theory point out what we see every day : too many features , under-resourcing leads far bigger delays than human mind ever guess .	1

it doesn't sound like people you list reasons " not " read this book , actually read " this " book . there big difference , my opinion , putting positive affirmations your mind , versus witch doctor . quite honestly , it seems positive affirmations could should used " conjuction " medical care . it say anywhere book forego medical care , because you most definitely healed ? no where . so my opinion , one " sound " mind , not view book " cure all " all ills life , but rather positive way " enhance " your life . it just plain stupid avoid getting medical care , when you terminal illness , or any other illness matter . but according what i gather book , you use positive affirmations , " believe " you getting well , help keep yourself positive state , rather than filling your head negative thinking you never get well . studies aside this book proven healthy positive attitude mental outlook , wonders recovering patients , their medical care . your review not address any those people read this book , because two examples people you list , it apparent they didn't read book either , ( not sure what compelled you post here ? ) therefore you not qualified , my opinion , critique this book , they using apparently some form faith healing televangelist , they prescribe drinking snakes blood , too ? anyway , this book no way says forgo medical treatment if you sick , those , probably won't addressing their medical problem . positive affirmations power suggestion help you through your medical crisis ? i imagine it , ( studies prove it ) addition proper medical treatment . anyway , you might want actually read book , instead making comments what happened " so so " who didn't even read it or apply it , including yourself .	1

i personally not see how this book could won newbery medal . while author portrays sibling rivalry effectively , only positive aspect this book . fact teenage girl protagonist crush elderly man disgusting presented not only acceptable but understandable . sara family also unsupportive her sulky jealous attitudes . her grandmother busybody consantly antagonizes family . sara twin sister gets all attention love , leaving sara starving parental care . finally , christianity portrayed harsh judgemental . this book could possibly acceptable adults but never children i would not recommend it anyone . i wasted my time this book : please don't waste yours .	-1

i didn't especailly high hopes this book . i think there gradual decline quality hh books over years , this one brings it new low . basically , it waaaaaay too long . 850 pages , it monster read , slow one . that not always bad thing - sometimes if you like characters it nice just hang out your friends page after page . but not here . why it necessary describe detail exact movements treecat using sign language ? several paragraphs ? more than once ? why we given pages liturgy religious services ? i think i'd very small minority when i confess i quite like 1662 prayer book , though i can't quite work out why it would revived distant future when it out use here decades ! maybe it easy cut paste , got word count up . then there space combat - strength series , especially first three or four . but there rub - there only so many ways you describe spaceship blowing up . 11th book series i can't only person out there whose eyes beginning glaze over when we get battle sequences . but big problem - spoiler alert ! - way which weber solves love triangle we left last book . honor loves hamish . emily loves hamish . hamish loves honor emily . what ? it turns out there easy solution . after 400 pages agonising ( not mention most previous book ) it seems honor marry them both . bit outre ? seemingly not - apparently such arrangements fall well within accepted norms manticoran law custom . ( although we've never whiff this before . ) but what really gets me reason it didn't happen halfway through last book ( get this ) , gosh , o-o ne thought it . it seems o-o ne ever told mr weber if you shoot someone gun act , gun better hanging wall act i . all-in-all , i only say , please mr weber . it time bring series end . please it soon	-1
