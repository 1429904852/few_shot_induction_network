**** this comment may contain spoilers ! ***anyone who saw this growing up soft spot their hearts it ; i've encountered enough people over course my 37 yrs who perk up mention it aware its place lot our memories . this satirized simpsons , which proves it embedded itself national pop culture consciousness . anyone who read book its based , incredible " i am legend " richard matheson , knows this film very little common it beyond its intial premise -- even not followed too closely . all criticisms omega man valid : it very dated not all scary or intense some stunts special effects laughably , ludicrously cheesy ; villains -- who should more terrifying than even romero zombies -- just crazed albino hippie luddites last half film , once chuck hooks up rosalind cash kiddies , really let down . but scenes open film heston hefting cool-looking machine gun while decked out austin powers-style finery (!) staring angst old calendar or losing his mind moment hallucinating sound telephones ringing deserted city still pack punch . this second movie , after 1959 world , flesh , devil , successfully pull off eerie effect last living human huge empty city . both films established visual motif streets filled blowing waves newspapers swirling trash . after years seeing this tv -- guaranteed late september or early october event every year few years local tv station during my pacific northwest childhood old dark ages before cable tv videocassette revolution , its nice see this movie dvd beautiful widescreen transfer . it looks sounds great . child i always liked music , particularly " surprise party " theme plays when villains make thir first appearance . it rocks here all its xylophone funky electric organ horns glory	1
my wife i , huge fans `america next top model ' `project runway ' , very excited seeing this film . why it took us this long still baffles me , but friday night we pleasure seeing `the devil wears prada ' let me just say it quite pleasure . now , most if not all praise heaped shoulders meryl streep , while she outstanding , this film more than just meryl painted canvas . there four brilliant performances this film they all deserving praise . first anne hathaway who plays andrea sachs , young aspiring journalist who takes job working miranda priestly assistant `runway magazine ' . anne hathaway proves her performance she all grown up . no , that not take away her more adult roles more adult films like `havoc ' masterpiece `brokeback mountain ' , but here anne proves she adult comedy , not falling back into her teen goofiness made her famous `the princess diaries ' but keeping everything smart mature . she enough poise grace match wits miranda , she so elegantly . next up emily blunt who plays emily , miranda first assistant ( there two , andrea second ) . emily worked her butt off get where she , slaving unruly priestly it all pay off trip alongside miranda paris . only thing standing her way andrea , if andrea fails miserably then it reflects poorly emily . emily blunt turns out i think best performance bunch she enough sass , enough attitude enough wit make her pop out screen stand out no matter who sharing screen her . stanley tucci also wonderfully here nigel , miranda second command . he there make sure everything perfect , also help andrea adjust . stanley always great backup work , playing second hand man just everyone , but here he really makes his performance his own owns it . he delivers some funniest lines film but he never feels like `token gay guy ' ... he needed this film , not filler , he commands his scenes really stands out amidst crowd . then , course , we meryl streep who plays ruthless tyrant known miranda priestly . what i most impressed way meryl underplays every word , every emotion , every scene , which not what i expected . i really expected her go all glen close reincarnate cruella but she didn't ( thankfully ) instead turned out one most inspired performances year . she must fun playing snooty self absorbed above all selfish editor-in-chief `runway ' . she lets us see inside her character briefly ( when crying over failed marriage ) but her character more shutting off feeling order succeed so we don't get see real miranda because we're not supposed . carried these four brilliant performances `the devil wears prada ' fabulous film make you laugh make you smile impress almost anyone . script brilliantly adapted lauren weisberger novel , while it not exact replica ( any adaptations these days ? ) it carries same wit but smoothes things out make it more approachable , my eyes , more enjoyable . bravo	1
this movie full memorable scenes , although it probably more than decade since i last saw it . it suspenseful without gory ... most memorable scene one absolutely chilling without ever showing drop blood . even though i'd read book knew outcome i edge my seat right finish	1
i utterly honest , i don't buy music cds anymore . so many bands hitting streets faster than i imagine , i honestly cannot keep up them all . music begins sound same , corporations seem their pre-determined hit prior public even forming their own opinion . those like simpsons , backstreet boys , even hip-hop artists blending together sound uniform , unoriginal , overly drab . i nearly lost my faith music , retreating some my older music like dmb , counting crows , travis , but then i found ... suns . stumbling around internet i discovered , shockingly , one videos their album called " romantic death " . it one most creative disturbing videos i seen quite some time . then it hit me , i couldn't get this song out my mind . throughout whole day i beat , lyrics , overall sensation song stuck my mind ... i only heard it once . like drug , i needed more . when i returned home evening i found song again couldn't stop listening it . first time long time , i found new band . then , i bought this album . knowing nothing band except " romantic death " song , i put this my dvd player continued impressed . their videos just smart their music . their tracks seem cover every genre music folk , rock , even hard edge . their lyrics seem well-considered , smart voice new generation . my favorites album : " must you "" romantic death " ( parental guidance suggested ) " lost home "" rockstop "" we tried " fact , every time i listen this album i find new song explore , new song jam way work ; new song enjoy ! those skeptical this band , i suggest this album test your tastes . not only it provide songs you burn onto other cds which allow friends family explore this band , but also all their energetic , original videos never see light day mtv , but watched leisure your dvd player . sun breath fresh air music industry this album finally got me out corporate rut seems plaguing this industry . " ... if rockstops , it'll all my fault ... " grade : ***** out *****	1
movie guy , who lot work no fun then feels sorry . that pretty much whole story . well , idea quite powerful but not new , characters " comics " style very primitive , jokes quite boring . actually what really amazing , it could've ok watch family movie , but few really tasteless jokes made it pg13 rated without adding any fun , so movie family values not appropriate kids . too boring adults , not appropriate kids , too much moral young crowd - i can't really think who might like it	-1
i often wonder if some if not most people writing rave reviews , 5 stars , really paid , biased , professionals pumping up movie increased dvd sales .	-1
i saw this movie years ago , but didn't remember much it , except some songs , basic story . i also saw " nights cabiria " , which story taken . i love musicals , i think shirley maclaine very talented . she very sweet charity hope valentine , one can't help wanting happy ending her . so why i think this movie awful ? first all , some dialogue so repetitious it became irritating -- how many times you listen charity say " fickle finger fate " over over without wanting hit mute button ? also , some scenes went -- especially elevator scene . -- intermission totally unnecessary . but worst disappointment me musical numbers . i didn't like any them --- they so far over top silly . bob fosse must thrown everything into them he could --- instead letting dancers songs carry numbers , he so much busyness all them -- too many people , costumes didn't fit story , silly moves -- they all went past point enjoyment . i fast forwarded thrua couple them just get them over . i never before any movie . this could so much better -- story good , charactors good -- but whole thing should toned down . movie could 30 minutes shorter if there some trimming . it entirely too long . also --- all stop action -- what all ? i know , i know -- it show progress story , but it distraction . i didn't like movie glad when it over .	-1
ok , this far most pathetic taping show ( although sweeney todd comes close second ) . where show ?! they cut out " glory " battle scene just actors come out look happy instead creepy like they should when they slow-mo battle scene ( not movie ... ) . also , where " i guess i'll miss man ? " that beautiful song cut movie why ? also what " prayer duck " many others !!! this far worst ladies gentlemen completely ruins show created stephen schwartz great bob fosse ! oh yeah , chita rivera " spread little sunshine " pathetic , players not convince me they creepy really wanted pippin " grand finale . " i this show it greatest show i've ever , but this dvd pathetic . don't waste your money costly price $19.99 , it should $7.99 because how many great songs scenes cut this show	-1
george clooney quentin tarantino got two worst actors all time . it sheer agony watch these nerds pretend macho tough guys . this whole flick akin getting gift-wrapped packagewrapped fanciest wrapping paper ... problem , often case tarantino robert rodriguez , ain't nothin ' inside package . get it ? these guys like worst movies managed become makers some worst movies ever . word shallow comes mind . there nothing there , i doubt there ever . however , said , i must give credit where credit due : juliette lewis , talented juliette lewis , terrific usual . good see harvey keitel his thing , same goes fred williamson , rarely seen michael parks ( this guy , way made some terrific country-type records back 60's--and we wish he'd more . he up there merle haggard my humble opinion ) , last but not least , beautiful salma hayek also this , although she hardly enough . she still curves back then . addition above , we could without all obvious crappy cgi effects end . stuff just doesn't work ; never . way , documentary full -tilt boogie waybetter than main feature .	-1
