shape conforms perfectly designer hands , but unless you share same dna , i'd avoid this product . i've used many these over years this only one i struggled . constantly shifting it get it high low points place tolerable . i finally reversed it , pointing it towards me it worked little better . this just needs simple pad . instead , they've overdesigned it gimmick .	-1
this worst electronics puchase i've ever made . when i first got mini it great , looked nice sounded great . within 6 months battery life started go way down , after year it down nothing , didn't work properly , would show full charge not last more than 20 minutes . if you're going take chance ipod , definitely get newer different model may better quality than this one	-1
i bought this item because amazon never 3m model i wanted stock . so i settled this one . big mistake . wheels this stand only 8 inches apart which makes your cpu very unstable . spring steel friction fit makes it difficult one person attach or remove this stand cpu . it really two person operation . finally , if your cpu side access panel , you remove it stand gain access since stand uses pressure fit hold it computer . take look 3m cs100 stand . i think it much better design	-1
extremely disappointed , especially after lot research read great reviews this product ( axion 7 " player ) received . i bought it my wife road trip she excited large screen ability connect antenna watch tv . player worked fine first dvd we tried , but after screen freaked out went almost black . you couldn't see picture but you could hear movie just fine . no complaints sound i guess , but what good if screen doesn't work ? needless say i returned this fast possible . fact , if i could rate it less than one star i would , since it didn't even last one day . terrible product	-1
i've this phone approx . 9 months now , maybe longer ... i truly don't know how i've stood using this dual phone system so long . however , tonight i've taken giant step " upward " towards better quality design panasonic kx-tg 5432m dual system . this dual handset worst i've ever experienced cordless system . moment i set it up , static atrocious . step away base unit over ten feet it sounds like someone gargling gravel or mad cat hissing your ear . i can't even step into my attached garage talk someone without major static point not even able heard other person . even within six feet base i receive intermittent static becomes obnoxious distracting , not only me , but other person other end ... they hear it too . i never purchase uniden product , if this non-quality product they put out . i 2.4 mhz system would outshine this system ... i wish i'd never gotten rid it . title says ... if you desire lot static when you talk phone , this system you need bring crackling symphony music your ear . melodic consistancy this system creates ones enjoyment talking phone not put you sleep , but rather increase your aggravation dealing what sounds like major electrical storm going inside your head . uniden should ashamed this product . stepping down soapbox now ..	-1
i owned dmr-es40v over 6 months . it combo dvd/vcr unit . i sufficient time become intimately familiar pros cons unit . manual : it imperative manual . this machine somewhat complicated , frequent trips instructions necessary . if everything working correctly , you usually find instructions you need somewhere it . it overly time-consuming though , since items don't seem logically flow . if you dig long hard enough though , they there somewhere . set-up : somewhat experienced setting-up home theater , this generally easy . text pictures sufficient . searching through function menu , i learned perform same action different levels required using different imput buttons . this needlessly confusing . course auto clock set function isn't very accurate ( i haven't seen accurate one yet ) . dvd playback : general playback pretty straight-forward . i really miss some extra playback features my jvc progressive player ( which 3 years older ) . finding scene movie comparatively difficult . zoom feature missing . many convenience features not present . dvd recording : recording onto dvd-ram disc dream compared old fashioned vcr tapes . i really enjoy using them . quirk -- you must unit stand-by record scheduler . this mandates watch recorded show while recording another(on same disc ) you must wait until unit begins recording , then select show watch navigator . uhf tuner some trouble recording somewhat weak signals channel 19 . other weak channels record but not 19 . this problem started 6 months after initial set-up . there annoying bug daylight savings time , newer extended time period . panasonic web site suggests going into set-up menu unchecking dst box ; thus removing feature . if this anything , it would allow you set clock manually . without automatic dst adjustment would not annoying , but even though you turn-off this feature it still resets your clock twice day noon 7pm est . this ruins any tv scheduling you set . this malady persisted until date former dst spring-ahead arrived . several weeks scheduling hell ! i requested assistance customer service but never received telephone call promised . no message , no number call -- just promise call again when i home . vcr use : this feature really buggy . you supposed able eject cassette remote ; but this only worked month or two . when tv show scheduled recording unit won't tape it if you merely insert cassette . it doesn't recognize insertion cassette unless tape made move -- either playing little or fast forwarding/reversing . this really annoying . last impression : last movie ( last king scotland ) i watched took over machine . remote control would not function , disc would not stop , disc could not ejected . it necessary unplug unit , restart it , eject disc , totally reset all menu items -- which randomly reset various settings . worse some settings no longer selectable . one other movie would not even play machine -- forcing me use trusty jvc unit . i must say this machine many same problems still occurring new units what i read this forum other ones . these units released sale way before they ready public consumption . i recommend looking elsewhere .	-1
specs look good . hdmi 1.3 , 1080p , firmware upgrade over ethernet , etc . unit seems solid ( heavy ) well built . however , toshiba chose ship this hd-dvd player only composite a/v cable ( yellow , red , white rca jacks ) box . best resolution you get this cable 480i , not even good s-video connection ! it pretty amazing high-end consumer electronics device which advertised its high-definition capabilities hdmi 1.3 interface shipped without cable set ( component video or hdmi ) actually makes it possible customer connect it hdtv . i don't know how much cost savings toshiba gets out not including cable costs less than $5 . now let get real review : pros : - one best features this unit its capability upscale regular dvds 1080p . upscaling very high quality . unit also various noise reduction options help some poorly mastered dvds . - if weight unit any indication , build quality high . - it ethernet port firmware updates ( possible future functionality)cons : - very slow boot time . takes longer boot than my windows xp pc . - especially durimg 1080p hd-dvd playback , unit gets very hot . make sure your enclosure/rack open back . there somewhat loud fan unit back player . - this player no zoom/scaling functions dealing non-anomorphic dvds , so you use your tvs scaling function . kind pain since image quality suffers when video go through two parallel scalers	-1

things i like : ( 1 ) option tile front keyboard up makes typing much more comfortable . i skeptic it before i purchased it , but really like it . also , this first keyboard i used allows so many typing angles . ( 2 ) included software gives great deal control over customizing all extra keys keyboard . even if you don't windows vista , you program gadgets key suit your needs . ( 3 ) keyboard no lag me , whatsoever . ( 4 ) i'm big fan standard 3x2 key setup home keys , etc . ( 5 ) this small change , but i'm using this setup dell inspiron 6000 laptop . software replaced large volume notifications ( onscreen display showing volume level , mute , etc . ) smaller more attractive style notification . me gusta . ( 6 ) curved keyboard also comfortable . it requires no time nor effort getting used it . ( 7 ) i haven't any problems keyboard " out range . " ( 8 ) mouse , i'm switching wireless intellimouse explorer 3.0 , which also made microsoft , laser 6000 mouse included . this new mouse more comfortable . ( not huge difference , but noticeable . ) it also lighter , slides around little effort . what i don't like :( 1 ) lock key above number pad set default display same two options when you click ' start ' then ' log off windows . ' i would liked option change key shut down / hibernate dialog instead . i haven't found option available , so far . ( 2 ) keyboard little bit wider than others , but i don't find it problem . it just different . additional programmable buttons outweighs downside extra width . five stars	1

i lot research , not wanting rush into anything then regret it after seeing something else week later . i buy newest 40 " 720p samsung $1899 ... then i stumbled upon this one circuit city $1999 bought it spot ... paid $50 delivery it my living room three hours later . i've it week now , i love it . standard-definition picture quality just okay , but any us buying these tvs watch sdtv ? i get 15 hd channels through my cable company , including all four major networks plus espn , espn2 couple music movie channels . therefore , majority everything i watch available hd anyway . sdtv content still looks decent typical viewing distance 10-12 feet . hd content looks awesome ( including black levels ) , my cable provider broadcasts only 720p . i only imagine how good 1080p content going look once it becomes available . i'm going wait year or two high-definition dvd format war play out before i buy blu-ray or hd-dvd player . but i've watched standard-definition dvd my xbox this tv , picture beautiful . i'm sure high-definition dvd would look little better side-by-side comparison , but you not any complaints watching standard-definition dvd this tv . short , this excellent tv , especially compared other 1080p models its size range . if you're looking something range $2000-$2200 , this one you want . enjoy	1

look , bargain-basement product , what you expect ? first , you expect it work , i confirm it definitely work . when plugged usb , it signals xp correctly . driver software very tolerant . you install it any time there never resource conflict or problems system recognizing device . so installation 5 minute process . next comes capture initial encoding . well , software bit lame far features gui . typical . but it absolutely saves mpeg2 / dvd format just you'd need it making dvds all your dish network or ps2 or vhs content . frame rate full 30 fps . it takes svideo or standard rca video signal . both just fine quality . resolutions not great ... but its passable dvd when you crank it up . don't think you encode some blu-ray quality mpeg this though . far overall durability product , i've literally left mine plugged into wall running 1 year straight . it gets hot , but its never so much flickered or needed reset . bottom line ? this thing like kids toy- its cheesy but tough nails . get it your first analog signal mpeg encoder . its good value .	-1

pros : three customizable video profiles ( movies , broadcast tv ... ) ; excellent brightness contrast ; good viewing angles center ; generous input options ; cons : big , centered on/off button cries out my toddler turn it on/off/on/off . finally put 35lb barbell front i t.t he biggest con not tv but dearth hd content . others ' comments broadcast tv looking horrible hd sets cannot overemphasized . same dvds sd dvd players . latter note , buy good upcoverting dvd player ( lt ; $150 ); visual results simply outstanding . also note you need run component video minimum , hdmi preferred ; using s-video or composite complete waste money you spent tv . so other ' con ' you probably need new a/v receiver cables . so recap , if you want good experience , you need hd tv , upconverting dvd player , a/v receiver component or better yet hdmi connections , hd broadcast content ( cable or satellite ) . this not cheap endeavor	1

this little reader fast easy use usb flash drive . pop your card , plug it , wahlah , all your files shown . transfers very fast easy . it uses standard usb cable , so it likely you could use same cable variety devices ( mp3 player , camera , cell phone)the device somewhat flimsy , however front always snaps off when you try open unit rather than working like hinge , it should . this somewhat annoying reattach hinge everytime , so it gets 4 stars . still very good buy , especially price	-1

i bought this recently not knowing much what out market terms tablets , i some advice if you're going buy this product . pros : it shame wacom doesn't make tablets 5x7 since i found out this perfect size- it not so small you no room draw properly , it not big enough you hurt your arm long movements after tiring day work . price- i bought this 20 dollars local radioshack , but you get one much cheaper online compared wacom graphire which 4x5 upwards around 50 us dollars . it compatible almost every graphics software works remarkably well . unless you're professional graphics designer , you won't need any costly wacom tablets if you've got this . cons : when i first unpackaged it , i tearing my hair out two days trying figure out how make this work windows xp . all you out there similar problem , download this driver newer versions windows relax : http://www.compgeeks.com/drivers/kbgeartablet.zip pen sensitivity need set your desired pressure-sensitivity first , so don't try it out before going control panel changing settings . i find best setting use barrel button option left double-click . :) hope helped bit	-1

memorex makes excellent paper sleeve protect cds dvds lying around gathering dust . paper sleeves also particularly good when mailing cds dvd discs because they protect disc while reducing cost postage . it costs less mail cd dvd media paper sleeves than it mail same cds dvds slim jewel cases . this savings alone should make these sleeves pay themselves ! color white neutral doesn't distract you able focus label or other writing cd or dvd . i agree reviewer who notes there hole back sleeve into which you insert flap . this ensures cds dvds don't dislodge when they transit postal system or your car you take them one place . they also useful people who accumulated so many cds dvds store media even slim jewel cases now takes up too much room . overall , these good quality paper sleeves right price . i highly recommend these cd/dvd paper sleeves people who want practical cost-efficient alternative jewel cases .	1
i installed this unit my hp amd 64 x2 19-inch lcd monitor . installation very straightforward , no problems experienced . unit two rows power outlets - eight outlets total . all surge protected , but only one row battery backup . each row includes outlet offset allow transformer power supplies connected still accommodate use other outlets . unit also surge protects incoming telephone line , interacts well transparently my dsl service . unit comes usb connector cable used transfer information unit computer . also included " powerchute personal edition " software . this software replaces ups option used under " power " icon widow xp control panel . powerchute pe allows user selection alarms power options best fit user needs . powerchute pe automatically loads computer startup , resides icon right-side window task bar . it monitors unit status , provides information concerning abnormal power events occurred future reference . order assure there enough battery power this unit operate properly , i only attached pc monitor powered row outlets . transformers seem use lot power , gain most time available adequate shut-down times they should only plugged into " surge only " outlet row . when a/c power fails , unit immediately picks up power load . it then begin shut down pc if a/c power not become available shortly . default method it uses place pc into " hibernation mode " , saving desktop exactly " " future start-up . it accomplished this task my pc perfectly . if i wanted ups keep my computer running several minutes during a/c power outage , this not unit i would purchased . however , keep my system re-booting due power interrupted momentarily , or shut down pc safely should power outage last longer , this cost-effective solution those tasks .	-1

i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1

i just purchased this mouse over weekend retailer but should've gone through amazon it cheaper ... anyway , i am most impressed this mouse . it very accurate , so much so i began see what other surfaces i could move it still accurately move around screen : my chest w/ sweater , my pant leg , my other desk chair didn't hinder mouse any way ! i would highly recommend this mouse laptop users who travel won't necessarily desktop work . lx7 also very comfortable hold - i smaller hands weight solid but not too heavy once you put two aa batteries ( supplied ) . tapered shape height back mouse support hand well . scroll wheel responsive i like side side zoom feature too . it not super loud clicker/grinder type like microsoft mice . tracking very good - photoshop/illustrator cad users take note . extra second function buttons top mouse programmed quick launch settings . finish very good - this top-quality product . logitech it right	1

i purchased this phone it shipped directly my elderly father state . description never indicated batteries required it not come batteries . i known , i would either ordered phone or batteries go it . instead , phone sat 2 weeks waiting one dad caregivers purchase batteries . dad swears it doesn't speakerphone option since i haven't seen phone , i no idea if it correct phone . if it advertised speakerphone capabilities , they not well marked other " big buttons " . i'm disappointed	-1
we found this light very good quality . when purchasing , we also considered similar light black decker . this light seemed sturdier tighter construction . we bought locally , so we option testing these store , before we bought ( they all come packages which allow crank free , so you try them . both models , we discovered some work better than others . what i mean some bd work better than other bd some iluminators work better than others . this may due way they treated store - some used over over again before purchase . it took while , but we found one held charge long time . fact , when i charged it home , it lasted bright light ( three leds ) 1.5 hours kept emitting dim light 12 hours . one bd we purchased ( returned ) stayed only 10 seconds after charged two munutes ( not useful ) . advice : these internet-ordered probably more likely free in-store over-use ( repeat - probably ) . however , you also can't try them before buying . so , like many things you'll need weigh those pros cons . if you get good one , you'll probably agree it very good little flashlight . also - you probably find them locally $15 , so keep mind well .	1

garmin forerunner 305 awesome . it tracks numerous metrics your run including distance , pace , heart rate ( optional hr monitor ) , grade , elevation also real-time averages all these metrics . then docking station you dump all your training info computer software allows you review it things like create courses your workouts . only reason i gave it 4 stars rather than 5 included software leaves bit desired . maps very little detail my case i know they actually incorrect . i know garmin better map since i one their gps units my car it works great knows every little street . forerunner very good product really improved my training	-1
this great dvd player if you want play divx movies or mpeg files burned your computer onto cd-r , dvd-r , dvd+r etc . it plays just every media format any kind blank cd or dvd . it also plays standard store bought dvds just fine . i needed it because all dvds i made home would receive disc error when trying watch them my old toshiba . it connected played fine my 42 " flat screen lcd hdtv . photos burned onto cd also play slide show without connect your camera - very cool . only thing this player i would change would remote control . it looks cool but kinda clunky pointed precisely right spot player or you'll end up pushing button numerous times no effect . otherwise i'm more than satisfied continue use it long time	-1

first , me - i am hp printer bigot , pc user . i bought this printer print labels cds , installed it mac ( which i barely operate ) , so i'm really unfamiliar territory . said , printer software installed no problems . i printed test cd no problem , quality stunning ; significantly better than my hp 950c , which getting old , but still considered photo quality . i'm sure this partially due using 6 colors ink , instead 4 used hp ( i graphic arts background could explain why this , but not here ) . it also printed very fast - photo quality cd label printed less than three minutes . i very concerned this , because i afraid i would wait around 10 minutes per cd , which would made multiple printings very tedious . software designing cd labels great - much better than hp d5160 software , according features reviews i've read ( hp d5160 other printer i looking . it priced same epson r260 ) . replacement claria ink cartridges available all over internet under five dollars each ($5 ) - ignore other posts here , google it yourself . speaking ink costs , when buying printer you need proper mindset : printer free , you're really paying ink . this true virtually all home printers sold today . get used it . so here my summary : pros : outstanding print quality , very fast printing , low cost , good software . cons ( compared hp ): noisier , larger , probably uses more ink than hp .	1
i bought these use my desktop computer system . i spare paradigm subwoofer , so i added setup these things seriously rock out . they blend sub very well , crossed-over sub 100hz . very nice attractive , too . smooth sound , good imaging despite sitting desk two flat-screen monitros them . big sound relatively small size . glad i bought them	1

buyers beware ! i never written or posted consumer rating my life . i am so disappointed vonage overall customer service ; i feel i no choice but warn others . vonage its own words not guarantee quality its service . vonage customers experience : ( 1 ) dropped calls , ( 2 ) garbled communications , ( 3 ) non-responsive dishonest customer service department . reason vonage not guarantee performance because it knows it cannot . my first mistake believing vonage help desk , during my initial , " 30 day money back guarantee period , " when they told me my issues due line quality not vonage . since then , i spent three months vonage my high speed internet service provider technicians attempting make this service work . all speed tests indicate my isp lines fine . i high speed internet technician visit my house last week only tell me everything checks out . all this said , my vonage phone never worked worse . i made call today recipient could not even discern whom i . when i finally threw towel decided vonage not me , i hit $39.99 service charge upon cancellation plus cost phone , despite documented lack performance day one . vonage performance substandard any measure . closely look all other options before bringing vonage into your life definitely terminate all agreements within your first 14 days avoid inevitable early termination fees . make sure you read below clauses vonage terms service agreement before you agree anything . vonage customer service manager , mike , sited these disclaimers when i told him i not satisfied service :( 1 ) " no warranties service , " section 4 , paragraph 4 ; ( 2 ) " return device , " section 2 , paragraph 10 ;( 3 ) " termination fee , " section 3 , paragraph 6 ; and(4 ) " money back guarantee ; limitations conditions , " section 3 , paragraph 7 . when i switched vonage , i simply looking reliable telephone service company stands behind its product supports its customers . vonage lack line reliability poor customer service motivated me document my experience . i call vonage customer service my old fashion landline because voice quality my vonage phone so poor i would not able conversation . after waiting 20 minutes talk service manager , mike , i told i contractually bound because i not terminate my agreement within first 30 days . this moment i thought stereotypical shady used car transaction . i lured buy vonage because promises great service all free bells whistles only " internet calling provide . " instead i received lemon , phone unreliable company not stand behind its product . while vonage may get my $39.99 termination fee cost vonage phone , i not feel i just lay down vonage failure perform . i feel compelled ( 1 ) warn others vonage hopefully save them aggravation i experienced ( 2 ) hit vonage where it hurts , economic pocket book . i am terminating my service soon possible .	-1

i essentially bought onkyo 804 receiver replace 10 year old onkyo model not digital unit ( obviously ) . i currently new sony 5-disc dvd/cd player panasonic dvd recorder directly input , hdmi connections , my 42 " panasonic plasma hdtv . receiver takes digital optical audio output tv ( use video 3 select receiver/remote control ) plays it through my 5.1 speaker system . also , dvd player digital coaxial audio output connects receiver coax input ( use dvd select receiver ) . course , my old onkyo cassette deck connects through regular rca jacks uses onkyo r1 proprietary line connection run cassette deck through receiver remote . note i not even need use receiver 2 hdmi inputs or 1 output this simple scheme . setup menus require using your tv screen , so you temporarily install plain rca video cord receiver monitor out tv convenient front video input jack i . this receiver many listening modes they all sound great . thx cinema mode my favorite . sound separation , particularly movie dialogue out center channel , outstanding . my dvd recorder also plays dvd audio discs , which superb this unit . setup not difficult if you read through manual twice before even starting . microphone speaker initiallization excellent ; works just advertised , you may over-ride any setting manually if you wish . note if you only use 5.1 speaker connections ( not 7.1 ) i , 4th 5th speaker connected side surrounds , not back surrounds ! i kept it simple still use all my original component remotes , if no other reason than they each more options available use than do-it-all receiver remote . i use receiver remote volume , radio tuner channel selector , input mode selector , listening mode selector , that it . money , best receiver i checked into , including some nice denon's! lots power connections . only took 3 days shipping too . unit run hot , so keep nothing top grill .	1

( fairly fast , too ! ) i mean photo-quality . cards look like they just came professional printing house . part excellent design this printer paper isn't folded back over onto itself like hp printers . this means higher bond paper ( like photo papers , business card stock , resume ' paper , other thicker materials ) feeds straight through without getting caught , bound , or jammed ! no more cockeyed , misaligned printing ! no more smudges smears ! print cartridges smaller , but contain single colors -- no more sprinting office depot order four color cartridge because one color empty . buy only what you need . no more throwing away all your magenta yellow ink because cyan empty . scanning seems work well , ocr software contained installation actually translates typed word reasonably well . overall , excellent design . unfortunately , office depot tells me canon discontinued this model .

sony 40v2500 really great hdtv . purchased direct amazon wound up great price free delivery tax free . little patience needed get best possible deal . delivery prompt faster than advertised . if one afford extra price , 1080i only way go . sony states 1080 definitely standard future . i must agree , however , many other customer reviews it little unbelievable remote not universal remote . sony should more than little embarrassed . i just viewed premiere planet earth series full hd it truly spectacular this tv .	1

previous review mentions antennas key good cb setup correct . normal cb user i would recommend either wilson lil ' wil or wilson 500 antenna . both magnetic mount antennas . lil ' wil antenna relatively small antenna it only around $39.00 . actually any wilson cb antenna fine . also , good job setting up your antenna you should purchase swr meter . they not expensive . you only need meter connected inline radio antenna when you adjusting antenna . once you adjusting antenna you take meter out connection connect antenna directly radio . don't fooled cheap ordinary cb antennas like you find radio shack . not settle anything less then wilson antenna . cobra uniden both make fabulous cb radios so either make fine	1

i'm not going pretend say i'm great audiophile , pronounce these phones best ones ever made , because they probably aren't . but they first pair i've bought cost more than $20.00 . i haven't opportunity listen any expensive headphones tell difference . i bought these headphones replace pathetic ear buds came my new mp3 player . i admit i bought them because they look sooo cool ! they light me , they sound good , lot better than my ugly , $20.00 koss headphones . i bought pink pair because skullcandy donates money breast cancer charity . that important me , because my family lost my dear aunt ruth disease last june . i think her every time i slip these comfortable headphones listen my favorite tunes . i don't think these hadphones real serious audiophile , but if you like me , looking upgrade " cheap " pair headphones , look good doing it , go it	-1
i recieved this product christmas , i charged it once since then , listened it 3 - 1 hour rides , 1 - 4 hour ride 1 - 2 1/2 hour ride , batteries still full . 9 half hours nearly non stop battery bar hasn't even moved . i put 1,200 songs it , i still room , i even some 20 minute songs there . earphones kind uncomfortable . wristband allows it carried easily around , although it become uncomfortable after long periods time , because it tends loosen up after while . no artist name previously mentioned ..... you manually imput artist name so i don't know why you're complaining . sound output great , better than ipod , me several friends compared them . all all i highly reccomend this product , it only flaw it size , allows it misplaced very easily	1
i bought phone " worldbargains " // price great it arrived within reasonable time // i buy " worldbargains " again	1

i bought this microphone go one sony minidisc recorders . it very sensative . this , course , good thing - or bad . plugging mic directly into recorder ( without extension ) not worth much because it picks up so much sound unit itself - very distracting . so , one must use included extension move it away uni t.t he mic also very sensative movement ( similar wind noise ) so one really needs just set it out-of-the-way location leave it . even turnig volume unit down ( which operates similar mics " gain " level ) leaves unit very ( you guessed it ... ) sensative nearby noise . i guess ideally i wish two mics weren't quite so omnidirectional	-1

i shocked read previous reviews since my experience totally opposite . my phones don't only work perfectly but they also comfortable , small , clear reception . i've purchased motorola products before they all worked great ( so far least ) . i live apartment where many other wireless devices used my neighbors these phones held their ground just fine ( not like microsoft wireless mouse/keyboard combo i recently bought ) . i also voip service ( voice over ip aka internet phone ) company named broadvoice ( much better cheaper than vonage ) they work great . i really no complaints all this product although some improvements could made ( e.g. internal battery so it doesn't lose time or 2 phone line support would nice , but i'm splitting hairs )	1

i bought this phone cousin ( keypad , answering machine base ) myself six months ago , like it lot . i've since referred it two other people who both histories crappy cordless home phones . they both bought this phone both love it . only identified probems : when recalling caller id number , phone not add 1 out-of-area calls . so cid return feature only works numbers my area code . once great while phone , when picked up off receiver , search not connect giving " out range " message . while this sounds like major problem , it happens rarely fixed simply picking up speaker phone base .	-1

i really no complaints . it simple , clean , looks nice . people complain nothing cover screen but i just took advice manufacturer : " screen area left open . if you concerned screen scratches , you simply cut square plastic package skin comes .

i excited this product couldn't wait get it . got one christmas well ... hmmm . after trying it out couple days i'm pretty dissapointed . i use it usb 2.0 while plate pretty cold , beverage not . i tried it glass , then thinking aluminum would conduct cold better . difference almost negligible . it barely keeps already cold beverage cool ... certainly doesn't cool room temperature beverage even after sitting unit hour . it somewhat cool if volume liquid very low(an inch or less ) rather neat idea just didn't totally come fruition . you're better off just using beverage cozy .	-1
i got this phone because i thought it looked cool thought it would interesting phone talking you talk into different way- this phone , mouthpiece mounted top rotating socket you hold earpiece up your ear . it definitely different look , you see it action - say , person actually using it - fully appreciate aesthetic effect . there few nice things this phone , such braided cord both telephone jack connecting earpiece main part . however , what i think disappointing true purists these phones made out modern , lightweight , cheap-feeling plastic rather than type heavyweight plastic make genuine plastic phones 1920s-1970s feel so substantial comfortable hand . so , i give crosley points just producing such item , it indeed work fully functional telephone fairly well , although what people other end line tell me , drop signal strength distance increases microphone quite steep , indicating microphone perhaps not good choice this device . sum , i think this phone worth price , but know it not necessarily going or feel like real period piece . said , there no wiring problems	-1
i bought this hp ipaq 2795 pda few weeks ago . initially , it intermittently started freeze also couldn't work bluetooth so i called hp customer service . they asked upgrade rom through some online instructions . upgrade deleted all data i saved device i got fresh start again . it worked fine again couple days it froze again while i middle meeting . this time i tried doing hard reset it didn't work . so after meeting it plugged it again cradle ac power pda rebooted again started working fine . again it worked fine day screen froze again . this time nothing getting it out this freezing . i tried hard reset , clean power reset ( described instructions book ) , plugged it cradle applied ac power . it not coming out this freezing . it this state last 4 - 5 days now . i'm highly disappointed quality this pda . i bought one high end model hp i though it'll work fine me . it embarrassing $470 pda behaving like this . one my friend cheap palm tero it never behaved this way . i don't want go through rom upgrade all time loose all my data short-cuts .	-1

i am digital photo junkie - addition taking tons photos i use several programs edit them before i print . problem i ones i end up printing special projects or large format , i don't many regular 4x6 photos around . my older epson stylus photo r300 prints great photos , but just takes too long printing out 4x6 photo albums . end i literally thousands pictures just sit my hard drive . then comes this picturemate snap i just received my birthday . it perfect those everyday pictures ! just pop disk , select photos press print .. out come high quality prints snap ! no computer - no software needed - completely portable . it like turning my digital camera into polaroid . i doubly impressed extra features it , not only viewer but ability zoom , crop , red-eye , add borders , turn bw or sepia few button clicks . it handle carrying very lightweight . i don't plan use this my computer since i two other epson printers already . i would highly recommend this anyone digital camera . only drawback i found so far print packs hard find local stores , you'll want get one right away because supplied pack only print 20 photos . i expect longer snap market , easier packs find . i like they come paper ink set number photos . overall great product	1

i've always found cheapie little ear buds sold airlines order watch their movies utterly useless . besides not fitting my ears ( they fall out ) , even volume turned all way up , i simply couldn't understand movie dialog softer passages over roar aircraft noise . i'd watch other passengers envy while they relaxed comfortably using noise canceling headphones . i decided that what i needed ! when i started shopping pair noise canceling headsets long cross-country flight my wife i going take , i decided even though bose quietcomfort models highly rated , i couldn't justify spending much money something we'd only use maybe 2 or 3 times per year . after lot research looking less expensive alternatives , based features , price , reviews i read , i settled creative labs hn-505 one buy . my wife i recently used this model over 10 hours each cross-country trip we found they worked quiet well ... but few minor shortcomings . interestingly , one leg our trip i opportunity try out bose quietcomfort ii headset passenger sitting next me compare it side-by-side cl hn-505 . here my observations : * cl hn-505 absolutely incredible value money ! i'd definitely buy it again . * fit earcup sort hybrid true " over-the-ear " ( like bose qc ii ) " on-the-ear " design ( like bose qc iii ) . earcups sit part way over ear not completely seal off outside noise . presumably this design makes them more compact less bulky storage . * my wife found earcups bit tight her ears ( squeezing her head ) . she got tired them her head after 3 or 4 hours . careful adjusting headset i didn't this problem . * while they effectively remove " roar " aircraft noise , they their limits . since they only mask noise within certain frequency band up certain volume level , they'll still allow some noise through reduced volume . if you're expecting complete silence when you turn them , then you'll sadly disappointed ! yes you still hear announcements aircraft pa system still faintly hear baby crying back plane , but they effective reduce overall volume all noise tolerable , comfortable level . there very noticeable difference when they're turned off . * soft rushing sound ( almost like white noise ) heard background when turned . this isn't noticeable noisy environment like airline flight . * when i compared bose quietcomfort ii headset cl hn-505 side-by-side , i found bose quieter than cl ... * but * keep mind bose qc ii true " over-the-ear " design whereas cl hn-505 not . i say performance bose qc ii wouldn't convince me pay * ten * times price cl hn-505 * i watched several movies flight found dialog even most quiet passages easy understand . * i like fact cl hn-505 only uses one aaa battery it conveniently hidden head strap ( not cord ) . * on-off switch located rear right earcup within easy reach while wearing , but this same location makes it way too easy accidentally turn it when storing it carry baggage . several times i've gone retrieve my headset it storage bag , only find it turned some unknown length time . good news battery seems last very long time . i've used mine over 10 hours plus time it accidentally only one battery so far , it still going strong . * i'll never again travel without them	1

past two weeks or so i've testing out philips shs3200 clip earbuds . verdict : return . they very , very uncomfortable , even if sound great it doesn't matter if you can't actually use headphones . which means i revert ot my sony pair couple days . i found these big discount only ... three dollars . i needed this pair pretty desperately , or least it would suffice until i found something i'd want major retailer . only other time i've bought earhugger would eh710 over head headphones which i also rated 4 stars , but someone begged me those , so i gave them away . they sounded nice comfortable i also remember getting them discount . these , i wasn't expecting much , just something sounds ok fits well . which actually what you get , except sound bit better than ok . these clip earbuds , much like popular sony . ear . they usual earbuds but clip goes around your ear more comfort more stable fit . that really all you get , but three dollars how earth you expect extras ? it also long five foot cord so it won't awkward walking these your ipod or so your pocket . i've also noticed hook detachable , so if you just want buds then you . sound quality , these don't sound amazing but sound good , especially because price i thought these gonna flat out suck but they're actually pretty darn good . they don't fantastic deep bass , but they full bass what they , making them sound full rich . mids sounded good , not overpowering nor mids lacking , maybe bit much 200-500k range , but it not all bad . these don't amazingly clear sound if that what you're looking , these lack treble little bit , but again price i can't expect stellar sound . i put these little music test , they sounded good my ipod cd player but pretty average itunes unless i tweaked equalizer bit . my stereo system they sounded fine but best when playing cd . they sounded good most my music collection , sounded really good hip-hop , rb , dance , spoken word , light rock . when i turned hard rock or hard hitting rap it sounded kinda tinny , but still listenable . i turned bass boost itunes my other protable audio sources handled all sounded fine , but higher volumes ( more than 80% volume ) things started disort or sound tinny . overall , not amazing sound , pretty good bass average elsewhere . these some darn comfortable headphones me . when i put them i get good fit automatically but those who've never tried these types earbuds before might feel slight discomfort first week use or least it'll feel weird . just know if they're uncomfortable box you should give them least two weeks before returning . something else you should know these come lifetime warranty ! well , course there catch . you send five dollars shipping . relly there not much worth warranty since i found them three dollars , but if you paid more than five dollars it probably good idea keep packaging receipt around . i said , i only paid three dollars these big lots , chances that best price around . price you going get comfortable set clip-buds that'll sound decent last least couple months , maybe more if you're gentle or using these home . you'll probably find these three eight dollars , paying more rip-off since you probably find something better or something extra bells whistles like volume control or waterproof features . overall , not bad set headphones . they don't same sound headphones more than ten dollars but comfortable sound good enough price . good sound , comfortable , inexpensive , check them out ! 4 stars . response earlier review , these don't volume control	-1

returned it , phone kept dropping calls other side house , some times next room , no reception all yard . we used old ( 8-9 years old ) 900mhz phone really good range , could go all over house outside ( even across street ) still get crystal clear reception , but phone dropped too many times stopped working :-( however , even replacement i got ( uniden 5.8 ghz ) not much better far range , we returning one too . so search phone good range continues . i wish someone would make simple phone decent range , i really not care all new bells whistles such color screen , calendars , ring tones etc . all i need basic phone wont drop calls other side house , speaker both handset base , keypad base ( so i make calls without handset ) answering machine 30 minutes recording time ( decent quality , so i understand messages left it ... ) long battery life auto redial . phone book nice but not mandatory	-1

these brush cleaner cd work , believe it or not . perhaps not quite same your system professionally serviced , but why waste more money than you may . this worthy investment look into first - because these work most time ( it always good idea one continued preventative maintenance anyway ) . if you're getting play errors or severe skipping your cd , you might amazed how much one these help . but here few tips those you making audio cd their home computers trouble playing them some machines ... it may not defective or dirty player all . first , it may best turn off any other programs you may running background . this give your cd burner full resources its burning job . also , make sure your screensaver turned off . if it starts up middle job , laser burn may interrupted cause errors . so shut down all other programs screensaver too . second , it may you well defrag your hard drive before starting burn . if you pretty fast pc , this may not big problem , but it may adversely affect read data process if your computer search all over hard drive find pieces media files before burning them disk . i personally auto defrag program installed my computer runs constantly keeping my system running its optimum . third , i recommend not copying cd " fly " ( other words , directly disk disk ) . copy audio files your hard drive first . most cd burning software " create image " option - use then burn image blank cd . if your using nero , just turn off " fly " option music files copy hard disk first then cd automatically . by-the-way , you may want read my review amazon nero . it , my opinion , best burning software available ! since i started using nero , i not know meaning word " coaster " or " frisbee . " fourth , always burn cd dao mode ( disc once ) . this insure there no gap songs(tao - track once - usually leaves 2 second gap songs causes laser stop burning momentarily songs ) , but more importantly , using dao insure laser continues burn constantly throughout whole cd copying process . finally , most importantly ( my opinion ) , make sure you don't burn cd anything faster than 12x ! fact , if you're playing cd older system , burn cd 8x or even slower . if you still trouble , take speed all way down 1 or 2x . it make big difference . yes , i know it means you won't using full potential your zippy 52x burner , but you just figure out what more important - fast burning or able actually listen what your burning ? most newer cd players very little or no problem all playing cd burned computer highest speed ; however , this not often case much older units . general rule it always better burn audio disks slower . you may also want make sure you're using audio cd certified media . may help little bit too . brand media may factor also . sometimes cheaper cd may higher failure rate . i've heard this some people . personally , i not too much trouble cheaper cd ... usually , if steps i already mentioned followed , cheap media work fine . my experience anyway . but different burners may factor well you may want try some different brands media until you find one seems work best you . using quality name brand media probably safe bet may your best course action . good luck ! :	1

i bought this tv after seeing my father-in-law samsung hdtv ( he lns3251d ) . i seen bunch hdtv but i really liked crisp , clear , bright picture samsung . i also loved how light it comparison my 80lb . tube tv . this model little bit cheaper than my father-in-law , but offers same terrific picture ( i believe only difference his comes " piano black " ) . i ordered through amazon ( great price ! free shipping ! ) picked up tv eagle usa instead taking day off work wait them drop it off . they very helpful friendly . when i first got tv i thought something might've wrong it since my picture worse than my previous tv using same directv box . much i adjusted it picture blurry , moving objects left trails picture seemed scroll . however , ever since directv came gave me hd box ( optomized widescreen picture ) installed hd satellite i able appreciate this tv . must-have any sports fan poor eyesight	1

i got these because my old ibm thinkpad laptop " speakers " can't really heard unless you're hovering right over them , i'm not headphone fan ( besides , there nobody disturb ) , quality those built speakers worse than tinny . when i listen streaming video certain web sites , i want park laptop away me something else . hence search external but portable speakers . these indeed come neat storage box everything fits into without you puzzle master . hookup no-brainer , size , sound amazing . i even tried them classical music cd , they fine . " 3d " feature makes them sound like much bigger speakers . supplied usb power cable nice , attached protective cap usb end . controls simple it wake up low volume good design . they're exactly described specs preceding reviews . all i could offer wish list : storage box not something you'd carry around , so i'll probably manufacture simple carrying bag . if you going use it portable player , you wouldn't even need pack input extension power cables , just little dog-bone shaped device itself short input cable tucked neatly inside . speaker part tend drop kerclunk ! base when you unfold it until you know it going . i also noted if you don't little inplut cable carefully tucked into base , speaker part leaves dent cable , which would wearing after while , input cable hardwired into speaker case , so difficult repair/replace . also , i wish there power input cable besides usb cable , so you wouldn't use batteries devices like portable cd players . but i'm very pleased this purchase .	1

i previously owned canon printer time rated high it served well but old photo quality getting worse point where wife getting our photos developed elsewhere . after reading up newer printers i took our flash card store tried it using hp printer . say i amazed would understatement . i went home immediately ordered printer amazon blew away competition price . when i got it i printed photo my wife previously developed shop side side she guess which which but it close she just amazed . i don't know all technical stuff but i know if you looking great photo printer your home you'll hard time beating this one . since we use computer fix print photos i opted 7160 instead 7360 , screen printer not big deal me since they same printer otherwise . if there anything negative say it would advertised printing speed not exactly accurate ( least not quality photo i printing ) but then i don't think any printers advertised . nevertheless , this winner	1

this unit looks nice plays nice , until it doesn't anymore . this piece crap worked only 3 months turned 10x only , it stood my bedroom where i only seldom listen music . it went dead all sudden , sony doesn't honor limited warranty !! apparently , what i ( short circuit , prevents me turning unit ) common defect it even mentioned owner manual ( ie if you get standy flashing , you're trouble ! ) . i several bad experiences sony , this my last . my advice stay panasonics , they're way way way better .	-1
digital technology , monster cable once again ruined marketplace greatly over estimating what their products worth . great difference digital output/inpt devices compared analog simple . if digital signal reaches device it needs it can't any more or less clear . because your digital signal comprised " 0 " " 1 " if you see your tv or hear music then what ever cable you use works- there no distortation across digital signals , so don't pay extra money- fact you shouldn't need spend more than around $30-50 .	-1

i've one these 3 years now , it spent last few months gathering dust . why ? because case design - while nice-looking - not allow proper air circulation or ventilation drive , so it runs much hotter internally than it ought . i replaced drive twice - each one lasted 6-9 months before it failed . i can't think any reason this other than heat . if i use case again , i'll run it without stylish cover	-1

excellent value quality . easy set-up take down . portability factor great going almost anywhere	1
i'm very satisfied unit . it exactly what i expecting it . it works good either 120v or 4-aa battery power . portability very good included travel bag - i it set up work during week bring it home most weekends . also , it takes up very little space so it placed most anywhere . my only complaint volume control . adjust volume you hold +/- buttons loooong time because it changes soooo slowly . also when you turn unit it always reverts same preset volume level no matter what sound level when it turned off . this very annoying times . workaround , i unplug antenna no signal present , i power up altec . then hold - volume loooong time , then plug antenna . if i've guessed correctly , volume lower when signal returns . overall , i would buy same system again	-1
not only lx7 handily svelte when compared many mice similar features , but it ergonomic dream . side-to-side scroll wheel wonderful feature quickly becomes indispensable . back forward buttons placed sensibly facilitate 2-fingered use instead other models ' more cumbersome thumb-buttons . top all this , mouse absolutely miserly when it comes power use . so much so , fact , i've using mine only single aa battery place . my two niggling irritations ? fact battery sensor tells only when your batteries dead or dying one . but i'll give based aforementioned efficiency . secondly , logitech setpoint pre-programmed button mappings take some retooling get mouse working more than few common applications . that okay me too ; i like they allow you control change them least . all all excellent product .	1

radio very easy use excellect reception , even antenna folded up . while not shortfall radio , rather noaa/nws system , county areas too big . example tornado warning issued this past weeked ; while nearly sunny my location , warning came out weather issue miles away , but still same county . also , plan batteries available when running off 110v battery drain high . i think this caused because weather radio always listening emergency tones . overall very good value i would suggest one every home	1

i've owned creative zen ipods , but nothing touch this thing . if you nice home or car stereo equipment , this player . first , it plays cd quality ( flac ) lossless files , so instead compressing your music sorry mp3 format average 192 kbps you listen music it intended 1411 kbps . many say there no difference , but plug this thing into your home receiver or car stereo you definitely hear it . second , ( very important me ) , you bypass itunes or any other memory resident programs designed " help " load your music into your player - just plug cowon into your computer usb port it becomes additional drive . you then drag drop your files - it simple . it well build , solid feel it . it line-in recording jack wich come handy . it play videos , also . screen small watching movie it ( approx 1 7/8 " ) , but i not watch movies this or any other player screen . even 3 " too small ! time when nobody owns anything smaller than 40 " hd flatscreen why world would you want watch movie little thing ?? anyway , me personally simplicity superior sound quality what i look such gadget . now , i not use my home system cd player any more : i plug this thing into my receiver access my collection high definition music cd quality . i get my car , same thing . no more cd lose , scratch , destroy or forget where i put them . they all archived both my computer drive cowon . it sad see this , but we're all flocking buy products like ipod zune which nothing but impose more more restrictions upon us : buy ( or should i say , rent ) music only their sites , use only their sorry proprietary formats , force us use their proprietary itunes such programs , which invade , crash slow down your computer so forth . not mention zune , which not even play window media files !!!. conclusion , this product definitely worth looking . it gives you freedom flexibility lot things your music .	1
i run this alarm my expedition last 4 years . it true these remotes require some extra care , they provide you wealth knowledge your vehicle situation while you indoors . compatible only top line d.e.i. alarms ( viper included ) . this 2 way remote let me know commands i sent received . it alleviates lot guesswork . glance , i know if my doors locked/unlocked , if car running ( remote start ) or not . if alarm triggered , it even shows me zone triggered when alarm tripped ( it actually shows which door/window opened/broken , or if car hit ) . i too bought replacement remotes this alram , but i knew what i getting into when i bought it start . those you who don't need 2-way function , its important know you program one-way remotes ( much less expensive ) work alarm brain too . i strongly suggest extra remotes every alarm . you should also know locate your valet button case you bypass alarm without ( working ) remote . when you drop computer , its roll dice if it keep working , or not . i've run this alarm 4 years , drop my keys regularly , only needed replace two remotes . i too found customer service joke dei , solve problem my own . but alarm itself great ! hope this helps	-1

i'd like start asking why some you given this system bad reviews because you couldn't hook your computer or whatever up correctly . don't punish product because lack research your part ! download manual or read product description - it clearly states " control module features standard analog stereo audio input two digital audio inputs -- one coaxial one toslink optical . " there no mention multichannel analog inputs , so if you don't optical or coaxial digital outputs , don't buy it ! or , what i ... purchase creative soundblaster mp3+ . this little device attaches your computer via usb allows output ( input ) pure optical digital stream . hook optical cable it klipsch disk voila , dolby digital your computer . external soundblaster live !, soundblaster audigy 2 , philips aurilium also work . system itself . i also creative t5400 , but i wanted something dolby digital decoder so i could hook them up my laptop cheap home theatre setup . i bought this klipsch sale $130 , it fits bill . some complain hiss - i'm experiencing noise too , but it more whine slight bit hiss , more pronounced when i'm using analog input . it might due electrical quality , too ... my creatives never hissed school , but my new apartment , i get noise through them . noisy electrical power outlets cause problems . i think sound pretty good . nothing spectacular , but what i expected . clear good off-axis sound ... mine ten feet away , i get better soundstage without tip-in . sub really good job so small - i put mine corner , it'll move couch . i find it too much music usually , so i turn it down 0 , up +4 movies . system could use more power my application ( decent sized room ) , but that not really what it made . so i'll forgive system . i like assortment processing - native format ( dd 5.1 or 2.1 channel stereo ) , 5.1 stereo , two types dolby pro logic ii , which i'm fan . latter gives good 5.1 sound stereo source , without too overbearing . range adjustment center , surrounds , sub nice , o.o ne thing i really wished system remote control . it couldn't expensive incorporate , would nice touch . i know i could put control disk my table , but i don't want cord running across floor . bottom line , if you're going purchase this , realistic . it not going best system world , but it decent , cheap way get dolby digital or pro logic ii decoding computer , game console , or stereo source . make sure you connect it before purchase , you'll ok . i'll give it four stars somewhat noisy , lack remote , fact i don't think it should cost $300 retail	-1

i looking card i could use easily gnu/linux without trying emulate windows drivers . i'd read this possible this card so i decided try it out . i'm running debian 2.6.17 kernel . all it took following : download madwifi ( free , open source ) , extract program , run ' make ' , ' make install ' , then ' modprobe ath_pci ' . using knetworkmanager you then connect any detected networks easily switch wired wireless networks . it seems work very well so far . i not tested card windows , although since it designed windows yet works well linux i only assume it work least well windows . according very simple-looking quick start guide , windows users need only insert cd , go through standard install wizard , plug card it work . i used belkin products past never disappointed ; it doesn't seem like this product break chain	1

i bought this november ' 05 so i've bit time get familiar product . overall this great receiver someone looking most bang buck . next higher this series ( de998 i think ) practically exact same features , maybe 10 watts more per channel , so my opinion not worth difference price this version . setup annoying ( but not impossible ) . you push buttons turn setup knob all while reading tiny lcd display . several times during setup i would get desired setting , read more manual , time i got back unit setup mode disappeared . course this awkwardness disappears you become more familiar machine . on-screen programming setup one features not included this machine -- but remember how much you paid ! remote very annoying small buttons confusing setup instructions . i programmed it control my dvd player , tv , cable box vcr . once while it " forgets " how talk cable box some reason , or gets confused which component ( e.g. , cable box or dvd player ) it talking . this doesn't happen often but it happened two or three times . fortunately setup not last forever this not exercise you doing machine daily basis . also , most time remote correctly remembers which component it supposed talking . said , sound quality fantastic ! this machine shake walls sound if you turn it up far enough . i not normally listen my music this deafening volume most time but if i am real headbanger mood it happen . when using receiver very high volumes it get hot , not just warm . keep this mind when you place unit , it alot vents top unit . unit convert composite inputs s-video output , which not clear reading manual . i bought this athena 15345 point 5 mkii system home theater speaker package audiosource psw100 10 inch powered subwoofer . this fills livingroom sound quite nicely . also those us who still turntables , you hook yours up this machine -- feature lacking most other units i considered . if i thousands dollars my disposal looking absolute best receiver i would course get something else . although less-than-perfect setup routine remote , this unit produces exceptional sound acceptable price i would recommend it anyone looking great sounding receiver affordable price	-1

i going get oppo upconverting dvd player , since i large collection standard dvds wanted wait out high def dvd war , but only $150 more than oppo five free hd-dvds boot , i figured i would go hd-a2 : i not dissappointed . i leary how good upconverting quality would , but no more . i am really impressed ! my superbit copy fifth element looked amazing ( incredibles lord rings ) . i left my old sony dvd player hooked up same time watched same movie via standard then hd-a2 . i not think same movie could look so much better simply upconverting . sharpness color detail looked much better . this player give new life my standard dvds . powering unit loading dvd little slow , but not point it issue . i am hooking this up via hdmi mitsubishi lt-37132 ( 37 " 1080p lcd tv ) . no complaints all . fact , price dropped $55 right after i bought it amazon refunded $55 so player less than $100 more than oppo . after i get my five free hd-dvds it certainly better deal	1

although hp laserjet 13x ( q2613x ) costs 20% more than laserjet 13a ( q2613a ) , it superior buy number reasons . topping list lower cost per page . 13x print 4000 pages 5% page coverage ( iso/iec 19752 standard ) whereas 13a print 2500 pages . that 37.5% difference page yield . divide up toner price against 4000 ( e.g. , 91.99 / 4000 = 2.3 cents ) get cost per page . secondly , laser toners last long time whether you print few times month or dozens pages day ( they don't dry out ) . finally , higher page yield means fewer toner replacement . my only complaint 13x ( goes 13a well ) page yield cost some competing printers higher-end hp laserjets even less	-1

if you college student , or anyone who deals math , i highly recommend you purchase this calculator . it excellent tool performing many types calculations both algebra , seemingly , calculus , although i only used it algebra so far . unlike other , disappointing graphing calculators , this one permits you use undefined variables ( i.e. , ' ' stands nothing except ' ' unless you want it , which immensely helpful performing algebraic calculations . ) qwerty keypad also makes entering expressions pleasure , rather than chore ; this more than academic point when you test time-limit , hitting ' alpha ' key before typing every variable depicted letter ( , , , , etc . ) use up precious time maybe ensure you don't get all problems . there too many easy-to-use incredibly convenient features this calc list here ; but it truly worth hefty price tag . my only gripes manual sometimes bit obscure ( though it easy comprehend compared most graphing calc manuals ) calc no nthroot function i find , , find cube root number you enter it x^1/3 . these very minor points , though , splendid product	1
not any problems yet . i needed more space store 5 years worth pics , may buy . much better than carrying around 4 1gb thumb drives	1

what great product !!! well designed , fast response times , all items you need included ( bike car mounts etc ) wider screen would nice , but this their first generation motorcycle gps(i guess zumo 650 next ) . over all , fantastic usefull addition my bike car . it kind like ipod , very easy use but very sophisticated .	1
i just looking something listen music while i worked out . this player very basic , but money exactl what it says . it holds enough songs get me through 2 1/2 hour routine . sounds pretty good very easy work . couple drawbacks : headphones come it very short cord battery runs down pretty fast ( usually replace it once week , so i guess it run 10 hours total before it needs new battery ) . other than it looks pretty cool very small ( fits my pocket while i walk around ) .	1
works great no issues . small amout sound fan . i using this past 10 months no complaints , it worked without any issues all . i would definately recommend it	1
i recently bought iaudio 6 am so far very pleased its superior performance . i owned 60gb ipod am convinced former way better than latter . first , iaudio 6 superb sound ( 36ohm ) , its hard drive although small , considerably fast . i love fm tuner well voice recorder extremely convenient small but very robustly built mp3 player ; those features unavailable ipod . finally , price/quality very favorable . this my first product cowon/iaudio , but i definitely buy again	1
i used garmin it great . just put where you going it talks you all way my destination	1

please not waste your time or money this item , unless you money burn . don't get me wrong , car charger part kit great , but modulator radio frequency horrible . it provides substandard sound , no matter what format you your audio . i tried multiple frequencies , multiple formats , every setting zune itself , it just horrible . i am returning mine asap . i cannot justify spending 70 bucks such terrible item . hope this helps someone else	-1

i've owned e3c last two years let me say they best sounding earphones ( or headphones ) i'd heard up until point . anyhow , they went defective me few months ago rather than fork out $70 get them repaired since they now out 2yr warranty period ( shure replace them free during warranty no hassle whatsoever , way ) i decided plunk down cash e500 . i got them cheap , because how i roll , but they're worth retail how good they . you may already know now e3c single-driver phones they blow away any standard fare your neighborhood electronics store . also , you might wondering , like i , just how much better triple-driver phones than single-driver ones ... whether they're worth hundreds dollars more they cost . assuming one appreciates music sound quality enough spend decent money phones first place , let me say i taken risk you , homework you put word out streets , er , well , online review , anyway , you : e500 killer . you'd better ask somebody . drop your concerns . these worth hundreds dollars more than single-driver phones , if you care enough notice difference . i listen lot jazz fusion fast , popping baselines , drumming smallest fractions beats you imagine synth work match . e500 , i'm actually able hear detail not come through e3c . when i say detail , i'm talking synth chords drums those fractional beats i literally not even realize present albums i've owned 10+ years . bass , it somewhat deficient e3c compared these . i dealt two years because they sounded better than anything i could buy store despite . only single driver both treble bass , e3c best they they fantastic , given what they . e500 , however , their two bass drivers single treble driver each phone , pose no compromise listener . read again ; it strong statement . believe you're getting something real what these cost . bass strong deep , drums , tight airy , mid-ranges `meat potatoes ' your soundscape , fat loud , accuracy devastating . we're talking sound literally gives me chills times . e500 comfort issue me first ; small ears , i initially found them less comfortable than e3c since housing these considerably larger order accommodate three drivers . now , after three months using these , they almost comfortable me e3c . i would say i need take them out after 30-40 minutes sake earlobe comfort , but , all fairness , i usually need take them out other reasons way more often tha t.t he pth ( push-to-hear ) module joke . i guess it works , sort . you try it out thirty seconds , curse fact some portion dough you spent these phones went towards this nonsense , put it back box , never use it again . thankfully , you not use it since it separates phones nicely . shame shure forcing people buy this stupid , worthless accessory , insulting intelligence people who appreciate good sound not realizing how unprofessional it package this crut expensive , high-end earphones . i won't even get into fact `pth ' part earphone model name . someone should get fired this debacle , seriously . lexus probably wouldn't force you buy fuzzy dice hydraulics ls460 , those things cool boot . earphones themselves still bomb	1
just got this product my birthday , because armband came my nano too small fit around my upper arm . after reading review inalaska , i decided give this one try i am close same size ( 5'11 " 225lb ) . item just described his review , my thoughts pretty much same ( my screen protector not damaged ) . package good value 90% people who purchase it very pleased . unfortunately , i'm minority , because it still too small fit comfortably around my upper arm . if your upper arm 17 " or larger , armband not fit unless you pull it uncomfortably tight ( cutting off circulation ) . i'm going try stretch it see if it eventually lengthen . if it works , i'll amend this review . still , solid 4 stars quality value .	-1

i really like this tv . good : sd performance good . digital processor top noch . hd picture good any . i'm satisfied contras t.t here lot input options . hd tuner pretty good . i'm only using $3 rabbit ears get all major hd channels solid signal strength ( most transmitters 20-30 miles away ) . great price name brand . amazon delivery fast courteous . not so good features minor , but i'll list them incase it helps reader decide : no qam tuner . remote/ir reciever not great . there times i push buttons remote tv doesn't respond . you need point remote lower right corner tv best response . clunky menu navigation ( function buttons remote help , though)univ . remote no codes dvrs ( tivo/replaytv )	-1

i bought pair january loved them . sound lovely everyone describes . however , there something seriously lacking build quality . soft wires felt flimsy me when i first opened it , but i thought i'd just take extra care . 1 month careful usage , plastic-covered wires earbuds downwards became so weather-hardened i could almost use them chopsticks , makes it so earbuds popped out slightest motion . 2 months careful usage , wires half-ripped plug -- which i repaired best i could unsightly electrical tape . however , 3rd month , left bud fell completely off . i am very disappointed -- it one best-sounding phones i've ever ( i've owned both grado s60 s90 , sennheisers ) , but man , they need something making this baby last	-1

i've using this switch 3 months now not single issue . it very easy use . both keyboard controls manual switching work great . i would definitely recommend this switch others	1
both items worked well . light sufficiently bright light up keyboard effectively , while not too glaring , fan worked silently expectedly light breeze . main problem this item price . $17 , desk lamp would provide far more illumination than small usb light . likewise , one could purchase fan lamp less than $20 . stated this , fan/usb light combination perfect when working room where lights necessarily dimmed , such when presenting speech/presentation . i using light around two hours day past 6 months am pleased find manufacturer claims regard led longevity holding true . conclusion , while both products worked perfectly , they really limited use suitable only those who spend long hours where darkened environment necessity .	-1
hi . i find this product very good , but also could find features need improvement . first all , i bought this stuff last year returned it because our laptops couldn't recognize it netwrok . later , i remembered xp sp2 patches installed our machines just before i tried use keyspan server . since sp2 automatically turns xp firewall function , our laptops perhaps failed recognize usb server because this . i wasn't wrong . when i re-bought installed usb server later , i reconfigured security options xp my laptops so firewall doesn't block port used usb server . voila , i could see list usb equipments connected this little gizm o.o nce i configured it right , i found out this thing very convenient just everything . here my equipments attached it : cdrw , fdd , external hdd , printer . all these gadgets working seamlessly now . however , besides above configuration problem , i experienced one or two problems so far . ( if i haven't , i would've given 5 stars this stuff . ) when my epson 5200 all-in-one died clogging problem i purchased lexmark 5270 , autoconnect function keyspan usb server didn't work new all-in-one very well . i strongly suspect it because lexmark poor device driver ; however , it true keyspan usb server incompatible some all-in-ones . i returned lexmark 5270 bought epson stylus c82 . matter fact , i believe usually this goes epson printers all-in-ones . bottom line : i recomment this machine anyone who wants more than one pc usb equipments . however , you need check your pcs ' firewall configuration , when you buy this stuff or buy usb equipment , keep your receipt week or two . you may return this stuff or , if you already one , your new usb gizmo because compatibility issues	-1
i originally purchased this printer our phone server work . i hoping newer design would install without making me reboot system ( it didn't ) . picture quality typical epson , i'm very happy it . i just print occasional color graph or chart , it rocks . it quiet , it small , it takes readily available ink . cartridges newer sepperate component type cartridge . it doesn't like cheap copy paper , jam eventually . it easy unjam clear however , i able slip my ape like hands down into printer , without curse , scream or apply band-aid .	-1
i used most gaming mice released since year 2000 . prior deathadder , my mouse choice logitech g5 . i am not going bash either mouse . both very good . however , i prefer deathadder more . ( note : make sure you upgrade firmware . this make difference lift off issue some people complained about)after tweaking sensitivity where i like it , i noticed deathadder feels more smooth accurate than g5 . i am not sure if it 1000hz polling or sensor , but something feels very right it . only movement issue i getting used lift off height . new firmware improves this lot . however , it took couple days train myself lift mouse slighlty higher , but i am completely used it now . i think g5 might initially more user friendly here , but it only takes matter few days get used deathadder . other items feel " right " me side buttons . they seem perfectly balanced just right amount pressure make it easy depress , but tough enough not accidently press them . i really don't care " back " " forward " internet explorer . i just want usable buttons bind inventory items games . g5 bit let down there only one , reasonably hard button depress . scroll wheel my opinion better than g5 . deathadder again seems like razer found perfect compromise scroll click feel . however , like most mice , scroll wheel button really not option high intensity online game . deathadder might little less usable than g5 since wheel smoother , but i found myself scrolling down while trying depress button . so i don't really use it now , i just wanted give it shot . one thing g5 side side scrolling . however , i never really use anyway , even spreadsheets , so there no negative points my book . however , if you rely this feature , this mouse might not you . terms comfort , i big hand i find deathadder more comfortable play games over long period time . i rest my palm top more instead hovering it off back i g5 . terms craftmanship , i would say i am pleased . mouse feels well built very solid . i would say it par logitech build quality ( except g7 , don't get me started stalling , freezing , totally not " bullet proof connectivity " pos ) . considering looks , deathadder really attractive person . it reminds me exotic sportscar . my g5 silver , rust colored black . it not terrible , but deathadder more sleek refined . i see little iconic razer boomslang 2000 shape it too . i find pulsing blue logo really cool too . it so happens my case black blue leds inside my keyboard g15 so deathadder matches my color scheme . overall , razer winner this death adder . me , it feels just right it very smooth accurate . after couple days , i am used it loving it . if you g5 happy it , you probably don't need buy this one . if your like me like try new things , this might perfect mouse you try .	1
possibly worst design armband . fifth-grader could make better armband felt , velcro , scissors some thread . not only you not see nano screen , or adjust volume while you running ( changing volume like trying text message gloves ) , but you cannot adjust tightness band just one hand , it too little elesticity too small velcro strip . top it off , nano kinda difficult get out band .	-1

most good excellent ctr channel speakers cost you more . $250 - 300 highest rated ( cr ) not unusual . i bought cambridge soundworks mc150 , under sales misimpression it " center " channel speaker . no . so off i went see if this still shelf open box special . glad it . i tested it speaker listening room , it master commander justice . comparison , i tried out some music selections bose 161s ( where superb sl sr surround speakers ) , they clear precise highs , sufficient bass most center channel needs . then sales guy i hooked up ns-c444 one channels , played same selections . yamaha compared favorably . now you might thinking , hey , it only center channel , what it got other than just dialog lef t-t o-right transition . not simple , friend . center channel one speaker your home theatre always doing something , always providing sound . you want capable one . you also want one excellent dynamic response clarity . case point : scene when capt ramius addresses his crew after submerging hunt red october . you hear connery voice foreground , then over 1mc intercom circuit , then booming across sub bridge . example : obi-wan talking dex star wars episode ii . if center channel inferior , he dex sound like they're chatting inside box . if center speaker up standard your left right speakers , they sound full rich " present " ( right there your living room ) . point ponder : if you watch old , monaural pictures some stereo dsp , lot soundtrack come your center speaker . quick test scenes like this : switch your receiver " 2 channel stereo " ( or mode mixes down dolby/dts 5.1 lf rf speakers ) , then switch 5.1 decoding . voices sound same ? pick good center channel your home theatre benefit immensely . i think this one excellent . consumer reports lists couple other good bets you find lt ; $200 . happy hunting ...	1

this great little unit client pvr such beyondtv or sage - i use sagetv my house 3 these clients running free plug specific sage . they work great , picture super , since there no moving parts or excessive heat they're completely silent - they work perfectly . i don't think i'd get one run just stand alone it fetching media pictures such off remote computers - application comes it not greatest . but since i'm using sage interface , no problems . only downside , although it small one , response remote just little sluggish - not bad , but aware when you hit " skip ahead " button when watching recorded tv program it'll lag , perhaps , half second . i've gotten used it don't mind all . since i automatic commercial skip sage , i rarely use it anyway	-1

my old alarm clock radio recently bit dust , so i started search upgrade . i initially looked bose , but stumbled upon sangean radios . i usually listen npr jazz evening , sangean seemed fit bill . plus , i really like design . price . amazon got it me 3 days free shipping , i haven't disappointed radio performance . it great sound , remote control great other side bed ( when you don't want reach over your partner turn it off ) . couple things consider , however . backlight readout adjustable , but lowest setting bit bright dark room . fortunately , brightness control right front . i just turn off backlight before drifting off sleep . backlight also separate setting when radio " off " " . " thing . radio not display time when it . this so broadcast digital data display while playing ( e.g. , stations data broadcasting , display scrolls name station , title song , etc . ) . it would nice see time when you wake up ( after you hit snooze few times ) , but it not big deal . just touch " display " button front , radio switches display time . we also analog clock opposite bedside table . yes , there snooze function ( 5 min . ) , although product info doesn't mention it . you activate it touching any buttons front . sangean also thoughtfully designed alarm volume gradually increase it comes , so you aren't jolted awake . all said , i would recommend this radio . it looks great performs well . price , i'd say it great buy	1

i really wanted like this phone all good reviews , but received one issues , returned it received same issues ; so it must phone model . below items not involve using handset speakerphone feature which requires " wait you " " wait me " behavior ; just normal handset . -when you first answer incoming call , you usually wait few seconds phone make available 2 way converstion ; otherwise , you say hello caller can't hear you you can't hear them . -during call using normal handset , background noise even regular conversation cause phone block volume caller though you using speakerphone feature when you're actually not . after few seconds volume become audible again . this issue causes bits pieces conversation go unheard . this happens more long distance calls than local calls	-1
when my first shredder finally bit dust ( fellowes ) , i wanted upgrade more commercial series last longer , i spent 4-5 hours online researching shredders . fellowes kept coming top list customer comments ( price ) . i loved my earlier home office version ( which lasted 6 years moderate shredding until large hidden paperclip it ) so i'm partial fellowes anyway . but i looked everything out there . i didn't want spend fortune , but i wanted high quality metal parts . i also wanted move confetti type ; strip shredder filled up trashcan too often . this sb-97c it ! love it ! really grinds through everything - don't open up junk mail anymore . i shred through old tax files quickly - top piece provides " guide " so you know how much paper go through shredder once . it also guide cds credit cards i've found very handy . slide out trashcan really holds lot paper . it comes some oil few bags - very nice them include these get you started . i've only this month but i've shredded good amount paper it wonderful . price i highly recommend it	1

after close ten years using hp 4l , ( which still works perfectly ) , i decided look printer larger paper reserve higher speed . i've thrilled p2015dn . speed incredible , paper tray holds 250 sheets , front unit small indicator approximate amount paper left tray . 32 mb standard memory means big print job , even if paper runs out middle printing , it remember print remainder job . here great thing ... this model p2015 unit network ready built-in print server . i small network server connecting 2 computers wireless router our laptops . my 4l connected print server parallel cable . choosing this unit , all i use j45 ethernet cable , plug one end into one my ethernet hub empty ports , other end into back printer . install drivers each computer ( not server ) , you instantly business . just choose p2015dn your default printer each computer . i kept my existing setup my 4l backup printer just case . ) really nice surprise my ethernet hub old 10base-t , yet p2015dn still fires out each page blinding speed . machine doesn't make sound until it processed job , then starts firing pages out . duplexing works perfectly . extra money spent this dn model payed simplicity installation . there no operating manual comes box . there only installation disk . manual found hp web site . my only problem install instructions they tell you not turn machine until install complete , but it can't find machine network complete install unless machine , software not tell you specific point turn machine . so leap faith , i turned machine , it found network , install finished nicely . during install , it tell you it reboot your machine , so don't anything open while doing install . overall , based my experience my old 4l , current performance my new p2015dn , i look forward many years trouble free service . you tell i'm hp fan . yes , you find cheaper makes models same , but me , hp only dependable brand . i only say based personal experience ... i understand others may feel differently . good luck your printer purchase .	1

i wasn't exactly sure what think these speakers first . my setup includes pair these speakers , connected 6.5 " klipsch woofer ( gmx-a 2.1 ) $99 , i wasn't sure if i would get much more performance than stock sattelites klipsch 2.1 ; however , i'm very impressed after few days adjust differences sound . ( klipsch much more bright sounding , i liked , i adjusted equalizer my computer slightly more treble . after , i would say these speakers sound great any way you listen them ) . my personal opinion they sounded somewhat flat their own . i'm not sure how woofer attached would alter sound , but they seem nicely rounded their own . recommended anyone looking great price mid-range component .	1
i like design headset . it lightweight . way headset hangs your ear might feel little weird time time , but if you playing game your pc using this device voice comm you would probably ignore awkward feeling your ear after you get sucked into game . unfortunately , me , this device not deliver what it promised : 1 . - when you connect device windows use it preferred sound device . so when if you trying play game you using other comm software chat your teammates , instead using your primary sound device game lifechat sound device voice , windows switch lifechat sound device all sounds , which , my view defeats purpose headset . you get around this selecting your primary sound driver windows settings menu , but this pain . 2 . - sound very low muffled . mike buzzing background noise , lot feedback echo . i problems trying understand what my team mates say they barely understand me . poor sound quality renders this device useless . i wished it different ... generally speaking , i like ms products , but this one really disappointed me , specially since i looking forward get it so long .	-1

i'm very satisfied this case . but first bad : 1 ) it scratches easily . i handle my incased ipod kid gloves it still shows minor scratches surface . but anybody who 5g ipods knows ipod itself , especially black one shows lot scratches compared prior ipods . i think most people would prefer scraches your $25 case vs your ipod so i can't complain too much . 2 ) belt clip bit difficult use . it comes off case very easily . but when you use it , it difficult remove it your belt . that not say it can't it not issue should keep you this fine product . it task probably require both hands though . 3 ) opening connection bottom ipod might too large some . those you who like most possible coverage your ipod might little disappointed case , but those who prefer bigger opening so you easily attach accessories , this plus . now good ( my mind , there lot more good vs . bad ): thing made me purchase this one looks . only other case i've used evo iskin , which rubbery type substance seems act magnet all sorts dirt . i prefer showcase b/c clear face allows you show off ipod itself . personally , i really don't like cases hide ipod under flaps leather or mounds rubber . ipod beautiful piece machinery should treated such . hard surface not dirt problem i rubbery case . there rubber goes around edge add protection drops , but rest it clear . this case allows complete ease removing ipod which you simply moving two switches side case . headphone jack accessible enough able fit l-shaped headphones . all all , this great case , esp money . if you one those who prefer absolute most protection you ipod , then there may other options better you . i think there probably more sturdier cases ones provide more complete coverage ipod . this case great if you like able access ipod easily , use accessories case , show off beauty ipod .	1

this s350dl everything i need portable radio . powered d-cells which seem last forever , fm audio fabulous $150 radio long distant night time am band reception simply great . just tune well lit lcd display frequency if there anything it worth listening it there . selectivity tremendous bandwidth set narrow . i live almost next door powerful station 820khz like listen weak one several hundred miles away 810khz , not problem . no interference strong station . my scant no doubt obsolete communications theory always held great radio reception , double or even triple conversion receivers norm . now i radio advertised highly sensitive selective latest state art single conversion analog tuner circuitry . what means , i haven't clue but i'm impressed . only negative thing i've found radio so far its fine tuning knob tendency jump past frequency you're trying tune up , then , when you tune back down it jumps past downside . i've heard this called backlash . eventually you get lock exact frequency but it minor annoyance . thing takes some getting used i'm so used push button scanning type receivers , rotating old fashioned tuning knob several turns get high end band low trys my patience . overall i'm happy camper find this radio good features far outweigh its bad .	1

i am using my second zune , awesome . first one got broken almost day after i received it . amazon good job replacing item quickly possible . zen media player great , especially user interface ... makes it so easy navigate .. radio feature also great .. i usually turn it go sleep ... i guess navigation better than ipod .. i am not big ipod fan myself but navigation zune far easier ... click wheel would make things more easier but i guess thats patented so microsoft cannot copy ipod ... screen large but they should higher resolution .. would great ... but even this resolution videos pictures good qualityabout zune software ... it drawbacks but synchronizing songs not difficult .. but not great either ... i rather buy cds than music online so i don't care whether they thousand songs or zillion songs .. i just want their online music catalog updated so i get my media library tuned zune .. i am not big fan managing music itunes or media player or zune , softwares like foobar or mediamonkey make life lot easier manage library .. esp . when you massive one like me ( 60gb ) ... constant updates zune software get betterabout wireless feature , i can't find soul around who zune .. so i don't really care ... i no comments thatzune equalizer five or six different settings , which plus factor .. it user friendly since it customizable some extent battery , i read many reviews it poor battery , well new version firewall this problem solvedearphones zune sucks ... they didn't even fit my ear .. i am using sony earphone bose headphones ... although zune earphones looks cool metal so you stick two earphones together .... i question if microsoft people aware electricity magnet produce electromagnetic field whose fore harmful body ... esp . sensative part like brain ... until unless i am not confirmed this doesn't effect brain .. i am not using themi my homework properly , my biggest competitive zen vision ( reviews this far better than zune even ipod , cnet even gave zen some title , product year or something ) but i took risk trusting microsoft ( which not good bet ) , so far it working up expectation .. sad part i around . 4 gb left cheer	1

i need this recorder i recently diagnosed w/ppm ( piss poor memory ) . seriously , this handy little gadget . it tiny size allows you carry it just anywhere yet buttons display big enough make it easy operate . i'm disabled writing very difficult so this recorder great classes instead taking notes . also , i often find myself forgetting some important bit information my doctor may mentioned so i now bring recorder every office visit . built microphone works very well i've it record voices over 15 ' away . variable control voice actuator record sounds reached certain volume then stop recording when volume drops . this means no more recording dead silence allows you use less memory . price low such great digital recorder i highly recommend it anyone looking buy digital recorder	1

i am not going write what this phone what it doesn't , you read it other reviews . i explain what problems i you might it . least it might help you troubleshoot similar issues . first , it easy setup phone , connect it router phone line , register your skype name make your first land line call . quality good . then i placed skype call friend .. first problem : no audio , nobody hears anything . i tried use skype account my computer make calls to/from sph200d .. no audio . i looked all settings device , support website found nothing . i tried connect admin webpage using provided cd documentation username password admin admin couldn't connect(second problem ) . well , i reset base unit still couldn't connect admin page . i searched online god bless internet found documentation cd old current username/password admin/password . what even better reseting base unit helped audio problems ! hooray ! now i make good quality skype calls without need go downstairs my computer . next biggest problem i've experienced no matter automatic sign option turned phone(and web page ) asking password every time you sign off/sign skype . turning phone off , reseting base/phone , using different skype id , etc not help . i called support , waited 15 minutes told i need register product online first . well it sense , i so called again . 10 minutes later customer representative deli ready provide me excellent service . first , he said yes automatic sign should work my phone not defective , asked me all steps i already , i.e. reseting , etc . no luck . then he left check this issue called me back state phone must ask password every time i sign security reason ! ( what remember username/password option there ? ) . nice lie customer make him believe problem solved . note : if you turn phone off - yes there option turn it off , please press hold red button - without signing off , then when you turn phone it wouldn't ask you password . right , but all this time phone off , friends see your status online/away may try call you . well , there solution i've found myself - never sign off , just change your status offline . i not decided yet whether return/replace unit or keep it . maybe when you learn tricks how use device it would serve you well . but current price/quality i would not recommend it , too bad there not many alternatives . good luck it	-1

battery grip k10d helpful some situations . it holds back-up battery actually functional camera without swapped out main battery , thus doubling your battery time . you remove it , however , change main camera battery . storage space inside grip also holds second sd card . i would given 5 star rating if this card also functional , however , it not merely serves storage card . wireless remote control also stores battery grip but don't expect find one box . you purchase remote separately ! i am not sure grip needs quite so large size makes camera diffficult tote smaller camera bags , makes it cumbersome hang around your neck . second shutter release control dials extremely handy ! overall i think this very good product only minor drawbacks ! i highly reccomend it anyone purchasing k10	-1

what it designed , speakers top notch . pros : pros fairly obvious : space saving , great look , no cumbersome wiring , surround effect clearly separated , it not dependent room configuration . additional pro sound quality : mid range wonderful , jazz vocal sounds fullness you'd expect polk audio . treble crisp without breaking . all-in-all , sound sufficiently top-notch even someone who appreciates good sound systems ( except some you serious audiophiles ) . pro speakers strong enough handle enough power sizable room , say 20x20 room . cons : cons pretty obvious too . it not real surround , so it not give 360-degree feel sound field , but rather gives 180-degree feel . note you need add your own subwoofer sufficient power your room size . bottom line , i am very happy this purchase .	1

i installed this machine home office network via ethernet . install took awhile , changed registry settings without asking . uninstall not restore system it original state ; only hours manual resetting . how many users restore registry ? further , software/drivers not like printer turned off or missing . if you install this road laptop , you expect program , hpzinw12 . exe , search missing printer every 100 seconds or so using all available cpu time . if you unlucky enough middle client presentation , chances good you just lost job . if you turn off printer office , your office systems also search printer display unclosable dialog asking you switch unknown program while using most their available cpu time .

long-time panasonic wet/dry shaver user , i've owned both high end low end shavers , including procurve , found closeness shave equal both . pricier razors need charging every week cheaper razors smaller , quieter lighter run several weeks charges . however , pricier razors also sealed against water intrusion much better last 5 or 6 years , less expensive ones start failing due leakage year or two . ( but price , who cares ? ) order get close shave these babies , secret shave shower when skin pores open . that why panasonic electric razors class themselves . when wet , they shave least close razor without risk cuts . ( when dry , their closeness no better than any other brand . ) money i didn't spend high priced model provided me good excuse also invest very nice nimh one hour battery charger enough high capacity nimh 2700 mah batteries ( thomas-distributing.com)to end my dependance disposable aa alkaline batteries forever . razor run tad slower 1.2 volt nimh batteries than 1.5 volt alkalines , but still works just fine . great little razor ridiculously low price . when other razor companies get message ?	1
i review this simply because it not great . noice cancelling its job , sound quality ok , but little bass side , but way headphones sat your head just uncomfortable . its plastic head thing folds nicely into pouch annoying because crack which you fold headphones sometimes gets your haird caught it pulls it out when taking them off . me glasses , i often readjust headsets often because they push sides my glasses my head too much , causing discomfort . so me readjust them , i often pull out hairs ! just plasticky hard feel them--it just not comfy . i'll admit i got quite bargain ten bucks this item , but i would never pay 40 bucks headphones like these , especially without cushioned headband others , cheaper prices , often offer .	-1

i read many customer reviews before buying this gps . now i see many things mentioned reviewers differ my personal experience . here what i noticed so far : 1 . maps : appear quite accurate . this writing , i not experience any problems maps . i doubt paper maps would more accurate , or updated more frequently . 2 . updates : i recently downloaded installed version 3.11 , no problems during or after installation . 3 . battery : not great , but quite reasonable . after all , it car gps , so most time it plugged anyway . if you need ac adapter , i suggest buying ac 12v converter instead . ( this what i ) . it more universal used power other units ( coolers , car phone chargers , etc . ) ac outlet . 4 . satellite reception tracking : no complains here . 5 . menus other ui : nothing horrible . when you get used it , it becomes comfortable . 6 . music player , photo viewer : imo absolutely useless . ( same bluetooth , which not build into this unit , some people complain ) . you really no better way playing your music or answering your phone calls ? then it pity . honestly , i am not sure why they even bother building all this functionality into car gps unit . still , it works , it not true you need proprietary software or specially formatted sd cards it . i used windows explorer standard sd card copy mp3 files my laptop play it my gps ( no magellan software ) . summary : good gps unit , especially price ( i got mine under $300 ) . if you need navigation computer , consider buying gps antenna your laptop , then carry it you all time :) . me , it enough not get lost unknown city , finally get where i wanted . plus , it quite cool know how far you destination , how long it take you get there , even if you know route heart	-1

this perfect width stand 46 " hdtv . it hangs it very secure would also good 52 " screens , although 52 " , set noticeably wider than stand . glass shelves themselves surprisingly strong tempered glass supposedly support up 50lbs , though you probably would not put large size amp/receiver it . however , it seems strong enough support my large 25 lb center speaker , which thanks adjustable shelves , i am able elevate it only half inch under my tv which ideal movie watching . i worried first center spkr might too heavy but it sitting pretty it 3 weeks now . i used wider sized glass top shelf accomdate my extra wide center spkr my dvd player glass shelf below it . my receiver sits base stand i always rest easy knowing receiver plenty ventaliation thanks open design adjustable height shelves . pole itself one solid piece extruded alumimum thick very well constructed . it probably strongest piece kit . base also reinforced metal framing underneath mdf wood base , so there no worries either base or pole failing . only thing not impressive black finish base which quite nice look shiny , but you tell layer lacquer used quite thin could wear out over time or chip easily if you're not careful . also , due finish glass shelves , there visible dust buildup after week or so . this project mostly 1 man project , but you probably need 2 people when it comes time mounting your bigscreen lcd or plasma stand anything 42 " or bigger . tools required phillips screwdriver wrench 6 large screws base where pole sits . rest screws all use allen wrenches which provided . also word advice glass shelves . try not put anything heavy made out metal or ceramic directly glass surface . while their structure quite strong , tempered glass easily shatter into thousands if pieces you knock it something made metal/cermamic . if you want put anything metal or ceramic it , then make sure it rubber feet or something	1

win me/98 it possible , file patch , use rudder pedals other games also change controller preference number ( 1 , 2 , 3 , etc . ) . win xp handles controllers differently doesn't allow this . when connecting rudder pedals usb saitek x52 joystick/throttle combo , pedals assume controller #1 , this cannot modified . pedals only work games support mulitple controllers . if game not , order use x52 , i unplug pedals so x52 assume #1 controller position . this really sucks makes one wish old winme/98 , however , they aren't stable xp nor some newer games backward compatible older os . so it bite-the-bullet live it . if your game supports multiple controllers your os winxp then these pedals outstanding , but frequently isn't case . don't play max payne or other games pedals plugged , they primary controller ... ugh	-1
using this more than fun ... it great . i records i not listened over 20 years getting them converted digital treat . using audacity not all easy work , but after 6 or 7 records it became easy . recording vinyl , through normailzation , removal clicks , adding titles lastly save it not difficult all . each record take 2 hours start my ipod , but results wonderful . great little feature audacity fade-in/fade-out feature . though my apologies some artists , it better fade song out than listen lot hiss some songs take 10-15 seconds end . my " thumbs up " this product . wish i bought turntable sooner	1

we bought everyone family one these christmas . wind it up power away . cell phone charger converters come it fit most cell phones family , but it not fit fire fly or newer nokia ( model fm radio capacity ) . but it fits other nokias sony ericson . we've lost power here st. louis twice 2006 days . we no radio , no tv , no bateries , nada . now , we prepared . it pick up tv somewhat , but this not what we got it . if there huge national crisis i doubt tv towers , stations , power outages support any tv or radio . but we light . flashlight not brightest , but it sufficient . when power goes out sund goes down , it dark . we feel better knowing we won't rely candles batteries . we bought orange white ones . they plasticy i wonder how long windy thing last , but careful use this radio certainly come handy until ameren ue tunes lights	1
i thought i monophonic purist until seeing consumer reports review rated sound quality kloss tivoli radio above even bose , boston acoustic , cambridge models providing it hooked up satellite speaker . so fifty bucks , why not ? speakers nightstands parallel my head , so sound hardly balanced . other hand , it kind cool hear trombone coming one side bed oboe other . so thumbs up extra speaker , though i'm not go crazy install kloss sub-woofer underneath bed . not only it over-priced but even without sub-woofer speakers , my ears , already bass-heavy . maybe i'll reconsider if my cat stops purring prospect vibrating mattress suddenly seems attractive .	-1

checking other reviews here amazon showed everyone either loved this western digital drive ( gave it 5 stars ) if it worked or else they blackballed it if it failed . prices these drives continue fall , since larger drives ( 500 gb well even 1000 gb ) now available , they really good buy excellent way externally store well transfer data . my experience this drive very easy install , reformat , use extra drive . no problems . only thing i really don't like fact it doesn't real on/off button . circle front turn off power , but whenever computer starts , this drive starts well . means unless drive manually turned off after computer starts , drive always when computer . i prefer drive only when i need it save it unnecessary wear tear . other external drives maxtor even other western digital drives real on/off switches . this drive make noticeable hum while running	-1

people saying years tapes would die , but fortunately , they never seem . i know number people who car stereo both cd cassette . matter , i am starting see cassette walkmans again . if you follow my reviews , you know because dangers cd rot , i prefer make tapes my cds use them when possible . those you who don't know cd rot , it capable wiping out whole collection cds . what happens heat moisture turn cd purple make it unreadable . ( extreme cases , holes cd prevalent . ) if your cds not so over top , they may actually transfer well onto normal bias cassettes such maxell ur or tdk . previous reviewer pointed out if you making tapes your cds use your car , lot times normal bias cassette suffice , since most car stereo speakers not designed high output . ( he called maxell ur perfect workhorse tape . ) but moving high quality tdk sa tape , these tapes superb capable holding material even high intense cds such " metallica " ' ride lightning , ' " megadeth " ' rust peace , ' or " exodus " ' tempo damned . ' i'll conclude saying tdk sa not only give you excellent travel friendly copies your cds , but using them when you travel keep your cds safe cd rot .	1

i picked these up compusa which closing many it stores . yes there fan noise but what you expect it raid . you writing reading data very fast rate would you rather fry drives ? drive not need sit right next you . set it farther back if it bothers you . if you want hear what real fan noise sit server room few hours configuring multiple drive raids few dozen servers around you . what i call fan noise . this thing nothing . it provides redundancy ( raid 1 ) very good cost point . personally i would only recommend raid 1 . if you run raid 0 loose one drive you loose all your data . this not raid 5 which allow you loose one drive keep going . so my advice if you need fast large amounts storage fail over ( raid 1 ) then this product you .	1
i would recomend these phones , especially anyone who invested $250+ mp3 player ( you may well listen well ! ) . they're collapsable , which makes traveling easy sound still great . much better alternative ear buds which more potential damage ear drums or cause other discomfort . they also come stereo head those us musically inclined who use amps . i wouldn't reccomend them use while running or other exercise beyond walking , but style , comfort , quality sound i give both thumbs up !	-1

i previous bad experience all-in-ones , but bought this i liked bw laser network feature ( got it during sale half price ) . i liked it so much i recommended it client , who replaced her aging fax machine . copy ability , sheet feeder , great , scanner works very well , even over network , everything seamlessly works macintosh windows computers ( i two macs windows box ) . scanning resolution good enough almost everything 600x600 . main downside , why it got 4 stars not 5 , reliability . my machine arrived malfunctioning copier . page would come out badly distorted . amazon sent new one , no hassles , i sent old one back . one i bought client staples , after she 6 weeks , it started problems . faxes wouldn't come out unless you turned it off again . no warning lights - just wouldn't work . when it came back , faxes saved memory last few days would spit out . frustratingly , when we called hp this , our warranty allowed us mail it them , wait 3 weeks , then they would send us same one back repaired . no thank you - i didn't buy machine without it 3 weeks . expedited option , which cost $50 , them send new one we would send old one back . they would ship new one next day air - after 2 week backlog . no thanks either ! so , buy machine it great machine , but keep your receipts , or consider otherwise evil extended warranty , there good chance this problems within few months	-1

i really liked idea this product , they some good templates , but after putting hours into designing book writing up captions , i printed it pictures looked horrible . software resizes images automatically fit layout , but some reason leaves pictures pixelated fuzzy . i took pictures 6mp camera , they look great when viewed computer or printed other software , but when this software resized them they came out terrible . there really no way around it , except try guess proper resolution each photo crop resize yourself before inserting photos , but would take several more hours . this product wasted hours my time left me very disappointed	-1
