using frozen fruit make up 4 smoothies every day , our family hard blenders . after more than year daily experience waring pro ( both mbb * pbb * models ) i cannot recommend them serious smoothing making . here why : both glass- stainless-jug models use same blade assembly . this blade assembly wears poorly when asked blend frozen fruit . it fails often , must rebuilt or replaced . parts easily purchased if you're handy correct tools . details : assembly screws together , threaded tighten under use rather than loosen fall apart . but this tightening action so great when blade contacts frozen fruit , it bends metal washer below blade . assembly eventually becomes so tight shaft cannot turn . waring pro all blender than many people need , but not sufficient daily maker multiple smoothies	-1

when i adopted cat couple weeks ago , two my good friends highly recommended fresh step premium clay cat litter . here why -- this fresh step premium clay cat litter excellent your favorite kitty litter box . company states it very good absorbing odors -- , golly , it true ! odors minimal very most it quite comfortable even my rather sensitive cat . moreover , i really like how litter capacity absorb prevent odor causing bacteria litter before my cat even uses his litter box . that plus any cat lover ! if you more than one cat manufacturer recommend , not surprisingly , you use more cat litter box . otherwise , if you just one cat , two or three inches worth this cat litter spread evenly throughout empty litter box fine . you should change entire litter box once week average . ( i change mine twice week just my cat comfort . ) it also good idea scoop out any " kitty remains " every other day or so . very certain not flush any " kitty presents " down toilet manufacturer warns against this . i suppose it could clog toilet pipes . moreover , you may suspect , any " kitty leftovers " could some nasty germs we don't want so wash your hands really carefully after you clean box or even after you just remove any " kitty presents " scooper . fact this clay litter helps because you use very inexpensive litter scooper remove any " kitty presents , " thus reducing number times you need change entire kitty litter box . nevertheless , i recommend changing entire litter box least once week . place contents used litter box into trash bag discard you would any other garbage . short , this great cat litter product great price . contents bag last long time , especially if , like me , you only one cat . manufacturer also offers customers ( us , not cats ) " awards " program points you accumulate your " account " company company internet website . nice plus ! ok , fresh step -- i thank you ; my father mother thank you ; , most importantly , my cat says thank you !!! smiles	1

this extra chime you purchase if you already receiver . i am purchasing one because it working so well . i am professional dog trainer , all i say product great , but owners who not know how teach something their dogs probably should call dog trainer help this if you unsure how proceed . professional dog trainer , i still live my family members who decidedly not dog trainers . our toy poodle essentially house-trained when i home , but because my teenagers husband oblivious her subtle signals she needed go out , she ended up peeing front door , because nobody letting her out . so , i got lentek door chime , taught my dog use it , now no more accidents because she signaling way everybody hear . we also put pad outside so she signal come back . everybody happy . now i'm getting pad upstairs , because we still oblivious teens hubby .... so , great product , but sure you * both * parts product , give good trainer call help you get started .	1

this my first time use electric krumkake baker i previously old type you use over stove . i feel baker doesn't bake evenly both sides ........ top krumkake cookie nice but bottom remains soggy side which leads me believe heat uneven . also there no indicator light let you know when cookie . therefore you really pay attention your time . usually it took only 55 seconds minute . also hard get two cookies commpletely round ..... batter ran into each other . perhaps my batter too runny but used this recipe before old iron without trouble . i'm point perhaps single baker would better than double . hope find person could demonstrate two cookie krumkake maker ...... perhaps would help . trying open-minded !	-1

we actually purchased 4 piece set ( unfortunately leaving review not option there . ) it indeed hardwood frame , beautiful suede-like microfiber cusions zip-off covers . color definitely more lines hot chocolate color rather than creamy chai color screen- but still blends beautifully into neutral palette . #60 ; br / #62 ; #60 ; br / #62 ; assembly bit challenging- you may need third or fourth hand . instructions certainly aren't complete enough- they more like general pictures , so there bit guesswork involved . upholstered side panels take bit quot ; elbow greasequot ; fit into frame properly . took us hour put together few o-o ver adjustments precision . #60 ; br / #62 ; #60 ; br / #62 ; i love back cushions velcro hold them place . cushions also surprizingly firm , but because seat longer than average legs , you tendancy lounge . i'm not sure what weight restrictions , but we 700 lbs couch it remained one piece ( can't say all couches we've ! ) overall very impressive package price ! we received free shipping used 10% off online coupon code so it great deal . i also highly suggest matching table set	1

i don't this brand . i gifted brand starts " " . it looks same , but costs little more . i enjoy using it since i usually bottle night . it keeps temp right where you set it . it take while i would suggest your wine chilled already or willing wait 2 hours it come down temp . though , once i open bottle it keeps it perfect temp next few hours i might enjoy drinking it . one complaint i it large cham-pain bottles don't fit narrow hole . though i not found wine bottle not fit . if you don't want mess ice water , i would suggest this unit . if you looking rapid cooler 20 minutes freezer would work better . ultimatly , if this break , i would buy one . cheers ,	1

i using honing stone i am also proud able sharpen all my knives stone ( except serrated ones ) . then i gave this thing try wow ! it works , consistently ease . when using honing stone , it hard maintain correct edge angle , this device takes guess work out . friend mine thinks his buck knife sharp until he reset edge wustof stage 1 carbide edger then hone it stage 2 ceramic sharpener . then he surprised how his " new " knife shred paper like razor . then we tried scissors learned specially shaped slot should prevent one inserting scissors wrong way ( right handed vs . left handed scissors ) . quality great . comes non-slip padding grip well several other sides so you grip it hold down counter top several positions/ways steadily . downside it bit pricey . there cheaper ones out there which i believe would work similarly but would probably lack little quality touches here there .	1

filter made paper you change often , otherwise it melts down . it $6.99 each . even if you buy cheap machine , it would turn into expensive machine . if you don't change filter , this machine mists stinky water . i use filtered water however , i smell it . also , i noticed ... when there no water , it doesn't stop automatically . it work forever when you don't stop . example , fan inside rotated more than 24 hours without water . i didn't know . after , i often check if there water inside or not . i still 3 more filters . after i use them , i trash it . i not buy it again	-1

these sheets indeed much more wrinkle resistant than my old 100% cotton 400-thread count ( very expensive ) sheets , but much thinner , surprisingly , suggesting more delicate threads . this fact borne out when less than month after starting use them , one my cats " kneaded " bed his claws , sheet irreparably shredded . this never happened before any sheets i owned 40 years multiple cat owning . sure , i've gotten thread pulls tiny little holes other sheets , but not knife-like cuts appeared these sheets , after just one kneading session . it really looked like someone taken pair scissors stabbed sheet repeatedly . despite high thread count , this cotton thin delicate . so beware if you pet-owner . you get what you pay these inexpensive sheets	-1

i used sell dishwashers sears . i've owned several built full sized dishwashers , even stainless steel bosch . this first one i am ' giddy ' over . i recently downsized move manhattan , which meant getting small kitchen no dishwasher . after months sink washing , i broke down bought this ( actually , house guest felt sorry me , got it me after i mentioned i buy it ) . but not without reading all specs reviews . i bought it etronics ( i've bought them before ) pleased customer service ( so far ) . they best price ( no delivery charge , they local store too ) . after unpacking inspection , i concluded it built same specs top line kenmore ( which i used sell ) . it form fitting stainless steel interior , mechanical controls ( which , imo , better than electronic machine gets wet alot ) , well fitting seals , stable casters . interior full size depth height , just 6 inches narrower width ( brand , which i viewed spot , not nearly deep , rickety trays ) . upper tray two height settings , but i found lower setting not suitable standard size dishes fit below . trays fit well , perhaps bit too snug , but we'll see if they loosen up use . tines spaced bit close together my taste , but after washing , it appears 1805 handle dishes so close together . there lower spray arm , middle spray arm top sprayer ( non-spinning ) . food filters heating element base sturdy well made . complaint : hose hook-up 6 feet long ( apparently measured inside back where they connect machine , they seemed too short 1805 must right up against sink counter hook-up . i've never portable before , ( exception my dear grandmother ) always looked down them . this one looks solid clean lines any kitchen . rear panel , however , you see few ( covered ) rivets seams , black-plastic lined hose receptable , serial tags . unless you store it against wall , you see these protrusions . it should fit all your other appliances without standing ou t.t he standard load time took 45 minutes run . machine attaches easily your faucet , though you replace your areator adapter produces narrower stream water faucet when dw not use . i've only used " economy " cycle , which worked great , but there also pots pans , delicate , rinse only cycles . additionally , delicate cycle no heat option , pots pans extra boost option . it heats water steaming hot . very quiet . though not quiet bosch i owned ( which i think quieter than meile ) , it quiet my kitchen aid . it definitely quieter than all plastic tub models out there . though hardly used , i experienced no leaks . this even operated non-level floor . my building 110 years old floors very slanted swelled . this my biggest concern . after each cycle , i took my flashlight looked underneath any signs water .... none . ( my neighbors below would not appreciate un-requested shower ) . i am penny-pincher , stressed over purchase . not because price , but because value price . i couldn't believe such inexpensive dishwasher could deliver like this one . i seriously say this dishwasher outperforms dishwashers twice its price . it carries in-home 1 year warranty , but i always like stores like sears where if you complain enough they take it back without any questions . so this bit leap , danby relies authorized service centers ( which i hope i never use )	1

i purchased both hencle pro sabatier grand chefs amazon . after two weeks using testing both sets knives , i decided return sabatiers keep pro . both sets good quality , even thought i notice scratches handles both sets . but i purchase knives use abuse , rather than hanging them decorations so minor scratches don't bother me too much . what matter me performance more importantly feel . i gotta say henckels just felt more solid me seemed sharper , cutting thru pretty much anything like butter . sabatiers other hand seemed little dull straight out box . factor i considered accessibility far warranties servicing concerned . i yet see any stores my area carry sabatiers lifetime warranty henckel i pretty much go my local retailer swap out any individual knives if needed . basically , i think it just comes down individual preference , mine happens henckle pro !!	1

i dont lot extra money so i couldnt justify buying this while i handmixer worked . needless say , last saturday , my hand mixer finally beat dust ... meanwhile i little happy dance ...... bought this . i lot cookies . that my specialty . only gripe i maybe bowl could bigger so i could my triple batches , but whatever . i cant afford more expensive one just so it would bigger bowl . i got use it first time tonight my oatmeal raisin . yeah little noise , but not unexpected or scary . there little movement too , but again not unexpected considering how thick mixture . i lift it every once awhile make sure all mixture getting beat but didnt really need to- everything got mixed very thoroughly ; much easier than stand there hand mixer fight it . i havent messed dough hook simply because i use breadmaker , i havent used whip because i really never needed either . i am looking forward getting some attachments , especially ice cream one meat grinder . we try eat " natural " possible , i am looking forward doing ground chicken other things . i know its not investment enter into lightly , but its well worth money because i know this last me into my middle age . i love heft this machine also . i am one buys most durable things i ; i sewing machine made switzerland , i tell this same type construction- all metal .	1

this little toaster oven gets job me . i think quality little bit better , it little deeper making it little bigger tempeture more consistant than other units it price range . i am still looking right setting tempeture once i find it i most likely leave it there . i think it end up somewhere 350 400 . below takes long above setting food tends get little over cooked outside . one thing concerned me safety instructions , which i always read . they not want you use aluminum foil or any non proctor silex cooking trays this unit . i always use aluminum foil it not seem cause any problem . perhaps they just covering themselves case something goes wrong because you never know what sort crazy stuff people going put into their ovens . this only thing concerns me . otherwise little oven working out real good . i think it last us quite while . usually we get rid them because they get dirty or get little old looking more then it problem they wear out or break . last one cost us $10 lasted almost year . this one cost little more but i am sure it last longer . we expensive confection ovens cost well over $100 but i decided save my money because this one gets job what we need it . esp extra 2 inches depth this nice sized little unit .	1

this pretty much same review i wrote 8 " chef . i liked knife well enough i'm considering buying block set , though i don't know if handle design work well smaller knives . i'd give set five stars because it includes no knives too stupid or too specialized ( like boning knives bread knives slicers ) basic knife kit ( especially home cooks ) but inclusion laughably dubious kitchen scissors drags it down bit . 6 " chef probably marginally more useful than 6 " utility , but it nice least one knife you're willing hand your less skilled friends . set also includess diamond hone , which actually sharpen knives , not just align their edges ( though i use dmt diamond hone sharpening . ) here body other review . since i planning spend few days commercial kitchen , my 6 " henckels knives both embarrassingly small serious work embarrassingly dull because i'm too lame sharpen them , i decided grab 8 " chef knife ( bed , bath beyond , 20% off coupon . ) it worked extremely well all tasks i set it today , including mincing parsley chiffonading mint well usual cutting tasks . despite its shallow curve ( i strongly prefer knives whose edges mostly straight , rather than curved french style ) blade rocked very well mincing , flat enough cut completely through rolled mint leaves one short stroke . furthermore , sharpness impressed other people who used it , though we shall see if it resharpened same degree . handle design clearly not everyone , but i found it very comfortable when i held knife many cooks , back end blade pinched thumb forefinger(s ) . particular , most knife handles/bolsters seem designed people who grip knives solely their handles but integrated bolster made it feel * right * grip knife blade . handle * seems * just right weight balance blade , but i'll reserve judgment whether it actually well-balanced until i've spent more than few hours using it . i no idea if i'll continue like this knife it enters daily use . i hope amazon let me revise my rating later if it turns out overly optimistic , but based this one afternoon use ( since they force me rate it ) i gave 8 " chef five stars	1
simply put , awesome churn home-made ice cream . i old hand-crank i always used make best ice cream , but it lot work - churning fast beginning then slowing down cream transformed . this churn , motor variable its speed churns excellent fast speed begin ; then , cream solidifies freezes , motor changes pitch slows down give you wonderfully whipped smooth cream . i even made ice cream using just whole milk peppermint sticks it still turned out great . highly recommended much better than any other electric churn you buy . i've two other electric churns - neither them could hold candle white mountain	1

idea great , when this attractive mister worked , it excellent . however , it frequently emitted olive oil ( we never used it anything else ) thin stream instead mist . when happened , i tried clean spray valve no avail , then suddently it would mist again . pump mechanism ( manual ) somewhat difficult create adequate pressure , we suspect persons arthritic hands would not able use it . after somewhat satisfactory use five years , it failed completely . so maybe we get our money worth all things considered . am now looking better model replacement	-1

although it effective any similar heater , it some annoying design features . display only stays few seconds after changing setting . i don't know why it can't stay all time . like it isn't running batteries after all . its bright red pilot light stays long it plugged but there no indicators tell you if it , off , or thermostat . you would walk over it , bend down , attempt read dark display figure out ( you might need flashlight ) . they foolishly use same button start oscillation turn it off . turn it off you hold button down several seconds ( short tap starts it oscillating ) . fortunately i found quicker way turn it off . i just tip it enough engage tip-over safety switch it goes right off . much quicker than holding down stupid button . if you're not easily annoyed , you might like this heater	-1

ok - negative reviews this pretty out there ; they either complaining non-existant issues ( um , 1 star someone who didn't even buy it ? becuase it supposedly doesn't come 110 ? that wacky ) , or wrong expectations what this machine . bottom line this espresso maker it guts their more expensive models ( minus 3 way solenoid , which no effect how espresso made ) if you know what you doing make espresso well pretty much any model out there . over-simplify , espresso makers come one 2 basic types portafilter ( that thing handle you put espresso grounds ) . pressurized or non-pressurized . former basically pulls same shots no matter what you , long your beans fresh your grinder good . latter requires bit more art science . tamp ( compacting grinds into portafilter ) critical , you vary way shot pulled different grind size , tamp preassure tamper type . this , while harder consistently , only way properly hunt elusive " god shot " . so - onto this machine : using " perfect crema " disc just silly , frankly . fact , i don't even think there one my box . i know what it , which basically convert traditional espresso maker into pressurized one . but hey , if that what you want then buy pressurized one one myriad manufacturers out there . however , if you want model let you explore your inner barista , you need buy non-pressurized portafilter unit . money , there no way you going get better deal than gaggia . fact , there number different models gaggia line , all which basically same until you get $500 one , which comes aforementioned 3 way solenoid . sure , there different designs , some changes type frother ( don't bother auto-frothers ) but guts same , right down brass portafilter . i chose this particular one because its water capacity size drip tray , which beleive it or not pretty big deal when you pull lot shots day , i . fact , this machine beauty . get good it you'll pull shots good any machine out there , if you total tweek-head , you even pid this bad boy ( look it up ... ) . but you want more ? go check out coffeegeeek dot com read read read . synopsis : want machine keep up your growing barista skills ? buy this now . don't care art , just want quick fast espresso ? go elsewhere pick pressurized portafilter unit . oh , either way you go , you need good grinder ( gaggia mdf rocks reasonably priced $200 ) , you want fresh beans - order online one many fresh roasters out there ; it makes incredible difference	1

i given this dish ( request ) my birthday it barely gotten rest since ! it works wonderfully pies tarts , but even better baked appetizer dishes or nachos . dish washes well dishwasher stacks nicely cabinets . i wish it little handles edges better gripping when it comes out oven ( it rim good hold onto , but clumsy chefs , something more might better ) . other than , i love this dish keep finding more more uses it	1
price , it amazing this steamer anything , which accounts all rave reviews . this little number not real powerful , so you don't get effortless , quick steamer results most us seek . steam output low , so you go over over garment , little improvement . forget using it linen . even thin cotton , it creates tiny spider wrinkles . you hold hose vertically prevent water spurting , which awkward dangerous , hose gets hot . you door near electrical outlet . then hook doesn't fit over thickness door , nor hose reach item hanging it . it much work ironing , but ironing , you eventually achieve desired result . steamer compact , heats quickly doesn't take up much room . i returned mine , but there may few people who like this steamer	-1

global 10quot ; great knife comes very sharp edge . it rather light ( least 10quot ; knife ) well balanced . it well situated both slicing meats cutting dicing vegetables , it easy hold knife forward towards its blade quick balanced wrist action . only reason i gave this knife 4 stars not five due handle . while it dimpled it still get slippery when cutting fatty meat . i would prefer synthetic handle covering , but otherwise this well designed tool -- perhaps best chef knife available now	1

i got this out frustration trying find places charge all our gadgets . we cords gadgets everywhere ! ( two pdas , two cell phones , ipod , bluetooth earpiece . ) this item helped us get organized tremedously . pros : nice sturdy wood velvet trim . door back holes each end you choose which side you want power strip cord come out . two extra slots door allow cords come through well . also comes two plug extenders allow you plug those chunky transformer-type chargers . cons : almost all my chargers those chunky transformer-type chargers , so i plug one charger into regular outlet run cord through slots . i could used probably 3 more those plug extenders b/c transformers cover up plugs power strip . maybe you find some electronic store solve this problem . it also little cumbersome set up , but long run it pays off everything hidden organized . i would highly recommend this product	1

i've mine years it outshines every other decanter i've ever owned or used - performance well beauty table . most decanters fairly easy fill but very hard pour . guests often reluctant tip traditional , bell-bottomed decanter far enough pour it . before first trickle wine comes out , it feels like they're holding it upside down dump it all over table . traditional decanters also require some strength lift high enough twist far enough begin pouring , especially when reaching across table . i've often seen people start , put down decanter stand up get safer grip . this awkward say leas t.t he " duck " much better every count . long handle balances perfectly hand ; pouring minimum effort still stable enough pass down dining table confidence . low , elongated body decanter doesn't picked up nearly far off table or tipped nearly so dramatically fill glass . size handle makes reaching , pouring passing simple matter . notes wine purists : unlike traditional shape , you'll never need funnel fill " duck " without splashing . surface area wine duck easily comparable best traditional decanters , giving big young wines enough oxygen soften nicely table . long neck just enough " edge " bottom trap sediments . long spout allows you spot any trace sediment well before it reaches glass , gentle slope lets you pull back softly without inducing turbulence stirs sediment back into remaining wine - helping salvage final half-glass . pour control simply unmatched . crystal hand-blown sparkles like fine stemware , shape looks much more elegant table than photo any web page possibly convey . spend money . it worth every cent	1

this cheap toaster oven makes toast grilled cheese sandwiches heats up pizza . if you handle it gently don't put anything top it shouldn't there , it peform such tasks well , fact it " gets hot " won't problem . we've purchased one my office , despite initial concerns our office manager who , after reading some reviews below , feared it might blow up or catch fire . several us , however , previous experience black decker products knew they reliable . therefore , we bought toaster oven using it prepare breakfast , lunch snacks . moral : you get what you pay . this product inexpensive . it isn't going roast your thanksgiving turkey , it won't last forever , but it works .	1

pros : professional smoothies ( exactly like jamba juice)very easy cleanpolycarbonate carafequick ( its business very quickly)cons : expensive ( not everyone spends $400 blender)loud ( not appropriate apartment living)bulky ( its significantly larger than normal blender)when i unpacked this blender i knew right away it very serious machine . base very large heavy duty two large switches . one pulse other high low speeds . engine rated 3 horsepower power cord very think similar cord used high power drill or garage tool . unit itself geared metal socket matches toothed metal gear built into carafe . no plastic clutch break . lightweight polycarbonate carafe sits four posts , but need you hold it down your hand top it work correctly . blade four prong item splayed out broad flat blade each tooth . idea here super sharp blade isint necessary this thing spins very very fast . i quite startled when i hit pulse . this thing spins up instantly very loud . i would almost say twice loud conventional blender . said it also very high speed pulverizes frozen items impunity . i put frozen strawberries this pulverized them so well seeds not evident . ice doesn't stand chance all . this device appears more powerful than pro blenders used local smoothie place or gym . it every bit professional i would challenge anyone break this ice or other items short metal carafe . cleanup snap everything plastic or rubber . gunk under blades also not issue you just fill carafe some water quick half second pulse cleans everything base . i would caution people while this may last blender you ever buy , it not really consumer appliance . this machine much common standard blender chainsaw hair clipper . i really like it but my neighbors hate it . five stars because it lamborghini blenders smoothies amazing . but like exotic car , it not everyone .	1

i just got mine mail other day . little research word-of-mouth told me it made great coffee , guess what ? it ! first pot we brewed ( after running some plain water through it once ) best pot drip coffee i've ever made home . we took pot out soon it stopped brewing suggested other reviwes . coffee just little too hot drink black immediately stayed warm fresh 3 or 4 hours . we also able pour full caraf without spilling anything . we tried automatic timer , it worked flawlessly . smell coffee woke me up before alarm . one important note : if you concerned some reviews where people said caraf broke , don't worry . if you get " stainless " version ( select " stainless " color ) it comes all-stainless-unbreakable caraf no glass liner . it few dollars more , but it very nice unit . we ordered it amazon thru " finejewelry_4u " they included free gold filter helped offset extra cost . couple minor notes : threaded cap caraf takes bit getting used if you unsteady hands . unit also taller than your average coffee pot ( or least our previous pot ) , so we pull it out under our cabinet pour water . otherwise , no complaints here , thus far .	1

we using this mill 4 months , it looks great table , but that it . it grind pepper , but adjusting it very hit-and-miss ( mostly miss ) , it won't hold adjustment very well . fine setting , it works ok , but it nearly impossible get coarse grind out it - it seems go fine medium , then too open grind all . we got better results out 20-year old no-name pepper mill . i would not buy this mill again	-1

i've using tefal ' maxifry ' dry fryer some time but it two ' problems ' prompted me look alternative : it difficult clean lowest temperature setting 302�f . i like blanch potato fries low temperature before i crisp them up high temperature - purely matter personal taste . this not possible tefal it could not set lower temperatures . after reading various product descriptions reviews it quickly became apparent waring apparently best products - albeit cost . i looked df200 df250 but nowhere could i find explanation differences them so i opted df250 it only one mentioned waring website so i assumed it would later model . price i paid ( 6 times what i paid tefal ) my expectations high - it seemed what i looking : easy clean dishwasher operation down 175�f . unfortunately i disappointed this product following reasons : 1 . amazon clearly states their website df 250 food capacity 3.75 pounds ( it even says this image below box i'm typing ) but waring packing manual lists this only 2.2 pounds - significantly less than advertised . 2 . i sold idea immersion heater heat oil i thought this would more efficient than external heater . unfortunately because this heater occupies so much space inside oil vat , twice much oil required , thus this potential benefit immersion heater lost . it also means cost replacing oil effectively doubled . 3 . temperature control awful seems swing over 50�f range - one moment food cooking too fast next it seems cold . i've seen it turn off 45 minutes once it reached temperature ! i don't know if it really designed this way or there fault thermostat this unit . effect , i'm back manual control ( flicking switch off ) i use tefal maintain temperature 260�f . 4 . basket handle sticks out unit ( out counter top ) so it would very easy catch this someone walked . i would very concerned young children around this unit when oil 375�f . ihe tefal nice safe fold-away handle . 5 . next issue may seem bit trivial but it annoyed me . large lid df250 removable . fact it needs removed order practice safe cooking techniques ( like slowly immersing fries into hot oil ) . so where should very hot big lid safely put down ? you need some extra space around this unit operate it something put lid not damaged hot metal . tefal , lid hinged up . stated above , unit cook food nicely - it shame i stand guard over it continually adjust it while use . this price i expected better . my old tefal looks good comparison .	-1

professional like sharpening home good price . i love this sharpener trust it performance good knives . magnetic guides make sure you sharpen knife correctly so go ahead , run your expensive knives through it ; it great job	1
i thrilled when i first began use this project - it very sharp very strong , crunching through small bones ease . however , safety lock bad place - it small easily engaged , quite few occasions now , mere action cutting - when lock gets sideswiped chicken itself - engage lock , then i manually open it up again . it extremely irritating - i would call it major design flaw . if it weren't lock , i'd reccomend these shears anyone - but i'd hesitate recommend them now . i deal them , i'm sure there way learn live them well ( after all , they cut beautifully , so long you avoid activating lock ) - but i don't feel there should need " break-in " period new pair poultry shears	-1

i purchased this set my mother who falls drops things regularly due disability . i wanted dish set her would difficult break . so far , these held up well . fact , they're deceptively durable , they look nice . however , complain ( i like complain ) , i would say this dishware too costly . i've recently seen ads similar dishware more reasonably priced . these also too light my mother taste . they slide around her table very easily ( though it nothing place-mat can't fix ) . oh yeah , they took long time delivered	1
i bought this because it looked great , but it turns out it very functional also . it looks great counter since it stainless steel , it quite heavy there no danger tipping . i worried lids weren't tight enough because they just pop , but i cereal it over month still fresh . bigger cereals come out little more difficulty then smaller cereals , but they don't come out crushed . bins big enough so entire box cereal fits it once . mine didn't smell bad like some reviewers said after putting couple pieces together it ready go	1
i , like few others , am shocked good reviews some folks given this machine - if they pets , they obviously light carpet can't see pet hair this machine doesn't pick up . i two large dogs ( german shepherd shepherd mix ) house . we dark green carpet throughout our living room , dining room , stairs , light carpet other areas our home . we previously bought inexpensive eureka boss machines worked great year , but because we vacuum least hour day , we replacing vacuums every 1-2 years . i bought this machine few months ago extremely unhappy it ( threw box away could not return it store or it would gone ! ) . i spend least 2-3 times longer vacuuming , trying get hair out our dark green carpet . you can't really see it light carpet their always lot hair dirt canister , so it seems work just fine . attachments real pain use , so much so i don't even bother any more . i only wish i gone consumer reports first , they also not rate this machine very well , especially picking up pet hair . buyer beware !! ( ... or least keep box try it out first , so you return it !! )	-1
i received this machine christmas because my wife knows i usually get one cup coffee middle day work . this machine easy use works great . it works using home cafe pods well , but i tried melitta java pods , i got brown water . melitta pods state they designed exclusively use " one : one coffee maker " you get most coffee flavors using home cafe pods though . pods may not most cost effective way make coffee , but it sure easy	1

i owned overgrown set these knives 4 years now waited until i significant use comparison write this review . i also own similar knives wusthof classic compare directly . this review copied other henckels international classic reviews i wrote modified slightly particular item reviewed although i left comments other knives . disclaimer : i enjoy sharpening knives so edge retention rarely issue me i probably sharpen even my best knives too much . besides stone sharpening every 6 months or so , i also steel my knives just every time i use them . bottome line : i really love this set knives ( although i got one dud bunch ; only reason i am not giving this line 5 rating ) . edges almost if not just good more expensive knives but finish lacking ( although only somewhat ) . relatively great value . i not feel like these knives very sharp out box but they take scary edge quite easily keep it long time ( many , many months regular steeling home use ) . 8 inch chef : this very nice knife if you get over fact finish not nice higher end stuff . this i mean edges handle bolster sharper than they my wusthof classic . it takes holds edge well . i also own wusthof 8 inch chefs knife feel like this one takes just sharp edge . i yet determine difference edge retention two lines , so means they least comparible . much i thought i would enamored wusthof , i really don't believe additional cost worth small amount performance gain you might get buying wusthof . truth , i still enjoy using henckels international chef knife just much wusthof . heft wonderful curvature blade ideal chopping . i really like how point taperd very thin blade . finish aside , this right up there best them allows user slice point quite effectively . 6 inch chef : my wife swears this knife it consistantly one sharpest we own . some reason ( perhaps thinner blade ) , it holds its edge like sharp little devil it . this knife true pleasure own use . it very effective feels wonderful my hand . i may becoming knife snob , but i see no reason buy any other 6 inch chef knife , all you would getting fancier name smoother edges handle bolster . we reach this one multiple times each day it retains its edge far better than expected price . 4 inch parer : i don't like this one much my wusthof parers but my wife likes it much better . it always one she reaches ( many times per day ) . i personaly prefer thinness flexibility wusthof parer blades . this one quite rigid although it very sharp , it not seem sharp thinner wusthof parers , nor it hold its edge long . other hand , its size perfect parer , coming sweet spot 3.5 inch wusthof 4.5 inch wusthof parers i compare it . i would love own 4 inch wusthof parer . aditionally , diminished depth blade probably preferable deeper wusthof parer blades tasks such peeling toward you . i bought one these my mother it good test edge retention she rarely sharpens never steels . [ ... ] . 6 inch utility : i not use this knife much . it seems quite redundant my 4.5 inch wusthof parer ( which also not see much use ) or my favorite boning knife ( beat up resurected chicago cutlery 5 inch utility scary sharp joy use ) . truth , almost every task my kitchen quite well either parer or chef knife . i really don't see much use 6 inch utility . said , this knife sharp pleasureable use . still , this one , i would prefer thinner perhaps more flexible blade . it quite rigid makes me not want use it much . sandwiches , cheese , tomatoes , etc . it quite appropriate , but i would still probably prefer my 6 inch or even 8 inch chefs knives such tasks they thinner edge therefore seem much sharper . bread knife : aside fact this would benefit longer blade , this effective any other we tried . you don't bread knife this nice , but this one certainly job well . boning knife : i honestly never used this knife more than trial basis . it just not stack up my older chicago cutlery boning/utility knife . you can't really compare two , however , since one very flexible thin(cc ) other very rigid thick(hic ) . i strongly prefer thin , flexible boning knife . finish this knife horrible my particular set . it rounded ( not supposed ) end blade not sharpened point , leaving rounded blunt tip ( exactly opposite what you want good boning knife ) . i never able get point where i want it . i am certain i just lemon try return it if possible . so overall , i love these knives . myself my wife , they get just much use my wusthof classics . unless finish critical you or you like other people know you spent lot money , your pocketbook favor . i think these knives just good much less money	1
i bought set these glasses . i happy thick bottoms thought they would good sturdy glasses . they not last year . bottoms never broke , but they all cracked top . i would not recommend these if you children or teens aren't careful placing glasses sink or dishwasher .	-1
best part this fryer it ease cleanup oil easilly drained , pan holds oil comes out . also element disconnects so you really clean this thing . unit not turn if heating element isn't attached properly which nice safety feature . outside doesn't get hot i thought it would though i'm sure you could still burn yourself if you touched it any long period time .	1

if you like product light weight , sturdy aesthetically pleasing , then this measuring cup you . difference use this item normal pyrex quite pronounced ; it pours better , handles better because it so lightweight . you also won't spill things readily , because there enough'slosh'room allowed after you fill it top , 1/4 cup . just don't bang it around , it won't take much abuse pyrex , but small price pay	1
i feed my cat small amount dry food twice day . this only automatic feeder allows you control portion ( least small amounts ) reasonable capacity ( 6 holes ) . this second one these i've purchased ( amazon price ($40-50 or so ) significantly less than first one i bought ($60-70 ) , i got first one cheapest price available -- time it wasn't offered amazon ) . anyway , i bought second one so we could leave cat home alone longer 3 max days time . second feeder allows us go out town few days longer peace mind he'll continue fed properly time.it easy use , easy clean , relatively solid construction . my cat tried figure out ways trick it open , so far it hasn't happened ( unless it low batteries -- see below ) . although this best auto feeder market moment , there some things would improve it greatly . we've using original feeder couple years now , but motor/middle section doesn't seem reliable mechanism i wouldn't surprised if it up died one day . same time , it going almost every day past 2 years pretty reliable . we remove button advancing feeder couple months , since it got stuck top turning continuously . now we just use pen or stick finger into hole press button . not big deal , but little ghetto.it drains batteries little quicker than i'd prefer , but it not terrible . when battery running low , it malfunctions different ways . sometimes it'll only turn halfway . other times it'll turn partially then reverse itself -- these instances my poor cat couldn't access his meal . other times , it'll turn when it not supposed -- these instances my cat got more food than he supposed quite happy . also , clear plastic flap covering middle controls broken off -- part my cat attempts trick system . again , just superficial thing since it hasn't affected functioning so far . digital control more options low-battery indicator would improve this feeder greatly . ultimate feeder would like petmate le bistro feeder but could dispense small amounts not allow pets figure out how pull out food themselves . my cat would figure one out so quick probably get so fat . so this feeder still much better than anything out there moment . i would still recommend it	1
it soft medium-sized . didn't pay too much them so didn't feel too bad when friends would come over ask if they could take one . now i don't any left , but they're interseting little soft " stuffed animal " kind thing . no real practical purpose probably - i heard it horror if it ever opens/spills its contents . it kind funny - thing itself soft - but it comes huge box tons air pillows ( when you order it amazon least ) . so if you're moving need packing material , then here 2-for-1 special .	1
this set wonderful it includes everything you really need cutlery set . most commercial stamped sets include upwards twenty knives , but you'll end up using five or six regular basis . quality these forged blades stunning edges razor sharp . proper honing , using steel included set , these blades keep their edge over year daily use . i would recommend finding local bladesmith edge sharpened professionally . it isn't expensive maximize performance . handle itself comfortable balance feels natural . although manufacturer says these dishwasher safe , i would suggest immediate hand washing after use complete drying before returning it block .	1
i bought one these towels quest satisfy my sweetie desire thick , soft , huge bath sheet gets softer use but stays thick . nine months down road , i'm happy report this towel all those things , no loose threads or snags . i can't say one way or other whether anti-microbial feature makes any difference -- but towel never stinks , which good sign . amazon price good investment towel around many years	1

" bristles " this brush pretty odd ; they're wide flat made silicone . they really don't look very effective , yet they're surprisingly useful . they trap liquids them quite well . this means more what you're brushing onto your food goes onto your food instead dripping all over place . better than , you won't any more bristles getting shed into your food . i'd almost given up traditional pastry brushes because phenomenon . you also fit this brush into your dishwasher , which means--gasp!--it'll come clean ! normal pastry brushes such total pain clean this alone makes this brush worth i t.t he handle -- which screws apart head -- ergonomically shaped pliable , making it easy hands . it also hollow , allowing you fill it basting liquid ( or other liquid you want brush onto something , such melted butter pastry ) , dripless valve head helps keep basting liquid coming out when you don't want it . since brush handle translucent you even see how much basting liquid you lef t.t hen there brush stand . normally when using pastry brush i lie it flat paper towel or plate or prop it awkwardly against something . cuisipro brush you just tuck it vertically into its stand . it nice , flat base keep it upright , it contains any mess , leaving you only stand wash -- which just go into dishwasher rest brush parts . brush separates into three parts -- handle , head stand -- washing . it would pretty tough wash thoroughly hand , so it really helps able put it through dishwasher . you should tuck it into utensil cage or something similar , however , because head small potentially easy lose . all all , i no reservations recommending this pastry brush , expect get much use out mine	1
if you're looking inexpesive racking large capacity cellar you're creating , this it . if you're looking decorative rack your dining room , look elsewhere . think this more kit than rack . $65 i paid it , if they only included 2 plastic coated steel grids it would well worth money . you use these few extra pieces wood make almost any kind rack you imagine . you use it upright ( 66 " tall ) or sideways ( 29 " tall ) , or good pair bolt cutters , you cut through 1/4 " rods make fit odd sized or shaped areas . again , price you aren't losing much if you throw away few pieces . it comes backets mount it up against wall , if you take approach , wall necessary becomes part rack . brackets place grids 5.5 " apart which designed support straight barrel part bottle . plastic coating racks makes them very slippery when contact glass bottles , so if front rear grids level , vibration over time might cause bottles fall out . becuase this , brackets designed hold front grid 1/4 " higher than rear grid . this means bottles slide back where wall stop them . that why wall important ! i put my rack basement where i didn't wall mount it . so i built couple wooden ends it few wood braces middle keep grids correct distance . i also placed grids 7 " apart instead 5.5 " brackets dictated , front grid same height rear grid . this allowed me store bottles bottom main barrel resting rear grid neck resting front grid . this position , part bottle hangs below grid wires so it can't slide forward or backward . it also places bottles slightly cork-down which some may argue better or worse than level or slightly cork up . i used pressure treated wood stailess steel deck screws stand up years humid cellar . i used nylon 1/4 " cable clamps attach grids wooden ends . i just cut some 1/4 " slots 7 " apart few pieces wood support middle keep grids right distance . any case , its great rack you make into just anything few pieces wood couple hours work . it won't hold larger bottles previous reviewer mentioned , but i plan just get smaller rack hold few bottles won't fit this one . it hard better this price	1

over years , my wife i tried all sorts cookware . we good set calphalon stainless-steel cookware , but we've never mastered art cooking sticky dishes such eggs without non-stick pan . we've tried every type non-stick pan we've encountered . some non-stick short time only before surface gets mucked up . our best teflon pans , such those calphalon , seem remain non-stick very long time careful cleaning , but recently we've learned when heated , teflon ( pfoa ) cookware outgases chemicals definitely not good you . ( advisory committee recommended epa classify pfoa possible carcinogen . ) swiss diamond pfoa-free fantastically non-stick . we've used our two skillets extensively cook eggs brown meat , they look work like new . nothing sticks . omelets easy prepare . cleanup breeze . lids vents opened or closed , useful feature . manufacturer says you use metal utensils , but we've stuck plastic , so i can't say how they'll hold up contact metal . i can't recommend swiss diamond cookware too highly . it stuff i've looking decades	1
