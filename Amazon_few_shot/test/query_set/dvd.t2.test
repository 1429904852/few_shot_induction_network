personally , i found 8 1/2 one most boring films i've ever seen . it pretentious , self-indulgent trip down director memory lane . i understood plot , enjoyed some thoughts raised near end , but overall bored silly stilted , pointless dialogue . said , cinematography stunning music almost made film worth watching . perhaps 8 1/2 would better off series photographs musical accompaniment :p	1
this one worst movies i ever seen . characters unlikeable except charity two friends . songs far too long i fast forward through most them because they so dull . i especially disappointed big spender because i love song expected spectacular dance number bob fosse all they stand there draped over bar . only redeeming factor sammy davis jr. it . he awesome even though song fairly stupid . this my first shirley maclaine film back it said sweet charity her best movie . i no desire see her other movies then	-1

unbearable lightness considered unfilmable novel good reason : point kundera writing not his plot - or even his characters - but his style . instances , his endless digressions history , politics , philosophy . movie , we left nothing but plot character . ok , what one ? itself wouldn't so bad if i didn't watch film constant thought : i could read book less time than it takes me watch this movie . this slow film . it takes hour-and-a-half story takes three hours tell it . i can't recommend film	1
transformers gets my vote worst movie 1980 . it pains me say this i am fan series . it travesty see optimus prime ( greatest transformers ) fall battle pass matrix leadership successor ( rodimus prime ) who proved incapable leadership . galvatron pathetic reincarnation megatron -- he lacked malevolent cunning megatron behaved like raving lunatic . why would decepticon warrior follow him into battle ? new generations autobots decepticons introduced movie , they forgettable . it amuses me " fans " raving movie now yet they not pay see movie when it released twenty years ago . transformers failed box office i am glad it . fan , i insulted . perhaps these other " fans " allowed nostalgia blind them ugly truth this outrage .	-1

i love this dvd . it very easy use you pre-program what workout you want , depending your time constraints , your own physical needs level . 1 . 20 minute cardio workout . i'm doing low intensity ( high intensity also available ) cardio i find it very enjoyable . i love all workouts this segment - those which include grapevine , shuffle , lunges , rainbow , almost all movements . even my 3-year old daughter loves them , so she imitates me while watching me workout . i went through high intensity me , low intensity lot more fun . 2 . 10 minute upper body . i'm also doing low intensity ( but dvd medium high too ) but instead chair , i use stability ball when i'm doing weights . i find it more flexible it ball than chair . 3 . 10 minute lower body . i don't consider my lower body main problem spot , so now , i skip this section due time constraints . that why this dvd so good , you choose what you want , depending your needs ! this also available low , medium high intensity . i went through section , though , find variety lower body exercises which i haven't seen some yet . i try this when i luxury time . ;-) 4 . 10 minute abs . this my problem spot so i always make it point this all time . this tough you would really feel it working all sections your abs . there lot variation basic crunches which i find very useful . i hope it works visibly , though ! i lot flab hiding my 6-pack . lol ! 5 . last segment stretching which basically usual stretching we see , but course , very important cool down . all all , i give this dvd 5+ stars easy use workouts doable but effective . i guess i'm fast becomming denise fan . i enjoy her workouts me her talkies not distracting . but if you get annoyed her voice , there also function play music only . buy this , it worth it	1

i first saw film theaters seen it several times since . it still breathtaking rivals newer nature films created big screen . movie contains drama , comic relief , action sadness . all emotions surround situation most planets large predators . film appropriate elementary students ( there one scene where you see main characters cheeks , however)to adults . some might call part story slow , but it reflects life . parts life not high action scenes . main character performs neat experiment testing observed diet wolves illustrating parts scientific method . one could good classroom discussion over this portion movie alone . music wonderful put memorable sound arctic my mind . price movie ecological must .	1
this show original idea , take old movies ham up language make them funny wacky . this whole show played max hokey . it aired 1960s ( those you under 45 may not want apply ) seeing it now dvd includes bit nostalgia watch these shows again . these shows played laughs , hans conreid , host , doing most this line play . explain theme this show , they took old movies lot effort created wacky dialogue " update " silents make plot (?) out them completely different thesis than silent movie once showed . i no idea how they found so many old movies " improve " , but it amusing then ( 60 , when this show aired ) watch this it now too . if you like rocky bullwinkle , you'll like this show essentially same group , uh , artisans (?) . it not seinfeld-style humor , nor stand-up comic humor , instead this sort very hokey , consciously self-pretentious , over-done sort humor makes you laugh much their silliness their puns their frankly funny adaptations old movies into absurdities dubbed dialogue . it interesting combination old silent movies added-on dialogue . not everyone , great some us .	1
michael moriarity my hero ! he just one coolest actors my opinion . he such great b-movies this , , it alive 3 : island alive . how awesome he ?? anyways , i think this movie hilarious ! i think lot people take this movie too seriously , thinking it going your typical movie . but you shouldn't because not only this b-movie , but it supposed funny . my favorite part when " stuff " started bubbeling out ground old hick guy just starts eating it . who would ?? i just started laughing butt off when happened . so if you watch this movie , just sit back enjoy it what it worth , don't too critical it . what i learned stuff : dairy products evil ! especially if they come earth ! if you like stuff , i recommend : watching other b-movies , such island alive 3 , zombi 3 4 , etc	1

this collection definitely worth any remington steele fan , but last two seasons series together one set , it very uneven package . if i could break it down , i would give 5 stars season 4 , 2 stars season 5 , 3 stars extras . season 4 not best series . show already passed its peak , but it still quite good . season some classic episodes , including " beg , borrow or steele , " which laura mr. steele presumed dead mildred arrested their murder , " dancer , prancer , donner steele , " christmas episode which gang taken hostage bunch santas , " sensitive steele , " most in-depth exploration relationship we ever get show . other episodes like " coffee , tea , or steele , " " steele blushing , " " steele your service , " " forged steele , " " steele running " very strong well . even weaker episodes like " suburban steele " " steele inc . " their moments . although some other reviewers pointed out , series started look more dated less " classic " fourth year , overall , it still its trademark charm , wit , sophistication . character development season 4 , mildred discovers secret mr. steele invented miss holt , so dynamic among three changes bit . relationship laura mr. steele also develops little over course season , but usual this show , we given just enough make us want more , never enough satisfy . often referred show " foreplay , " rs delivers not delivering . season 4 provides plenty little romantic moments keep us intrigued couple -- we even see them admitting other people they're " committed " each other -- but they still never consummate relationship . yes , some complained , if you think it , it bizarre two healthy adults could such hot heavy romance four years still remain chaste , but you're not really supposed think it too much . that why , few exceptions , only minute or two per episode devoted relationship . tease , perhaps , start wear little thin season 4 . if show continued full year , some point they would fish or cut bait relationship . but me , amazing chemistry pierce brosnan stephanie zimbalist keeps me coming back more throughout fourth season , even when i realize i'm played little writers who wanted their cake eat it too . time we reach fifth season , however , everything changed . others mentioned , show cancelled after fourth season , most things come back dead , it never same again . mercifully short fifth season very " we don't want here " feel it . exotic locations serve poor substitutes good story-telling character development . plots become thin tedious . humor goes clever overly silly farcical . characters inconsistent previous seasons . inclusion jack scalia ( tony ) cast totally throws off dynamic worked so well what classy , silver-screen-inspired romantic duet . basically , show lost its heart . fans not get emotionally satisfying ending , it still makes me little bitter after all these years . extras same other seasons , just little less . i know you can't expect much extras such old show , well , you don't get much . there few featurettes okay . farewell steele one make me very nostalgic sad see series come end ( again ) . i give extras three stars instead two , because these featurettes , especially because they able get interviews all three stars . that probably big coup such old show . what i didn't care much extras episode commentaries . i already mentioned this my review season 3 , but i really wish whoever charge putting together extras dvds like this would send commentors copy ahead time so they could take 45 minutes watch show before doing commentary it . it not interesting listen people guessing plot points they don't remember episode you just watched . you expect hear something interesting , it little insulting viewer commentors ramble , laugh in-jokes , constantly interrupt each other , etc . -- basically terrible job . what even more annoying one commentary guy who actually joked what bad job they doing . yes , it hilarious waste time people who support show who spent good money these dvds . anyway , i'm not saying there not some good bits information commentaries , but they're few far . overall , though , disappointing final season poor commentary skills people involved series take away little these dvds or series whole . it great whole set , wealth wonderful episodes -- all 94 -- right there nice , convenient package , return whenever i want . but i'm also little wistful this last set . seeing my favorite childhood show dvd first time close i ever get recapturing magic watching it when it originally aired . now i've savored every episode -- good , bad , big-haired--it sad say goodbye again	1

i origionaly didn't want watch this film i mean come film starring sandra bullock but it my girlfriend who suggested i watch this film said i might like it now i admit it pretty good . sandra bullock plays woman named birdee pruitt who believes happy perfect life until she appears national television hears her best friend confessing affair her husband . she then leaves her married home travels her birth place texas where she begins rebuild her life relationships especialy her mother young daughter who hates birdee . i surprised film didn't any cliche hollywood moments it dealt human emotions realistic , birdee overcome humiliation public betrayal she obviously lot problems but soon harry connick jr. ' character comes hopefully win birdee heart since they knew each other highschool . film very uplifting way it serious romantic drama bit humor so i enjoyed this film alot i didn't hesitate fact i like sandy these roles everybody else gave great performance i hope she stars more films like this instead those awful comedies , i highly recomend this film	1

japanese-american raised 1960 , i always mixed feelings 1961 film version rodgers hammerstein chinese-american musical comedy . although it refreshing see so many asian faces mainstream studio movie ( granted several japanese-american actors chinese roles ) , portrayals always struck me trite catering pre-existing stereotypes . now it finally come out dvd forty-five years after its initial release , i appreciate it much more without raising my eyebrows much , perhaps because it now seems so much nostalgic product eisenhower-era sensibilities . reason dvd contains pristine print balances saturated use color throughout . moreover , there music , which while not grade-a material legendary team , enough their recognizably melodious style make whole affair quite entertaining now . set san francisco chinatown late 1950 , souffl�-light story , written joseph fields , family-oriented , musical-chairs romantic comedy focused east-west cultural differences primarily well-to-do wang household headed ultra-traditional master wang . it starts pretty mei li , who stowed away chinese steamer her professor father become mail-order bride nightclub owner sammy fong . en route , they end up staying wang home where she develops crush eldest son wang ta . but he infatuated saucy showgirl linda low , who intent making sammy jealous enough him propose after five years non-commitment . wang ta linda turn out mismatch , which would good news if only mei li marriage contract not so binding . if situation not complicated enough , dressmaker doormat helen chao lifelong crush wang ta well . all-asian cast assembled , rarity itself back then , it helps most perform within constraints movie quite well . looking like porcelain doll brought life , miyoshi umeki lends her uniquely plaintive quality role mei li , she sings quiet clarity her trademark song , " hundred million miracles " . wang ta , james shigeta , also pleasant singer , sincere matinee idol looks match , although his na�ve character seems excessively dim when it comes women . both , however , overshadowed shenanigans provided nancy kwan , her pin-up cutie peak , linda , jack soo full dean martin mode cynical sammy . even though their stormy relationship seems lifted completely nathan adelaide " guys dolls " , they provide lion share entertainment domestic fantasy , " sunday " particular highlight . while dubbed , kwan performs boudoir classic , " i enjoy girl " , sexy flair , she dances graceful exuberance " fan tan fannie " especially " grand avenue " virtual battalion dancers . benson fong , who memorably played charlie chan #3 son his youth , brings necessary bluster master wang , while juanita hall , bloody mary " south pacific " , stays mainly sidelines understanding auntie liang except when she solos " chop suey " . supporting cast , two performers stand out - teenaged patrick adiarte dancing energetically younger son wang tan , lovelorn helen , reiko sato leads stunning ballet show best song , " love , look away " ( her voice dubbed legendary soprano marilyn horne ) . opening credits showcase series striking watercolor paintings artist dong kingman , russell metty richly colorful cinematography finally appreciated dvd . 2006 dvd extras generous starting solid commentary track kwan british film historian nick redman . even though kwan sometimes gets derailed her life story , she redman partner well bringing out intriguing aspects production cast . there five featurettes which feel like components one feature-length documentary since same participants show up all five . first one talks story transition original novel c.y. lee broadway musical directed gene kelly 1961 movie 2002 broadway revival developed david henry hwang . other shorts focus casting , score , sets costumes , more personal look rodgers hammerstein . it interesting how veteran filmmaker henry koster barely mentioned since he directed film , though his pedestrian direction truly least impressive part movie	1
great performance who , although they pinch less-rehearsed here ( this 1999 gig one very first times , if not first time , who stripped away all extra brass , backup singers , second guitar extra percussion ) than they reunion arena dallas , texas , aug . 27 , 2000 , but they still rocked . i could used little more camera angles john entwistle ( rip ) , last half or third show seems concentrate more townshend daltrey . but still great show . band fighting form , even amid couple goofs - daltrey early entrance near end " anyway , anyhow , anywhere , " townshend breaking two or three strings during show , keeping soundman bobby pridden hopping stratocasters hand . who still best band around . this show , seemingly short around 90 minutes , would morph into 2000 tour , which would group best post-keith moon tour . i agree previous reviewer . lack special guests ( i love paul weller/the jam ) makes this dvd favorite . it interesting townshend daltrey seem almost feuding this show . townshend makes fun daltrey messing his inner-ear sound monitors near end show , telling audience , " thanks letting us experiment you . well , some us experimenting . " who still rock , although they're not quite strong when ox thumped bass them ( or when moonie drummer ) , but they're still greatest live band now . beginners should pick up " kids alright " dvd first , then move this video " live isle wight 1970 " ( 2006 version two bonus songs ) dvd . boston 2002 dvd , released late 2004 first tour new bassist pino palladino , good , but maybe not best starting point potential ' oo heads . 2000 royal albert hall dvd ( released fall 2001 ) good too , " concert new york city , " where who four-song set worth price admission alone ! who rocks . can't wait see them dallas seven days	1

fifth season tales crypt started off bang , every single episode first disc leaves you eerie feeling endings episodes you can't forget . then towards middle , it kind fizzles little never gets quite good episodes beginning season . this season really feature gore , especially first few episodes season i talking . forever ambergris alone extreme gore i loved it ! this season definitely worth getting better than season three four overall . there also abundance stars this season ; john stamos , steve buscemi , tim curry even trek stars wheaton ( wesley crusher next generation ) robert picardo ( doctor star trek : voyager ) make appearance this season . extras few ; virtual comic book " death some salesmen " , but it really cool extra . john kassir , cryptkeeper , narrates comic book episode based while comic shown . i really enjoyed it ! overall , this definite must fans ! i just hope they continue virtual comic book episode next two seasons well , it awesome .	1

don't want create war previous reviewer , but after watching this fun flick last night , i throw my 2 cents . if you looking deep , touching , sensitive moving film then don't bother this one ( cover art clearly shows you what expect ) . also if you're kind person who doesn't appreciate beauty dirty joke , then move something else . now if you looking something different , hysterical , funny , then buy this now ! we ( myself 6 friends ) watched this last night we laughing so hard we crying . fact , we pause it several times we couldn't control our laughter we missing continuing dialogue . i think that what this film all ......... fun entertaining . i don't think writers/producers/directors/actors high hopes oscar . too clarify my rebuttal my title ...... " america prove british approach " ...... these artists took comedy ala benny hill but gay twist it .	1
i know it probably all said , but yes , i extremely disappointed not see original ending included movie . so i watched extras , shivering anticipation this mythical " original ending . " let down again ! we aren't even given final version ! bah ! sorry , but i've always rooted duckie . he least deserved some screen time dancing his true love . but- it still great movie , other extras quite satisfying , such " favorite scenes " which includes duckie infectious dance try little tenderness fight duckie steff ( you love shot duckie peering over edge balcony down steff , staring him down look death ) . i really disappointed not hear james spader extras . he always my favorite jerk . " you got problem , friend ? " those linen suits penny loafers no socks ?! i just can't get enough his smug , self-satisfied rich boy . also , hearing cast talking john hughes ' behind scenes- directing interesting . you see how he got most his actors . more i watch this movie , more i am convinced there never stronger teenage actress than likes molly ringwald . her pout , her passion , her fury- quintessential redhead . " what prom , blane ?! " so , conclusion , dvd worth watching ( or renting ) but i don't feel need replace my vhs copy just yet	1
first , i didn't break sweat , i would consider myself intermediate aerobic area . second , music not music . it someone synthesizer hammering out lame " latin-esqe " beat . i looking good some fun inspiring latin music well this not it . it sooooo cheesy . this dvd * might * good very early beginner or someone who trying learn english second language ( dvd bilingual ) . other than , i can't see much use	-1
when 4 boys stan , kyle , cartman kenny sneek into r-rated canadian animated flick featuring their two favorite canadian heroes known terrence philip they start repeat extremely foul language movie . kyle mother starts blame makers movie canada what it all kids south park , now canada begins go war against america , there prophecy once terrence philip executed then satan saddam hussan take over world but only south park kids stop this happening . one most brilliant funniest animated movies all time ! this not kids stuff here folks , there lots extreme foul language graphic animated violence , sexual jokes bodily functions galore . cut-out animation blended cgi just good show humor sick but funny , there some musical numbers like memorable " shut your face uncle-f'er " film twisted yet comical view censorship . dvd great picture sound but only extras three trailers , nevertheless this must animated movie but keep your kids away this movie	1

ok iam going honest . i don't dvd i've never watched it , but what i tell you this . instructor this dvd ( roger ) one kind dancer . i kno this because i've seen him perform new york city time square train station . oh my god !!! what performance . he doing dance sequence mime . it just touched you right heart soul . you just wanted start moving pop locking like he . i only give such vague description , because his performance too astonishing put into words . i hooked so much onto it i just see it again . so i made detour brooklyn times square just see it again , boy it make my day . it music background moves impersenations everyday life he expressing his dance just created right vibe . if you want see yourself just go times square trainstation right train he should there . or call him this number ( i just get his card ) he perform you special occasion : ( 201)- 568-3661 or ( 201)-562-5529 . peace brooklyn	1
i think anthony hopkins gives terrific portrayal paul ( not i've ever met paul .... :) he brings lot character i never really considered reading bible . he great job " humanizing " paul . paul such tremendous apostle start christian church . i think hopkins given us , this film , look paul truly shows his human side . i tried understand what might paul " thorn flesh . " maybe it his arrogance ( he stated himself ) . i've always thought it possibly some physical impairment but after seeing this movie , maybe it more pride , etc . interesting perspective . anyway , i highly recommend movie . it shows some what bible describes relationship peter paul . film stays pretty close what bible describes ( certainly taking little artistic license ) filling some places . even though very well .	1

olivia really first queen music video . olivia first artist film music video each track studio album ( physical ) .. olivia sexy , sultry made some great dance tracks 80s . like madonna , she would reinvent herself .. late 1970 , she came scene " innocent country girl " many hits such please , mister , please you ever mellow ( which , surprised me , not video clip included video gold dvds-i'm sure there footage her out there performing this song tv show like dinah shore , johnny carson or merv griffin ) .. then , her good girl gone bad role greatest broadway film version grease , olivia used role help reinvent herself into sexy , sultry pop performer song little more love her totally hot crossover country pop release .. she then starred futuristic disco movie xanadu recorded some her best work elo backing her movie title track , suddenly magic ... then , she moved into 1980 great physical album new look utilized music videos promote album . she even great concert aired pay tv ( i remember it pay station called preview ( this pre-cable sattelite = now , i'm dating myself ) , which clips it found these two dvds . then , olivia released greatest hits , vol . 2 tow awesome tracks tied up heart attack . almost simultaneously , i remember olivia starred travolta movie two kind olivia recorded some her best work soundtrack ( twist fate) = but something , or someone happened ... madonna !!!! madonna new face body full sexuality new sound .... yes , olivia try go toe toe her sexy soul kiss release , but songs weren't good ( mostly becuase her best songwriter , john farrar wasn't mix much new material ) i just remember culture shock just wierd song felt like it " shocking " song used out desperation compete likes madonna ... rumour kool , penned elton john so can't we talk it over bed = olivia toned down her sexy image her soul kiss days = she remained sexy , but started throw some her " innocence " again ... later 90 , she released warm tender , going back her " innocence " days ... then , later 90 put out great hits package awesome dance track i need love .. why she didn't release full studio album material like this , i don't know = it surely would made her come back strong dance charts could up there cher ... finally , she went back country remade i honestly love you .... so , all this , olivia definately one original divas ... she her time place made pop history her great music innovative , pioneer her music videos . i think olivia should dance album use songwriters producers currently worked cher kylie minogue = = if she , i feel it would make her megastar again put her top again ... oh , yeah , dvds ... i psyched when i saw these store !!!! it 99% her hits ( like i said before , doesn't include you ever mellow ) ... but , i complete collection physical , twist fate soul kiss videos , plus other promo videos clips her olivia live concert paytv .. i loved olivia , i still play these dvds alot . i actually give these dvds 10 stars !!!!.. they memory lane me -- time before madonna heyday mtv .. olivia original video diva !!!	1

there old saying , if you nothing nice say , say nothing all . but i feel compelled critique this film , partly because i really liked what i think it trying say ... follow your heart , not what necessarily popular , follow bohemian lifestyle if what makes you happy . o.k. this film instead comes across one produced major corporation get us all thinking heading back home suburbs . because really what it saying even if you all idealism world , it only land you ghost town like woodstock , n.y. , full self doubt , hypocritical trappings . first all acting not bad , i no issues acting . fact other fine actors this film , colin farrell should angry . their true abilities developing characterization seem written , directed , edited right out this film . there little or no subjective viewpoint these characters lives . viewer left outside looking , wondering where these characters coming , or what they motivated . this film forces us assume everything order believe anything , without dramatizing or exemplifying why these characters feel way they . effect clear , screen-writer director apparently anesthetized these characters into poseurs masked sterotypes ; only thing left certain , only thing derived , they truly believe hair color , haircuts , one-night stands . " home end world , " wants us believe it making liberal statement , wants us swallow whole enchilida . using home metaphor terminal disease create sympathy itself , what this film really lead us down road good intentions home decorated bad taste .	1
because i regular working rounds marvel , i heard there company never happy this animated show . mostly change most charecters teens only logan remain adult compromise made marvel , animation studio made this show , wb network . avi arad never happy it after three seasons decited cut show out it contract , even though there more shows ready made , since it not fit wtth marvel future projects , it made lame duck voted out office ( use political saying )	-1

this amazing work art . must buy anyone who loves westerns . ( anyone who loves sergio leone already it . ) documentary interesting also . it all testosterone , however , so if you not like sort thing ( not necessarily your " chick " ) , you hate this movie not appreciate art . if you liked clint eastwood westerns ( especially good , bad , ugly , leone ) , this your next step . big characters big themes , big , but beautifully well . note : sound synch off my disk words not match lips . may part original , however , they not record sound set . not watch lips or you driven distraction	1
john barrymore over-the-top reading egomaniacal producer oscar jaffe absolutely brilliant howard hawks ' screwball farce . you basically just sit back awe barrymore improvises variety histrionics , facial contortions , animal noises , etc . times i thought he throes dts . if you find fault film story struck me little thin , despite adapted stage play charles mcarthur ben hecht . also , i thought carole lombard , lovely she former lingeree salesgirl turned toast-of-broadway , came off little shrill . it seems like she trying go toe-to-toe barrymore but didn't comiedic chops work . falls short classic status but deinitely should checked out barrymore performance	1
i think people way too hard this film . main reason people don'tlike it because they expecting lucas just remake original trilogy . what people not understand this entirely differnt galaxy we . entire galaxy changed enter episode iv . people don't understand it differnt age . only thing wrong this movie gungans , very minor annoyance	1

i thought this comes out movie muslim considering ways west finding them bitter sweet best . women often try take additional man prove themselves ennui they feel home not their fault alone . what happens they need theory life religiously , socially or nationally approved set rules management details . without such code we find out men get better without women around save they vile know something missing . take feminism british men can't bear responsibilities women regularly carry out respecting spouse career . woman talented but man just himself . my suggestion characters would bit humility less rage what they little ability change . they both people worth . perhaps back music jay perform , manage or teach perhaps writing or directing would suit claire	1

1950 version " king solomon mines " deserves full 5 stars if only one reason -- it one few movies even this day which set africa , filmed africa , features actual africans portraying africans . particular , dance scene near end almost quality ethnographic film , worth watching itself because lead dancer one finest you ever see . while it true this movie barely same story . rider haggard novel , only good thing , book racist unbelievably sexist even 19th century standards . plot indeed full adventure , but there several points where descriptions game hunting ( without even taking trophies ! literally no reason ! ) made me nauseous . all means , read it get taste 19th century british attitudes toward their colonies . it ain't pretty , today standards . whether you love or hate plot movie , this film , its way , little piece history . it true african actors aren't main stars movie ( though some them so charismatic they steal their scenes ) . but lest we forget , 1932 , only 18 years before , edward . robinson loretta young , boris karloff myrna loy all played chinese people ( " hatchet man " " mask fu manchu " respectively ) because god forbid hollywood would actually cast chinese actors . it would long time before african or african-american actor would considered big enough star draw mainly white audiences , but " ksm " step right direction it lot more engrossing movie because it	1
i not into this movie all . my mother recommended it me but it lame all way through . middle-aged man decides he wants something different his life , so he takes dance class . ofcourse there fine dance instructor , crush pursued , wife gets jealous , hires detective , * gasp * his crush found out . movie too predictable it just wasn't me . not bad movie , just not my cup tea . richard gere cute usual , which only thing made me watch it end , besides wanting know what correct quick step looked like since " so you think you dance " never contestants who mastered it	1

grudge american remake japanese horror film . what different grudge it non-linear story line . first you think it three separate stories , then just two , finally you realize your seeing interspersed storylines past present they meet end film -- filling you curse what happening . ( think momento identity)the scariest part story , it pretty creepy , because curse born first murder kills indescriminately anyone who enters house . not immediately . not same way . no matter what you , you can't outwit it . if you house , it got your number . scariest thing most people involved innocent -- they nothing original killing , when seeing ghost while shocked , they tried help . yet , still they died . there might way avoid curse but unfortunately , it didn't get carried ou t.t here no cgi/fx -- everything low key creepy . i'd almost say this more psychological horror than monster coming get you horror but never they less -- you'll probably end up sleeping lights wondering if you should evere go into house you don't know anything again	1
this movie both entertaining times , hilarious . charlie sheen great fallen stockbroker turned advice columnist , denise richards funny his ditzy , shallow girlfriend angie harmon appealing editor newspaper . also , jon lovitz hysterical sheen plastic surgeon best friend . this movie must those who want some lighthearted humor . i highly recommend it .	1

many ways , i don ' think sound exaggerate affirm it . day lives these emblematic integrants most famous band history , perhaps under perspective more than forty years elapsed , it may seen na�f picture if you want , but you should turn back needles watch set right moment ; perhaps most important aspect remark it allowed establish first possibility expression backstage , eventually would open gates future documents enormous historical transcendence .	1

biggest problem most people king kong its length , so there no surprise reaction general public release extended edition 3 hour-plus peter jackson film almost equivalent collective groan . surprise everything added extended edition king kong should never cut . more dinosaurs more creatures more action skull island only improves film , one wonders if these scenes cut mostly time pacing , why wasn't little bit 51 minutes pre-skull island snipped or perhaps few overly drawn scenes kong anna gazing into each other eyes ? more noticable scenes rampaging ceratops fun scene underwater monster attacking adrien brody co . while they rafting down river . bit more character development some seedy behavior carl denham ( jack black ) heroic deeds jack driscoll shipmates add bit flavor male characters literally overshadowed kong film . spider pit sequence also bit lengthened some more lines jack black . overall , worthy 13 minutes added material , but film still feels too long last act . special features this extended edition special features missing first release kong movie , including commentary peter jackson extensive behind scenes features , describing making kong concept artwork screen la performance andy serkis . i enjoyed extended cut , but i don't know this lengthy movie better served added material . it not like lotr films where additions enhance your viewing understanding tolkien world . but hey , i am not going complain more dinosaurs raft sequence i disappointed missing original cut	1
otto preminger directs this 1944 noir thriller starring gene tierney dana andrews . dana andrews plays mcpherson , hard-boiled detective investigating shocking murder society woman , laura , new york . mcpherson focuses waldo lydecker ( clifton webb ) , sardonic sophisticate who writes newspaper column radio talk show . lydecker good friend laura but despised her playboy fiancee shelby ( vincent price ) . process investigation mcpherson falls love laura portrait . fortunately mcpherson , laura returns -- apparently body girl found apartment not laura ! filming this story gorgeous black white cunningly utlized shadow threatens characters -- or reveals their underlying motivation . dana andrews ' curt athletic interpretation detective contrasts nicely talented vincent price who plays spoiled rich boy . clifton webb nice job poisonous , dried-out sophisticate . gene tierney laura gorgeous , charming elegant . unfortunately her character weakens rather than strengthens throughout film . laura starts out assertive individualist who challenges values sophisticated society . end film she docile female who found her man . story little melodramatic , all loose ends tied up too neatly -- good noir thriller leaves some mysteries unsolved . also , theme song little saccharine too often played . nevertheless well worth seeing enjoying	1

i first heard jean-claude brisseau secret things eminent film critic roger ebert , who reviewed movie one episode his ebert roeper show gave it thumbs-up , saying it one those rare erotic films also well-made fascinating . 19-year-old horny college student myself ( hehehe ) , i became rather interested seeing this film when it came out dvd . now i , my reactions it decidedly mixed . i frustrated while watching it , but after it over i rather admired it its sheer ambition . secret things basically two women attempt try climb up business ladder company seducing their way up . seems like simple-enough plot ... except , hands brisseau , it leads twists turns best described surreal over-the-top . what turns out unassuming little drama sex power becomes what you might call morality play , one heavy atmosphere symbolism . who would known scene which one characters sits chair her office quietly masturbates front her boss would eventually lead scene set what seems like some kind mansion/dungeon which lot people engage mass orgy ? it wasn't i necessarily minded brisseau blatant descent into this kind expressionism ; my problem simply much it came seem too pretentious . increasingly heavy-handed dialogue , portentous baroque music soundtrack , all-to o-o bvious symbol woman draped black bird her right shoulder --- all reeked writer-director seemed too much love his own wit . there clever , then there too clever , brisseau flirts frequently coming off too clever his own good : all self-conscious trickery risks obscuring whatever message he trying convey . it if he laughing fate his own characters , keeping his emotional distance he eventually destroys them . all may sound like i not like this movie very much . yet , after i finished watching it reflected bit upon it , i realized what perhaps brisseau getting all this over-the-top style . movie first seems female empowerment , two main female characters nathalie ( coralie revel ) sandrine ( sabrina seyvecou ) hatch their scheme try get top . but secret things turns out something little more universal little less gender-specific : it how quest power corrupt soul , make you little less human . perhaps it telling sandrine , who admits she never come man , finally reaches orgasm evil christophe ( fabrice deville ) , arrogant , cocky young ladykiller who all set inherit business his ailing father . sandrine herself gone so far her quest climb corporate ladder process she loses her innocence ideals love rejects delacroix ( roger mirmont ) , her boss office , mere " weakling " instead realizing he truly love her . nathalie , other hand , starts out cynical love movie , but slowly starts shedding cynicism she starts falling love herself . ending film , contrary what some people said it , perfectly logical context brisseau exploration search power highlighting dark night human soul . end , i began put pieces this movie together , i began develop some more admiration what brisseau pulled off secret things . power corrupting force not breathtakingly original theme movies ( look what happened tony montana brian de palma scarface ) , but brisseau explores it daring , boldly original , even relevant , way certainly fascinate you even if it occasionally frustrates you . most viewers probably find this film overheated almost insufferably pretentious ; but , look little deeper , perhaps style film its substance come together way make you respect it , if not necessarily love it . i think secret things worth look , despite reservations .	1

raging bull #24 100 best american movies ever , it among 1000 best movies dvd peter travers . later named best movie decade ( 80 ) , which i think true . i rate this movie 5 stars or 9.5 /10 . it nominated eight 1980 oscars , but won only two : de niro best actor , thelma schoonmaker her editing ( academy seems problem scorsese ) . schoonmaker appears one audio commentaries movie , martin scorsese , producer , real lamotta others . this dvd exactly what we collectors like special edition dvds . package beautifully ( yes ! package matters lot ) , containing small booklet some short essays pictures movie . then , this special edition comes second dvd full special features , such 4 behind-the-scenes featurettes , making documentary , trailers , some other very interesting stuff . this movie masterpiece . acting perfect , i don't only mean de niro , who got oscar this role my opinion one best actors ever , but joe pesci , who always sensational , cathy moriarty role vickie . shooting black white very wise decision , photography michael chapman , music ( cavalleria rusticana fits perfectly ) , editing got oscar also great job well , story , screenplay , even fight scenes just absolutely amazing ( i just hate violence ... ) . new york times put it " though it movie full anger nonstop physical violence , effect or raging bull lyrical " . i recommend this movie absolutely everybody . you like it sure . if you , get this special edition ( though while i am writing this review , it looks it not available anymore amazon ) . p.s. if you like my review vote yes . you read all my other reviews if you wish . i modestly write them help people form opinion movies , music books , but if nobody reads them ( if you don't vote i not know if you ) there no point writing them : -	1
flatliners horrific exploration after-death experiences , directed taut suspense joel schumacher ( client , batman forever , lost boys ) . it five medical students led kiefer sutherland ( lost boys ) carelessly experimenting death . each wants turn one time they bring each other brink their medical know-how , reviving volunteer within seconds - first , then daring each other go longer periods minutes . after sutherland experience he finds child his past haunting him , but hides his hallucinations others . william baldwin ( backdraft ) goes next , after his experience he sees reflections his sins - selfish promiscuity , primarily - everywhere around him . kevin bacon ( river wild , white water summer , stir echoes ) next , before results first two revealed , then julia roberts ( pretty woman , conspiracy theory ) , who insists her turn spite growing fears others . fifth member their group oliver platt ( simon birch , time kill ) . original idea , time film created , fascinating well scary , precursor such later efforts white noise . unfortunately there great deal foul language , considerable violence , unnecessary sex partial nudity ( particularly illustration baldwin case ) . i say " unfortunately " because otherwise i'd like show film everyone , idea so good , effectively delivers good message - " everything we matters .

" ring two " stars naomi watts david dorfman reprising their roles rachel aiden keller , family plagued samara morgan , demon child created video tape after death showed horrifying images killed viewers seven days after they watch it . original met great praise , labeled critics scariest movie since " exorcist " " rosemary baby " , even though i didn't find it scary all , just good mystery . " ring two " , rachel aiden moved new town , evidence arises local death may caused mysterious video tape . this inspires rachel , reporter , investigate . most critics don't like this film because it doesn't " atmosphere " original . since i've read books now how vastly different first second , i didn't expect it . you can't expect it , anyway , seeing how they two different directors . i'm quite sure this movie would better if gore verbinski direct , but studio hired director japanese film . it didn't work " grudge " it didn't work this , but it turned out better than what i expected . " ring " mystery video tape revealed , including where it came history who made it . ( though i admit , they could explained it better . book . ) " ring two " , we know what there fear so all there left throw it us see what happens . they try something new though , slightly resembles what occurs very end book , but much different happens middle . i didn't like how they just threw idea samara adopted us . i wish they explained it . they also kind overexagerated water . after fact villain later revealed , it kind makes sense but not really . i just hope fans react " dark water " well when they see it . i also really liked scene end well . there seems scene like end both them , one shocks you makes you flip out . ( first where she crawls out tv . ) all all , it very cool movie , one better ones i've seen recently . i'd give it 10/10 because it everything i thought it should . they close it off , but i still expect third . why wouldn't they it ?	1

this film creates impossible challenge this reviewer : convince one how important , even essential , movie coming terms not only modern art , but modern sensibility generally -- without however destroying wonder just viewing it . state ask trust , although such trust somewhat necessitated context : major american abstract-expressionist artist deserved reputation , although reputation virtually entirely established art world insiders would never established -- then , now , or perhaps forever -- general public . thus importance this film subject rests not only identity painter -- whose work and/or life one may or may not like -- but phenomenon elite art culture our time its paradoxical dominance wide open , democratic society such world never before known . there key paradox : film succeeds because aesthetic entirely opposed its subject : american realism . it if john huston or john ford persuaded make movie . obviously no one their type interested , so ed harris step it himself besides playing mercurial artist . couse he entirely uncannily subsumed role degree which just plain -- -- -- well , i cannot say it without destroying part your experience . please let harris it you himself . also marcia hartley who , turn , uncannily subsumed lee krasner . everybody else this picture , too . much commentary here amazon.com everywhere reflects fact our nation still often recoils realism , perhaps never happily embrace it . it our nation greatest gift , course , all artistic fields -- figures working against tide like pollack only underscore fact . however his artistic values , however abstract , really close 1st cousin -- absolute integrity emotion . you take or leave , too , there doubtless good arguments against it ( classic argument balance distance -- see titian portait doge venice , or sir joshua reynolds painting country squire ) but if you interested all american art or culture you better sooner or later know what counter view , just like you cannot study our history if you only read washingtons roosevelts , not custers or lee harvey oswalds . sum , without pasting too may more words over this immense wonder film , not assume it too overwhelming seen . just pick good night without distractions when you open i	1

moonlighting television show premiered march 3 1985 carried channel abc . it lasted through five seasons . moonlighting perfect example how good writing , talent chemistry come through tv viewers wanting more more one show . moonlighting also perfect example how top show reach bottom fail further please audiences , due lack commitment well evaporation magic chemistry . it long awaited event fans throughout world . moonlighting finally out dvd . personally , i it my videotaped versions show . i needed relive magic show beginning through help digital version . episodes run very wonderful it pleasure hear crystal clear musical theme every beginning . picture crystal clear audio digital stereo ( not 5.1 surround it stated technical characteristics ) . still , some points you notice audio changing stereo mono stereo again . issue comes up this dvd collection two first seasons fact some episodes altered . it seems ridiculous episodes altered when transferring dvd especially if you examine reason this . example , episode " funeral doornail " sex shop scene , there furniture superimposed front maddie moment she reading dirty magazine . clearly there no reason type censoring because front page magazine visible bit offensive prudish back `80s . there legal issue magazine this time around ? one only speculate . why they provide us classic episode " lady iron mask " newly recorded soundtrack ? it difficult gain rights musical themes played original episode ? people who new moonlighting such issues may trivial , but people who fond memories tv series such things matter . so what we ? we so anxious release moonlighting so we not stopped such minor technicalities . i rushed bought dvd collection two first seasons soon i could , not mention i already pre-ordered season 3 . no true fan left behind such treat their favourite television show . i need advertise show ? people who familiar there no reason all . this show many fans through out globe . i need advertise show younger unfamiliar generations ? surely enough saying television dialogue , character development television entertainment its best rolled into this old series . we only hope future episodes all restored their original form further more , there deleted scenes , there teaser 15 30 second tv ads much , much more . second time around doing professional job inclusion all this trivia because i am almost certain like me , great deal fans buy them all over again . just try keep away anniversary editions appear every five years include new item recently discovered . pretty much , i feel we all it predatory marketing started business trend during late `90s	1
this dvd compiles all . . . ' videos i.r.s. , well handful tv appearances . basically everything previously released succumbs vhs here , then some . " wolves , lower " performance video . this one suffers very low-budget appearance , but it rare interesting glimpse band its earliest stage . this only video until 1991 which michael lip-synched shoot . " radio free europe " appears here two versions , one some live footage cut one without . non-live footage shows band rev . howard finster paradise gardens georgia , which filled howard folk art massive junk sculptures .

" radio free europe ( live tube , 11.18.83 ) " " talk passion ( live tube , 11.18.83 ) " good performances band playing well . these nice because michael adds extra or different lyrics each song . " so . central rain ( i'm sorry ) " performance video band playing they stand behind backlit screens we mostly see their shadows . michael center attention only one not behind screen . he sings shyly his eyes closed . " left reckoning " 20 minute super 8 film shows band wandering around field full whirligigs ( building some their own , well ) . there lot unique start-and-stop editing makes film kind engaging . this set first half reckoning lp . " pretty persuasion ( live old grey whistle test , 11.20.84 ) " good performance , although not one better fashion statements guys . michael wears wristwatch necktie bill looks like french waiter . " can't get there here " hilarious due its ( purposely ? ) bad effects . band go drive-in movie get into popcorn fight . other odd images include michael greeting passers atop fruit stand band dressed bird costumes or playing horns . " driver 8 " kind boring video but interesting because there films projected wall behind band , much like they live shows . there lot railroad footage video go train-related lyrics . " life how live it " " feeling gravitys pull " sort part same video , which simply some very raw super 8 footage band performing one their live gigs . same editing style " left reckoning " .

skipping past my silly title , i actually liked this movie over arnold schwarzenegger first " predator . " while arnold incredible physique , danny glover more down-to-earth rely his wits more than arnold . danny glover plays maverick cop vein harry callahan clint eastwood dirty harry movies . danny hunts down columbian drug lords he runs across alien predator also hunting same columbian drug lords . while danny should happy someone else taking out columbian drug lords , apparently danny would rather it police instead alien hunter , so soon danny finds himself trail alien . original " predator " number plot holes easy ignore because nearly non-stop action . " predator 2 " even more plot holes , occasionally they intrude into action enough you pay attention them . perhaps biggest plot hole arrogance stupidity gary bussey government agent peter keyes . it seems action movies feds always end up portrayed too good everyone own good , including their own . if gary his team technologically astute they appeared , they should recognized alien could see their lights meat locker . while particular incident may biggest plot hole , there number others occasionally distracting i leave viewer discover . real charm this movie danny physically not match predator , thus must rely his intelligence thwart predator . predator clearly its own arrogance , which it ultimately pays , but way interaction glover alien provide some very good scenes . one scene predator danny glover very bad situation . danny able make use alien high tech boomerang weapon cut off alien hand . alien escapes into building across way . using cool looking colander alien mixes little glass some other ingredients make kind patch stub his arm . noise alien makes it puts molten glass ceramic its arm scares little old lady her bed , providing funny moment alien leaps out lady bathroom then her apartment , soon followed danny glover , who meantime found clever way get two apartment buildings . " predator 2 " not quite slick first " predator , " plot holes bigger . all , i thought " predator 2 " achieved more potential alien hunter than first movie , action more frequent more varied than first movie . first movie final show down main character alien , outcome just uncertain . while each movie its charms its weaknesses , i am sure some prefer first over second , i still think second lot offer . note there bunch versions this movie . sure choose version best meets your needs budget . enjoy !	1

if you follow my reviews , you know i felt version " jack ripper " michael caine inspector fred abberline phenomenal masterpiece . not only michael caine phenomenal role , but version offered convincing speculation mystery we don't know never . while i respect this version johnny depp , it more horror oriented . ( michael caine version more historical . ) onto subject hand . some you may know jack 5 victims . ( mary anne nichols , annie chapman , elizabeth stride , kathy eadows , mary jane kelly . ) well , they seem close friendship , we also get impression they share some dangerous secret . ( michael caine version , 5 victims knew each other , but they just associates . ) well , course jack ripper comes into play . one scene very well while we don't see his face , we see some disturbing pictures , we see him cutting his steak pouring blood red wine . comes depp ( inspector fred abberline ) . it interesting while older michael caine brought frustration tremendous energy role , johnny depp looks like his character living borrowed time going die anyday . but maybe depp didn't want just imitate caine . one thing i problem while caine some trouble his superiors , depp trouble his superiors blown out proportion . ( without giving story away , his superiors must known things they didn't tell depp ! least caine superiors carried some reason their side ! ) you'll probably notice depp finds things out much quicker than caine . ( probably because caine version 4 hours , while depp only 2 . ) while caine involved artist , depp becomes involved mary jane kelly . gradually , depp discovers things put together interesting puzzle . like caine his version , depp ironically gets close almost friendly killer . ( course , depp not know he talking killer . ) well , problem here caine version , we understand more why killer appeared normal even friendly caine . we never really understand here why killer friendly even helpful depp . ( jack ripper not same mental illness he caine version . ) i admit scenery well , elements horror there , depp good job not just imitating michael caine . depp sergeant godley offer some entertainment . but if you saw michael caine version , you undoubtedly miss quite probable historical accuracy . if other hand , you don't mind fact this version more geared towards horror than history , you'll probably find it respectable horror movie . side note : johnny depp makes inspector fred abberline look like he going die anyday . well , reality , fred abberline lived 40 more years after he stopped jack ripper .	1
i could ( ) watched this movie over over again . it great	1
when i 10 years old , i saw this movie first time friend house when there sleepover . it scariest thing i ever seen . even since then , it my favorite horror movie or dare i say my favorite movie all time ? i think so . it classic . when i bought it dvd i expected bare bones edition nothing besides movie . i wrong . i shocked when i saw documentary including interviews john carpenter , debra hill , jamie lee curtis p.j. soles , among many others . i pleasantly surprised director commentary well . i usually don't watch films commentary because i find it ruins film , but ... i'm so fascinated this film i see . i highly recommened this film anyone , horror fan or not	1

this worst sequel i ever displeasure seeing . i knew it wasn't going good first one , but it this cheesy boring . they aged mia , got rid michael , threw her together some loser , made up some bogus law marriage . i really disappointed	-1
first one best thrillers ever , clever suspence , good characters , decent acting awesome effects . this one ... meh . why must you make sequel huge success hit turn franchise into straigh t-t o-video series ? what bloody point ? now there some good parts . rooms pretty nice musice score decent , but you know , doesn't even save it . this movie annoying , pointless downright piece crap only kids easily love . it so un-intelligent it really makes you wanna puke . characters nothing but cardboard cut-outs . i don't even know them well . all they scream , run around cube rooms cannot keep their mouths shut . i also really hate effects this one well . they felt like they over-used . there even scene where guy gets cut into peices look how badly it . direction ok , but when it comes adding wierdness , it too much . i don't understand story , there strange sex-scene which cube movie not need . cube suspence . this one just adding too much effects , four-dimensional cube trying make itself look better than first one . you don't need stuff . if you wanted make sequel better than first , add something original , don't take itself too seriously make sure it stays true original . but no , you just add all this unoiriginal time crap alot special effects taking over even sex scene which not cool because if it cube movie , you don't need nudity . overall , if you wanna kill off some time watching this crap , go ahead . i know you like watching people getting killed unoriginal ways watching sex scenes . if you're fan cube , dont ' bother . acting : 3/10ugh , don't get me started . these actors bad acting skills i hope they die . gore factor : 4/10cgi gore ?! come !? ta : 1/10a cube movie doesn't need nudity they don't know because they don't know cube . direction : 7/10andrzej sekula some visual eye some parts . i enjoy few scenes i dug rooms , but you know , i can't say he great director . he turned franchise straigh t-t o-video written all over it . bottom line : if you wanna watch , go ahead , then you'll sorry . this movie just sad . it doesn't try anything impress you because it idiotic . lets hope andrzej sekula learned his lesson should never sequel impressive indipendent film again	1

brad pitt angelina jolie star this action-packed thriller rather unorthodox married couple who very unique occupations . pitt jolie star john jane smith . both attending marriage counseling work out problems their marriage . jane works computers , while john works architect his friend eddie ( vince vaughn ) . they dinner each night 7 pm , neither much say . they live nice neighborhood friendly neighbors . but reality , there much more than meets eye . unbeknownst each other , both cooly lethal , highly-paid assassins working rival organizations . they both assigned same target , benjamin danz ( adam brody ) . both john jane show up intercept point , but reality , benjamin used bait draw out both john jane . organizations found out two married , there orders kill both them . jane soon discovers john one who foiled her attempt get benjamin , now she set her sights taking out her husband . what happens now battle among husband wife see who survive . john manage escape his wife ? they both realize they used bait much larger inter-organizational battle ? john jane join forces save each other ? i thought this very good movie . story very well-conceived . there lots action scenes , guns , knives , explosives , narrow escapes . there even elevator crashes ground top building . brad pitt angelina jolie perfect together , film keep you your toes throughout . i highly recommend this action-packed movie . this movie gives new meaning " till death us part " .	1

first , i give this 5 stars because subject matter subject matter importance , supplemental interviews dvd extras ; but not quality documentary filmmaking . more moment ... subject matter very , very , deadly serious . easily most important subject matter this decade certainly one top issues last 40 years . regardless whether you consider yourself one political camp or , or neutral ; you should know documentary looks both individual , very personal concerns such mother who lost her son war , also examines much broader , political economic aspects questions deserve attention , intelligent , calm discussion . **** even if you seen film disagree , you should watch dvd supplemental footage . if you miss these additional parts , you missing 50% information . please see #2 belowand if you critical main documentary viewpoint , you may welcome fact supplemental material largely unedited , running footage devoid any particular viewpoint film authors . this documentary well deserves praise one first approach this subject time when virtually entire western world media would not ( or could not ) go near this topic . when national fever high any questioning war effort considered " treason , " " unpatriotic , " " morally wrong ; " our constitutional rights such free speech free assembly serious danger . documentary portrays this , but ( unfortunately ) only sidelight fashion ( one many problems ) . fact , i'm not sure filmmakers realized this one greatest overriding issues . if common citizens better informed , insane actions atrocities would never happened . yet , documentary displays this serious , national problem absentee press graphically without any possible misinterpretation . both within us other parts world , censorship denial taking place . but it doesn't make points strongly or clearly enough . because this film its issues seen now tens millions , it part our culture effect growing . dismiss it without seeing it its entirety ( plus supplemental materials ! ) going cast doubt anyone who tries discuss documentary but doesn't know firsthand how information presented . basically , you can't attack documentary ideas unless you watch documentary . hearing it your uncle or coworker not acceptable working knowledge . furthermore , since these gigantic political life-threatening issues , every citizen duty informed possible . we can't country goes war , invades 2 other countries , kills permanently maims tens thousands its own soldiers tens thousands citizens other countries , puts 20,000 + jail six+ years , commits acts torture thousands , then substantial part its own population refuse consider this right or wrong , refuses spend 2 hours their time watching easily available documentary might shed new light or viewpoints this situation . said , michael moore his filmmaking team documentary skills decisions sometimes good , but other times quite poor . this documentary several problems , these nothing facts correct or other content issues ; this strictly documentary filmmaking * process * decisions made creation this work . -- big problem #1 : if you film titled " fahrenheit 9/11 " , don't start film discussing presidential election questions and/or irregularities . any filmmaker knows every minute , every second , their footage precious , especially first 10 minutes . documentary our nationwide election problems just fine . but that documentary ; maybe really good one , but i don't think it should included , except perhaps end . starting off material not directly related 9/11 attacks , mr. moore given his critics ample fodder criticism rejection beginning , even if reason rejection flaws . this decision huge presentation blunder , stole precious resources could used set up structure rest material , prepare audience what ahead . its final form , this information irrelevant next 90 minutes barely remembered after it all over . -- big problem #2 : mentioned above , filmmakers not appear good grasp subjects they documenting , there no strong sense what important what not . results missed opportunities , barrage information , lack clarity . information not well organized , it not summarized or reviewed times when new viewer needs time catch their breath . this problem editing pacing ; understanding how viewer or audience mentally keep track everything . doesn't mean material incorrect or faulty , it means it assembled presented poorly . comparison , i'd say it like reading book starting last chapter , then backing up one chapter time . sure , you read book all words , but people , information , story , connections going lot harder put together kind approach . we see lot really important information . there no doubt . but what most important points ? you might name 3 , but someone else might name 3 completely different ones . both would right ! however , this shouldn't happen if documentary well made . -- big problem #3 : film doesn't possess good structure . it not particularly linear piece , neither it follow several simultaneous information or storylines . it doesn't " scientific " approach or any other good format . instead it assembly line data but fails add up finished product , following this analogy , some information falls off assembly line easily forgotten . again , this doesn't mean data wrong , this mistake filmmaking ; all fairness , it sort mistake one would expect someone not well skilled creating documentaries . it not amateur , but it not tight coherent either . material both dense emotionally explosive , hard digest , especially if you aren't familiar all facts . but presentation doesn't work help viewer through this , connect many pieces information or give time pause review . instead , presentation relentless zigzag structure which takes away power material rather than combine it something stronger . instance , we see critically important censorship denial part media , but it not brought into sharp mental focus amongst all other information data , neither implications this media black hole . this needed stronger , more focused presentation . great crime war " freedom " denied " freedom press " very likely lost many viewers . add this seemingly never-ending series musical jokes segments , which i can't even guess their purpose . here we watching this [ literally ] deadly serious material , suddenly we silly rock music images , like some low-grade music video . this type decision truly amateur pathetic ; just shameful people joked . if documentary filmmakers don't treat subject seriousness , how they ridicule other people ? but this documentary shouldn't jokes . fact , no " true documentary " would ever take this lunatic approach , this behavior easily opens up entire subject ridicule . it incomprehensible how any documentary would created this type approach . shame producers , distributors , anyone else involved production not stepping forward " telling emperor he no clothes . " this juvenile , dimwit approach disgraces production insults everyone who suffered craziness " fahrenheit 9/11 " . this should never happened . -- big problem #4 : every moment film should runaway crazy " fahrenheit 9/11 , " but it isn't . example , president bush bangs podium exclaims usual nonsense terrorists hating freedom hating american goodwill . so why not show real reasons ? like fact united states sold arms iran iraq they fought each other years ago , creating immense hostility throughout middle east towards us ? little information , either remind or inform viewer real reasons hatred goes long way proving how we received endless stream lies misleading information entire situation . better yet , since you doing documentary , why not ask variety experts subject , them explain agree or disagree " terrorists hate america freedom " . instead , precious moments documentary stolen largely dead or irrelevant material , such when michael moore stands outside saudi embassy secret service coming ask questions . it interesting , but belongs supplemental materials section . not something qualifies national hysteria or " fahrenheit 9/11 " . it opens both michael moore his entire team criticisms grandstanding trying performers part story instead good documentary filmmakers . here one most important things you should know : original film documentary , we see us military raid civilian home suspected harbor terrorists my utter dismay , we see supplemental materials this part much larger story 10 times much impact , disgusting , barbaric outrageous disrespect ordinary citizens our soldiers . unfortunately this lost jumbled original cut . swedish reporter us military unit tells us no one , including swedish media , would present this shocking horrifying behavior . furthermore , only supplemental material lets us idea type documentary footage michael moore his team work . this well-documented sequence swedish journalists , we see one our military units invade ordinary family home our soldiers physically mentally abusing terrorizing ordinary citizens , including tormenting crippled old man . apparently they didn't understand its importance . then ! ... we find out one soldiers drunk , soldiers hit old man penis repeatedly , this all happens commanding officer watching calmly side . why earth wasn't this included main documentary ? this isn't bad abu ghraib torture sessions , but it dynamite material nevertheless . then we told this not anything unusual ; fact it commonplace ! showing our military behaving like this extremely important footage , shows why people iraq middle eastern world learned hate united states more more each year . yet , this crucial segment poorly presented largely lost original documentary . compared some segments mentioned above , this clearly more important . but , it cast aside . i cannot understand this . it hard speculate , but if this left out , we ask ourselves what other material discarded ? this , unfortunately , just plain bad decision-making documentary process , real lack comprehension part documentary filmmakers ; poor workmanship compared other documentary work . -- final thoughts : this point you may think my opinion documentary poor maybe not worth viewing , so let me avoid film mistake summarize this : this exceedingly serious important documentary , i recommend it supplemental materials anyone who considers himself good american , moral conscience , or anyone who interest american politics actions . you don't agree but you should familiar material see all i t.t hat why it gets 5 stars . you need watch this . however , i'm very critical documentary skill , or lack thereof , much better threfore less controversial documentary could created same materials , might more positive impact received wider acceptance . even so , this needs seen . if you confused how i give five stars something this many problems , let me repeat just delving into this subject national , political environment time its release breakthrough revolutionary . it would " great " hands others	1
so , i saw this movie once ... it guy it ... guy who always grey hair ... it julia roberts . first off ... i want make two things very very clear . if not one specific scene ... i would given this movie one star . so , anyway , it movie this guy who falls love this girl , because she really really beautiful self confident , but then he finds out she married this really big fat guy too ... who way way older than her , way richer than he . so then he all broken-hearted .... so then he sort goes through this flower period , where he realizes he wrong he needs sort ... re-birth . he ... he becomes this really amazing sensative guy , travels all over globe search meaning world peace . then , while he feeding starving children africa , he meets girl some swanky hotel where he giving one his peacful speeches . she sees man who he turned into ... so different skinny little boy next door who threw snow balls her way school . least , that what i feel happened inside him . because when he sees her again he feels like different person since last time he met her . he didn't really go africa all , but that what movie trying say ... his heart , become better person her ... he went africa.it really really touching	1

i bought this ( yep , you guessed it ) grocery store , which very clever marketing concept martha part . there only one dvd left . it contained classic recipes chicken , beef , fish , vegetarian other main dishes . if you think you already know how make classic , everyday dishes such meatloaf , think again - because martha variations may put whole new twist your usual standards . her use fresh herbs truly make difference glaze her meatloaf one i hadn't tried before . my family loved it . there also section bloopers ( yes , martha mistakes or mishaps while filming scene - slips , falls , etc ) . there 12 different cupcake variations extra section kitchen tips ( i learned plenty new things this section ) . i admit i looked bloopers section first , intrigued idea actually seeing martha make mistakes .. i only wish there more those . they funny , especially one showing martha pulling x-rated carrot her garden . you'll buy dvd see rest . it very short section , however . then i watched dvd start finish marveled quality production , well how much information packed into this dvd . start finish , each recipe demonstrated clearly . i intend use this one my youngest child because it perfect introduction some classic recipes , roast chicken meatloaf . they may not made way you used making them but one case advantage ... meatloaf recipe far better than my standard version glaze delicious ( aware your oven peculiarities , however , cover top keep glaze burning ; uncover just long enough brown ) . it would best , course , use oven thermometer know your oven actual temperature since 350 one oven may not 350 - those dials may inaccurate . but don't make mistake thinking this only beginning cooks ( although it'd perfect housewarming gift college graduate who just setting up house ) . there plenty new recipes , especially squash casserole which i am dying try my vegetarian friends , after tested it my family getting rave reviews . fact , one nicest sections this dvd vegetarian one . each those recipes looked delicious . martha mother featured some segments pleasant surprise . she martha chat they cook whole atmosphere nice casual . no matter what you may think martha stewart , this dvd top-notch , quality production tons useful info . dvd also inserted computer get list menus other features .	1

this film made brigitte bardot legend . i admit : i tried look this film objectively i find it alternately demeaning , silly , just plain dumb . so how come i'm giving it five stars ? one word : bardot . if you assemble dictionary would use visuals illustrate various words , bardot mambo sequence would authoritatively define word " sensual . " pulsating sound bongos background punctuated blaring horns , brigitte larger than life dancing room room like woman possessed . this may not acting but it sure holds your attention - kind like watching human transform into wild animal . this sequence tells you all you need know why bardot legend even her senior years . no , i don't believe god created woman silly ending which we expected believe few slaps jean louis trintignant enough turn bardot into submissive french housewife . other hand , i don't think audiences 1950 ready deal reality sexually liberated woman like brigitte .	1

ok , get things straight , only reason i ever bought this movies joseph mazzello name front . this actor , always , gives stunning performance , reason u should view this movie . mary elizabeth mastrantonio gives good performance also struggling single mother . script starts really nice promising , some intelligent thoughts combined funny moments , however , time it ends you start wondering what point . end , my opinion ( although maybe i'm way too cynical therefore subjective ) not satisfactory . it clearly addresses child you , it just it address 4 years old child . this after all family movie , one watch your kids nice cozy living room afternoon when there nothing else better . problem i'm not sure kids would really wanna go through first half film ( although u ) time it reaches end , addressing child supposed watch it , u suddenly feel dumb even sticking whole story . however , if u disregard end imagine tom meeting old jack , this movie could quite enjoyable . other problem patrick swayze . now , i haven't seen other movies he starred , but here ... makes me wonder whether he good actor . maybe he just wasn't part , because i can't sence chemistry him ms. mastrantonio , let alone joseph mazzello ( which chemistry film supposed rely upon ) . he just doesn't fit part . but again , if you disregard this also , you draw something out this film . i said it worth buying just this your joseph mazzello collection , because ending scene , 12 years old tom riding bicycle where main character departs , heart-breaking . how 12 year old child ( supposing he 12 then because it looks like ) pull off beyond me . i think we expect great things him . kid plays his brother overall cute , which exactly what he supposed throughout film - make u feel sympathetic towards him , so no objection there . third problem score . quite frankly , stupidest music i've ever heard . so i said if you're fan mr. mazzello get this movie , if not , well then what u waiting , but start something different like cure or simon birch . if you fan mr. swayze ... i ask why ?	1

let it written , this how television ought made . scripted , staged acted apex success sophistication , i never my life lucky enough see anything like quality elizabeth , bbc very fine 1970s miniseries chronicling more well-known aspects life queen elizabeth 1 . set across series six two-hour plays , story follows young protestant princess elizabeth , disowned shut away while her catholic sister mary takes throne . her subsquent release coronation set stage more eventful , treacherous successful aspects rest her reign - her failed romances , her successful campaigns , her would-be asassinations shot down - each captured so beautifully acted so convincingly completely enthrall viewer . glenda jackson magnificent , it rare thing indeed any actress able portray such age range ( sixteen or so well over sixty ) , , excellent makeup effects notwithstanding , it such consistency timing . jackson palpable skill total immersion such expansive archaic role superlative , sets stage series other quite brilliant performances names like vivian pickles mary scotland , stephen murray bloody-minded chauvanistic cardinal walsingham excellent daphne slater ill-fated queen mary 1 . such performances hand , bbc could forgiven staging productions shoestring budget , but happily this not case , historical detail abounds richness costumes , sparseness elizabethan sets overall sense moment history not forgotten modern researchers . where cate blanchett ' elizabeth ' ( excelletn film , too , but simply not this league ! ) flashy lush , contrasting sense lush spartan treatments some visuals ' elizabeth ' creates such sense period it easy forget this simply tv series . but that doing it injustice .

i've actually hoping live cd release , but i more than happy this dvd . all favorites here ( only minor gripe omission echo 11am , inclusion priceless , but that just personal preference ) . this all evidence needed show this band reached maturity . drive unexpected change , but most played-out song their lineup , obscurity welcome . musical talent all around seems much improved previous dvds , each member gets show off all their new tricks . unlike some other bands , incubus seems perfectly display each musician talents so well each song , this -for me- showed how it all put together so seamlessly . every song highlight this one - my favorites made tv movie sick sad little world . other notes : it perfect place film dvd ; we get see brandon play guitar how well ben works backup singer ; i think jose could make any rock band sound good . recommended any fan incubus , especially their newer material	1

this very entertaining movie great car chase , gun fight , explosion , face off scenes acceptably suspenseful storyline . good acting cruise hoffman , i must say . however , you feel something missing . scenes memorable those i ii rare , if any . style j.j. abrams much weaker than those his predecessors . fact , he didnt leverage score all . short , disregarding mi label , it still outstanding action thriller . recommended	1

i recently found this two-pack bargain bin five bucks , lucy fan i snatched it up brought it home . well all i say i'm glad i only paid five bucks it . up side shows highly entertaining they highlight era television rarely receives it due , but down side tranfer looks like it pooped times all you see white screen outline lucy . but shows almost make this dvd good value , bottom line ! buy it five bucks . any higher it bad value	1
during my teenage years i fan wwf wrestling specifically , rock . he tremendous wrestler who fans admired right away because his talent extremely funny microphone cut some funniest , most disgusting lines ever mentioned wwf tv . his talent ring spot-on , rock would always give people everything he when it came time step ring compete . he rarely made mistake ring ... but he made huge mistake stepping away wrestling walking down path hollywood . it not doom really bad movie . sure , it movie considered disappointment right get go because no one wanted watch it movie theaters . it just normal , monster-shooting film delivers tiny amount suspense , that it . i'm sure movie would've big it released 10 years ago . todays generation probably sick go-nowhere do-nothing action films such doom . okay , so it go somewhere , but film isn't really designed build awe-inspiring creative story . doom kind movie you don't really want seek out- you just happen come across it video store decide you need quick 90-minute action fix , so you rent movie , watch it , then forget it next morning . course , i'm sure you don't forget rewind tape because that impolite . rock never should left wrestling . it bad career move millions wrestling fans ( rock means millions ) really miss him . come back home , rock . please	1

we bought this installment " disney treasures " series when it released late 2005 . my 9 year old son i just watched these cartoons again ( oct . 2006 ) we both love them . i would agree , however , those reviewers who noted visually cartoons this vol . 2 " chronological donald " not restored same degree perfection those earlier releases , including vol . 1 " chronological donald " release containing many donald world war ii cartoons entitled " front lines " . there clear difference quality , which apparent when donald cartoons previously released " front lines " repeated this collection compared cartoons new here . former visually superior , not because they better begin , but because they more carefully restored transferred . this shame . one hopes chronological donald vol 3 ( apparently not released 2006 , but perhaps 2007 ) there return quality vol . 1 " front lines .

i havent gotten really , really good angry movie long time , course , it took film like troy remind me what it like . let me start saying if your idea good time brad pitt orlando bloom slightly misted sweat looking pretty , then turn sound down , grab bowl popcorn all means , enjoy this movie beautiful costuming , ignore rest this review . but , if you expect even one iota more out movie ..... dont waste your time .... i'm saddened fact i cant get 2 hours 40 some odd minutes my life i wasted here back . dialogue insipid ( they actually left line , " i'm sorry sir .... your wife left trojans . " film .... ) , everyone speaks british accent , except brad pitt .... which wouldn't bad if he wasnt star film . then there extras who play sailors .... who reasons i cant quite understand seem speaking greek .... when rest greeks speaking english british accent .... well ... except brad pitt . one scene , achilles ( pitt ) his cousin (?) sparr swords among majestic greek ruins next beautiful blue sea .... i actually hit pause scream screen , " idiots !!! it would building then ! not ruins ! " . real trojan war lasted over ten years .... this filmed version appears last two weeks ... days break here there allow main characters look suitably attractive beach ... you very little if any idea loss life each side .... short , this movie pure unadulterated drivel . youre asked care what began war ( you don't ) , you're asked believe brad pitt achilles smoldering brooding ( you can't ) , youre expected come away knowledge thousands years this considered greatest war all time ( you won't ) . however much spent making this film wasted .	-1
when i first saw this little film , it aired comedy central none fanfare it should received since it initial release . fact , office space reached cult status reason . it funny , witty , always makes you laugh . cast includes jennifer aniston supporting role waitress/girlfriend ron livingston character who epiphany during group therapy session . alex wentworth plays his girlfriend her shorter role . anyway , i don't remember man who plays arab employee friend ron character but he should applauded his role . newsradio stephen root should his own sitcom his performance milton , poor picked employee who reaches breaking point film . diedrich bader plays neighbor next door who offers wisdom ron character film . mad tv alum gregory herman plays colleague computer geek . mad tv alum orlando jones plays guy selling magazines door door . he turns out not person you think he . gary cole memorable performance boss who thinks he knows it all but doesn't know anything . movies like office space make me understand what we become those us office . imagine , if we just didn't work anymore . would heaven me	1
i'm those who saw this sundance , all things i enjoy gaiman mckean graphic novels display : quiet humor , intelligence , delightful weirdness , astounding visual vocabulary . except this case , words spoken good actors , all those visuals get up off their feet move . it hard describe impact watching mckean painting move talk . there might those who quibble movie looking too " animated , " but course that exactly point : create world make it dance . end result , visually least , like nothing you've ever seen before , absolutely worth seeing reason alone . some people i talked after screening also loved visuals but felt story bit dull , they seen it all before . well , it true story wear its influences its sleeve -- little " alice wonderland " here , little " time bandits " there , lot " wizard oz " over here , not mention resemblance gaiman own " coraline . " but i'm just familiar those stories anyone else , resemblances never interrupted my enjoyment " mirrorrmask " -- after all , it what you story determines its success . moment moment , there enough innovation cleverness , enough delight wonder , make movie positive delight . when movie came out theaters i went see it again , there little girl six years old row ahead me who sat through whole thing eyes agog ; then friend mine tried show dvd her young son but he got completely creeped out spider-thingie . ( hey , " wizard oz " moment when witch appears crystal ball exactly same effect me -- yet it lingered memory , when i got older i drawn back fell love movie . that how this stuff works . ) " mirrormask " probably little too wild full-out commercial success ; but i bet it going long , long shelf life dvd people pull it out tell their friends " wait till you see this .	1

this kurosawa fist use widescreen , it looks glorious . while he managed simulate wider shots his past films academy aspect ratio , this , rife innumerable extras epic landscape , just awesome spectacle . like all good kurosawa though , story simple , elemental , yet definitive . two peasants/thieves absolute riot , mifune comes across amazing presence ... fantastically usual . criterion film justice excellent transfer , but little way supplementary material , especially when compared recent releases -- introduction george lucas this disk great though . price this disk , lack audio commentary , etc ... unfortunate . truly character driven story , film boasts people crass , yet lovable . not concerned apocalypse like kurosawa some previous later works , hidden fortress offers rousing adventure , which encapsulates classic story telling its stylistic best . such , this one favorites my personal kurosawa collection .	1
i saw last half hour this movie bravo network last week when i actually looking rerun " project runway , " so my first exposure it segment k-mart interview charlton heston . wow . i ended up grateful " project runway " wasn't . i made sure catch " bowling columbine " when bravo ran it again , so i could see whole thing . they showed it again last night . i say here , prior this , i'd never seen anything michael moore ( except one episode " tv nation " ) never interest seeing any his films because all negative things i'd heard , including things moore fans raved i thought negative , such way moore confronts people his films . what surprised me " bowling columbine " what came across me michael moore compassion . i really got sense he cared very deeply people who lost their lives through gun violence well people who lived unfortunate circumstances . i much greater respect him than i before i saw film . his motivating factor doesn't seem me so much political moral . he truly moralist . he reminds me abolitionists nineteenth century way . ( who awful lot people found annoying , if i need remind anyone . ) him , i don't think it so much " corporations other powerful entities evil " " people not caring other people -- especially people not caring those who less fortunate -- results separation hostility people , which leads evil . " well , shoot , they preach my church every sunday . , last time i checked , we weren't socialists . also : i heard , even moore fans , his interview charlton heston unfortunate embarrasing . but i don't agree . why shouldn't he asked heston why he what he ? why earth would heston gone denver flint after what happened ? i just don't understand it . some people said heston obviously suffering alzheimer incapable carrying interview . he seemed entirely lucid me . he lucid enough get up walk away because he didn't want answer questions . thank you , michael moore , leaving kayla rolland photo behind . maybe charlton heston took it inside . maybe it made some kind difference . peac	1

2 fast 2 furious one those sequels comes around every so often doesn't require you seen original . i saw this movie first time not too long after it came out , never seen original , i thought i would lost wouldn't enjoy myself much other people , but contrary - i left experience much happier than when i came . this film full quick one-liners deserve laugh . special effects car races leave your mouth gaping open . i heard read people didn't appreciate this film much because it seemed focus more plot than first film rather than focus more races , but overall , i think balance works well . even thinking plot we left , i really can't see time when race would even appropriate . people saying this film worse than original , i would disagree ... why ? frankly , i always firm believer than vin diesel entirely overrated actor . ( i mean , c'mon - you seen pacifier ? ) he nothing more than meat head who , while able pretty good fight scenes , should leave dialogue someone else . yes , this film younger crowd , there numerous occasions when unbelievable events take place ( take boat jumping example ) , but there no saying older person wouldn't enjoy it well ... only thing i say you really shouldn't go into this film expecting oscar worthy performance , or else you disappointed . if you sit back take this fun romp it , however , you thoroughly enjoy yourself	1

very nice dvd , only problem cost ( too much taxes paid italy ) ..	1
there not lot you need know thank you smoking , except it gleefully jaundiced , well-nigh perfectly paced adaptation christopher buckley novel . teacher who used lead class critical thinking , i took particular pleasure witty " spins " glib lobbyist nick naylor treats us he advocates big tobacco . sidelight : not one person this film actually smokes cigarette . special shout-outs excellent supporting actors david koechner ( gun advocate bobby jay bliss ) j.k. simmons ( budd " b.r. " rohrabacher ) . oh , rob lowe actually darned funny his role . i guess he act after all	1
i saw this long time ago showcase channel , heard it through local tv-guide-ish magazine . man , i blown away quality beauty this film . it man who one day claims he son god he bringing second coming . first nobody believes him , but then he starts performing miracles , people start realising this might real deal . i won't ruin ending ( it your job watch it ! ;) ) but part gets me every time . it true piece work , film deserves much more loving . it definitely worth your time	1
this one my favorite movies recent years . it gives funny realistic portrayal high school life need fit , well world high school cliques . movie , lindsey lohan moves chicago after home schooled africa her scientist parents enters public school first time . she befriends two groups : pair outcasts clique cool girls . she then finds herself torn them she tries fit somewhere . this movie , above all , absolutely hilarious . see it if you get chance .	1
it good season worth owning . i assume you already know this if you reading this . dvd set presented good sound , picture quality etc ..... however .... i really disappointed see warner bros . cheaped out english subtitles this time around . seasons 2-4 awesome watch subtitles hard hearing , it really helped comprehension all medical jargon spewed out 100 miles hour . medical professional myself , i got lot out this " special " feature . my fiancee , who not medical professional , found she able get lot more out show watching subtitles well . it definitely helps viewer appreciate complexity show writing . show still great . however , it inexplicable why we wait 7 months this dvd set come out when they obviously didn't put much work into it previous sets ( ie . they didn't want pay someone transcribe scripts sync subtitles ) . this especially irksome considering season 5 available dvd uk quite long while now . i just assumed warner bros . spending extra time cash job right north america . i wrong	1
i leave it others , better it than i am , detail story , actors , hollywood behind this wonderful film . what i need you understand film central theme , life handed us society , life we programmed into accepting unquestioningly unreflectingly one big fraud , more relevant today than ever . this film , more than any other , dares ask right question shows us one man search one right answer . it search tyrone power character begins himself , concludes world filled friends who live falsely rather than truly , chosen illusion happiness over truth possibility despair . take journey him ... you won't disappointed . life tirelessly struggling wealth , power , fame , pleasure cannot help us achieve real happiness , even though rule over us name order organization , structures society must their best convince us it . answer question , why we behave we , live we , got more than what we told almost moment birth ... why not . this film says , living good life , happy life means walking edge , walking tightrope illusion truth . we never hope get all way across , but , like any real-life tightrope , stop means perish .	1

amy sedaris , paul dinello , stephen colbert gregory hollimon all shine " strangers candy , " sublime spoof those abc " after school specials " we grew up late 1970s early 80s . " strangers candy " based upon unlikely premise 46 year-old ex junkie whore jerri blank turning around her life returning high school freshman after 32 years wild side . each week brings some new " crisis , " which involves fitting vs . conforming , trying drugs alcohol , teenage sexual experimentation , retardation special ed , etc . naturally , half-wit jerri always makes wrong choice . " strangers candy " comedy central most clever politically incorrect show ( even moreso than " south park " ) . jerri her alcoholic stepmother ( prudishly played deborah rush ) , classmate indeterminate ethnicity ( " orlando , " played orlando pabotoy ) who jerri uses butt her racist jokes , amazingly narcissistic faculty , headed principal onyx blackman ( greg hollimon ) , black principal penchant " fine white women .

personally , i don't think i would resort murder , but four brothers this movie there no doubt how far they would go . set off police force lack effort ( their eyes ) finding their adoptive mother killer , four brothers take vigilante justice whole new level . nearly lost plot killing , corruption revenge though story family , loyalty love , even respect ( woman who raised them mostly ) . i touched their thanksgiving meal where they each saw her , except bobby , who finally saw her end . josh charles plays smarmy , dirty cop ( like he swat ) garrett hedlund amazing job troubled , youngest brother who tries so hard make older ones proud . well piece singleton sure , it could set any large city but he picked detroit . interesting . this movie very gritty violent , but i drawn right everytime i thought i it figured out there twist	1

kurosawa way ahead his time this one ( just he film depicting paparatcy 1950 , " scandal " ) . scenes movie amazingly similar today scenes street rappers us cities . they resemble not only street rhythm rap songs , but also movements , dress , attitude . he got street life right edo period 21st century well . you don't want miss this piece work genius	1
almost everything this movie bad . writing side , there no plot , no theme , no characterisation . it like first , very rough draft , everyone involved convinced themselves so brilliant it didn't need re-working . it impossible tell , example , if father meant brilliant but fading , or just rather stupid impostor . he constantly makes references literary works he believes valid , he teaches creative writing , but none his comments any intrinsic value : it just what he personally likes or dislikes . so we're left wondering if we're supposed see him pathetic literary snob or guy who right . quite possibly , this confusion caused writer this film similar position . much this film like ' wonder boys ' without charm , humour , humanity , surprise interesting dialogue . it classic example how up its own arse so much artsy film-making . plot faults abound , e.g. others already pointed out absurdity entire audience not heard pink floyd song plagiarised son . morality making such young actor say stuff he shouldn't . . . . this country ( uk ) , we double-standards this sort thing , it looks like us may too . instance , here press slaughtered , continues so , gary glitter , pop star who found thousands pictures child porn his computer . rightly , his career ended overnight , press continued pursue him . contrast benjamin britten , classical composer . bb liked young , under-age , boys ; he wooed them , took them holidays him one case least , sexually abused victim point ruining his life . but his music still played , his reputation intact . fact , he recently book written him which writer ' explains ' his child-abusing not really all , because bb day it seen more companion/mentor kind thing . this film good example how double standards apply , both morally artistically , under banner ' art ' . but fact , it boring , witless , unrealistic , morally suspect , piece work whose only saving grace it short .	-1
george sluizer original dutch-french version vanishing ( aka man who wanted know ) offers one european cinema most quietly disturbingly anonymous everyday sociopaths , feeling his way one step time towards murder . if you've seen version , you probably still can't get final revelation out your head , but film plenty more offer than , playing chronology , subverting usual cliches its ' lady vanishes ' plot ( hero wants know what happened his missing lover far more than he wants her alive ) throwing some excellent characterization . i only assume this 1993 us remake sluizer so determined o-o ne else going get chance ruin his film when he perfectly capable doing it himself , but few people could anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work . his career never recovered . chief culprit astonishing performance jeff bridges overthought through every detail truly disastrous level . friend who produced one his earliest movies noted bridges great instinctive actor long you stopped him thinking what he doing , this film proof pudding . every movement overly mechanical its precision , making him look like rusty clockwork toy , while his voice bizarre mixture tootsie , latka gravas taxi dalek who all taking elocution lessons dok-tah e-ville . no banality evil here , just looney walking around invisible sign over his head saying " please . let . me . kill . you . thank you . your . consideration . ' but blame really needs shared out here . none performances good : often , they don't even look good - keifer sutherland looks more like baby hamster than distraught man his wits end hurried scenes gas station , nancy travis flounders badly sandra bullock makes no impression all object his obsession . not they're given any help either director or writer todd graff . script particularly weak . chronology altered put focus firmly bridges expense couple opening film . worse rush film , draining life character each scene its race get next . rather than high/low mood shifts couple relationship or apparently casual but careful establishing feel location , we just get couple arguments give you impression he probably better off without her . new improved happy ending - standard woman chased nutter woods jeopardy stuff complete lame `let end joke like tv cop show ' moment - best not go there ... which advice holds this entire trainwreck movie . even shockingly bland uninspired jerry goldsmith score can't anything this one .	-1
alan alda must feel blessed such integral part two greatest shows television history . creative forces behind west wing gathered their collective strengths gave series ending it deserved . decades now i'll pulling out these discs watching them . horror sadness we learned last december john spencer suddenly passed . west wing fans grieved sent their prayers behalf mr. spencer those who actually known loved him . we see some love respect gets translated show episodes swirl around leo death among most heart-breaking i've ever seen screen . when kristin chenoweth annabeth tells bradley whitford josh leo died her tears didn't look all like " acting " . same said expressions faces all actors leo funeral , ending martin sheen president bartle t.t he storyline this season centers presidential race jimmy smits portraying congressman matt santos against alda senator arnold vinick . this ticket clearly fantasy liberal writers even republican candidate pro-choice , insults some nra-type vigilantes all but thumbs his nose religious right . vinick campaign derailed somewhat aftermath nuclear accident california particularly shrewish right-winger brought help senator woo back republican base . ron silver continues his role bruno gianelli , political strategist who only cares winning - knows how it . patricia richardson effective vinick assistant who tries keep him track . janeane garofalo serves sparring partner josh lou , democratic operative who gets almost much pleasure seeing josh flounder ( which he inevitably brief moments ) helping her political causes . teri polo plays helen - candidate santos ' wife - this character always seems little less enthusiastic than would appropriate wife man who may become president . aside sensitive respectful way real-life death john spencer worked into fictional story , this season gets few other things right . where we may frustrated past lack love lives most these characters years - all service their country - this season we get see most principal characters hook up one way or . first daughter ellie gets married white house ceremony curiously missing both her sisters . ( although all three daughters make leo funeral . ) through their own obvious attraction donna persistence josh donna finally get together . opening first episode we're glad see flashback c.j. danny concannon married child , other episodes we get see danny gentle courting techniques one most powerful ( powerfully nice ) women world . it also gratifying see some " old friends " show up final episodes such rob lowe return sam seaborn . ( sam recruited duty josh scene pays homage earlier flashback scene season two when josh conscripts sam first " bartlet america " campaign . ) shows writers , directors , actors , professionals who shot , set costumed show : bravo ! i'll miss you dearly watch these shows enduring pleasure . pinheads who decided release these dvds without any significant extras : pox your houses . while first seasons came full sets subtitles , documentaries commentary tracks which performers , directors creators couldn't withhold their obvious glee - this season comes next nothing . first seasons came subtitles english , francais espanol . last two seasons not option english subtitles . what if viewer hard hearing ? what reason these deficiencies ? laziness ? complacency ? no doubt almighty dollar played major role . this show - this show fans - deserved better . rest well-deserved honored peace , john spencer . adieu , west wing .	1
this film beautifully portrays both tenacity human spirit dark brutality it descends like no other . compelling acting leading actress marina golbahari awesome any standard , so notable performances her on-screen friend played arif herati . this must-see anyone who wishes view tragedy oppressive taliban rule afghanisitan new , poignant human side ; all too often we become desensitised barrage carnage repeatedly shown mass media . this evocative film reawaken your sensitivities real human suffering taking place so many places world	1
i dont know what its like gone school 1980 or gone school united states but i still relate this movie . this movie could set anywhere any decade it would still tell same story , only fashion accessories would different . everyone seen this movie now everyone opinion it most say it really good movie . i would say it deserves called classic now . it may not laugh out loud comedy or very dramatic move little slow times , but it delivers its message loud clear keeps you engaged throughout whole movie . it gains momentum it moves end , after experiencing all emotiions you feel satisfied . small cast , all your attention focused individual characters . 5 students all completely different one all brilliant . each actor plays their part perfectly . while there large age gap them they all convincing teenagers fighting there own demons . they all probably most remembered this movie , exception emilio estevez , but special mention must go judd nelson who i believe biggest star film . his part originally intended either nicholas cage or john cusack who would also great , but i'm glad judd got his chance prove his acting capabilities . it shame dvd lacks many special features . all you get trailer cast bios , i desperately seeking audio commentary , or very least production notes , however there some interesting facts noted imdb . teen movie 80 generation , anyone born after film made probably not like it , but others who grew up around or just after it probably agree this movie indeed classic . 7.5 /1	1
viewing series 3 , i struck how well producers targeted all three series late 20th-century-middle-class-working-woman-viewer . house elliott all work problems : establishing career insufficient formal credentials , working man world , finding out who you trust business , working people you dislike who nonetheless valuable contributors business , supervising people who dislike each other , hit male coworkers business associates , juggling your demanding career often conflicting demands husband or boyfriend , juggling motherhood work , dealing creatively work emergencies . series 3 , lower-class working conditions , socialism potential solution , major new themes . there also more emphasis demands motherhood ( bea tilly babies ) previously minor characters , especially home lives house elliott employees . pace frenetic compared first two series , lots multiple plot lines quick shifts back forth them , unnecessarily dramatic camera angles , dropped situations , overall too much going . all characters make major life some cases personality shifts . tilly becomes clinically depressed . bea new boyfriend daniel rapidly evolves arrogant , callous , resentful , self-centered , exploitative jerk ( he even gigolo ) sensitive , caring guy who makes major sacrifices evie . evie rejected boyfriend miles apparently turns sweet , caring , sensitive , generous guy shark trying take over house elliott . this really science fiction series where their brains got swapped night ? every single one plots ends up cliffhanger . tilly norm become employed again ? agnes leave house elliott become full-time music hall singer ? jack succeed his new career socialist politician , bea able cope politician wife ? donald happy all sacrifices he made bea ? miles end up running house elliott ? many more . . . but most all , new rift bea evie ( who throughout this show always closer each other than any husband or boyfriend ) ever heal ? stay tuned series 4 : except , far i tell , there wasn't one . nonetheless , fans series 1 2 certainly want watch series 3 . oh , clothes great	1

i love john grisham books , though i've not read rainmaker , i thoroughly enjoy this movie . it david goliath story underprivileged family greener than grass lawyer taking mega-insurance company . ( believe it or not , i work insurance company ! ) storyline great .... matt damon danny devito compliment each other well this film . subplot rudy love interest bit more than movie really needs ... i'd interested see if portion exists or how it plays out book . overall though , if you're looking nice solid movie , i'd recommend this one	1
you tell header , i disappointed this movie . since kurt russell plays lead , i should not surprised , because parts he plays generally rather predictable simplistic ( tango cash , snake plisskin , etc ) . i just don't picture kurt lead actor gritty , realistic drama ... but , eternally optimist , i hoped this might exception . it wasn't . story involves two la detectives , one grizzled thoroughly corrupt veteran ( russell ) other somewhat principled but weak-willed easily manipulated rookie , bobby keough ( scott speedman ) . russell character ( eldon perry ) controlled protected exceedingly corrupt superior officer , jack van meter ( nicely played brendan gleeson ) , who uses perry further his profitable flagrantly illegal interests . if you ever watched " shield " fx cable network then you familiar this general setup .... morally ambiguous detective used further his superior agenda ..... but here problem : shield ( television series ) vastly superior every way : plot , acting , characterization , dialog , direction , etc . this feature film . it like comparing filet mignon cheap hamburger . once you see quality , nuanced drama like shield , this movie all like it rendered unwatchable . characters dark blue caricatures almost no depth . they guzzle whiskey laugh their flagrant crimes . plot dialog contrived unrealistic . there no subtlety .... no intellectually stimulating complexity . eldon always exactly he told : if mass-murdering thugs ( employed protected his superior ) sheltered arrest , simply go out murder couple stray ex-cons let them take rap ( posthumously ) real criminals . never mind neither ex-cons even close plausible suspect . no one would fooled this ruse , except perhaps this mindless movie . eldon gets his partner keough perform one cold-blooded murders ordered van meter , thus begins their downfall , because keough spontaneous change heart suddenly cannot accept guilt his actions . one minute he guzzling whiskey his cronies laughing lying shooting review board , next he overwrought guilt . not all likely real life , but it suits plot . things gets even sillier when partner ( speedman ) then teams up assistant chief ( ving rhames ) predictably beautiful ex-mistress ( michael michelle ) try arrest real thugs use them bring down whole perverted mess . heaven forbid he simply come forth provide evidence accomplish this end . what follows lengthy , confused , poorly choreographed pursuit thugs predictable gun battle equally predictable outcome . ultimate farce , however , reserved eldon himself , who drives around south central los angeles during peak rodney king riots trying find arrest black suspect .... which he easily accomplishes .... then drives away without scratch . this reaches level surrealistic absurdity insult true horror riots . equally unconvincing eldon spontaneous change heart end movie , during his promotion ceremony ( such irony ) , when he delivers rambling , preposterous unconvincing indictment his father , himself , his evil superior .... which simplistically immediately accepted ( true movie fashion ) all who hear it , who then immediately jump arrest condemn naughty superior . this silly , implausible , insult any viewer above age ( maturity ) 10-year old . jump up your next promotion ceremony deliver rambling condemnation your superior see what happens . this type naive nonsense occurs only one place : movies .... bad ones . if you thrilled tango cash , thought snake plissken brilliantly-portrayed anti-hero , then all means hit " buy it now " button this dvd . but , if you want complexity , subtlety , realism , plausibility , infinitely superior acting , plot , characterization , direction .... yourself huge favor use your money either subscribe fx cable , or buy/rent dvd shield series .... filet mignon always better than cheap hamburger	1
some might suggest there now three things not discuss polite conversation : 1 ) politics 2 ) religion 3 ) viet nam . viet nam , battle would become known hamburger hill resulted over ninety per cent one american platoon dead . yet body count would still necessary see which side suffered greater losses . directing mass charges via waves infantry modern warfare initially chronicled during korean conflict only later officially recognized ' war ' . importantly , hamburger hill also battle before it made into movie also war named but never declared . overview , modern war , film-making or army life , " we soldiers " merits full consideration . mel gibson turns flawless performance walking point this sortie became first major battle viet nam conflict , later unofficially entitled " war . " one loses count important issues exposed this courageous work . many would ask , " so who cares ? " would garner first score gibson . author hal moore , whose " we soldiers once , young " basis this film , certainly deserves first bow initiating this work , though he might return horse laugh use ' bow .

when body heat came out 1981 , i living las vegas time bus system city didn't run out theater showing it . i walk four miles this movie , it certainly worth it . particular scene i wanted see film , however , cut out . disappointment , but rest film more than made up it . scene now included " deleted " scene new edition this dvd , one kathleen turner dressed up stewardess nylons underneath her skirt playing around william hurt couch . i've waited twenty-five long years see this scene , it , too , worth it . there over hour worth extras this dvd , if you're big fan film i am , you'll want see them . kathleen turner sexy ever , i still crush her . voice hers still melts me after all these years !	1

all many many documentaries recounting despicable acts mass murder committed name allah day , this far most comprehensive most unflinching . because this , those whose mindsets side more terrorists find this factual documentary somewhat distressing its raw recitation events . perhaps none more so than " caesar " his review sept . 17 , 2006 . if only he found least troubling carnage , bloodshed , destruction deliberately perpetrated his islamic buddies against civilian populations . but , more this bit . regards this extraordinary video , perspectives air traffic controllers , faa officials , norad neads , air crews passengers board each four doomed flights , testimonies witnesses , participants , firefighters , all heroes near ground zero , this singular documentary takes you minute minute through hell deliberately planned perpetrated those whose religion them believing execution such hellish bloodshed granted them virgin-laden heaven . ( no ... this not " propaganda " or view documentary , but instead my own conclusions drawn many years personal investigation islam ) . anyone who , like " caesar " here , could watch this fully factual account then call such splendid documentary " goody-goody propaganda " " try(ing ) portray us good guys hit bad guys ... " reveals instead either their rabid religious fanaticism or otherwise their own anti-american hatred so apparently condoning such ghastly blood-soaked horrors acts " good guys " retaliating against " bad guys . " while " caesar " ( how telling nickname ) attempts school us ignorant americans our country past political-policy foibles , yet he fails mention billions financial economic aid we given islamic nations , millions military equipment technical advisory assistance provided them they struggled against invading soviet forces and/or other foreign enemies attempting annex rule over sovereign islamic nations , ousting kuwait brutal armed forces islamic fascist dictator who invaded then " enjoyed " weeks metaphoric all too literal raping this tiny islamic nation while openly looting , terrorizing , butchering , torturing , murdering its citizens while none its islamic neighbors lifted so much finger intervene , but instead begged united nations u.s. solve their problems them ... which we ! these just tiny listing far greater acts we cause justice good , all it islam behalf . yet , 9/11 only latest greatest terrorist massacre which we continue repaid bloodthirsty religion islam all we continue its behalf . " caesar " also glaringly omits all too conveniently ignores radical islam blood-soaked history their on-going policy religiously motivated bomb blasts , hijackings , kidnappings , tortures , rapes , gang rapes , female circumcisions , sawing and/or hacking off people limbs heads , mutilations , always ... mass murder after mass murder after yet more mass murder all perpetrated against civilian populations worldwide , including those their own religion , all thanks islam foundational tenets blood lust makes all such horrors not only acceptable but actually laudable , eternally rewardable , thus ... forever inevitable . true , all religions their radicals fanatics . but none deliberately attract , nurture , encourage terrorist fanatics more than islam . none preaches genocide against entire jewish race/nation all non-islamic " infidels " name god more than islam . it how this video accurately documents entire world only this latest greatest mass butchery name allah probably motivates " caesar " most attempt such blatant anti- u.s. propagandizing here . those who would disagree , i challenge " caesar " or anyone else provide us any reliable evidence even single factual error this documentary . what i think " caesar " fears most such powerful documentary this might add growing world view despite constant rhetoric islam religion " peace , " ever-escalating terrorist acts its leaders constituents name islamic religion reveal exact opposite true case . maybe it just me , but i'm thinking any religion so encourages its hormone-driven young men blow themselves up many " infidels " they so spend eternity orgiastic sex 72 virgins deserves fully prosecuted , very least charges " conspiracy commit ( mass ) murder " ! one thought just hit me : if more more islamics continue either commit or condone such bloodshed full approval their islamic leaders , which god they truly honoring emulating : allah -- creator life ; or instead , iblis ( satan ) , destroyer it ? their fruits they known , after all . question whom what islamics most worship adore , permit me close this review also this wonderful documentary , quoting one islam most renowned clerics : " we love death . u.s. loves life . big difference us .

not quite up par original , this long awaited second installment ( not same thing sequel ) hampered interruptions when celebrities came on-screen discuss works . not only this my opinion disrupt continuity visual accompaniments some human species ' most beautiful music , but fifty years people aren't going know who most those by-then long-dead women men , this supposed classic ages . i also think fantasia 2000 missing delight elements abstraction darkness first film . finally i wish it broken mold modern animation hand-drawn painted , instead making extensive use computers producers so clearly . now , what this film right it really right . firebird segment absolute perfection thrills me each viewing , centerpiece film , wherein al hirschfeld-themed new york city panorama spreads out unabridged accompaniment george gershwin magnificent rhapsody blue , one love ! re-use sorcerer apprentice took up time might've made available fresh material , but seeing old favorite restored lavish color treat . some segments fantasia 2000 more uneven than others , but i don't think there bad one bunch . this , like 1940 fantasia before it , joy watch time after time . fantasia 2000 stands its own work originality , i hope third volume this series arriving soon	1
i netflixed this surprised results . cybil sheppard likable , but bruce willis , one whom i thought i'd like show abrasive ( not " fun " abrasive ) generally hammy . i could not like show because i could not like his character . worse still , chemistry two simply cold awkward . totally lacking spirit warmth remington steele miss laura holt . humor grating sometimes embarrassing . some reason certain shows just seem stuck time period they arrived moonlighting far one , uh , stuckiest . sound cues feel like they yanked terminator one ( not good thing ) . there brief interview section disc one where they brazingly put down other shows time period gloat how they created something " different . " if cold , dated , impersonal " different " than i guess they . i would wager many here who give this 5 stars viewed it its original time frame fans all , though i must say looking this outside , it quite honestly , train-wreck . i feeling show " could " get better but i won't around reset tracks	-1

this smart , well-crafted heist movie , which i enjoyed much more than earlier heist ( which just too overly self-consciously clever all back-up plans odd dialog ) . three main actors , brando , norton , de niro all turn exemplary performances , probably one only time all three ever worked togegther . watching de niro use all his safe-cracking skills fascinating , something most us probably know nothing . after all , one doesn't meet high-level safe-crackers every day . :-) safe-cracking scene thermal torch made some spectacular cinematography what all sparks , way de niro figures out how open safe so quickly inspired . commentary dvd , they mention that way it actually happened when they filmed it , it spectacular scene , but i won't say anything more so not spoil it you . but you'll see what i mean when you come it . ending also surprise , unobstrusive musical score adds drama some nice mood touches where they're appropriate . overall good flick worth your time money	1
there few more beatific images than youthful ingrid bergman framed her nun habit , looking skyward glistening candlelight end this 1945 holiday classic . director leo mccarey bing crosby reprise his role father o'malley their film year earlier , " going my way " . both really reflect type films would more likely show up tv movies family channel if produced today , but wartime audiences obviously need such cinematic salves . what reassuring how films remain affecting today if rather unabashedly sentimental . what sets this one apart crosby natural ease role ( certainly far more muted than he bob hope road movies ) incandescent bergman portray sister benedict . pacing leisurely , first part film establishes two stars their roles before going into slim plotline , which sister hoping rich curmudgeon named horace . bogardus donate new , expansive building st. mary academy take place rundown old building sisters schoolchildren inhabit . mccarey - screenwriter dudley nichols - both pioneers screwball comedy , focus lightheartedness story until couple sentimental developments occur . first lonely student named patsy , who comes idolize sister benedict , point intentionally failing graduate order avoid going back home her concerned mother estranged father . second involves sister benedict medical condition which forces father o'malley make difficult decision st. mary . there fewer songs here than " going my way " - title tune one , " aren't you glad you're you ? " , both sung effortlessly crosby swedish folk song performed warm alto bergman . soft-centered philosophical discussions two leads generate some interesting conflict though nothing feels irreconcilable end . there also some amusing scenes well , example , kindergarten class unaffectedly improvising christmas play bergman showing off her pugilistic prowess boy beaten up fight . while i much prefer bergman her more outwardly seductive roles ( " notorious " ) , i see why people wanted so much see her glowing embodiment good during wwii , even though it this image harbinger when she caught extramarital scandal roberto rossellini five years later . crosby always seems playing himself , which this case , good thing . henry travers , forever clarence me frank capra " it wonderful life " , plays bogardus appropriate stubbornness compromised regret , joan carroll , least prominent smith daughters vincente minnelli " meet me st. louis " , gives solid performance conflicted patsy . this understandably well-loved film even if it runs bit too long	1
young white boy growing up navajo reservation very wonderful , this movie brought back many wonderful memories . navajo friends i , all rode mustangs so therefore our weekends spent riding through bueatiful high deserts northern arizona . this movie great movie , it all emotions person may feel 1880 . some what , i felt when we moved northern arizona 1960 . people wonderful grow up . this movie great movie , only problem i dvd see bonus features you special computer . i would happy spend extra money movie , if they could just put it dvd . i would very much like see extra parts left out , unless you computer read these extra parts . other wise i would given this movie 5 star rating	1
movie : one boldest most interesting films early 90 , one deserved far more acclaim attention than it ultimately recieved , this smartly written beautifully acted film should seen any cinemaphile open mind . despite whining some , usually hardline christian , corners , it not anti-christian all . what it simply great , imaginative clever film making , superbly character piece centered around magnificent performance mimi rogers , ably supported likes david duchovny , patton patrick bauchau . i'm not going go into it too deeply simply because it one those films should seen experienced little up front knowledge possible . ( please note i'm not attacking christians or christianity above , just small , but , usual , vocal closed minded minority always gets up arms any film dares tackle any such subject any degree honesty instead going down traditional biblical fawning path . people who instantly hate film like this just " principle " then proclaim all they should avoid " such trash " . you know exactly kind people i'm talking . they're minority , they just happen very vocal closed minded one . none anything their christianity much it their absolute closed mindedness their fear anything dares stray certain comfortable path . ) dvd : good news , this film finally dvd , pretty decent audio commetary boot . bad news , movie badly misframed , which something becomes obvious couple key scenes especially . i'm not sure whether this form censorship ( misframing one scene effectively nullify sequence any real nudity it once ) or whether it just botched transfer , but it clearly misframed regardless i saw this film twice it theatrical run framing different now than it then . plus misframing quite obvious anyway , audio commentary you even hear remarks film pertaining parts print no longer visible due said misframing ( so clearly they watching film it proper framing ) . unfortunately this doesn't appear available anywhere else dvd , so if you want film dvd right now this your only option , just aware going , hope better release somewhere down track . apart framing issue sound audio quality perfectly fine , only other notable extra film trailer . bottom line : really good , bold , interesting film disappointing variable quality dvd . mr	1

honestly , only line missing this film : " oy you , i shoot ruddy soviets too ! get them jerries , i ! " actual soviet stalingrad veterans so offended inaccuracies movie insulting way which movie portrays soviet army , they asked russian parliament ban film russia . acting downright lousy stupid highly unnecessary british accents . stupid british kid posing russian spy , stupid british guy posing soviet sniper ... even bob hoskins ( american ) throws fake uk accent ( so irritating ! ) but ultimate laugh when ed harris mixing english german together his sentences . just annoying altogether . they should this film soviet-era russian third reich german , executed so well " downfall .

federico fellini 1972 film not his best , when he 8 1/2 , la strada la dolce vita his credit . while many critics adore this film its absurdity plotless , dreamy structure , i found it boring phantasmagorical . it simply fellini version rome not rome , eternal city itself . risk sounding negative , i shall admit there some moments which it most expressive early 1970 rome - scenes which hippies american tourists invade city , long scene outdoor restaurant where everyone talking their heads off ( though saying some pretty vulgar things ) my favorite scene- underground archaelogical excavation which frescoes old roman patricians fade into oblivion . but mostly this film weak it bored me because there no plot . it starts off alright , movie works well when there no sudden fantasy sequences . fellini himself this movie , well gore vidal . fellini envisions himself young man studying rome his youth strict catholic school ( slide/projector shows ancient monuments like colliseum , apian way , trevi fountain vatican well offensive pornographic image woman behind ) later young man journeys rome itself takes residence large family crowded apartment slum . then young man sees talent show tasteless , vulgar long-winded . i found myself just unimpressed outraged audicences went far throw dead cat stage ! it bothered me there much attention prostitution , brothels or cheap , slutty women . cover film promiscuous woman start film . film rome italy , there hardly any allusion opera or any true classical theater . pope fashion show ludicrous blasphemous . only serious , hardcore fans fellini want own this dvd . it perfect follow-up his equally absurd sexually radical satyricon , loosely based old roman epic .	1

good western starring clint eastwood released 1985 bringing more developed plot variation " high plains drifter " released several years before . film benefits good screenplay script which there more well developed characters keep audience interested . film set small mining town where independent miners terrorized boss who owns mine adjacent town . clint eastwood rides into town " preacher " sides beleaguered miners against local boss . film remains mysterious whether " preacher " really man or ghostly apparition past coming claim revenge past misdeeds . town boss eventually hires crooked marshall his posse take care preacher there seems past connecting them together . preacher almost leads one think he main character " hang ' em high " because noose mark his neck he hides scarf . this certainly one eastwood better westerns good plot extensive character development . film also certain element supernatural no one knows exactly whether eastwood character living man or avenging ghost coming out past . overall excellent film worth renting or owning	1

new yorker reviewer ( above ) might better suited hard news ; he obviously doesn't much understanding imaginative art . he should least remember cliche artists use lies reveal truth . he criticizes " eternal sunshine " " implausible " -- hmm , doesn't seem hurt reputation " tempest " or " midsummer night dream . " i think maybe reviewer should watch bloody thing eight more times , if that what it takes get it . i blown away ( admittedly bit confused , making me want watch it again ) first time i saw it . charlie kaufman borrowed little best sci-fi altering bit reality help him examine human condition . this isn't linear story , it meditation love , fate , regrets , choice , second chances - if you knew how it turns out , would you it again ? he may answered old question whether we choose who fall love . i may watch movie again really get under surface what happens lengthy sequence carey winslett character travel through his memories he tries hang her memory . i think carey winslett both give incredible performances , kirstin dunst . if nothing else , kaufman , gondry , cast remarkable job revealing how fragile we all - even guy who raiding clementine memories joel woo her himself comes across more sad then creepy . this , ultimately , very tender film . when i read dickens or shakespeare , i sometimes get sense author genuine affection characters he created , i get same feeling this film .	1

advent dvds , i've made it minor hobby compare various versions shakespeare plays - especially othello , lear hamlet . i not see polanski macbeth until recently but aware it decades . my view this single most powerful film adaptation any shakespeare play . though much too intense children or even most teens , polanski artful direction captures insanity , mysticism , jealousy , hate , horror playwright most brutal work perfectly . settings gloomy but realistic acting uniformly excellent . if polanski never made film , he would still remembered vividly capturing complex intensity this play . even jaded modern audiences emotionally exhausted film end- which not easy this age ubiquitous violence sex . this no holds barred shakespeare ; definitely not faint heart .	1
event this movie based so despicable john singleton ( director ) add fictional characters so it wouldn't look shameful rosewood really . some fictitious elements ... 1 . mann ( ving rhames ) character 200% fiction . not even loosely based any historical person . so ending , when mann shooting mob train ... never happened . 2 . emotional distraught racist duke ( bruce mcgill ) son , emmit , fictional not based anything historic . added dramatic purposes obviously . 3 . sylvester ( don cheatle ) died real life during shootout not return heroically horse beside train pick mann up . far i know , rest if pretty accurate .. reality , during massacres like rosewood , heroes like mann sylvester first die . but i knew when i saw him escape lynching , cutting himself down , shooting mob when he escaping train his character based " some " fiction . but then i found out his whole character fictional . singleton create hero , or else black folks would killing people when movie over . i wouldn't blame them . i remember i could hardly sleep night i saw movie . during events like this , not one person faced any charges . not one ! jon voight , always , gave hell performance . his character , john wright , obviously racist , but not bigot . but when he witnesses lynching folks he known years his face , he change heart arranges his friends who owns train passes rosewood pick up black women children . michael rooker , sheriff walker , great job law who could not control his town . he , too , racist , but still wanted order . black preacher movie typical religious uncle tom . proving karl marx theory religion role oppressive societies correct ( drug keep oppressed people satisfied belief after-life ) . read black wallstreet too . i'd like see director make movie . anton batey	1
nutshell : seems crazy , perhaps even insane , today but . . . half century ago , everything we now see " atomic cafe " not only seemed real , but it designed provide us ( effective this ) both motivation security weather nuclear age every way -- or least what we believed ! most all , propaganda provided fear which provided us motivation maintain vigilance we thought needed honorably provide security our way life . we wrong ? : atomic cafe means different things different people ! i live through shelter drills cuban missle crisis , but what it all meant relative propaganda shorts such " duck cover " we may never fully understand . we really need atomic weapons ? anyone ? atomic weapons something added , or detracted , our security ? what rest world ? yes , passage time reveal great deal nuclear age our policies . " atomic cafe " used sort historic tour-guide this recent era effect media us through excerpts official government films times . propaganda always seems so ridiculous superfluous when it put historic context , so what makes this type propaganda different significant ? maybe question can't answered yet , but see " atomic cafe " you may part answer . video : since this video essentially pieced together old propaganda films , quality transfer less than ideal start . add , " atomic cafe " made these already old film scaps 1982 , we see this going tired-looking video terms state its preservation . i not seen dvd yet , but i think i should probably buy one before this vhs copy wears out . bottom line : should fitting requiem nuclear agethis documentary needs seen appreciated it different though valid significant meanings different people	1

`the cider house rules ' succeeds delivering touching thought provoking melodrama that only elevated prime acting part it entire cast . homer , toby maguire gives one his better performances , although i still feel he comes across bit nervous uneasy , if he not too confident his own acting ability . this though offset brilliant acting part his co-stars , like michael caine charlize theron who embody their characters come across like seasoned veterans we know they . film follows homer , young orphan who raised maine orphanage dr. wilber larch ( caine ) who takes care orphans if they his own trained homer take his place . one thing homer could never get used illegal abortions , safe they , wilber insisted performing . it through one these abortions homer meets candy ( theron ) wally ( rudd ) . he decides leave orphanage them take work apple orchard . this course troubles larch homer closest thing he ever real family . this movie touches upon so many controversial subjects , abortion ( which controversial no matter who you talk ) well incest drug abuse , but it so taste tact intelligence makes this film much more impressionable . upon closing credits viewer given lot ponder , lot digest , but that tell tale sign movie this caliber , movie message , its job . i personally think `the cider house rules ' one those movies we all well experience ourselves	1
each these movies treasures . yes they old sometimes slow . yes , sound not excellent . we all seen them one time or . still , they filled some greatest movie quotes all time . when ronald coleman says famous line " tale two cities " , " it far , far , better rest i go than i ever known " , you can't imagine anyone saying it better . when laurence oliver , speaking his pursuit " lizzy " tells greer garson " pride prejudice " " .. chapeter definitely closed " , you seeing best mr. darcy miss bennet ever filmed . yes even better than kiera knightly . but total surprise , you get see w.c. fields " david copperfield " . who would known how great actor he . i still check out if this direct quote book or something fields made up when he says ... " copperfield , i nothing bestowe but advice , still , advice so important i never taken it myself ..... " enjoy these movies .	1

this film excellent , not too long not too short , light mood would make emily bronte proud . love casting sinead o'connor eb herself beginning end ! soundtrack only element gets bit much - same series notes over over doesn't really justice visuals . even though ralph fiennes juliette binoche visibly considerably older than teenaged- early-twenties heathcliffe catherine story , they very believable . other presentations wuthering heights polished , " sexy " heathcliffe who just isn't right since heathcliffe monster through through . fiennes carries it off beautifully barely sublimated savagery showing through every scene , yet remains sympathetic somehow . binoche mischievous smirk perfect cathy who more succubus than , instance , merle oberon glamorous princess 1939 version . i don't often buy movies own repeatedly view , so my shelf favorites not large , but this movie prominent among them .	1

filmed early 70s just past easy rider woodstock epilogg 60s generation this film gloomy mood , kind after christmas depression one first 2nd half hippy era early 70s it looks dated but i think it intended way good way . barry newman car delivery driver after recent depressing life vietnam veteran , corrupt law enforcement possible suicide his girlfriend . film defines mental statis mind racing many vietnam veterans turbulant 60s early 70s who side him . he spent he knows it so he just dont give damm anymore hes out his last dash . 70 dodge chalenger he drives simblizes its last hurrahh well fast car factory winding down 1970 last year cars get faster . after year they started cutting back energy crisis follow . dodge speaks its mopar domination best speedy cars hemi supercharger pistal grip 4 speed shifter . although some may argue car star thats ok well . it looks good , sounds good , owns road , well little while . he driving denver san francisco meets some more depressed people way including cops , want [ ... ] robbers , desert burned out old man , hippi cult jesus freaks , hippi biker , blind disjocky , best guys naked blond riding bike who ask him sex but his chronic depression turns her down . he popping pills stay awake not appear any water desert his life unquenched very unsatisfied . best europian vergion when he picks up girl who desires wants him but its only temporary feel good , its only dream then back his nightmare his falling apart life . they block road 2 bulldozers but he could went around them . its like they gave him choice car him flash like his life 60s history . this movie defines period best like no other never like	1
this movie awful , completely inaccurate they made it seem like she just some crazy person who slept her way top . nowonder people think so badly marilyn monroe . i'm sorry but you not become pop culture icon stupid . that what they made it seem like . according this movie she only made three movies high all time , always horny illiterate . movie they even said " i get top even if i sleep every man hollywood " but really you think it though , they this every great artist . so i suppose that why they it here . they it michael jackson man mirror , mozart beethoven they make it seem like they no talent accendently became pop culture figures.so, sum it all up . you would dumb marilyn monroe portrayed like this movie ... belive it	-1

i agree some reviewers here , this dvd needs upgrade . it too great funny not time investment make this dvd worthy film . however , until new dvd comes , i settle what i . this film discussed length , i would just like add if you never seen this film , yourself favor buy it . not rent it . buy it . it good . tim burton made classic ghost story [ he made many great films ] but this film where i first became really interested his work . film stars young ( geena davis ) ( alec baldwin ) husband wife who recently died . they don't know they dead first , but come realize they never survived their accident . however , they new people home they once occupied : they don't like it . ( jeffrey jones ) funny this film , his character his wife ( catherine o'hara ) delightfully funny . dark broody daughter portrayed ( winona ryder ) who befreinds two recently departed ghost . however , main character ' beetlejuice , ' who portrayed very funny ( michael keaton ) . he helps rid ghosts pesky intruders : but cost . film funny well worth purchase . highly recommended . [ stars : 5+	1
ok , i saw this movie years ago when it first came out i rented it vhs dvd few times , still don't own it yet . this good friday 13th movie , but best thing this movie way they brought jason back file . you tommy jarvis now around 18-19 years old losing his hair , he escapes mental institution his side kick ( arnold horshack ? ) anyway , he goes cemetary rainy night dig up jason face his past once all . but after opening coffin seeing jason dead body he goes crazy ( obviously not taking his meds ) pulls metal pole cemetary fence starts stabbing jason while dead man still coffin . after calming down he throws jason mask down grave gives jason few choice words . all sudden lightening strikes pole while it stuck jason body . rest they say history . jason comes back life goes work . these movies so subjective , i loved it one best , last " real " friday 13th movie . but i would rent it see what you think before you buy it . i own parts 2-5 all good films , part ii probably best . i need part one , part six then my collection complete , nothing after part six important . part 8 funny watch , but not worth buying , but ending really good though	1

adventures superman began production its last two seasons ( aired during 1957-58 ) , series more or less overcome its tight budgetary restrictions evolving into veritable universe unto itself . it wacky universe indeed , operating under its own screwy story logic often totally disconnected any semblance reality . gangsters would watch their bullets bounce off superman chest then , emptied their cartridges , throw their empty guns superhero , if would stop him , or superman pals never seemed realize man kypton mild-mannered reporter clark kent one same , mattered not one iota its legion young viewers . fans comic books , big-budget movies tv shows recent decades , adventures superman rightly appears quaint times depressingly cheap , but if you stick it , chances you'll find it peculiar but very real charm all its own . this year hollywoodland , superman actor george reeves ' last years struggling actor private eye investigation following reeves ' death ( barely year after last show aired ) , adopts curiously contemptuous attitude toward show especially its fan base . though young children took its wild stories face value , many adults very charm show its good-natured goofiness . adventures superman one most iconically ' 50s/eisenhowerian programs its era . superman , after all , fighting not only truth justice , but also " american way . " instead super-villains like lex luthor , superman foes more likely communist types , ironically enough union activist robert shayne , actor who played superman ally inspector henderson metropolis police , during its run subpoenaed appear before house un-american activities committee nearly lost his role it not members cast crew who rushed shayne defense . wonderful example this very ' 50s tone " atomic captive , " cold war masterpiece . after russian fifth columnists fail bring back russian-immigrant nuclear scientist ( loyal naturalized american citizen ) , daily planet reporters jimmy olson ( jack larson ) lois lane ( noel neill ) drive out desert interview him . however , scientist dying radiation poisoning , so " hot " his mere touch likewise fatal . jimmy lois rush , naturally ignore his pleas not go near him , each pawing man reckless abandon . when scientist tells them they've just given themselves fatal dose radiation , all jimmy turn lois say , " golly miss lane , i guess we're . " making matters worse , they then drive out into desert , taking short cut through " ground zero " nuclear test site , wrongly figuring they wouldn't possibly reschedule h-bomb test they flown out cover first place . well , they wrong , take full force nuclear blast , just like glenn manning amazing colossal man . how superman save day ? you'll tune yourself . this complete lack common sense part lois jimmy used throughout these later seasons , apparently kind shorthand propel narrative forward without need lengthy ( logical ) character motivation . " perils superman , " imposing man lead mask ( michael fox ) shows up daily planet grimly announce he devised fiendishly imaginative means " liquidate " lois , jimmy , clark , planet editor perry white ( john hamilton ) . within minute or two after he leaves , lois perry blithely off meeting , business usual . it no surprise then they're kidnapped minute they get into lois ' car . then again , if nothing happened them , there'd no show . budget precluded superman actually performing feats grand " changing course mighty rivers , " but production values these later shows better than those when show began . seasoned b-movie directors like lew landers howard bretherton helmed episodes , star george reeves , while instantly recognizable character actors like jack kruschen , john banner , cyril delevanti , laurie mitchell , billy curtis ( martian mr. zero ) , dabbs greer , joi lansing populate episodes . serial fans likewise delight such familiar faces dale van sickel , tristram coffin , i . stanford jolley , usually playing villains . video audio adventures superman : complete fifth sixth seasons full color presented its original full frame format episodes varying quality . opening titles all shows tend look awful , but episodes themselves generally very sharp bright , super-saturated hues reminiscent early two-color technicolor . series used same shots superman leaping out windows flight over-and-over these modest effects probably never color-timed new footage , hence they tend stick out like sore thumbs . mono audio okay , optional subtitles french spanish . extra features only extra superman pal : jimmy olson , brief tribute jack larson charming performances throughout run series . he interviewed once again , noel neill superman historians jim beaver , gary grossman , michael . hayde , jan henderson . there no mention reeves ' untimely death anywhere discs , or anything various aborted attempts revive series some form years followed . parting thoughts though adventures superman scripts leave all logic door , stories these last 26 episodes pleasingly close spirit light-hearted tone era comic books . neill hair becomes almost phosphorescently orange both reeves larson fleshier features , reeves ' hair little grayer thinner , larson no longer 19-year-old youth he when show began , but youthful excitement still greets show remains unabated .	1

when blue lagoon came out theatres , i 17 , my parents refused allow me see it . it wasn't until i 29 , married cable i finally watched this contraversial film . while i still think it more appropriate actors 18 years old , rather than 14 , due mature themes nudity , this not your hot sweaty sex movie . you get buffy vampire slayer just any daytime/primetime tv , these days . what story 2 cousins , eventually left their own , trying survive eden-like paradise , innocence children natural curiosities adolescence brings . they love , gently affectionately , they child , they content . when ship nears , they make mutual decision remain island not try rescued . word , they complete . while acting overall pretty pathetic , script trite many places , there some poignant moments ; em " meeting " god laying flowers his feet so they would not make him mad would go heaven . richard contemplating bleached skeleton paddy realizing his own eventual fate , well em his son . mutual decisions not saved , well saying farewell each other after eating poison berries , when accidently drifting out sea . one cannot but heartbroken when they found asleep , rather than dead , because there no place society them . they belong paradise , director should let them die . even music becomes sad rather than jubilant . scenery gorgeous , beautiful score , acting fairly bad . so , why we keep returning blue lagoon ? because wouldn't we all like marooned gorgeous tropical island our perfect love left live simple fulfilling lives paradise ? 5 stars idea , 2-3 acting , so gave it 4 .	1

i seen chinese odyssey many times , because it just so funny ! chinese odyssey not really remake chinese classic , journey west , but it more parody , or side story based monkey king . chinese odyssey period drama set ancient china . here , monkey king , sun wu kong ( stephen chow ) reborn ( although he doesn't know this yet because he yet find particular person who " confirm his identity " ) , he now leader bandit group . two demons ( spider " white-bones " demon ) suddenly appear one day forcefully " force " bandits their bidding . there , story moves include time-travel , romance , friendship self-discovery . there plenty twists turns really different original story , which good since it doesn't get boring even if you already know story monkey king . however , minus you'll need know story monkey king able appreciate laugh some jokes aimed original story , but if you don't , there still plenty comical parts around keep you laughing . funny parts may rather silly times , but go ahead laugh their silliness . afterall , stephen chow known king comedy . :) end part 1 , you'd probably feel like ending too abrupt somewhat cliffhanger , but chinese odyssey comes two parts , so you'll need watch part 2 well able fully understand entire movie . if you into chinese mythology culture , give this try take time enjoy this show !	1

i not realize how old sound-track this made-for-television animation until carl reiner , interviewer , set scene , saying , " plane landed idlewild . " sound track probably taken record released 1961 . president jfk still alive ; his family no compelling need name things after him . so , airport still idlewild , not kennedy . according sources who asked remain nameless , since naming them would give away their real ages , mel brooks , 2000 year old man himself , carl reiner performed this little interview throughout 1950s , but never recorded it . i seem remember reading somewhere , perhaps new yorker magazine , first recording took place reiner home , sometime late 1950s . after dinner , reiner turned tape recorder , walked microphone over brooks - dear friend guest - set scene . then he asked first question ... i impression challenge new one brooks , but if my sources correct , they predict there would no weapons mass destruction , brooks reiner through routine many times before fateful night . now , i ask , tape transcribed onto record , or duo it again vinyl ? i don't know , but i suspect they recorded it few times . reason details . review appeared new york times 1975 , when animation this video first broadcast cbs television network , there quote : " i 25,000 children ... not one them ever writes ! " video quote " i 42,000 children ... even one them ever come over visit ? " so , perhaps time media home entertainment picked up animation marketed version i , 1984 , some things changed . who knows ? both versions joke funny , unless you sitting home , dark , waiting your kids call or come over , which case neither version funny . but seriously , " tragedy when i cut my finger . comedy when you don't look where you going , fall hole , die .

literally . flatland edwin abbott abbott little gem book which could not pigeon-holed into specific genre over hundred fifty years ago result ended up science fiction shelves . combining geometry philosophy ( even religion ) , it allegory human condition , describing very rigidly-structured society where square pegs aspired fit through round holes . plot focuses . square , who led series epiphanies nature reality itself realization not only there existence beyond his two-dimensional plane form 3-dimensional universe , but further dimensions implied . he learns appearances not necessarily all they seem . difficult conceptualize its reading , llad ehlinger , jr. managed graphically express this evolution mind . despite these worlds populated exclusively geometric shapes , we drawn into story feel . square transformation though it our own , which it hopes . flatland itself appropiately extremely two-dimensional , yet endearing qualities . our hero perspective , he first confused , then exhilarated he lifted into three-dimensional world . we taken dizzying ride . this only beginning . square , who then postulates other worlds both less more dimensions . ehlinger sequence which only homage 2001 : space odyssey multi-dimensionality explored . if this not big enough task tackle , ehlinger expands storyline applying some original concepts governments their logical path war . flatland , both book movie , appreciated many levels . adding extra layer , ehlinger actually simplified book . i enjoyed this movie . it mind-bending thought-provoking , graphic element integral its message . potentially too-heavy treatise lightened very humorous details , such warbled battle cries female lines flatland , who need both sway make noise all times order seen when not approached their sides , so not pierce unobservant polygons ! there more than meets eye this unusual independently filmed marketed movie . one viewing may not enough	1

this classic western one sam peckinpah greatest . i found dialouge chemistry james coburns pat garrett kris kristoffersons billy kid mesmerizing . kristofferson very young this part fairly inexperienced actor but it doesn't show one bit . costumes period portrayed perfectly . characters dirty , crash , wild . there many colorful characters portrayed lot famous character actors you probably seen ton movies . slim pickens also here brief but memorable role . kid garretts friendship what holds movie together even though they don't show their early outlaw years together they don't . you feel two long relationship their friendship runs very deep . check this movie out if you want see great western just plain great piece movie making	1
i waiting movie like this years years , finally something made not complete hackwork containing nothing but nudity barely mentioning name hpl , even though posing " lovecraft-film " . i watched movie fellow lovecraftian , we greatly pleased adaptation . i never quite understood why teeming masses chose this particular tale hpl their object obsession , since there great number fantastic tales hpl vastly more memorable than call cthulhu , but i'll grant it indeed fine tale , even including journey norway it pages ! there not so much say movie , it ( once ) very true tale , so perfectionist i am , i didn't find much complain there . i loved opening scene wreck man telling tale understanding listener , his face unforgettable ! i only two small criticisms make , one fight-scene swamps , i found this quite silly , something nearly wrecked movie me my friend . other end , where great cthulhu reveals himself . i acknowledge they limited budget , but i just didn't quite enjoy him much i would liked . said , scene where man falls into wall while fleeing his divine attacker something i'll never forget . absolutely splendid ! whole island just perfectly , i adored it . bonus-material interesting , but i hope there few normal people out there who enjoy hpl too , not only bunch strange freaks , like many people behind movie undeniably . said , i really enjoyed film , apart minor criticisms i've already mentioned , i highly recommend this excellent adaptation set style 1920 movie	1
this film treated something like lost child canon director woody allen career . if he would apologize this instead , say , " curse jade scorpion " . what allen attempted here his directorial debut groundbreaking . this first example i recall director telling his film mock-documentary style , later employed albert brooks perfected christopher guest . allen proves himself not only great comic visualist but there great verbal puns here well . conceit film gas . we're supposed believe allen virgil starkwell , inept dweeb criminal , if not among fbi most wanted cause mr. hoover some sleepless nights . gags here rapidfire but i wouldn't spoil it those who uninitiated . my favorite , though , virgil orchestrating prison break gun he fashioned out soap during rainstorm . all this failed effort leaves him hand full soap lather . also , noteworthy cast late janet margolin virgil faithful wife . margolin basically plays straight woman allen but it shame this gifted actress who so good " david lisa " didn't more substantial film career	1
this movie story monty kessler ( brendan fraser ) , senior harvard who thinks his thesis his life . his computer fries ( surprise , surprise ) monty , perfectionist he decides go make copies it second his computer dies school copy center . only problem he slips falls while en route loses thesis boiler room one harvard libraries . he one his roommates then sneak into library ; only monty can't get his thesis back because old homless man decided use it firewood , only give it back him page page-a good deed per page , . initially monty decides use old man , whose name turns out simon wilder ( joe pesci ) not old he looks-to get his thesis back . but monty takes liking guy , all but one his roommates , two become very close . monty winds up learning lot simon ; result movie predictable many ways not predictable other ways . basic formula before , but this movie still good one , not awful but not best movie out there . it one those movies you watch over over again not tire . my book it gets four star rating . again , not best , there better movies out there , especially likes brendan fraser joe pesci , but worth your while . dvd this movie contains absolutely no extras i able find , not even music video main song " i'll remember " madonna .	1

remember when steven seagal hot property his action films decent ? well don't expect this wearisome retread . seagal plays jonathan cold ( thank god they didn't call him jonathan hott ! ) , agent some deep dark secret covert organization " four columns " ? tamara davies requisite hottie agent who wonders what seagal up carries like most female agents these romanian movies -- makes one dumb move after . storyline ( ho hum ) centers terrorists out set off nuclear bomb downtown los angeles . seagal hardly seen during any his few hand hand combats , pretty much confirming beefy actor stuntman all work , which there very little . preposterous chase scene garbage truck reminiscent roadrunner cartoons its lunacy . two stars hammy but effective performance john pyper ferguson villain . least he looks like he fun	1
otto preminger follow-up his ground-breaking film noir " laura " off-beat , dark foreboding tale con man eric stanton ( dana andrews ) who arrives small california coastal town literally no money his pockets . he soon under spell sultry waitress stella ( linda darnell ) . they no dough marry , however , so stanton plans get hitched wealthy heiress , june mills ( alice faye ) , then get rid her take her fortune . stella , however , not exactly sitting idly - she many boyfriends dates infuriate her lover . ultimately , things don't go planned ; stella found murdered eric prime suspect . surprisingly , june stands him tries him cleared . david raksin again provides haunting theme , dick haymes providing vocals stella favorite song , " slowly " plays repeatedly diner where she works . relationship andrews darnell very daringly portrayed 40s - what preminger able get away amazing - i'm surprised censors weren't all over him ! faye andrews actually end up sharing same bed motel room ( although their characters married this point ) but considering production code , it amazing scene not cut out censors . charles bickford provides right amount suspicion , cynicism ulterior motives local police detective who knows much more than he admit . darnell role stella turning point her career - she went portraying virginal heroines tarts femme fatales . her chemistry andrews explosive ; it could almost considered entanglement calls restraining order . faye blondness darnell dark brunette coloring give distinction heroine temptress . this film most remembered fact this last film alice faye would make over 20 years - she so angered because much her screen time reduced favor darnell ( although she placed blame studio , not linda ) , she left lot huff threw her keys guard . dvd transfer great ; it looks especially good since film out circulation so long . interesting extras , including photo galleries , theatrical trailer , commentary noir expert eddie muller dana andrew youngest daughter , susan , who gives some wonderful insights into this under-appreciated actor . not classic " laura " but definitely good example what dark film noir all	1
rebel without cause first movie james dean i've ever seen . i plan watch his other two because this one so good i didn't want it end . james dean one most beautiful actors i've ever seen . it wasn't just way he looked , ( though helps course ) but he also this charismatic way him makes you want watch his every move . i think that why , i watching movie , i started noticing he reminded me very much character ryan atwood oc . i first noticed way james dean looked people . he same manner ryan oc . james dean moves his eyes right or left sometimes instead straight ahead . his eyebrows raise slightly his smile never more than grin . it very endearing quality it why i noticed it so quickly into movie . then i noticed way james dean smoked . james dean made smoking cigarettes look like art form instead something could cause cancer . lol first episode oc , ryan took out cigarette he talking marissa he looked exactly like james dean . time though , i just thought ryan very " cool " " sexy " since i'd never seen rebel without cause . i no idea two looked so very much alike their mannerisms . there other similarities movie oc , such mansion trio run movie , model home oc where teens there go hide ryan . i'm not sure if this look character ryan atwood purpose make him seem like ' james dean ' type or if storyline just coincidence but my point saying all this i think kids today relate this movie . even though rebel without cause made over 50 years ago , teens today deal parental issues , peer pressure , rejection feelings first love . i would recommend this movie anyone ... especially teenagers .... who get tired same type movie they see over over . rebel without cause true classic i hope anyone hasn't seen it , gives it chance watches it just see themselves not all movies old , ' old fashion ' boring . this one great it one i could , watch many times . i'd really like add oc fans should watch it just see what i'm talking . i'd like see if anyone else noticed what i .	1

i know plenty people completely shocked i find billy madison adam sandler best movie date ( most argue me it happy gilmore but i could not disagree more ) . billy madison perfectly silly movie requires no thought need not overanalyzed . it adam sandler movie crying outloud , not ground-breaking documentary , so get over it . if you enjoy adam sandler somehow missed billy madison , you need go get it right now . billy madison ( adam sandler ) coasted through life his father dime . his father preparing retire wants leave his hotel empire his only son , but billy just wants drink sun all day live good life ( can't say i blame him ) . however , due billy lack responsibility drunken penguin-chasing ways , his father can't good conscious turn company over billy . plus , his dad admits he paid off all billy teachers first grade let him pass . his dad wants turn company over man named eric who worked him years , but eric evil guy . billy doesn't want eric gain control his father hotels so he throws log fire - he comes up idea return school take each grade over again order take over company . course , this where movie takes new silliness . i'm not saying this oscar-winner or anything like , but if you've bad day office or just need something mindless amusing zone out , billy madison movie you . adam sandler some great movies out there , but billy madison still remained my favorite one , even after all this time . absolutely recommended	1

you pretty much know any film featuring both john candy dan aykroyd going generate some laughs , making great outdoors pretty safe bet anyone mood little comedy - comedy basically all you should expect here ( any film supplies subtitles raccoon conversations isn't really trying express anything meaningful ) , despite fact john hughes wrote script . once , hughes ' involvement more harm than good . while great outdoors certainly good movie , it not very good john hughes movie . course , it hard follow 80s classics like breakfast club pretty pink , but hughes ' heart just didn't seem this one . this best demonstrated teenaged romance part story , which stumbles start really goes nowhere all . when you come right down it , there just isn't any real depth any characters this film - that just not something you expect get john hughes . all chet ripley ( john candy ) wanted nice family vacation country , week relax his wife bond his two boys , especially older one ( frankly , i'm not really sure why younger son even movie ) . what he got " surprise " form his brother-in-law roman craig ( dan aykroyd ) his rather strange family ( annette bening playing mrs. craig ) turning up out blue vacation right him . you can't just tell family get out , though , even if family includes arrogant , rich , know-it-all like roman . chet his best grin bear it , but you know it just matter time before he loses it . when inevitable happen , it triggers series important events re-draw some main characters , even giving roman heretofore unsuspected ( albeit rather narrow ) depth . despite this , strangely insignificant summer romance buck ( chris young ) local girl ( lucy deakins ) , great outdoors really just plays laughs nothing else . some more memorable scenes include chet wild water ski ride , course , battle pitting chet roman against bat . you'll definitely laugh several different moments , but film never really elevates itself side-splitting plateau comic genius . many ways , this pretty safe comedy - it doesn't break any new ground , but it really comfortable fit . would okay many filmmaker , but great outdoors just doesn't live up john hughes ' usually higher standards	1

um ... maybe because our attraction visuals ! first off , ignore all reviewers who complain this story line isn't most imaginative ever thought up , therefore give this fantastic movie terrible review . main point this movie it visually fun watch ! movie starts zevo toy founder kenneth giving dying wish his military brother leland : brother take over toy factory when kenneth passes away . kenneth son leslie ( robin williams ) true love company , but lacks leadership skills really take over company ... until leland starts making toys into actual weapons use kids all killing . this forces leslie come grips some serious issues what really important him , makes him couragous leader ( captain patrick zevo , leland son ) toy army take leland insanity . i'm not big fan or rap any means , but i really got kick out ll cool j performance this movie , it fun watch his character develop into toy-factory loving guy . robin williams brilliant usual , rest cast enjoyable well . most important scene this movie definitly fake vomit testing room turns into potentially deadly crossword puzzle - but there many other visual treats well ... enjoy !	1
i first saw this movie child , age 8 , ever since i loved this movie , most important fact it darker , more interesting , adaptation oz story . dark side this movie may scare children , it myself , but it not overwhelming or too extreme . fact , this movie strikes fine perfect balance darker elements , so typical child , over age 6 or so , scared good way . this because darker sides this film represented things children really should watch out real life , such stranger adults , temptations wander far off home . characters unique original , set designs visual treat . this movie must see people who want more substance than overrated sappy ' wizard oz ' movie pathetically timid judy garland . this movie , fairuza balk plays much stronger compelling dorothy , who we respect believe . overall , this movie far better than any other oz movie terms its dedication original books .	1

truffault brilliantly brought screen cornell woolrich outstandingly paranoiac thriller , bride wore black . who but moreau could played role relentless avenger who finds so many inventive modes destroy those who killed her husband . church steps ! i like truffault ending better than novel contrived ironic one . novel , though fine , lacks melancholic weirdly comic quality film . it film puts one uncomfortable position rooting its murderous heroine though one her muders especially distressing both her us because victim endearing . but see yourself	1

going i assumed this film suave player ( campbell scott ) who charm women end up passing this skill down his nephew . i only half right . during set up we actually find out he sort prick . if he likes you he uses his elocutionary skills flatter you . if he bad day he using them debase you . then his 16 yr . old nephew enters picture asks help ladies . normally he might not " waste " his time helping human , but i believe it creates nice distraction current turbulation his life . this film primarily takes place during one night . scott bss his way throughout evening trying teach his nephew thing or 2 . they interact couple chicks bar , elizabeth berkley who i enjoy jennifer beals who i find highly overrated . they like boy naivetivity . scott then continues night trying get boy laid while night gets seamier seamier . there definitely some truthfullness this movie , such when scott tells his nephew closing time scenario which everyone gets depressed just don't want alone . end it seems nephew may learned thing or 2 even though he'd probably retain his sweetness . scott may or may not change , but i think it more scene lonliness than any one or 2 characters . this film really seem push you into movie . i often felt uncomfortable , just like real life . this look filmmakers going it really worked me .	1

seen theatrical release " fanny alexander " several times through years , it taken me while set aside time watch miniseries whence it came . film , course , won four oscars including 1984 best foreign film -- widely regarded ingmar bergman most personal masterpiece . i've always appreciated film , but never really put it among my favorites -- but experienced it anew 5+ hour miniseries version , might just changed . i'm not going delve into plot particularly , but more my response viewing experience . opening takes place during grand family celebration . extended version , this full ninety minutes . within this time , we meet immediate family , extended family , servants , friends -- literally dozens people . you get sense relationships , real feeling dynamic within household -- true appreciation theatrical roots ekdahl clan . fanny alexander play minor roles all merriment -- no one given more screen time than anyone else . while this all very nice , you might not see real emotional impact this opening until end film . fact , light tone beginning doesn't prepare you what follow . subsequent episodes , fanny alexander lose their father . then year later , their mother remarries religious leader forsaking her past material belongings . it these strict , unforgiving settings real drama starts unfold . while i taken break after first episode , i continued watch rest " fanny alexander " one sitting . it absolutely enthralling drama . nuanced performances , battle wills plays out next three hours like great theater . it intense , thrilling , powerful , haunting , even times ethereal -- pitch perfect screenplay words chosen carefully maximum impact . much acclaim given cinematography direction " fanny alexander , " that all excellent -- but words perfection . there plenty terrific performances contribute impact film . i especially captivated ewa froling emilie , fanny alexander mother . jan malmsjo , showiest role new stepfather , alternately evil strangely sympathetic . scenes these two resonate me long time . so consider me convert -- i am now raving " fanny alexander . " while opening may seem bit long uneventful , i promise you'll see sweetness impact it brings ending . so watch longer version , stick it you'll greatly rewarded . kgharris , 11/06	1
i really enjoyed this show , although like other reviewers i seen here , i wished she little more older material . still , you understand she catch up her last three albums , since there no tour right after bedtime stories or ray light . most show material ray light music , which two really good albums . she opens " drowned world ( substitute love ) " , then dives right into " impressive instant " , one best 2000 music . there few songs i wouldn't included personally . i think she should replaced stuff like " candy perfume girl " , which i don't think terrible song , i just wasn't feeling it show . it kind fit into creepy skin head-punk theme she going though . also , " beautiful stranger " isn't bad song either , but it didn't much me live . we also could without " mer girl " live song . it nice pretty , but kind makes energy fun come screeching halt . images bruised bloodied madonna weren't very flattering either . still , i could understand way show worked ; almost if it all juxtoposition beauty ugliness . i liked it because it departure her usual live fare , but some costumes hair just hideous ! i hated kill bill/ninja outfit " sky fits heaven " , but i enjoy jumps kicks . i like " frozen " costume-that amazing should remained stage longer than it . i liked they included one remixes song well mix it up bit . i love " nobody perect " studio song , but not live . then , i bit over whole madonna-as geisha thing . " nothing really matters " might made better song somewhere however . western set included such songs " don't tell me " " gone " really good " human nature " much welcome return older material . loved mechanical bull ! it all very cute well . " funny song " not very necessary , though it meant novelty , stupid those who wanted maybe older song it place . also , i think dixie chicks already made song killing cooking no good man . " secret " one my favorites ! i absolutely love this song played live . last couple sets best my opinion . i loved " what it feels like girl " espanol ( could without remix accompanying disturbing anime screens ) . course , " la isla bonita " brilliant , usual closers " holiday " " music " right point . overall , it dvd worth buying . madonna genius putting all this together so many different themes ideas . while i disagree few apects it , mainly song choices , it wasn't my show . it madonna show i'll get over it . i like some other tours little better though . but it all good	1

first let me say if you like shows like office ( both uk usa ) or larry sanders show or curb your enthusiasm , you love this show . like those shows its shot documentary style makes it feel if you these characters lives . i first saw episode newsroom pbs . i immediately struck genius ken finkleman ( shows main star , writer director ) . where office shows you satirical view office life newsroom shows you equal satirical view toronto newsroom life . how " leads " news cast chosen ( i.e. higher body count ) mundane issues george news director gets hung up ( getting parking space buildings garage ) you find yourself laughing others misfortune . all genius this show i very disappointed three episode long finale . i guess it trying make statement narcissistic ways george but it just wasn't funny ( thus 4 instead 5 stars ) . said , last episode ( where characters transported political situation ) again genius . this dvd well worth your money	1
i'm sorry , i plead addiction , but i loved this series its first episode . i still remain true it . writing excellent , characters believable you really connect them . but best part mystery whole thing . all questions bubble surface your mind when you're watching show . it keeps you edge your seat , hungering more . it show really makes you think , i love . some people didn't like this particular season much first two because they didn't understand show still climbling toward climax . things aren't picture perfect , but they interesting . my only complaint it too short , here list episodes .... 1 . new world , part 12 . new world , part 23 . tom baldwin4 . gone , part 15 . gone , part 26 . graduation day7 . home front8 . blink9 . ballad kevin tess10 . starzl mutation11 . gospel according collier12 . terrible swift sword13 . fifty-fift	1

this one weirdest video adapatations novel i've ever seen . novel early work jane austen ( published posthumously ) so it not well crafted later works . despite novel weaknesses , however , even this video production not it justice . heroine looks like she heroin , maj . tinley ( played same guy who played older doctor " all creatures great small " ) positively creepy , his son , henry tilney , smirks instead smiles , thorpe sister just plain ugly ( i should say she just plain plain ) tilney sister stiff . i can't remember whether other videos this novel available this one i chose or whether there no other choice . only value video me it helped establish who characters their relationships -- before i read book . they say , " book better , " this case , old saying couldn't more true	-1

+++++ " intolerance jews fact 16th century life , even venice , most powerful liberal city state europe . law jews forced live old walled foundry or `geto ' area city . after sundown gate [ geto ] locked guarded christians . daytime any man leaving [ geto ] wear red hat mark him jew . jews forbidden own property . so they practiced usury , lending money [ ] interest . this against christian law . sophisticated venetians would turn blind eye it but religious fanatics , who hated jews , it matter ... " this how this wonderful movie begins above words printed on-screen so orient viewer . this movie based controversial troubling play " merchant venice " ( written circa 1596 ) william shakespeare ( 1564 1616 ) . main plot this play movie concentrates follows : sixteenth century venice , when christian merchant named antonio ( jeremy irons ) must default large loan jewish moneylender named shylock ( al pacino ) his friend bassanio ( joseph fiennes ) who romantic ambitions rich portia ( lynn collins ) belmont , vengeful shylock demands cruel substitute repayment antonio . movie proceeds we hear these famous words uttered shylock : " he [ antonio ] hath disgraced me ... laughed my losses , mocked my gains , scorned my nation , thwarted my bargains , cooled my friends , heated mine enemies , what his reasons ? i am jew . hath not jew eyes ? hath not jew hands , organs , dimensions , senses , affections , passions ?... if you prick us , we not bleed ? if you tickle us , we not laugh ? if you poison us , we not die ? " shylock continues : " if you wrong us , shall we not revenge ?... if jew wrong christian , what his humility ? revenge . if christian wrong jew , what should his sufferance christian example ? why , revenge ! " aware end movie , you may not know whether you've seen tragedy or comedy ( play officially classified comedy ) , love story or tale hate . its infinite ambiguity , movie play said quintessential shakespeare . also , aware movie entirely elizabethan language . if you not used this kind spoken language , i would strongly recommend you turn closed-captioning . ( dvd , unfortunately , not english subtitles . ) one final caution : there bare-breasted prostitutes appear briefly . they not put movie make it more risqu� but rather add some historical authenticity . venetian law time required all prostitutes bare their breasts because christian authorities concerned rampant homosexuality city . thus , this movie `r ' rating because this ( which i think ludicrous ) . acting this movie word -- fantastic . i surprised this but al pacino thoroughly convincing shylock , very complex role . i also give credit jeremy irons ralph fiennes who fine jobs their roles antonio bassanio respectively . cinematography excellent . movie filmed location venice , veneto ( region north italy ) , luxembourg . background music exquisite . i heard lute , harp , other instruments i'm not familiar . i learned later some music contributed baroque string quartet . ( baroque period art period circa 1600 1750 . ) background vocals mesmerizing . finally , dvd ( one released 2005 ) perfect picture sound quality . it few extras . bottom line : this movie worthy addition bard cinematic cannon . ( 2004 ; 2 hr , 10 min ; wide screen ; 28 scenes ; rated `r ' ) +++++	1

oh my , this movie god-awful . it feel throughout group first time actors playing medieval dress-up dragons camera . special effects consist computer-generated dragons extreme overuse people backs getting set fire ... that pretty much it . plot also very weak so typical . fighting scenes horribly choreographed acting so bad it looks like first time efforts every actor except two kings theldag . picture ben stiller slight beard , medieval clothes , wig . that hero this calamity movie . there also typical trite very poor attempt humor spattered throughout also . this definitely low budget title . it also 4:3 full screen only . i consider this movie purchase one worst i ever made , but it cheap . you get what you pay	-1
first season six feet under featured astonishing acting/writing/directing , truly amazing new show . however , show began lag part way into second season . it lost its witty death related humor , began lose format original shows . decline second season culminated clich� cliff hanger , typical shows don't know how maintain interest . season three starts confusing premier which includes massive jump time ejects viewer out show , further illustrates writers ' budding ability not deal tough issues . season four show fully declined into rather lame incongruent night time soap , standard love triangles , mystery deaths , psychics . they also managed fully lose their format , beginning death dictating tone show . one episodes starts death based anti-lsd agenda , after first scene they completely ignore issues kid who died . i'm pretty sure fisher sons diaz didn't even embalm guy . some point massive amount useless sex they added show , extended kidnapping episodes become nothing more than unpredictable uninteresting . if you enjoy first season six feet under , quit while you ahead . however , if you enjoy shows like alias , lost , days our lives , their cliff hangers , disjointed action , love octagons , then i would advise you party !, enjoy last few seasons . bottom line : if you looking good tv , kind where pain , humor , love dance similar fashion life , watch first season don't waist time rest . if you just love characters no matter how strange they written , continue all means ; plot doesn't get worse , just writing acting directing . porn factor : season four people just random sex , story lines seem little better then bottom barrel porn . so , i guess , good soft core porn win	1
one could review kingdom heaven lot levels ... action packed medieval adventure/romance ... vehicle some your favorite actors ... or statement humanity less than perfect attempts find spiritual meaning life way doesn't lead warfare people differing points view . i expecting mostly first two ... pleasantly surprised find reasonable amount third . my favorite quote movie summed up powerful feeling i've spirituality some time now : " god understand , my lord . if he doesn't , then he not god we need not worry . " why people so infrequently ask themselves whether god they believe really makes sense their hearts or not , i don't know . when i heard these words coming screen , i realized " someone out there understands ... we don't find god books or doctrine or sermons ... we know god our hearts , or not all " . this character looked his heart knew ... god understand ... anyone who doesn't surely not god , no matter what someone else might claim . if you loved movie , you'll enjoy this dvd ... it classy widescreen handling film that visually rich deserves seen it cinematic format . gorgeous scenery delightful characters costuming , i can't imagine watching such visually appealing film less than wide screen form .	1

i remember watching these shows young boy telly during summers ' 89 ' 90 when i off school staying barnbury park nearby islington . all shows i vividly recall loving this 1st season red dwarf . more so than later seasons . it minimalist cast , low budget simple plot idea 1st season shows not only got me into sci-fi futher but shaped my overall sense humor sarcasm . nothing i've seen america comes close red dwarf . positives : one most original starts any show i think . all episodes season 1 , whiles not funny later seasons tightly produced every aspect plot well thought out dialogues very clever brillantly acted out . if anything , red dwarf during early seasons remined me alot black adder episodes shot mainly one or two rooms whole time consisted mainly very clever funny " stage-like " dialogue 2 characters trying deal each other their problematic environment . no negatives me but : these not average commercial , mainstream fast food tv shows easily eaten quickly forgotten . there lot intellegent charm , wit well constructed science fiction plot situtions here entertain everyone . this season rewatchable ( more so than later seasons ) not catch dust any collection . it needs re-watched really appreciated . however some aspects jokes not understood everyone who not familiar british culture or know what curry vindaloo ... then again my 12 year old cousin , who never england or remembers much 1990 , doesn't know what vindaloo or even familiar time travel science loves show .	1

phenomenon could one those syrupy , maudlin-filled stories we've handed , but thanks intelligent script , astute direction jon turteltaub stunning cast , this movie poignant , touching affirmative nod human spirit . john travolta one his best performances plays george , auto mechanic who one night " sees bright light " , stunned it wakes up changed . he now obsessed knowledge , learning , he little telekinetic boot . how this affects him people his small town overrides obligatory governmental intervention subplot . travolta marvelous so rest cast : kyra sedgwick relation-phobic young mother who object travolta affections ; robert duvall superb doctor/friend who tries get travolta through this change ; forest whitaker his farmer buddy . fact , whole cast right target support this remarkable leading performance . phenomenon touching , offers look how travolta friends find themselves both awe fear his newfound powers	1

i love saint i enjoyed watching episodes contained set 1 saint . however , i terribly disappointed when i found out set 1 only contains 6 episodes . effectively , price set 1 , same entire season many other great shows . i think this real rip off ! i'm certainly not going buy more saint dvds until producer brings down price more reasonable range .	1
i wasn't sure if i going like this movie i admit i only watching it actor jared leto first ( i also really like nicholas cage , but would not watch movie just him ) . i really got it though when it over i loved it it left me little upset it over . it gives you some inoformation arms dealing very interesting . it movie gives you whole range emotions ... you laugh , you get angry , you want cry ... i would highly recommend this one everyone	1
while oliver stone 60's-style " hipness " intrudes too much into characters situations , overall film good honest portrayal nazi-like terror inflicted this country police military beasts human form . associated amnesty international this time i'm well aware real people who tortured , mutilated , raped , murdered , " disappeared " name " western values . " this film not only portrays true face el salvador bloody evil little civil war , but moral callousness us funding this descent into hell . us self-righteousness over bosnia kosovo decade or so later seems all more incredible , one watches american complicity mass murder here	1
though based famous character phil silver famous oldie tv show , new " sergeant bilko " less homage show than it classic steve martin his 1970 days . though this bilko ( again shifty tireless grafter , evil face non-coms everywhere ) very much opportunist silvers ' character ( he runs base casino ) , shy risk silvers ( unit mobilization orders desert storm mysteriously disappeared ) manages get caught his own dealings silvers ( bilko botches fixing army boxing match , unwittingly tricking each boxer think he one who supposed take fall ) screwball zaniness very much out steve martin snl days . script bilko unit charged testing brand new army weapon - " hovertank " soon cancelled because , among other things , it simply doesn't work . hovertank end spell doom his own cozy position doesn't seem bother bilko , mostly because he lives day-to-day . things change when officer charged evaluating hovertank turns out fearsome major thorn ( phil hartman ) . years earlier , bilko unwittingly made enemy thorn accidentally implicating him one his bitched schemes . now major , thorne isn't simply content enough eliminate hovertank , but must now axe bilko well . they say desperate times reveal man , bilko now revealed spineless weasel his troops come love . martin plays bilko like character one his old snl skits . it sort fun watch guy work material we haven't seen since his more sedate days playing less zany funnymen ( " la story " , " roxanne " ) more mature dramatic roles ( " spanish prisoner " , " grand canyon " update " silas marner " ) . it light breezy you'll probably forget most gags , script under-uses most supporting cast ( especially now late-great phil hartman bilko evil nemesis ) , but it still fun	1
i admit first time i saw this video i laughed out loud . why ? four grown men t-shirts kilts playing rock roll . wow . well , now when i laugh it shear joy ... their fantastic seasoned , fun , high energy performance . bruce plays his heart out ; tony , cool ever , ads his own magic bass ; mark drums -- clear crisp -- really showcases his talent . stuart .... he blast . you see his love affair audience , he gives above beyond energy , extra guitar solos , , well , like i said , you could tell he fun ( not much fun perhaps he berlin peace concert -- man , there he shining , too , but younger " look this crowd ! " bright eyed commanding demeanor ) . back final fling -- here you see mature stuart company comfortable their scottish colors .... tennis shoes ? tony black ankle boots , which hoot itself . i've said lot visual this dvd but i add audio outstanding ... mesmerizing . this fantastic dvd .	1
" cuba " represents best verite style richard lester . if you're looking traditional narrative or big star vehicle sean connery , you'll disappointed .

veteran english teacher i've taught this play all my career i never tire it . although some acting over-the-top times ( consider parents ' reaction helen condition first 10 minutes film ) , this classic nearly flawless . anne bancroft patty duke won well-deserved oscars their dynamic performances andrew prine made career out playing roles like his " jimmie " this film . script intelligently adapted play author william gibson even cleared up vague scene play implied annie might quit kellers . direction sturdy unobtrusive arthur penn who went very distinguished career . this wonderfully insightful inspiring film holds your attention beginning end . it little sentimental times , but that very forgivable . note : patty duke plays helen this film , but 1970 remake television she plays helen teacher annie sullivan . talk clever casting	1

what happens when little max reede ( justin cooper ) blows out candles his birthday cake wishes his dad couldn't lie anymore ? fletcher ( jim carrey ) unscrupulous lawyer ( there any other kind ? ) happens max father . when birthday wish becomes reality things quickly begin fall apart poor fletcher . after all , what good lawyer who can't lie ? one thing certain , fletcher discover how much truth both hurt heal . first let me say i'm not generally jim carrey fan . i find his films inane , vapid predictable . his excessively loud , over-the-town acting style absolutely drives me crazy . said , i must now confess i've found one exception rule . exception unrelentingly hilarious ' liar liar . ' all things drive me insane jim carrey somehow work wonderfully this film . it also contains cast some my favorites ; maura tierney fletcher ex-wife audrey cary elwes her new love interest jerry . i also mention very sexy krista allen makes brief but memorable appearance ' girl elevator .	1
sudden death i got this movie because i powers boothe fan , came like film itself . it gotten lot poor reviews , but i disagree i think film lot value mainly because chemistry actors . my favorite parts film those interaction emily joshua foss ( powers boothe character , never mentioned name except ending credits . ) duel wits these two priceless this best character ( emily ) powers boothe ever plays against my opinion . i believe it bears much more resemblance two `under seige ' films than `die hard ' its critics claim . children make this film so unique , they big part why characters where they , when they ; why plot unfolds way it . there violence , probably young children shouldn't watch it , but older mature teens might like it because emily tyler . this film deals , least surface level , many issues such government ineptitude , job-related disability , divorce/marriage/child custody , more . powers boothe , dorian harewood , colm meaney terrific villains . powers boothe especially plays great sociopath , low baseline mood , superficial charm emotional distance --- although more insight than most . whittni wright plays emily mccord , nothing listed imdb her after this film --- pity really i would love see more her . ross malinger plays tyler mccord he terrific , i'm happy see he moved good things since . film scored john debney , it his worse piece work ; subdued especially action film , unoriginal , not outstanding any way although believe me i've sat through far worse . there official soundtrack release but good luck finding decent-priced copy . debney went wonderful job `passion christ ' , whodathunkit he got well-deserved oscar nomination it . my gripes : this tenth anniversary we please widescreen release i think we've waited long enough , collector edition powers boothe commentary would nice but i won't hold my breath ... not lot extras dvd , but few good behind-the-scenes items ... idea noone needed go inside or outside stadium during game , or noone would cellphone or there would media blackout something like this really stretches credulity . it worth $10.00 price just good piece cinema history . i would like see prequel or sequel , say , emily joshua foss meeting up someday but now i guess thanks `deadwood ' powers boothe too famous sequel ( foss seemed quite dead film end , but this hollywood after all ) . finally : recently audio book `sudden death ' released audiotape narrated powers boothe , it terrific worth price if you find it . if you disliked movie you might like this audiobook , if you liked movie you'll love this audiobook	1
housewife named brandi typical torchlight releases . almost non-existent story horrible , pointless dialog ties together several very long sex scenes . story ? brandi buys computer . she sets up website sell lingerie , where she models lingerie front webcam . people make fun her site , so she starts sex her female friend husband front webcam instead . guy two other girls see site decide same thing steal all her business . end , two camps decide merge . that it far story goes . there six sex scenes . three boy/girl , two girl/girl , one boy/girl/girl . expected torchlight , scenes long , nine thirteen minutes . this good bad . most time it good , because all women video attractive good job during their scenes . few bad moments occur when director gets stuck some shot isn't particularly hot or interesting instead cutting away something else , it just drags one or two minutes . but overall , i thought sex scenes good . there four women video . ander page , april hannah , nicole luv , remy . ander page only one i recognized . she three scenes . audio video quality excellent . there no extras dvd all . i liked this dvd don't regret buying it . but torchlight stuff not something i unconditionally recommend . you not going get story or any dialog even remotely interesting , sex scenes going run three four times longer than what you'd see something like playboy softcore flick . but me , primary reason watch softcore sex scenes , this one delivers area quite nicely	1
i several pilates videos which i use regularly , since i own one ana caban earlier videos , i decided get it . routine fast-paced - not beginners - it filled new twists ! some exercises challenging , but i am confident i eventually master them . 15-minute bonus workout good when i don't much time . i like ana , she no-nonsense instructor takes great care producing quality workouts .	1
i enjoyed this movie , but , some my friends thought it got bit tedious after concept ' madness ' one main characters became clear ... comments like ' she really didn't spend much time studying script ' , or ' remembering her lines ' started float around room .. course if you like me enjoys character studies .. well thewn you'd rate film 4 stras .. otherwise i'd suggest you pass this one ...	1
this movie provides glimpse into lives lower middle class english youth whom savage battles over football matches never heard towns most important part their otherwise quietly desperate lives . poignant interplay two old men movie somehow made film seem more real even more sad . fight scenes really seemed capture chaos confusion lifestyle . no explanations given no apologies necessary . it held my attention start finish . good watch mature folks ; randomness violence intermixed snippets private life made movie seem more real me . i order this after watching it friend house - he huge soccer fan i believe he picked up movie europe . recommended	1

3 story-arcs classic dr. who , this really good price set , especially one including logopolis castrovalva ( both which i've tempted vhs just see them again ) . these part iconic tom baker run 4th doctor end his final season role . k9 gone , romana . he wears his plum digs suit somber mood his last 2 stories : keeper traken , logopolis , castrovalva . disc one : set opens keeper traken which reintroduces master ( absent since showdown doctor deadly assassin ) . end his 13th incarnation ( 12th regeneration ) he stays shadows ( so speak ) much 1st half this one , but end he literally new man . this one introduces nyssa , eventually become new zo� , brainy-girl board tardis , while adric , equally brainy but not really sensible also board all 3 these ( when they learn super-genius kid annoying archetype ) . plot this one shaky but necessary reoccurring role master 5th doctors run . disc two : next logopolis . if keeper traken somber , then logopolis literally wake before funeral . doctor more visable distressed over leaving romana e-space ( still waiting dvd e-space 3 set ) . his plans fix long broken tardis chameleon circuit logopolis . before doing so , he must find real police call-box measure , but doing so inadvertently lands around " new master " tardis , which ultimately leads death doctor ( well mortal wounding anyway ) . loads moody shots , out tardis , lots quirky labyrinthine scenes future companion tegan lost onboard . new master terrifically , theatrically hammy plays nicely off baker manic energy ( although substantially drained his standards , character doctor seems stoically accepted his impending death baker stoically accepts his retirement . ) he leaves top his game here , great , great story . disc three : castrovalva introduces 5th , youngest doctor ( time i'm not sure tennant age ) . peter davidson , brings character away 4th doctor style borrows heavily older doctors ( spite his youth , he plays it more like stogy old original incarnation played william hartnell . ) when filming , shooting order altered so , although this first new doctor episodes , it shot after four doomsday ( story 2 season ) . so davidson knew where his regeneration addled transformation would end up , because he already filmed wholly recuperated doctor . but process hard one , castrovalva opens immediately after doctor regeneration , his companions try get him safety , narrowly escaping master , or so it seems . while doctor struggles retain/ regain his wits ( see brilliant scenes doctor struggling not lose his way unraveling 4th doctor iconic scarf ) . crew falls deeper into master web traps arrive castrovalva , appropriately named after m.c. escher work . great start new doctor . new beginnings : drinking games drink whenever you hear " cloister bell " ( ringing which means emanate danger or drunkenness)drink when master watches / rebukes doctor gloomy safety his tardis console room . drink whenever one actor or character replaces via regeneration / body snatching / disguise or miscasting . drink whenever someone misplaces doctor ( including himself ) . drink whenever anyone declares : " but , doctor there ! " drink when any tardis crew complains . this one pays off !	1

this movie pinnacle blaxploitation films . lead character black man who wrongfully imprisoned then cruelly experimented jail . when he gets out , he unique pinnochio-esque talent . but , it not his nose grows ... think lower longer ( ha , ha ) . i could not stop laughing he killed his enemies his " secret weapon " . this movie not meant taken serious , but it accomplishes something other blaxploitation films this time not ... truly unique storyline	1

first all , i'd like point out incident mentioned review lupis1 takes place second season jeeves wooster , not third . however , i agree this season some very good episodes ( though not good second season ) . major fault i jeeves wooster dvds , like many dvds same genre , there little none way special features . " interactive menu " not count special feature . i would like see some audio commentaries some bbc dvds -- see what hugh laurie , stephen fry ferdinand fairax say process turning wodehouse memorable characters book screen . characters incredible , plot-lines hysterical . best episode " hot off press " .	1
this series deserved more seasons than it , though final season wrapped things up quite nicely . i still think resolution end rather un-fair though . those who haven't seen end episode , i am not going give it away . but introduction new mainstream characters , only lifespan one season ... can't good . but over all review , i very much enjoyed third final season .	1

i hadn't seen this while until recently , it still me my toes . this came out when i high school , but i didn't see it until after i graduated ... but i remember hype it " racy " . i really didn't know what think it first ... but after seeing it few times , it grew me . maybe it sex ... or crime drama thriller ... killers getting away killing ... or combination above . i remember hearing reading stone mixed-review performance beforehand , but after seeing it myself , i personally thought it fit character . you never really trust her , although times you almost want . i hadn't even really seen douglas any movies before this . if you liked this , than fatal attraction must see well ( i didn't see fa until after this one ) . throw here beautiful score jerry goldsmith ( which classical musician i noticed ) , well what become one my favorite dance tracks since i heard it high school , la tour " blue " dance club scene roxy . far flaws , i agree reviewer realism her antics she getting questioned . what wrong these guys , what really makes her so special ? they really haven't seen anything like her , polygraph guy says ? that main thing bothered me , but it movie , long you know , don't take it too seriously . there lots funny moments , esp . curran friend gus ... " that magna cum laude ***** fried up your brain !

many reviews here already indicate , this film not everyone taste . set dublin , it reflects something sensibility modern irish drama , its harsh , black-comic edges its ambivalence sentimentality . ensemble piece loosely weaves together more plot threads than viewer hope follow or account after seeing whole film , it capable cast skillfully portraying broad range characters , not any them particularly sympathetic , though you find yourself cheering some their small victories . yes , colin farrell fun watch charming but sociopathic skinhead . but all their brief fragmented moments screen , there standouts rest cast well , including colm meaney , whose character seems wish he tough cop " miami vice , " wistful kelly macdonald young woman who just wants steady man , even if he married , cillian murphy her totally hapless boyfriend job he hates stocking shelves supermarke t.t he movie farcical riff many different forms anger . almost everyone grievances lead them everything rage depression , which many viewers begin wear thin after while . there exhilarating relief while we witness spectacular bus crash , later film cuts back forth two simultaneous car chases , each them ending badly . finally resolving all this high-powered negative energy bit more than this film manage , ending rather unsuccessfully brings us soft landing . but then endings not easy anyway , what you remember film its oddball moments , which capture better than anything desperate measures people take while looking love all wrong places	1

after i enjoyed martin scorcese " departed " , i decided watch film inspired celebrated director re-make it move action hong kong boston , ma , usa . i must say i liked original movie better : 50 minutes shorter than scorcese magnificent remake , " infernal affairs " tighter , faster , more compelling tells same story better . it not grand acting jack nicholson who basically plays daryl van horne attitude " infernal affairs "' characters don't talk don't curse much they " departed " but hong kong movie only benefits it . much i admire leonardo dicaprio bill castigan , tony leung ( yan ) his role simply unforgettable	1

there so many possibilities . this spy thriller . it works several levels , quite bit comedy keep it light . i interpreted much character development satire british people themselves . hitchcock careful . those last days before war british censors tough . if british didn't see humor it , i'm sure americans . you two chuckle-headed school chums prattling endlessly criket . cheating barrister his vapid paramour both married back england parnoid found out . then there miss froy , ( dame may whitty ) old , sterotypical spinister governess . even heroine , iris , played margret lockwood , blond ( naturally ) beautiful airhead , her facile , soon boyfriend , gilbert ( michael redgrave ) . miss froy goes missing train without getting off . she just made aquaintance iris then , poof , disappears . iris help gilbert seeks find her annoyance most everyone aboard train . but miss froy isn't what she appears . she secret agent british germans want kidnap her . only they weren't germans . order not offend nazis time , germany simply refered middle european country . they phony , german sounding accents like evil psychiatrist who identified czech . brits pulled themselves together when crisis hits . train stopped attacked police . miss froy amazingly nimble old lady . she jumps out train window evades 24 young men shooting her . hilarious . she gets back england before everyone else . see this . if your not hitchcock fan you maybe after seeing this , one his last movies before he moved hollywood .	1

this documentary , released concurrently hard-cover book same name 1991 , brief but highly accurate overview life art billie holiday . book , text robert o'meally , contains literally hundreds rare photographs , good deal these liberally sprinkled throughout film . but ultimately , it sparsely produced but flawlessly executed narrative her life craft make this dvd stand out among few biographical pieces released great lady day . film contains interviews several billie closest friends musicians who worked her . insight provided fellow jazz-singers friends carmen mcrae annie ross indeed enlightening , but it observances her fellow musicians , mal waldron , buck clayton harry " sweets " edison , well particularly eloquent comments writer jazz historian albert murray , make this documentary particularly illuminating . there snatches billie greatest recordings , which consist excerpts illustrate exactly what so unique lady genius , often accompanied explanations what made her music so important , or perfectly timed clips jazz audiences dancers day , reveling music . one point , trumpet player harry edison remarks billie jazz musician , way she used her voice , " attacked words could swing just like trumpet player " . his comment immediately followed brief clip her 1936 recording " i can't give you anything but love " ( teddy wilson his band ) which she exactly emulates sound instrument her voice . albert murray sweets edison carefully explain , once all , billie not blues singer , but jazz singer - very best jazz singer , while buck clayton , carmen mcrae mal waldron clarify billie first vocalist use her voice dramatically , change melody phrasing songs fit her mood , improvise written music create form art original it unique . they make you understand billie holiday literally influenced every singer came after her ; this film makes it possible someone little prior knowledge her , or her craft , understand exactly why she such important influential figure both popular music jazz singing . simply put , billie holiday changed way singers sang songs , this film articulates this fact vivid clarity . film goes out its way ( book ) correct some more glaring inaccuracies her biography , not flinch somewhat sordid sensational details her tragically short pain-filled life . same time , portrait one someone who certainly enjoy their life fullest despite tragedy , billie revealed basically happy cheerful ( if often abused ) person she really . throughout we hear actress ruby dee read some more accurate portions billie " autobiography " - lady sings blues , book she didn't write , probably never even read . also worthy note contributions producer milt gabler , who relates story behind billie biggest hit , " lover man " , which he produced decca records 1944 . there also well-orchestrated effective buildup song " strange fruit " , social political aspects which carefully explained milt gabler ( who labels it , " first important protest song " ) . he relates columbia records refused record it , fear " bad press boycotts " their southern dealers . annie ross says , " i knew it banned , i knew why it banned " , while carmen mcrae simply states , " just straight up facts , you know , way it those days " while they all express their admiration billie her brave stance african american , who dared sing song lynching pre-civil rights era 1939 . discussion followed late clip billie , looking absolutely radiant , singing song before television audience , while accompanied mal waldron piano . expressions drama etched her face while she runs through powerful lyrics , ( " southern trees bear strange fruit , blood leaves , blood root ; black bodies swinging southern breeze , strange fruit hanging poplar trees " ) right through dramatic climax , ( " ... sun rot , tree drop , here strange bitter crop " ) make this video potent testament her amazing valor artistic perfection . there other rare wonderful ( if much too brief ) video clips billie holiday her best , sometimes , stark shocking end her life . one clip begins particularly sickly , ghostly looking billie , her appearance nothing less than alarming , but clip progresses we realize poor video quality , combined unflattering camera angle bad lighting , make her look far worse than she really . moment later camera switches angles , relief we see she far more elegant healthy-looking than she appears onset clip . we also get brief scenes her only film , new orleans , louis armstrong , made 1947 . while billie sings song " blues brewin '" , close-ups give us rare glimpse into what it must like experience real billie holiday ; she sings words , " ... suppose you want somebody , but you ain't got nobody , you only got gleam your eye ... " , her expressions absolutely brilliant . there not only gleam her eye , there wrinkle her brow , lilt her gestures contractions her facial muscles , all combined , communicate range feeling show expression lesser singers could never hope convey . priceless . climax film celebrated clip her singing her composition , " fine mellow " famous 1956 television special , voice jazz . accompanied several her peers jazz world , including ben webster , lester young , roy eldridge gerry mulligan , cameraman wisely chose concentrate billie face , even soloists took their individual turns , we get delightful look billie playfully nodding her head time beat , appreciation talents her fellow musicians clearly showing her eyes motions . some viewers expressed disappointment fact more video clips billie not presented here , forgetting ( unfortunately ) there very few video records remaining her performances . i believe i now seen , through this other available videos , most her surviving video performances , this film contain some very best them . but inclusion those few precious video clips notwithstanding , it explanation billie art clear articulation her genius make this documentary so gratifying . film closes story her life , albert murray comments , end , it , " eloquence , universality her statement matters " most , while carmen mcrae reflects , although much billie voice gone time she recorded " lady satin " , there something her voice , even then , could evoke intense feeling , miss mcrae says she still plays album , cries . over credits , we hear few bars " i'm fool want you " lady satin , we instantly know exactly why carmen mcrae found it so moving . highly recommended .	1

if one film could some up ouevre jean luc godard it would probably ' band outsiders ' .. it great example french new wave .. many godard pictures plot not important - its like he saying - yeah , yeah , we've seen this plot million times before lets just use it means improvisation .. raoul cotard cinematography we see paris all its glory - filming streets like no one else .. yet despite all this playfulness ' band outsiders ' plays one godard most wistful , melancholic films .. maybe it score legrand ( who capable much better ) - but everytime i see this movie combination music image never fails make me get extremely tired actually doze off - i like this movie ! yet this what makes me hesitate calling it godard best ( though it contains some his best moments ) .. so i would say this must godard fans .. my personal favorites godard ' breathless ' ' pierrot le fou ' - although it hard beat minute silence ..	1

i sat through this entire film even after my wife begged me turn it off then stormed out room watch tv living room . she bored tears felt premise unbelievably stupid . little she know , i completely agreed i just this thing only seeing part movie . i finish it , even if i knew i gonna hate it . me idea anthony hopkins could black man so unbelievable i couldn't even begin concentrate meat film . i understand novel acclaimed everything , everyone , even critics feel this film loyal novel , but if that case then novel can't great . if they chosen actor i could believed it maybe , i mean , i light skinned black friends i know they could pass white , but when they tell you their black you see features ... anthony hopkins whiter than i am ... there no way i could pass black so hopkins out . really if it weren't excellent acting parts hopkins , kidman harris this movie would no redeeming qualities . so here you it , young black man looks white , realizes it easier just play white then who you , he disowns his family live his life easy , he becomes teacher now his 70 he accused racist people who think he white so he starts affair much younger woman whos drunk husband wants kill them both , he , then his secret exposed this guy who wants write book him . i just such hard time getting over idea some idiot thought anthony hopkins could black i can't even see this movie good it . i'm sorry ; this review probably so tainted it not even funny . all i know this great movie , i mean even premise something i would normally really enjoy it just so hard get over ... i'm rambling ... never mind . like i said , i really tried	1

when ellen evans directed this movie she managed get sex scenes energy , passion , sensuality , creativity . fans softcore know how rare these things . just how skilled director accomplish them . which make directors cut this movie ( which sold here ) such mystery . my only guess when she given chance reedit this film she wanted make version she could watch her 14 year old daughter , or maybe she trying get job hallmark channel . what ever reason if you fan oxygen network buy directors cut , if you fan softcore get original version .	-1
i disagree totally above reviewer . these films excellent . only one i am not thrilled hill , all others very good wwii films . i waiting command decision long time . this collection not disappoint	1
this one single most beautiful films i ever seen . unfortunately , i found story line just bearable . there lot fantasy involved perhaps it metaphor something i haven't grasped yet . regardless , it just didn't pan out me end i found myself wishing it better written . said , i need reiterate : this one single most beautiful films i ever seen . there one particularly bad cg sequence , but beyond , it visual masterpiece , hence five star rating despite lackluster storyline . i highly recommend it if only sheer unequaled beauty cinematography .	1

i rented this movie mostly because they goof it " 40 year old virgin . " i like caruso csi miami , but i begun see caruso always plays david caruso . yet , here he plays even less cheerful cop . what fun . his character jade so stoic he makes dirty harry look like neurotic . sadly , this one those erotic thrillers neither thrilling nor erotic . it better than your usual shannon tweed erotic thriller twaddle , mostly because you get chaz palminteri supporting character rather than , say , william katt . plot makes no sense , however , sex scenes boring . if you want good-looking sex , rent some porn . if you want good thriller , rent rear window .	1

never even heard this 2002 when this released , 2002 great year itself sci-fi . we star wars ep2 , solaris my favourite sci-fi film up point ... minority report . then only couple weeks ago , went down my local hmv store saw this shelves sale . my expectations wasnt very high , but i am big fan . bale me , he always engaging . after putting this , 107 minutes later , i hooked . not way i utterly impressed like minority report when i first watched it , but somehow , it certainly me thinking movie theme , gunkata fight sequences , which so awesomely jaw-dropping it outdid anything matrix ever fraction its budge t.t hen i watched it again commentary , i caught all details i missed out first time . then it hit me , this great film . no , make it supreme film . 2nd time around , i noticed cinemtography production design , which word , beautiful . story , which whilst not original , definitely very engaging . 1984 , fahrenheit 451 movies come mind , but they never this entertanining . make this 1984 this millennium , movie moves ultra slick pace matrix , but more deep rooted theme dystopia control worlds apart philosophies twists walchowski bros . way , it simple story , but simple stories told well acted well also profound long lasting . acting , i believe bale role his best . it not easy notice first he plays cold , ruthless cleric despatches resistance hardly blink . but his physical abilities fluid movements shows off bale capabilities action hero give keanu neo run his money . but what augments this immeasurably his ability act ... slowly emote over length film . catch scene where he awakes sunrise first time , able feel appreciate it even this simple act . emily watson short but very effective role woman who first instigate him think turning . their scenes not easiest , yet tension eventual connection they make through just looks slightest dialogue . sean bean always equally memorable his very brief role bale partner . round it up good performances taye diggs angus mcfadden this movie surpasses usual sci-fi stilted acting we so often bombarded . kurt wimmer , director also smart director . instead giving us cliches , he gives us situations which you might not necessarily expect , short but stunning fight sequences instead prolonged fights explosions/stunts which only hampers story pace . ultimately , it movie rewards subsequent viewings , may explain why this turned into such cult classic among its devoted followers , myself included . fan fiction fan videos already extended world libria pay homage movie its characters . while it may never reach dizzying heights matrix , it doesnt need . this film not masses , but those who really appreciate its intentions its strong visuals ( despite its lack budget ) eventually , theme behind it . kurt himself says , its more numbness towards everything how one man reacts it finds himself liberated simplest things we take granted . myself , i enjoy rewatching this only best sci-fi movies compel me so . it simply not just sci-fi cult classic , it geniune masterpiece genre rarely produces one	1
this film not only severely biased , but it fails explain why israel would deliberately attack their only ally . time friendly fire attack there huge explosion near el-arish where israel fighting egyptian troops . because israel attacked sea day earlier , they presumed egyptian warship firing them . us never even informed israel ship 22 miles off coast , it not even supposed there first place , joint chiefs staff repeatedly cabled liberty previous night instructions withdraw distance one hundred miles egyptian israeli coasts . short this film only matches venemous lies anti-semitic , anti-israel websites which preach hatred	-1

( read my entire opinion before deciding how much you like ' crimson ' -- after all , i give it 4 stars . dialogue way more important than most films this genre . ) i remember jean reno " professional " which i really liked , otherwise description crimson not enough convince me watch . i am glad i watch ! it very enjoyable film . description cover most reviews i've seen left me thinking this just long long list tales this genre . it -- then again it much more than . , there more than enough surpises keep even cynic like me interested . i watched it again right away -- , really , because ... movie far easier watch if you fluent french , which i am not . like all native english-speaking people , i find europeans speak lot faster than americans . crimson , actors speak very natural pace fine french . because it subtitled english , however , makes it impossible keep up because it also action movie so you need focus first action , yet there lot dialogue you need read -- dialogue no way superfluous . say , dialogue important . still , it very good movie , just aware you frequently reversing dvd pick up many things because there nuances surprise or three tucked there , which also good thing . example , near very beginning there something many viewers find very ' interesting ' -- though different people assign different things it -- but you'll reading subtitles , only catch hint it later deep movie , which means some point you may want go back ( it took me ' til very end movie realize i thought maybe there ' something ' scene then i went back , but even then i needed dialogue ' see ' what happening , i watch scene dozen times sure what i seeing . then again , you might very well ' get ' it right away ! lol but i doubt it)*much i enjoy movie i feel duty advise you translations used subtitles frequently not even close french spoken movie . very well-scripted film like crimson gets hobbled bit number poor translations . enjoy movie , allow some extra time doubling back pick up some very interesting things you didn't quite ' get ' .

lolita , based controversial novel vladimir nabokov , who wrote screenplay stanley kubrick , but kubrick disregarded it ( i read this wikipedia ) . read novel assignment college , i thought this movie going obscene novel ( without downplaying book , i mean only lustful utterances character humbert humbert ) . kubrick cleverly builds up sexual tension humbert humbert lolita , while charlotte haze blinded her mature age her need finding man herself , not pay attention evident lust humbert humbert her daughter , flirtings her precocious child . there big lesson this movie one humbert humbert fails pay attention : ' universe not revolve around you . ' when he realizes it , lolita already fled away after held secret affair quilty ( peter sellers ) , who turns out stalking , deceiving man , person much more dangerous than humbert humbert himself , one we thought sexual predator , but who , end story revealed just pathetic sick man . what could very nasty movie , surely cut , or even prohibited censors ( sexual situations just insinuated ) , instead drama seasoned comical overtones , like when motel , humbert humbert valet trying deploy collapsible bed , while lolita sleeps . sidenote , i wish stanley kubrick peter sellers could worked together more projects , peter sellers great both lolita dr. strangelove ; surely peters sellers best actors history cinematography . while novel , vladimir nabokov kills all ' sinners ' his story ( lolita dies during childbirth ) , here kubrick lolita , she survives . not scared away classification this movie art movie or cult classic , stanley kubrick didn't shoot his movies elite intellectuals , but all us who enjoy good story	1

while watching this film , i found myself irritated whining bickering goes , wondering how it could better . hanging up tells tale three sisters : meg ryan eve , bulwark family , runs her own business ; diane keaton georgia her own self titled magazine ; lisa kudrow matty , somewhat vapid soap opera actress . their elderly father ( walter matthau his last movie role ) memory problems , can't walk admitted hospital . he going die . ryan daughter who saddled responsibility her father , while other two too self-centered even care . all this could made compelling " dramedy " but director keaton allows over emoting all conflict override gentler side losing parent . matthau not all likeable either . cloris leachman brief appearance his ex-wife adam arkin ryan globetrotting husband . it surprising most honest moment film comes brief sequence ryan mother doctor whose car she crashed into hospital parking garage . ryan tries gamely hold movie together although she quite good , she can't really salvage film . keaton kudrow both adequate , but no depth observed . matthau more like matthau than true character it sad his last role so unlikeable . hanging up tries tackle sensitive real issues but it so contrived it fails	1

" but you need hear doug bradley delivery line it any affect you . line may look laughable , but it powerful so significant because it speaks volumes nature cenobites . it seems cenobites not slaughter someone who solves box unless person desire see what happens when box solved - even if person doesn't know what happen when box solved . would explain why they wanted torture kirsty first movie . since tiffany wanted solve box simply sake solving puzzle , she spared . she no idea anything would happen when she solved box . raises questions nature game - since cenobites obviously knew it channard who called them , why didn't they go after him ? or they think it kirsty who called them ? channard no qualms all when he people killed , yet he timid man . it clear he expects julia protect him whatever unknown terrors lurking hell . channard ultimately finds what he looking - pays painful price . there cenobite battle hellraiser ii , which disappointing because it so one-sided . there reason this though , case you don't get it when you watch movie , it explained audio commentary . dvd audio commentary ashley laurence , director tony randel writer peter atkins . their commentary very descriptive informative . they gently poke fun their mistakes , this makes commentary more enjoyable . lord knows there some glaring mistakes . but anyone besides me notice hostility seems exist randel atkins ? thought them sharing mutual dislike each other grudgingly doing this commentary together gives me perverse pleasure . i loved this movie up until kirsty reunion frank . point this movie goes hell ( manner speaking ) . it would nice if script dropped dumb subplot kirsty looking her father - even if left no reason kirsty character this movie . it near end movie when pinhead delivers his infamous line " your suffering legendary - even hell . " but even pinhead wit can't uplift last half hour this movie . but it pretty funny see patients tearing hospital apart - just how they get their hands all those puzzle boxes ? different actress plays female cenobite hellraiser ii - she less menacing this movie , but still entertaining . i glad see she still bloodlust so evident first movie . but i would preferred it if she didn't sound so nonchalant when she talking , i missed wide-eyed stare actress first movie . chatterer different face one point hellraiser ii , which confused me until i heard audio commentary . personally , i preferred chatterer original face . it real surprise when chatterer identity revealed . without giving away too much , it involves shocking scene - murder child . ending hellraiser ii made no sense whatsoever , but i'm guessing filmmakers wanted wait until sequel explain what going hell . yes , this writing i only seen first two movies hellraiser series . hellraiser ii also reveals pinhead background . needless say i disappointed - i preferred think cenobites lovecraftian origins . i even dreamed up whole history mythology cenobites after seeing first movie ! but i loved look dread despair pinhead face ( right before undergoing his `surgery ' ) toward end movie - you know if someone like him fearing his own safety then he must serious danger . how mighty fallen . buy soundtrack this dvd so you properly savour first two-thirds this movie	1

view askewniverse , you start wonder if any actors kevin smith movies manage break out characters they associated ( exception , course jason lee ben affleck ) . any jersey locals who act these films bankable career ? jay mewes started shed his " jay " character , but he going something better than " bottoms up . " i'd love see brian o'halloran something big well marilyn ghigliotti . jeff anderson , however , turns surprise not only acting gig , but writing directoral one well . it really good firs t-t ime outing guy who you feel got " railroaded " into acting world " clerks . " i almost hate compare this kevin smith flick , but anderson manages turn out romantic comedy par " chasing amy " but without world monologues kevin smith characters seem inhabit . don't get me wrong , kevin brilliant dialogue , but i imagine some viewers , they get lost all talking , witticisms , inside jokes . so flame me i dare blaspheme say anderson churned out something par ( or maybe slightly better than ) " chasing amy .

french way steamy films makes rest cinematic world seem bland comparison . nathalie fine case point . based idea philippe blasband transformed into superb screenplay jacques fieschi , fran�ois-olivier rousseau director anne fontaine , this incredibly well acted , subtle , understated film explores many facets adultery - woman point view . result suspenseful , erotic , intelligent film provides opportunity three france greatest actors demonstrate their credentials . catherine ( still very beautiful gifted fanny ardant ) gynecologist married successful bernard ( g�rard depardieu one his more subtle roles ) they stay-at-home hippy son ( rodolphe pauly ) who goes his life much same his parents : there superficial companionship but little depth relationship . marriage seems satisfactory until catherine suspects bernard affairs , fact bernard very honestly confesses : his eyes affairs sexual dalliances mean nothing . catherine shocked , attempts gain some support her insular but worldly mother ( fine judith magre ) who tells catherine it normal situation older marriages . catherine visits bar , private club consignations , there she meets marl�ne ( extraordinary emmanuelle b�art ) eventually buys marl�ne services prostitute meet her husband then tell her all encounters . it agreed marl�ne known ' nathalie ' . this point catherine nathalie meet after nathalie encounters bernard describes acts encounters vivid lurid detail . catherine fascinated continues pay nathalie going encounters subsequent voyeuristic descriptions . catherine even one-night stand her own bartender fran�ois ( wladimir yordanoff ) attempt understand her husband need infidelity . despite setup ' private investigator prostitute detective ' two women become friends . when catherine realizes she enough evidence against bernard leave him there final encounter three ( catherine , bernard , nathalie ) brings ingenious surprise ending - ending fine share it would spoil film viewers new story . ardant simply radiant catherine , playing role victim wife adulterous husband supreme dignity . likewise depardieu makes his bernard so understated profoundly honest conclusion retrospect should suspected . b�art once wholly physical her prostitute role yet maintains inner core confused woman keeps us her side she her job . production values all first rate ( except some ragged editing ) direction anne fontaine bristling intrigue wholly convincing her development this strange tale . despite dialogue x-rated there very little actual sex this film : makes it not only more powerful but ending revealed adds solidity story . french english subtitles . highly recommended art film lovers . grady harp , december 06	1
`lord flies ' made into movie least twice since william golding novel same name became cult classic / must read volume high school college students late 1950s . first version , which follows novel very closely , black white noted director , peter brook 1963 . second version color harry hook released 1990 . like many remakes same language , one immediately wonders why bother , original brook version more than gripping enough convey message novel . highlight differences two versions , let me outline story shared two versions . scene set when airplane carrying school children crashes south pacific , coast remote tropical island . approximately 30 children , ages 6 13 make it shore gather beach work out how they survive assume since they far removed their original destination island small uninhabited , there good chance it take long time , if ever , grown-ups find rescue them . first two principle characters ralph , one two or three oldest boys who we meet first , company intelligent , bespectacled , slightly overweight boy same age known `piggy ' . third main character jack , old fit ralph . three minor named characters simon , who prone fainting `seeing things ' sam eric , pair twins . early vote sets up ralph leader , few rules establishing conch shell found ralph piggy first reel symbol right speak gathering boys . jack immediately assumes responsibility leader `gang ' ( later become `tribe ' ) hunters who also take responsibility maintaining signal fire which ralph succeeds lighting using piggy eyeglass lens means concentrating sunlight clump tinder . jack gang gets involved too much hunting allows signal fire go out just aircraft flies near island . soon , story evolves presence monster island . this creates pretext jack split off group his tribe create camp more defensible location . this larger group becomes more more primitive , they raid ralph camp steal piggy specs since it only means they starting fires . placate monster , head killed wild pig cut its carcass stood top pole near suspected monster lair offering monster . after few days , simon observes this pig head its very large collection flies feasting festering flesh imagines he hears pigs head speak him , hence , source title . simon then killed when hunters mistake him night monster . when ralph piggy walk jack camp recover piggy specs , piggy killed `accident ' when jack tribe members pry large boulder loose falls piggy . ralph jack fight , ralph driven off , whole tribe sets fire jungle flush out ralph , presumably , kill him . both stories end ralph runs beach find himself feet very professionally uniformed member his country elite armed services . hook spices up dialogue making boys much more hip lots swear words references contemporary popular shows such alf miss piggy muppets . unfortunately , hook looses two most important elements whole story . beginning novel , subtly , beginning brook film , we see world once more war boys several different schools plane australia find relative safety coming ( nuclear ? ) conflict . hook shows nothing this , giving us simply group boys same military academy trip goodness knows where . this totally looses whole allegorical sense story where conflict boys mirrors war world large , especially sense last scene where world ( island ) destroyed conflict ( fire ) . second major oversight hook rendition there never enough attention given significance pig head , simon vision , sense `the lord flies ' . less important point origin monster myth different two movies . brook film follows book it misinterpretation billowing parachute fallen , dead pilot . hook creates myth out spasms downed plane delirious pilot he finds refuge cave rediscovered simon who believes he monster . both movies credible job depicting fall nominally civilized boys into savagery myth . combat ralph jack near end straight out frazier `the golden bough ' myth killing king . unfortunately , hook version seems eviscerated pig carcass , all great allegorical original story totally lost . , minimal they , i even think boys ' performances brook version better , their initial innocence face this loss civilization makes their transformation all more interesting . brook version highly recommended .	1

although some films here overlap some other early film dvds out there ( such edison set ' lumi�re brothers ' first films ' ) , there also some films here can't found anywhere else , it provides very nice introduction subject someone who just getting into these very early short films dawn motion pictures . categories include edison films , films lumi�re brothers , keystone short ( featuring charming mabel normand leading role ) , biograph short , max linder short , short french films , short documentary-style films , two very early film classics ' le voyage dans la lune ' ' great train robbery ' ( latter beautifully select hand-coloring ) . basically , it gives viewer good sampling various different types films made 1890s early teens . these very early films like literally looking back time , this bygone world , world where moving image so new revolutionary people didn't care movies only lasted under minute showed things like employees leaving factory or two babies quarreling , since they'd never seen these miraculously moving pictures before . it also opens short 1994 film ' homage eadweard muybridge , ' who invented zoopraxiscope , which projected series pictures way suggested movement . he one pioneers invention motion picture , even though here we're seeing series photography ( 1877-85 ) , not actual motion pictures . ( those who offended such things should aware woman these series photography " films " naked , times partially other times fully , though there absolutely nothing sexual or pornographic here ; it just series images woman who so happens not any clothes . ) my one complaint this disc ( other than mislabelling ' i.b. dam whole dam family ' ' whole dam family dam dog ' ) most films don't any dates given . even if one already familiar films this era instead new fan , it still nice them placed into historic context see years they all made . some bonus features also would nice , provided , say , some background films , people who made them , restoration process , what film-making like these very early days . it always nice supplemental information enjoy appreciate these antique films even more	1

first time i saw this movie - several years ago - i not very impressed . but now , today , it appeals me much more . i appreciate it upon 2nd or 3rd or 4th viewing . it definitely worth one collection . leslie caron fine little actress , her leading man very believeable filthy-rich , bored-with-life snob . until he tangles sweet , funny , gay , enchanting gigi . she softens him , falls love him , when she blossoms giddy schoolgirl into charming , alluring adult ( teen-ager ? ) , help her grandmother sophisticated aunt , his eyes opened , he definitely hooked , all ends well . " but it , you'll like it ! " i would given it 5-star rating but fact i thought there bit too much maurice chevalier i t.p.s. - it offer english subtitles . maybe french too , i don't remember .

" midnight marquee " series great idea , offering two old aip films one dvd , this one definitely worth , but primarily first film , " abominable dr. phibes . " " phibes " seems get better time . it stylish , classy horror film great cast , comic relief genuinely comic , grisly sense fun . price plays variation his " henry jarrod " character " house wax , " man grotesquely disfigured fire who hides himself behind more presentable mask sets out extract revenge those whom he believes wronged him . but he may even more demented . murders clever , if bit gross , but even so , we still manage root phibes . price quite wonderful unorthodox role ( character only speak artificially , which meant all his lines post-recorded ) deco trappings very attractive . since resolution left open-ended , sequel almost inevitable . " dr. phibes rises again " adequate follow-up , but falls several notches below original . it almost though everyone going through motions because inevitability sequel , but their hearts aren't it . everyone except co-star robert quarry , who takes things quite seriously . result , he very effective dorian gray-ish type part , but he also comes off though he not really joke . nowhere near stylish , or even logical , " dr. phibes rises again " still its moments -- bumbling policemen lot fun -- but it remains something disappointment	1

all i say , wow ! blame it my watched dallesandro movies " reverse " - viewed blood dracula flesh frankenstein , i prepared stone-faced portrayal dallesandro ... perpetual sneer worn over rigid , blank expression dallesandro " trademark " both films . instead i blown away fresh faced boy , beautiful smile , expressive face dancing eyes . wow ! this film must any dallesandro fan . quality film grainy , sound equally grainy little jumpy- but once you get used these deficiencies , you quickly get caught up story . i use term " story " loosely since , what i understand , entire thing shot without script - allowing actors simply ad-lib . it may , story line unfolds fascinating manner . once again , i disappointed find no commentary or interview dallesandro included special features . instead you get commentary morrrissey that only slightly interesting . i highly question his assertion he making some grand statement this movie . i think now , he wants looks back history pull grand statement , what then , only meant entertainment . but then i've always found morrissey little egotistical . ( besides which , i think morrissey should kicked turning dallesandro into stone-faced actor who wasn't allowed smile . ) people should know while this no means pornography , graphic male nudity makes this unsuitable young viewers .	1

though he long admired his rigorous almost ritualistic approach filmmaking , while he created number unforgettable narrative films , it likely herzog remembered his unique approach documentary . fact , hindsight , what appeals most his narrative films documentary elements -- where reality interjects itself . consider heart glass , example : narrative interesting but obscure , but what stunning document entire crew non-actors , ordinary villagers , who submitted filmed under hypnosis . or take stroszek . it very interesting story dream america represents some europeans , violence loneliness relationships , but what makes it unforgettable scene towards end live chickens who trained take part very bizarre set performances roadside attraction , way this real element comments narrative . this even more true fitzcarraldo ( whose making documented this film ) , where insane ambition main character -- bring opera natives -- manner realizing this -- dragging massive boat over mountain order make fortune accessing remote rubber trees -- where portrayal this insane ambition character made much more powerful realization it actually filmmakers . given , it fitting herzog himself should documented , since his large life lives he captures his films . here he documented process making film man who monumental but bizarre dreams achieves them ; course process making film mirrors its subject . one my favorite scenes film herzog rejecting vigorously idea " nature beautiful " yet insisting its ugliness , fecund horror nature , precisely what he loves it ( spite his better judgment ) . hier ist ein autentischer mensch ! reviewer compared this film unfavorably hearts darkness . it true there aren't many " oh my god i can't believe ... " type moments this film -- but part because coppola it over his head just barely made it through alive sane ( course two stunning films show it : apocalypse now his wife document his own descent ) . what we see this film just such insane scenario herzog not over his head because he precisely his element . ( still , i wish somebody would give criterion type treatment " hearts darkness " " apocalypse now " : imagine dvd set both versions apocalypse now " hearts darkness " special feature ! ) some great extras come criterion set , including wonderful fitting little documentary ( especially errol morris fans ) called " werner herzog eats his shoe " which herzog fulfills promise errol morris , well , eating his shoe .	1

this film took me back time age 15 when only thing mattered how many friends you , how popular you , your status social pecking order . high school society most meaningless , inane , irrational , unproductive place world one . it almost better dead than go school every day , point agnes evidently concurred ( uh , no , she doesn't die ) ... this messed-up decadent reality modern world , where youth idle , nothing their time except obsess over shallow , hurtful social war-games . our society not engage young people helping solve today problems ; so , many problems ( like lost our manufacturing u.s.a. , or our export jobs careers , demise american middle class , environment ) simply not get fixed , people grow up callous uninterested solving social problems . this film indicts entire system education , which needs overturned revised ... i call two main characters " real " girls , contrast other girls this film , who not real , but phony , obsessed playing game getting into other people business . i not idealize lesbians particular , but extent they real willing buck social system themselves , they highly admirable . these two girls different personalities each other , it would really interesting see how their relationship progressed over time . but this movie first love ( lesbian ) , only involves initial stage , somewhere rejection acceptance . i won't tell you how movie ends , but it very moving highly recommended . i really feel agnes	1

ok , i'm only writing this because i wound up popping this dvd into my player last night watching it again . i bought this movie years ago after first seeing it laughing like imbecile pretty much throughout . yes , it sick humor . no , it not everyone . but this tom green ! i can't imagine what some people who reviewed this movie expecting - citizen kane ? c'mon people ! there precious little plot - just enough each tom green site gag or gross out gag , which basically what tom green known . letting him direct this film , i can't imagine what people thought they'd see ? most people i know not like this film , close friend mine still make fun me liking it , if i ever bring up title , but so what ? if lowbrow humor , sight gags gross out scenes make you chuckle , this film you . also , great acting , usual , rip torn - he hysterical . just remind yourself it tom green vehicle , you're only watching it lowbrow humor , you'll fine . if you sit down watch major movie production , yes , you'll disappointed but i don't think even close aim this movie . still ridiculously funny after all these years . baby scene , " backwards man " scene , sausage scene absolutely inane , yet priceless	1
black christmas not effective halloween . killer annoying , some gurgling lunatic who uses obscene language get his point across . direction editing weak . how many times we see woman wrapped cellophane up attic ... she dead .. i get it ... move ! i wasnt routing characters or killer matter ... this movie just didnt deliver . halloween when stranger calls " borrowed " this film both movies scarier	1
i went see " touch zen " late seventies new york film festival . all seriousness it my greatest moviegoing experience all my years moviegoer . i guess it because whenever i saw classic film like " citizen kane " or " bicycle thief " or " godfather " or whatever , i prepared see something great . but i totally unprepared this . i never seen anything like it before . when hsu feng suddenly revealed her ability fight this awe-inspired power grace -- not mention bound like gazelle -- it hit me all beauty magic what movies . it knocked me out see woman warrior like this . since then course i've seen many films like this . " crouching tiger " quotes many films , but ang lee james schamus fans this one . but there also " matrix " ( shot where hsu feng revealed ceiling over door ) course , " house flying daggers " - scene bamboo forest totally ripped off film . course , countless hong kong films . this bible . i also believe painstaking beauty it leone-like compositions , it influenced new generation filmmakers like zhang yimou . other directors king hu time made four films year . he spent three years this . but thing remember " touch zen " completely before cgi . course there lot old-fashioned cinema trickery , but much it just plain old acrobatics . so i little afraid see what i would think it decades later . what made first time work how unexpected it . anyway , i popped copy , just check out how bad copy . i ended up watching whole three hours , finishing two am . i've seen so many other films like this since , but it still bes t.t he copy just like ones you see restoration videos , when they show you how brilliant color faded there all these scratches , etc . there version this film comes different company , it available amazon . uk , but you would need all-region player , which course illegal . it might end up same print anyway . there version i've seen cinflix.com no subtitles . one final note , i actually met king hu hollywood backlot eighties . he trying make hollywood film producers midge sanford sarah pillsbury ( " desperately seeking susan " ) i guess he little too early . i'm sure there would place him now , but he passed years ago	1
i ordered this item 3 months ago nevered got it !	-1

i just bought this dvd today i thought it good . not great . donald pleasence always good each films . without jamie or donald , they would no movie . this 4th movie tell jamie , daughter laurie , who , this movie , ' dead ' . michael alive escaped once again . now after jamie , he returns haddonfield . dr. loomis also survived fire , now cane , he little slower than he 10 years ago . dvd presentation film best you find anywhere . extras also really good . i no idea dwight little , director , so skinny . i thought him fat , horror geek director . if you liked first 2 halloweens , than this you . ps : skip halloween iii all together	1
don't let this movie running time ( 325 minutes ; almost 4 hours ) , fact it not english , or it cricket , put off any potential viewers . this not action film , nor it high-suspense thriller . it doesn't any special effects , no blood , no gore . yet some reason , story catches you up you find yourself caring what happens . personally , i found four hours whizzed . i don't know more than couple words hindi , so i can't say how accurate subtitles , but they certainly good enough me informed . i especially appreciated subtitles musical numbers , which you rarely find . american , i find cricket rather mysterious . so i didn't understand finer details cricket match , but i definately got wrapped up tension suspense , even if i didn't know why . which , if you think it , good reccomendation ! acting great ; aamir khan very charismatic , intense , down right handsome . i appreciated gracy singh acting well ; she could really camped up her jealousy scenes , but instead came off adorable ; how could bhuvan ( kahn ) not love her ? i wonder how long it took british actors learn their hindi lines , or if they doing them phonetically . i digress . if you even passing interest india , indian history , bollywood style movies , or even peculiar game called cricket , then you enjoy this film immensely	1

there aren't many cases where movie better than book , but " goodbye mr. chips " one them . james hilton tossed together his barely over 100 pages big type week . scriptwriters film fleshed out good story line much more detail . well-directed just superbly acted robert donat title role , this film endearing classic . basic story traditional english schoolmaster , set period mid-victorian pre-wwii . it gentle tale meaning man life how we rise excellence our modest professions touch lives many . mr. chipping ( " chips " his students affectionately know him ) leads rich life , although also fraught sorrows . there still much relevance film -- tragedy war , importance balanced education , evils caste . yes , film sentimental little manipulative , but you probably not mind . fact , you may cry your eyes out . compared r.f. delderfield " serve them all my days , " book " chips " not nearly good , but this film tops bbc mini-series " days " virtually every way -- especially managing leave out lot class warfare ! order it , go buy box puffs , plonk yourself down delightful classic	1
this documentary written , directed edited ray greene features clips independent movies made 1950s 1960s height ( relatively speaking ) exploitation movies united states . clips , " schlock ! secret history american movies " interviews people who made these movies . you should recognize least some what whizzes here ( e.g. , " nude moon , " " carnival soul "" ) if you any familiarity genre you recognize lots names . just disappointed when one these movies catches your fancy then you discover it not available video or dvd . this 2001 documentary begins asking , " what exploitation movie ? " easy answer not forthcoming , but you certainly understand evolution genre over quarter-century which it thrived . greene finds genesis exploitation discovery teenagers comprised economic market distinct rather broad category " children . " i am not sure if i would privilege arrival vampira scene highly greene , but you admit she makes pretty good poster girl movies under discussion . actually , youth oriented films ( e.g. , " i teenage werewolf " ) get rather short shift " part i : fast furious , " although it introduce roger corman work a.i.p. explores idea there examples exploitation films might actually meaningful ( not their creators aware such depth ) . there also emphasis idea exploitation movies it how you sell these things matters more than whether or not they any good ( because they usually not ) . court rulings obscenity set up " part ii : sinema , " which most interesting part documentary because greene shows how industry got sex films dealing miracle birth " hygiene " issues , nudist camp films doris wishman , nudie cuties films harry novak . once exploitation films go " across great divide " part iii , we get emphasis blood gore impact sexploitation films we get what called roughies . so if you not interested sexploitation you going disappointed " schlock ! " because this where greene able make his best academic arguments . really . you only look so many naked women greene analysis interview clips wishman novak lot more interesting . final section returns corman see what he up 1960s looks how what happening end decade ratings system " midnight cowboy " ended up sounding death knell exploitation flicks . concluding argument today all movies examples exploitation , during end credits while we watch people walk poster " godzilla " ( " size matter " ) , which reinforces idea today all movies " exploitation " definition . it interesting see these filmmakers point out today movies their best days weeks when they open , which trademark exploitation films their heyday , versus way movies major studios would build momentum over time . terms dvd extra we begin behind scenes footage sexploiters harry novak ( takes us tour his office ) , dorish wishman ( interview outtakes ) , david . friedman ( demonstrating typical " sex hygiene " book pitch ) . then greene talks " sci-fi : science symbols " short clip television documentary we short , " atom eve , " surreal industrial film early 1960s produced connecticut yankee atomic power company , which uses buxom dancer leslie franzos sell nuclear power ( greene wryly notes card introducing this one , " obscenity eye beholder " ) . audio extras there kpcc radio interview greene , songs " your one only original lizard brain " " under rug , " latter johnny english , who wrote soundtrack music liked it enough add lyrics make it song . matter , you listen entire soundtrack . there exploitation art gallery ( most which pops up documentary ) , credits filmmakers also credits talking heads forrest . ackerman doris wishman ( which samuel . arkoff , peter bogdanovich , roger corman maila nurmi a.k.a. vampira ) . you also find audio commentary track greene , co-producer wade major special guests really continue explore topics broached documentary	1
this excellent dvd video collection . very good picture quality sounds . worth purchase it . not think twice	1
here italian cannibal movie i continue find there isn't much exciting this genre . again , we mostly controversy over killing animals which i really don't find either disturbing or entertaining all . i am also little bored seeing kerman movie . there really one scene where they could taken movie ' too far ' but they held back . i hoping they would take things too far .	1
i think biggest problem this movie people think they're supposed take it seriously . ummmm , no . it satirical comedy , not straight comedy . all indignant people who pan this movie saying it stupid taking it way too seriously . course it stupid , it satire . ( warning , some minor spoilers , but they don't matter much ) i mean , love interest nun , he mails himself vatican , he spends whole movie trying get cup capuccino his parole officer tries get him commit crime . think da vinci code meets laurel hardy .	1
jackie chan great even wild-wes t.t his movie just plain fun ! exactly what it meant ... not true western , not hilarious comedy , just plain fun	1
you know , this movie great . it some performances die , some most awkward dry humor out there , simultaneously hilariously funny deeply disturbing , relatable characters one either recognize or realize chillingly exist right next door ... or sometimes your very own house . it really great movie , especially utilizing todd solontz ' particular brand suburbia mentality . it just he didn't know where stop . mostly his relationships this film great , going surprising directions ultimately very telling type person he trying create . but honestly , we even need any side-story parents ? every time we got back them i got distinct feeling this five , ten , fifteen minutes i'd not watching other , better , more interesting characters develop . also , fat lady neighbor ; ultimately , her story came out end became worth it , but it most predictable least tightly defined all characters . i think todd solontz got little into " big cast " syndrome ( without actually hugely recognizable cast , save hoffman boyle ) express much widespread loneliness possible , but didn't think how much may weigh down otherwise biting in-your-face social commentary . it great movie , but it could even better . -- polarisdi	1
judging number reviews ( now 44 ) amazon , this 1943 western masterwork must relatively unknown . directed william wellman , starring henry fonda , dana andrews henry morgan , this tale mob ( posse ) rule frontier " justice " timeless , , unforgettable . film actually ensemble piece many fine performances . it should mentioned wellman cast black man prominent role preacher , which little unsual early 1940s . filmed bland silvery black white , absent here desolute beauty arizona desert or majesty colorado mountains , it appears movie made entirely studio backlot constructed sets . its great sense enclosure instrumental stark reality film inevitable conclusion . there very little action type normally associated westerns , but storyline so precise convincingly executed it moves quickly , almost too much so . say much more film content would giving too much away . film nominated academy award best picture wellman directed other great films , my favorite ( other than this one ) " battleground , " u.s. army struggle hold bastogne during battle bulge . " ox-bow incident " top my favorite westerns should staple any serious collector library	1

i'm not sure what i'm supposed expecting " classic eploitation/revenge " film , but if this it i'd say genre died just death . many reviewers pointed out , there simply fatal problems this film . sex scenes utterly awful , like they instructional film . christina lindberg beautiful , but don't expect any thrills her outside some decent lesbian scenes . lack music sound create claustrophobic feel , but this kind film i never tell if that intentional or just result piss-poor production values . " action " scenes almost all slow-motion which simply too slow robs scenes any sense real violence . i don't know why people go this kind movie . i think tarentino some sort complex : he feels guilty using kind production values he , while movies he grew up looked sounded like this one . he should get over it though , there nothing wrong movie looks sounds good , doesn't make you feel akward while you watch it . there little " rough " or " shocking " this movie , its just not very well . it interesting period piece , its cool i limited edition ( though it not numbered other reviewers pointed out ) , don't think this investment though , few more years , no one going care ...	1
item shipped quickly perfect , brand new condition . thanks	1
i must say i'm shocked this film overlooked when it came big awards . why oscar voters hate love so much ? it because they're all shallow phonies out touch real human emotion ? i think we all know answer those questions , right ? heck , i don't go around calling people names feeling good it . but when film this caliber called " drivel " one critic " horse manure " . it sort gets my goat , you see where i'm going this ? thing , just because something happy ending doesn't mean it not artistic success , understood ? i could write all day how real art needs reflect life honest miserableness life , but who wants read realistic views like , you follow ? anyway , redford really phones great performance michelle . radiant tv reporter mad skills questionable attitude .	1

comedy bitter sweet edge , " purple rose cario " fairly simple premise . cecilia ( mia farrow ) struggles make ends meet during great depression . her husband monk ( danny aiello)is lout who cheats her gambles since losing his job cecilia work restaurant take laundry meet their bills rent . only escape cecilia going movies -- fantasy world hollywood gives her coccoon brutal real world . her favorite movie " purple rose cario " featuring gil shepard ( jeff daniels ) tom baxter ( also jeff daniels dual role)changes her life when character tom baxter walks out movie into real world . he says he love her wants her happy something no one else except cecilia sister cares . rest characters film ( edward herrman , milo o'shea , deboarh rush , zoe caldwell , john wood , van johnson)are pretty upset end up sparing audience watching them screen when they complain how boring movie . " purple rose " one allen most complete films captures all wistfulness lurks background his films . this dvd looks extremely good considering transfer 2001 . there some minor artifacting particularly when characters move quickly screen but , whole , it not big deal . allen hasn't commentary tracks allowed extras his releases which too bad there cut footage viggo mortensen michael keaton ( who originally cast lead instead daniels)that would interest . i don't know if footage still exists but if it it would make lovely addition this . why mgm didn't choose include archieved footage allen talking film new interviews stars beyond me . this oscar nominated ( best screenplay)film certainly deserves documentary its making or , very least , featurette . we get original theatrical trailer booklet discusses making film . great movie hopefully get better treatment when it ends up blu-ray format , " purple rose " still treat well worth picking up . it also priced well $12-14 most retail outlets amazon.com	1

i love navy movies like this because i grew up hearing my grandfather stories life navy during ww2 . james caan plays sailor who required leave his ship because minor medical problem . because missing paperwork , however , he forced remain shore his beloved ship departs its latest voyage . although he stuck shore , he makes most his situation heads nearest bar!it bar he spots sexy marsha hunt , who known her sexual exploits sailors . after he hustles her pool game , they both leave bar head her apartment where he " collects " his payment ( you know what i mean ! ) . while there he discovers she young son ( kirk calloway ) who major attitude problem . despite boy attitude , caan starts spending more more his free time trying earn boy trust . he also realizes he falling love hunt . despite her initial protests , he tries his best help her change her lifestyle become better parent her troubled child ( who drinks alcohol chews tobacco ) . learning hunt pregnant man , caan bravely chooses marry her so she'll supported his navy benefits . her baby dies shortly after death , however , her depression drives them apart . caan must then choose returning navy or trying patch up their relationship . i won't spoil ending , although i must say i thought it rather unconvincing . i don't know why this called comedy video jacket , although there humorous scenes . some best scenes involve caan his former drill instructor ( eli wallach ) . way , i surprised discover glenn buttkus ( " sailor ward " ) small role this movie . if i'm not mistaken , that same glenn buttkus who fabulous movie lists amazon.com! while this movie isn't quite good " last detail " , i still highly recommend it .	1

whoever wrote editorial review sucks writing . also , this movie sucks	1
i gave two stars this movie exactly two benefits i gained watching it . these benefits illustrated next two paragraphs . there absolutely beautiful cinematography . depictions provence , region france adjacent both mediterranean sea italy , bountiful beautiful . director ridley scott showcasing scenes representing provence enough make one consider clicking " complete order " button 14-day european vacation extravaganza . catchy little tune alizee , " moi lolita " , made brief appearance movie which catapulted song back into my consciousness . song , course , one many attempts media capitalize cultural sensation vladimir nabokov controversial novel , " lolita " , but story entirely . * plot summation information below*the essence story tired clich� greedy , amoral pig finding meaning , love , purpose via simple equation : abandoned family estate + attractive native love interest + beautiful french countryside = happiness . max ( russell crowe ) wildly successful but unscrupulous power broker , who never met market he didn't want manipulate . following particularly successful business adventure , his assistant clues him possibility he risk investigated trade regulatory commission . partial solution , she his superiors recommend he take temporary leave absence company , preferably out country , until heat dies down . luck would it , max uncle recently died provence , since he left no , winery previously under his care automatically bequeathed max , he closest known relative . * end plot summation information*many complained sheer predictability plot , definitely negative aspect this film , but not necessarily terminal one . what kill my enjoyment film utterly nonsensical editing . scenes flash without any semblance explanation . cut conversation , seemingly no reason all , explain nothing , then cut next scene just one beginning soak up scenery . include several characters scenes without any actual suggested or implied reason their placement there . speed up action one or two semi-montage scenes vein physical-comedy film , no pre- or post-scene comedic introduction or resolution . finally , splice post- " fin " scene which could only described surreal . essence , this movie 200 mini-films spliced into one . least , that impression i got , it totally destroyed my suspension disbelief . there other negatives : lame stereotyping ( secretaries , americans , european humor ) , plots go nowhere ( " good " / " bad " wine secret " conspiracy " ) , humor attempts which only labeled " wince-inducing " , among many , many other detrimental attributes . not even worth renting , unless your friend already rented it , you cleaned all gunk you could reasonably expected clean out your fingernails already . romantic comedy lovers : this neither romantic nor funny , so if you just see handsome russell crowe or beautiful marion cotillard , buy poster instead . " gladiator " or " black hawk down " fans : no , even breakneck editing , it still not action movie . scenery fans : turn off audio , fast-forward " scenery " scenes , keep semillon flowing ... i would recommend three bottles per person	1
this one my favorite thriller/suspense category . if you fan this type movie , then this must . it keep you edge your seat , you not want pause this one	1
director anthony mann star james stewart made great combination . i always found their westerns together reached part me other westerns didn't reach . bend river , winchester ' 73 etc , this top-notch stuff , not necessarily heavy action , but lot hear t.t he rest really great cast includes donald crisp , arthur kennedy aline macmahon	1
i bought this movie because i remembered it fondly when i 14 year old teenage girl back 1978 . my husband never seen it we couldn't find copy video store . i told my 15 year old daughter it since she big fan beatles , she interested seeing it well . when i received dvd , i sort cringed how cheesy movie . peter frampton barry gibb looked like hotties i remembered when i 14 , but movie whole pretty campy . before viewing movie , i concerned my daughter watching it , i remembered scene where band all getting drunk stoned , but compared what kids watch nowadays , or see myspace , it pretty tame . not surprisingly , though , my 15 year old daughter loved it . she plays it all time her friends over watch . she asked me who sings " come together " i told her it steven tyler band aerosmith . she thinks he hot ! i broke news her he 30 years older now . she still loves movie . i purchased soundtrack well . this movie album my first exposure many beatle songs i never heard kid . it made me want go out there hear original songs . some them , i like beatles version better , but i fell love peter frampton version " golden slumbers . " this movie great trip down memory lane me	1
