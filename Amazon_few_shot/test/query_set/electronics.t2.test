i bought this card my tj25 , supposedly supported device . but problems this card make it nearly useless : - it comes web browser doesn't work . - even if browser work , it would only work 30 days before you buy full version . - only downloadable browser works card eudora , which doesn't anything except display text ( you can't even fill web forms it , so webmail , searches , etc . impossible ) . - card designed work netfront clie mail , software comes internet-enabled clie devices ... obviously not what you would if you buying card . these programs not available separately . - card wouldn't connect either my wireless network or neighbors ' , even though my powerbook no trouble connecting either , no additional configuration required . - while attempting connect , card would often stop responding , then lock up handheld . bottom line : if you want web-enabled pda , buy web-enabled pda . don't buy this	-1
minor problem user manual claims user id " admin " . well , it not . frustration wasted time occur until you somehow find out user id should left blank log . major problem unit only works twelve 36 hours before it rebooted . after twelve 36 hours it looses connection wireless network . once you unplug plug back power cord , it work fine twelve 36 hours . i am used rebooting windows every time it hangs , but i don't accept wireless access point hangs ( i am not sure how microsoft able convince me it ok os hang ) . this box going back . i already bought buffalo works fine	-1

once again i'm amazed how reviews so highly favor this product . these terribly uncomfortable ( my ears ) don't really provide great listening experience . frequency response seems muted until you use largest possible " surrounds " , then they become distractingly uncomfortable . but course , this just my experience , your mileage may vary , they say . personally , i found my apple ipod ' phones better	1
i this printer more than year . first , it great printer . not anymore !! it uses up ink like no other , yes , it great individual tanks(which why i bought thing ) but now print head isn't working right . several deep cleanings use up nearly all full tanks up , problem still there . pages splotchy black marks texts only partially printed . went canon website , they don't even acknowledge this printer ever existed . my recommendation don't buy this model !!	-1

just received radio yesterday , am returning radio today ! pluses .... adequate lcd display good illumination while ac adapter . good thumbwheel tuning 1 khz increments . adequate speaker fidelity small radio . however , volume slew buttons set " numbered " volume levels , settings 5-6 , there big noticeable increase volume(not good ) , while tuning shortwave bands , every approx 100khz increment , there appears " null " area , where signal meter reads signal received , but quiet speaker . also , fm , if hands near radio , signal breaks up(for weaker signals , not strong ones ) , compared my grundig 400-pe , which i feel sensitivity not good hiss bothersome , eton e-5 seems worse still !!! i am returning this today , obtaining sony 7600gr instead . eton e-5 , not bad , but certainly not worth 3 stars or above , especially , if comparing it similar size radio , then comparing it my sony 2010 .	1

" change sensitivity " button strange spot ( least if u large hands ) located center mouse where you need reach far back almost touch pad your palm finger you're reaching - not efficient movement , therefore not applicable games ( you assign sensitivity script perhaps one side mouse buttons if necessary ) . these only minor itches when compared outstanding precision i would highly recommend it	1

i wanted simple printer so i could print few prints time time hand out . sale $50 , this seemed like right one . i already included zoombrowser photo stitch software installed my prior purchase canon a95 camera , so i just needed install driver . note this requires usb cable ( not included ) printer . human nature , i tried print without reading zoombrowser instructions , got lovely plain sky-blue print words " my album " it - but no photo :-) then , out came stunning second print which totally blank but some faint horizontal lines - this residual click my first attempt . ok , ok , so i looked pdf printing guide 15 seconds , followed instructions . got beautiful first print queen mary ship . got gorgeous second print flags ( red/white/blue , green ) againt clear blue sky , third print very nice field flowers near mt lassen ( ironically original proof print this 20 years ago scanned onto my computer just today get rid paper prints ... ) so , i've blown through provided " trial " 5 sheets paper film cartridge , 3 very nice prints ( postcard address lines , stamp area canon logo back - paper comes way . ) ends paper remain white but perforations 1/2 inch end so you remove them after printing . i can't compare printing software any other brand , but setting up plain phot o-o nly print takes 10 seconds menu choices . if you want add backgounds , titles/text , etc , available well . ( got pack paper/film , put humorous captions kind funny-bad office christmas pix ... ) printing directly my a95 takes same time computer - 1 min 45 sec . actual operation involves paper passed out printer 4 times ( 3 color passes protective layer ) so it important back printer not obstructed , particularly power cord which hangs down near edge slot . finished print deposited top paper cassette front . unit looks feels substantial its small size , comes well packed ( survived ny ca shipping ) , decent documentation , 1-year warranty .	1

i gave my son garmin 60c christmas last year . tinkered it couple days before handing it over . it worked well . course i wanted one myself , but cash cash , so i've putting it off . ( side note - i wanted borrow it trip this past spring , when they went get it , it stolen their car map-pocket . it seems these high-theft items ; keep'em short leash . ) my wife hadn't gotten me any " big " christmas gift , so i told her i knew what i wanted , started shopping . i debated explorist 500 600 . chose 600 , its altimeter thermometer . probably could lived without them , but hey , it christmas ! it came yesterday , so i charged it bit , then it no trouble finding 4 satellites under my deciduous tree cover . i go out street garmin find satellites . took it out spin today . spot-on navigation i ran errands . it tracked back almost exact spot i marked home , though it me driving down wrong side street portion my route duplicate - so it off few feet . ( maybe it still thinks it britain ? )now - why only 4 stars ? 1 ) usb connector attach unit either way . there no instructions anywhere say which way it should go . i called 800 # spoke someone ( new delhi ) who heard this lot . she told me what , pc immediately recognized gps file system - removable disk drive , advertised . i really find their website information near-zero . something elementary this should covered website after 3rd call , eh ? 2 ) i bought mapsend 3d topo software . i am interested elevations . it detailed street maps . but - they're not routable ! if you want routable streets ( where unit route you streets not just crow flight direct path ) following car , then either you get both map products , or choose . it rather frustrating . sales information provided amazon magellan sites not make this critical lack very clear . it tells you what you , but not what you can't there no product comparison see what differences . mapsend topo box , it says very clearly , " navteq roads streets data - like found most expensive car navigation systems ( non-routable ) " . er , excuse me , then it not quite like found expensive car systems , it ? i concur other reviewers who find software selection verbiage ( amazon magellan ) more obfuscating than informative . why can't someone create simple comparison chart all various map packages	1

when i got my hands pmc-120 i thought this going best player but when i started play it all glitches started come into my way . i agree other reviews it first generation-device feel it . music : when i tried put music my pmc it syncronized my mp3s wmp 10 no problem ( very fast ) . if u looking grab drop ( copy/paste ) your music mp3 device , this not you because when i it got everything one same folder read " unknown artist album " . so you put all your mp3s via wmp 10 , wich no problem me because it it very fast . problems i encountered it only one " portable playlist " sometimes when im playing mp3 navegating through other albums controls respond 1 2 seconds later after pushing button . one cool thing it shows cd covers without put them . this via wmp10 . sound very good crisp , equalizer setups fair . but you defenetly cant tell difference diffrent eq setups built speacker wich very small horrible sound . pictures : this basically grab drop procedure get your pics device you arrenge them folders or subfolders . you not transfer directly your camera so if you travelling dont pc transfer your pics this little baby wont job you . video : ok , now this where it starts get frustrating me ... i wanted portable media device i would only grab drop my movies divx xvid . i knew this device only reads wmv but it " supports " divx , xvid , mpeg , etc . this " support " deppends what wmp10 play . so this means you sincronyze ( via wmp10 ) your movies no matter format it converts them into wmp movies same time it just transferes it fits it into your pmc secreen size . i this mind when i bought it fine me untill i tried it first time : wmp10 wouldnt convert my xvid movies after few hours trial error surfing web my problem i correct video codecs compatibles wmp10 . so after uninstalling installing i good go so i converted 1:45 hr long movie only 25 minutes . but this short moment joy suddenly interrupted fact wmp10 fits widescreen movies into pmc makes all images long thin almost unwatchable !!!! you cant change this because wmp this automatically . my answer using other software converting my widescreen movies into wmv files . problem it takes almost running time movies convert ... i tried lot different softwares still havent found one it faster wmp10 . other hand if you full screen video you just use wmp10 it it very fast good quality . you connect your device tv but resolution very low so i think this option useless pmc . so veredict : pmc-120 good multimedia player minor glitches . it little bulky but personally i think size not big . i think good side size issue comes its big 3.6 inch screen wich great watch films this me kicks arse compared ipod video . if you want play directly your divx or xvid movies your player buy porduct like iriver pmp series or archos players wich way , way , way more expensive . so i think price what it pmc-120 gets two thumbs up .	1
very good player very reasonable price .	1

when i paid somewhere $20-$30 couple months ago optifix pro kit , i made wrongful assumption high price tag would entail good craftsmanship contrast some cheaper radial cleaners i've owned before . package description made it seem promising enough i've mostly good experiences memorex past , so i just put it test immediately after taking product home . after reading instruction guide carefully before use , i'm positive product used properly , but unfortunately , optifix pro just couldn't deliver goods . fact , not only could it nothing restore any discs i inserted , it worsened scratches it supposed repair ! what more frustrating - two discs it served further damage out print therefore irreplacable . i hope fellow cd collectors sympathize my message steer clear this particular memorex product	-1
appearances description , this appears identical my sddr-92 ( no a15 ) except shape button . this sandisk excellent unit - compact reasonably slim , detachable usb cord . it perfect carrying pocket your laptop case ( unlike my dazzle which fine desk top , but awkwardly shaped compact storage ) . unit reliable fast , , unlike 8-in-1 or 12-in-1 units which use up four hard-drive letters , this unit only uses one hard-drive letter . it supports reading , writing , deleting , etc ., works either usb 2.0 or usb 1.1 . if you not care button software , this unit installs plug-n-play , without needing driver cd ( least win 2000 xp ) . it simply appears removable hard-drive letter explorer . i not install button software because i am not fan extra transfer mechanisms photo organizers my computer . i would rather full , manual control how when things happen , where files put . i think this 5-star unit , but i downgrade my own unit 4 1/2 stars because its overzealous packaging arrogant installation instructions . both instructions , sticky label unit ( which i still not able fully remove ) , it proclaims you must install button software before connecting unit . i ignored warning , unit worked fine without any installation needed . one important requirements card reader portability . since not everyone takes kindly your installing software their computer , card must able work just plugging it into usb port . sandisk sddr-92 meets this requirement , although it proclaims not . this good choice compactflash reader/writer .	1

i bought nulooq product few weeks ago little expectation actually some doubts it'd anything me , i'm keyboard junkie . product description bit confusing it seems like ti lot . but what surprise . just adjusting brush size using ipod like scroll disc device worth price . pop-up menu thing cool . i don't use it much putting tools , but putting my files folders into menu keeps things one place . i guess product also lets you pan zoom around , but i don't seem use much . i still like using my mouse pan zoom around . hey , i skeptical product like anyone else , but found myself rare surprise . good job logitech	1

this review pertains specifically targus pauh217u 4 port ultra mini usb 2.0 hub . cord 2.5 feet long - long enough reach my pc , which sits ground , top desk . it cable which split into two usb plugs - one just transmit data , second power unit . second plug not need used unless you plan using some heavy-duty hardware , if so what you buying hub called ultra mini anyways ? if you insist trying run blow dryer off thing , then it input separate power source , which you buy separately . short , if you old school machine usb ports which inaccessible /inconvenient use , this little hub give you quick access while taking up minimal space your desk	1

i noticed there several reviews various products here , but this review panasonic dmr-es10s ( silver ) . i am not technological wizard impatient , so my husband set this up me . i've it 5 months now love it . this tv upstairs . i bought it because i trouble our old rca dvd recorder ( unreliable ) , but that review . once setup it complete , unit very easy use . i read lots reviews before buying realized cons others not concern me , i.e. we don't hdtv yet so 16:9 ratio not important . all i needed something record things my tivo unit dvr could record multiple dvd formats ( dvd-r , +r , dvd ram , etc . ) . featues i like : i like ample space unit allows actually typing name show ( unlike rca which only let you few characters ) . i really use flexible recording feature exactly fit movie or fit lots shows . i play around this feature figure out how work it while recording multiple shows one disk ( manual wasn't useful part ) , but i use it all time . picture really good , even 6 hour recording time , which i use my decorating shows . change thumbnail feature also great . it allows you select what picture displays when you browse through programs . this wonderful feature important me , esp decorating shows , where i thumbnail feature room i like . after reading some reviews here it seems my unit lot cool features which would great someone who into electronics . i am basic girl , so i don't need lot bells whistles . i just need it what i want without any hassles without reading 400-page manual . my only quibble some buttons remote kind small , even my smaller female hands . rca i put tv downstairs starting mess up lot now , so i purchasing new unit . i've read reviews dmr-es20 , but since i am happy this unit i am going buy one	1

i 512 simpletech card , loved it . i got this 1gb card week ago it worked great . 512 card used very heavily nearly 2 years , so i purchased simpletech again . card maxs out meter which suggests how many pictures i remaining take , unless it highest setting . it says i fit roughly 950 pictures this 3.0 mp camera highest settings , but i not able take many yet ! batteries only last 300 pictures , so i probably don't need card this big . it nice videos though , it hold 15-20 minutes video 640x480 15fps . it also seems write very quickly . much quicker than my lexar card . most users , i would suggest 2x512 cards rather than 1x1gb . don't keep all your eggs 1 basket	1
i've using these earbuds several months now , they're far better than ones come ipod . they're more comfortable , there so much more bass , although everyone else pointed out you push them way into your ears get bass . my pair gone through washing machine twice dryer once , they still sound just good day i got them !

power ups ! everything you need know . first all why you want power ups ? there some very good reasons . ( 1 ) you never want your machine go down incorrectly because blackout . ( 2 ) you want work clean power only . ( 3 ) you want monitor your pc power . ( 4 ) you want prevent your pc damaged due power problem like lighting strike want surge protection . first rule ups never trust insurance claim . get your pc insured elsewhere . these companies tendency not support their insurance claims . i pc running some very high specifications over six usb devices , lcd monitor , printer ethernet equipment , everything same time . i never gone above 325w usage average 250w 300w when managing high spec game doing lots background tasks . even though i 400w power supply unit ( psu ) i upgrading 500w psu because it better quality model . way i monitor how many watts i use ups software hardware . so question you need ask how many watts you using . short answer this you don't know until you install ups software tells you how many watts you use because appears only way you monitor your wattage this time . you need estimate what it . i would say high-end domestic pc ( not server ) would use 300w max if it one every device you think off turned . soon we add things like pc , or several printers , or several monitors , then we start overload 325w ups . this brings us first thing we need learn any ups - overloading balancing . overload feature warning system turns when you overloaded ups capacity . overloading two things . it theory eventually damage ups it voids warranty . most ups 325w but there 800w - 1000w even greater models out there home networks use more than one pc setup but honest you probably going get ups per pc setup rather than expensive bigger ups network . so check ups rating . what ups you choose depends how much you want load it . next thing you need check ups if it comes usb connection . if it this big plus because it means you control it your pc ups comes software . now if ups this feature then you loads stuff like turning off ups sound alarms , controlling how your ups handles blackout , how long it uses battery before shutdown or hibernation , if it sounds alarm or not , if it run self tests , data collection monitoring , notifications sensitivity settings . if ups not come usb connection software then you probably should looking ups designed computer use rather than ups non-computer equipment . most ups led indicators tell you status unit . next thing understand testing your ups not breaking it out box , connecting it mains , plugging your pc then turning off house power circuit breaker . you must charge ups first ! so read instructions . usually you must attach battery ups ( plug it firmly ! ) wait before using it . then perform test using software first ! then you consider trying simulate blackout your home see if pc stays up . usually ups programmed shutdown your pc if blackout lasts few seconds . nearly all ups models usb connection customized shutdown event or how long pc should hold ups battery . most ups devices allow you connect modem phone line into device then run phone line into your modem . this important because power surges ups not this protection damage pc through unprotected phone line running into modem usually runs pc somehow . this nasty problem degree security ups provide . if it doesn't this function then it not going provide 100% surge protection pc on-line . networking ups pc pc without ups also increase risk surge protection problems . it not recommend you network ups pc non-ups pc unless surge protection warranty not issue . one last thing some ups input regions ups surge protection other input regions not surge protected . also some models batteries need replaced after few years if you end up using them lot . this everything you need know ups before you choose one . it basically now downloading technical specs ups making sure it provides you what you need . two top brands apc belkin	1
you may well pitch instructions because they're worthless ( only reason i'm not giving 5-star rating ads tech video xpress ) . i ready pitch product well , after losing two evenings trying figure out how get it work . ultimately , i gave up relying solely program it came , i instead opted try it my windows movie maker . yahoo ! perseverance paid off ! once i switched movie maker , this tool worked great ! date , i've converted dozen videos content computer files i able burn dvds . i just leave my xpress hooked up back my television so i don't try remember later how hook it up again . doing , i connect my laptop xpress start video converting process within 3-4 minutes . my movie maker program takes over entire process . ads tech video xpress especially useful me because i teach college telecourse often show edited video clips my students . before purchasing xpress , i crudely edited videos i reluctant use ; my videos lots amateur stop/start points . using movie maker xpress , i able download these videos my laptop , then easily edit them so transitions stop start points became smooth seamless . pretty cool . i'm glad i took chance this product ! below hook-up program instructions i've written myself easy reference later . hopefully they'll more help you than instructions come this product : first , hook up video xpress equipment follows : 1 . s-cable ( buy one , since it doesn't come videoxpress ) goes back your television videoxpress . 2 . use red/white/yellow cords running into back vcr/dvd hooked up your televion follows : - all three plug into " video out " column- all three plug into videoxpress tool other end . 3 . usb plug videoxpress tool plugs into back computer . next , open instant video xpress program verify settings follows : - " ntsc " video standard setting- " 640 480 " " 60 fps ( vga ) " video format- " dvd , vcr , tv " video source- " video composite " video inputunder program advanced settings : - low motion ( tv , vcd , dvd)- cpu support : " sse3 " - stereo system : " mts " - video decoder : " video standard : ntsc_m " under properties within program advanced settings : - stream format : video format : " ntsc_m " - frame rate : " 59.940 " - color space/compression : " yuy2 " - outputs size : " 640x480 " finally , close instant video xpress program . ( windows movie maker can't access video until this program closed . yes , it silly open it , make those setting changes , then close it , but video xpress won't work correctly unless you follow those setting steps . ) case you need this information windows movie maker , steps ( order ) follows : under " file , " click " capture video . " use following settings : - audio device set : " usb 2.0 analog audio device " - video input source set : " composite " under configure video capture device : - video format : video standard : " ntsc_m " frame rate : " 29.970 " color space/compression : " yuy2 " output size : " 640x480 " under camera settings : - deinterlace method : " low motion ( tv , vcd , dvd) " - cpu support : " sse3 " - stereosystem : " mts " under video decoder : video standard : " mtsc_m " signal detected : " 1 " lines detected : " 525 " then ... give file name indicate where save itset it " best quality " playback . then " start capture .

good thing first , efficient battery , convenient compact .. doubles up flash drive no cables except headphone carry around charge . thats it . most other reviewers said this product absolutely useless because low iq software people working sony . utterly non user friendly . i develop software living i am not afraid use new software ... even though i able use software main drawbacks over smartness software where it tries control music piracy .. i 1gb atrac songs this player my computer . then one day my computer hdd crashed . i kind thankful i saved atleast 1 gb music this bean walkman . atleast all hours i spent transfering not go waste . soon i fixed new hdd tried transfer songs back my computer .. useless sony softwre not take music files back ... i tried every trick even sony customer support could not help me ( very indifferent group people ) . it rotten piece software makes this efficient device waste money . course transfering files this player entirely diff story i dont want go abt .. it absolutely infuriating	-1

i've logitech g15 several months now it many features which i use regularly . paint doesn't seem wear off even if i rub or scratch keys . installation somewhat time consuming because keyboard drivers each part rather than one driver entire thing . pros- lights look great screen easily readable third party lcd apps highly customizable i use chat trillian access my buddy list screen . ( keystrokes go directly screen when you hit button reply , then i send it hitting enter ) i view winamp visualization song title , view my playlist , change various volume controls use standard playback functions i view network activity macros easy program key feel awesome compared my old keyboard . they nice solid click them , but pressure necessary keystroke length both small . cons- included lcd apps terrible useless me long setup more g-keys than you'll ever use minimal game support lcd apps take up valuable ram ( although not much ) keyboard profiler takes up ram must run maintain full functionality invisible lettering when lights off light brightness levels pointless . options : off-can't see it ! 1-visable but dim . 2-slightly more visible but still dim . usb ports usb 1.1 " gaming mode switch " ... i never hit windows key while gaming even though i usually use ctrl alt frequently . i think you'd really fumbling keys need feature wrist rest flimsy default lcd setting cycle through apps ( which i hate ) if i don't shut down properly , lcd profiler resets all its settings default . included pop3 checker doesn't ssl , you need get some ridiculous add which sucks up more resources . mail checker app+ ssl thing ends up little too resource heavy me appreciate . other words , its big pain get gmail working included checker . if you play lot world warcraft or really like tweak your settings streamline your interface , you might enjoy all macros . screen more useful non-gaming purposes , so don't buy it intent improve your hl2 experience ( since lcd doesn't display anything hl2 anyway ) . there many 3rd party lcd apps out there you probably find one make you love screen . warned , unless you use 3rd party apps , you probably disappointed lcd functionality . bottom line- recently priced spiked up these keyboards , i wouldn't pay new higher price one . this isn't kind item i would say i can't live without . its mainly luxury , unless you're serious computer geek ( like myself ) , you probably won't even know how utilize more advanced features . hardware solid powerful if you know how use it . included software cd ended up my trash .	1

this excellent machine . i bought two them . there few things you need . i 100% satisfaction using fujifilm dvd-r up 8x . i success fujifilm dvd+r up 8x . i`ve also tremendous success tdk dvd+r up 4x 8x . some other brands may not work . one thing i`ve learned this machine you baby it little . don`t go recording 3 or 4 -r or +r dvds every day . give it rest recordings . one or two per day okay . definitely give it room breathe . if you stack your machines top each other , put something so they breathe . sure not block ventilation holes sides . you definitely need buy panasonic dvd player play back your dvds - other brand dvd players may not play your recordings properly . one greatest things this machine it records dvd-ram . they re-recordable many , many times each program erased when watched . you even edit recordings dvd-ram . cut out commercials fit more disc or remove commercials when you watch program . only works dvd-ram . i over 50 dvd-ram discs ( panasonic brand ) - they sure take up less space than vcr tapes ! get one or two these recorders panasonic dvd player you`ve got it made ! throw away your vcrs forever ! just remember baby them	1

i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1
it really cheap , cheapes around . also it works fine , no complaints . but it looks little weird , packaging sticker card . maybe nock off ? since it says made china , but it works none less .	1
i used this mouse 3 months my laptop . look/feel general use fine short periods time ( ~ lt ; 1 hour ) . however , i am currently shopping replacement this mouse one problem : intermittently , after clicking/double-clicking , mouse go into " move left " mode ... continue move until it reaches edge screen . sometimes it move upper-left . this so inconsistent unpredictable . i often ( least 10 times 30 minute period ) give mouse wiggle stop it continuing . frustrating if you trying click through multi-level menu , instance . example if you working any cad-type or image editing project where you need insert line one segement time ( mouse move when it feels like it ) . it ok while , but now it annoying ... going buy replacement . if i buy replacement product because how product performs early stage its life , it gets no more than 2 stars . it could just this one particular mouse , but then points lack qa manufacturer end ... again , 2 stars	1

if you want budget home theater system under $200 there probably not many systems better then sony ht-ddw700 . this system ideal small rooms such bed room or tiny living room . considering price , sound quality actually better then expected me . tiny cube speakers presents pretty good clarity . they may look like cheap computer speakers but they aren't bit heavier then they look . center channel may little underpowered since dialog during dvd movies sound tad soft little too low . surround effects during movies dolby digital dts very good though . if set up properly speakers handle surround effects very well . some minor complaints speaker wire attached speakers very thin . they fixed can't replaced . also , if you want heart stopping bass then this system might not you . 8 " subwoofer okay considering price system . it currently better then any other sub included home theater system under $200 . it isn't powered , very light ( only 9 lbs ) you pretty close actually feel bass . volume would cranked up extremely high sub actually rattle your walls . receiver comes 1 optical 1 coxial digital input 4 rca analog inputs . it should enough most cases . extra digtal input or two wouldn't hurt but again system under $200 . setup couldn't easier . you just hook up included microphone , place it your listening postion press button remote . system automatically sets up speaker distance , delay volume levels . receiver comes basic pro logic ii music move modes upmix your stereo sources . it also other sound fields effects enhace sound but they don't really seem enhance sound much if all . basically , if you want home theater system small room under $200 then there isn't much better then sony ht-ddw70	1

i bought blue logger both street atlas 2005 sa2005 hh my dell x50v . no problem blue logger gps but my complaints follows : 1 . delorme not include blue logger manager software hh . now they want sell it separately additional $39 . very weird marketing strategy indeed . 2 . software pocket pc very difficult use , not very intuitive . it seems hand held software developed afterthought software pc . it poorly designed , appeared not fully tested normal users prior releasing market . 3 . it very cumbersome slow determine route . even 620 mhz axim , it slow . worse yet , route often wrong . example , this afternoon i use sa2005 determine route friend house . i followed route , i would come dead end street back track 10 miles get correct route my destination . luckily , i decided use my paper map . later , i tried microsoft mapping internet it actually gave me correct routing . last week location , sa2005 found wrong location given address which would take me 4 miles off . luckily , i knew where it ignored routing sa2005 hh . 4 . many other mapping softwares hh allow one use it 1 hand often finger . but not sa2005 hh . after 2 weeks using it , i found myself going back my old paper map . example , if i not calculated route just simply use gps map travel , software only show street i but no name given no street name shown upcoming cross streets . it not help when you lost . 5 . sa2005 maps seems several years old not very up date . i guess that why delorme not want clearly advertise this issue . i am seriously considering giving up sa2005 consider this my $50 learning mistake , looking microsoft street trip 2005 or later 1q 2005 , iguidance who supposed latest map . i am not alone this several other users also complained delorme user forum . i wish i read forum before buying delorme software . well , live learn .	1

i am audio quality freak ! i love flac ape , 64-bit decoding , cowon jet audio sound re-production over windows media player any day week . i picked this up evil blue yellow box store town , i'm blown away . i never found sound card i extremely happy sound reproduction through headphones until now . generic c-media drivers xp/vista work best , no need equalize or install turtle beach drivers . using set panasonic rp-ht355 headphones , ( course , i bypassed potentiometer headphones because they all add resistance ) this sound absolutely breathtaking . read review these headphones if you looking great sound budge t.t he only other device put out this sound quality my alesis multi-mix firewire sound mixer . but this pro-audio device , it $300 unit ! volume 15% - 20% , loudness option checked advanced properties , this usb sound card more than reproduce enough sound through headphones make it feel like your studio artist performing . works great native vista drivers too ! far negative reviews go , they probably bad headphones , or received bad unit , there no way this device puts out anything but crystal clear sound . i make sure no windows sounds using device primary sound driver , keep all little clicks windows navigation sounds out , set jet-audio direct sound output this card when available . hot swap great xp vista beta2 . i've used these same headphones ... creative sb live 5.1 , audigy ls , soundmax integrated hd audio ( asus a8r-mvp crossfire onboard audio ) , alesis multimix firewire 8 sound cards . only sound card i would say sounds equal or better alesis . buy this - you not sorry	1

i now own three different pairs clip-on earphones : koss , altec-lansing , sony . sony best , these reasons : 1 . they position speaker so it facing forward rather than towards center your head . this way , you get direct sound your eardrum , consequently sound louder ( saves your batteries ) , you get better high-frequency response ( sound doesn't turn corner get your eardrum ) . it just sounds better than others . 2 . stiff plastic design ( no moving parts ) makes them very easy get off , easy tell left right . they don't move around once they your ears . 3 . cord sliding part which allows you secure wires up under your chin , effectively giving you single wire your neck sound source . handy keeping wires out your zippers collar , , i think , handy running , keep everything secure . 4 . no foam irritate your ear distance your eardrum sound . too bad they orange . but orange almost fleshtone , so it isn't too bad ( white guy ) . other clip-on might look niftier ( altecs some chrome which looks way cool ) , but they don't work well . these great clip-ons . just buy them . this price , i'll buy second pair .	1
i'd read reviews amazon elsewhere , therefore knew what expect . product good price , expected . speaker wires too thin . physical set up easy but tuning speakers not . upscaling 1080i very impressive using hdmi ; haven't tried component . remote control easy use but not always intuitive ( how i turn off subtitles without punching multiple buttons ? ) . works well my samsung dlp 1080p . packaging downright unacceptable . box styrofoam packaging too thin . dvd player/receiver placed box top everything else , little protection its wide ( 17 " x18 " ) top . box damaged dvd player dent it causes tray grate stick . brings me return/refund policy . amazon amazing customer service - very prompt , polite , professional , etc . however , they're not able replace just dvd player/receiver unit . entire system replaced i.e. entire 60lb+ package travel back forth . now it turns out they're out stock this product therefore only able offer refunds , price-match when it come back stock . that good hear but still means entire system repacked , shipped back them , get refund then wait without system till they're able ship one out . i understand how they'd see this equitable them customer but it too cumbersome	1

fantastic portable gps unit . crystal clear , bright , wide screen display best market . current leg directions displayed band across top screen ( like other nuvis ) white letters green background ... reminiscent big interstate signs ... nice touch . built-in speaker loud clear enough i haven't even considered using fm transmitter , although you certainly . very fast route recalculation . low profile , super adherent , windshield mount excellent . i going look into other mounts , but discovered its great when mounted low , center windshield . this almost makes it seem like its mounted dashboard . 660 wide screen conceals mount completely , so you don't even see it . ok , 660 bit pricey , but why settle something you may not satisfied ? it .... now	1

t've using panasonic dvd ram over two years cannot imagine not it . i installed lg4082 my pc because it reads all formats albeit verrrrrrry slowwwwwly . i make dvds pc play them my tv if i choose vise versa . you use ram second hard drive . record your imformation then edit it way you want it ; transfer it h.d. , then transfer finished data permanent -r disc . i used record whole week one hour shows then weekend edit out chaff file main points . programs late lamented " call help " " screensavers " late lamented techtv channel . i also use ram disc record everything i watch case i miss something want replay . who needs tivo ? i tried r/w system but it just seems little too finicky me . i 10 r/w discs now i 8 r/w coasters . r/w bad habit finalizing disc even if your recording fails some reason you end up blank disc your recorder thinks full or non recordable . i think i'll stick dvd ram now , it winner	1

price , these headphones surprisingly good all respects except sound quality . although i'm not qualified give critical audio review ( but nobody who qualified would review these ) , i think most people would agree me their frequency response goes fairly low , but they excessive middle/upper bass peak . high end doesn't seem go high advertised ( i didn't notice any " air " ) , there seems pronounced peak range corresponding cymbals vocal sibiliance . when listening popular radio ( which i get variety source material ) , which boosts these same bands , combination nauseating . i hoping they'd flatten out after breaking couple days , although bass got deeper cleaner , low-end peak remained , high end didn't improve . they reproduce simple sounds quite nicely , but complex passages become blur . but then , phones everything well probably cost five times much , or more . it would interesting see what philips could twice price . i experimented reversing absolute polarity ( which required chopping off connector reconnecting " hots " " grounds " " grounds " " hots " ) , but sound got worse , so it already optimal my system , unfortunately . instead in-line volume control , which seems useless this day remotely-controlled volume , philips should provide in-line absolute-polarity switch . fact , all headphones should such control ( some grado phones them ) . correct polarity isn't always immediately apparent untrained ear , so give yourself some time ( possibly weeks typical listening ) , keep open mind . you'll eventually find you prefer one polarity over other . i reversed polarity speakers dirt-cheap tv , sound improved considerably , so it help even most basic sound system . it also possible polarity change source source . some high-end preamps ( such some audio research ) absolute polarity control compensate such differences . it probably good idea turn volume down or mute preamp before " flipping " polarity avoid possibility blowing out anything down line , although i wouldn't surprised if ar polarity control automatically mutes preamp before reversing polarity . some disc players also such control , because it cheap easy digital realm . summary , i would say these headphones great deal unless you need something critical listening or popular radio .	1

needed fast aa charger charge up nimh batteries my camera flash unit , bit shopping research . found this unit decided give it try . comes 6 aa 2 aaa , so they get you started right off few batteries use , which nice . unpacked everything ( plastic package difficult open up , so careful ) plugged it . there cooling fan built which moves air across batteries during charging , so just make sure you don't rest charger where airflow blocked ( e.g. carpet ) . within stated 15 minutes , batteries tested out 1.2 volts my voltmeter . put batteries my flash took several dozen pictures night without any problems . yet really give them extreme durability test , but overall seems like it working fine so far . some additional comments - if you're looking buy this charger charge existing nimh batteries you may already own , aware charger some " intelligence " - , if battery " bad " , charger not charge these batteries . light turn , then start flashing indicating there problem batteries not charging . out 4 existing older nimh batteries i own , only 2 them charged this charger . i suspect brand new batteries not this problem . it charged my old batteries also within 15 minutes , these old batts tested out 1.2 volts again my voltmeter . based this trial , it not appear you need use ic3 batteries get ~ 15 minute charge times . package not indicate this requirement , either . i note other competing chargers market only give you 15 min charge times if you use special ic3 batteries . non-ic3 batts supposedly give you 30+ min charge times . not so this charger , my experience so far . nowhere package it tell you what input voltages charger supports , so i flipped it over read label unit . it requires 100 120 volt input , so if you plan using this overseas , you should bring voltage converter you . us voltage input only . unit little bulky , so if you going vacation , you'll probably pack it your luggage , not your camera case ( my existing 14 hour overnight charger small enough toted my camera case today ) . it comes cable plug into wall socket or adapter car use . instructions say if you charge batteries car , it take longer than 15 minutes . i not tried this yet don't know exactly how long it take . overall , i am happy purchase would recommend this unit anyone looking turn aa charge times around quickly , particularly any professional photographers who use these their external flash units	1
sure , there may other racks put looks over function , but if you need deep shelves large openings your phat gear , this value buy . i bought this thing house my home theater gear 200 cd changer . cd changer alone 19 inches deep 7 inches tall just won't fit into fancy stand sporting wire blind or shabby 4-6 inch shelf spacing . av receiver pretty big , too ... almost big changer -- it gets pretty hot boot . open rack design keeps air flowing helps prevent any meltdowns . so , if you " real " gear want inexpensive solution , sanus afa models may you .	1

me , this truly plug play device delivers goods ... set up literally two minutes . i simply needed more signal strength , some my machines suffered marginal signal . now , all them receive excellent signal . signal strength needs , i really think this device something should tried first before going alternative -- wireless range expanders/extenders . wireless range expanders , which require configuration routers , work very well once set up correctly . but many people i consider tech-savvy ( including myself ) pulled their hair out making them work . bottom line , this trick actiontec router came my fios service . $90 , it pricey , but time savings well worth it . think additional time saved if you ever change your router or network ! some people here mentioned problems this booster , but i still think this first method try ... worse case scenario , you always return it :	1

" 00-12345 " ... i dont think it linksys , i think this skype issue . sometimes it shows up " unknown " ... regardless , i dont want my business calls show up international number . i would rather " unknown " show up or best would my number appeared caller id . all all , this product more than meets its expectations value great	1

i picked up 327v just before new year . i found it large electronics chain store just under four hundred dollars . i knew it not built tuner , but i didn't need one what i want use this . i got it large screen computer display , watching my dvds my bedroom . overall , i must say this unit exceeded my expectations . picture quality excellent dvds . i haven't hooked it up computer yet , because it requires vga cable not come it ( i cable way ) . anyway , i only two minor complaints this unit . one bright blue led lit power button when unit off . it too bright my bedroom , so i've cover it tape . other complaint " universal " remote i my home theater receiver not able control this monitor . " learning " remote required , least most cases . this monitor too new codes programmed into most universal remotes . i purchased wall mount kit mount this unit wall , i think it looks excellent there . mount vesa 100mm 200mm pattern , which doesn't seem like common size . many mounts i saw either 100mm 100mm or 200mm 200mm . some even smaller 75mm 75mm . i finally find one right type , it very easy install wall , least me . i used built speakers think they sound great what they , but i'm waiting until i get my home theater speakers set up so i enjoy home theater experience . i know larger screen makes better home theater , but my bedroom too small make practical proposition . this screen feels like it just right size this room , approximately 14 ' 16 ' . i would recommend this monitor anyone looking something this size , long they don't need built tuner . if you satellite box , cable box , or vcr , it work tuner . order get hdtv functionality , you need hdtv capable tuner ( which most , if not all , vcrs not ) . since it no tuner , i don't understand why it buttons changing channels . this simply observation , not meant complaint this monitor	1

this keyboard folds out well i liked feel keys . however , ir connector needs direct connection ir port pda . ipaq , this port bottom handheld . 210 degree arm not rotate this area . order proper connectivity , you turn handheld its side . this then requires software program download ( not freeware i find ) rotate your screen landscape view , unless you read sideways without getting headache . before buying this product , check your handheld see if your ir port 4-8 o'clock - if so , this may difficult keyboard use	1

i purchased garmin forerunner 201 amazon , believing i buying reliable piece gear . it doesn't work properly any built up area , i.e. city , where most us live , or areas too many trees , i.e. where we city dwellers like go when we leave city . basically it leaves stretches your running route out , but stop watch carries ticking . so if you're like me , take satisfaction turning out fast-paced runs ( or what passes fast-paced us amateurs ) , 201 only source frustration . it'll time your run perfectly , just like any stop-watch ( duh ! ) , but then leave out some distance you ran , so you get mile mile average yo-yos very suspicious way . particularly when you've put out steady effort . it'll miss out bits your course different places day-by-day basis . you'll find yourself " adapting " info device gives you : how precision ? interval training feature even worst . you dial some mile repeats , timed interval , set off full blast . minutes tick mile never ends ! that when you find there gaps " mile " you're running , you're killing yourself when you've actually mile , should your rest period . i kid you not , i wouldn't dare sell gps device works 70% time i'm not speaking heavily built up areas , i run spaces where closest buildings least 60-90 feet away ... but this not worst it . i though i getting well made piece equipment . i live brazil , so i bought it off amazon , friend kindly brought it over me us . less than 1 year , it started turning on/off itself , crazy dysfunctional way , rendering it totally unusable . currently it doesn't stay more than 1 minute time . it now runs it battery flat itself . even though i'd scrupulously careful w/ it , not taking it out rain , drying off moisture sweat after every run religiously . some you may say i should used warranty , but when you mailing costs brazil-us , if thing fixed or replaced , 100% customs duty when it gets sent back here , you'd give up , just i . i'm not paying twice piece gear never worked properly first place . my conclusion : try some other model , or even brand . i'd not lay my hard-earned cash this gizmo again	-1
this worst thing . never buy this one !!! there serious noise , big problem ..	-1
these headphones , i got over 5 months ago , i use them both my mac pc . great sound quality , better than bose , no joke . surround sound amazing gameing , its cheating when compaired stereo since now , when i get sniped , i hear gunshot rear right , i turn my rear right theres sniper ... haha i love them , i bring them road trips , school , everywhere . people like " they dont look cool " i dont care ... although they bulky not too portable , great quality price . these phones better , they would noise canceling , smaller , more portable , better adapter 2.5 mm jacks , i always loose little black thing , my ipod , great sound quality , but sometimes when ipod stops musci cuz sensor thinks jack unplugged ... but this happenes like once per 30 mins , no biggie , just press play again . other than non portablility fact little adapter gets lost eaisly due my clumbseyness , there best headhones i ever purchased . dont discouraged non name brand . these headphones circles around bose since they essentially 4 speakers eash ear , sub , 1 frount , 1 rear , 1 center , they all distribute music audio well , since sub takes lows , center takes midrange , take tweeters , all mixed into one , sound ausome . where bose only 1 great speaker work , these headphones like compairing new dual core dual processor g5 4 processors single g5 imac , great performance , but 4 brains ( speakers ) better than one !!	1

if you're looking high-end , look clifford alarms , they now owned same parent company viper but they offer more user-programming options . hardware comparable quality , cliffords just offer more features . i clifford my sedan viper my truck . viper actually louder siren , but unlike clifford if i want adjust sensitivity glass breakage detector i take it back dealer whereas clifford i just it through remote . tip : make sure whoever installs your viper puts it " active arming " mode instead " passive arming " which drive you crazy because it automatically arm alarm every time you close all vehicle doors . i understand it higher up viper alarms simply added features like remote start 2-way remotes , but you not getting any upgraded hardware . these still way better than no-name cheapo alarms coming out now best buy other places . don't cut corners install , it involves cutting into your car electrical system so you want somebody who knows what they're doing	1

it seems run well cool , no doubt because its well thought out packaging . seagate reputation producing good drives . i bought this portable " master drive " use among two or more computers . why carry more than you ? i thought , save space , i would get few retractable usb cables avoid necessity always carrying more clutter cables . surprise !!! seagate uses extremely special purpose usb cable connect its usb receptacle . none my other cables work it . firstly , receptacle so far recessed into drive casing ordinary usb cable cannot reach into it . secondly , if you cut away some plastic surrounding male end cable , it fit into receptacle but ( surprise ! ) it not work . why ? i not know . i tried several other cables worked other drives devices but none worked seagate . i tried searching similar cables internet but , after searching exhaustively , found nothing . you contact seagate buy its special purpose cables ( $9.25 + tax/shipping each ) . pretext odd shaped cable some computers need second usb jack additional power . course , this rare it strikes me simply profit enhancement dodge . result : 8% higher cost more cable clutter	1

i used sw radios many years many manufacturers : sony , grundig , sangean , radio shack ( made sangean ) . this model eton stands up them all , elegantly designed , logical easy use , great sound . manual short sweet , well written . once you know drill , all settings easy fast . quite intuitive well . there amazing 500 possible presets , though i barely scape up 30 i would use regularly . sound all bands rich . fm superb . there even ' antenna trim ' usable sw bands which rare all but most expensive radios . design feel elegant solid . all buttons knobs positive , affirmative action . two criticisms : e10 goes through sets four batteries little eight hours , entire memory wiped out when batteries get low . but , all all , great radio price	1
good , but just short great . key action nice light , low-travel makes it very easy your fingers really fly across keys , pretty quietly , too . i like fact they trying make keyboards more spill resistant , because i killed more than one keyboard spilling drink it . i no idea how well spill-resistance , though , i am not willfully go testing it out or anything . profile very thin , footprint also smaller than average . personally , i would not minded keyboard little bit wider , because order save space , microsoft re-arranged insert-delete-home-end-pgup pgdn keys two vertical lines instead more common two horizontal lines . i use those keys quite bit text file navigation while programming , learning how use this new configuration touch took me week or so , which kind annoying . small niggle lack usb adapter . doubt , it helps keep price down , but i would really love able use this keyboard my ibook well my pc , but order , i'll buy third-party adapter . , always , inclusion extra keys top keyboard almost useless . i say almost , because i actually use calculator key often enough , but rest nothing but waste space . despite these complaints , i still think one thing microsoft still well hardware . their keyboards mice pretty solid . basic , no frills keyboard , this much better than you would usually get so cheap .	1

number radio stations not yet bought up clear channel , still aimed somewhat graying population , steadily decreasing , we looking radio ability receive one last stations houston area we enjoyed listening , but , because its location 40 miles away liberty , texas , impossible pick up our home . we thought it possible , because plain-jane radio our f-150 picked up station very clearly pasadena we drove work baytown . we tried couple other radios advertised their ability what we wanted , able reach out farther separate stations situated closely radio dial , but no success all . i don't remember where i first heard boston acoustic radio , but it appeared able what we wanted , i continued search out everything it i could , using google . limited experience amazon.com, i knew many vendors sell their merchandise discount here , , " voila . " there it , lowest price i found anywhere . radio arrived almost soon if i'd bought it mall , we nothing but happy it since . my son , who more critical ear than me , told me sound really good . we now get hear enjoy khsn-fm 99.9 mhz , " shine-all-nine " here pasadena . unsuspected bonus , we're also able pick up more powerful am stations(at night , when weather right ) located around middle country , st. louis(kmox-am 1120 ) , shreveport(kwkh-am 1130 ) , nashville , gallatin , tennessee . bottom line -- high quality am-fm radio , very decent price . i like it	1

first all - i really enjoy listening xm radio , which what made me consider buying this extension device receiver . it truly good way further utilize roady2 , allowing you listen either xm , or tune local fm stations ( why anyone would want this , i don't know - maybe emergency or something ) . unit fairly simple set up . you first need charge battery putting it into place plugging included ac adapter . it takes 2 hours charge then you ready use unit . you slide roady2 into device until it plugs . ( if you set up roady2 home adapter or auto adapter - you must first remove backing plate roady2 - it snap off little leverage ( light ) straight edge screwdriver . ) after you installed roady2 unit , you good go . first , volume tuning controls side unit little vexing use , but some practice helps you readily raise or lower volume or tune fm radio stations . additional help , there small wheel volume control right ear section headphones . headphone acts your antenna unit whole thing then works very well . i am pleased this unit , but i would advise shopping price , it vary much $100.00 low high . all all , nice addition further utilize roady2	1

maximum archival life cds , it good idea keep them both jewel case , outer container well . after doing fairly extensive web search , i discovered selection boxes hold cds , while contained within jewel case , actually rather limited . many these cases $30-$60 range , actually hold fewer cds than these cases o.o downside , these cases rather plain appearing business-like . but i didn't want flaming pink , anyway . also , their style not lend them portable . files used daily , or something you want carry around you , it may good idea get something more durable carrying handle , made metal or heavy plastic . these boxes made out coated cardboard , fact clearly stated description . but they quite sturdy , if used only occasionally , should last many years . but these cases could damaged , if they accidentally soaked water , or kept extremely damp environment . archival storage occasional access , this best deal i could find , especially considering almost-nominal price . if you lot cds , fill several-to-many containers , only access them occasionally ; these boxes good choice . i probably buy some more , i continue generate cds need stored .	1

i used acronis true image 9 year . i never needed it until today when i cloned my laptop drive external usb drive , put new 100 gb drive laptop , put acronis boot disk , then cloned usb drive back laptop . voila ! perfect . perfectly functioning drive .... but now i 100 gb not 40 gb . i problems getting backup images complete error-free ( sure you defrag your hd first before you image if it needs it ) . i also problems images when i use ' check-verify integrity image ' utility . one time it tells me image corrupt , i run it again it says its fine . screensavers may culprit here .... disable them when making image . if you're going make image ' set it forget it ' .... don't try working your machine while it images . acronis says you this but i don't see point ' driving car trying photograph it same time ( get it ? )' .... it doesn't make sense . use image time spend some quality time your kids , wife , or etc . it took me 39 minutes clone 37.2 gb data onto new 100gb drive . i agree several other users : clone only . cloned drive backups beautiful . you open it explorer , peruse your files folders just like your primary drive , all order check sure data there . here tip : use acronis ti clone your drive . then use program like storage crypt 2.0 encrypt this drive .... then put it your car glove box , your garage , safe deposit box , your tool shed ... anywhere but your house ( don't forget clone occasionally ) . when your house burns down , gets hit tornado ( i live kansas ) , or thieves steal your equipment , you hidden encrypted backup clone drive your data . heck , you replace laptop ; it data you cannot replace . drive encrypted it stolen not show up when connected computer unless you know what program encrypted it what password de-crypt it so it shows up windows explorer . i give it 4 stars because ' image ' function not reliable . but cloning superb	1

i like shure e3g . i don't think them ultimate in-ear-monitor experience , but they've given me much more than lot headphones i've listened recent bought aggressive pricing-cutting their current stock , shure working hard change e3g psp-owner status symbol something like bargain portable audio lovers . sound user going out pair in-ear-monitors , ( shure series , or etymotic er6i/er4 , westone monitors , etc . ) depends number factors which rapidly make any accurate assessment their performance problematic . all in-ear-monitors work putting sound source into just right place auditory canal all frequencies music or other listening you then sealing out external sounds so you get accurate sound volume less likely destroy your hearing any use in-ear-monitors involves arrangement factors which some may find not faint-hearted . e3g no exception . they placed * just right * ear canal , your sound source just right base level music you're listening through them or your music become flat or take strange emphasis . once you get it right though , shure e3s revelation . i use my headphones foreign language study programs music accuracy shure e3g very good both jobs its best , it revelation . two examples ( using sony mz-nh600d mini-disc walkman levels adjusted sound source using yellow foam eartips ): 1 . topic entertainment " total immersion japanese " demonstrated not only enough clarity me hear every nuance what speaker say but me hear artifacts material introduced recording process -- tiny halo white noise before after each phrase -- even flaws isolation recording studio itself sound passing cars . 2 . peter gabriel , " passion : music movie , last temptation christ , tracks 1 2 , ' feeling begins , " " gethsamene " displayed some very good nuances including breathiness wooden flutes very sexy separation overlapping percussion . all all , however , best thing e3g not their base-response but their basic , meat-and-potatoes accuracy . they allow someone like me poor hearing not only hear music but hear subtleties went into studio work behind music . physically speaking , they far , far more robust than etymotic er6/er6i they much better thought out terms human factors engineering like getting them into out your ears without damaging them . units come pocket-sized , semi-rigid , woven nylon case cord-spool inside ( best such item included * any * monitors market ) protect your investment well number ear-tips designed offer compromise comfort isolation . last , yellow , crush-and-expand foam units offer far best isolation base response ( thus , best sound ) but cost their fragility need change them often . i give e3g four stars would definitely five if shure given units just smidgen more base response made replacement foam eartips slightly less expensive ( approximately $20 10 pairs ) , they would lot closer perfect then . things stand , their current pricing , i no regrets voted them my money .	1

i love this tv , i usually buy samsung , i 32 " 3251d thats great other than crappy built speakers . this tv looks sweet great std def picture , which seperates it cheaper brands . most hdtv look great hd signal but good tv handle dirty signals well . this tv brand new model both tuners built , i watch hbo without cable box cluttering up my bedroom . i thought it going small even my small bedroom but it worked out great . best 400 buvks i ever spend amazon , they best price this model . havent bleed problem mentioned , but all lcds light leakage when no signal present all black screen , its backlight , this one pretty uniform backlight , maybe even better than previous gen 3251d i own . i also like light bottom , it glows nice shade blue . this tv woudl perfect 300-350 dollars but you get what you pay , much better than vizio 20 " costco same price ...	1

i owned pair etymotic er6is pair shure e2s , which both very good quality earbuds , but i say , this far best pair in-ear-monitors i ever owned . you really hear difference earbuds single drivers these dual driver monitors . lows highs don't interfere each other , which may may difficult understand , but you when you hear them . no matter how low bass , highs still constant unaffected ... vice versa . however , my opinion , difference audio quality these earbuds pair less price ( like shure e2cs , example ) , what some may consider , subtle . but , true audiophile , this difference just enough justify spending so much pair buds . i took these through few brief tests when i got them , playing several mp3s rather bass heavy known produce poor sound previously owned earbuds ... i smiled . ues played bass clearly highs bright uninterrupted , way they meant heard . construction quality materials , they could use some work . cord tad bit cheap i'm curious see how long it lasts before shorting out , but brings me absolutely genius idea they created . user replaceable cord . everyone knows , cords short out . there no headphone not short out . my guess , drivers last quite some time , but no matter what , cord short out . well , $20 , you get brand new cord . old one simply unplugs buds ... but don't worry just yet , because they very generous 2 year warranty . what more could you ask ? short , i recommend buying these earbuds . they best i've ever owned , if you very picky ears , they'll appreciate them	1

i bought this printer because my wife wanted printer she could print out photo her new canon digital camera . since camera canon pictbridge , no computer needed this printer . you print directly camera which quick easy . this printer only photo , but it prints out great looking 4 6 pictures very fast . quality excellent , i don't believe you distinguish them pictures printed photo lab . i didn't actually measure how long it took print picture , but it very fast . good guesstimate would appox 60-80 seconds . it not use ink , but process called dye sublimation . according photo printer experts , photos dye-sublimation printer much more durable fade much more slowly than photos inkjet printer . dye-sublimation printing process performed three times , one time each cyan , magenta , yellow dyes , then repeated fourth time apply protective coating print . protective coating applied during fourth pass laminate blocks uv ( ultraviolet ) light , makes dye-sub print waterproof , scratch-resistant fade-resistant . so , this printer give you instant gratification lab quality prints last lifetime without fading ! this printer very compact , so you actually take it you if you want . there optional battery so you print out pictures anytime , anywhere . most people this won't necessary , but those professional individuals who might currently using older " polaroid " instant camera , this allows you take big step up picture quality ! i believe using this printer your digital camera would also less expensive . print cartridges photo paper sold set . i found amazon best prices . only drawback ( which isn't really negative ) cost print cartridges photo paper . it slightly higher than average . quality prints convenience however should taken into consideration . instant gratification quality comes slight premium , i fully believe it worth it . we purchased 100 pack amazon around $23.00 shipping . works out $0.23 ea . only $0.06 more local photo lab . ( doesn't include gas , wear tear car time traveling local photo mega mart . probably washes if you really want analyze it death .... )	1

toshiba second generation unit , hd a2 , very attractive , glossy front silver trim . although console dimensions much smaller more streamlined than a1 , we lose analog audio outputs . its width height comparable typical dvd player , however , its depth little longer , few inches back . no biggie . remote medium sized , black plastic plenty function buttons , but not very intuitive their placement . start up minute or less , which not very annoying if you power unit , then go get snack or take bio break , etc . hd dvd take 30 seconds play . again , neglible wait ample rewards . i own sony 50 inch 50a2000 sxrd 1080p display , which no problems handshaking toshiba via hdmi output . i purchased 9 hd dvd watched 6 so far . every title except one ( terminator 3 - it nice , but expecting more relatively new film , since dvd looked so good ) ranged impressive stunning . thing('82 ) breathtaking . detail kurt russel beard , eye color , etc . popped . mutiny bounty looked like oil painting . willy wonka beautiful . lee marvin never looked so good dirty dozen ( minor film grain ) . it wonderful thing movie hd all extras one side disc , so far . i not seem miss player capable 1080p vs . 1080i , but technology drops price , i may further investigate matter . some(the ht guys ) say , lcd displays inherently progressive scan , so your set may making 1080i signal appear 1080p or close enough my liking . i wasn't willing pay extra $100 a20 find out , so please excuse my conjecture . hd dvd menus really fun , allowing one view them while movie still playing . yes , scan features fast-forwarding , rewinding little sluggish , but so first dvd players . price 1st ... or 2nd . i usually am playing hd dvd wowed picture resolution , not zip through it . some hd dvd titles offer zoom function , allowing you focus 2 , 4 or 8 times closer , however , it doesn't seem ready prime time . if you try pan around screen while zoom , player audio jitter lose sync , which reset stopping machine then hitting play again . again , i am not usually zooming around . i want theater experience my home , but it system limitation . upon reading numerous reviews regarding a2 upscaling potential regular dvd , i understandably curious . i own 2 upconverting dvd players , one panasonic one sony . both use hdmi connections . although panasonic seems brighter more colorful than sony , panasonic seems more combing noise . perhaps , i am not critcial , but it seemed close shave toshiba a2 my other upconverting players far regular dvd , so i can't say i blown away matter . i really like fact toshiba a2 digital clock , adjustable led display dimmer , very nice statistic data via display button(codec type , time , duration , chapters , available audio formats ) i am very happy pcm audio output my optical connection . i not hdmi switching my amp yet . bottom line : if you hdtv you want show off its 1080 resolution reasonable price you can't wait decent combo player or just want " wowed " budget , i wholeheartedly recommend this machine your home theater	1

got this case so my granddaughter could watch videos her portable player while going long trip car . straps little tricky first so sure follow directions exactly . dual head phone jacks handy two rear seat passengers . good value money	1
this perfect case someone who loves run or workout . clip tightly attaches any piece clothing , even though it somewhat hard put take off	1
i bought this item best buy . it works great until it time change batteries . battery cover hard open , which caused back piece break off . since then , mouse not work anymore . i would not recommend this mouse	1
we're not sure where " trevor ( florida usa ) " coming up this statement it mono signal . our tech guys tested integrity rca jack stereo jack they both giving left right signal . i even tested it myself hooking up rca jack stereo jack into my dvd player audio out then connecting transmitter broadcasting it my stereo system . i then used thx sound system testing sequence dvd when it playing left you only hear it left speaker vice versa right speaker . we offered replace rca jack but he didn't follow up us	1
i using linksys wired router/switch few years . i constantly losing vpn connection re-connect . i put voip ( vonage ) phone restart every 3 hours . i thought i cable modem problems , network problems , config . problems router . finally , i ordered d-link ebr-2310 ( because it very inexpensive ) . i took it out box , plugged it , connected my ( 4 ) network cables including wireless connection . 6 weeks i not single connection problem . what difference ! - highly recommended .	1
this cable great solution if you dont want carry your cradle all over place . cable synced well charges my ipaq . i using it 2 months yet problem . most all price great without sacrificing quality . i would definetly reccomend . great buy !!	1
sennheiser got it right . these simple . they comfortable , even long runs . they great sound . they stay put while i am running . gravity enemy other headphones i've used , always making them slip out ear or away position optimal sound . because design these earpieces conecting band , gravity actually holds them place . i never fidget them . also , since there only one lead wire , it stays out way without trying engineer solution . these best i've tried	1
i love these cases . i bought one set try out thinpaking my dvds , then ordered 4 more rest . i currently own 157 dvds , so far i've moved 97 over these cases ( rest mostly box sets or already thinpaked ) . its very easy adjust covers fit these thinner cases , just trim 1-2 mms two sides , then slide it . i recommend using straight edge blade ruler or other straight guide get best results . every new dvd i get immediately get moved these cases future . my entertainment center no longer double stacked looks much neater	1
this cd player works well sounds great . all functions what you would expect shuffle actually plays randomly . i highly recommend this unit ; it cannot beat price	1
first downside:i've found bluetooth pretty much worthless . if you get link hold it works fine but i've never seen phone gps stay linked entire trip . unit lots buttons options , however so many buttons you cannot possibly hold unit without inadvertently hitting one them . now upside : gps works fantastic performing its main function , getting you where you need go . i replaced my roadmate 700 this unit i tell you i am impressed operation 6000t . i not expecting 6000t much better then 700 but i wrong . this unit picks up your position very quickly i yet see it drop signal while traveling . it everything my 700 but it it even faster better . considering i paid $1100 back when i purchased 700 i paid less then $500 6000t , i don't see how you go wrong this unit . it shame they couldn't get bluetooth right but when you take everything into account , i'm happy i decided go this gps .	1
i using this product month , so far i am happy it . drive so small amount data i carry arund , so i am afraid lose it . , secure ii gives me great sense security . secure ii 9mb . it saved drive just like any other files you save , not protected anyway accidental deletion . so you careful not delete it other unwanted files or reformatting . first thing i make backup entire folder my pc . secure ii runs without any installation your computer . it create vault areas flash drive . example , if you make vault area called myspace size 500mb , you find file myspace . lxv ( size 500mb ) created secure ii folder . even if vault empty , lxv file takes up 500mb available space flash drive goes down 1.5 gb . anything you save vault absorbed reserved 500mb space not reduce remaining space ( 1.5 gb this case ) . using file explorer , all file names , or any related data , saved vault not shown , it shows only myspace . lxv . vault only accessible when computer you insert drive logged administrator . i created vault my home computer tried open it work computer which i don't administrative privilege . vault access dimmed out secure ii , i could not retrieve files inside . product calls win2000 xp system requirement . i tried it windows me machine , flash drive itself worked fine but secure ii not run seeking dll file . i one complaint physical design . hole strap ( which not come product ) put cap , not body . you come home notice you've lost drive data stored it , but cap still securely attached string your brief case .	1
how many pictures it store ? it most commonly asked question digital camera enthusiast but usually question most difficult get straight answer . well , considering i worked memory industry over 7 years i help clarify this perplexing question so unbiased i since changed industries . simpletech sti-sd/256 256mb securedigital card sd , like most 256mb cards , store average 284 pictures when used 2 megapixel camera , 213 images when used 3 megapixel camera , 128 pictures when used 4 megapixel camera , 102 images when used 5 megapixel camera , 80 pictures when used 6 megapixel camera . these numbers based off assumption you going shoot your images highest quality jpeg setting available camera understand they estimates may off much 10 percent due numerous factors including complexity scene shot compression algorithm used your specific camera . i truly hope this review helpful you determining whether this card right capacity your specific needs	1
good value money . product shipped bit extra padding so package spindle arrived intact undamaged	1
i bought this cable connect my playstation 3 hdtv set only dvi ( i think it dvi-i ) but no hdmi . this cable works beautifully . image quality really good . price just can't beat . you should aware while hdmi carries both audio video , dvi video only , so you still need route audio your tv somehow . example , i use optical digital audio cable ( together expensive converter box my old hdtv set doesn't optical input )	1
not only microphone not mac compatible ( stated review , unfortunately posted after my purchase ) , entire headset incompatible some cellphones well . three different model nokias soon set plugged , " enhancement not supported " flashed screens - never problem other headsets . it would helpful list compatible devices view before purchasing . i'll just pass these pc using friend hope they more luck .	-1

i originally looking $[ ... ] radios , but i concerned product durability quality fm/am reception . after reading some good reviews this sangean dt-300-vw , i decided jump higher price range try it . it great product , durable well worth price . i've used it 5-days week , more than 18 months now . i'm little hard it because i use it outside 30 minute jogs 45 minute bike rides . after all use , there just little static when adjusting volume control . 900mah rechargable batteries last more than couple weeks me . unit shuts off before batteries go completely dead , if you replace both batteries one time , you won't lose station settings . power lock good use either during activity , or when you store radio . i mostly listen fm music stations , am talk radio . reception fine both . clock alarm useful features . i keep case unit protection , but don't use belt-loop because it easily breaks off . unit small enough me hold my hand while jogging , or place my waist band while bike riding . i hate in-ear bud headphones , so i just purchased some regular external ones seperately	1
product exactly you would expect . drivers installed easily winxp(haven't tried vista yet ) , it compatible both software applications i wanted it . i use it primarily netstumbler , i've only one hiccup , but it com port conflict , so i can't really blame it device . your money , you can't go wrong	1
got mine two weeks ago all i say it just works beautifully . setup snap , no webpages or reading manual find out what default ip address , or anything like . i configured this thing 5 minutes literally ( i'm geek though ) not touched it since then . i'm using all features , cable router , wireless , sharing two disks printing ( using small belkin 4 port usb hub ) all this functionality just transparent my mac . wireless signal quality surprisingly good considering there no antennas hanging out device . also , disk sharing feature works quite fast over wireless , but you really feel difference if you wired though ( i'm using ) . it couple minor drawbacks my opinion , ( 1 ) lack gige , i don't care it but dealbreaker some guys ( 2 ) pricey if you just want router . although , if you think all features it makes sense spend few extra $	1
set up this switch required just plugging it worked . since i've installed it , i not touch it once . i am very happy this product	1

i recently purchased this item here , i so very impressed . it drastically improved quality my dvd player . you know difference quality when you switch watching regular tapes ( vhs ) dvd ? well , it same " step " when you watch dvds s-video , watching dvds s-video . my son said his playstation 2 looked 10 times better this s-video cord . it definatetly worth money ! highly recomended	1
sweet sweet sounds come out such tiny speaker . it incredible . this best record player you're sure come across this price . audio outputs all work like dream , sound modulating knobs fun . i love it . go buy one	1
my review this based my rating forerunner 201 unit itself . this just bracket , it works fine . however , you don't really need it if you don't mind simply wearing 201 your wrist . one caveat it , course , easier see unit when you riding if it mounted bike versus strapped your wrist . my recommendation if you going use 201 both running biking , don't buy this bracket because you simply wear 201 , plus then you don't deal trying remove wristband or making tight squeeze fit into bike bracket . but , if you buying 201 only biking , this may useful because then you could simply ditch wrist strap keep this mounted bike all times .	1
transferring first album my pc took roughly 5 hours . second took 3.5 hours , third 2 hours fourth 1.5 hours . learning software interface took inordinate amount time , even though i've interface programmer . after learning software , it appears every album cost hour record , mark songs , name songs write songs mp3 . if i want edit out song parts or eliminate pops/clicks , it take longer . it really time consuming software doesn't make it simple or intuitive . turntable reasonable quality . it just regular turntable built-in pre-amp . you turn pre-amp `on ' when recording your pc , turn if `off ' if you want use turntable your regular stereo	1
this product only reinforces earlier versions itself 1 2 gig versions . i feel it even better well made than 2 gig version . quality better than what i could asked , now 4 gigs make life even easier .	1

retrospect , i am not sure how well this worked . reviewer stated below , after couple years , when using my cordless phone , i started hear static , then eventually , i heard very loud , annoying pulse tone which person i called also heard . assuming line noise due my phone/dsl line , i called my telephone service provider check line . i thinking changing my dsl line filters or buying new phone ( assuming some problem my panasonic 2.6 ghz phone ) . when i figured out this device responsible , zapper went immediately into garbage . not sure what started problems ( bad battery ?, latent defect ? ) . end , am not sure how effective this device i still received plenty unsolicited calls . any case , this device not worth trouble cost .	-1

life long bose basher here , good reason ! many years ago ( 1990 ) i bought bose acoustimas system . it stereo store it sounded amazing - i bought one took it home it sounded tinny , flat cheap . i found out bose charges ton pay their marketing . they still use paper speaker drivers ! i returned acoustimass system years later tried 1-2-3 system ( 2 years ago ) i hooked up new system underwhelmed . my sony 60 " xbr tv speakers sounded just good . i returned it bose store , sweraing never buy bose product . ( i buy some tri-port headphones which very muddy bloated sounding)well , 2 weeks ago i bose store i saw wave music system new acoustic wave system . guy store told me new ( larger ) acoustic wave system their best stereo system . i bought one $1079 took it home . it sounded horrible . harsh , flat not spacious ( this larger acoustic wave ) all ! i felt ripped off . it ugly , cheap looking sounded horrible . my tivoli model 1 sounded better . not loud but better . off bose store i go return it . ( let me also say 3 years ago i owned $ 25,000 stereo only system super high end tube amps , pre amps , $5k cd player , etc . it my dream system i sell last year i some money issues . i really missed my system . ) so i return bose look little , smaller wave music system . it sounded spacious , big depth it very pleasing . it sounded much better than their so called " best " system . i shocked bose would make $1079 product sounded bad much worse than their $500 system . i decided take home graphite give themn one last chance . took it home , set it up wow ! it looked great my table . very nice look i love it no buttons it . plugged it .... this what i looking ! deep , big , spacious , room filling sound just enough bass . it sounded amazing piano music , jazz , classical , vocals , big band ... i then threw some rock consisting ac/dc , kiss even metallica . it sounded very good . not good other music but still bass , sounded very very good . i finally happy bose product ! add this alarm function , auto dimming display small size you think $500 deal . i bought large backlit remote $39 go it next day . bose wave music system great sounding system . those who bash this new version never heard it , period . remember , i came $ 25,000 system nothing made me happy until this system . not this any way better or even comparable my $25k system , but it kills larger acoustic wave , tivoli model 1 , boston acoustics $500 set cambride set . ( yes , i tried them all)if you wanted wave system but afraid bad reviews , don't . this new version wonderful fills my house rich , clear , deep sound . throw some ricky lee jones , diana krall , frank sinatra amazed huge sound coming this litle box	1
it worked ok 2 months , but kb kept falling off . when i complained , i told kb not compatible my viewsonic v37 . yet , it advertised compatible vs ppc 2002 . worse came when i upgraded ppc2003 kb stopped working . i contacted targus told they not plans upgrading their kb drivers this vs ppc . i not believe this should permitted . if you sell something , stand behind it . very disappointing	-1

this mouse perfect size . buttons side easy press once you get used them . now whenever i use anyone elses mouse i'm always trying find those buttons ! they're very handy . also this mouse moves very smoothly . pros : smooth tracking , buttons scroll wheel aren't loud , perfect precision , colors look fantastic when they glow ( they aren't keep you up night bright ) , white very clean looking not get dirty or chip easy all . cons : gold usb plug doesn't work when i start up my computer sometimes so i unplug mouse , plug it back , then it works . also tray icon enabled buttons sides work but it doesn't really bother me ... over all i give this mouse 5 star rating because its very easy use , its not huge mouse . i smaller hands they fit perfectly here considering most mice made ( logitech , microsoft ) so huge . i buy razer mouse if this one ever goes out	1

excellent idea , fatally flawed implementation . it appears limitation midi controller - drums fail sound intermittantly . since this appears design issue , except my request support ion-audio.com:i found problem my new ion ied05 electronic drum set - drums appear conflict , perhaps midi interface ( update : definitely controller ) , perhaps within alesis controller . when playing drums , pad fail sound intermittantly ( occasionally , whole system mute momentarily ) . i hope this isn't first you've heard this issue , fix available . course , i've checked connections , checked sure i'm hitting pads squarely center , tried swapping pads ( though issue affects all them , not just snare ) , etc . if fact , i often reproduce problem simply , repeatedly striking any two pads together , one split-second after other . when it happens , second appears mute first , before first fully produces tone . ________________________until/unless this issue resolved , you'll find set cause repeated frustration , whether learning , practice or performance . ________________________4/15/05 update : after sending kit back ( twice ) , received brand new replacement - which same flaw . ion support all they could - this serious design problem . final verdict - alesys drum machine seems operate fine ( triggering keyboard via midi , no drop-outs ) , but trigger-to-midi device ( ion branded black box labelled iet01 ) must problem . perhaps ok kit learning , but fatally flawed way lead no end frustration , renders kit unsuitable performance	-1
beats me , i just got it yesterday but i'll update this review time passes . i hp they seem prone heat prostrate so i decided get this yesterday , especially since last year factory installed blower spent too much time kicking into emergency mode than i liked . this computer automatically turns factory fan up high when air temperature reaches 72 degrees it loud . vcool i bought staples only one third loud when turned up high . pros : high rpm . three speed selector switch . glows blue when turned -- pretty but who cares . low apparently is/almost , silent . high one third loud factory fan running full blast . apparently blows air it sucks-in straight up . also i seem remember some this air blown down -- not much . i'm not sure temperature difference , however my computerfan usually goes high speed six times day , today it turned only once . price fair -- no s/h charges . cons : so far , only one : they should included instructions device instead assuming everybody reach them internet down load . i hope i hooked mine up correctly . i'll add or take away this review when i know more -- bye ! it april 18 -- all well .	1

this would received 5 if it weren't horrible customer service cowon . buyer beware , set your expectations very low their support . all times i treated them respect , never cursed or acted irate , which i must say very difficult considering way they treated me , new customer . 1 ) only way " speak " support through online chat or email . they not working phone numbers support . 2 ) i received 1 player , doa . replacement player also doa . it literally took 4 weeks before i received working player since they not offer cross shipping defective products ( they email ups ground shipping label , once unit arrives it sits their queue 5 business days , then they send replacement via ups ground)3 ) it not matter how professional you treat support team , they treat you like you inconveniencing them . 4 ) they not let you speak supervisor , they only relay your chat them5 ) check better business bureau rating , its currently fi really don't like so negative cowon but this whole experience left me wishing they didn't such technological superior product . i encouraged them alter their treatment their customers , never received response . even sent them letter , no response . their players great , customer support worst i ever encountered	1

okay , so i just bought jbl scs- 145.5 speaker system they absolutely horrible ! i'm sorry say , but center speaker ridiculously underpowered/barely audible other satellite speakers ( which also weak tend get distorted higher volumes or lot audio going through them ) . subwoofer * very * good , however , so i guess price tag justified subwoofer ( that why i gave it 2 stars ) , but other speakers pretty much useless . just case anyone wanted know how these , i'd recommend staying away them maybe spending slightly more getting better system	1

i've read some different opinions these ' phones people said they don't fit your head ( this ridiculous since they're adjustable ) or they very easy break , which my experience it exact opposite . i've caught cord things numerous times , somebody knock them off my desk , somebody even sat them they still remain same when i first purchased them . no scratches , cracks , disconnections or breaks any kind . i would actually inform people these quite sturdy durable instead making it seem though they snap first wrong move . sound quality just amazing price others noted , they're much better all-around headphones than sony brand same price range . i tested both long periods time gave them each fair amount burn-in . end sennheisers much bigger bang your buck . them sounding like tin cans or even more laughable : sounding better when they're cupped your hands , those statements just entirely false reviewer already pointed out . sound becomes much worse when this because it takes away sonic accuracy spatial experience . maybe reviewer who said this needs some new equipment or better understanding way these headphones supposed work . when you buy open headphones ( which , way , reproduce better sound than closed pair ) you should know what you're getting fact people able hear what you're listening if they're close enough . quality much better , that difference it reason they made this way . if you're looking privacy , grab sony v6 . all all these well worth price tag definitely bring smile your face if they're your first , second , or even third dip into audiophile territory . however , you must keep moving up line if your expectations become too high . headphones this range only so much these most certainly get job tag attached them . sure give them fair chance lot burn-in before you judge them	1

i just needed small inexpensive radio good stereo headphone jack listen work better reception than my iriver music player this guy fit bill perfectly . amazon carries suprisingly few compact fm radios digital tuning aren't garbage . no matter , this exactly what i needed . reception far better than my music player , even antenna unextended , battery life phenomenal . i've this few months , listening it average few hours week i am still my first pair batteries . my only complaint it others noted , tuner volume knobs hyper-sensitive . full range volume barely audible too loud occurs over like eighth rotation knob . fine tuning stations chore because it go 101.10 mhz 101.15 mhz pretty much just breathing it ( it 0.05 mhz digital tuning resolution ) . since tuning knob side , it gets budged slighly every time you remove it included sleeve so you need re-fine-tune it receive your station everytime you take it sleeve which gets kind frustrating . overall quality radio many features belie its low price . four stars based its fm tuner capability alone	1

other negative reviews correct . too small , can't see screen , fit so tight it affects wheel . i spent $30 dollars little strip cloth actually makes my nano nike+ useless . if this designed made some 3rd party it would make little bit sense , but it , i no idea how they screwed this up so badly	-1

i've my old logitech mouse more years than i remember . past few weeks wheel started acting up i finally decided it time order new mouse . this one looked lot like old one so i ordered it . i plugged it it worked right away . so far so good . wheel worked great ! plus . pointer true wire long enough suit my needs . i thought i'd died gone heaven , but then annoying clicking mouse brought me back around . click , click , click .... i decided i could get used over time . then i realized this mouse not one buttons old one . simple push button i'd go back screen internet . new mouse round thing looks like button , but it doesn't anything -- it just decoration place show logitech logo . i'm so disappointed not " back " button any longer . i so spoiled years . i needed new mouse this one wasn't too expensive , so i'll keep it . not altogether pleased it though -- thus " 4 " star rating .	1

this tv huge . i originally planning purchasing 50-55 inch tv $2k price range . there lot value this tv . hdtv looks awesome . it even looks better than dvds playing through over component cables . this tv doesn't 1080p support ( it 1080i though ) , but you're not really missing anything because most hdtv programs aren't transmitted higher than 720p ( which this tv fully supports ) . this tv also supports cablecards if your cable provider them available . other semi-problem mentioned earlier there wasn't enough high end inputs ( hdmi , dvi ) , it true though there enough component inputs if you prefer . anynet function tv guide feature useless me , but it always nice extra features . one neatest features plugging my computer into tv through d-sub ( 15 pin monitor ) input . though some care made so you don't accidentally set resolution something can't displayed properly tv . it pretty finicky when it comes what resolutions displayed unlike regular monitor . one other minor issue i viewing angle . tv doesn't come stand , so some thought put into placement this tv . optimal viewing , you want able eye level center tv . overall , i am very satisfied this tv purchase recommend it very good dlp solution those don't need 1080p or lot higher end digital inputs . edit - newer 61 " 1080p model ( hl-r6168w ) samsung might more value only few hundred dollars more prices posted amazon today ( 4.3.06 )	1

bought over 2 months ago , i've yet get tired this little piece ingenuity . i looking multi-usb hub got targus notebook chillhub because it hub plus those fans . hub it works great even when connected only my laptop those low-end attachments like flash drives , etc . if i need more usb power and/or want utilize fans cool my notebook ( which it quietly well ) , i plug ac adapter . granted it bit smaller than my laptop sometimes slipped when i moved it , but i fixed small piece two-sided tape one corner . even if it didn't ( or i didn't use ) fans , its good keeping laptop off flat surfaces so heat doesn't get chance build up more destructive levels . my only beef adapter ( hence 4 stars ) , which should unplugged outlet it still pulls power even when disconnected chillhub . when adapter plugged , it gets very warm even when fans not . i'm not too sure it'll last lifetime chillhub . i also don't like its shape -- its size it made too wide taking over next plug well . overall , though , i'm very happy my purchase , which , time , almost half price found staples	1
i never enjoy reading long reviews so i'll get straight point . idrops works but like all stratch removers it needs time many applications . 5-10 minor stratches , 15-20 medium , 20+ deep ones ... don't worry this bottle literally thousand applications ... cloth you use idrops very important ... i recommend eyeglass microfiber cloth ... 1.50 walmart ... i tried using soft tissue paper it actually added more scratches ... okay , actual process ... 1 . use 2-4 drops time screen2 . take your microfiber cloth slow hard pressure go across screen3 . this 15 seconds stop ( after time it starts dry up dry idrops actually starts sratch your screen)4 . its important remember when you redo steps again you use different part cloth cause dry part restratches it . okay now thats it , it seems bit nit-picky but hey thats what it takes . you might end up running out room your cloth apply idrops so just wash it hot water throughly wring it throw it microwave minute go it again . make sure its dry . it could whole hour before you finally finish especially deep stratches . idrops looks like it makes your stratches little more faded each time . well thats all i got . enjoy your new looking screen . god bles	1

these seem solid , honest speakers . they won't win any design contests . ( they look pretty solemn next my imac ) . very highest lowest may thin but , my use computer speakers , they fine . they more than accurate enough reveal difference various compression ratios . bass tight controlled . i see how these may not ' boomy ' enough some gamers . high-end lacking slightly my preferences but , sound not taxing ears . there minimal controls : on/off volume control bass boost switch . .... that it . i appreciate aux . input headphone jack . , i like not deal sub-woofer .	1
sandisk 4 gb cruzer mini sturdy reliable usb flash drive very reputable company . i've using 1 gb 4 gb over year back up transfer data various systems , no problems . drive requires no special drivers unless you using windows 98 . there green led base drive lights when it accessed . package includes 2 extra endcaps neck strap , drive ships 3 software applications installed . if you don't want use applications you just delete them recover small amount space they use . cruzerlock 2 data security software encryption , free version . i found its interface bit cumbersome , but it job . time-limited trial versions pocketcache ( backup software ) cruzersync ( outlook my documents folder synchronization ) software also installed drive . pocketcache some nice features , including tracking multiple history versions file , cruzersync makes backup email , favorites , etc . easier ; however version shipped my drive only works outlook , not outlook express . you find more information software going sandisk website viewing cruzer applications page . if you read more reviews net you'll find some complaints drive slow . there faster ones out there ( they cost more ) including sandisk titanium , but it never issue me . this drive compatible older usb 1.1 machines , still gives acceptable performance even speed . some people complain it easy lose endcaps ( 3 caps included ) . if you snap cap base while you're using drive , it lot harder lose . drives very sturdy - i accidentally stepped one without any damage . i've read two stories users accidently running drive through washer leaving it pocket . once it dried out , it worked fine no loss data . only negative point i've experienced if you want use neck strap , it difficult thread through eyelet drive . but bit patience , it doable , it only needs once . aware there lot counterfeit copies this product market . most negative reviews losing data , or drive malfunctioning traced counterfeit . sure buy reputable company like amazon or newegg , if you any doubts check serial number sandisk after you buy . i definitely recommend this drive , buy sandisk products again .	1

first product i ever bought razer one their copperhead mice . it expensive , but i impressed overall design quality product . i've mouse more than year now haven't any problems , even heavy use . when i heard razer branching out into pc audio , i naturally curious . so i decided pick up pair these headphones , their ac-1 sound card . again , they expensive but i felt i would makeup design quality . when i first opened box i found cord melted together few places , like wire insulator hadn't cooled properly before it rapped together plastic twisty . i also found if i pulled these bonds apart , they revealed bare wire . not good . so i sent it back , got replacement . when i opened second pair i found same thing , addition one fancy led lights not working . luckily , i able pull various bonds apart without revealing any bare wire . light still doesn't work though . i am , say least , disappointed razer here . i since read other reviews people complaining similar issues relating quality headphones . ( screws coming loose , volume control loosing responsiveness , etc . ) gamers particular tend use headphones hard don't appreciate when they " break " before their time . if i am going shell out much money headphones , i would like quality product reflect price	1

hp photosmart c5180 printer , hewlett packard brought market very good multifunction device great price point . although it doesn't seem part current hp product line any longer , it still great multifunction device deserves your consideration if you market new printer or multifunction device . you get lot features packed into one unit . printer scanner , there also set memory card slots accept most popular types digital camera memory . control panel features one touch access many functions , including copier functionality . small color lcd lets you adjust printer settings , make copies , configure onboard network interface perform basic photo editing printing functions . unlike any other printer i've seen before , hp includes some document " templates " printer memory . these templates let you make graph paper ruled sheets notebook paper . finally , there included ethernet interface , which lets you connect photosmart c5180 network use it multiple computers . out box setup easy . removing packaging tape inserting ink cartridges first time very straightforward process . inks click easily positively into place . when you've completed basic setup turned unit , you're ready start installing software connecting unit your computer . hp provides two options connectivity -- you use either usb or plug device into ethernet network . i used network connection . hp software found device immediately configured it no intervention my par t.t he included software bundle available pc macintosh computers . added bonus , macintosh version software universal binary -- , it runs both powerpc intel macintosh computers . hp software selection pretty well rounded . you get everything you need organize print photos , make scans adjust printer settings . i found software easy install able use it well within twenty minutes completing installation . if you use network connection , photosmart c5180 basic management web page used quickly check ink levels even perform immediate scan show up image your web browser . ink life excellent print quality very good . photographs printed this printer using special hp photo paper look just like professional prints hold up well handled . text documents not quite crisp those coming laser printer , but they still look very sharp clear . after printing several photos over 200 pages black text documents , only cartridge showed any drop capacity black one . all others still show completely full . unlike many printers , you won't break bank consumables . you buy all six ink tanks 150-pack small photo paper $36 usd . ink also purchased color , $8 usd per color or $12 usd black ink . this helps offset purchase price this printer . unfortunately , there some things not so great unit . starters , pc version software takes long time install . while stability intel version macintosh software nearly perfect , powerpc version didn't nearly so well . i saw lot unexpected crashes or applications disappeared outright , especially when managing photos my powerpc g4 mac mini . some people reported unit scanner not very good . scanner unfortunate tendency produce " noisy " scans , especially items lot dark colors . photocopies made using " black " copy button greenish cast them . i able solve this problem using " color " button copy black white documents instead . printer also moves very swiftly . this isn't problem much it notice caution . you should place unit only very sturdy table or desk , it moves quickly enough some printing modes it could possibly fall off or break what you've placed it . hp technical support could lot better . first one these units i purchased stuck " manufacturing mode " would not act normally . representative i spoke hard understand , didn't seem understand my problem couldn't offer any advice solve problem other than returning printer hp replacement . i returned it directly vendor instead . replacement worked perfectly every respec t.t his unit uses print heads separate ink tanks . while ink easily replenished , i saw no way replacing installed print heads . they look permanently installed , which suggests if they ever fail or become clogged , you may buying new printer . considering hp builds printers usually last very long time , this comes across me surprising decision their part . only time tell sure . finally , there some features i would liked see this unit . topping list would duplex printing module . some higher photosmart models this feature added . it seems like hp planned offer this c5180 well . internal web page " duplexer installed " field , back door completely removed . second would inclusion document feeder . network scanning functionality very handy , but it gets little tedious get up , walk across room change document scanner bed . again , higher end models photosmart lineup include this feature . all things considered , i find hp photosmart c5180 overall good product . it some areas where it needs improvement , but what product doesn't ? i don't think you go wrong this product , much what it very well	1

this ( it super cheap little brother ) some most hyped items audiophile land . i approached super-t skepticism : i mean it 10 wpc amp cheesy outboard power supply . how good could it ? answer very good indeed . my setup athena as-b 1.2 ( super cheap $99 speakers high 90db sensitivity ) , very good speaker wire ( straightwire maestro - yes it worth more than rest system - but it lying around ) g4 ipod losslessly compressed rips music forceful , tuneful , involving . this combo strengths jazz , female vocals , folk , pop , small ensemble classical stuff . hard rock orchestral stuff sounds little small . its zone competency very wide , however - within it bass rich great pace . trebles sweet extended . midrange lush tube-like incredible presence . vocalists sound like they're room i frequently stop what i'm doing ( system my kitchen - so i'm usually cooking ) listen - very good sign . this level musicality this price outstanding . this system blows away my mid-level system dynaco stereo 70 amp , nht model zeros . i swapped dynaco ( classic tube amp 35 wpc ) into kitchen system immediately noticed loss bass impact high end clarity i enjoyed sonic impact . caveats ? first all - it very low powered amp . means you must use very efficient speakers or it not bloom . second , your output only good source . make sure you use source great resolution or you're just wasting your time . i've heard you upgrade power supply get better sound . it wouldn't surprise me . this unit begs tweaked general . i attest it sounds great out box . this isn't true integrated amp . it offers only one input . only controls volume knob power button . me this ideal . you don't need pre-amp ! cheaper sonic impact amp doesn't binding posts ( uses clips ) plastic body smaller power supply smaller on-board caps . it also only $40 - but tweaking manditory unit . i think extra money well spent this one . considering sonic impact/athena as-b 1.2 system less than $250 rivals serious systems - i don't see any competition stay-at-home ipod system purpose-built ipod systems . cd/dvd player would also make excellent front end . this giant killer ? i don't know . i didn't put it up agains arc classic 60 my family room . i don't think it fair put $140 amp up against kilo-buck gear . sub $1000 price range it monster paradigm shifter - even given its limitations . if you listen right music - right ancillary gear , you not disappointed	1
i bought this phone used , ebay , 2 1/2 years ago . i lot reading before i bought it found there known issue battery life handsets . everyone mentioned battery life , there solution . when i bought phone , station 2 handsets $60 ebay . i immediately ordered 2 energizer er-p511 nimh batteries replace panasonic throw aways . i battery life problem my previous panasonic phone set , but , this set never dies ! my family talked hours single charge left handset few interesting places , only found again paging system plenty battery life . 2 hours talk time , it still shows two bars . voice quality not best , but , it not bad either . i use vonage no one tell i'm not traditional line . it definately better than any 2.4 ghz phones out there . range more than i need so i can't complain it . i go corner my back yard opposite side house base station experience minimal static . i've gone so far walk end our street ( cul de sac ) still enough coverage carry conversation , although it weak signal point . overall , i would given phone 5 stars if i didn't provide my own batteries make it useable .	1
based reviews this product , i purchased it . sadly , i now returned i t.t he pen simply could not recognize my handwriting . i went through " training wizard " , or whatever it called , teach software recognize my handwriting . i wrote slowly carefully formed all my letters better than i ever grade school . no matter . i writing block letters pen captured it really ugly cursive . i guess it couldn't tell when i lifted pen off page make next character . software said it could only recognize 48% my characters . so , i couldn't use any conversion software turn images into searchable word , pdf , excel , etc ., what captured io software itself extremely difficult read . verdict : useless me	-1

we received leadsinger kit last christmas really enjoyed it lot . my family ages : 50 year old dad ( me ) , 44 year old wife/mom , 12 year old son 9 year old daughter . everybody even more fun since getting " classic rock " cartridge because we know lot more songs original vinyl or cd recording reference when we want . only real drawback i think this , or any other " leadsinger " collections there no " master index " songs which tabulates all their collections . this would really help find what you looking , especially if you don't know classification leadsinger uses song . instance , it " classic rock " or hit " 90 " ? one other thing leadsinger could ( this minor ) package plastic case cartridge . cartridges small , not same size any other similar item ( e.g. digital camera flash cards ) , you no place store these leadsinger if your leadsinger mic full cartridges . fun	1
first , let me say i could not review this product completely it quit working after 20 scans ( 30 minutes after charging it first time ) . i chance perform scans 100 , 200 , 400 dpi well black white , 12- 24-bit color . i also able install software import 10 scans into my computer . it scan photos well ( both 200 400 dpi ) , but it tough get images scan perfectly vertical . higher resolution higher color ( 24 bit ) , scanning process took long ( 12 seconds full page ) . when scanning 200 dpi 12-bit color it took 8 seconds per page . also , scanner actually turns off after each scan , thus it takes 15-20 seconds button pushing reboot device before scanning page . importing 7 images device my laptop ( while it still working ) took 4 minutes . ocr software ( paperport ) good , but scan quality ( black white 100 dpi ) too poor allow it functional . 8mb internal memory not enough 128mb or 256mb expansion card definitely needed . what i most shocking very poor craftsmanship . there seams device where plastic glued . one two main buttons recessed into device . also , indicator lights misaligned overlying symbols . i cannot emphasize enough how poorly made this . i am returning it full refund ( 30 day money back 90 day exchange - if bought planon ) . not buy this product ! addendum ( april 20th 2006 ): i very difficult time dealing planon company . return this product within first 30 days get full refund , you must first get authorization which required no fewer than 7 phone calls 5 e-mails . once i finally returned it , they said they credited my charge when they never . upon calling them they said it would " take some time " see credit come through ... 6 weeks ago . they not return phone calls or e-mails order return this it required alot time effort . there business practices ( product quality , customer service , return policy ) poor best . i re-emphasize : not buy this product	-1

aluminum alloy way if you want avoid fan cooling your hard-drive . this well design very sleeks looking case . i seen lacie other external hard drive manufactures using acomdata case . firewire usb 2.0 more compatible older laptop like mine , which only use firewire slow usb 1.1 . yes there on/off switch , which some external too cheap put . there plastic grill front let air through . very easy setup big screws . one issue i noticed since using this case sound insulation . i got noisy seagate hard-drive slim aluminum case no sound insulation , which quiet loud time . my old western digital plastic case quieter hard-drive . so sound level not all fan , it also include hard-drive mechanics . overall it good buy .	1

i recently went through thorough research new phone system , going through research test purchases . main criteria : 1 ) good sound quality ( most decent cost ones okay ) 2 ) very good handset speakerphone quality ( can't stress how important this me , how different quality among brands/handsets ) 3 ) work voicemail ( like sunrocket ) message waiting indicator . if system answering machine it can't voicemail message indicator light . most other features pretty common across models/brands . battery life okay not great most 5.8 ghz systems . best phone i've 900mhz dss sanyo bought 1997 , but they stopped making or selling us . i wasn't looking cheap upto point price wasn't concern . winner : uniden 9465 . any uniden 5.8 ghz digital systems using tcx905 handset same , just different feature sets . i tried panasonic 5.8 ghz high end system , pretty close , handset speakerphone quality slightly worse decider . talking callerid seems like great idea but hopelessly badly implemented panasonic systems . talks too late , after 2 rings taks nonsensically most time . i'm getting classco 9900cw box see how it works . new uniden dect phone build quality atrocious . ge dect phone ( walmart ) horrible . didn't try others , including motorola	1

look price up there . this calculator sophisticated number-crunching gizmo handle 99% standard calculator use . need feature that not available ? good news , this fella programmable . it powers itself freely available light , but yet battery when lighting conditions paltry . its interface lovely thoughtfully conceived , it weighs less than your checkbook , it surprisingly durable : throw it around , let your aunt marge step it , rub it beef give it dog while ... end it'll still work . all , it costs less than pizza . back 1972 , hewlett packard released their hp-35 calculator ( four standard arithmetic functions twelve transcendental functions ) , it cost $395 . don't forget inflation , because translates roughly $2100 2007 . calculator changed world , now here calculator leaves hp-35 dust -- terms speed functionality -- less than 1/100th cost . sure , there lots feature-rich calculators you buy check-out line walgreen only few bucks , so you're probably wondering what makes this calculator so special . if you consider ( ) its price , ( ) its feature set , ( ) its overall utility , this calculator currently apex , folks . * long * way . its there several years . speaking calculator snob , i'm usually unimpressed anything less than classic hp , but far complete package goes , this calculator surprisingly beautiful . i own two them ; one keep my bookbag , one " just case " . this guy , you're getting lot bang very few bucks . it might not graph , it might not perform symbolic math , it might not use rpn or precision-engineered keypad double-injection-molded keys -- above all it certainly not computer -- but it currently best value out there utility scientific calculators nothing else comes close .	1

i purchased this radio week ago disappointed poor reception . my case , am reception poor . fm reception , built antenna ok , but , radio not go digital unless it strong signal . i recommend antenna like . crane ' fm reflect ' . after i connected crane antenna , fm better than my component fm receiver similar antenna . i am now receiving most all los angeles stations ( 45 miles away ) good digital reception . some stations offer three digital channels , i get those . kenedit added : i connected " terk technology am-1000 advantage passive am indoor antenna " this radio able get standard am reception up quality my other radios . note connecting antenna , connections appear polarized . if you get poor reception terk then switch wires around . sound quality even standard am best i heard any table top radio .	1
optical cable airport express makes huge difference sound quality when compared analog cable comes it . now i barely tell difference playing cd my stereo versus playing through airport express . it makes complete sense why cable would sound far superior : signal received computer airport express digital , if signal travels through analog cable it converted analog , thus losing some quality . optical cable lets digital signal continue all way through your stereo receiver . if you currently airport express hooked up your stereo , yourself favor upgrade cable , just make sure you optical input jack your stereo before buying it	1

i recently puchased this phone replace older uniden cordless phone . i've overall pleased uniden phones our home , so i didn't hesitate buy this one , especially since i difficult time finding white phone this price range didn't answering machine . i'm pleased quality reception . i've none clicking or static other reviewers experienced . sound rather clear . example , my husband called me today his cell phone rural upstate michigan , reception uniden phone excellent . ring volume tone good not annoying . my only complaint phone although it made go wall , it look bit strange . i bought this phone my kitchen , wall mount rather high up wall ( 6 feet ) . phone base small , so it doesn't cover entire mount like my old uniden . result , i only attach phone top hook mount not both mounting hooks , so i make sure it stays straight manually . also , it actually sits cradle , so phone base juts out wall . it not hazard our house , but it visually taking some adjustment could problem if your mount lower wall . also , my last uniden phone came normal phone cord short phone cord wall mounting . note this phone not come short cord . ** update ** - we've now this phone 4 months , i can't wait get rid it . if i talk it more than few minutes , sound receiver goes almost all way out so i can't hear other person talking . then it come back , go out , etc . we love our other uniden phone , but we're definitely getting rid this asap	1

i owned this projector almost year half . let start pros : its projector . it projects . i am using it 9.5 ft screen my bedroom . thats it section . now onto cons : within month , dvd player stopped recognizing any type media placed it ( dvd , dvd-r , cd ) . it not load . i own alternate dvd-player , i just hooked one up ignored problem , hoping would end my difficulties ( shipping back company repair comes out my pocket , eventhough its under warranty , not " television " watch period wasn't beneficial ) . next issue came head 8 months after purchase when turning it one day , motor ran very loudly ( noise-level you speak almost yell when sitting beside person which you conversing ) . color also seemed off ( reds appear muddy brown , image much darker without variating tones , i.e. naturally high contrast ) . this more than takes thrill out watching bloody horror flix . only source reduced buzz when using it computer monitor , but this still very loud , especially start-up . since then , this only way i watch my movies , through dvd-rom my computer projecting horrible image wall . my computer speakers also provide much better sound than built-in system speakers , which very necessary use order hear anything over loud buzzing ( if you close your eyes , you would think it chainsaw)the picture itself also very dim . i two narrow windows my room , both mini-blinds curtain , yet it still difficult daytime watch anything isn't bright cartoon . ( back my love horror movies , this causes dilemma)finally after saving up enough money purchase replacement , i am epson powerlight 76c shipped me . hopefully this projector last longer than optoma . i highly recommend researching other projectors before buying this one . just because it built dvd-player , don't let win you over . it just easy hook-up external dvd-player better projector . i purchased this 9.5 ft screen home shopping network 2200$ . talk pricey ! next time i won't so hasty purchase anything . this piece junk . try epson powerlight 96c . i researched read many good things this projector . it costs less , lumens 2000 , 1000 more than optoma , meaning you watch dark movies during day . hook up your own cheap $20 dvd-player . i guarantee you even cheapest dvd-players last longer than this system built-in one . go quality not cheap hooks	-1

i given zune gift , recently . this isn't first mp3 player i've owned but it one largest capacity store data i've owned . up front i'll tell you i'm not hardcore ipod junkie , nor am i apple kiss-butt . i believe products work . said i see why people prefer ipod over zune , though i say zune isn't deserving some bashing i've read these boards people who believe it cool bash microsoft products just because they made microsoft . good1 . zune large , bright lcd screen easily seen sunlight . video picture quality good . 2 . sound quality good . factory earphones adequate delivering music though i pair philips earphones far superior only cost $20.3 . box includes data cable you need syncing . 4 . interface super easy use it easy get around zune environment i've not any music skipping problems 1.3 firmware automatically downloaded when i synced my pc . 5 . unit itself feels solid when held , slightly heavy though not too heavy . 6 . software loaded without problem my winxp sp2 system i no problem syncing machine when connected usb port rear pc . i all my non-itunes songs added player within minutes . 7 . zune allows you beam songs , pictures movies other zune players range . first generation player , it gets job nicely i look forward seeing what generation 2 bring . not so good1 . when i connected zune 4 port usb hub pc didn't recognize it there . i connect it back pc usb 2.0 port order get it work . maybe that design , though i'm not sure . once i this i no syncing problems all . 2 . i've never found zune range share anything . leaving wireless seems drain battery faster . i'd recommend turning this feature off until more people buy zune ( if happens ) . 3 . you can't buy music or movies wirelessly . 4 . although zune wireless it not compatible your home or business wireless lan . 5 . you can't browse internet zune . 6 . zune software no problem getting your music onto device , though zune marketplace vastly understocked compared itunes music store . 7 . zune cannot get music purchased through itunes ( this nitpicky , i know , but would so nice ) . there way work around this - you burn your itunes songs disc then turn around rip disc pc mp3s then import them zune , which i would rather than pay money re-purchase music i've already bought once . 8 . there no way re-organize files your zune once they uploaded device . say example i want throw couple pictures into picture folder so when i view my pics i don't scroll down forever day see them . i delete pic zune through pc software , add pic folder i want then sync pc player . folder added zune library order update occur . 9 . there no way change orientation photos or movies when viewed . i would like able flip them counterclockwise or clockwise 90 degrees view them portrait view instead turning player its side view landscape mode . one reason why this important when i set one my pics my zune background , i'd like able see just how much pic cut off since zune doesn't resize pic fit . oh yeah , that thing ... 10 . pics used zune background don't option re-sized fit screen . what i would like see change zune ( more microsoft than anyone else)1 . options re-sizing pics fit zune screen2 . options changing orientation pics movies3 . ability organize my files zune without delete file re-sync . i'd like able this player software both . 4 . since i use usb port back my pc longer sync cable would nice . 5 . put built-in wireless good use . slap compact internet explorer allow viewing web pages email ! you don't need keyboard view read-only content like weather , news sports it would really add player value6 . allow zune able buy music , pics video without connect pc . again , make use wireless capability zune . 7 . something zune marketplace - it just needs overhaul . it needs additional music , movies definite bump cool factor . 8 . make it easier customize outside zune . you this additional customizeable faceplates xbox 360 - same this player . if you hadn't noticed - individuality here stay	1

if you looking ipod alarm system this your machine . reviewer comments good sound quality mark . but it one serious design flaw least how i wanted use it i'm returning mine . i thought it dual ipod/radio alarm system , advertised . it not . radio alarm only second alarm , apparently second sleeper . you cannot select two options . tried work around setting second alarm go off first but you can't not set ipod alarm so when it ( or buzzer ) goes off it shuts down radio . can't understand why they couldn't worked around this issue but beware if you want choice flexibility what you wake .	1

i've this keyboard little over month . i'm college student purchased ppc so i carry my notes important dates , information , etc my pocke t.t ypically , keyboard , intention using ppc notebook , necessary . pro pretty much pinxet mentioned , there not much i add . however his cons somewhat ... insulting intelligence hp customers . bt_kb comes off button . same button you use turn it turns it off . further experiment this , if you press it once , establish connection ipaq then press button second time pop-up appear informing you keyboard disconnected . also , if you press button twice then your ipaq search it , it not find i t.t he little lock keep keyboard flat , pinxet mentioned , useless . " / " button ( also " ? " ) curiously placed right shift ( normal qwerty keyboard it left shift ) . so if you use forward-slash or question mark frequently you adjust your writing get used unusual position key . ( where " / " would normally you fingers type up-arrow key . so what ultimately ends up happening , when you want type question mark , you hold down shift , press up , highligh one line text continue typing removing line text . fortunately ipaq word processor comes undo function . ) my only other concern i seem problems connecting keyboard my cell phone . phone identifies keyboard establishes connection , but beyond i can't seem get keyboard type anything . students anyone intending use ppc pc ( perhaps pocket laptop ) , this keyboard priceless . i use it four five times day . ( such , i would highly recommend purchasing two pairs rechargable batteries it . next time maybe hp built lithium battery , like all other accessories electronics	1
this radio design excellent - solid , well-crafted feel ; easy hold when cranking dynamo ; simple useful controls ; easy-to-read analog tuning dial . reception both bands clean very stable , this radio locks stations other radios cannot . sound clear full , much better than i expected small radio . few minutes cranking produces hours listening , i like buying fewer batteries . i originally envisioned this standby radio emergency use , but i find myself using it around house whever i want listen radio . i heartily recommend sangean mmr-77 superb radio great value	1

average going price this product $50 . -$60 . price quoted herein $600 . so far beyond what might considerable reasonable it ludicrous . doesn't amazon any standards their third party vendors ? whether or not you disclaim responsibility third party suppliers , they appear amazon web site , nothing prevent amazon associated such chicanery . allowing such postings unworthy amazon . number years i held equity position amazon , fully understand , generally approve using additional sources products your customers want , i understand meaning caveat emptor , but this embarrassment	-1

i've my pmc-120 little over 1 month am pretty happy it . there few features microsoft could improved : user customizeable eq , more than one playlist created device , last playlist recall when returning music ( video or tv ) . overall unit functions well great taking all my media road me . once windows media player configured my pc , all my synchronized recorded tv content converted background before i wake up morning . before i leave , i just plug sync minute or so i'm good go . only other nit-pick i would processor or i/o performance seems issue when loading album cover tracks . example , if i change next track increase volume , volume response take 2 - 3 seconds while album cover loaded . this little irritating sometimes when i want skip through several tracks . spite this , i like unit i'm happy it . maybe ms/iriver provide firmware update address lack features above	1

i just needed small inexpensive radio good stereo headphone jack listen work better reception than my iriver music player this guy fit bill perfectly . amazon carries suprisingly few compact fm radios digital tuning aren't garbage . no matter , this exactly what i needed . reception far better than my music player , even antenna unextended , battery life phenomenal . i've this few months , listening it average few hours week i am still my first pair batteries . my only complaint it others noted , tuner volume knobs hyper-sensitive . full range volume barely audible too loud occurs over like eighth rotation knob . fine tuning stations chore because it go 101.10 mhz 101.15 mhz pretty much just breathing it ( it 0.05 mhz digital tuning resolution ) . since tuning knob side , it gets budged slighly every time you remove it included sleeve so you need re-fine-tune it receive your station everytime you take it sleeve which gets kind frustrating . overall quality radio many features belie its low price . four stars based its fm tuner capability alone	1
excellent price ! tiny 1gb holds lot music , pictures documents . just click drag . fast data transfer speed . super-easy use . lanyard keeps it ready .	1
this amazing value . i all set purchase same system ebay when i checked amazon . not only price low any listing auction site , but it included shipping no cos t.t he system very well packed . someone put lot thought into getting this product china my house without damage . setup breeze . no need get your kids show you how connect speakers . well thought out . calibration process using enclosed microphone positively excellen t.t he sound overall very good . probably not up bose , but then consider cost differential . my one complaint disk changer . loading more than one disk verrrry slow . so slow i thought system defective . drag out kid figure it out . this why i gave it 4 stars instead 5 . cocolalla , idah	1

when shopping external storage , i wanted something not only provided lot gb my dollar , but would also provide redundancy . after all , external hard drive no more reliable than internal drive your computer , i've far too many hard drive crashes lost data it happen again . this device perfect combination . raid 1 configuration , each unit two disk drives contains exact copy data , so if one fails you need only replace one drive rest easy , because data safely stored secondary disk . i also read western digital send out replacement drive so you replace it yourself , eliminating need send your precious remaining drive some factory somewhere . just keep mind this configuration , you only 500 gb storage since both disks contain same data . i also wanted triple interface . i couple macs firewire 400 ports , i pc usb 2.0 . someday if i buy newer mac it may firewire 800 , this external drive ready them all . it took only minute install software my mac book pro , most time spent doing reboot ( unfortunate drawback , first time i've ever reboot after installing new software ) . noise : there lot negative comments noise , but considering all benefits i went ahead took plunge . boy am i pleased decision ! there brief power-up fan noise when device first connected power , but after it whisper quiet . i type this review , i'm middle moving 20 gb old files drive there no noise whatsoever . there few drawbacks too . marketing literature promotes unit capacity meter built into led indicator . you must drive connected computer driver installed this feature work , making it mostly worthless my case ( where i connect multiple computers , some no drivers installed ) . sometimes drive goes sleep upon long period inactivity , takes 5-10 seconds wake again . this minor annoyance , but nowhere near deal breaker . here my positives negatives : pros- great amount storage price- raid 1 means no more lost data- wd offers advance replacement failed disks- triple interface offers excellent flexibility- whisper quiet , aside brief power-on fan noisecons- capacity meter mostly useless- drive sleeps long inactivity wakes slowlyconclusionoverall i would highly recommend this drive anyone looking external storage built redundancy great price . i feel 100% confident knowing my data properly mirrored digital content ( which i invested money ) also safe years come	1

after looking months head unit would handle satellite radio ( xm or sirius ) well am/fm , cds , ipod , i finally located this remarkable little device . ipod link everything you could expect short clickwheel ( or multi-touch , iphone announced few days ago ): you search artist , album , song , playlist , well second-order searches ( songs within albums , etc . ) . or you use direct search function , which each six preset buttons takes you through 1/6 your music library -- push 1 you go 17% way through , 2 = 34% , etc . very convenient . display software sensible flexible , so you customize readout all functions . hint : if you want whole titles songs instead limited-character readout , redefault song-title display scrolling right left . sound , even factory speakers , just great , again all functions including ipod . you can't half well anything else	1

i just took over 500 pictures this camera while i trip europe . i learned lot it process . it some nice features : it lightweight , durable , easy plug remove zaurus , it really impresses people . you store thousands pictures 480x320 resolution , or ten thousand 128mb sd card . downside , it drains battery quickly , picture quality varies so-so fairly bad . camera unusually picky lighting level - it poorly low light , also poorly mixed bright/dark lighting . if you get lighting right , it take " acceptable " pictures . if you're kind person cares picture quality , you're not going like output much . if you're like me , just taking [ inexpensive ] pictures stick your homepage , it works like charm . i'm glad i bought it	1
