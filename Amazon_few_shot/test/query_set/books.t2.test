i've seen word " macabre " used lot reviews eugenides first novel , i think it appropriate , but all its darkness this certainly novel heart . bleak cynicism its portrait middle-class cluelessness ( community inability understand or care its teenage daughters ; flailing , insincere attempts " deal " tragedy through therapy both official inofficial memorials untimely death ; flimsiness individuals ' concern their neighbors , 20th-century american suburbs claim " neighborhoods , " through which desperate sense fear self-preservation constantly breaking ) balanced uncharacteristic tenderness teenage boys who observe five doomed lisbon sisters unrequited longing closest thing this lifestyle offers true love . i read eugenides second novel , middlesex , while ago , enjoyed it very much , but i think i liked virgin suicides better . i trying explain what i liked better it , fumbling how middlesex sprawling narrative-oriented this weirder somehow something other than story , but it won't quite give up what , he much better job articulating what i trying say : " it sounds , " he said , " like virgin suicides modernist , while middlesex victorian . " duh--that exactly it . then this morning , i came across interview eugenides ( his onetime student , jonathan safran foer ) , which he says , " i always say it like this : my generation writers grew up backwards . we weaned modernism only later read great 19th-century masters realism . when we began writing high school college , it experimental fiction . i think now certain kind academic experimental fiction reached dead end . middlesex postmodern book many ways , but it also very old-fashioned . reusing classical motifs fundamental postmodern practice , course , but telling story isn't always . i like narrative . i read it write it .

reading dark harbor like watching mediocre tv show you can't bothered turn off . i listened dark harbor audio book , so i don't feel too badly wasting my time it because i `read it ' while i doing other things anyway , like driving . if you looking something feels fresh new - dark harbor not you . this novel innovative episode murder she wrote . illustrate : stone barrington his cronies quickly deduce apparent suicide must murder because gun found victim wrong hand . ( i think i actually saw one murder she wrote ) woods either can't bothered come up new idea or he simply doesn't care . it clear early who responsible murders dark harbor . this isn't because clues come together any logical way , but rather because predictable nature novel . you just tell . this doesn't mean solution makes sense . fact , there huge inconsistencies plot make ending feel forced . it if woods couldn't bothered think all his plot lines through . woods compelled include his regular characters novel even though they little ( except course , sex stone ) . holly barely says word her first trip island . her second trip she obligatory romp stone then gets kidnapped remainder novel . why she kidnapped ? i don't think anyone - including woods - answer question any plausible way . my theory woods needed work holly into plot decided putting her peril would allow him fill few pages . it also allowed him include holly dad ( regular character ) her search . wood motive seems obvious . kidnapper motive however isn't - her kidnapping makes no sense . but clearly this something woods didn't think worth worrying . best i say this novel it quick easy read ( course , my case it read me ) . it may not worth time trouble actually read ( certainly not buy ) - but audio book library ( limited selection audio books choose ) it helped me pass time traffic .	1

i just read princess goblin this evening , it wonderful book which i highly recommend . this book , george macdonald , masterful story teller ( note : he not necessarily good writer , but he good story teller ) , tells story irene princess . irene embodyment innocence , macdonald book , innocence hero . not only story iteself imaginative just plain good reading , but it also point , something which many today fictional books seem lacking . point summed up something irene grandmother said : " seeing not believing : seeing only seeing . " i think george macdonald trying provide picture faith . we not believe blindly , many existentialist postmodernist church members would tell us , irene see feel string which guides her , well her grandmother . however , others , who not yet faith ( curdie ) cannot see or feel line until they believe it . effect , macdonald saying we cannot see feel ( metaphorically ) god directly until we believe him . notice , however , while curdie could not directly see string , he could see effects string . he saw evidence string existed , then he later concluded since he saw evidence string , he should believe string grandmother who gave it . then , after believing , he saw string . this very good picture conversion it should . one first sees evidence god , whether through lives christians or through arguments , or both . then one believes , only after one believes one really " know " god . macdonald " good " ( good , not his well writen books ) much better than most authors ' . . . lewis himself said george macdonald portrays good better than any other auther he knew . . . lewis ' good kind somehow , more powerful fierce , though no less loving , kind , compassionate . all truth , i prefer . . lewis ' incarnation good alsan macdonald irene grandmother , but both extremely good . somehow it seems irene grandmother not strong one would like good though . conclusion , fact george macdonald managed take topic faith , wrap it rich garb childrens story , it adored world amazing feat . i am very much looking forward reading sequel , princess curdie , which i hope very soon	1

i've this book little over month now am 20% way through . book nothing but problems , 1125 all , clear diagrams highly accurate solutions algebraic notation . goal book build up your recognition tactical patterns . achieve this , problems annotated not motif , but difficulty . goal work through all problems relatively quickly . if you get stuck , look up answer move . general problems progress difficulty , but patterns built up working earlier problems help solve harder ones later . marking difficulty allows one decide when " give up " look solution , unlike reinfeld book example , where you never know if you simply blind , or you've hit one really hard problems . this book no hints ... no " spot pin " , no " white just opened position , why this mistake ? " . so general practice it little more realistic . this book not explain motifs . if you want , try nunn " learn chess tactics " or one similar books polgar , littlewood etc . these books also better if you find you weakness particular motif want practice just one ( my favorite here , muller " chesscafe puzzle book " ) . key , though they not labelled such , problems organized motif pattern . you move through problems you come across series closely related positions . example , you might get 10 back rank mates row , then 10 knight forks . i often find i hit first these , struggle bit ( though usually first series one easier ones ) , then second one quicker because pattern starting establish itself , so . so book really contain " hints " , but my experience discovering pattern yourself cements it more than it explained then exercising series examples . me least , this approach seems work better than classic reinfeld books , " sharpen your tactics " replaced them my bedside	1

forget wagner , whose disgruntled cacophony posing music nicely dispatched oscar wilde one his plays comparative quip when somebody rings old disturbingly noisy doorbell . forget wagner because birth tragedy greatest work art criticism ever written . it also , despite print century , underexplored gold mine artists intellectuals . this nietzsche first book : it contains en ovo thoughts this great writer thinker who formative influence heidegger through him derrida , two greatest post-nietzschean philosophers . nietzsche great theme infinite possibility opened up greek culture 6th century b.c. , time heraclitus birth tragedy-the culture spawned not only democracy science but which , like brood many eggs only some which hatched ( or quantum possibility before measurement " collapses " wave function into reality)-much more besides -- culture beside whose tragedic productions ( aeschylus sophocles , not euripedes , whom nietzsche shows lost touch essence tragedy ) modern cultural productions not only not measure up , but often seem best , nietzsche says , like " caricature . " loss art traced nietzsche itself-well , not tragic , no-less than tragic : sad let us say . not only highly creative artist-like philosopher , but multilingual philologist who read ancient greek original , nietzsche beams his laser-like analysis astounding clarity into this lost realm possibility . it if he stuck bookmark into tome time , showing us very best part otherwise often dry rather bad ( perhaps overly long ! ) book which we collectively author , called culture . what crucial emphasize nietzsche conclusion ( or assumption ) ( its most famous line ) " existence only justified aesthetic phenomenon . " thus ancient greek tragedy not just random subject , or one art form among others . it aesthetic experience par excellence , greatest overcoming perils existence into worthy production art humans ever developed . nietzsche links success aeschylean sophoclean tragedy brief fruitful intercourse ( like men women , which keeps new people coming despite often-fractious sexual relationships ) two aesthetic strains . one he identifies greek messenger god sun , apollo , other dismembered god wine , dionysos . dionysos also not one god among others . rather , it him all ( originally religious ) tragedies devoted , nietzsche tells us , when other actors appeared sacred precursor greek stage they not taken realistic but avatars , idealized other versions , dionysos . now most crucial thing realize dionysos " he " split into pieces his split pieces represent fundamental , contradictory , fact universe : although all one ( borrow philosophical truism ) this one split into many . this primordial splitting ( cf . heidegger distinction individual beings ) , according nietzsche , regarded ancient greeks itself ur-source human suffering . dionysos tears came mankind , his smile gods . now nietzsche says apollinian aesthetic strain manifests clarity dreams-which show discrete-although ultimately illusory-images . these images similar those appear before chorus ( crucial tragedy but dispensed euripedes ) , before spectators , form actors tragic spectacle . thus tragical spectacle displayed shows itself dreamlike illusion culture , not representation reality per se . just , after we stare sun , we see spots before our eyes so , nietzsche says , after we stare into abyss we see tragedy its chorus ideal human characters . dionysian element nietzsche identifies drunkenness dissolution , opposite clarity dream imagery , made public greek stage . dionysian sense represents one , or movement individual ( seen la schopenhauer vedic metaphysics mayan illusion universe " i " itself ) back one ; apollinian illusory clarity skin-encapsulated individual . ( nietzsche own individuality , brain , compromised treponema spirochetes , real dionysian avatars syphilis eventually killed him . ) one most fascinating things nietzsche exquisitely crafted analysis way it shows science , no less than euripides , motivated socrates ' false humility dreams total knowledge . " who this demigod ? " nietzsche asks socrates-whose reign reasonableness , passed plato , aristotle , church scholastics-defines much modern world . socrates created secular tradition , raising knowledge over aesthetics giving mysticism bad name . nietzsche points out plato burnt his plays after coming into contact his teacher-and compromise , platonic dialogues , fact prototype new , socratized art form-the novel . thus , startlingly nietzsche suggests novel itself debased form art-a euripideanized , socratized attempt make primal aesthetic experience more representative , reasonable , realistic . euripedes ( he later recanted , but his influence went ) dispensed tragic core stagecraft , today we accept drama individual characters all their oddity imperfections-rammed us unremittingly hegemony plot wordy deus ex machina explanations aesthetically poisonous , hyperrationalistic aftermath euripides socratic capitulations . sum , today we all but forgotten dionysian origins acting-more real than realism-which originally centered around not fleeting emotions empathy , but central cosmological fact individuals tragic separation all . highly recommended	1
if you wish read something entertainment sake , then this book suffice . written english professor , this book lacks sort critical thought those us science deptartments want . purportedly ' abbreviated history western manhood , ' it rather exercise academic arcana - attempt think something through its opposite or , this case , its abuse . one hardly compelled reconsider ideas what manhood means . there nothing taylor " treatise " support such nonsense , " this specter haunted men centuries : fear manhood become , or already become , obsolete , superfluous , ridiculous , best quaint , worst disgusting . " really ? whose misandrist manifesto ? concept " western man " , after all , just - concept . there no such unified homogeneous group no such " specter " haunted it so long . men should cringe word castration less mystery than than why women should fear rape . short , taylor analysis history purposes castration sheds less light " cultural construct masculinity " than sadistic sexual abuse humiliation which males threatened subjugated . some his readers find him witty or funny times only because taylor treatment his subject often sophmoric . my view , today attitudes toward manhood males best understood terms our lacking moral sympathies toward them . taylor book no exception . we not generation influenced freud so much feminism . thus , historical abuse mutilation women subject deadly serious pertinent us while sexual abuse humiliation men treated like something never happened - , something we've misconstured , or , tayor case , given fictional reinterpretation , mocked trivalized . taylor ignorant belief ( not first person , course ) sexual prowess eunuchs one case point . case point tayor view most western history castration mark power divinity , ultimate abrogation sexual desire , wide spread currency among christian metaphysicians . this nonsense . taylor arguing anecdotally his own foregone conclusions . he wasn't there take any polls . no doubt , some christian cults managed appropriate practices sexual mutilation already place - just christian nihilism helped make slavery seem worthy . this not , however , make such practices any more agreeable hardly anyone wanted suffer either condition themselves . any case , spiritualized feelings attained some christian monks through self mutilation would appalled greeks - paragons western civilization - it most men throughout all human history . taylor book castration score few points concept cultural relativism subject now seems , best , uncontroversial or , worst , comic immature . should he chose write volumes exploring gamut humanity attitudes regarding every other form sexual nastiness , he no doubt find endless tolerance feted well . would he dare ?	1

this definitive work impracticality , impossibility immorality socialism . von mises , who observed socialism first hand before flee his home europe , who lived through age great collectivist experiments , written simply devastating critique . ( supposed ) reader below who wrote review entitled " propogating utopian fallacies " , obviously either not read book , or completely misunderstood entire thing . more ignorant review this book hardly imagined . he makes several dubious assumptions his review attributes them von mises . he makes statements like , " mises doesn't understand , " or " mises believes " then proceeds use these statements try refute idea free markets . he also fails apply his own logical excercises himself . example he states if mises consistent , he would rejected all government not just some collectivist programs . yet reviewer seems believer half-way system where markets mixed socialism , " democracy " , government intervention . i guess he must monopoly believing governments should some things leave others anarchy market . anyone familair rest mises works free market libertarian theory general can't help but laugh claims he makes . this reviewer clearly not understand property rights based , modern anarchist theory ( opposed rage against machine variety which he makes reference ) , nor he understand this book . claims he makes last paragraph his reveiw so outlandish naive they not even warrant response . important lesson gained here though . without some prior ( correct ) understanding concepts like markets , anarchy , liberty , true nature government , without some understanding logical processes , it easy fall prey such overly-simplified arguments . i would recommend this book , also reading other books authors such mises , murray rothbard , henry hazlitt , f.a. hayek	1

i highly pleased read loeb lee batman : hush . artistry rivals japanese manga story line rich internal detail . reader exposed ( me first ) insights batman mind . throughout story , we know what he feeling what he worries . there times , however , where internal narration gets way real-time events . example , batman fighting same panel , he thinking someone else . hush good story new batman fans , though . loeb new readers favor explaining new old characters albeit some may find practice boring . catwoman also need some development . much i found her intriguing , i'd like see more justice-seeking catwoman , catwoman who fights so ardently weak cannot stand see injustice prevail . also , i would disagree few reviewers regarding plot twists . maybe they meant bring many dc characters into story possible , i found this practice entertaining . it new thing see old villains used new ones show how easily old villain insecurities weaknesses exploited . this approach made old villains appear more human than plastic characters we so used seeing televised batman series . ( before you rip my head off , batman series come long way , so don't think i consider batman villains plastic they not so cartoon series they 1960 television series ) . bottom line : great read , nearly masterpiece . it easy new batman fans become acquainted this fandom since new old characters explained . we also exposed inner workings batman mind , slight oversight frank miller batman : year one , however annoying times . catwoman character bit limited her saucy flirtatious ways , though she not fail amuse . above all , great read well worth time .	1

rawls nozick responsible reinvigorating rights-based liberalism 20th century , saving political philosophy mere in-fighting among utilitarians , superstitions marxism . political philosophy since largely response rawls nozick . this work genius , though it frequently misunderstood , perhaps purpose . most readers , including important philosophers like thomas nagel , simply misunderstand argumentative structure , result many famous criticisms book irrelevant . nozick thesis minimal state justified , but more than minimal state cannot , except under unusual situations . part i book addressed other libertarians , specifically market anarchists ( also called anarcho-capitalists ) . such , nozick assumes libertarian rights self-ownership ( or self-governance ) . basically , nozick wants show market anarchists minimal state arise without violating anybody rights , where rights question things all parties debate agree we . so , he describes scenario which security companies come inevitably natural monopolies over geographic areas . after providing highly original analysis nature risk its moral implications , plus hugely important discussion side constraints moral prohibitions , nozick establishes such monopoly would legitimately prohibit other security firms independent enforcers operating its area , provided it compensates everyone involved . most natural form compensation free security . nozick then argues equilibrium occur which security all provided analogue coercive taxation . end this section , nozick , provided argument successful ( there good reasons think it not ) established agency provided court , military , police services geographic area arise without violating rights without explicit intention creating state . very common misreading nozick occurs here . many philosophers think nozick believes only state arise this manner this form ( security company private shareholders ) legitimate . nozick didn't think this isn't committed it . instead , what he believes he shown both minimal state desirable ( it would arise unintentionally result spontaneous order because it superior market anarchy ) legitimate . nozick then say this leaves open whether state democratic what way . second part book meant challenge arguments more than minimal state . it also misunderstood , even very smart people . nozick not assume libertarian rights part ii , though he refers them times . instead , his argument consists three factors . first , he primarily addresses egalitarian liberals ( hereafter e-liberals ) . e-liberals believe rights personal freedoms ( sexual activity , etc . ) justified , but hold economic activity controlled government decree . nozick examines e-liberals reasons wanting more-than-minimal state ( such welfare state or social democracy ) , debunks them drawing analogies economic activity e-liberal would regulate personal freedoms e-liberal desires leave free . if e-liberal cannot identify morally salient difference , she forced either deny personal freedom , thus becoming authoritarian , or admit economic activity should remain free , thus conceding nozick point . style argument used part ii what i call " liberal presumption " argument . liberal presumption any human activity ought remain unregulated laws unless some strong reason shown regulate activity . ( this contrasted against authoritarian presumption , which mussolini stalin held , namely any activity ought governed unless strong reason shown let it free . ) nozick addresses e-liberals , who hold liberal presumption , then attacks reasons they offer support regulating various activities . he shows reasons based misunderstandings bad arguments , thus restoring liberal presumption . last type argument not rely this presumption . nozick addresses marxists , instance , who not liberals . his arguments against them consists mostly just showing what wrong their position . instance , marxist exploitation theory crucially depends upon bad economic theory , such labor theory value , something which shown false back early 1870s . ( almost all contemporary economists would agree nozick this . marxism smart people what creationism dumb people , pseudo-science . ) result these arguments show more than minimal state cannot justified . way , part ii , nozick provides us some gems . he gives first major critique rawls . critique devastating , nozick points out mistakes rawls reasoning ( simple logical errors , etc . ) leave rawls ' project ungrounded . rawls , some reason , never responded this critique . nozick also analyzes envy , provides hypothetical histories arrive more than minimal state uncover its nature ( it logically equivalent system which we all own parts each other ) . he also sketches theory justice holdings contrast rawls , dworkin , others . this theory , entitlement theory , very rough , but it provides welcome alternative simplistic theories maintaining all there justice establishing patterns ownership . part iii least often read least understood part book . partly , it provides contractarian argument libertarianism ( see loren lomasky article david schmidtz ' book , robert nozick , contemporary philosophy focus ) . it thus contains some foundations nagel claims nozick lacks ( though this criticism based nagel mistaken reading . ) part iii , nozick asks us try construct system allows experimentation which everyone , despite their differences , find society allows them live out their conceptions good . system best approaches this libertarian framework , inside which non-libertarian communities may established provided they respect other , different communities . part iii sketchy , but contains seeds brilliant things , it too bad it hasn't explored more . overall , i would say argument part i weakest , part ii strongest , part iii most interesting ripe philosophical potential . if you care political philosophy , you owe it yourself read this book . you also owe it yourself understand it . if you find yourself thinking nozick making dumb mistake or begging question , you've misunderstood . but you'll good company	1

i rated this book " two " relation other koontz books i read . book entertaining enough , but not very unique relation other books koontz written . koontz appears somewhat formula when creating main charachters . often there primary charachter who appears rather basic beginning , but through later description becomes more complex due unusual background . koontz books often aforementioned charachter utilize their unusual background overcome difficult obstacles usually order save loved one . i believe koontz tries express certain generalties , some which moral religious undertones : end , good overcomes evil often evil its destructive nature , destroys itself . love worth fighting dieing . love stronger than evil . what not kill you , makes you stronger . evil knows no socioeconomic boundaries . key happiness love , not material gain . evil lurks where you least expect it	1

franken well-known political journalist america . this book billed funny , but after i got it ways , i decide better word hilarious . franken uses humour bring out points he making while exposing political economic mismanagement other misdemeanours -- even some felonies way . this first book i read franken . he known primarily his journalism , since 2004 , his travelling radio talk show politics current events . this book provided extensive laughter , arising american political situation , always productive source humour satire . other side evil nefarious underbelly washington , corruption , dirty tricks , outright lies - not officials people -- power trades ignore weak powerless . author uncovers big deals powerful people purposely rip off american indians under guise getting them favors washington . likewise american mariana islands , bilked no less than america family man house speaker tom delay . franken manages make his points laughter while providing extensive documentation every area he deals , starting fomr presidential election 2004 . his jewish humour enhances his insightful satirical commentary american politics . self-proclaimed liberal , he provides particularly entertaining portrayal right-wing bush administration shenanigans related cronies factions . he discusses details some most unbelievable programs dishonesty dirty tricks history . i especially liked sections discussing how money certain gambling interests one state used fund church-led opposition gambling interests state . franken provides extensive documentation lines details relationships some greatest corrupt politicians washington prominent " religious " leaders like ralph reed " christian coalition . " amazing shocking , even beyond what we already could see suspicion freely public information . franken also compiled large body material related iraq war . one very interesting aspect well-documented trail plans bush administration invade iraq , before 9-11 . plan actively discussed british least early july 2002 , year before public plans made after us congress un discussions . administration insiders report administration discussions invasion possiblities early january 2001 . note this before 9-11 . actually minutes diplomatic meeting 10 downing street us uk officials published uk press discussed widely . extensive subterfuge misdirection characterizes bush plans iraq invasion , even after detailed us international evidence , there no tie al qaeda baath regime sadaam hussein . they find other reasons invade . but invasion goal , all they needed excuse . it not we didn't think these things happened , but here we it lined out heavily documented detail . it sad commentary administration whose rhetoric followed line clean-up , honesty , interests people family values . no wonder prestige credibility usa plummeted bottom under bush administrations . every american ought read evidence presented here , not just entertainment , especially when baldfaced claims right-wing [ so-called " conservative " ] media moguls provide such astonishing absurdity . but we appreciate here excellent documentation provided this conscientious patriot journalist awaken world real situation . challenging , but rewarding read .	1

yourself favor - don't waste your time this book	-1
i rarely glad finish any book i this one . it vitriolic diatribe long allegation short substance . author wellknown extreme leftist this book just more same . he hates george . bush , republicans , business people , americans general . this really nothing more than poorly smear job all kinds people mr. moore despises . it extremely poorly documented . moore uses some footnotes chapter one , but not use any throughout rest book . even footnotes he use based upon dubious sources . included among those several books written bush haters . he even cites al jazeera source . i quite surprised i didn't see national enquirer listed among his ' reliable ' sources . some moore rants so contradictory they really quite pathetic . one section he claims osama bin laden unlikely planned or directed 9/11 attacks . he said bin laden dialysis cave afghanistan ( must some cave . bat cave perhaps ? ) just few pages later , moore incensed some bin laden relatives allowed leave united states after 9/11 attacks without questioned fbi . i am wondering why they would need questioned since moore so convinced bin laden didn't direct attacks . he thinks saudi arabian government it . yet part book , moore gives us his ' plan ' getting things back track . his first item listed ' catch osama bin laden . ' why ? moore doesn't think bin laden 9/11 . why worry him ? absurdity moore rantings his claim media biased favor iraq war . i don't know where he getting his news but it sure isn't abc , cbs , nbc , cnn , washington post , new york times , or any other establishment press . moore also thinks most terrorists ' homegrown ' united states . evidently he hasn't followed current events last 30 years . excluding timothy mcveigh , moore would hard pressed list any other ' homegrown ' terrorists . yet spot , he carries long time saying there no terrorist threat . he claims any concerns terrorists just manufactured bush administration excuse violate rights everyone world , keep himself power , etc . very bizarre position moore takes this book his advocacy his ideal presidential candidate - oprah winfrey . while i'm sure she very nice person , she seems like odd choice presidential candidate . she talk show host . should she not selection , he thinks tom hanks would great choice . again , i'm sure he very nice person , but not how we pick presidents . this one position alone shows moore not serious commentator or worthy his views considered reasonable people . i could go inaccuracies this book . suffice it say , it merely rantings extreme partisan who little regard truth .	-1

i've just read through couple other reviews here ( which i sometimes ) i say i agree some more nasty reviews , though i disagree their conclusions . parker really disciplined writer , someone who writes fast ( reportedly he 20-25 pages day , now , three books plus year ) cleanly , without almost any extraneous plot or characters his work . he back form lately ( apaloosa very good ) this his latest spenser book , part what got longest running series detective fiction these days . they can't give him any more awards ( i think they made him grand master mystery writers guild or whatever it decade or so ago ) so he just soldiers , putting his grandchildren through harvard piling up cds . what makes book good one points where i agree some reviewers . i don't particularly agree susan weakness series : frankly parker portrayal spenser , what made character unique early , he * isn't * loner . departure chandler , hammett , ross john . macdonald , all other private eye writers up 60s . idea one those writers character permanent relationship almost inconceivable ( exception hammett nick nora charles , but they only thin man ) so parker breaking mold when he . it also generally agreed almost splitting detective character twain adding hawk alter ego spenser brilliant . this book avoids both those plot conventions parker , many ways more traditional book , though course setting even plot much more contemporary than any above-mentioned author books . plot rather pretty much standard parker . there school shooting , somehow one shooters got away . other caught , gave up his friend . grandmother second boy very wealthy determined , hires spenser look into matter , prove her grandson innocent . spenser , course , can't prove anything sort , but he try find out why whole thing happened , something cops can't determine . i enjoyed this book great deal . i said , it somewhat more characteristic earlier works , but i think if i read book without spenser or any other names it , i still would able tell who author . writing style very distinctive	1
i asked this book because i thought it would give advice how raise daughters -- it -- more . dr. northrup begins explaining how mothers daughters connected through generations , how we only create healthy relationship our daughter when we heal our relationship our mother . we heal ourselves , we heal all women who gone before us . this only sample some insight she offers into our relationships women . i'll admit i surprised holistic approach she takes , but am glad she offers insight , i'm only vaguely familiar some ideas/theories believe i more grow area . rather than book geared towards raising children ( i've read my share -- i thought that what this book would ) i would categorize this book self-help book geared toward strengthening creating healthy relationship your mother daughter . very pleased everything i've read	1

i enjoyed this book but not much halberstam great " summer ' 49 . " book yankees red sox , " october 1964 " takes you through yankees ' cardinals ' respective seasons , regular focuses individual players , scouts , managers owners . title , then , bit misleading , you don't get october world series until near end book . that fine , except whereas " summer ' 49 " two teams fighting each other all season long al pennant , " october 1964 " follows two teams two different leagues , who didn't face each other until series . halberstam evident intent present two teams contrast : rigidly conservative , declining yankees opposed young , hustling , racially integrated cardinals . it almost works , but end it like reading two separate books - chapter or two cardinals , then back yankees , cardinals , yankees , etc ., until end , when they finally take same playing field . gives book bit disjointed feel robs it some intensity " summer ' 49 . " still , portraits personalities involved engaging , reader gets good feel state professional baseball circa 1964 , making this must-read any lover baseball history	1

i tried embrace this book -- i really . it tempting want last found piece academic writing deftly encapsulates explains this clash titans : jihad globalism . barber main title , however , more tantalizing than explanatory . this book demonstrates dangers allegiance dichotomies ; there other forces work society grapple headline-stealing titans . this important book least insofar it captures growing sentiment among academics interested socio-economic forces compel current events . it not , therefore , easy read layman ( particularly last part book ) which ironic given his call grassroots citizen action . barber asserts -- really insists uncomfortable brand academic arrogance -- almost narrowly political overtones world immersed battle opposing ideologies : corporate , amoral homogenized one really without ideology local , or tribal , rigidly moral fragmented one part ideology , part myth-making . unfortunately , his earnestness construct defend his convenient dichotomy , he conforms exceptions his rule . jihadists -- whether ethnic hatemongers or terrorists -- barber retained some residue moral dignity while globalist -- whether gullible , materialistic indifferent consumers or manipulative , multinational executives -- altogether lost their moral compass . his solution ( which he fails outline , thus making his work more polemic manifesto rather than manual change ) activist citizenry fully appreciative their need ability shore up civil sector modern societies . here again barber remiss , revealing writing one desk rather than field its limitations . he fails acknowledge , example , extent which lack civic tradition such nations russia china impedes social progress sort he pines . following further indicates his lack awareness chinese cultural resiliency : " what striking even here where native culture might thought its greatest chances against children western enlightenment , mcworld seems irresistible .

sadly , wright throws up facade his evangelical readership early christian resurrection stories should taken literal historically defensible . should we expect anything different someone socio-religiously tethered his own conservative community market ? wright foists upon his readers technical propaganda aimed certifying myths his modern western religious tradition . his often grossly dishonest use primary literature characterizes his overt , evangelical program book . this work not open historical inquiry , but apology sold his already deluded market . one redeeming value work wright surveys large array ancient literary sources , so one gains substantial list primary references investigation . if , however , you wish read far more balanced work topic , might i recommend . riley resurrection reconsidered . riley true classicist scholar nascent christian traditions , not traditionalist or apologist . evangelicals somehow still get away same ploy . idea goes something like this : larger my book , more erudite authoritative it its reception ( e.g. bock commentary luke larger than pacbell phone book ) . let honest one thing . wright not produced this volume larger scholarly world . he plainly written work insulate his own evangelical market realities found careful investigation question tabled . since most never read 1000 ancient works ( their original languages ) required even weigh his argument properly , evangelical world becomes falsely satisfied wright dealt matter handily .	1

most reviews i written amazon based books , dvds , cds i already own . i occasionally buy new product via amazon , but i mostly review stuff i already own . i own this book ... this play because i read it while humanities course college . i went college rather " late " life ... whatever means ... yet i derived more experience than i probably would i gone right after high school . i am one those people who believe it not college makes " well-rounded " indivividual , but life experience . if colleges universities handed out degrees based life experience , i'd probably doctorate three times over ... we given assignment reading this play seeing live production college i attending just so happened putting . my primary focus philosphy , i embraced existentialism unit we now focused upon . my best friend , who was/is " atheist " less receptive these existentialist ideas he considered strange elusive . you think he , atheist , would more open them than i who already bitten metaphysics/spirituality plague . truth told i think only reason he says he atheist because he cheapskate doesn't want shell out extra money christmas gifts . so we go see this play people getting pretty agitated . this play everything goes round round but never arrives any final conclusions i noticed how we , society , love our answers . we not soothed questions proposistions " what if ? " scenarios . we feel need latch onto something because something better than nothing . isn't it ? existentialists believe universe random , chaotic , ultimately meaningless so sense they " give " meaning meaninglessness . just like atheist believes non-belief . you see , human species cannot not give meaning his/her life ... we cannot not believe ... we " pretend " life without meaning we don't believe but everything falls onto screen our perception , take shape our perceptions . i loved this play . i loved merry-go-round type dialouge . isn't this what we all ? we get belief so engrained our heads we think it only way believe so we spend lot time trying convince someone who may not receptive our point view why it valid . what i learned over years only reason why belief valid because we ones who validate it . it doesn't make us " more right " than person who doesn't believe it , it just makes us believers belief . contrary popular opinion , more people you who also believe same way you believe not prove it any more valid than if only one person believed i t.t his play not dissolve me into puddle desperation futileness , fact it added more meaning my life which would probably make samuel beckett gag . it made me fall love even more this crazy life only i live . nobody lives proxy . each us liberated imprisoned our beliefs . best we ever hope determined what we willing believe any given time . this why it good practice sit down journal your beliefs time time question why you still believe what you believe . you may outgrown certain beliefs , certain ideas , certain ways world but don't like two " bums " play , don't keep postponing what it you eventually desire see ; see it now , live it now , it now . if you going atheist , best atheist you . if you going christian , best christian you . if you going anarchist , best anarchist you . just don't think everyone going believe exactly you believe don't make others wrong simply because they may point view . end , none us truly know what other side . yes , we've people near death experiences , but nobody ever come back after completely dead report , we just reports people who " mostly dead " . take life grain salt enjoy ride . peace blessings .	1

you ever get impression author trying just little too hard get attention their librarian readers ? i don't think this happens much world adult literature , but when it comes kiddie lit , writers sometimes verge shameless . now i willing look past kimberly willis holt paean glory librarians everywhere " part me " , non-fiction true tale librarian heroism , " dear miss breed " joanne oppenheim could certainly slip my watch . but recently i've doubling back rereading some children books came out early 2006 . those books , one i missed early game richard peck , " here lies librarian " , courtesy dial books . mr. peck written wham-bam , rock `em , sock `em tale hard core drag racing librarianship . though still better ( anyone who reads his books regularly tell you ) than 92% schlock printed yearly , peck latest venture carries it faintest odor familiarity . basically , if you perused enjoyed his previous book , " teacher funeral " , then there probably little reason go this title well unless you like regularly douse yourself peck pleasant wordplay . quite while now it just peewee jake , jake peewee . two siblings inseparable since death their parents together they've managed cobble living themselves out small automobile body shop . year 1914 small town indiana peewee jake anxious new paved road pass their miniscule business venture . while they wait , jake working like madman create his very own automobile so enter it one county drag races . then four librarians sweep into town everything goes goofy . you see , these aren't just any old librarians . led irresistible irene ridpath , these woman shake this sleepy little village upside down , managing way help jake his dream , aid peewee ( real name eleanor ) live life she deserves , defeat maniacal dealings no good rotten kirby brothers . hilarity ensues . actually , i'll level you here . lot librarians warning me off this book , if its less-than-perfect status relegated it lowest basement dankest library . it happens , i enjoyed it quite lot . how could i not ? you've got corpses dangling trees , independently wealthy librarians , mention pierce arrow ( car i've loved since i read " cheaper dozen " lo these many years ago ) , chills , thrills , spills , gal winning drag race backwards . peck writing just great . who else comes up descriptions like , " my flesh felt like moss bait " ?. or one less than fully intelligent villains , " his knuckles dragged ground thoughtfully " ? or oblique reference vulgarity peewee saying nasty group people , " more horses laughing . or parts horses " ? wink wink . peck comfortable his time periods , whatsoever those time periods may . that part difficulty comes reading his books . loathe include glossary terms back ( which , fair , i don't think single child reader ever consulted day their life ) he kind expects you know what " step-ins " , " clabber " , or " truss " might , amongst other archaic words phrases . yeah . so pandering your library base may not crime any sort ( " i wondered if there wasn't library science course scheming " ) but it always makes me just touch suspicious . i think " here lies librarian " quite lot fun , but i'm not entirely certain how many kids would actively seek it out . i guess just remains seen . any case , it definitely fun read . not peck strongest work , certainly , but great book get you through day . if you just happen mlis degree your own then it feels just much more familiar .	1

this book written engaging fashion younger readers , so that why i gave it 2 stars . but i found attitudes conveyed towards slavery , native americans , democrats unsettling . i think there some political motives behind this book . i think author trying indoctrinate youngsters into ultra-conservative southern republican political ideas , brand christianity makes people outside church ( you know , other people god loves ) think christ-followers hateful crazy . example , p36 it states , " although it true native americans often treated badly european settlers , they treated one worse " " we cannot feel so much pity native americans when we think all this . " they it coming ? they faught killed each other like every other group humans planet , so we shouldn't feel bad injustices perpetrated white european settlers natives never recovered ? two pages deal slavery , it mentioned slave trade profitable traders , but " hard slaves " who shipped colonies " under difficult conditions . " bit understatement . , subject civil war , " many people south not own slaves , but they knew how quickly southern economy standard living would damaged if northern politicians forced southern farmers immediately free their slaves . " yikes , what slaves ' standard living ? no where it mentioned or even alluded slavery us bad wrong . it not okay own human treat him or her like animal ( or worse ) . reason north abolished slavery ? they machines work slaves , so slaves became obsolete . i quote , " ... why slavery away northern states . reason primarily northern businessmen not need slave labor operate their stores factories because they made much greater use new machines cut down amount hand labor necessary complete job . " no mention how compassionate christians ( others ) vehemently opposed way slave owners viewed , kept treated their slaves , or what they abolish slavery . finally , treatment democrats republicans really unbalanced . only things mentioned carter ? how horrible he establishing relations china , he messed up panama canal , his debaucling iran hostage situation . " short , our country sunk new lows during carter years . " clinton claims fame creating huge government against constitution people ( who promptly reelected him ) , meddling bosnia other war-torn nations , promoting homosexuality , monica lewinsky . ( why these last two issues book 9-year-olds ? ) contrast , repubs get only positive press this text . finally , book also says p178 , " sadly , our country supreme court ruled 1962 it illegal children pray public schools . " that not true . law pertains adult-led corporate prayer , but nothing prevent child praying school . if this book line your political views , then you might want buy it . but i hard time believing anyone this day age thinks slavery really not such bad thing . reason , no one should it . this text could supplemented something more truthful regarding slavery , like parent-censored version " slave narratives , " which records hundreds interviews former slaves their lives slaves after emancipation .	1

this one awesome . i followed series inspector banks books dry season onward this one probably best so far . part reason protagonist , alan banks got fixed pretty good previous book -playing fire . this story starts him still recovering all psychological physical wounds he incurred previously . you follow his struggles through his attempt coming back place where he normal again , well rebuilding his home well his relationships his co-workers , especially annie cabbot . story then forces him re-establish or re-evaluate his relationsip his younger brother , evidence their relationship hinted throughout previous books , but this book places relationship front center . robinson once again uses his signature plot device : dual story intertwining twin narratives . whereas previously robinson used this device tell two stories which related philosophical sense , this time two murders intimately related inextricably become same investigation . robinson builds plot line tempo narrative brilliantly . this time , he little more guarded his storyline so he doesn't telegraph ending much he playing fire , which makes much more satisfying ending . this particular my personal favorite out series so far just because it involves so many emotional changes characters story line so personal banks . robinson also started flesh out other detectives eastvale , giving them points views , foiles , strengths weaknesses . it makes me care lot more story it also makes story much more complicated real	1

i rely heavily amazon reader reviews plan my reading list , but i'm going respectfully disagree this . here what i think happened : judy goldstein read " devil wears prada " " nanny diaries " said " hey kids ! let re-write these books but pediatrician point view " then she thought every funny case she ever seen exaggerated it , changed names . then she thought some ridiculous plot allowed her show off her extensive knowledge fancy boutiques hamptons . now i nothing against good chick-lit , but there nothing this book . heroine * so * perfect , i found her unbelievable . actually goldstein seemed afraid include any characters weren't basically amiable ( ira goes gambling sponsored coke binges ? how eccentric ! ) even bird quirky . there so many random threads this book : receptionist chemo loses her hair , well obviously then she going focus all her attention her opera kids cd , never mention cancer again . someone suggests shelley loses few pounds poof ! she goes diet she loses 30 pounds . oh fran templar party ? let run around looking her then drop it all sudden because we remember she not actually character this book . usually i'll give any book 100 pages , if i don't like it , i'll put it down guilt-free . however i felt compelled finish 24 karat kids simply so i could write this review . i'm not going ruin highly predictable ending but it seemed me like author looked book , said " ooh look 200 pages , i'm now ! " typed final 3 page chapter tied everything up	-1
this book suggested me professor ( preston allen , author fine novel hoochie mama ) , whose opinion i respect very much ; thus , i continued reading even when i felt overwhelmed emotion ultimately rewarded story really two stories . mr. banks perhaps finest writer i ever read , his prose refined point almost too self-conscious . he master making reader feel his characters . so i followed main character northeast miami , he fled his boring life found himself more trouble than he knew possible . first story , surface story , works because rich writing some semblance plot . haitian american , i serious problem second main story ( especially because banks ' fine style ) , claude vanise story . i wept . it fiction , but i wept . i remembered how i came here small boy . i remembered what happened my mother , but i won't go into . i angry because mr. banks not haitian . i kept waiting him get it wrong -- there some stereotypical things , but they minor . this story i kept wishing someone would write . both haitians cubans see miami haven poverty political oppression their countries , but america usually sees only cubans deserving refuge . i am still bit bothered banks not haitian , but selfish reasons i wish every american would read this book . i number it among my favorites all time	1
i've enjoyed inspector banks series past ( particularly " final account " which great twist last few pages ) , but " innocent graves " all talk very little pay-off . banks himself continues interesting character , robinson writing never less than superb , but this particular mystery big " who cares ? " me . mystery itself isn't really much mystery its solution more blind luck piece evidence just happens appear , like deus ex machina last moment , than it any brilliant deduction banks part . " innocent graves " seems far more interested psychology suspects ( one particular , whose story concludes all too predictable fashion ) than satisfying its readers great solution crime . i've always found this kind mystery bit bore ; give me couple corpses some brilliant twists i'm happy . there couple corpses here , but no twist ; just far too unbelievable uninteresting ending	1
originally published " buddhism tibet , or lamaism " 1885 ( w.h. allen co ., ltd ., london ) , this classic , somewhat controversial , book gone through several title changes , including very accurate " tibetan buddhism : its mystic cults , symbolism mythology , " when reprinted dover publications 1972 ( currently print , , handsomely produced volume very reasonable price , my personal choice . ) kessinger edition , reviewed here , follows one reprintings under original title . it its time landmark english-language writings tibet , it still retains some value its rich visual documentation , form photographs line drawings . ( unfortunately , kessinger editions not well-known such contents ; reports suggest individual copies their editions differ quality . ) there some remarkably clear descriptions shrines temples , costumes ritual practices , objects images . given massive destruction tibetan religious sites china well tibet , much what he recorded never seen again . unfortunately , author all too frequently confides reader his distaste religion he describing , his contempt its functionaries . i gave up book this reason when i first tried read it . some amazon reviewers ( responding other editions ) seem think waddell must known what he talking , accept his characterizations face value , which pity . part this attitude may self-defense . it seems waddell got access some his information becoming owner/patron tibetan buddhist temple peking , probably felt he make clear his pious readers back home england he not really wicked idolater . some his expressions disdain seem reflect real misunderstandings : failed grasp word " lama " means " teacher religion , " not " monk , " he scandalized discover occasional married lama . ( this response probably relates intra-christian issues well -- see below . ) then , too , there idealized image theraveda buddhism ceylon , which introduced itself europeans true , pure , original , non-superstitious buddhism , not confused those self-styled buddhisms found elsewhere . vision standard purity , versions found northern asia would automatically seem defective , waddell takes it granted . ( it should remembered mahayana , or " great vehicle , " versions buddhism , like tibet , tend refer theraveda teachings hinayana , or " lesser vehicle . " ) finally , waddell , apparently writing solidly " anti-papist " readership , sometimes seems unable distinguish images rituals mahayana buddhism , its various forms , parallel practices catholicism , glad condemn both . worth reading today ? well , book still cited , diffidence , scholars far more sympathetic subject , far better informed it , its extraordinary amount factual documentation . novice tibetan studies , i would suggest starting solid introduction , like snellgrove richardson " cultural history tibet , " those looking further information might continue responsible modern study , such giuseppe tucci " religions tibet . " you could probably turn waddell details after reading either one . those interested " sampler , " i point out waddell published 1894 similar , but much , much shorter , volume ( under 200 pages ) sikkim , " lamaism sikhim " ( his spelling ) . this long out print , but adobe reader pdf book made available set free downloads , due warning waddell biases , part bibliography section " himalayan art resources " himalayanart.org . it might helpful check out " waddell lite " before deciding bigger book . whole bibliography there may helpful , too	1

it interesting note this not very good book . after considering novel premise , one would think it would prove entertaining any mercedes lackey books . lackey , author who developed exacting balance necessary romantic fantasy , writes here her new five hundred kingdoms universe , which , fairy godmother , so sly , ironic engaging . encouragement seemed cemented quick skim through first few pages , which established characters her sophomoric effort those reliable archetypes lackey perfected . princess andromeda acadia , kind generous heart shines through her shy , bookish exterior ; perfectly flawed heroine . andromeda antagonists her mother , queen cassiopeia , queen adviser , both whom demonstrate lewd ambition most lackey most effective villains . they plot cheat princess andromeda her rightful place ( one reminded , often , lackey subtler black swan ) , andromeda finds herself allied unlikely champion surprising love interest , summons within her strength fight back against traitors crown . this brief synopsis , reader determine there nothing groundbreaking one good knight . not necessarily fault . but what one slowly comes understand this , latest variation lackey perfected formula , its utter lack charm . lackey seemed unable find herself slightest enthusiasm any her favorite constructions . her villains laid manipulative traps heroine , only them forgotten shortly after . reasoning behind most characters ' actions never developed . aimless descriptions dragged her heroes drifted together , seemingly without real motivation . time romantic thread story clumsily resolved , one could only stare , wide-eyed , what could only most falsely bland conclusion lackey ( or any author outside romance shelves ) ever wrought . how could any author genuinely enjoy her characters still lump them together so indifferently ? passionless union two couples , not mention utter confusion " climactic " battle , leaves reader perplexed . his confusion not aided what may most mediocre final line ever span paperback page . there no argument : this book neither original nor well-written . only place where opinions may disagree whether this novel misstep , not growing trend , mercedes lackey prolific career	1

i no comments this particular translation republic , it only version i read . republic not live up its namesake . " socrates " says ( i think we all know socrates really just plato play dough after book 1 ) close book 9 , vision kallipolis only " exists theory " or perhaps there " model it heaven . " earlier differentiation theory practice make it clear plato only intended use kallipolis model human soul . therefore , suggested policies eugenics , infanticide , communal property , holding women children " common " probably not taken seriously . plato himself predicts inevitable unraveling such city . after reading republic second time , it occurred me it little more than self-help manual . reason should rule spirit passion . " dabbling " weakens character . understand difference necessity luxury . shatter your illusions what you think you know , etc etc . not these not important , but such ideas not require complex analogy totalitarian society . thus , i think republic slightly overrated . most compelling portion this book , my opinion , critique various constitutions . while critiques oligarchy , tyranny , timocracy democracy map nicely individual soul , they also make logical sense independently . while convention led us disregard former 3 constitutions , democracy often placed pedestal most ideal form government . plato challenges this notion succeeds vigor tearing down this pedestal . democracy , even its representative form , not much more than tyranny majority . we witness democracy inherent flaws today u.s. , issues such abortion gay marriage . this , my opinion , only significant thing republic offer modern political theorist	1

owen wister " virginian , " first published 1902 , considered many exemplify american western novel . wister certainly established code west , stereotypical figures tough but genteel courageous cowboy , ( one wearing white hat riding white horse ) , spinster schoolmarm back east , horse rustlers , corrupt villain beyond redemption . fact , novel contains scene constituting first known " shootout " american literature . our narrator easterner , man who visits judge henry , virginian employer , his ranch sunk creek fairly frequently . i came think him mr. wister himself , who travel wyoming parts west extensively . my perspective , virginian , whose true name never revealed , anything but stereotype , although many heroes modeled after him . yes , he tall , dark handsome . this description not terribly distinctive or unusual . one could definitely call him strong silent type , he marked sense honor , loyalty justice . however , born raised virginia before civil war , it realistic assume he instilled values southern gentleman . although he not manor born , his family decent hardworking , one certainly not need wealth live good book . war veteran longtime wanderer throughout western territories , he learned survival skills his mid-twenties . loose lips not desirable trait if one wanted live long healthy life . i found virginian credible character , flawed like all men , but clear unwavering sense right wrong . he man suited his environment his times , personifies rugged individual . it important note period which this novel written fully enjoy it , just it crucial understand times setting which such authors charles dickens , jane austen george eliot wrote . " virginian , " wister states : " it through declaration independence we americans acknowledged eternal equality man . it we abolished cut-and-dried aristocracy . we seen little men artificially held up high places , great men artificially held down low places , our own justice-loving hearts abhorred this violence human nature . therefore , we decreed every man should henceforth equal liberty find his own level . this very decree we acknowledged gave freedom true aristocracy , saying , ' let best man win , whoever he . ' america word . true democracy . " believing this so strongly , it any wonder character virginian created ? miss mary stark wood bennington , vermont , who calls herself spinster age 20 , she woman ahead her time . many created mary image , but she original . intelligent , independent , adventurous , full pluck , yes , pretty , she sets off teach school bear creek , wyoming , get away family pressure wed unwanted suitor , probably see more world . acquaintance correspondent miss wood , mrs. balaam , bear creek resident , wrote told young woman teaching position . mary accepts , it happens , virginian first meet her upon her arrival . he actually rescues her , primitive stagecoach she traveling mired-down creek - driver drunk quite irresponsible . she later embarrassed , remembering how tightly she clung cowboy , fright , not out flirtatiousness . he , however , cannot get her out his mind . this so much more than romance novel , although there romance aplenty , both classical nature kind man courting woman . virginian bete noir evil character named trampas . two clash throughout tale until final showdown . one books classic lines our hero responding trampas after nasty insult , " when you call me , smile . " he also betrayed trusted friend who becomes corrupt out greed weakness . law order not arrived wyoming territory it up individuals maintain civil society . mary wood calls this taking law into one own hands , or vigilantism . this issue becomes bone contention herself virginian . owen wister imbues his characters , especially virginian mary , remarkable sense depth . their relationship , well his relationship his old friend steve , depicted particular poignancy . initial reserve mary her suitor normal period . however , sexual tension them palpable . graphic love scenes not necessary here . author more kiss embrace than many modern writers accomplish all their erotica . there some terrific humor also . i found emily , hen , one most original animals fiction absolutely hilarious . wister vivid passages describing wyoming wilderness extraordinary , making it easy one visualize gorgeous landscapes . pace somewhat slow times . however , i not find narrative all tedious . time passed more slowly back then things took longer accomplish obvious reasons . this difference demonstrated way tale told . " virginian " voted western american writers 1977 greatest western novel all time . whether it or isn't debatable , but i really enjoyed it . this 100th anniversary edition max evans contributes new fascinating afterwards . highly recommend . jan	1

i'll start admitting i not read complete , unabridged , six-volume set winston churchill " second world war " . i read condensed version , which still mighty tome , twelve hundred pages small print . book fascinating many respects churchill certainly unique powerful prose stylist . you can't help but struck his phrase-making . where others might say " .. it great impoortance .. etc . " , churchill gives us immeasurably better " .. it highest consequence ... etc . " there no doubt churchill singular personality , but one reads into his account wwii , one can't help but wonder whether it true man never suffered moment self doubt , never wondered whether he making right decision ? churchill writings once criticized " triumph public over personal " it must said there some weight . only glimpses one regularly given into churchill mind his expressions frustration alarm when people disagree him prefer not take what him obviously correct path . before entry us into war , he only frustrated disagreements his military commanders he could fire them , e.g. wavell auchinleck ( churchill only really admired attacking generals it clear caution not one attributes he particularly admired ) . after us entered war churchill obliged cede considerable amount control americans , he frequently overruled his views how war should prosecuted seems , each instance remained convinced rest his life he right it terrible shame he didn't get his way . he never admits wrong anything makes one question fairness his accoun t.t he other remarkable thing this history complete omission any reference concentration camps or hitler " final solution " . friend churchill buff suggested me this because churchill embarassed not known anything camps until nearly end war but cannot correct . what strange thing leave out what intended definitive history ! all all , these great books required reading anyone who wants thorough knowledge wwii , but they seem me written man unable keep his eye off his own place history , however much he may wanted write straight factual account one defining events twentieth century .	1

first word rule st. benedict ' listen ' . this rule , composed centuries ago benedict community , continued communities across world this day , powerful way living into fullness god grace love . however , title this text esther de waal indicates , it not always easy rule , nor one immediately grasped completely understood . monastics oblates benedict orders take vows , typically poverty , obedience , chastity conversion life ( oblate vows modified reflect reality living outside enclosed monastic community , but vows derivative same root ) . it last vow , conversion life , perhaps heart this book . conversion this context not once-for-all , ' road damascus ' kind experience , but rather daily decision continue working toward new kind life . de waal first chapter deals healing - we live broken lives broken world , not just physical well-being sense . using images biblical texts such garden eden cross , prayers st. anselm text st. benedict , she weaves ideas healing , wholeness , fullness even we recognise our short-comings brokenness . god accepts us who we each point , but calls us perfection we never really attain . if this seems like paradox , you're something . next chapter entitled ' power paradox ' . monastic movement always its heart paradoxical call individual ( latin root word monastic mono , meaning ' one ' or ' singular ' ) context community . christian call world but not world , resist world yet work within world , such paradox . de waal illuminates several such paradoxes , including primary christian paradox cross , both image death life , defeat victory . ' paradox ' sometimes considered fancy word contradiction . benedict rule seems full contradiction , just life seems many times . benedict looks today primary focus activity energy , but also looks forward future most important . benedict requires life service others practice hospitality , but also emphasises need solitude withdraw world . de waal explores through rule benedict what it means live oneself , living others community , living world , both together apart . each person endowed gifts graces , potential us see christ them , if we attentive (' listen ' ) lose ourselves we might also christ-like sake others . contradictions de waal highlights include difference desert marketplace ( early desert fathers never quite removed world they might wanted ; marketplace not ' unholy ' or ' ungodly ' place necessarily , st. paul often his teaching while plying his trade tent-maker marketplace ) . whichever avenue taken , desert or marketplace , de waal emphasises necessity prayer anchor - de waal uses example thomas merton , man solitary prayer also completely involved world large . saying ' yes ' call benedict , live spiritual life , live life tensions contradictions , never simple intellectual assent , but rather one come complete person , body soul . it recognising paschal mystery both folly wisdom , recognising ourselves always repeat yes . according de waal , echoing idea conversion life ongoing task , one must say ' yes ' every day , repeating the'yes ' asking blessing each night , passing task oneself others constant basis . de waal reflections not simple easy . small-format book , if one reading words alone , text could completed matter hour or two , but this would lose richness benedict ( de waal ) insights images . this book longer-term meditation , read lectio divina , read inspirational guidance , taken small pieces like rich chocolates , savoured appreciated slowly full experience .	1

after bought first edition read numerous other finance strategy texts ( addition graduated mba finance ) , i think it fair say this grinblatt book rather superficial its coverage technical matters e.g. options , financial engineering etc . poor its treatment real life contemporary issues e.g. , bankruptcy etc . plus i still can't see what it got corporate strategy . something still missing here .... most write-up kind basic ( i.e nothing oustanding ) explanation issues , concepts or techniques finance , which you easily find other texts much simpler names . title this book catchy but misleading . priced $120 , this really rip-off . i just don't understand how other commentors could give 5-star this " shoddy " piece work . reference manual corporate boardrooms wall street ? come ! you guys must joking ! no offence but this what they'd call " cutting edge " ? compared classics like copeland " financial theory corporate policy " or slightly less-advanced brigham " intermediate financial management " , this grinblatt book really falls short standard needs lot catching up . hopefully , authors take serious note this their upcoming edition . unless course , they still want their book just " appetizer " business undergraduates .... short , not worth buying . never judge book its cover or this case its rather appealing title	-1

licensed private pilot i often dreamed doing just what author , i.e. rent vintage airplane , take whole summer off fly around entire united states . so , when i saw this book i bought it immediately settled vicarious thrill . unfortunaely , author describes almost no contact local people only passing mention scenery he flies over . his mission apperars simply touch down every state then fly next airport ; mission accomplished . he lands , goes nearby restuarant , hamburger ( quot ; it goodquot ;) flies . there many writers out there who traveled usa motorcycle , car or boat ( see william heat-moon quot ; river horsequot ;) managed write fascinating account their adventures . this book very cut dry left me wanting more . maybe someone take same trip some summer write book worth reading	1
