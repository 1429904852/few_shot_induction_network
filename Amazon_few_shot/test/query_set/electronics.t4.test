i no problems burning these discs , its when i went back few months later these discs found out none them work anymore . after further research i found out memorex uses cheapest dye available thus dvds absolutelly no life them , my discs started dying after few months . addition , you physically hold disc your hands you feel how warped physically it become . this true all discs ( 150 them ) . i not not recommend this product stronly enough !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-1
this worst purchase any type computer hardware i ever made . it felt very light flimsy , definition cheap plastic . not just construction but performance terrible . it would work perfectly half hour then go break nothing 10 minutes . this very very frustrating . maybe i just unlucky received defective one , but i wouldn't take chance again . i wish i could give this device worse rating , somewhere around -4 would much more appropriate .	-1
luckily , i didn't pay penny motorized skipdr . it given us " prize .

player stopped working after only few months - it would accept dvds but not play them refuse eject them . behavior started out intermittent , but it finally gave up ghost swallowed dvd never let go . we take player apart just get dvd out before throwing player away trash . our previous dvd player lasted over 5 years before it started skipping . this one lasted less than year before it stopped working altogether - what waste . save your time money buy machine	-1

ok .... i bought one these refurb thinking it great bargain ... hey 5gb less than $100 what deal . once you get hang loading working windows media player its not big deal load . unfortunately after it begins locking up not recognizing songs ( which requires drive reformat reinstallation songs ) you get really good it . it 4 months before it stopped even recognizing hd no longer worked all . i thought maybe reason i bought refurb so new one better ... right ? so i stupidly bought brand new one .. again less than $100 . this one now begun lock up reload problem within 2 months reciept i just recently got " not recognizing hd " message . i am hopes getting it work but right now its just expensive paperweight . i am 0/2 these players so i don't believe they worth shipping it takes send them back . beware this product	-1

i purchased this because i lot math online hoping i could use this purpose . also i hoping able use it taking notes . so far , i'm not impressed . pen crummy little plastic thing not very satisfying use . it actually very uncomfortable -- particularly when you consider you press very hard get your entire note set recorded . talk writer cramp!i'm also disappointed you can't write it it instantly displayed computer interactively . my fault not understanding functionality better but i thought this could double writing tablet . i can't speak size paper since i haven't tried any other size . general , big disappointment 90 dollars i would better off just setting fire ! item destined craigslis t.p.s. -- reviewer who wanting handwriting recognition -- my pad come trial version package would convert text . course , very limited use since stooopid thing failed capture my handwriting accurately first place . but capability there ..	-1
product shipped me moscow . after first charge , i took it university where it powered my notebook two hours . upon returning home recharging device , i discover it not turn anymore . i suspect battery charging led indicates this it connected ac power . however , disconnecting it any power source , it appears ac outlet usb ports no longer function . device gives no auditory signal or led message , so i don't know if built inverter out or something else wrong it . either way , i'm left dead device never supported charging 45 watt solar panel anyway . i strongly suggest getting battery tekkeon . sorry bad review , but i my hopes this device well .	-1

this terrible . i returned after hours tech support days email exchanges apple support desk . product probably better future software updates , but my experience , it fairly unreliable its current state . examples problems : wouldn't download drm managed content online , problems when downloading itunes purchased music ( first time i've problem 4 years ipods itunes ) , couldn't connect my corporate vpn , finally , just evidence lack qa this device , included instruction manuals previous version apple extreme . images previous white , button-shaped device . this genuine disappointment , it seemed stem bad software bad qa . others seem more success , but i'm back my 802.11 airport extreme all problems magically disappeared	-1
i cannot speak all devices , but this total failure my case . i am fast typist , it seemed 20% keystrokes not picked up my treo 270 . this simply unacceptable , so i immediately returned it . i cannot determine whether problem due keyboard , software , or my old pda . newer , faster pdas might better success rate , but potential problems still there . my suggestion buy this somewhere generous return policy so you return it if it mismatch your pda	-1
when i first got this camera , i satisfied . it complicated use ( definitely not intuitive ) because it so much so few buttons you need scroll through endless screens time sto what you want . however , it took pretty good pictures . however , soon after warranty expired , it began overexpose pictures we couldn't stop it doing . we tried contact fuji but gotten no response . my wife found this common problem ( overeposure lack response fuji ) , which probably why they lot refurbished ones sell . hopefully , they fixed problem but i wouldn't bet my money it . this camera given us more frustration than it worth	-1

usually i discount negative reviews . i think people may sour grapes against company , or not understand how install or work something . i somewhat tech savvy - i installed our wireless network took little doing . i work technical recruiter , so technology doesn't intimidate me . i like technology . so i nudging my husband print server so i could print without going printer plugging . he came home this belkin product went installing it . usually i like research before i purchase product , but he wanted handle this . so , he installed it , i went back checked his work , he followed instructions exactly . i know he some trouble , called tech support my suggestion - i would never gotten wireless router hooked up without tech support . only problem , printserver doesn't work . so , i tried installing software my pc , trying problem solve there . i called tech support hotline back , got operator who promised technician call me back short period time . i waited 2 hours , then went out run some errands . there still no message technician when i returned . this morning my husband needed get some work home . he created document , knowing print server not work , he wired up printer print way . but now , printer won't respond signal , so he can't print way either . so we deleted belkin software rebooted computer . he still can't print . so , i went back my pc , tried delete software through control panel . it won't delete . i am getting error message . i can't print either . so now i am hold belkin customer assistance . maybe it coincidence but good english person who refers himself operator , i swear i hear little indian accent . doesn't mean customer support outsourced india , even if it , doesn't mean customer support bad . but my experience this while i get real live person phone , he can't thing help me except promise me someone call back . when i tried get my problem escalated , i overwhelmed him he put me hold . i am still hold . i hold 35 minutes no help sight . i called back my cell phone , someone who sounded so much like first operator i spoke said he would escalate my call level 2 technician , someone would call back 1-2 hours . when i strongly protested , asked his name , asked number i could call directly , he offered transfer me immediately , now , i hold additional 10 minutes my cell phone . i am starting sense trend here . my husband - boiling over his inability print important document , gone off work print it there . i am sitting my sofa phones going stereo , waiting see if anyone cyberspace going pick up my call . i usually discount negative reviews , but this really my experience this product , if you considering purchasing it , i would encourage you think through little further .	-1
i purchased 16 allsop 26625 dvd/vhs organizers . after i 4 or 5 them floor , loaded dvds , i going move them load next batch . but , when i picked them up off floor , two them came apart , dropping dvds floor . knowing they weak , i tried hold next one together , but pressed little too hard opposite corners ; other two corners gave way , my hands came together , scattering dvds all over floor . looking pieces came apart , i saw hooks molded into plastic supposed snap over ridges next piece . but hooks too shallow hold against strain holding them dvds facing upward , they same all 16 boxes . i emailed manufacturer ( whom i bought 12 boxes ) asked , since it would time-consuming me send them back , costly them , what would they offer me if i just kept them glued corners together . i absolutely no response . i ended up spending two evenings snapping boxes apart , glueing 112 attachment points reassembling them . i think they ok , now , but i would not purchased them if i knew they so poorly manufactured . , i not any good thoughts allsop customer service	-1

i've my e-10 around nine months most impressed it performance . my interests radio pretty much revolve around . . ( or medium wave ) dx'ing shortwave listening . it performance a.m. par highly regarded kaito ka-1103 which i received christmas this year . shortwave performance very close , however , kaito superior this area ( features ssb tuning well) f.m. ? e-10 well above average but falls short kaito ka-1103 . i've yet see radio equal kaitos performance this area , but e-10 closer than most . build quality , ergonomics , appearance second none better than most . slightly rubberized texture this set just plain feels good when handling adds overall impression this " top line " portable multi band receiver even though it moderately priced . it lcd digital display one largest nicest i've seen , very easy see well lit pleasant orange backlight . other amenities such 500 plus memories , 12/24 hour clock , i.f. shift antennae trim which both useful shortwave reception , local/dx switch internal battery charger nicad or nimh batteries all add up make this radio i'm glad i purchased often recommend those needing radio this type . even accessories included this radio such carrying satchel , earbuds , reel-up shortwave antennae top notch ! now , if you're wondering why , after all this praise i only gave it four star rating , not five it because eton not provide ssb tuning capability this receiver . it shame because it shortwave performance good enough utilize it . my opinion they shortchanged this otherwise exceptional radio . hence they only " hit triple " (which way more exciting nonetheless , i'm baseball nut too ) not home run	1

mine over half year now , after outstanding abuse it performs well day i bought it . i fill it empty it every month , rarely ever defragging it , back up my pc files play movies right off it my laptop . throw it my backpack , plug unplug it all day(hotswaping ) , still rarely sign slowdown , it barely gets cool warm ever(even when its running inside my backpack ) . some reason requires two usb ports my new pc ( high speed usb 2.0 ports ) when it shouldn't . it runs one port school just fine i switched cable regular usb cable 50% success . i'd buy one these heartbeat if i ever thought one i would run itself out . fact it doesn't need external ac adapter run my usb 1.1 laptop ports(though it hole non-included ac adapter)is blessing . i've even used its double usb cord run my power hog external cd-rom drive(my cd-rom ac doesnt work both sadly ) . might luck draw , hd related items seem sometimes , i've yet try out their customer service . but overall worth every cent spent(especially since i looking 4gb external $40 before i saw this ) . nearly $1 gig great deal .	1

i would give high recommendation this tv . it perfect size bedroom especially if you're not looking overwhelm room but you just want something watch late night movie , morning or evening news , or late shows high def . dvd player works great really completes package it seems not increase size tv all . picture outstanding isn't what really matters end ??!! only little annoying thing concerns what would great feature but big limitation - tv aut o-o feature so you use it like alarm clock but it requires you select channel which tune tv once it goes . it you use hdmi i am get signal your cable box , you must tv input mode set hdmi but you can't set aut o-o hdmi input ( it must channel number ) . engineers just didn't think one through all way . oh well , still great tv	1

this everything i looked mp3 player , but only first 6 months . half year getting it headphone input went , making audio staticy constantly going mono . send it repairs . after 5-6 months light use ( mostly car , so it not like it bumped around bags pockets ) problem reoccurred . send it repairs again . couple months later , after 1 year warranty expired , i noticed battery life started decrease . few weeks it got point lasting only hour after fully charged . i nevertheless continued using unit , extra careful damn headphone jack making sure i charge it every night . so couple weeks ago ( 15 months after purchase ) it stopped working completely . when turned it gives " hdd error " message . resetting not work . computer no longer " sees " it when it plugged . i emailed tech support got they said it looks like hard drive needs replaced possible cost $195 . needless say i won't investing two hundred bucks into clearly faulty unit . i really liked it before problems started eventually planning upgrade 60gb model , but i doubt i'll trust this manufacturer again	-1
i bought this tv march this year ( 2006 ) it worked perfectly until sony techs came out " updated " my firmware . i not any problems tv but thought it should updated or possibly affect warranty . soon tech left i turned tv , fan running " high " loud . this not happen until software updated . i went into functions tried use high alt function turn fan low ( off ) but would work . good news i bought extended warranty get it fixed , or replaced ......... word caution , you may consider not updating firmware if tv working , buy extended warranty . i paid $300 4 years figure i'll get least one $250 bulb out deal ( yes , it covered ) . otherwise , tv perfect	1
i purchased sony dav-fx100w system over internet . it surprisingly arrived only few days . assembly wiring instructions well . it looks good matches well my sony hdtv . sound quality just fine movies tv programs but fair best listening music cd or fm tuner compares inexpensive stereo . base not tight kind whoompy , although there plenty it . i actually decrease it 3 db . many sound stages remarkably different true sense there such " sport " which sound like stadium . most time it best " auto " performing method audio recorded . ir transmitter/receiver works well but there still plenty wires rear speakers such ac power amp , wire ir receive amp , wires amp both rear speakers . not clean one might imagine product description . mentioned previous reviews , 5 disk changer very slow rather tricky insert disk until you get knack . 5 disk change not necessary system would probably used dvd watching movies opposed inserting multiple cd listen music . i certainly would prefer my stereo ! over all i am satisfied it recommend it . it performs well what it intended , reproduce sound movies tv . again it good looking system .	1
while i am pleased quality sound this system gives me , i am little disappointed . i've this thing couple years now , 9 months it stopped giving me sound . so i went back replaced it . they didn't even ask what problem , they gave no arguement because they so many returns replacements . then over past few months dvd player making pretty loud noise whenever i use it , i turn volume up pretty high just not hear it . now player stopped working completely . i dvd there i can't get out ( which record part sopranos season , they dont sell discs seperatly their seasons expensive which pretty annoying replace ) . bose failed me once , shame them . they failed me twice , shame me . i'm gonna go something else	-1
2.0 gb sandisk cruzer micro flash drive looked like good deal when i saw it display office depot . it roomy enough all my data configuration files , rated usb 2.0 , reasonably priced . my first choice would larger version 1.0 gb iomega i use work , but , alas , such wasn't available . unfortunately , i waited too long put sandisk through its paces , or i would tried get refund . many others remarked , it horribly slow . while backing up my roughly 10,000 files , i found it taking second per file -- longer big ones . this translated around four hours complete whole operation . bulk deletes take just long carry out . using my beyond compare file synchronization software * read * sandisk compare its contents what my hard drive went reasonably fast -- until , no obvious reason , it hung one particular word document this evening . i couldn't even get my windows xp machine shut down without yanking sandisk its slot : usual " safely remove hardware " operation wouldn't work . after three attempts read same file , three reboots , i tried delete it windows explorer -- this operation hung too . finally i able deletion dos prompt . just like 1985 ! i then recopied file , now beyond compare finish its work without hitch . but i trust sandisk deliver up my precious files when i really need them ? i dunno .... so , it back drawing board . maybe now iomega come out 2.0 gb model . sandisk , i'm reminded painful adage : you get what you pay . ugh	-1

i trying find way easily carry lot camera equipment quite some time . i tried backpacks , shoulder bags , duffel bags , but none them really worked all well . then i saw lowepro street field system completely customizable pouches , vests , belts , accessories . it works great , you only get pouches you need so there no waisted space you organize them however you want according how often they used ( put frequently used items easier access places . ) variety alone this system worth investment , but quality ease use also very high which big plus . you get case any lens , camera body , or accessory you . i even cases my cell phone water bottle . one word caution , sure measure your lens lens hood backwards if you use them make sure entire thing fit into pouch , because sometimes lens fit , but then lens lens hood not . i often carry 5-6 lenses , extension tubes , teleconverters , extra memory cards batteries , bunch cleaning supplies other gadgets , which weights ton . but when they evenly distributed this vest/belt lowepro system it actually very manageable . only down side everyone staring you because you thousands dollars camera equipment strapped your body . but if you overlook , this way go . i used this system many zoos without ever problems , fact just unzipping single lens switching seems safer me than opening entire bag equipment every time you want switch lenses . many cases also come built rain/snow cover so if weather changes all your equipment not destroyed . you also put just few pouches normal belt when you just going take photos back yard or don't need take all your equipment , which nice . i really can't say enough how much easier this makes traveling lot equipment , if you hopelessly searching better solution , consider this , you won't regret it .	1

first all , these good speakers , nice design but it one flaw . batteries ... . it eats them up ... fastb . if you use batteries instead wall plug it comes , it wont go loud , if it thinks your playing it loud , it start .. skipping .. or something sort . but , it good sound quality , honeslty when your go , when you really need it blasting ? also they just .. barley large enough you cant put them large jean pockets sadly , but it doesnt weigh much all . i really like how if i ever say .. lost my ipod somehow , it cd player ( walkman ) hook-up so they wont become useless if i lose ipod . ( wall hook up also comes many different adapters )	1

i bought these use my samsung z5 mp3 player . while packaged earbuds good , sound just drowning bass . i like good bass , but not when it completely overpowers everything else . i given sony 51 try promptly returned them ; they sounded ok , but kind made my ears hurt , $40 , they weren't worth it . i read some reviews these 828 , so i decided go these . sound incredible . bass well defined , but balanced nicely midrange treble . i literally hearing nuances music i didn't other buds . they fit very well ( though any earbuds start feel uncomfortable after period extended use , which discouraged anyway ) . set black foam earbud pads included . i always prefer use pads , but it course your own call whether or not you use them . pads wear out , but you buy exact replacements radio shack ( pack 4 $4 ) fit perfectly . personally , i usually end up replacing pads every few months or so . my only gripe 828 ( only reason 4 instead 5 stars ) cord too short my taste . foot or so would nice . otherwise , this great product around $10 steal	1

i've looking way fix dvds our toddler " enjoys " . obviously he shouldn't handle them , but he loves " helping " so how i resist . unfortunately he scratched up his favorite dvd point it won't play most sections . so this device arrives i run repair , buffer then repair , repair clean . my disappointment disc wasn't playable ... until , i tried using more than few ( small ) drops repair paste . using three big drops his dvd playable once again . i'm repairing cleaning dvds library too . if we still netflix this would indispensable . instructions clear device works quickly . its pretty noisy though	1
i received this unit via my home insurance after my rca 5-disc changer stolen . unit itself solidly built , i don't any issues playback performance or picture quality . i think if you get this unit , you'll pretty happy it . what stinks documentation , remote , setup . manual your typical poorly-translated engrish guide most people come expect inexpensive electronics . fortunately , if you've any experience setting up dvd player , there not much different here . unless you want progressive scan . here what you if you want use progressive scan mode : 1 . connect both component cables s-video ( or composite ) cable your tv . hopefully it both inputs ( most hdtvs ) . 2 . put your tv s-video ( or composite ) input . 3 . enter setup menu ( not confused options menu ! ) choose progressive output . 4 . now you unhook s-video ( or composite ) cable put your tv component input mode . thankfully this one-time hassle , but it still assinine panasonic couldn't either designed autodetect or used physical switch like my old rca . rca , i just hooked up component cables , flipped switch , set up dvd player 16:9 aspect ratio i . lastly , dreaded h07 error . i think i figured out what probably causing majority them : when you eject tray , currently playing cd/dvd still motor continues play . neat feature swapping other discs without interrupting your music , but upshot ejected tray empty slot it . you guess what happens if you accidently put cd/dvd into seemingly empty slot mistake ? avoid this , instead using eject function , use swap function . this stop playback make sure all discs out drive avoid damage . overall , great player price . just careful it bear tricky setup	1
i use it outside my deck watching dvds summer . it sturdy , easy move around , quality excellent . i would highly recommend it	1
while sports kit very reliable fun use , i found it still more mp3 player than training tool . better more casual mid-week run than speed work or keeping track details long training run . this not say it not great running tool . website great offers lot motivation . , you don't need wearing nike shoes use this . there many options ebay sports stores attach pode your current running shoe .... but i still like my garmin forerunner better ..	1

i read some other reviews stating this home theater system makes buzzing noise . however , i my doubts so i ordered it anyway it great . no buzzing noise mine all . i apartment didn't really want spend whole lot coin major system i couldn't really use anyway because noise restrictions . this system nice clear gives me home theater experience i looking . they give you plenty wire run edge room still enough slack hang rear speakers up behind couch wall . granted speaker wire isn't all thick , proprietary male/female connector into unit which would make upgrading monster cable pain . it still sounds great under $200 bucks why would you care anyway .	1
i bought 5 these computers house . i would got better ones but house auto generator so all i need 30 seconds power . i noticed review person saying there unit going battery mode even when power still ... my understanding this unit detects ( dirty power ) when it detects it , it then stop accepting ac power . i think software it comes allows you turn feature off or even turn sensitivity up	1

i started searching wireless surround speakers due configuration my apartment . wired solution simply would not work due location my couch distance my tv . after searching while , there only couple options available : sony dav-fx100w , system panasonic optional wireless option , wireless receiver kit made kenwood . after looking reviews all different options , sony dav-fx100w appeared like best choice . i'm very happy decision . dvds look great my hdtv 1080i upscaling feature . forewarned , if you wish use this feature you need purchase very expensive hdmi cable your tv need support it . i bought 3ft belkin cable ( instead monster ) it still over $100 . dvds also sound terrific ; surround impressive wireless solution . like any stereo , it important adjust levels each speaker , i pumped up surround speakers little well center channel . subwoofer , others stated , pretty powerful passive speaker . there could more depth sound , however , it out box solution i think it sounds good enough long standard output kept it default sound level . others complained cds don't sound good ; i disagree . i've played several cds i think they sound great . i also input my ipod through video1 audio inputs , sounds pretty great too . again , like any receive , you'll need play settings audio fields enhance sound your liking . overall , i'm very happy this system	1

i think this very good receiver . number people complained issues wireless fm modulator static causes . i would say there some static times , but most time i not this issue . however , i clarify statement , noting if you traveling long distances , you most likely switch fm frequency few times during trip ( my case it two hour trip sacramento bay area ) station you set likely not free entire time . however , it very easy switch frequency , so i able adjust it without any difficulties . receiver itself , i like compactness it it not take long figure out how go through various menus , save stations , etc . i not care much suction cup part car kit . although it worked fine my car window , i really didn't want it there , so i actually just use cradle place it one my cupholders , but this personal preference . i would definitely recommend this receiver my friends .	1
prossmallcuteself-powered - comes power adaptor . i 6 devices hooked up it , including 2 usb hard drives , it works fine without adapter - big plus me . most hubs would not work this setup . usb 2.0 1.1 - 6 devices hooked up , 3 low speed 3 high speed , all work very well . runs cool . consnot sure why , but they put 7 ports one side hub power/uplink ports other . this dumb . if you hub desk it looks awkward . all ports should back leds front . here , leds next each port which makes them completely useless you don't see them . hub very light so when you lots devices hooked up font gets elevated . overall , best hub i've ever i tried many	1
this hub worked exactly anticipated . i've it month or so now it hooked up my laptop . i've got wireless mouse , epson printer , ipod , fuji digital camera all plugged into it . it performs amazingly when syncing my ipod . i even it unplugged power source it performed without issue . i hesitant purchase due some reviews but it perfect my needs !	1
beware kingston rebates ! course , i hope your experience would differ , if you buy kingston product(s ) , but mine terrible . i bought kingston compactflash card offered $50 mail-in rebate . i promptly ( , day after i received item delivery ) went photocopy my rebate certificate upc code sales receipt ; then sent it all its merry way . yes , i well within rebate period , both purchase postmark date . my purchase valid retailer ( think huge online e-tailer ) . rebate required sending entire original upc label , which like entire outside package my cf card , size 1 business cards when flattened . no problem . two months later , i get letter saying " your rebate request denied because you failed furnish appropriate original upc code required rebate offer . " well , now what ? i can't re-send original ( it already their possession ) . i called , they insisted repeating what letter said . i re-sent my photocopies they said photocopy invalid proof purchase . after 6 weeks pursuing this , i figured this their scam . they simply wouldn't honor rebate . without original upc my possession , i couldn't really submit their requirements . if you're looking ram upgrade , i'd suggest you look quality company like ocz ( best ! ) , or patriot , geil , or corsair . if you're looking value flash memory card , i might suggest sandisk . one , kingston not make best products , they value-driven products . two , there competitors kingston just good or better value-to-performance ratios same prices . three , kingston not stand behind their customer i experienced . i urge you , please , cautious kingston their rebate scams	-1
less than dollar per sparkly frisbee , this best price i find frisbees . they don't fly very well they break relatively easily , but this best value i find 100 frisbees one place . lot people disappointed because they expect able use these discs writable cd media . problem , they don't work very well either . i , too , tested this myself . using nero burning rom , i tried many times burn different kinds data onto several discs - = 4x = - , just like you're supposed . it worked ! it burned fine . then it took 5 minutes open simple html document burned disc . subsequent trials run " verify written data " checkbox checked revealed every other sector or so unreadable after burning . it like writing white crayon , except this white paper . this persisted several other computers different cd burner drives even different software . i finally realized what great frisbees these things . cheer up people : they great fun ! so grab your spindle , go outside , start chucking these things your neighbor annoying dog . ps . i need sue memorex selling this junk . these disc just form abuse	-1

buttkicker adds bit shake your home theatre . it doesn't replace subwoofer , but sort-of turns floor into lower subwoofer . i love it . but there some things you should know . first , lfe kit ( amp ) probably best choice start because you can't drive it your receiver - not enough power . so getting game cost you around $500 . which more than aura bass shakers , but far better . second , one lfe kit sofa nicely , but if you , like me , mount it under your floor , you're gonna need two . possibly more , but probably two . because that lot more mass shake , otherwise they'll maxxing out making loud knocking noise . third , it not like riding rollercoaster . you'll feel floor shake loud sound effects , bombs , etc ., but don't expect magic . it makes movie more real , but it doesn't toss you around . all said , it great addition . if you afford cost-of-entry , you'll amazed how shallow system feels it off	1

i am filled feelings anger despair i see once great palm corporation its death throes . i bought my first handspring visor deluxe early 2001 $250 -- it stolen 11 months later -- bought refurbished one handspring feb 2002 just $100 . device gave me outstanding service until it died just few days after its 4th ( re)birthday . refurbished device lasting 4 years ! since yesterday i looking replacement , inexpensive palmos handheld . unfortunatlely , there only palmone ( or whatever they called now ) corporation left ( swallowed handspring ) palmos sold japanese company . reviews palm current products -- nearly all longtime loyal palm-product users -- nearly uniformly slam products . i am depressed . i hate ms pocketpc ( or whatever they call current version ) devices -- they much too complex , they slow , they too windows-like , they darned expensive . contrast , palmos devices snappy , reliable , simple easy use , relatively inexpensive . what more could one ask ? there seems no reasonable alternative now . should i take risk low end palm z22 ( it fail two months ) . handspring customer service used outstanding . palm current customer service sucks big time . even if company goes out business next six months ( it definitely gone before december 2006 ) , i don't care , long i get decent palmos device lasts next 4 years . thanks all good times , handspring palm ! too bad you faded away left us devoured microsoft	1

i took time line read what other reviewers wrote this particular radio some other brands . i chose this over product even though they seemed same . this radios only one complaint , blue light . other radio , people complained setting up clock times . blue light not problem b/c we placed this our bathroom where it could listened while getting ready work , etc . we difficult time reception our house due signal towers foothill near us some products , like cell phones , some television cable companies , they not always work well here . so i concerned may issue this radio . it not only works great but i agree other reviewers sound wonderful . it holds up our other more expensive radio . i would definately recommend this product others who looking great sound	1

i owned forerunner 305 3 weeks . mine performed exactly advertised . gps rapidly acquires satellites i not problem it losing connection . i live hawaii gps no problem finding satellites ( updating almanac data ) providing fix while i sat my living room initial start . since then it occasionally seems take longer find satellites , but while i input my planned workout it continues find satellites time i am , it ready track my progress . heart rate monitor worked perfectly . it not once failed immediately display my hr . so far it worked better than my polar dedicated hr monitors . display feature allows you customize different displays up four attributes each out list over twenty different parameters . example , if you want know how long you left , how far you gone , your current heart rate , sunset while you exercising you make display just ! display illuminates well night . i found pace information very useful not all jerky . since gps not provide speed directly , 305 like any other receiver calculates speed based measured position changes over time . since those calculations tend provide pace information naturally jerky , 305 allows you smooth data varying degrees . it records raw speed information , but pace it displays " high " smoothing very steady useful . i not tried other pace settings because i am getting useful information . bottom line , pace information useful , but may require you adjust settings your personal preference . best part 305 how it effortlessly provides useful summaries your workouts , tracks lap lap performance , allows you transfer information computer . i update software watch ( firmware ) , usb connection , computer program so i may avoided problems plagued earlier versions . i very impressed how fast easy moving training plans routes watch historical workout watch computer . entire process took no more than 3 minutes didn't require any complex setup . once your training records computer , they displayed garmin software or number different third party web based software solutions provide different analysis tools , workout plans , trails explore . most features available online free . even if you don't use computer , watch stores long history previous workouts displays your previous workouts useful summaries . summary , 305 great tool runners who want monitor their workouts or keep accurate record their training very little effort !	1

this very well made cooling fan your laptop . however , if you 15.4 " screen your laptop hang off it inch both sides , 17 " inch half both sides . problem ? no , not really . you want air circulation underneath cool . 3 fans great . most cooling boards only 2 . earlier reviewer said he didnt like it because back " open " . well reduces weight increases air circulation . it well designed my opinion . on/off switch nice . it only work course if laptop running . you never forget turn it off . it runs amazingly quiet . you cant hear it but you feel it . it really meant keep battery cool help heatsink fan . cooler working battery last longer . it good angle work . i really havent found anything wrong it . i highly recommend this item , however , if i make suggestion improve it , it would add couple usb ports it .	1

sound quality good but i really don't like style ... it smaller than you'd expect it , because image shown not actual size mp3 player . reaction time when you press buttons display screen ehh bit slow i'd say ... i just always happen pass song . i'd much rather buy ipod but heard it not most reliable thing ever . but i know fact ipods very quick , unlike this mp3 player . i'm shopping new mp3 player around $50 but found no luck getting sleek styled reliable one . i guess i'll just wait prices ipods lower . i not trust pre-owned ipods or any electronic pre-owned items , you never know how previous owner treated item before selling it online . also , this mp3 player only two colors really , silver white . earphones gave too much loud surround sound which i really disliked , so i used earphones my previous sandisk mp3 player . okay ... so maybe this mp3 player doesn't really many problems , but these just my preferences i just don't like overall appearance it . many my friends ipods they work well ... no problems yet , so i guess they're pretty reliable . also , battery mp3 goes quickly ... if you going long trip , i suggest you extra one or two batteries you . i constantly check see how much battery life left my mp3 display screen . i really not recommend buying this mp3 player if you teen like me , because you regret it . i found style this mp3 extremely unappealing while after i bought it ... time went i started dislike it more more . soon prices ipods lower , i'm definitely buying one . i ... like many teens look mostly sleek style ipods offer course reliablility ... after all , it very fustrating time after time buy new mp3 player because how unreliable it	-1

this great solution people who want always-on file server shared multiple computers . i think performance average this kind device , but if you only want access disk single computer , you'd better esata or usb drive which much better performance . performance especialy slow when you first access files , but i think might due power savings features ( server rated consume only . 6 amps ) . configuration extremely easy or without supplied configuratin utility through really simple web interface . documentation minimal , but you don't really need it long you know default admin account admin no password ( which i lookup online ) . one note , if i make this purchase again , i'd probably get 250 gb instead 500 gb drive i didn't realise how long it takes copy backup 500 gb data onto relatively slow server	1

i really like this printer ! very glad i dumped my hp favor this . most other reviewers covered everything , but i wanted mention ink refilling . this printer uses opaque cartridges , so you actually see ink level inside . this important because this printer set up recognize when you refill cartridges : if you refill cartridges , you disable ink level detector , machine records fact you bypassing their outrageous ink prices ( this applies non-oem cartridge replacements well ) . once cartridge used , chip not reset ( you epson chips proper resetter ) . therefore , ink level never known again , other than pulling cartridge out every now then checking it visually . pre-filled non-cannon cartridges : they don't come ink level chips . you remove one your spent cannon cartridge attach it non-oem cartridge . this doesn't allow printer tell you level ink non-oem cartridge -- it merely allows catridge used . i managed deal these annoyances , i lot high-volume printing , i am very careful refilling cartridges so they don't leak out into printer ( i.e. , i two sets cartridges , i leave newly-refilled one out machine least day make sure it isn't leaking once refilled , i use rubber plugs come most refill kits instead flimsy " tape dots " supposed seal refill hole -- they don't work ! ) . all said , this great little printer . it no fax , i haven't tried scanning function , but strictly printer , it suits my needs perfectly . i run printouts online business , so this thing gotten major workout already 6 months or so i've owned it -- much more than many you may ever print , print quality very good . it , however , require 5 different ink tanks , each which replaced/refilled separately ( no more wasted ink ! bonus , course this always good us ink refillers ! ) : 1 . ) black2 . ) black pigment3 . ) magenta4 . ) cyan5 . ) yello	1

i'll admit , i lost my original stylus while moving my home , so i buy replacement . pro : this new stylus works just well , added bonus built ink-pen - that fantastic . con : only negative ( it only slight negative ) , telescoping top doesn't work quite well original . don't get me wrong , it telescope feels great when ' long position ' . but while ' holder ' , sometimes it doesn't pop-out first push . it more slight annoyance than problem	1

i strong preference trackball over mouse ever since trackballs first became available because , unlike mouse , trackball requires very little space no physical movement other than rotation ball . i owned several mechanical trackballs various manufacturers over years but all eventually became difficult use because build up dirt their internal mechanisms . but this kensington optical trackball which operates very smoothly -- , optical , rather than mechanical -- should continue so . it smoothest operating most convenient trackball i've ever owned . i not any sticking problems commented previous reviewer ; mine operates flawlessly . if you've never used trackball before , please consider trying this one . you may quickly become trackball fan	1
pros : gigabeat considerably cheaper more capacity than ipod . it compatible plays sure vongo ( movie download service ) . nice screen , although suited more watching short recordings than full length movies . pretty easy transfer almost any video mpg or wmv player ( although mpg require conversion wmv through mediaplayer ) . cons : battery life not very good , i average maybe 7 hours . interface player much sloppier than ipod ( play/pause , forward track , back track side player pretty easy accidentally bump ) . mediaplayer very buggy program , when you set it up auto-sync there often duplicate albums other weird problems . i recommend using something else transfer your music videos ( even just drag drop ) . player slow response times when advancing tracks sometimes ( couple seconds or more ) . overall : though i listed lot cons , i really like player . it very nice not tied down itunes only major source legal downloadable music , battery life issue isn't all important me - it made it pittsburgh paris playing almost entire flight .	1
i talk landline or treo 650 all day my home office . i've using palm treo headset treo calls , my treo wired headset landline calls 5.8 ghz panasonic cordless phone , surrounded 2.4 ghz wireless internet signals . while this setup works , issues ( ) i am tethered desk ( often tangled dropping cordless handset ) , ( ) switching headsets hassle ( i not try wearing both headsets separate ears -- too confusing i want one ear available local environment ) , ( ) landline callers often complain they hear " echo " their voice treo wired headset , ( ) extra step plug my palm headset into its charger ( its lack low battery indicator ) results recharge it when i need using it . my ideal solution would enable me answer calls either phone single headset , keeping my hands free working my computer , un-tether/untangle me so i move around my office home , provide convenient recharging stand headset ( like jabra jx10 ) . my functional priorities : ( 1 ) 2-way voice clarity , ( 2 ) wearing comfort stability stay my ear , ( 3 ) range . cool style/design not significant factor . i stumbled plantronics 510 headset , which seemingly unique " multi-point " technology enabling it pair two phones same time . on-line research revealed seemingly well-designed desk phone adapter integrated headset holder/charger . value optional " handset lifter " hard assess without seeing it working . but entire system expensive ($399 list plantronics site , $300 other retailers ) , it requires wired desk phone--it not compatible cordless , due way it connects wired handset . however , i know plantronics manufacturer serious office headset solutions , so i figure you get what you pay . i read some reviews ( few available , not even listed treonauts site ) , found it web $210 , ordered it test it out . well , i've only using it 3 days , but it superb ! i dusted off old wired desk phone ( keeping cordless programmed numbers place calls ) , plugged everything together , paired my treo easily , kept all default hear/talk volume settings , charged headset - started placing/answering calls -- flawlessly ! talk quality , even my critical , hard-of-hearing friend no complaints . listen quality , i raised hear volume switch base one notch , now it perfect . handset lifter awesome ! i dial call cordless , then press call button headset ; handset lifts you hear call going through ; i hang up cordless . range-wise , i walk upstairs kitchen refill my coffee , step outside greet fedex man , * almost * get mail - which 70 feet base station ! conservatively it looks like i get good solid 30 feet , through walls , no quality loss ( though still only 10 feet if i'm talking treo ) . nice feature : if i * * go out range , low tone indicates this -- without dropping call -- high tone let me know i am back range resumes call ! receive call either treo landline , i just touch call button headset , which conveniently centered my ear . once you set listen volume good level , this only button you really need touch , it easy " find " . comfort-wise : very comfortable ! over-the-ear design keeps headset feeling solidly place ; smallest earpiece fits snugly my ear , but absent pressure other earpieces i've used ( gels ' hard ' earbuds ) . i hardly feel its weight my ear , there * no * pressure inside my ear ; i easily wear it all day . when i take it off , i stick it right into its holder/charge - so it always charged up ! packaging could use one very small improvement : headset eartip guide could use some verbal description , complement diagrams , selecting/fitting right eartips , removing them headset you try 3 different sizes . i am careful , discerning technology consumer , am aware real proof satisfaction comes after weeks use -- not hours or even days . i save all packaging return product not perform expectations . i tell you i am already confident 510sl keeper ! i post updates this initial review couple weeks	1

i recieved this dvd player christmas gift . i know it cheap dvd player got it gift , so can't really complain . but i'll point out some stuff just case you're considering this one . screen : screen resolution isn't great can't really see much change adjustments , but dvd watchable it . compatabilityit plays dvd-r i've burned most factory bootlegs i've tried . some bootlegs audio off . don't know if it player or disk since some bootleg disks don't even play my panasonic or samsung dvd players , but disk works fine computer dvd drive . haven't tried any original disks since i don't any here . it also plays mp3 pictures . resolution pictures don't show up clear screen . battery:haven't really chance watch full movie it , but battery seems last long . i only charged 3000mah battery once since i got it . battery charged while use . cables : i like it comes ac adapter car adapter . i don't know why it doesn't come video audio out cable . it ports video audio out , but no video . :( i hoping able connect my ipod video it bigger screen when watching videos . bottom line . if you're looking cheap dvd player don't want spend money more expensive one , this one not so terrible . it light enough , screen size good enough . if you laptop dvd drive , you'll probably enjoy watching dvd more since it bigger better screen . i give it 4 stars out 5 , it cheap price it what it supposed even if it not exceptionally well	1

if you're like me , you probably wondering if these little cables actually worth money . i using cheap thin wired connections before , my receiver would lots background noise buzzing , so i thought i'd go ahead give these things shot . afterall , i listen mp3 all time my computer through my high end receiver . i'll tell you what , these things work great , worth extra money . now keep mind , i'm audiophile who very picky sounds . so casual listener who doesn't mind occasional background hissing or lack crystal clear sound transfer your computer your receiver , you might able find cheaper connection . but once again , i think extra $$ well worth it i highly recomend these . your only concern here economical one . far product concerned , these things top notch	1

dinovo cordless media bluetooth desktop , logitech produced product sleek appearance . product looks sharp mouse nice hand-feel . mouse rechargeable battery comes recharging cradle , so disappointment finding dead battery your cordless mouse relegated " old days . " when product works , there noticeable lag keyboard entry or mouse movement response screen . surprisingly , lag time seems greater this bluetooth device than my older non-bluetooth cordless desktop , but it not so long make product unusable . however , this product two fatal flaws . first , other reviewers found , my experience dinovo it crashes constantly . secondly , logitech no help whatsoever this product . keyboard mouse work less than 50% time simply not acceptable my needs . bottom line this product didn't even help my clutter problem my desk , because my corded keyboard corded mouse sit right next computer , rapid access whenever this product decides stop working . this product troublesome , unreliable decidedly not recommended	-1

great little gps unit -- good bang buck , especially linux user . i surfed checked out number usb gps receivers , most not specifically mention linux supported . not only , but many support multiple data formats apparently require driver software change data modes . according holux web site , this unit worked linux they even offered drivers . i late model low-end dell laptop running simply mepis i use car , it got hassle use my old hand-held gps because i change batteries , stick mount windshield use serial usb adapter , not mention changing data format nmea mapping software i . ordered received this unit , plugged it into usb port , power light came , after minute or two started blinking indicate it good position lock . fired up my gps software laptop , position indicator right my house . took laptop out van , stuck gps receiver out sunroof , ran computer 36 hours straight while mapping various trips -- receiver worked flawlessly . if you run fairly recent linux kernel this unit should work just fine you also . well worth price	1
this pretty good cb basic rig it price class . if all you looking no-frills cb car keep touch others or get road information while traveling , pro 510xl nice rig . i cigarette lighter plug my pro 510 so i easily put it car whenever i go trip . audio speaker pretty clean , i found range cb pretty good it size . it helps good antenna , such wilson 1000 or something similar . one thing i don't like radio microphone pretty cheap . uniden chose use electret microphone element mic pro 510 pro 520 radios . mic element draws 3 volts power radio itself power mic element . this makes it virtually impossible use any other mic other than one comes radio . i told you use some sort amplified mic , like one astatic series hand mics pro 510 if you want go better quality mic radio . if you try use regular dynamic mic like most cb use , transmit audio just won't sound very good . mic uniden supplies radio adequate , i wouldn't say it excellent . all-in-all , i think pro 510xl good basic cb . uniden backs rig 2-year warranty . give this radio look if all you looking simple cb traveling keeping touch others road .	1

like everyone else i researched portable dvd players quite extensively before buying . i settled this model because 1-panasonic reputation , 2-9 " screen , 3-long battery life , 4- fm transmitter , 5-accessories includedwe just made round trip 6 hour drive picture quality very good , these things aren't imax , i am very particular audiovideo quality i would say you won't disappointed screen . audio thru headphones car fm very good . fm signal runs into interference you drive thru different markets but you just find signal readjust settings , very easy . base unit speakers adequate loud enough but don't expect high quality surround sound experience . controls easy use very simple . i originally going get lx-9 docking cradle , external speakers lots add ons . then i realized i probably wouldn't use any extra features price too high . imo , save your money , this excellent portable dvd player everything you would need . it quite portable , fits easily front seat arm rest console , very stable , long battery , includes car adaptor , ear phones , carrying case available rebate . i would recommend it	1

i've owned this tv six months haven't moment trouble . i'm receiving hdtv off-the-air only ( no cable ) outside antenna , i receive cincinnati stations 40-50 miles away . i two wishes tv , though : 1 . it needs able download entire program guide , not just display information what shown now ( it wouldn't hurt set clock same way ) . 2 . tv needs automatically limit volume . commercials often much louder than programs . i'm wearing my remote control out . if signal gets marginal , tv displays " digital signal scrambled " even when it isn't . unlike samsung i owned , this tv doesn't blank out picture but freezes it momentarily if signal glitches . even wind trees this . if you cable or satellite , won't problem . overall set excellent : great color , powerful sound , wide viewing angle . black case fits into decor far better than some silver models . price , it good buy	1

( i fun used christmas patterned fabric left over project sell my christmas related items ) . cons : i didn't buy this sooner ! it paid itself many times over higher auction closing prices sell-throughs because better photos .	1

my setup older hitachi ultravision 61 " hdtv , ( 2 ) bw 604 front , bw cc6 center ( 2 ) bw 601 rear speakers . i ready spend much more money replace my dead sony receiver but since my hdtv not hdmi inputs i didn't see poin t.t his receiver perfect my application . i only component video inputs my cable box dvd player . audio , my cable box uses single coaxial input . my dvd player uses toslink connector my pc uses one other two toslink inputs . this leaves me ability add one more component video toslink audio device . note : 5.1 setup connect rear speakers center channel surround set rear channel speakers " none " configuration . if you don't connect rear speakers this way you simply won't get surround sound . receiver plenty power intuitive setup use . remote easy setup but you press several buttons switch sources because there no macro function ( like higher end receivers ) . that not problem me because i use sony rm-av 3000 remote control which macro functions . don't mislead low price -- this receiver packs lot features money . if you don't need switch or upconvert hdmi , then this right product most mid-end applications . far xm hookup goes ; i'll never use it . i sirius i use streaming internet audio my pc through 50 ' toslink cable listen over receiver . my pc , i creative x-fi sound card optional digital i/o module . only thing missing receiver toslink output	1

xmas my wife myself treated ourselves olevia 32 " lcd tv bedroom . one problem i needed 3 remotes . one tv , one tivo one cable box ( demand ) . both cable box tivo basic tv functions refused work tv . expensive logitech remote i also refused work tv . morning spent googling confirmed there issues this tv remotes . solution presented itself " open-box " sony remote $15 . quite simply put learning mode it learned anything !!! i tv component programmed control all functions i use all three remotes . only time i need change component if i want watch cable demand ( which not often ) . excellent product price , fact i'm going buy one replace logitech harmony main room	1
nicely constructed well padded . looks classy , too . bad news ... no strap or belt loop just silly sideways loop . no protected hole earphone or controller . whole thing just trifle small minidisc . minidisc fits , sure , but no space left earphones or discs ! i suspect same would true many mp3 players well . so it makes nice padded carry-case quot ; cpuquot ; my minidisc system ... but it isn't carrier go jogging	1
we're upgrading our 15 yo toshiba tube tv . sdtv comes out so-so all lcds , pixelating somewhat annoying , but hdtv comes out superbly . we're getting in-the-clear qam analog channels cable , but i find tuner little slow , picture sound lags we compare it our old analog tv set . this might just digital tuners general . initial programming channels took long time , 5 minutes tuner scan all channels cable . we get 10 digital channels , rest ( ~ 30 ) analog . other reviewer noted , this tv actually fits standard cabinet , so we jumped this tv over some other models much wider bezels . 37 " size also perfect small living room , so you far enough back so you don't see all pixelation apparent up close . set simple matte cabinet , which what we prefer over glossy which i find distracting . menu system easy use feature loaded : you customize cc settings ( font , color , etc . ) each channel , picture size settings seemed remembers across all analog channels ( we usually leave it 4:3 ( natural setting )) , picture freeze setting very useful phone numbers , weather forecasts sports . incorrectly noted review there no built-in dvd player . but dvds nevertheless play very nicely , i'm using component video cheapo cyberhome dvd player , so speaks well built-in video scaling tv . composite video sucks , so don't bother unless you really want use your vcr ! not tried hdmi or vga , so i cannot speak those . sound good but not great . i not use srs wow because it distorts sound my disliking . srs focus good dialogue , but again , i prefer unadulterated sound . i use trubass low , but high it bit distracting . stablesound very useful feature , those annoyingly loud commercials . larger room , i would definitely use surround sound setup . i wish some things made easier though . there no direct way turn cc , you go into menu system turn it ( each channel ) , or mute tv . i find this cumbersome if i just want use cc occasionally . i would also liked direct button change picture settings , like if i'm switching movie sports , again you go thru menus this . power save feature nice , but it takes 5 seconds tv power , which takes some getting used . i also find channel browser feature bit useless , even though i am tuning directly cable , not using set top box . you cannot label channels , so i find annoying , channels all jumbled don't correspond actual channel number , so labelling would make it easier navigate channels channel browser . overall , i bought this tv because its superb picture quality , which something you cannot get cheaper set . features good , sound ok , but those not factor much picture quality	1

i've this two years . using winamp , ati multimedia center ( tv tuner software ) , other media players windows xp . software cumbersome set up each program you use , but ability customize any program uses keyboard execute commands , it worth it . also used it powerpoint presentations . if you want transfer your settings pc , you copy install folder " : \program files\keyspan " your new computer , then reinstall software . keymapper uses 4mb memory . remote battery lasts me year daily use , $2 replace	1
i given zune gift , recently . this isn't first mp3 player i've owned but it one largest capacity store data i've owned . up front i'll tell you i'm not hardcore ipod junkie , nor am i apple kiss-butt . i believe products work . said i see why people prefer ipod over zune , though i say zune isn't deserving some bashing i've read these boards people who believe it cool bash microsoft products just because they made microsoft . good1 . zune large , bright lcd screen easily seen sunlight . video picture quality good . 2 . sound quality good . factory earphones adequate delivering music though i pair philips earphones far superior only cost $20.3 . box includes data cable you need syncing . 4 . interface super easy use it easy get around zune environment i've not any music skipping problems 1.3 firmware automatically downloaded when i synced my pc . 5 . unit itself feels solid when held , slightly heavy though not too heavy . 6 . software loaded without problem my winxp sp2 system i no problem syncing machine when connected usb port rear pc . i all my non-itunes songs added player within minutes . 7 . zune allows you beam songs , pictures movies other zune players range . first generation player , it gets job nicely i look forward seeing what generation 2 bring . not so good1 . when i connected zune 4 port usb hub pc didn't recognize it there . i connect it back pc usb 2.0 port order get it work . maybe that design , though i'm not sure . once i this i no syncing problems all . 2 . i've never found zune range share anything . leaving wireless seems drain battery faster . i'd recommend turning this feature off until more people buy zune ( if happens ) . 3 . you can't buy music or movies wirelessly . 4 . although zune wireless it not compatible your home or business wireless lan . 5 . you can't browse internet zune . 6 . zune software no problem getting your music onto device , though zune marketplace vastly understocked compared itunes music store . 7 . zune cannot get music purchased through itunes ( this nitpicky , i know , but would so nice ) . there way work around this - you burn your itunes songs disc then turn around rip disc pc mp3s then import them zune , which i would rather than pay money re-purchase music i've already bought once . 8 . there no way re-organize files your zune once they uploaded device . say example i want throw couple pictures into picture folder so when i view my pics i don't scroll down forever day see them . i delete pic zune through pc software , add pic folder i want then sync pc player . folder added zune library order update occur . 9 . there no way change orientation photos or movies when viewed . i would like able flip them counterclockwise or clockwise 90 degrees view them portrait view instead turning player its side view landscape mode . one reason why this important when i set one my pics my zune background , i'd like able see just how much pic cut off since zune doesn't resize pic fit . oh yeah , that thing ... 10 . pics used zune background don't option re-sized fit screen . what i would like see change zune ( more microsoft than anyone else)1 . options re-sizing pics fit zune screen2 . options changing orientation pics movies3 . ability organize my files zune without delete file re-sync . i'd like able this player software both . 4 . since i use usb port back my pc longer sync cable would nice . 5 . put built-in wireless good use . slap compact internet explorer allow viewing web pages email ! you don't need keyboard view read-only content like weather , news sports it would really add player value6 . allow zune able buy music , pics video without connect pc . again , make use wireless capability zune . 7 . something zune marketplace - it just needs overhaul . it needs additional music , movies definite bump cool factor . 8 . make it easier customize outside zune . you this additional customizeable faceplates xbox 360 - same this player . if you hadn't noticed - individuality here stay	1

my original review below . it still stands if you may some these hanging around 2004 or before . shortly after i wrote this , though , maxell went pot . i throwing away more cd than i burning . it became so frustrating i switched fuji . these days , i would say fuji all purpose best ; hardly ever any malfunctions , no data loss yet . they also seem work fine any cd recorder . so , while maxell used great ( i used them cassettes all time back day ) , they decided some point cut corners rather than make product customers like use reliably . this point , change five stars one . ________________________________________________________________________for me these best cd market . i basically used this brand because they ones i generally used when transferring my albums cassette . same quality continues . i personally never liked using fuji or sony recording media past . tdk wasn't bad cassettes ; however , my record cd-r them 25 wasted discs out spindle 50 . i so far used hundreds maxells ( this line their others ) only one or two discs i discard due errors . also , all ones i made few years ago still sound grea t.t hese best cd-r both price performance	1
apple , once again , delivers yet fantastic product . after doing my research find 3rd party wirless unit , i found i no choice but buy airport extreme card my imac g5 . i'm using linksys router it works perfectly . i made mistake installing card first then plugging antenna . if you install this sure plug antenna first making sure plug all way tip collar ( which takes little force ) then insert card securly it seat . if you don't get very strong signal look card antenna again it more than likely isn't all way . it very easy install so if you comfortable opening up your computer it yourself . once you it installed that all , go your airport icon make sure it ... that it ! you're up running ! easy plug go !	1

i bought this card after i got logitech z-2300 speaker system . it made huge difference overall listening experience . highly recommend it , especially if you're currently using your on-board sound chip decent 2.1 speakers . you get optimal performance if you connect analog audio output your pc cd drive directly card rather than going through motherboard .	1

this my first mp3 player so i don't anything compare it but i love it . sound unbelievable , picture gorgeous touchpad exactly what i wanted . it sensitive but i use touch mouse keyboard very light fingers so it like it made me . that medium setting , sensitivity adjusted . there couple things i'd suggest would make it better but they're minor points . one , instruction manual pathetic . only thing worse user guide creative website . it actually showed menu options this model weren't actual device . but googling zen vision brought up lot discussion forums where all my questions already answered . other thing i don't like how it doesn't separate album artists contributing artists , making artist list three or four times long it needs . lot names i don't even recognize because they're collections windows media player grouped under various artist . i would preferred method sorting but when weighed against incredible sound ease use , it very small matter . i bought custom skin protect screen case it couldn't better . it easy put while you press buttons through it , it easy locations clearly marked . while i haven't dropped it yet ( fingers crossed ) , rubber feels thick enough provide some protection when i . altogether , it realy pleasure use i totally recommend it .	1

this telephone attractive programmable features those so inclined , performs well , provided it located fairly close electric outlet . if used home dsl internet connection , you'll probably install filter phone telephone jack . relocating segment back plastic body enables phone wall mounted . this not too easily because long telephone line must packed into interior bracket . dsl filter make phone hang farther out wall well . panasonic tells me they not sell longer handset cord replace short cord which they supply , so if phone mounted wall you may buy off-color aftermarket cord . wall mounted phone i should downrate it bit because these factors	1

i read quite few reviews this other universal remotes i decided this one based price , looks logitech reputation ... i absolutely love this remote ! it easy setup ( once you get package open ;-) it fairly well built , but not any children i am not overly concerned rough handling , besides i would much more worried thousands dollars components getting damaged children than $70 remote you ain't buying one these some crappy old crt beta max ! if i any concerns/issues this remote it would ( others pointed out ) numerical keypad bottom remote , not disaster , just mild inconvenience also usb port cover not seem " seat " perfectly . there quite few reviews i read kill this remote due issues updates incompatibility devices activities not behaving right way , etc ... now maybe things changed last 4 or 5 months , but i zero problem software downloads/installations . logitech pretty specific order which setup their devices . moment i got remote connected cd installed it immediately connected website downloaded latest greatest software version . once you type your components information ( manufacturer , model number , etc ... ) software hits website downloads codes needed work remote . setup activities simple ; you " rename them " , change their order modify them any way you choose . one mistake i made this may something reviewer well when i " modified my activities " i never hit " update remote " button . i promise you , unless you some bizarre components some bizarre configurations or setups this remote answer your prayers getting rid bowl " remote control salad " you probably sitting your ottoman or coffee table !!	1

i got ( 2 ) these stands couple yamaha cp-33 pianos ; basically , free add-ons . i couple professional welded dual-x stands already , so i believe i'm position make fair comparison . assembly not really problem . it took me 30-40 minutes or so put both them together ; i work slow . i agree others included written instructions little bit confusing/not much help , but if you lay parts out ahead time , mentally think process through/study instruction pictures , you'll probably just fine . they logically go together , but my advice : take your time . think process through . i should also tell you second stand definitely went together faster easier then first . once together , i used ( 1 ) support yamaha cp-33 ( 40 pounds ; 88-keys ) stand-up church performance situation . no real complaints ; although overall , it not stable either my other dual-x . little bit rocking , true ; but nothing unmanageable . my guess home use , sitting down ( it center gravity lowered , it " feet " further apart ) , it should work well ; although you might hit stand legs your knees ! try sitting front one assembled before you buy it , if all possible . well , that it ! not much stand , really . but i would say money , you'll probably not able much better . that why i'll give it * 5 * . it fine ...	1

those whom this may concern , this case also fits ipod 30gb photo . case isn't tight people describe it but it fits perfectly . this case doesn't make ipod much thicker . it barely adds any weight fac t.t he plastic it made great . it definately scratch resistant ; it so strong you could use pocket knife scratch back your ipod won't even harmed . when you put case into jean pockets , it tends stick there so taking it out inside-out your pockets ( i hope made sense ) . this case not slid off dashboard either ( although i wouldn't recommend it ) . although packaging says it shock absorbant , i don't recommend dropping your ipod . screen protector wheel protector , i recommend you cut out piece paper protecter slip into case . hard plastic cases come also work but after you cut it out , you'll use sandpaper sand it smooth so it doesn't scratch you ipod once you put it . after you plastic case , you're ipod completely protected . only thing i don't like top too wide open dust tends get top . bottom case perfect ; it closes completely so case also acts dock protector . i ipod 20 gb also , this fits well . 40gb ipods , i wouldn't recommend it . my friends who 40gb ipod tell me it doesn't not fit . some able jam ipod into case but cannot good i t.t aking ipod ( 20/30gb ) out case very easy smooth . it not scratch ipod all when you put it or take it out . those people who sync thousands songs time , you should take your ipod out case because harddrive gets hot skin only making it hotter ... hot = bad . overall , this case wonderful . i wouldn't recommend anything this price perfect compared other cases . honestly speaking , i think these cases took less than 25 cent make factory i believe price outrageous . like i said however , compared other cases ' prices , this actually pretty good . pros : + long lasting material+ cheaper than other cases+ scratch resistant+ doesn't scratch ipod when removing/putting on+ you dock/charge/sync ipod without removing casecons : - you make your own screen/wheel protection- case top little too large allows dust enter- doesn't holes back let ipod " breathe " 5/5 ****	1

i both palm tungsten zire 72 . i've owned both over 2 years honestly haven't problem aside losing data . this happens when battery dies completely ( i'm terrible recharging electronics ) . however , i must say voice recorder digital camera zire 72 lifesavers certain situations ! i able take clear voice records lectures within large classrooms . time i purchased zire 72 , it came free expansion card ( mail-in offer ) . when card didn't arrive , girl their customer service number very helpful friendly . i definitely continue buy palm products future	1

if , like me growing percentage computing populace , you use your laptop your main computing environment , i recommend you add pilotmouse laser wireless mini your workspace . you don't realize how much annoyance standard touchpad until you plug this mouse appreciate its wonderfully supple touch feel , epsecially when combined really nice , compact high-end mouse pad like 3m precise gel wrist rest ( mw307 ) . i like pros cons approach used previous reviewer this page . here mine : pros ---- * eye-opening smooth scroll * laser technology amazingly accurate . specs say " 30x accuracy improvement over optical . " believe it . * ergonomics mini really well thought out ( e.g. , little rubbery fins side ; profile height same your standard laptop ) . * nice " travel " configuration - usb antenna slides bottom mouse also turns it off process . kudos industrial designer little nuance . cons ---- * everyone note here , usb antenna pretty big ungainly . * i wanted deactivate my touchpad ( i'm cursed " phantom touch " phenomenon ) , but two occassions now when i've plugged usb device top pilotmouse antenna , mouse frozen up forcing me go touchpad resolution . * somehow , one point , my middle mouse got inadvertantly set relatively useless function horizontal scrolling . i tried use software ( which must downloaded ) set back vertical scrolling - i got it , but not without lot headscratching . not intuitive all i'll say there	1

this powermac g5 , or so label says . i haven't tried this older g4 computers so i don't know if this really needs driver that built g5 or something . i got this heck checking what it me . nothing really . 1 . first you know this adapter connects dvi port , not old adc port . what this means aluminum displays g5 model use dvi . this case , then you problem right there fight over port . unless you high-end optional nvidia gt card dual-dvi port , then stock ati 9600/9800 cards come one dvi one adc . so i would think people g5 or thinking upgrading aluminum display then you needing adc dvi converter hold monitor tv same time . makes using two " monitors " respective adaptors . why ?! unless apple envisioned phasing out adc port soon , it makes no sense . if they envision phase out adc then why release cards g5 still adc port if new monitors use dvi this adapter also uses dvi . they trying make money selling adapters ? 2 . i haven't seen perfect computer tv interface major video card manufacturers same way matrox perfected it . what matrox dual monitors one using tv it automatically routes video signal tv . if it detects your playing movie file , it just brings it out tv full screen . no need drag your windows into screen then making it into full screen . this adapter software interface doesn't it . it just makes your tv into monitor extremely low resolution , naturally . point adding tv monitor obviously put make multimedia viewing experience more enjoyable hassle-free . if you play quicktime file or dvd movie your computer , you would want it played your tv . nope , not here . you drag it then make it full screen . but it doesn't stop there . try opening application full screen tv monitors automatically switches back into one within window . very stupid annoying . so i believe they should follow footsteps matrox create custom software allow just . put check box if you want your video automatically output tv , window , first monitor , second monitor , etc . 3 . above suggestion actually works final cut pro application . but if you're video editor , you really wont even need this . you see once you connect your tv via this adapter then you route your tv your monitor which good check actual picture quality tv screen . it cheap solution . however , if you editing final cut pro then it would natural you either video editing card output tv/monitor while keeping your dual computer monitor active editing . or , you camcorder firewire output or some other similar solution you use route computer camcorder tv . using firewire actually better solution this adapter because it not allocate video card memory tv via adapter . using adapter connect tv you eating up video memory computer monitor tv . so if you 128mb memory then 64mb goes each . this slows down video information evident if you using big computer screens . using firewire video card not interfere allocates full memory your computer monitor . 4 . os isn't even perfect interfacing adapter . you connect adapter you'll need constantly restart computer whenever you connect/disconnect it . simply putting computer sleep waking it won't work . your video card still thinks tv connected despite no tv nor adapter ( after waking sleep ) . shut down computer , remove adapter then start make sure all video card memory allocated back your computer monitor . so unless you high end video card afford split memory interface automatically routes video signal your tv , this pretty useless . it just fun prove you output part your screen your tv hassle all . skip until they improve software	-1
weighing here , i think i add little bit more discussion this product : pros : * supports unicode character song titles folder names ( this means if your song title written chinese , it'll display chinese player screen ; because i unicode library this very important me )* supports multiple file types , meaning you not locked into converting all your songs proprietary format ( my library huge mixture file types iaudio plays them all -- so awesome )* x5l small -- much smaller than i'd thought * my whole cd collection fit onto 30gb storage room spare -- reason i liked this unit * bright , big lcd screen * it not ipod not made apple * volume easily adjusted without looking device * music libraries dragged dropped into player they ready play ( very important feature somebody who already their music library organized way they want it player)negs : * joystick navigation not intuitive . once you navigate up or down your song choice , you're going hit " right " joystick , right ? no , you press " down . " now you're ready go back so you're going hit " left " right ? no , you press " down . " baffling stupid * no " stop " button -- want stop music ? you can't . you turn off unit * order charge or connect unit your computer , add-on component required * ear-buds don't stay your ears cord different length each ear * protective case or belt holder not included unitin general i'm actually very happy this unit . like other reviewers , i waiting just right type mp3 player come out before i bought something . this comes pretty close . i carry my entire cd collection my hand which what i shooting , unit supports unicode titles folders . likewise , i able drag drop already-organized music library into unit it worked perfectly . so , this product good merit . what would make this unit superior product : carry-case belt clip included unit or available somewhere market . ( i yet find good one . ) power/usb connectors should right unit rather than special attachment . also navigation system should intuitive ; i don't mind joystick if system works , but its current programming clunky awkward . i feel very bitter sweet this purchase . it what its supposed , all right features . i'm glad i own it . but cowon would well listen these issues correct them next time around	1
i've using this sony recording church services couple years now . obviously , this not high-tech operation . i convert tape into digital format editing my pc create cd . i've able make some great tapes so far i'm recording huge " cathedral " type church . size cost , i think it great . i don't think i'd use it listening music microphone rather " noisey " . i recommend this persons who aren't ready make major investment high-tech recording equipment	1
this my second foretrex , i love it . price , it gives all data i need . it very accurate , holds ample way points , stores tracks , navigate , interface capable optional power cord . it terrible map . if you want map , color screen , driving directions , exc ... this not gps you , but if you want super small , accurate , cost effective gps , this it !!!!	1

this fine pocket radio people who need something small don't want suffer interference using ac adapter . mini300 takes 2 double-a batteries . fm/am reception above average sensitivity . however , radio newbies go crazy drift , radio inability lock into desired station . you're better off spending 10 more dollars getting sangean dt 180 , which runs only one small battery , digital , doesn't drift . if you want something standing alone your office or bedroom , i suggest you buy best radio currently available , kaito ka2100	1
this walkman sony offers serious music lovers opportunity listen mp3 files stored cd , regular cd ( course ); am fm radio seven tv stations . it even sports weather digital tuner ! remote comes handy if you don't want carry actual player your hands you walk town . moreover , it only uses single aa battery time you get lots play time out single battery . even better still , this portable cd player weighs only one pound -- this very lightweight machine poses no hindrance if you use it you walk through streets . great ! first glance controls walkman itself appear intimidating but after ten minutes tops you learn all important most commonly used functions . controls also make it easy adjust levels bass change equalizer settings . other functions , including listening tv station , require more concentration time learn . however , instruction manual fairly clear if you questions you always contact sony customer support phone or interne t.t he product description this page indicates software making " atrac " cds comes packaged this player . however , when i bought this just last week there no such bundled software . instead , product manual indicates i need download relevant software sony website . however , there remains no extra charge download relevant software make " atrac " cd . advantage making " atrac " cd you fit much , much more music onto " atrac " cd than you ever could otherwise when making your own cds . indeed , owner manual this walkman states you fit 30 cds ' worth sound onto one " atrac " cd . excellent ! however , i noticed some disappointments . first , sony advertises this walkman music enthusiast -- they right . this means average layperson like me spend couple hours learning how use all functions this walkman . capabilities this little machine impress me greatly ; but there learning curve persons like myself . i not anticipate . addition , buttons rather small so you need careful how you touch them your fingers . finally , earbuds hurt my ears almost very start listening cd this walkman . i strongly suggest you purchase better quality headset or earphones more comfortable . overall , music enthusiasts thrilled this walkman . abundant features amaze me i believe you impressed , too . quality sound excellent ; you even make sound constant certain level which product manual indicates you won't hurt your hearing you listen music or talk this cd . shockproof memory " skip-free protection " impress me , too . i highly recommend this portable cd player music lovers everywhere . addition , if you time learn how use this machine its greatest potential , any layperson like me also come cherish this walkman .	1
pros : lot features such video playback , mp3 , organizer , alarm clock , voice recorder , fm tuner . using their software basically like opening up explorer windows . resolution sound quality nice . buttons instead touch pad allows more precise control . removable battery pack nice . there additional extended battery pack available purchase . speaker so you blast ghetto music fancy restaurant if you'd like . take compactflash card transfer data . many other fun features . cons : omg it huge !!! i honestly wasn't expecting it big . i thought " hm ... maybe little bit bigger than zen vision ...? " this thing almost exact same size my nintendo ds ! i just can't get over how huge it . it bit turn off those who might want use it exercise walk around . think super old school walkman but significantly heavier ! when delivery guy dropped it off , i shocked box so huge !! i thought they sent me wrong item ! then i opened it ...!!! i almost repulsed how prehistoric it looked ! more cons ... thing lags . it definitely doesn't operate nearly fast ipod when switching menus . i guess that because all things it offers . it get little bit tedious frustrating . even more cons ... lack accessories . i guess i probably won't need toughskin or protector this thing , because if i drop it , it'll damage whatever it lands , purely its size . overall , far functions this player concerned , i'm happy it . however , i'm still trying get over ridiculous size thing . i dare bring it out public ? what would my friends say ? would people stare ?! i highly suspect they laugh . oh well ... i guess i really only going use it play music car . i must remember hide it glove box before i let any passengers car	1
main reason i purchased this product because it supported 1920x1200 dvi interface . product works advertised . switching computers very simple they timing keystroke capture down really well . item compact fits nicely my server closet . my one only complaint usb keyboard port not pass-through usb port . i microsoft keyboard fingerprint reader when connected kvm none my computers recognize fingerprint reader ( only keyboard ) . only when i connect keyboard directly computers fingerprint reader recognized . this very unfortunate since i really enjoy functionality fingerprint reader . i trouble-ticket open avocent , but i am not hopeful . update : i got response back my trouble ticket : " currently avocent kvm switches not support fingerprint reader keyboards . due configurations additional hardware avocent not looking into support secure fingerprint reader access keyboards . use this type keyboard currently not supported device .

i so excited get nav/dvd our new suv . however , i hate this unit ! you can't watch dvds unless car park . whole point me watch movies passenger seat while my husband drove . also , you put navigation cd everytime you want look new address . this means you remove your dvd or music cd put this special disc . you then park put your dvd back start it again ( we screens headrests ) . worst part you can't use any features nav system while you driving ! i pull over enter address or find point interest . while my husband drove , i figured i'd able use these functions . it not user friendly . we read manual still cannot accomplish tasks such programming radio stations ! i regret this purchase immensely . i not recommend this system anyone unless you willing put car park ever time you want use any its functions	-1
we bought this tv after reading glowing reviews only find out picture quality poor when viewed slight angles . also , after 13 months use ours now died . sound works but picture gone . cycling power on/off might bring back partial picture few minutes but then it gone again . expensive lesson	-1
we this tv since november 2005 really enjoyed it . we it delivered via amazon delivery option . delivery guys unboxed it outside house placed it floor because we hadn't yet found appropriate tv stand . my father law husband then spent day getting everything programmed . picture quality clear i've grown dependent tv guide which comes tv . we've no problems tv . we definitely liked ease competitive pricing amazon offered . i know some people difficulty shipping . we've found delivery people give you call if you request it , so you don't need wait around all day . person problem delivery people not hooking tv up him , i've never encountered delivery people who would . i ecstatic when guys who later delivered my tv stand actually took time place my tv top new stand .	1

it actually looking dozens flat-panel sets prompted me choose this one , i am entirely satisfied my choice . first dvd i watched lawrence arabia , it truly like sitting theater . few hd channels we actually get ( through comcast howard county , md ) , show promise all hd eventually bring . said , there caveat regard cablecard feature , which i wanted activate , , disappointing results , though it seems largely comcast problem , who claimed , after four tries , they couldn't guarantee compatibility . ( they powerful disincentive provide this service , btw ) . so i go cable box all its attendant wiring ; since this tv mounted over fireplace , it involved fair amount extra holes walls . since i bought this , price even come down bit more , which expected , but overall , this set provided best " bang ( lcd ) buck .	1
this product awesome ! it takes few minutes figure out how program s.a.m.e. but should not prevent anybody purchasing this terrific product	1
okay , idrops works -- just mere polish , it marvelous -- makes your device look shiny spotless . it remove scratches , but you gotta use some elbow grease , lots lots cotton balls , patient -- repeating over over , then over over again , then , over again . after , you'll probably it over then over again , before it over , then over again ... but you see results -- scratches greatly reduced , if you stick it , you remove them comletely ( but again , it'll take while your arm sore next day ) ... patience muscles keys here ! but diligent effort , it make your device look brand shiny new . your biceps delts look more toned too ! one thing -- i bought this my new macbook . most my scratches underneath , back edge , where printed insignias apple information ; thinking idrops safe mild , not realizing printing actually top , i quickly removed one insignias where it says , " designed apple " -- poof , polished it almost all off -- careful around printed areas	1
i bought this play divx movies , needless say , i wasn't expecting whole lot ; this extremely inexpensive piece hardware . all-in-all , i've pleasantly surprised , it perfect solution playing divx movies through my home theater . it even gone beyond call duty regarding storage media , even though manual states divx files need read cd-r or cd+r , i've using dvd-r discs without any issues all ( this lets me store 5-6 divx movies one dvd disc instead 1 movie cd disc ) . i haven't tried using dvd+r yet - i'll update this if i remember so . hope this helps .

this one best ways add major security hole your network . mvp allows full filesystem list read access entire computer running media server . there no way disable this " feature " . also , remote interferes my phillips television ( most manufacturers test their ir scheme interactions prevent this sort thing ) . although it looks like it should , mvp not any hardware display . it also not show song names internet radio streams requires streams bounce through your computer . my experience tech support not good either	-1

sony hmd1g hi_md minidisc now little bit more availableand really good idea . it major improvment original minidiscs which only held 60 mins ., 74mins ., 80mins . new one holds just under eight ( 8 ) hours music or datawhen recorded standard play mode . quite accomplishmentfor sony . i agree other reviewer who opines thatsony not seem making decent effort " sell " theirproduct . it almost if they want this format go way " beta " or " dat " one would think sony would want recoup r+d money invested this format . i personally thinkthat $6.98 disc holds much this one great buy	1

i tried out my new pet320 fairly satisfied quality finish product . i played one each , dvd , vcd , audio cd mp3 cd , my surprise dvd audio cd gave out relatively lower volume output max volume than vcd mp3 cd . but fair say volume levels enough enjoy movie distance 2-3 feet , which would your normal viewing distance this 3.5 " screen . audio seemed sound more crisp while using rock equalizer settings rather than default . one thing i not test though volume levels when you some disturbance around , i think it might need lot desired area . picture quality good player very rugged compact look , it would fairly safe say disc mechanism would reliable owing philips brand name . you get what you paying more , since lot stuff bundled together package including car kit , pouch , av cable earphones among other things . it would great if philips threw small remote price , but maybe future models . retractable stand could annoying beginning , but once you get hang how much force you need apply it just works fine what it made . i connected this my tv picture quality perfect , only thing volume won't increase much beyond certain point even if i crank up tv volume . ideal places where you cannot carry your tv you , still need dvd entertainment	1

overall it good product except two things : 1 . usb way too short , little bit over 1 foot . lacie , what you talking ? it probably costs you only one dollar add some extra length . whole point external hard drive its portability short cable doesn't give you . 2 . usb interface , dc power , power switch put all one side , but led indicator other side . again , dear designers , you ever tried work your own stupid design ? you know how awkward ?	1
this usb-hd what it supposed . i no problems so far . it extremely silent . external ac adaptor bigger than others i've seen . although its design porsche , it nothing more than steel box feature surely must not influence your buying decision . it comes formatted fat32 maximum portability among operating systems , but if you use winxp you probably want reformat it ntfs create some partitions over its 465mb formatted capacity . process takes well over hour	1

i got this tv few days ago so far i am very pleased . picture hd very good , rivals some my friend sony lcds . setting up pc monitor shaky , but once you get settings right , it very cool(except sitting close long period time quite uncomforable ) . i am little displeased dvd quality , my other hdtv looked much better same player component cables . i heard tv not automatically upscale component images only those hdmi input , which would explain this . i plan buying hdmi capable dvd player see if this fixes issue . either way picture large improvement over my old crt . i would give this item 5 stars except tedious setup order get everthing working picture refined . i would deffinately recommend this item especially because its built hd tuner .	1

note : though this definitely card i ordered , one arrived wasn't labeled ' transcend ' but ' topram ' . not sure if makes difference or not . i bought this card go my new treo 680 . ( note , other review incorrect , although capacity not read correctly ( it maxes out 4gb ) , card still work fine newer palm treo products , patched work others -- websearch more ) . i like me some media , already filled 2gb card music , movie , tv shows , really wanted something bigger . this card fit bill perfectly . i've got 5gb it already , it plays all music video files very well via ptunes tcmp . only downside card * very * slow write , incredibly slow delete . card reader which came it approaches bearable , but trying delete within treo itself so slow i avoid it whenever possible . still , 8gb this price incredible . update : i reformatted card via command-line use 32k block size , this seems improved speed large-sized files ( music , videos , etc .	1

i want wireless headset skype maybe some gaming . i thought zx-6000 it , but it not . not even close ! first , sound get really bottom out . sometimes my skype friends sound like gurgly lagoon monsters , hungry ready feed . i can't hear mid or high ranges their voices . connection seems unstable , causing pops drop-outs . so i take it back , lagoon monsters may more coherent . initially i thought this skype problem but i plugged my wired headset i could hear them clearly . i like headset design , but it doesn't feel comfortable my ear . i imagine if my grandma took out her dentures sucked my ear i could get same sensation . it ok few minutes , but after , i can't take it anymore .... wearing headset , . volume levels fine volume buttons work , power button . call button , other hand , anomoly . it nothing unless you use voice windows live messenger . even then , you install software . button doesn't work skype or yahoo . but what annoys me most button would serve much better microphone mute button . this headset not mic mute ! volume mic mute controls essetial any headset ! how could you not mic mute ! so those my big gripes . few other things annoy me : 1 ) usb receiver large considering dongles come mice other peripherals pretty small nowadays . it also cord , which good if you want set receiver your desk , but i prefer just small usb dongle plugs directly into my pc . i bought wireless headset ... forego wires , not take one off headset add it receiver . 2 ) it would nice if headset bluetooth so i could use it my cellphone . it stands , it just works pcs . i know , i'm probably asking too much seeing how microsoft overlooked some more basic elements like mic mute ! i want use wireless headset , but there not much like this one . i regret purchasing this headset . i just hope my $[ ... ] rebate comes through soften blow	-1

i purchased this joystick 10 15 hours it time this review . overall it good stick . i thought it drifting first but noticed it actually my hand " resting " wrong . i took my hand off it it stoped drift . i've only calibrate stick once so far . i like stiffness stick , it uniform throughout movement ( ie not increasing/decreasing you near end it range ) . grip little small me , i don't overly large hands ( sorry ladies ) so this might consideration if you big hands . front button above trigger button presses little awkwardly first , but once you get used it it not too bad . three buttons base front stick spaced so you 1 finger each them without difficulty . i would like see pinky button this stick , but didn't expect one since it wasn't picture . all all it good stick , but i can't speak life-span , just out-of-the-box performance	1

we often prefer brand name product such sony , toshiba , or sandisk pay much money strong belief we got great stuff . however , due competition business companies global market , most brand name products now assembled china or taiwan , so quality brand name products , fact , not good we think anymore . if we carefully read some tiny words around upc barcode kingston sd memory card , we see kingston products assembled japan , so quality kingston memory card good quality brand name products like sony or toshiba but we buy kingston memory affordable price . spend my money wisely , i prefer kingston product ; great stuff great price .	1

title says it all . i put them my x51v year or so ago it still pristine . they're slick ( no stylus drag ) completely transparent . they require slightly more pressure i suspect they muddy positioning little bit but it hasn't problem me . far biggest downside getting them installed . backside slightly tacky though stickiness doesn't come off . it attract any lint or dust around once it gets backside it doesn't come off . no washing or wiping could budge it . display must absolutely perfectly clean you need clean environment ( i amazed amount lint floated onto display while i fitted first one . ) you also cannot touch backside or you'll leave fingerprint mock you until you replace shield . i use tweezers small screwdrivers other bits position shield . all they're pricey but they're still best units i've tried	1

it features it claims , software works ok ( my mac ) . it doesn't claim fast , it isn't . 300 dpi ( which probably all most people need ) , its speed definitely acceptable , but not blazing . higher resolutions , scans take quite while . price , i'm perfectly happy wait ( or something else while long scan completes ) . if you're graphic designer scans all day long , you should probably spend more faster scanner	1

so you want home theater . your wife says yes if you hide hideous stack black boxes . sounds simple . this remote makes it very simple . i shopped competition options monster massive home theater controllers . since my budget not $500-$1500 , i avoid big controllers . it monster universal . most my components " code list " worked perfectly just code . my tivo/directv exception . tivo code only made tivo work sat code only made part work . i used learning capability remote even though i program every button , it fast painless . rf features remote work perfectly also . i my components cedar closet 20 feet my projector couch . it goes through walls fine . powerblaster transmits ir signal closet not even facing components works due high ir signal it outputs . macros turning everything on/changing input projector also easy program work very well . $100 i paid this , it steal . there no way monster counterpart gives enough additional functionality warrant high price	1
when i bought this product year plus ago , there wasn't many reviews out there , even here amazon . now i remembered , i checked see there many reviews . it seems many issues this product dying which isn't good . however , those us product hasn't died , this product god send . i tv across room cable box . i 2.4 ghz wireless transmitter received while but once i moved , i major interferences microwave , phone wifi . i researched it found this product which claim no interference these devices . took risk bought this product . i am happy report it works great . limitations it : - it line sight it work well- when you walk front it , sometimes , it make sound crack , which pretty loud 11pm your wife sleeping- no use other applications such transmitter your audio system " traditional " speakers . still best product its application . strongly recommned it anyone , keeping mind what it can't .	1
i like this product . it low profile great value . i connected radio cd player it . radio should kick out automatically once cd player starts . my only minor complaint radio doesn't kick out until sound output cd high enough . i once played cd very quiet passage beginning , it didn't switch over until it got louder . if you just looking great amp you technically declined spouse or significant other can't comprehend , this amp you . auto power feature great . sound very clean faithful . i wish it subwoofer out . would make it perfect me	1
excellent product price . efficient , not too heavy carry around . slight hum voice track dependance remote . these minor points notwithstanding , excellent buy , would recommend it	1
this product works great , good sound , easily hidden . only draw back back speakers still connected together wires . i expected them independent not wired together , probably should read fine print if there any . good product hovever low price !!	1
i like simplicity beauty it ( it so different other mp3 players out there ) . i figured out how add my own ' genres ' how make it recognize my files folders ( retag your files , i simply use wmp it ) . i just need know whether there way make it pick up where it left : turn it off , then , then say minute 2:34 seconds last song played ( that 6minutes 14 seconds long example ) . thing : where you get it new less than $50 ?	1
this well designed product fits ipod mini perfectly , allows it stand upright so it doesn't get banged around etc . while syncing or charging . i bought two - one attached my stereo system used standalone charger ( playing music through stereo ) , second sits next my palm cradle attaches my usb 2.0 hub syncing my ipod . no gripes whatsoever , it very good looking product . i initially bought third party cheaper product , opening ipod too big ( though it works ) , it clearlu designed used larger ipods - it annoying led can't turned off . not very nice room where people sleep . it also looks cheap . apple ipod mini dock looks very classy , not eyesore slightest . reviewer who said:---here joke , dock absolutely nothing more than stand your mini . it comes no cabling it not come ac adapter ( $40 ! ) apple makes sure you can't get any idea what you buying until after you purchased it broken open packaging . --- my ipod mini came ac adapter firewire cable attaches adapter . they plug right into dock , nothing else needed make dock standalone charger . if you want use firewire connect your mac/pc - then you need buy second firewire cable . me ? i just use usb2 cable came my mini syncing	1

i looking bag just laptop power source -- something i could bring school my backpack full books . this case seemed answer- 2.5 inches . when i got it , i knew there no way it 2.5 inches ... it more like 5.5 inches ( i got out ruler , i know . 2.5 inches refers main chamer holds laptop . when you add outer pockets , it bulks up . however , it still very nice , sleek looking bag i am planning keeping it . i would recommend it anyone who basically needs laptop holder one chunky 15.4 inch dells out there ... it really nice , comfortable case .	1
i concerned keeping my new toy safe elements . this product fits performs perfectly . i am impressed fact it thin you really cant see it your mac book . i also like fact i put stickers other stuff my new laptop . reason i bought this product because i wanted some more structure my screen . i laptops before one screen break opening it up . i thought this product would give lcd more stiffness so far nothing broke . this product worth investment	1

i am returning this radio , even though sound very good -- except one difficult station -- reception also very good . i bought this use bedside clock radio . it no real controls except those found poorly laid-out remote ( bose some reason also just uses remote only ) . if you lose remote , or even if you can't find it morning , you can't operate functions . changing clock time , changing alarms or putting radio into sleep mode all take endless button pushing remote . it got very frustrating after while , but because i liked hd sound i planned keep i t.t hat before i found out radio alarm would sometimes just not go off . then machine sometimes jammed up when setting functions refused respond remote or off switch until unit " reset " . resetting unit means unplugging it , unplugging it means you lose everything but your presets ( you go through all cycles set clock alarms ) . final final straw caused me return it find new radio when it started losing signal local station ( but not sister hd stations transmitting same frequency ) . so , sum , i liked look , i liked sound , i liked hd stations , i hated required remote , i hated difficult cumbersome user interface , i hated buggy operation	-1
i bought this a/v switch switch my computer tv source set powered speakers . rca switch produced tons noise other channels , even while turned off . while using tv source , switch added constant " clicking noise " . also this not sold amazon but some " shoptronics " company . they terrible customer service make you pay shipping costs even if device sucks can't even what its specified . beware , not order this switch or shoptronics	-1

purchased surround bar 3 weeks ago . very nice sounds .. i'm happy it - one reservation . advertising leads one believe surround bar utilized wall , or stand . choice i made put it stand i purchased stand purpose . surround bar 4 " height , accompanying cradle it sits when stand-mounted , it 5 inches height . this problem - panasonic plasma i own , it stand , only 3 " above shelf which it sits - thus surrond bar blocks view lower two inches tv screen . weight , height , high center gravity plasma set , it not feasible think it sit high enough stand ( 6 inches over shelf ) accomodate this surroundbar . i explained it all my wife , she cheerily said , " we watch tv standing up see over speaker bar " . i laugh . all my plans clean , installation up smoke . oh well , live learn .. temporarily , i mounted it 2nd shelf . it looks quite good there , but there some impediment each end bar , stand-supports partially blocking left right speaker . stand i bought fits surroundbar perfectly top shelf 43 " , but shelf below only measures 40 " . i am presently contemplating mounting it wall above tv stand accompanying mounting rack but odds my goal home theater - no visible wiring . oh well ... it probably my own fault not knowing how high my plasma mounted it would partially blocked ... but pictures exist surround bar mounted stand , show no such problem . sound excellent . surround sound fabulous . yes , you need buy subwoofer full effect . i use exceptional mirage omni s8 . if not problem my planning surroundbar height , i'd given it 5 stars .	1

this psu looks great performs great . i am using it power asus a8r32-mvp motherboard , amd athlon fx-60 cpu , ati x1900xt-x graphics card , four sata ii hard drives , couple dvd drives , high-end audio card germany , other miscellaneous components . so far , it this without even hiccup . i fairly tall case , so it easy tuck extra power cables away . some folks may prefer psu modular cables , which i computer , but i usually end up using most cables anyway . connection main power cable , however , require glance manual ( least it me ) because all my motherboards use 24-pin connector , whereas ocz split their outlet power connector into 20-pin cable 4-pin cable . it not intuitively obvious me how these two parts connected	1

i got great deal this refurbished multifunction laser printer am mostly very happy it after few weeks light use . it features i wanted ( except duplexing which price jump up ) , but i honestly can't say i've put it real test yet . one critical performance issues me quietness standby mode brief lag time powering up print . i'm very satisfied both counts . scan quality my only real complaint . print quality speed good brother postscript emulation seems excellent job printing adobe indesign illustrator . copying faxing functions perform expected , although document feeder tried eat few slightly curled/crumpled originals . my only disappointment color scanning capability/quality . my brief admittedly less-than-thorough testing , color scans practically unusable-too high contrast blown out highlights no detail shadows . my test scan extremely noisy , mottled gradations , excessively saturated colors . i don't know whether scanner inherently poor quality or just hobbled very limited software offers far too few controls . i'm going look third-party software before completely writing off scanner . despite scanning flaws , price right i'm still happy i bought printer	1

this tv great . i it out box playing xbox 360 full 1080p no time . i love rotating stand it works great my place . i wanted leave review because these reviews helped me so much . i went best buy looked new model samsung next 40 " version this model . newer one slightly better picture , but me it not worth extra 800-1000 dollars . reason why because when i got this baby home fired it up i wanted nothing . i set picture settings my likings , which easy , i off races . only thing i would say could better , i don't even know if this really issue tv , but when i hooked up older gaming systems like nintendo nintendo 64 brightness adjusted see some games . this probably more because those consoles weren't made such tv , but they still worked fine once i made adjustments . i read all complaints sound i completely disagree . i love sound . matter fact i turn down often . way , you gamers , i some research found out xbox 360 fact play games full 1080p component or vga cables hooked up . microsoft released update last november added 1080p output , ( go ahead just google it or go microsoft website look resolution or cables section ) after you hook tv up console display settings 1080p option . therefore this tv great either ps3 or xbox 360 , games sure look gorgeous it . one other thing could've better tv remote . it very comfortable hand , but it reception pretty weak . i probably get all one remote someday . dvd look great it . sound output my reciever great . all functions what they should . buy this tv its steal . enjoy	1

type noticeably faster than type when taking pictures raw mode my fuji s6500 . it takes 7.9 seconds type but only 5.2 seconds type . makes type 1/3 faster write mode than type . i haven't tried timing it read mode ( downloading pictures camera computer ) , but i expect similar time advantage type . one thing may concern someone using it take movies little warning back shrink wrapped case says this chip may cause interruptions when recording movies 640 480 pixel mode . i don't recall seeing same warning my 1 gb type chip . other hand , i used 2gb type chip take uninterrupted movie no problem using up full 2 gigabytes one movie . but i not able download 2gb movie file my computer my camera . even when computer plenty free storage , downloading 2gb file repeatedly crashes computer . i not state certainty what culprit , whether it camera , type chip , or fuji finepix software . also instruction chip says it must initialized using intialization function your camera . i take this mean don't rely initialization function card reader compatible your camera initialization requirements . i suspect some data loss problems some folks reported these xd chips ( whether type or type ) could traced their not initialized chip properly . my 2 gb type chip made korea samsung . my 1 gb type chip made toshiba japan . both branded fuji	1

they say , " little bit knowledge goes long way ... " if you live or near big city , this scanner absolutely no good because large metropolitan police forces use trunk communication system due large number units work one time . these systems aren't actually scrambled , but due high volume calls , it would hard single scanner unit keep track them so while you might able hear one end converstaion , you won't necessarily able hear other . this unit perfect smaller cities which use frequencies betweem 153.0000 169.0000 their police communications . unit also good tracking airport traffic , you know now , nascar events . best thing when scanning new frequencies access code book your area so you'll know what you're listening time . if you're technologically-challenged any way , you're better off letting someone who knows what they're doing program basic channels you . i like fact that it lot smaller not heavy its predecesors . it conspicuous mobile phone lot easier carry your belt without it getting way	1

my wife i owned this projector 4 months we couldn't happier . 108 " picture our setup bright colors true , even room light washed out our last projector picture . it can't compete sunlight ( what affordable projector ? ) but when sun goes down or curtains closed , picture rocks . since hd isn't availble our area , i can't report how hdtv looks , but 1080i picture my xbox my upconversion dvd player 720p picture looks flawless . i would liked see more connection options - least 2 hdmi ports would welcome . i also experienced error i gather my research fairly common : i shutdown projector , but fan wouldn't stop running . it happened only once it solved unplugging unit wall , but it black mark otherwise flawless performance . highly recommended . we couldn't happier	1

i love these headphones . they work great dvd , tv , radio especially my ps2 . vibration mode rocks when playing games . there some audible hiss when i put it into srs mode , but hey , price right , hiss goes away when i turn off srs mode . now i enjoy myself after kids wife go sleep i crank it up loud " i " want , they no idea . looking right price wireless headphones give good sound ? then give these shot . please note too i am only 10-15 feet away transmitter when i use these , so bigger rooms or if you want walk throughout house then these would probably not you primarily b/c there if wireless . well i hope i helped someone make decision easier wireless headphones . charger works fine me . i just take my time putting headphones base click there charging . good luck shopping !!	1

you probably reading reviews this product figure out whether it would good purchase decision . if you're like me , you've read reviews many similar portable cd players found just all them so many mixed reviews it almost impossible tell which ones truly better than rest . i fair honest possible this review . so i just made plunge bought this panasonic sl-sx480 ( blue ) cd player . truly , sound amazing . . sound alone makes this cd player worth purchase . bass boost system here four settings : off , s/xbs , s/xbs+ , train . i found train pretty worthless . s/xbs delivers sound comparable any standard sony walkman out there , s/sbx+ turns your standars earphones into simulated 4-speaker surround system ! amazing ! sounds like quality i receive my home car stereo systems . it this amazing sound makes next part my review all more difficult write ..... anti-skip feature poor best . " no skip " gross exaggeration . i use this cd player while work , i noticed within first hour use my cds skipping once every other song or so . this even discs brand new no scratches . puzzled , i referred my user manual checked make sure 45-second anti-skip turned . it . i went full 8 hour shift these clicks , pops , skips frequently occuring , irritating me more each time . finally , i decided just take it back . i replaced it sony d-ej010 ( white ) . took one home put cd it , only find sony idea " dynamic bass " utterly pales comparison . sound . i felt like i listening cassette , tones bass so poorly represented . so i took sony back bought new sl-sx480 , hoping skipping , clicking , popping my previous one suffered just glitch particular player , not problem model itself . so i just brought my new one home , put cd i just bought week ago ( no scratches ) . it skipped . you judge . buyer beware however . what you gain incredible sound , you sacrifice playability your discs . ready some skips . should this problem continue , i'll just go back phillips , which not let me down yet . also , cd player itself very light thin , i not dropped it yet but i cannot imagine it would very resistant hard use	1
there no instructions mentioned before but my biggest complaint card would not fit into slot back computer . usb ports firewire ports made wider than any standard pci card should . order get it work i squeeze metal top bottom each port down until it would fit into slot . very frustrating just wrong , looking other reviews though , maybe i just got fluke card . usb 2.0 ports work fine once installed i haven't chance try out firewire ones	-1

i've my th-37px60u couple weeks now . i bought it because i read many enthusiastic reviews very few negative reviews , particular consumer reports [ ... ] rated its 42 " brother highly . i needed panel would fit my cabinet . i originally planning buy lcd , but when i stores , i impressed colors panasonic plasmas . i recall seeing cooking show , someone doing barbeque outside , flesh tones so forth clearly better than neighboring lcds . plus , best lcd panels cost more than this panel . now i this my house , i confirm when i am watching decent hd show , picture really terrific . rich , warm colors , nice blacks make image seem almost three-dimensional . my local pbs station shows three hours hd programming every night , many these absolutely beautiful my tv . this signal right off air . tv native resolution 1024 720 , bit less than typical lcd panels ( but same 42 " plasma tvs ) , but images my tv plenty sharp , i doubt i would see much more 1080p . but i some regrets . first , you careful aspect ratios such when watching 4:3 material , or movies 2.4 : 1 format , because you don't want view things sidebars or letterboxes because risk burn-in . ( particularly " break-in " period 100 hours . ) so you find yourself switching modes lot non-hd sources . i've learned you zoom things bit get rid letterbars wide screen movies , it nice " just " mode stretches 4:3 material way lessens distortion center image . ( zoom adjustable , very handy . ) if you wish avoid this , watch things without any distortion or croppinig , you might happier lcd . second regret my progressive scan , component output dvd player very disappointing this tv . colors look lousy . i tried replacing dvd player one upconverts hdmi output , which didn't seem improve things much . i am not sure if this inherent tv or just i got lousy player ( or if there settings i wrong player or tv ) . if you large dvd collection you might need consider this . my last regret plasmas something called " edge-flicker " . if you look bright objects against dark backgrounds , you move your eyes , you might see flicker ( hint dull yellow or other color ) . panasonic support web site says this normal . this isn't bad " rainbow sparkle " dlp televisions ( which i see loud clear ) . i suspect few people notice it or care it ( i reason believe i am more sensitive flicker than most people ) . if you sensitive flicker , perhaps lcd would better .	1

this ( 60 gb ipod photo ) my second ipod ( first , g4 40gb pickpocketed my napsack nyc subway - beware ) i've it over year . looking over spate recent negative reviews here prompted me respond . most shrieking pans drooling raves divorced reality . i think it important point out ipod tool only tool - portable music player - compact digital device much common laptop computer . it highly configurable user many choices how encode music - which affects final results great deal . 1 ) scratching . front ipod shiny plastic . you'll need put it protective case . there extremely lively aftermarket . i bought nice silicon case compliant plastic panel covers display $12 ebay . it trick year later my ipod looks like new if i take it out case . protective case must considered manditory ipod . that it - now get over it . 2 ) all hard drive based devices any kind - ipods included - limited g-force tolerance . if you jog , it go into protection - ( music stops unit appears paused until you hit " play " again ) . if you drop it while it running , you might kill it - or cause disk damage require reformat . if you want player jogging or sporting ( skiing , skateboarding etc ... ) buy nano or shuffle or competing solid state player . memory chips no moving parts don't suffer these limitations . they just size limitation . 3 ) all electronic devices subject rf interference - especially digital devices . ipod nice metal body shield , but it crash when taken near power lines , radio transmitters etc ... 4 ) sonically all mp3 players vary quality based how much encryption you choose use . best sound use high bit rate ( 192k or above ) . apple offers proprietary schemes offer higher performance . competing open standards exist just every format apple cooked up . this skeevy apple ? perhaps . it similar what microsoft computers . love it or hate it - it part whole apple experience . i use apple lossless compression it works seamlessly itunes yields wonderful high quality rips . they portable any other deivce than ipod ? no . they work any software other than itunes ? no . am i complaining ? not yet ! i personally think itunes software best software ipod best player . down road if proprietary format limits me doing something i want i might start complaining . life full compromises choices . 5 ) you must turn off equalization if you care sound quality . sadly this true every portable digital player currently extant world . i expecting better apple - but it not so . every single equalization setting introduces audible distortion ruins experience audiophile like me . eq set off i get wonderful sound . 6 ) reliability dealing broken players - portable electronics take lot abuse . laptops shorter warranty periods than desktops because rapidly spinning hard drives don't tolerate motion well . this exactly situation ipod . it tough environment hard drive . there lively after-market hard drive replacement services . ambitious folks buy cheap replacement hard drives open market fix/upgrade their ipods . sure you'll scratch case getting it open - but it better than dead ipod . battery life issues - same situation . if you like tinker you this little cost . if you paying service it becomes more justifiable just buy new unit . this cost effective ? nope . but if you become addicted wonderfuly lifestyle one these players - you'll it . 7 ) audible distortion photo ipod becasue video jack ? maybe early units . i one don't any audible distortion when eq off . this unit sounds noticeably better than my 40gb g4 ipod . it better battery life too . 8 ) what music services ? it totally personal opinion - but i don't recommend buying music itunes or any other service . they all pretty much use relatively severe mp3 compression . buy cds get full resolution . then rip your choice compression . way you full backup you get all music you pay . i also feel music appreciation sometimes takes time . there many songs albums i didn't initally like , but grew love over time simply because i them because they album some more accessible hit . if we only buy hits - we never get know more difficult songs we end up shallower . i'll confess i'm dyed wool audiophile - kind who hangs sonex his walls puts specially made sound reflecting pillows his ceiling . i'm also , like lot audiophiles , opposed digital equipment general prefer warmer fuller sound analog sources ( like my very tricked out turntable ) . said - system shows you most one you use most often - me portable . years i high-end cassette tape walkmen , then portable cd players various stripes . ipod completely blows away all previous portables wide margin . ipod sounds way better than most stand-alone cd players - sonics comparable really good dvd player playing cds . this killer sounding portable when used lossless compression , etymotic er-6 headphones . it better resolution than my big rig ( rocksan xerxes turntable , audio research pre amp , proac repsonse speakers ) . granted this digital - so highs more brittle there less warmth depth . this highly dependent source material . recent recordings good engineers sound great - through headphones or played stereo system good cord via line out cradle . i get around 1500 songs - 135 albums worth my 60gb . ipod high enough sonically it function my test source critical listening back-end components or sharing music audiophile friends their house ( their big rigs ) . this " library " aspect biggest feature ipod - really life changing . i can't recommend it highly enough . my main complaint ipod headphones . included headphones not adequate musically satisfying listening . i recommend grado or etymotic headphones ( even bottom line ones ) . you don't need separate headphone amp - unless you source material unusually low volume . " earbud " type phones all garbage - avoid them like plague . other than - i'm really happy camper ipod	1
i agree case hard remove . like guy below , i panic because i could not open it again . but after i got it open it easier open after . so i suggest opening closing it few times before putting nano . nano fits snuggly case . dust still get inside so you might want open cleaning once while . case get tiny swirls minor scratch 3 weeks i've my nano . that what case so i'm happy its performance . so far , i haven't notice any scratches my nano caused case . this case also better than one sold agent 18 . this case crystal clear while agent 18 blurry/fuzzy quality . basically , countour design see through , agent 18 somewhat see through .. so this crystal clear case goes perfect my black nano . great thing this case you use earbud cord wrap around " hook " case allow you wear nano around your neck . i'm suprise how well earbud audio jack stays while you're wearing it . " hook " doesn't really work well my sony earbuds . apple earbud thick cord better . i haven't really used belt clip but it seems decent enough quality it hanging off your pants/belt . i would totally recommend this case . it its job keep nano protected . i haven't dropped it so i don't know if it pop open , but bunch reviews stated , it bit challenging pry open ;) so just remember open close it several times loosen it up . after this case work flawless	1

i am new world electric guitars , but playing acustic couple years now . so i bought new fender stratocaster , this amp . all i say holy crap this thing awesome . i don't even know what 3/4 little knobs , all i know i spend hours day messing around creating totally crazy sounds . this thing loud , i've only balls turn it little past 1/2 way .... when i this i tried playing talking my wife it useless , she couldn't hear word i saying . i can't imagine 3/4 volume or all way power . since i don't any experience effect pedals i really can't comment how built effects measure up , but rookie they sound pretty cool . i'm not sure i ever understand all features or how use them like professional , but that why i bought this amp cause i figured it would hard grow out casual player no aspirations performing public	1

i am absolutely pleased this cameras ability . i security technician over 6 years now install cameras well security systems , access control , networks , phone systems , ect . i'm not saying i know it all but i seen lot things hold very good understanding camera . 0.05 low lux excellent . this not meant night time camera . it designed operate very low light such parking lot streat lights . camera 704x576 resolution while still recording 10kb/s . most camera installed business companies only 400x300 or somewhere around range . others mentioned this camera freezing reviews i read , but not once since i bought this camera over month ago it froze . it took me minutes set up dcs-6620g my wireless network i not droped connection since day one . yes there camera out there cost more , but why spend money few extra features you " may " not need . i would seriously consider looking over this cameras abilities before marking it off your list possible choices . far technical support goes i can't verify either way . i small question one features they answered phone desirable period time ( tech support ) able help me . although , person sound bit busy if i just call . excellent buy , i know it bit pricey but i believe it worth it . just think it could worse , some wireless cameras go $1500+ .	1

this great wall mount shelf . there aren't lot 30 lb shelf mount speakers out there . i klipsch rs-62s weigh 26 lbs each , shelves accomodate them . down side one shelves sent screws no thread ! also you install thise into stud , period ! when you initially drill , make sure you find wood shavings drill bit comes out . when you install drill other holes , make sure you measure ground top wall plate assure speakers same height . also , make sure before you your drilling deep , level plate using level you buy any hardware store , so your speakers don't tilt one direction or other . make sure top side top put plastic cover before you attach glass , glass faced so rounded edge front ! good luck	1

i skeptical buying these speakers . after all , i replacing 25 year old 27x18-54lbs speakers . i impressed sound . we placed them 35x45 foot bulding ; 15ft ceilings . three quarter volume , they fill room clear , undistorted sound . they definatley worth every penny . i seen speakers cost more money don't sound good . good feature they indoor-outdoor speakers which good me because they unheated building . i would buy these again without hesitation	1

i ordered pepper pad 3 am process returning it . device great hardware point view . processor snappy , screen nice clear , navigation great . wonderful sitting around surfing net chatting . unfortunately underwelming software makes all tedious . surfing page all sudden either wireless driver crash or browser stop functioning properly . many software issues addressed 3.1 upgrade but trouble installing it no backup disks unable restore functioning version software . very cool hardware - not many umpc usable keyboard screen - part great . unfortunately tied pepper software there issues . if standard distribution linux implemented device would more functional . any attempts install other applications " user friendly " sort way futile . thunderbird no menu . firefox no menus . etc ..... built-in applications only option some those rudimentary best . talk example only supports aim poor job . if everything you plan doing web-based you're okay long none software bugs bite you . remote control some basic templates devices but if you any one off devices ( cheaper receivers/dvd players etc ) you'll spend time teaching it device your original remote - if you get work - never get remote learn my lg dvd/receiver . overall hardware good stuff - if someone gets linux distro working touchscreen keyboard would well worth it . but current state software i'd look elsewhere	-1

first all ... if you issue where you cannot change any items menu ... this : remote , hit " menu " button then press down arrow until you see " picture , " then hit enter , now hit down arrow until you see " mode " hit enter again . you should then see " power up " displayed . hit enter again get setting choices where you change mode back " home " if you showroom ... tv cannot changed any manner . i found tv actually higher standards than most reviews stated . clarity exceptional , it even picks up 13 hd stations via my antenna ; my last tv picked up only 6 . most hdtv standard definition analog signals not look well they " old " sets . however , olevia nice option where you take out some choppiness blocking setting . i would definitely recommend tv . i got it $749 would not take it back $800	1
somehow , i really really like this mp3 player . i like sony audio general they great job this one too . i no problems their software or hardware . it works even my 10 year old computer usb 1.1 . such small thing , this thing nice display screen , which makes it easy browse songs . fm great , it doubles thumb drive . it got sports timer , equalizer so many features . i considering ipod shuffle first , but didn't like fact it don't screen . headphones great i easily hookup my home pc speakers great sound ! only negative thing i see usb cap provided this player isn't attached player body it easy lose , but that not really problem , just got little careful . i'm surprised why some people written ' user-unfriendliness ' this player . i able pretty much everything it , i haven't read manual ( nor probably ;-)) . much better buy over ipod shuffle	1

i've this phone over month now , it works great . no problem interference or anything else . i think it great phone	1
my opinion , i think this pedal rulz ! it awesome soundand it really easy 2 use . even though it not include power source , i just picked up 9v @ dollar general dollar . 5 stars , easy .	1
overall this excellent portable , introductory 61-key keyboard . some things i like : 1 ) all buttons easy use . my #1 criteria . most keyboards , i think , hard figure out , but this one pretty intuitive . it easy change instruments , songs , etc . you not want lose instruction book though . there just few things i use rarely i need pull out instruction book remember . 2 ) split keyboard -- you play one instrument , like base or cello , left hand , instrument like piano , right hand , touch just few buttons . 3 ) built-in metronome learning . there also built-in lesson plan , but haven't really used it . 4 ) many instruments really good , especially horns organ sounds . 5 ) auto chord-fill . don't know how fill chord ? no problem . just hit any one or two keys left hand , keyboard fills rest chord you . some things i don't like : 1 ) " realistic " grand piano sound not particularly realistic . 2 ) volume very low , even plugged . i turn sound up 75% maximum get sound acoustic piano playing mezzoforte ( mf ) . surprised me given how large speakers . 3 ) piano not come any essential addons . not even power cord !! no midi cord . no sustain pedal . all these essential addons cost bucks . power cord $16 . add midi sustain ($40 $20 ) , you now add almost 50% price this keyboard . oh , don't forget stand , that not included either !	1
money you can't beat it . four kids i go through batteries case often issues generic brands . these batteries better than other generics i tried discount name brands . recommended	1
its level i think this processor just amazing ... eventhough your pc using over 50% it capacity , it still run other application any problem ... its really fast i recommed get better cooling fan than one it comes better performance ..	1
ok , so i've only this player 1 day . still , it exactly what i hoping it would . it plays all my " trouble " cds like home-made cd-rs some scratches . i love snap holds cover down . i love all buttons big directly front cover - very easy use . i went walk this sholder bag it never skipped . it auto-resume feature where if you listening cd then turn off unit ... when you turn it back it starts where you left off . entire unit feels very solid , like it won't break . i also like clean styling , no crazy designs , just good player . ~ user manual could little clearer , but little playing around everything makes sence . ~ one example it doesn't " stop " button when playing cds . you press " radio off " button . easy enough figure out , but it doesn't say manual . overall , great product . i'm very happy it .	1
i purchased this work my dv-camera some amature projects . i found sound quality some amature videos . i surprised great sound quality ended up using it some professional projects well . batter life also pretty impressive . i not think i changed out batteries over 20 hours use	1

mount works well . i read elsewhere people added velcro make mount more secure . i find if you make sure little plastic tab mount snaps into small hole gps , usually audible click , mount very secure . however , i must admit , i don't roughest biking ( jumping over logs etc . ) . i would given it five stars , but little trouble trying rotate handle bars . i kept tighten it up . seems firm now however .	1
great backpack if you're worried protection . it even fits my monstrous 10 pounder laptop too . problem i it it actually little bigger than i thought it going . part reason this i believe because it stiff ridge around it which protects laptop minor bumps , but it makes bag kindof wide . also despite it medium/large-ish appearance , it really cannot hold much extra if my laptop , charger , mouse there already ( given my charger size brick ) . it really won't hold much more than 1 inch binder all my other stuff . still , it nice bag if you don't need carry 50 lbs books , or whathaveyou	1

this my first home theater system . up until now , i using old kenwood two channel stereo two stereo speakers my old 27 " tv . i am no means home theater guru . we purchased this system go large screen lcd , it all-inclusive , i good experiences sony . all all , i would highly recommend this system , especially those looking easy answer home theater . i used hdmi cable run tv , only cable i buy . sound excellent ( my tastes , anyway ) , bass all i care my 20x20 living room . movies such x-men 3 come across exceptional channel separation . there may systems sound better , but money , this system awesome . now downsides : 1 . cables supplied 22 gauge use proprietary connections unit . it too much pain cut splice , so i ran them as-is speakers . sound still good ( loud i need , children home ) , but true audiophile needs prepared perform some cable surgery . 2 . my cox cable supplied remote not control receiver ( power volume all i needed) ! none codes i tried work , so i am left using two remotes power up all my devices . this may not sony fault , but it still sux . 3 . rear speakers not come angle mounts , but walmart cheap set $8 . they worked fine mounting rear speakers near ceiling . all speakers mounted flat wall , but if you wish mount front speakers wall angle ( instance , if you your tv corner ) , you make or buy some angled brackets . i ended up using miter saw fabricate some 45� brackets 1x3 " wood my walls . overall , highly recommended unit . some minor tweaking , this 5 start system . i not regret my purchase .	1
i primarily purchased this dvdrw drive edit/burn video taken my canon mini-dvd recorder . installation simple , i just swapped out my old hp cd/rw drive used included disc install nero dvd-playback software . drive tray action solid , overall construction seems good ( no lite-on this ! ) . read/write noise levels moderate , par other cd dvd drives i've used . discs recorded my canon using -vr mode immediately readable/editable , using included nero software allowed quick video importing , editing , writing full size dvd disc . i can't rate this drive long-term reliability , but since hp cd/rw drive it replaced lasted since 2002 , i'm sure this one go distance well	1

maybe i am only one who this problem , but we bought this backup our disc jockey service it extremely unreliable , if it works all . problem connections -- we use two video ipods occasionally ipod mini . even provided adapters supposed push slimmer ipods forward engage controls , none them connect properly . i put pieces folded paper behind adapters push them forward more , course , not make stable system when you trying play customer . controls often unusable because ipod not properly engaged or music just stops playing . video ipod also sometimes just pops out plug , again , causing music stop mid-song . i realize this not top dollar mixer never meant used professionally , but shouldn't it least play most time reliably ? i wouldn't recommend this anyone . it waste money	-1
