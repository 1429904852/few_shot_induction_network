i find it more than bit ridiculous pur charges 40 dollars their product 20 - 25 dollars their replacement filters . i owned 3 pur sink mounted water filters every one them ended up garbage within first year use . why ? because they begin leak faucet connection this leak grows progressively worse over time . tightening unit not help fact may make leak worse . removing reinstalling unit not help . i become so frustrated pur water products i never again purchase anything made them . i just installed brita filter my sink couple days ago no problems yet even if any occur brita more reasonably priced up 15 dollars cheaper sink mounted unit . yourself favor avoid this over-priced piece junk all costs	-1

accessory led version zelco excellent " itty bitty booklight " . assure brightest light eliminates need change batteries every few days .	1
there lot theoretically good ideas fail when executed . this one them . 1/quality:it made cheaply , even before it breaks , it flimsiness not inspire confidence . 2/resistance : levels resistance nothing real progression , anyone who ' seriously ' uses this too strong machine few weeks , ( many unchallenged right beginning ) . standard : if set longer than minute you still strength continue , you need more resistance . 3/compared crunches : there reason why crunches lying down : weight torso supplies fairly heavy resistance , whereas when you crunch uptight position weight torso actually helps effort , you dropping your weight down instead lifting it up . much what makes ab crunch machine ' work ' your weight dropping it , not your muscles working . this little piece plastic doesn't springs strong enough resist your bodyweight strengthen your muscles besides . ( you may achieve isometric contraction some effect , but you get -exactly- this effect , or -better- , without any equipment all ! just tense up seated crunch position minute or so . ) ... course , time product appealing public claiming how supposedly -huge- hassle lying down (??) crunches , we've reached real problem : this thing designed avoid effort . it seems though no one goes broke helping people avoid effort . unfortunately , exercise effort , more you avoid effort , less exercise you get	-1

worn out capresso machine after daily brewing 4-6 shots espresso making lattes/cappuccinos , etc . i went looking more durable machine . i bought x1 2001/2 when it brand new model ( stainless ) it great : 1 . it heats up quickly . 2 . it brews very consistently . 3 . ese thing best mess-preventer ever . 4 . separate steam-temperature setting great . heats milk much faster than other , cheaper consumer models . 5 . machine capacity steam enough milk least 3 tall lattes before needing quick " refill " water pump switch . 6 . i like simplicity total manual operation . switches aren't labeled , but there only 3 . kind morning meditation me . most important , non-obvious things : 1 . don't leave pod holder move temperature steam setting . when you unhook pod holder , steam instantly blow apart ese pod , which , given it more than boiling hot , hurt , plus dry instantly wall . 2 . use individually wrapped ese pods , unless you use them all within 2-3 hours opening tin . they sour very quickly , even freezer . i am partial starbucks pods , given my household addiction brand , but i think more preference than quality issue . illy tastes fine , but you use them all quickly . 3 . if you serve lot guests , double unit ( x3 ? ) might better . dual-temperature settings , you'll spend lot time running water through unit cool steam setting back down brew next batch espresso . lots refills water container , which bit pain remove back machine . overall , great performer after 4 years daily , multiple use . this thing great machine	1
chrome look this unit quite nice really look like chrome ( doesn't look cheap like some other metallic plastics ) , matching chrome fixtures nicely . but important part this filter really its job . you'll find pur website pur ulitmate nsf certified effectively filter 28 contaminants listed nsf standard 53 , whereas some competing products , including popular disposable model doesn't use cartridges , claim certification less than third those . i'm sure there truly comparable filters out there , but check specs before you buy . flow rate seems reasonable me . i fill up my 12-cup coffee carafe under minute , i don't mind taking couple extra seconds peace mind i'm drinking cleaner , safer water . after all , i won't needing it washing dishes or taking shower . it very easy install , it seems more durable than older generation pur faucet-mount filter i developed leaks after while . this one working almost year no leakage all	1

i brikka three weeks now think greatest ! it easy use , clean espresso comes out crema very hot every time ! i haven't any problems it all . few tips : order unscrew it cleaning , simply run it under cold water minute then pull valve inside top chamber up release pressure . then , it unscrew easily . also , you hear distinct noise when espresso almost finished . you look into top coffee maker see crema . this point , don't wait too long before you take it off stove serve , creme disappear if you cook it too long . enjoy	1

i bought this my wife who drinks six cups every morning ( finally got her switch mostly decaf ) . i first bought less expensive ( still @$400 ) machine which not automated . took it back when i realized it probably share space counter our current coffee maker using it involved additional tasks three kids we already enough tasks . jura-capresso works great - easy use , easy clean ( really only steam wand simple clean espresso or coffee fills cup ) no extra work . it tells you when empty grounds ( every 10 cups ) , fill water beans . it rinses nozzle automatically when it shuts down ( two hour auto shut down ) tells you rinse it ( pushing button ) when you power it up . i cannot think easier way coffee , espresso , cappuccino or cafe au lait anytime we feel like it . i especially like fact we not tied into using company pods ( paying premium wasting lot paper ) load any bean we desire or use bypass use ground coffee . two wishes - larger water tank ( or ability hook up water supply ) allowing angle steam wand move higher it pain put wand into larger mugs . but those just wishes - not gripes . two months no problems - just got steamer container came free but haven't tried it yet . great buy !!!	1
i keep this unit running throughout day my bedroom shut it off bedtime . ( too noisy me ) . i'm actually sleeping better/less stuffy . i recommend this filter anyone who some difficulty breathing easy night	1
this blender simply just powerful good looking blender so simple i bet even george . bush use it ( no offense republicans , i am one you anyway ) . this thing blend or crush or chop , or anything ( depending settings ) your frozen cranberries sticky gummy bears ( don't ask ) . no matter how many foodstuffs you mix different types or different stages matter it throughly blend them make smooth combo drinks or throughly spread flavored salsa or just knock out lumps pudding or gravy point it would cause french chief weep jealousy . i'm person who hates cleaning honest but simply this blender just easy clean despite what type mess i make blending jar or button counter sticky milkshake greasy gravy . i'm person who when i buy something i don't read instructions , i just try get feel how use it simply all this blender vast settings self-explanatory no instructions needed , so i got feel it no-time	1
i'm sure there cutlery snobs out there who would turn up their nose anything you find local " bedding bathing further " type store ... but this thing wicked . it huge , huge step up generic chefmate set i got while back . i cut tomato half quite literally accident , while old knife would take enough pressure deform poor little fruit or some sort sawing . think this introduction proper knives if you must , but i can't see reason get anything else ... unless it 10 " version ! incidentally , i chose this over wusthof , henkel , etc because handle fit my hand best i like " japanese style " blade no bolster . i'd recommend going brickmortar get feel options before buying	1

works better than other undercoat tools cost much more	1
when i got my gaggia more than several decades ago , it not yet called classic . it called coffee gaggia . 20 years ago , some minor changes made , unit renamed classic . new " coffee gaggia " not same this machine . this machine robust build , high quality parts . its tank heats water quickly , proper temperature , pump powerful enough job properly . i would strongly recommend using filtered water , especially low mineral content , so deposits not build up tank . my version all metal frothing wand , which good job skills operator allow . newer versions " turbo frother , " optional milk frother take guess work out frothing place foamed milk directly into cup . i can't comment these newer features , but perhaps they allow better job those less experience . newer models brushed stainless , while original models appliance enamel finish . since old finish allowed water penetrate under any scratches or imperfections finish , this particular problem near portafilter holder underneath drip tray . new version should retain its finish far longer , although old one still not show any wear places visible machine assembled . minor differences new machine more robust looking steam knob moved side , thermostat light , which indicated unit heating , replaced " ready " light integrated into coffee switch signals opposite . time i've my machine , i've only minor problems it . my steam thermostat needed replaced once , light my power switch stopped working . these larger issues before internet made it easy find parts , these items hard find locally . other problem if unit not used extended periods , tank allowed dry out completely , water used hard , then some parts subject clogging . troubleshooting steps manual not helpful these sorts problems . machine disassembled cleaning somebody who mechanically inclined , but unless you feel comfortable appliance repair , you better off avoiding situation using filtered water , and/or descaling regularly , especially before any long term storage . other " parts " issue gasket filter basket should considered consumable part , should sold every dealer accessory , rather than just repair facilities . machine really should included extra one since this only part definitely wear out regular use . it might take few years or longer , easy replace , but it wear out . overall , this well built machine should last you many decades . although it seemed expensive when i bought it , it averaged out 6 cents day own it , which well worth price , i'll probably get few decades out it . if you used cheaper espresso makers , you appreciate robustness quality this unit . features such three way solenoid controlled valve might transparent user , but lack them become clear when you use cheaper machine . this one just keeps going going .	1

after burning through several " cheap " vacuums , i bought this product confidence after my trepidation eased great reviews . i bought this 10 months ago now it dead . i live house wood floors only used this clean 4 rooms rugs . suction initially great first use i thought it broken until i discovered trap full ( duh ) . me sold but after last time i cleaned it out , it just died . i'm no dummy fixing things but why i bought " good " vacuum . well , $200 trash	1
these really beautiful glasses , incredibly light . we no dishwashwer , though , i broke one first time i washed it ( putting dishsponge down inside ) - i careful . these really , really delicate . my husband broke one next day . we also got white wine version these glasses , one broken upon arrival - still wrapped its bubble wrap . i no idea why bodum decided make these such incredibly thin glass . they're really beautiful , we love using them , but it ridiculous this careful them - i mean , we other wine glasses i used think delicate , but these bodum ones take cake . we also bought double-walled bodum glasses , those beautiful much sturdier ( although they're not wine ..... )	1
if your knives dull , chances you need sharpen them before you need hone them . get diamond-impregnated steel such this one . this steel quickly sharpen your knives . don't try sharpen your knives honing steels come most knive sets or popularly available or you'll wreck honing steel well waste lot elbow grease . they say use steel least long your knife . i don't any 12quot ; knives , but i like little extra room error ..	1

i adore this coffee maker ! i've read reviews , i've used one ( not mine ) seven months daily ... all no problems . owner machine i am using warned me make sure push filter door until it clicks firmly before assuming it ready brew . she stated she problem filter only once , she smart enough figure it out never problem . if i any complaint this system all it would when it begins cycle 4:30 a.m. , grinder wakes up everyone house . when i know i get up early , i just grind beans myself night before . no big deal . i love this item am here purchase one myself ... i'm buying reconditioned one , because , somebody else couldn't figure it out , sent it back i'm only going pay half price because i'm smart enough know how close filter door ! funny how it manufacturer problem every time consumer too limp read directions . here your sign	1
i bought this after i read it recommended author " cat vs . cat " . i 3 cats - stuck-up prissy female , obese lazy female , psychotic energetic male . i love this thing ! i am so amazed very happy all 3 them love this toy ! my stuck-up cat usually never plays cat toys , only strings , pens , straws . my fat cat just never plays , but obsessed watching out window talking birds . male , however , born feral cat colony , but bottle fed my step-sister . he endless energy . before i even got da bird out its package he excited ( other two sleeping ) . we started playing , soon fat one came downstairs see what going . before long , i my two females playing it , put male room . only thing you might want consider if you cat who over possessive or wild , he/she may destroy feathers before normal cat would . my male cat so nuts over this , he actually tiring himself out point panting . problem when he would actually catch da bird , he not let go growls , so other cats don't want play . really , if you think it , wild cats ( some domestic ) catch birds then take them off eat , but long you don't allow them get aggressive it , you should fine . i definitely recommend this toy . sure you keep this somewhere your cats can't find it when you aren't playing them .	1

i've this grinder over two decades it performed well . when i first got my machine , i wondered which setting number would good cappuccino , or any particular grind . manual said since coffee vary variety variety , or even one roast , it matter adjusting each batch beans . perhaps 34 settings , people found helpful , but i found my beans consistent enough adjustments necessary type coffee , but left alone particular type coffee particular variety beans source . time i got machine , i got my beans peet back when they five stores no other distribution channels . although they larger chain now , they still small enough roasting well controlled , they still buy beans single source variety meet needs chain . beans other sources , where roasting variety locations , or beans differing sources , you might need pay more attention adjustments . much bigger issue affects strength everything else dosing . reading other reviews , it not seem changed since i got my unit . top unit filled beans , part over dispensing area fill up remarkably consistent grind . round area divided into six sections , like wheel spokes . five sections get filled grounds . one section empty , above dispenser . each time lever pulled , wheel rotates one position clockwise , one section gets dispensed through empty section . theory , if unit full , amount coffee each section would consistent . chances real life , you would not want fill unit up home use , since grounds would not fresh time you use them . if you grind just enough few cups , then coffee not end up compartments evenly , dosing counting pulls not work . if you lift lower lid , you see where coffee , you likely see small mound back partly filled areas toward front if you grind smaller amounts . you could redistribute things brush , but even way , some areas would end up more compacted than others . or you could merely gain experience know how much dispensed compared how much you need , pull handle accordingly . option gring lower lid off . you watch grinds fall into compartment , you rotate each compartment gets filled , dispensing you go . then you become consistent once you develop good eye it . whether you want consider dispenser poorly designed matter perspective . if you believe this unit designed grind beans two cups coffee , then it would fair conclusion . if you believe this unit designed people who prepare 6-12 cups hour , you might think it just fine . if you believe it designed higher level fairly constant use , you would probably not disappointed . but since this unit most likely home users , it hard claim dispenser ideally suited task . experience let you know how high grounds supposed when you put them filter basket , it not going take you long learn . while this unit not fool proof , chances you not fool , so things work out . me , bottom line once you know correct grind setting your beans , unit more " set it forget it " than what instructions said , least consistent beans , but dispenser lot less " set it forget it " than what literature implies . personally , i prefer unit takes guess work out getting grinds right consistency , since it easy get amount dispensed right eyeballing it . this unit very well respect . i use this conjunction gaggia coffee ( now known gaggia classic ; new gaggia coffee different machine ) two make good pair . learning how much coffee dispense minor part , compared learning how long hold switch espresso machine , or how froth milk perfectly , but ultimately , it boils down knowing how make proper espresso . if you tell when stop water based color coffee coming out , then bit more or less grinder affect how full cup gets rather than taste your brew . you can't automate perfect espresso , but you use correct tools allow you make one experience	1

this pot rack easy assemble included dozen hooks . no need order expensive extra hooks ! rack sturdy functional . despite its compact size , it held 6 pots 5 frying pans ( some which very heavy ) , wire strainer basket , without looking over-crowded . bulk weight held single center screw top . i believe this screw must hit stud , due tremendous weight it bears , so plan center rack stud . i'm not sure anchor through drywall would adequate , unless you plan hang only few pans . two other screws sides hold rack swaying . wire grid makes cute shelf plant . all all , this quick , easy , attractive solution overcrowded kitchen . great value price	1
it beautiful mold , i excited make cake shape sunflower . i am pretty experienced baker , my success rate , even tricky procedures , very high . five attempts use this cake pan , each ime increasing how slavishly i greased floured alleged " non stick " surface , careful remove it per instructions - after cooling 10-15 minutes rack after removing oven , i never got it out one piece . mold detailed corners too sharp cleanly release cake . i even tried letting it fully cool hopes some shrinkage would help get cake out . i own other nordic ware pans better luck them , but this particular mold loser , which very disappointing considering how pretty it could potentially if it worked . if you want use it jello , i'm sure it fine , but cakes , it waste time money .	-1

rival� slicer ( model 1060c ) generally well designed unit . i say generally because there appears , my unqualified opinion , one major design and/or manufacturing flaw associated product . first unit i received broken speed control knob prevented any speed adjustment . this unit exchanged ( thank you amazon making process painlessly easy ) . this second unit also broken speed control knob , failure point identical first . stem speed control knob either woefully under designed or it forced into wrong position ( it detent ) during assembly . this really too bad since unit looks like it would job which it intended quite well . what good this product : - heavy-duty construction ( parts i expected plastic made cast aluminum)- heavy-duty , thick stainless steel blade - removable cleaning- angled slicing surface- tray catch slices what ever- cuts up 5/8 " slices- integrated cutting boardwhat not so good this product : - there rubber suction cups four bottom corners protect surface unit sitting hold it place while it used . this would great feature except suction cups stick surface pull out unit when it lifted up . - speed control knob stated above ( sole reason number 1 rating )	-1

this really cool concept , poorly executed . clear sleeve slides up down aluminum cylinder . top cylinder rubber gasket seals sleeve , thus preventing leakage sleeve cylinder . all works fine . problem bottom aluminum cylinder plastic ring larger diameter than cylinder . this ring stops sleeve sliding below top cylinder , also acts foot so you stand measuring cup . unfortunately , ring made fairly hard plastic , which become brittle crack . but it doesn't break away cleanly - so you're left measuring cup won't stand up straight . might fine if you're measuring things dumping them straight into bowl , but if you sit thing down while it full , forget it	1
litter locker great , i keep it next my omega paw litter box which i also highly recommend . i got mine online large chain pet store ... its basically spool inside , each turn wheel wraps bag into this spool . think garden hose ... most folks complain refills not last . hopefully they not tossing them when they empty device . biggest problem " spool " litter become too big spin inside locker , most people may think they empty it totally replace refill . you actually just empty spool once week or every 2 weeks , just not replace bag refill until it actually empties ! simply cut bag toss litter , tie it off then use same refill again until it runs out . i expect get around 6 weeks out each refill this method 1 cat , maybe longer	1
this measuring cup very difficult slide clean . it much easier spray regular measuring cup non-stick cooking spray help release sticky things such peanut butter or honey . spend your money good set traditional measuring cups	1

mentioned reviewer , this item critical flaw : it just too short . it can't used bowls over few inches tall , small plates small pile food , cover touching food . this especially troublesome when cover used prevent splatters ... dried splattered food inside cover happily mingling food your plate . other than , it its job well prevents splatters . but i simply don't enough instances where i use it . ideally , more versatile , cover should least twice it current height , which why i'm continuing my search	-1

ice cubes come out intact - not chipped or cracked . get them out , push each cube bottom your finger . fastest easiest results , wait 5 minutes after taking tray out freezer . this way , ice cubes pop right out . if you don't wait , your fingertip freezing while trying push them out	1
i agree previous reviews this dispensses honey way too slowly . additionally , it much too difficult fill without making mess , since you cannot top open without bottom open well . this dispenser just not worth trouble mess , no matter how great idea	-1

positive : great ! great ! great ! i spent weeks going over reviews comments electric food slicers preparation replacing one i using 25 years . it heavy , clunky would slide around counter when used . i only took it out use when nothing else would work . but it slice . after reading all i could reviews , i decided model 632 seemed best fit my use . cooking hobby not profession so i needed nothing more than good quality , home slicer . i decided keep new slicer counter while so i could try it out . i think it found permanent home . i find i am using it almost every day bread , meat , cheese vegetables . operation smooth caliper dial , very repeatable . it stable not " walk " counter when slicing . it appears well manufactured durable . several reviewers pointed on/off lock switches locations problem . i find just opposite true . their location both logical easy use . though i don't use it often , i found little extra i paid tilt table worth cost . overall , it met and/or exceeded every expectation i prior purchase . negative : if there downside , it would component parts not dishwasher safe . this nothing more very minor annoyance , since unit comes apart very easily requires little or no effort clean . ( just use caution when cleaning blade . ) overall : i may find problems future , but present it gets 5 stars plus . my opinion , good buy	1

i've owned several cheaper toaster ovens , they always fizzled out , only good making toast , not baking . i decided buy something high end , i am glad i . i wanted something smaller than my oven bake , this job well , i made pie turned out perfectly baked ( 9 " pie pan fitted perfectly ) , several other baked goods . secret convection baking degrees need lowered 25 . ( i.e. 350 325 ) i've only this oven few days , but i am very impressed satisfied performance power this toaster oven .	1

i went this fryer , ( replacement well loved much used unit ) , two basket feature . this reason first star . true , it take 5 quarts oil but frying 2 baskets one time . problem arose two baskets one time . temperature cranked up max 375 degrees , two one layer baskets chicken wings took over twice amount time needed fry greasy . second batch after waiting full 20 minutes assume maximum recovery those still fried much longer than needed time wise weren't up level old machine got them . clearly one immersion element can't pull off heating much oil . next fries . greasy . very greasy . again i allowed extra time oil temperature recovery . worse part heavy oil smell air . it required whole night leave kitchen made entire family shower immediately after dinner . we all felt like we worked double local rat trap . this unit doesn't replaceable charcoal filters but permanent metal one . it nothing absorb odors . this new oil nothing ' smelly ' cooked . only chicken fries . it returned store next morning after cleaning out , ( thus second star because it easy clean up ) . it traded rival . gave up half fry space but what incredible difference	1

addition all beautiful words said le creuset i want add several things i haven't seen anywhere else . first , oval shape pot this size preferable because it easier lift ( you hold pot closer your body ) . also it fits better oven . 5 pound duck fits perfectly 9 1/2 quarter oval pot just enough room left place some cherries or oranges around . second , le creuset became some sort cult ( i saw couple large french ovens emeril show other day . ) if you into french , cajun or just any rich cooking you just least one . third , price seems high , but then i saw some fifty year old le creuset ovens sold auction list 25% what they would cost new now . think it investment . forth , colors . i disappointed beginning find out they only sell this size white or french blue . but when i received my blue oval oven i loved color . picture catalog doesn't it justice . this large pot red ( my initial choice ) would looked like fire truck . i since added couple more blue pieces those who interested starting their tableware collection , this color coordinates beautifully denby reflex pattern	1
i bought this pot new used it once steam some fresh green beans . i shocked after using it one time , inside bare aluminum . dark grey " hard anodized " finish completely gone . my caphalon hard anodized cookware just gets better use . beware this phony product	-1
this mid-priced line henckel knives , called quot ; classicquot ; company , full-tang , single-piece , three-rivet line sturdy black plastic handles . handles notched end prevent hand sliding off during use . although they not razor sharp right package , their edges sharp enough average cook . according henckel , all knives this line dishwasher safe , but you should expect more rapid dulling under harsh conditions . slicer long straight blade curves up gently two-thirds way toward tip . tip extremely sharp , allowing exact easy puncture begin cutting . this knife balanced evenly blade handle make straight slicing more comfortable . this useful blade kitchen , it great both slicing melon carving meat .	1
.......... i paid too much these knives , though they work well . i should shopped around	1
very well worth cost(imho it worth far more than it cost ) . just wish i would seen knife like this hollowed edged earlier(i don't think amazon it , but it only $8 more different site )	1

after little experimentation water coffee measurement grind , this clever machine delivered rich , intense espresso minimal effort ( including cleanup ) . ( pace atypically disappointed reviewer , it " true " espresso : hot water forced through finely ground coffee high pressure produces , name would imply , espresso , although crema slight or absent , probably because microfilter . i've espressos wide variety machines domestic commercial , including one little eagle top , jerked them living more than once . aeropress not approximation ; it makes delicious espresso . ) components seem sturdy well-machined . i found steel chopstick easier stir than paddle-shaped implement provided aeropress . if you're no-throwaway purist , you may interested know microfilters rinsed reused indefinitely . they're too inexpensive seem worth effort , but it neat feature not mentioned online product descriptions	1

i agree some other reviewers unit runs hot side , but we've ours several years it still working great ! my biggest complaint it so good sucking up dust particles filter quickly clogs won't pick up larger items . then filter needs banged out order restore suction . it great vacuuming stairs cars small things ... but i usually bang out filter 2 or 3 times when doing stairs or car . kind pain , but same time it reassuring know it getting much dust out carpet . i would not use it big jobs , but think it works great small jobs . biggest issue trying track down replacement filters ... when i find them i usually buy couple	1
i purchased one these see if it would better than doing it hand ... boy it ever . it works even better than i'd hoped . clean up easy expected . my only complain would container plastic ; metal or glass would hold chill better , making better foam . but if you want , you use different vessel ( metal or glass ) would work fine , so my complaint pretty minor	1

rice our staple food - no kidding , it really . i all different kinds rice bins my pantry - long grain , brown rice , par boiled rice , sona masuri rice basmati rice . i cook rice everyday i never completely happy any one rice cooker all these years . i tried several different kinds , sanyo , aroma , zojirushi etc ., there always something each these , uneven cooking , big splatters , bottom getting burnt , so so forth . i finally got this one , recommended friend . * perfect brown rice , white rice pulav/pilaf . * absolutely no splatters . i intentionally put 1.5 cups extra water nothing came out - rice overcooked , but different story . * even though lid not detachable , cleaning easy . part it due shape ; fancy looking rectangular ones such pain . i'd say crappy design . * cooking vessel definitely thicker than most cookers out there . never burnt bottom even when left warm several hours . * i don't crank up my big oven baking small cake . this cooker it ! complaints really minor . * weak lcd display . * cannot cancel timer if you change your mind . you go increments all way max then start counting again . * not come bigger sizes .	1

i expecting this machine cook rice very well based previously owning neuro fuzzy logic rice cooker made zojirushi , which i've worn out after many years use . i'm very happy new induction heating style cooking . it cooks brown rice better . pro's--exceptional rice results , almost foolproof . -- multiple menu settings account most types rice , including gaba brown ( which supposed make brown rice even healthier) -- easy operate . select menu setting , add cups rice bowl ( rinse rice ) , fill applicable mark bowl , hit cook button . -- battery backup . lithium battery means cooker remember its last settings even if you unplug it . if you're creature habit , this feature makes it even easier operate . -- clock timer 2 time settings you set based clock time . like previously stated , cooker remembers timer settings until you change them . i leave my cooker set rice ready 6:30 a.m. ( pack lunch work ) or 5:30 . ( dinner ) . con's--water level markings pan based 6.2 oz cup provided ( ~ 3/4 cup ) . don't lose cup ! -- expensive ( my justification it saves me $5 every time i pack rice lunch instead eating cafeteria) -- takes longer cook rice than equivalent stove method ( baking or stovetop) -- timer military time only ( so when i said timer set 5:30 p.m. , it actually 17:30 )in summary , buy this machine if you want use timer function . if you're type person who only remembers things last minute or don't like plan meals ahead , keep your money get pressure cooker or good pot instead . it fits my needs perfectly , so i give it 5 stars . i also recommend zojirushi lunch jar system if you want use this make rice lunch work . lunch jar keep rice warm moist , so you don't microwave it .	1

i prefer eight-inch knife over ten weight reasons wide series gives lots knuckle-slide area repeated chopping tasks . i've owned wusthof-trident knives since before graduating culinary school over ten years ago . fact , i still own all but one i still use daily ( one stolen ) . knives hold edge better than any other i've used ( i've tried 98% what out there ) , stand up continuous use comfortable enough use all day long . you'll never sorry owning wusthof-trident knives	1
when aeroccino works , it works great . it quick quiet , produces excellent foam . clean up very easy . but , there something inherently unstable aeroccino machines . since august , i managed kill three them i am not sure why . part it nature machine : because it constructed like water kettle , one should not submerge it into water . but because it designed heat milk , manufacturer allows putting it under running water long bottom machine remains dry . if you get bottom wet ( you ) , machine either trips ( heals itself after fully drying ) or dies . i suspect , my first two aeroccinos died such deaths . my third one died today . i frothed milk it , refilled it tried again ( without cleaning ) machine not work . i tried again it worked 20 seconds stopped . i tried again couple hours later it worked 10 seconds stopped . i am not sure why it so , but i suspect it magnetic foaming brushes you must insert into machine make it work . if anyone ideas why this so , let me know . positive side i keep calling company they keep sending me new machines . i really like aeroccino when it works . but i suspect it good old microwave when i finally run out warranty .	-1

i like this knife , i really . however , it truly functional santoku knife , it scalloped edge so your food doesn't stick blade . handle also really light doesn't same heft or balance , say , henckels 5 star series would . small grip somewhat uncomfortable people larger hands it doesn't any texture so it difficult use if hands bit wet . this first knife i grab slicing up meat fact it keeps razor sharp edge nice . however , if you own one knife your kitchen , i would not recommend this .	1

i bought this set my significant other christmas . i looked around wusthof , global , few others but liked unique look feel these better . i also figured these would more comfortable easier wield female . end result she really enjoys them . although she fairly large hands woman , handles fit her nicely . knives come very sharp hold their edge long time . it interesting see how well they take professional sharpening . overall , i am happy i purchased this se t.t here one caveat . i also quite bit cooking large hands . after using shuns couple months , i come conclusion wusthof grand prixs fit me better feel sturdier . i cannot really justify two sets expensive knives around house , so we keeping shuns . my advice : go sur la table or williams-sonoma handle knives yourself . feel weight , notice handle shape , decide what fits you best . there so many quality manufacturers cutlery now it hard go wrong any selections	1

i really like my bodum coffee presses - i two sizes , delighted see i could replace beaker separately . but watch out if you order replacement beaker . my small one holds 3 what i think ordinary cups , so i ordered 3 cup replacement beaker mistake . looks like my small one actually 8 cup unit , my big one ( which hold 5 my cups ) 12 cup unit . there no info bodum itself how big it , so if you don't remember , it takes some guesswork figure out whether you " 3 " , " 8 " , or " 12 " cup bodum . study measurements carefully get closest match . oz held easiest way tell , but course if beaker broken you problem .	1

i've used this waffle iron 10 times so far - waffles , french toast or grilled sandwiches . it works fine . only thing i don't like it handle lifting top . grooves run front back when lid closed ( top bottom when it up ) . several times i trying lift lid handle slipped my fingers causing lid come crashing down . if grooves ran sideways instead , this wouldn't happen . i'm thinking filing some cross-wise grooves improve grip	1

this mug combines best elements thermos more traditional travel mug . when sealed , it not leak carried like thermos keeps my coffee hot until i'm ready drink it . use it mug easy pushing button top drinking . it doesn't handle , which i find annoying mug . it proportioned well terms dimension , its appearance compact . i've it few weeks , so i don't know how hardy it . most new items include plastic , it slightly creepy smell makes you wonder what exactly entering your body , but smell now dissipated	1

bodum tea infuser wonderful item ! whether you making cup tea or pot tea , infuser easy use , easy clean-up . one big downside company selling infuser not include lid - - it missing shipment . spite this deficiency , infuser itself works great - - since i seldom let my tea sit very long after making cup , lid not essential .. although it would nice view paid it . i find this infuser much better than those " tea eggs " filled , then screwed shut , opened same way dump out after use . carefully crafted stainless steel also sure last years regular use	1

i calibrated outside sensor using supplied probe container ice water . it appeared accurate within degree . default channel 1 interfered cordless phones ; resetting it channel 3 solved problem . if you need full complement remote sensors , this might become serious issue , depending what other equipment you . main unit hangs single screw . it requires use buttons its top look high low temperature records , reset them , switch remote sensors . pressing these buttons tends make unit rotate around screw ; i not yet figured out how solve this problem , unit come down replace batteries	1

while i loved features this timer , especially ability run multiple countdowns once ( i bake lot varying baking times require concurrent timers prevent errors ) , my unit started freezing ( apparently common problem this model ) after 6 months use . buttons indeed flimsy pressing them little hard often would cause unit reset itself , losing any all countdowns already progress . this unit not inexpensive ... i'd rather separate ' single ' timers next time , especially model not know freezing up . i dot not recommend this time	1

this board beautiful , perfect size next my sink , so far worn really well . it functions not only cutting board but staging area dishes after eating . i treated it mineral oil when i got it , which brought out grain even more . i highly recommend this one	1
i read lot reviews before i bought this most them weren't very good . i took chance bought it anyway because it easiest brand find store . my oven broken so i needed one these right away . i don't see what problem actually i love this crock pot . i didn't any problems it leaking or lid not fitting . heat seemed appropriate setting . maybe i got lucky ? price , i think this crock pot perfect . i wish they made this size programmable . i'm not really sure why they don't . would my only complaint but i still give it 5 stars because i got what i bought i'm very happy it	1

i really like this product , especially affordable price . here positives negatives i've experienced ... pros : 1 . boils water fast it quiet too . perfect office . 2 . great safety features . you really want cordless unit easier/safer filling pouring , auto-shutoff on/off indicator light work exactly described . also , spout mesh shield plastic guard prevent water splashing out while boiling . overall , no need worry accidents . 3 . plastic view-window volume markings both sides unit , so you see water level any angle . 4 . convenient storage : relatively small footprint , cord wrap base , minimize counter clutter . cons : 1 . it takes 2 cups water cover heating element , which less convenient if you just want cup tea . 2 . cord only 3 feet long . fine kitchen counters , but less so if you're using your office wall outlets/power strips . 3 . lid mine sticks one side , so i push snap it into place ( might just mine though ) . overall i really like this kettle quality convenience . you find pricier ones , but money , this one all necessary features then some	1

excellent quality rich color . i tried it skillet , takes while heat up . . . i think this would best oven roasting or saute onions , followed stove-top roasting . very heavy , course , lid , too , heavy enough hold juicy steam . this large piece . you could prepare meal four . you want smart how much you move this around . hand trouble , i've learned use straight wrists carry it close me ( when cool , course ) . then i take water or food piece , cook serve it right off stove . . . cool down , " hug " it sink . i used smaller pieces similar brand smaller meals . care , this should serve you life-time .	1

i just got this iron yesterday linens things using their standard 20% coupon you find all time newspaper . i tried it out cotton shirt got job down five times faster than usual , less work , no wrinkles . shirt looked like i got it back cleaners . i also elna ironpress , which also saves time , but i think i prefer using rowenta steam iron since it steams material while you iron it , it get into more nooks crannies . note rowenta engineers -- it would nice if water tank level indicator let you know how much water it . this would help when you fill it so prevent overfilling . option would removable water tank you could take over sink fill . also , if this typical high quality rowenta product , why only one-year warranty ? why not five or ten years	1

we using this heater over month now , it powerful little heater . i wanted get ceramic heater because i read they safest space heaters you buy . this important because you here lot horror stories space heaters causing fires . heater three settings low , high auto(ranging 900-1500 watts electrical power ) . low setting heater puts out 900 watts . we usually use it auto where you set handy digital thermostat set temp . unit maintains temperature , you either set it unit or using handy included remote control . i surprised see how well this unit heats 220 square foot space . i would recommend this unit confidence , my only issue unit not expect it save you money over other space heaters i.e. oil filled electric radiators . my electric bill seems gone up using this heater over previous oil filled electric unit same manufacturer . i say , this unit heat room much better then previous unit , largely due fan dispersing heat	1

i haven't completely gone through manual yet , but item installed first try quite easily , despite my setup one more unusual ones , both heating cooling listed exceptions part wiring diagrams . it works well intuitive enough interface i just set it up left it going . already saving me time money over my old thermostat . nice unit	1
i used this item 10 times total over four month period . battery not work all any longer . not buy shark product if you intend using it longer than few months . absolutely awful product life span .	-1
these my favorite cutting boards . cuisinart makes 3 cutting/prep boards , round , square rectangle . i bought them set all together , i use least one everyday . they dishwasher safe so clean up couldn't easier they not dull your knives , absorb odors or collect bacteria . they all slightly raised around edge so liquid not spill your counter , perfect tomatoes or anything else you chopping . i actually just ordered second rectangle one . you even use them outdoor serving , fruit , cheese , etc . highly recommended ! a+	1

hi .. if you reading this looking new or replacement filter , aquaclears great . my 70 ( 300 ) extremely quiet my aquarium crystal clear . even though filter comes sponge , carbon biomax , you set it up which ever way you want . sponges washed aquarium water save few dollars maintain your biological filter . cleans easily . old number represented gallons per hour . new number represents maximum size aquarium . good luck	1

i love these dishes ! proportions , color vibrance , surface wearability chip-resistance can't beat price ! i suggest buying few colors mix match , these dishes come so many great colors ! if you're considering lesser-priced set ( i ) , spend little bit more , extra quality classic style definitely worth it	1
not really , unless you add up what i would paid all coffee i made it , starbuck prices . but it more than paid it'self many , many times over . sure , it small , but people who complain it too small should realized they talking euro sizes , those darn europeans drink out some really tiny cups . microscopic , actually . i carry it me everywhere i go , it perfect size . i lost count how many times i used it , least ten million times ( not really ) . i love little rubber boot , which apparantely not microwaveable according one unfortunate reviewer , comes off so i sit it directly burner bunn coffee maker quick access hot water work . i also love secondary filter lid , once you get your technique down you never grounds your coffee again . this something cannot said other , more expensive brands french press . it well worth money i paid it . i say already ?? hell , price you should buy two case you manage break one , although they tough nails . i guess you could break it , nothing indestructible someone who puts their mind it	1

beriner not perfect mandoline but it more useful , more tasks than large french mandoline i also . it light , easily transportable used more professional kitchen stations than larger metal version . you throw out finger guard moment you get it . like any other tool it requires care . dish towel better finger guard you get bitter end carrot or zuchini . one drawback it not cut thicker than 1/8 inch . you could not push celery root through it or even tough carrot long way(you , but it requires poise ) still it only 30 bucks it lasts forever . outside dense root vegetables , it great . one my favortie tools , my vita prep , cryovac machine immersion circulator	1

we purchased this item after looking our options wine refrigerator . this model perfect size our needs . we entertain friends family kitchen/dining/family room open concept . cosmetically , it blends nicely without overly prominent attractive enough i wouldn't hide it away . it holds temperature , well , unlike prior smaller model . removal box some minor " assembly " racks handle took ten minutes before we plugged it began noticing thermostat reflecting lower temperature . i'd suggest this great gift or addition casual kitchen where space may issue . we very happy our choice	1
this set all quality good looks i expected . there only one problem-it big ! 11quot ; plates so tall my dishwasher they only fit center my kitchenaid dishwasher , so i can't wash more than 4 once , bowls don't slide prongs , but kind lean over , so they take up extra space . i got rio set partly because 16 oz . mugs ( my husband serious coffee drinker ! ) . i love design , but plates bowls really way bigger than any person normal-size appetite needs	1

i've using this machine good month now , i'm very happy it . while i'm no stranger espresso , spent many dollars my local coffee houses , this my first home espresso machine . it only took me few attempts get decent espresso , not much more get hang steaming / frothing milk ( not sure frother attachment , it ok , but i'm sure purists would tell me replace wand high end one ) . if you want real espresso , you can't find better starter machine . most cheaper models " steam " machines , resulting strong coffee reminds you espresso , but not real espresso . this one solidly built , brass grouphead portafilter , strong pump . boiler aluminum , but this advantage it heats fairly quickly . i usually turn it before i take shower , it nicely heated up when i return . if you don't like waiting , after 5 minutes you pull couple blank shots through , which should ensure everything heated well enough make espress o.o ne safety comment , very careful metal drip tray when cleaning it . when unpacking my machine there lot adhesive goo drip tray so i went sink scrub it off . it turns out , edges tray rather sharp i cut my finger it . since then i've bit more careful it haven't any issues , but normally all it takes quick rinse tray plastic tub underneath it get it fairly clean	1
price am not too surprised quirkiness this machine . others mentioned , there tendency it push out lot water one time not great job sucking it back up . this said , however , i've developed few tricks minimize these issues . 1)getting right angle handle takes while but once i get into groove , i find holding handle certain angles helps suction problem . 2 ) if lot water comes out once then i just push around instead trying keep just one small part my floor wet one time . it clean water tank so i don't feel like i'm just pushing around dirty water . then handle trick i'm able suction up water over larger area fairly quick clip . 3 ) if i don't patience or time dealing larger than desired volume water i just fill clean water tank half way get go this seems prevent problem . 4 ) i use murphy oil soap my wood floors . here , trick use fraction amount required bissell recommended cleaner . i use maybe quarter amount if i'm using murphy full tank water . i'll use even smaller amount if i'm using less than full tank water . not use too much murphy's; it oil soap too much causes dirty water tank fill overflow bubbles ( yes , i've learned this experience ) . despite quirks , my wood floors look great after i use this machine price i'm not sure i could expect quirk-free machine . if i space i'd buy heavier duty more costly machine , but my 790 sq ft apartment mostly wood flooring this ok .	1

i received this unit first week november 2006 . valentines day it toast ( no pun intended ) . first it worked fine . i used it warm end our big living room near front door where it almost always cold . i set thermostat 3/4 maximum left it work . it also completely quiet advertised . then , sometime january , i noticed on/off knob turning brown near edges -- if discolored excessive heat . i turned it off investigate . then turned it again . nothing . unit dead . after repeatedly turning it off i noticed sparking underneath switch . after repeatedly spinning switch off/on it would finally come back would stay 2 or 3 days until it failed again . after 10 days this i unplugged it out fear my family safety . now it waits my garage until i take trip dump dispose it . what giant hassle 55 dollar heater ! don't doubt second honeywell counts people not wanting hassle returns . example electronic device made cheaply possible little or no regard quality or safety . it cold day you-know-what before i purchase anything else honeywell . i better find me quality heater soon so day never comes . -30-	-1
i bought this pressure cooker after much thought research i just gone through very bad experience investing expensive pressure cooker [ manttra 5-pc . stainless steel multi-cooker 8-qt ] then it just stopped working all because its whistle went bad after just 3 months !! it heavy bulky complicated unlike presto ! so i simply looking light hassle free cooker which also didn't cost much . i finally found it presto ! its light weight , very roomy . i'm small sized girl [ 5'2 ] i personally needed something which not high narrow me comfortably cook it . presto not high or narrow all , its roomy giving me plenty comfort cooking ! its totally hassle free . i wash it dishwasher comes out just fine clean . don't over fill cooker i.e more than half cooker water which goes all pressure cookers otherwise it burst . also don't leave it unattended very high heat . instead try cook medium heat always . overall i love presto pressure cooker i bought i would recommend this others too . if you looking tension free light weight cooker , which also great bargain price , there it . its definitely worth more than money it costs	1

key keeping your beverage hot ( after you first make it hot , place it surface ) , lid coffee mug . i found coffee cups lids world market ( ala cost plus ) carlsbad , ca . kind chinese use formally , only 5 bucks . i think if someone starts making coffee mugs lids ( perhaps lid lifter like they use beer steins ) , it would sell well . my beverages stay way hot all day platform , long i'm using ceramic lid . thats key folks , use lid least heat stay it gets hotter liquid your cup gets lower . keeps my coworkers warmer , so hopefully less flu go around	1

i crossed my fingers when i purchased this cart because mixed reviews . worse case scenario , i'd just return it . i'm pleased say i am quite satisfied cart . i find it very sturdy ( bottom shelf holds up 44 lbs ! ) . assembling it , i initially put bottom shelf upside down ( lip should toward floor ) . this mistake made cart very unsteady , but soon i turned it right side up , everything came together like glove . it handsome piece lots storage space . i keep my crock pot , rice cooker , blender bottom shelf clear counter space . keeping these ' heavy ' items bottom shelf locking whells also steadies unit so it doesn't move when using sliding adjustable-height top shelf . i'd recommend it . hope you found this review helpful	1

we lot fun this fountain couple parties . it little noisy , but you won't notice it if it larger party . everyone loved it asked where i got it . i bought it bed bath beyond $40 using one their 20% off coupons come mail almost every week . i used semi-sweet chocolate chips ( tried nestle ghiradelli ) generic canola oil . i let fountain run 5 hours without problem . i noticed i add little extra oil when i first started get it flow smoothly . you also make sure it completely level . you make sure chocolate smooth before you put it otherwise it won't work . i overcooked some white chocolate chips when trying melt them . they wouldn't work . if there couple clumps still your chocolate after taking it out microwave , just continue stir until completely melted rather than keep putting it back microwave . that how i overcooked white chocolate . we used wooden skewer sticks many items . we tried marshmallows , oreos , nutter butters , dried apples chips , pretzels , fresh pineapple , kiwi , strawberries , peaches , marshiano cherries , piroette cookies , regular pringles . home we tried something fun - banana slices , strawberries cherries dipped fountain then used canned whipped cream - banana split . lots fun ! you really get creative	1

i've always curious this product , despite owning no longer manufactured bissell steam mop , when this went sale target , it magically jumped into my shopping cart . i 3 very active little children who like dump dish detergent floor then squeeze ketchup into mess . we two dogs cat , all which enjoy shedding amazing amounts hair . my house constant state chaos . anything enable me clean up sticky , gooey , dried bananas mountains pet hair more quickly ? i'm intrigued . we approximately 1800 hard flooring main level our home . some it tile , some it sealed bamboo ( like hard wood ) . all it quite regularly smeared yogurt . i own dyson which spoiled me other vacuums forever , so i highly skeptical vacuum feature this product . but i surprised . dry vac decent job . i tilt it back get it eat cheerios bits dry noodles , but it certainly picked up debris pet hair . it not get into corners up against cabinets furniture very well , but it fit under my cabinets which my dyson no t.t he vacuum quite noisy . encouraged dry vac results , i followed directions , mixed cleaner filled tank . i emptied canister collected dry stuff clicked over wet vac section . it just noisy , course . i started my laundry room . very short time i reached front my kitchen sink ( not even 1/8th way through my hard flooring ) , tank empty . well , that inconvenient . i refilled it wondering if i squeezing lever releases cleaning solution too frequently . i wondered if i could least get through rest my kitchen casual dining room ( all tile ) before reaching great room where bamboo flooring started this second tank . no go . i out water again time i hit dining room table . it took me three times long not even complete job normally takes me 30 minutes broom my bissel steam mop . hoover floormate least no effort push around , but i go quite slow , go over over over areas bissel could blow through seconds , since directions encourage you go over sections again ( without squeezing lever ) squeegie extra water up aid drying , it just took ridiculous amount time . it okay job cleaning , i guess . i think this product would ideal if you live home without ton hard flooring maybe without such active ( read : messy ) household mine . i'm thinking my mother would like this . overall : pros : - very easy push around , takes almost no effort . easy back . - okay job cleaning . not so great tough stuff like dried banana or apple sauce ( yay flung baby food ) . - low profile , fits under cabinets . - light weight . cons : - way noisy . wouldn't dare use this hallway while kids napping or asleep . - water tank too small or lever releases more solution than really necessary ? my bissell steam mop reservoir seems much smaller but i get entire main level tank half . - slow process . you go quite slowly get it clean really well . - no little side brushes like dyson so it misses crumbs pet hair up against wall or cabinetry . - obnoxious clean/empty reservoirs . maybe bissell ( i can't stop mentioning it ! bissell ! bissell ! ) spoiled me , but no extra solutions , no holding tanks clean . - my steam mop cleaned better , i finished job steam mop tired amount time it taking mixing expensive solution ( i realize others said i use other cleaning solutions ) .	1

my mom gave me this popper several years back ( i'm talking , several , when microwaves still novelty ) i still use it . i normally don't leave reviews , but i'm grad school now , without microwave oven , looking air popper saw some folks not given this popper love it deserves , so i must point out it beauty . let me start telling you i use zero oil , so concentrators , i bought two little bags ten ( they couple bucks each ) i've only ever used three them . long they're clean dry ( no oil ) you use them over over again . its bowl shape allows easy storage . pop concentrator disk out , dust it off , wash bowl dry it , store disk back bowl you even stack other bowls inside it . nice ! i also tell ya i hate plastics -- i won't drink plastic water bottles , i don't store my food plastic containers , etc , but this dry product , very little condensation lid make popcorn soggy . all , i find this thing absoluetly great ! it easy clean , lasts forever , if you get pack or two disks you'll probably never run out . ( i used one disk maybe 30 times)one downside : you need microwave that above 500 watts little dinky ones -- if you call your oven " medium " sized , then it work . i one those low low wattage ones it never could pop corn . worth every dime . healthy popcorn too -- no oil/fats/butter etc . takes 2:50 my oven -- there never old maid !	1

i went local bed bath beyond find silent or near silent humidifier . salesman introduced this air-o-swiss best machine market . he added venta-sonic same job but costs $50 less , all other brands can't compare . i bought both units compare . air-o-swiss clear winner , hands down . two machines sat side-by-side . it clear immediately everyone air-o-swiss quieter . even highest setting , air-o-swiss ' noise level frequency lower than venta-sonic , they blend nicely into background . they don't give me headaches venta-sonic . lower settings , air-o-swiss virtually silent . air-o-swiss , i slept very well . next night venta night . unfortunately , base machine noise just bad first unit i returned earlier noise problems . i tried go sleep it but after few hours , headaches agitation noise made me shut it off switch air-o-swiss slept through afterwards . i kept alternating units days nights observe results continued operation . after three days , venta-sonic unit began add strange squeeking noise . air-o-swiss gave consistent good near silent performance ... going strong still . just based noise-level alone , i return venta-sonic even though air-o-swiss costs $50 more . but extra costs further justified following : 1 . consistent performance - i put air-o-swiss automatic mode preset humidity level before i go sleep , when i wake up , my bedside humidity reader ( far away machine ) within 1% margin error preset desired level . venta-sonic however , i put it max settings , i get only around 32% sometimes other times anywhere below 50% . 2 . greater output capacity - my bedroom 300 square feet+ , half 600 both machines claim cover . air-o-swiss comfortably reaches my desired level ( b/w 40% 50%) lower settings ( it go high 75% , i only set it up 50%) . venta-sonic labors over 8 hours max settings gets me less humidity ! it won't get me above 50% . 3 . ease use digital control - i like air-o-swiss ' auto mode desired humidity setting . machine adjusts output automatically . venta-sonic only two dials , you'll experiment while find optimal settings . soon atmospheric humidity changes , which daily or few hours , you'd re-adjust again ... that like shooting darts dark all time , you get close if lucky but never target . 4 . better mist venting notch design - i put both machines 3-fee t-t all dresser . air-o-swiss ' notch tilted higher than venta . this means when operating cold mist , air-o-swiss disappears into air vs . some venta still hit floor - not enough form condensation but less efficient humidifying - perhaps contributes venta lower output previously mentioned . 5 . better craftsmanship - venta-sonic notch below air-o-swiss , appears made simpler cheaper . filter changes clean up similar . venta needs change filter cup . air-o-swiss needs filter cup once-a-year silver stick change . both fool proof . venta filters more expensive but air-o-swill extra silver stick . cost-wise it similar . i like air-o-swiss option replacing resins - just dump old resin filter cup put new packet you get new filter - this cuts cost almost 65% less trash environment . water tank design similar . both fills water upside down . i still prefer air-o-swiss because top more leveled , easier sit sink or bath tub than venta tilted top . when moving venta-sonic , water spilled base tank . i no problem air-o-swiss . anything air-o-swiss improve ? sure ! humidity reader machine adjusted 13% lower than actual average room humidity . they probably it ensure average humidity far away unit reaches target , but i think they so internally without show it . it would mistake read room humidity off machine . after i got machines , i googled both . there one review elsewhere saying venta-sonic broke after month half , out store 30-day warranty owner took loss . air-o-swiss 3 year warranty , if i remember correctly , venta 1 year . trouble i went through worth finding right humidifier me . hope this helps those similar concerns !	1

le creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels well other products . le creuset casts these cooking vessels molten iron poured sand moulds used only once . this reason , one pot may look like , but each unique its own way . cast iron highly efficient material which absorbs distributes heat efficiently . it recommended cooking cast iron low medium heat . however , there exceptions like boiling water where cooking high heat appropriate okay . remove cast iron heat it not cool off quickly . this heat retention helps your food stay warm while serving . beware ; iron tends heavy so these cooking vessels . cast iron effective material cooking so why cover it enamel ? iron tends rust ; iron oxide ( rust ) doesn't add any complimentary flavors your food . if your cast iron cooking vessel not enameled , you would season maintain your cooking vessel . adding porcelain enamel not only looks good , but multiple benefits . enamel , solid coating , one most hygienic surfaces cook , not stain , absorb odors , retain flavors , easy clean . enamel damaged , so limit cooking tools plastic or wood . benefits cooking le creuset cast iron many , but lets get down buffet casserole specifically . buffet casseroles one most versatile pieces le creuset lineup . use this pan saut� pan , roasting pan , poaching , or shallow braiser . 3.5 quart capacity plenty space when it comes casseroles , so consider your recipes when determining size you need . buffet casserole tends best if least three quarters full . any less you may overwhelm your food evenly dispersed heat pot . large flat bottom curves up this pan resembles curved sided saute pan only thing missing would long handle . tight fitting lid mostly flat curved sides . this lid seals heat , moisture , flavors used hold your meat while you making sauce drippings . its shape design makes this extremely versatile pan . i tend use this pot basic dishes like smothered pork chops more than anything else . but once you get past basic functionality lends itself recipes such paella , frittatas , deep dish pizza , casseroles , you really open up possibilities . keep mind this 3.5 quart pan , feeding two out if it ridiculous unless you want leftovers . it probably perfect size family four most cases . try baking pineapple upside down cake or bread pudding when you need please many guests , poaching fish , or mac cheese . possibilities almost seem endless . one feature people tend complain cost . cost seem steep compared other pans made other materials . heck , cast iron doesn't seem like it should expensive when comparing old cast iron pan past generations used cornbread camping . however manufacturing process requires making mould each every pan produced . they then go through enameling process before shipping these heavy pans . if you take what goes into making distributing these high quality cast iron products , cost tends make sense . then consider this pan easily last lifetime when taken care . pros : extremely versatile efficient absorption distribution heat hygienic enamel cooking surface not stain , absorb odors , or retain flavors easy clean when not abused or misused transferred stove top oven table easily last lifetime cons : its heavy , cast iron tends weighing 12.25 pounds	1
. . . this glass , course , good tequila . resident mexico four years tequila obsessive , i tasted over 70 different tequilas ranging $5 $175 per bottle . riedel only glass allowed me fully smell , taste , enjoy tequila , only glass recognized consejo regulador de tequila , mexico fda tequila industry . my quest enjoy best tequilas lowest prices , i purchased cheaper wine flutes just every other glass i able find resembles riedel shape ; all , however , no avail : this glass singular construction unmatched tequila . unfortunately , these glasses not created equal : i owned 16 these glasses , , time time , i come across poorly finished glass -- unsightly stem seam , rough lip . moreover , this glass confounds all attempts describing color tequila . finally , these glasses not cheap , nor they very strong -- my two-year-old son i managed break twelve already . nevertheless , this , least moment , only way drink tequila . those search perfect tequila , i would like share some recommendations after spent thousands dollars my own search . but before i begin , i wish urge all tequila drinkers give serious consideration boycotting cuervo sauza . these u . . -owned megacompanies bought up huge amount agave mexico consequently inordinate influence production price agave , cuervo especially destructive . competition become very difficult other , less financially powerful producers , who going out business/selling off . depressing me cuervo recent acquisition don julio , whose 1942 among my favorite tequilas . before you buy these behemoths , consider what they mexican farmers , smaller tequila producers , ever-rising price tequila . now , few recommendations . keep mind price object me , i most my tasting mexico , so i not able try some very expensive tequilas or tequilas export only . also , note i not included tequilas impossible find u.s. no particular order , then , my recommendations : 1 . azulejos anejo ($90 per bottle ? difficult find , but worth searching out , this tequila among most flavorful best-balanced ( i.e. , agave oak ) anejos i tried . 2 . don julio 1942 anejo ($100 per bottle . okay , it owned cuervo now , it bit overpriced , its flavor strays agave , but exceptional complexity mind-blowing ) . 3 . el tesoro de don felipe anejo ( $36-40 , strikingly pure- full-flavored anejo , this tequila more readily available u.s. than mexico ) . 4 . chinaco reposado ( around $40 per bottle , solid , pure tequila , arguably better than over-the-top oaky anejo ; this tequila artesanal flavor ) . 5 . casa noble reposado ( i able buy this around $40-$50 mexico until , like increasing number tequilas , it apparently became available only export no longer mexico ; this tequila sells around $60 u.s. this tequila probably best nose any i've sniffed ; unfortunately , however , this tequila one those house flavors permeates every tequila its fabrica , la cofradia , makes , not everyone necessarily like ) . 6 . corazon anejo ( apparently export-only , selling u.s. anywhere $47-60 . this one better middle-priced tequilas , notable its balanced complex flavor , which edges out don felipe ) . n.b. perfidio back production . i bought bottle $120 mexico . some call this best tequila ever made , but i found it so carmelized , delicious it , it ceased seeming tequila . it , however , worth trying . enjoy	1

i'm using this unit my bedroom , which getting very dry some colder days this winter . it works very well . morning , before leaving work , i set fan low , humidistat 40 . when i get home , i raise humidistat 50 . when we go sleep , i turn it off . this because our bedroom very small even low , it bothers my wife . please note we both agree it very quiet low we able sleep it turned past . it could when it set humidistat , cycling fan ( off ) interrupts our sleep . days which not so cold , we don't run humidifier . while i personally don't notice variations humidity , my wife feels difference right away says air feels much better when it running hour or so . we've this unit little over one month it works like champ . water supply not 11 gallons i think -- would huge unit . but it plenty our usage . we fill every 2 3 days . buy extra filters protec pc-1 cartridges . there warm spell week half , during which we not use humidifier . it still winter , i not pack unit away or drain water . i checked filter before using it again found three pea-sized areas where mold just started . my opinion , this extremely good - i expect bath towels left this situation would entirely covered mold mildew . me , it means filter acts advertised -- microbial protection doing its job . since i extra filters , i decided replace old one anyway . paranoia set because we hadn't swept or mopped bedroom over three weeks because way air drawn into unit , i'm sure some dust near floor pulled caught filter . don't get me wrong - problem not design unit , problem we've negligent cleaning our bedroom . air drawn 6 7 inches above floor when assembled included caster wheels , which definitely high enough areas simply moderately clean . this unit meant much larger space ( our bedroom 12x12 ) it pump out lot moisture quickly quietly . all all , this excellent unit : high capacityvery quiethigh outputhumidistatinitial investment cost effectivereplaceable items inexpensiveblows moisture 270 degrees direction , not uni-directionallong electric cord	1
