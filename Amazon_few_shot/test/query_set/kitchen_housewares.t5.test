one might imagine whole concept vacuuming-flip-mopping progressive some way , but it really not make job cleaning floor easier . especially when product heavy hard maneuver poor pickup . i'd much rather go over floor good vacuum , then follow functional , well-designed good mop ( like old steammop they discontinued ) . these things function better seperate units , which why there no washing machine that also dryer . flip-it very loud machine -- so loud , i didn't hear my phone ring same room . this makes it difficult listen my 3 children , too . it difficult push feels like it gripping floor . it doesn't fit into any tight places or under any low chairs/cabinets it big fat part-vacuum head . , when you're finished , it pain clean out nozzle filter(which you're supposed keep dry somehow ) so you look forward second job once you've finished job cleaning your floors . , because " flip it " back forth design , thing no equilibrium ... it fell floor least 3 times , even when i so careful rest it against something ... once when this happened , " dirty water " recovery tank hit floor , fell off machine spilled dirty water all over my just-cleaned floor . true nightmare . i bought this product because i could no longer buy replacement filters/pads my bissell steammop , i thought i better give latest greatest try , but , sadly , i disappointed . i don't review things often , but i felt responsibility warn others out there who shopping good mop keep their homes clean . this contraption not your answer . side note , i wrote bissell bring back steammop ( what excellent product ) , so i'm hoping they one day	-1

why oh why i buy this useless thing ? i perfectly good cuisipro mesh 13-inch screen , which what it supposed , namely reduce spray grease spewing onto burners , walls , floor . it perfect ? no . but it definitely most job , which what i can't say tovolo . it three fatal flaws . first , working end detachable metal handle proportionally too small securely safely leverage screen off . i use one hand steady metal edge lid -- hot hot hot -- i tried wedge handle under screen lip my other hand . second , count number air holes silicone screen . then , count holes metal mesh cuisipro , or its ilk . purpose screen catch grease , this important part , allow steam escape , otherwise water vapor condenses back onto food . i first tried using tovolo saute ground beef . beef began stew water dripping surface screen . third , too much grease escapes around edge screen because metal rim bows heat . all fairness , mesh type bows also , but not much , possibly because edge thin more pliable . this product , imo , just one more silicone kitchen gadget not work well metal version . save your money buy old fashioned kind .	-1

unique looking soft polypropylene body contrasting chrome ; distinctive attractive item sits plain view kitchen all time . normal bread before lowering , bread sticks almost 1/2 way out toaster , making it very easy remove hot toast , toast smaller items ( plunger go up even further assist ); slots extra wide so , although i not used sandwich cage accessory , i see how there enough room make sandwich toast it cage ( apparently british idea , maybe something worth investigating ) . i am doing normal toast only setting 2 , bagels 3 separate bagel feature they come out perfect !

le creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels well other quality products . enameled cookware cast molten iron formed sand moulds which used only once . this reason , one pan may look like , but each unique its own way . cast iron highly efficient material which absorbs distributes heat efficiently . this reason , it recommended use low medium heat . there few exceptions like boiling water where cooking high heat appropriate okay . otherwise , cooking high heat may cause food stick , discolor enamel coating , or cook food unevenly . remove cast iron heat it not cool off quickly . this helps your food stay warm while serving . beware ; iron tends heavy so these cooking vessels tend heavy well . cast iron effective material cooking so why cover it enamel ? iron tends rust ; iron oxide ( rust ) doesn't add any complimentary flavors your food . if your cast iron cooking vessel not enameled , you would season maintain it . adding porcelain enamel not only looks good , but multiple benefits . enamel , solid coating , one most hygienic surfaces cook , not stain , absorb odors , retain flavors , easy clean . enamel damaged , so limit cooking tools plastic or wood . benefits cooking le creuset cast iron many , but lets get down roasting pan specifically . this pan holds 5 1/4 quarts food , measures 9 3/4 14 3 inches internally , weighs 10.2 pounds . 5 1/4 quarts typically feed 8 - 10 people when it comes casseroles , so consider your recipes when determining size you need . except roasts , roasting pan tends best if least 3/4 full . any less you may overwhelm your food heat evenly dispersed pot . i find cast iron adds crispy texture food may desirable dish like mac-n-cheese , while not so desirable other dishes . add le creuset 9 11 1/2 inch roasting rack roasting chickens pork loins keeping them out grease . some other possibilities this pan include casseroles , pork chops covered cornbread dressing , dinner rolls , baked squash , lasagna , scalloped potatoes , cobblers , pineapple upside down cake , or bread pudding . possibilities almost seem endless your imagination . one feature people tend complain cost . cost seem steep compared other pans made other materials . heck , cast iron doesn't seem like it should expensive when comparing old cast iron pan past generations used cornbread camping . however manufacturing process requires making mould each every pan produced . they then go through enameling process before shipping these heavy pans . if you take what goes into making distributing these high quality cast iron products , cost tends make sense . then consider this pan easily last lifetime when taken care . pros : extremely versatile efficient absorption distribution heat hygienic enamel cooking surface not stain , absorb odors , or retain flavors easy clean when not abused or misused transferred stove top oven table easily last lifetime cons : its heavy , cast iron tends weighing 10.2 pounds	1
many you reading these reviews may wondering how this compares similar items made cast iron . i tell you , while it obviously isn't cast iron reason alone many say it inferior , it still excellent griddle . bottom very heavy it conducts heat well . it fits perfectly over 2 burners one side my gas stove . i've cooked several sandwiches once it well pancakes some eggs , heat seems distribute very evenly . i very impressed this aspect griddle , cast iron known its even heating i wondering how aluminum griddle would hold up ; it definitely fine job . bonus , course , nonstick surface , it good one , not some chintzy teflon coating . good quality construction . handles solid it doesn't feel cheap all when you hold it . take care this griddle ( make sure it doesn't get scratched ) it take care you	1

if you pets constantly dragging out your heavy vacuum cleaner , then you love this one . i bought this vacuum supplement my large ( heavy ) canister vacuum pleasantly surprised its ability pick up pet hair . because small bagless chamber , you empty it frequently , so i wouldn't count this vacuum my only vacuum cleaner . i wanted lightweight vacuum use my hardwood floors area rugs , specifically pick up pet hair , this vacuum exceeded my expectations . i tried shark , similar model made fantom , cordless vacuum not one them worked anywhere near well this one ( stay away fantom cordless - far worst !! ) . i don't think any cordless vacuum enough power pick up pet hair like this one . overall , this vacuum great little vacuum quick clean-ups or maintain pet-hair free area rugs . one suggestion - use carpet setting even bare floors . brushes high enough so they won't scratch bare floors , but cleaning capability much less without rolling brush . i found it just rolled over dog hair without picking it up unless i used carpet setting . only reason i not give it 5 stars because small holding chamber which requires frequent emptying .	-1

this lovely little crockpot whose small size makes it uniquely useful number purposes . i've owned larger crockpots couple decades ( currently 6 quart rival smartcooker my mainstay preparing family-size meals ) , but larger pots take up significant amount counter space aren't all useful heating or re-heating small quantities . this little crockpot , however , perfect heating or re-heating 2-4 servings soup or stew . i originally bought it , however , because it * absolutely perfect * making hot cereal cold mornings , especially those hot cereals require more than few minutes cooking microwave or stovetop , such steel-cut oatmeal ( try nutty goodness traditional steel-cut oatmeal once ( also available here amazon ) you're unlikely ever return instant or " quick cook " oatmeal again ) . there nothing nicer cold winter morning than walking into kitchen knowing healthy , delicious hot breakfast awaiting you . mid-october late-march , virtually every night i prepare my entire family hot breakfast cereal next morning this little crockpot , no more effort than required make single serving instant oatmeal or cream wheat microwave . other uses we've discovered : it perfect making serving hot mulled cider ; keeping hot dips , gravies warm sauces syrups heated buffet ; substitute fondue pot ; heating soup times when hovering over stovetop or near microwave would incovenient ( how nice come inside raking leaves or shoveling snow hot bowl soup ! ) . single people or couples who prefer not cook large quantities or apartment dwellers limited storage space , this crockpot would very acceptable slow cooker , especially if used conjunction rival inexpensive sp100-pdq smart-part module ( also sold amazon date this review ) , which provides same timed-cooking controls integrated many rival larger , more expensive crockpots . energy used minimal , too -- only 80 watts -- stoneware bowl fits easily dishwasher , lid , very convenient clean-up	1

i'm proud celiac chick finland , but i'm also lover homemade donuts . now , those you who don't know what celiacs , we can't eat any wheat or gluten . plain-speak ( no , i'm not implying you're stupid ) , we can't eat flour . it runs lines allergy , although experts gladly look down their noses tell you it not . so how heck i eat donuts when they're made completely flour ? answer my cooking angel , bette hagman , who wrote up donut recipe one her books , more gluten free gourmet . anyway , i use recipe . however , i don't use this donut mold like i'm supposed . no , i don't baked donuts-what donut if you don't indulgent full-fat thing ? i put batter into three molds time , tip it into oil , i deep fat fry those little suckers . god , they good ! so , my ultimate point here this donut mold extremely useful , more ways than one . so grab one -- especially if you're celiac -- put your imagination cooking skills work	1

le creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels well other quality products . these cooking vessels cast molten iron poured sand moulds which used only once . this reason , one pan may look like , but each unique its own way . cast iron highly efficient material which absorbs distributes heat . due this efficiency , it recommended cooking cast iron low medium heat . remove cast iron heat it not cool off quickly . this helps your food stay warm while serving . beware ; iron tends heavy so these cooking vessels tend heavier than other pans made alternate materials . cast iron effective material cooking so why cover it enamel ? iron tends rust ; iron oxide ( rust ) doesn't add any complimentary flavors your food . if your cast iron cooking vessel not enameled , you would season maintain its cooking surface . adding porcelain enamel not only looks good , but multiple benefits . enamel , solid coating , one most hygienic surfaces cook , not stain , absorb odors , retain flavors , easy clean . enamel damaged , so limit contact wood or plastic utensils eliminate scratching scoring porcelain . benefits cooking le creuset cast iron many , but lets get down roasting pan specifically . this pan holds 2 1/2 quarts food , measures 7 3/4 11 1/2 inches internally , weighs 6 1/2 pounds . 2 1/2 quarts not lot space when it comes casseroles , so consider your recipes when determining size you need . this may pan families 2-4 . except roasts , roasting pan tends best if least 3/4 full . any less you may overwhelm your food heat evenly dispersed pot . i find cast iron adds crispy texture food may desirable dish like mac-n-cheese , while not so desirable other dishes . add le creuset 7 1/2 9 inch roasting rack roasting chickens pork loins keeping them out grease . some other possibilities this pan include casseroles , pork chops covered cornbread dressing , dinner rolls , baked squash , scalloped potatoes , cobblers , pineapple upside down cake , or bread pudding . possibilities almost seem endless your imagination . one feature people tend complain cost . cost seem steep compared other pans made other materials . heck , cast iron doesn't seem like it should expensive when comparing old cast iron pan past generations used cornbread camping . however manufacturing process requires making mould each every pan produced . they then go through enameling process before shipping these heavy pans . if you take what goes into making distributing these high quality cast iron products , cost tends make sense . then consider this pan easily last lifetime when taken care . pros : extremely versatile efficient absorption distribution heat hygienic enamel cooking surface not stain , absorb odors , or retain flavors easy clean when not abused or misused transferred stove top oven table easily last lifetime cons : its heavy , cast iron tends weighing 6 1/2 pounds	1

i've gone through number grinders over years am hoping this kitchenaid last longer than others . grind consistent quite adjustable . even glass container , there still static causing cling sides dispersal grinds counter . small price pay fresh ground coffee . because it slower , it quieter . flavor brew better because beans weren't heated when ground . read instruction manual happy results first time . commenter says kitchenaid replace hopper or receptacle later design works better . i'm thinking following up ... beans didn't feed through , but only one time . so i upended it shook beans back down all fine again	1

i waited years buy calphalon cookware because i under false impression its quality . i old set . . waterless cookware made ecko ; ecko set outperformed calphalon every measurement . my thought buying new set ecko cheap , calphalon quality . every thing sticks this set , pork chops even stuck so called non-stick surface pan ; no chops not right fridge , would cause them stick . some pans without non-stick coating dimples metal . box states they dishwasher safe ; however instructions state differently . electric stove one pans developed burn marks bottom pan over medium high heat . list goes , if you contact customer service you get canned answers send cookware them your cost ; they not read mine . oh they tell me i could keep lids , no wonder they not fit ; you move them 1/8 " back forth . not buy !	-1

after conducting research few weeks , visiting amazon , well other coffee aficionado sites , i finally purchased saeco aroma espresso maker using it going two weeks . although this machine may not glitzy appearance compared some machines , it make great espresso . say instance , if francis francis sexy ferrari espresso machines , then aroma would volvo -- boxy ( perhaps considered bland appearance some ) but solid , reliable , well-built machine price . once i got hang using pressurized portafilter , which put tightly obtain correct seal/pressure , i treated rich , flavorful espresso lots crema . i am pleased ease using machine , however , instructions not very detailed i found technical support slow . initially i placed phone call -- where i not reach live person -- but left message . never received call back , but called again next day which time i get live person . honest , she seemed ambivalent downright unhelpful , blaming my problem coffee i using ( despite my best efforts explain problem ) . issue after priming machine installing portafilter , pump would run run , but no espresso would come out . i ended up tightening three little screws bottom portafilter , which seemed help make it fit more snugly achieve pressurized seal . voila ! perfect espresso . if i one complaint this machine , it would portafilter not very substantial , made mostly plastic . aroma steam wand works really well frothing milk . almost too well , i ended up lot foam , but second time using it , i backed off pressure bit , got just right balance milk foam . overall i am pleased performance this machine . it hard find decent machine under $300 . but i would consider this machine mid-level machine entry-level price , especially 15 bars pressure . ( i started out thinking i would buy starbucks barista machine which almost $400 , but after seeing live demo starbucks store , realized it not perform well only 8-12 bars pressure . very little crema ) . good espresso machine should offer minimum 14 bars . two side notes : i urge anyone who purchases espresso machine consider conical burr grinder ( i bought capresso 560.01 infinity burr grinder amazon ) . it crucial fine grind brewing espresso . you'll know when you just right grind because after brewing portafilter basket contain compacted " cake " espresso , rather than soupy mixture water grinds . i not purchase my saeco amazon , but opted instead get it costco website where it $249 ( members or add 5% - or $12.45 - nonmembers ) , including shipping handling . plus it could returned any costco warehouse within 30 days , no questions asked , if not satisfied .	-1

these pillows 6 months , finally drained them threw them out . you don't realize once you fill them water how heavy they ! once they place bed you can't move them ! try lifting them when you change sheets !!! but , you probably bought them due bad back , neck or shoulders now you lift these weights make bed ! what i thinking ? i lucky i didn't wind up traction lifting these things . my husband refused use it after few weeks , said he couldn't get comfortable unable move it easily ( they weigh ton ! ) i hung there longer but wound up using regular pillow top it just able adjust it without get crane lift it . we honestly didn't feel any better sleeping it deal weight them not worth any benefits we might derived . no one mentions this issue their reviews , i wonder if they all maid service	-1

you really can't drink coffee mugs which come this coffeemaker , unless lids off mug ... definite design defect which defeats purpose travel mug . it very simple oversight : there no quot ; ventquot ; hole mug lid , so coffee barely dribbles out sipping hole , even when mug full , even if you tilt mug high if you drinking last drops bottom mug . it very frustrating experience . please also consider two cups may not fill up evenly coffee brews ; one may slightly overflow while other mug not full . then there instruction book . english fine , but it really make sense instruct user heat up mugs first hot water , then instruct user measure cold water into same mug fill reservoir ? course , user figure his way around , but only way use these mugs would drill extra pinhole each mug lid venting , or just use mug around house , without lid . mug comfortable hold , but thermal value not too good , even when preheated boiling water . i regret made this purchase	-1
greetings , i love this stove top espresso maker but there some differences you may find value . 1)- boiler where you put water only filled 25% compared most 70% which means rather large unit relation amount espresso you make . 2)- maintenance more than others because this machine uses more pressure there more seals replace when necessary . these not readily available locally you probably them shipped you extra expense may exceed your sense reasonableness . also .. most these types machines come extra seals . this unit doesn't come any extra seals all . 3)- picture looking through window top machine seeing nice crema farce . only way see nice crema if you carefully follow directions lift lid up wipe condensation off inside always present blocks your view . 4)- realize this unit made aluminum some concerned toxic effects if any gets into your java high acidity content . plusus include - 1)- very nice tasty espresso superior other stove top machines . ( no aluminum taste)2)- really nice crema but only if yor coffee fine grind #1 , or #2 coffee needs freshly ground . if you buy pre-ground coffee packages market you not seeing any crema . i buy fresh coffee ground half pound #1 , or #2 fine grind get really good results . i hope this helpful you . cheers	-1

le creuset manufactures porcelain enameled cast iron cooking vessels well other products . le creuset casts these cooking vessels molten iron poured sand moulds used only once . this reason , one pot may look like , but each unique its own way . cast iron highly efficient material which absorbs distributes heat efficiently . it recommended cooking cast iron low medium heat . however , there exceptions like boiling water where cooking high heat appropriate okay . remove cast iron heat it not cool off quickly . this heat retention helps your food stay warm while serving . beware ; iron tends heavy so these cooking vessels . cast iron effective material cooking so why cover it enamel ? iron tends rust ; iron oxide ( rust ) doesn't add any complimentary flavors your food . if your cast iron cooking vessel not enameled , you would season maintain your cooking vessel . adding porcelain enamel not only looks good , but multiple benefits . enamel , solid coating , one most hygienic surfaces cook , not stain , absorb odors , retain flavors , easy clean . enamel damaged , so limit cooking tools plastic or wood . benefits cooking le creuset cast iron many , but lets get down buffet casserole specifically . buffet casseroles one most versatile pieces le creuset lineup . use this pan saut� pan , roasting pan , poaching , or shallow braiser . 3.5 quart capacity plenty space when it comes casseroles , so consider your recipes when determining size you need . buffet casserole tends best if least three quarters full . any less you may overwhelm your food evenly dispersed heat pot . large flat bottom curves up this pan resembles curved sided saute pan only thing missing would long handle . tight fitting lid mostly flat curved sides . this lid seals heat , moisture , flavors used hold your meat while you making sauce drippings . its shape design makes this extremely versatile pan . i tend use this pot basic dishes like smothered pork chops more than anything else . but once you get past basic functionality lends itself recipes such paella , frittatas , deep dish pizza , casseroles , you really open up possibilities . keep mind this 3.5 quart pan , feeding two out if it ridiculous unless you want leftovers . it probably perfect size family four most cases . try baking pineapple upside down cake or bread pudding when you need please many guests , poaching fish , or mac cheese . possibilities almost seem endless . one feature people tend complain cost . cost seem steep compared other pans made other materials . heck , cast iron doesn't seem like it should expensive when comparing old cast iron pan past generations used cornbread camping . however manufacturing process requires making mould each every pan produced . they then go through enameling process before shipping these heavy pans . if you take what goes into making distributing these high quality cast iron products , cost tends make sense . then consider this pan easily last lifetime when taken care . pros : extremely versatile efficient absorption distribution heat hygienic enamel cooking surface not stain , absorb odors , or retain flavors easy clean when not abused or misused transferred stove top oven table easily last lifetime cons : its heavy , cast iron tends weighing 12.25 pounds	1

bought this toaster after attempting find decent one local . most everything local big boxes basically junk . thought i would try this toaster based my previous good experience krups brand , not disappointed . toasted everything white pumpernickel , pop tarts , bagels , etc ... heat settings bagel/frozen buttons real good job . handle which also raises toast , something i thought just unecessary extra , actually very handy keeps your fingertips out fire . built well , nice job , recomended	1

i'm one those folks who only sleep " white noise " background . i used use big lasko box fans , but cheap plastic blades those would eventually weaken flap around , making roaring sound . plus poorly designed made screws held grills place would eventually weaken cause grill bang against metal box , making tapping sound all night long would wake dead . i little nervous getting this fan i'd only used huge box fans , this one seemed too efficient quiet make real difference air making " white noise " fall asleep . i actually purchased it bed bath beyond ( not amazon ) $100 , so i'm not sure if there lower price out there somewhere . anyway , i wanted try it home see what i thought , thinking if i didn't like it i could return i t.t he fan incredibly easy put together , you make it two different heights ... short near-the-floor height , or " my bedroom so hot i need fan blowing right me i lay bed " height . low , you barely hear fan , however it moves much air big box fan high . when vornado high , it makes pleasing white-noise sound , really moves air around whole room . it easy adjust point it where you want air go . i point it upper corner my room so air bouces off travels everywhere else ... it really works ! grill extremely easy remove ( no screws all ... just four secure clips ) , fan blade slides right off shaft ( no screw there , either ) . this make it simple clean just under faucet sink or bathtub when it inevitably gets dusty dirty . if you looking whole room circulator or white-noise sleep aid , i couldn't recomment any fan higher ! good quality construction well-engineered thought went into every aspect this product . you won't go wrong	1

i am editing this review clarity . no , i am not talking carbon . this one best brita filter systems i've used . i also use large water cooler model offers hot cold dispensing , i've used several pitcher sizes over years . this large dispenser fits almost anywhere holds far more water than pitcher sizes . valve works perfectly closes securely . so , if capacity more important than portability , this great dispenser . because valve , kids use this much easier than they might full , large pitcher . my only problem it mould-like stuff grows mine . no , that not carbon all us brita users used ignoring . it fuzzy stuff grows clumps sticks plastic very hard remove . maybe that because large upper reservoir remains damp closed longer than smaller pitcher system would because it upstairs where my air conditioning doesn't reach . it hot up there most year . because relatively small , but convenient , filler opening , it not easy see into reservoir through it . so , it easier just keep filling without looking into it until filler time . i going discard this , but after realizing nobody household got sick , i decided keep it . i'm leaving one-star rating place because i can't edit it , because i'm tired household members who complain growths . hey , that what faucet . what they think grows there ?	-1

these bit expensive , but turned out fantastic - compact , sturdy not too much eye sore . they hold quite bit so you're not refill them too often keeps food fresh . lids little tricky close . because they angle , they tend not line up w/the grids well , but i don't consider necessarily manufacturing flaw ; perhaps design flaw , but angle makes getting food out easier . i'd buy them again	1

my review male perspective , two weeks ago i not know duvet existed now i know you better get right size . comforter esthetically very nice fluffed up well . i bought one j.c. penny higher cost less fill it ugly , i purchase it because my dog eat my other comforter . i returned it j.c. penny . what it worth after looking these comforters few weeks getting one or two i not happy , this one all i expected . it looks good , fluffed up well fifteen year warranty if you it duvet . my dog not seem like it taste but it hard get him off it , he loves it , important factor me . update : we now some somewhat cool nights texas 30 i am warm toast . well worth price ! if you get some tarp clips sew them into duvet you clip comforter into duvet it works great keeping it where you want it , just observation . i would not hesitate purchase " royal velvet " quality appearance worth price . i keep door closed keep my doberman off if he access other rooms just lot class . he likes quality softness , not mention warmth . go figure . people 1 , doberman 2 . not mention i lowered heat night so comforter cost wise free since i am warm or warmer than before , not bad investment .	1

i asked popcorn popper christmas , got this . i wanted air popper , but maybe i wasn't specific when i asked . anyway , cuisinart product , i thought it must good . also , my cousin oil popper ( different brand ) makes great popcorn , so i thought i'd try it . steam collects lid/bowl making wet popcorn . some popcorn burnt , even spinner device , because popcorn stayed heat plate too long after it popped - it can't all top pile . i still tried eat finished popcorn ( unburnt , less wet pieces ) it terrible texture sort too hard - stale maybe - but it fresh corn . plus , even lots butter salt , it sort strange taste - sort chemically maybe ? manual even said something chemicals needing burn off during first few uses ( i even washed it before i used it because possibility ) . lastly , even though it non-stick , it difficult clean cooked oil off heat plate . this worst product ever so many reasons : flawed design , lack ease cleaning , overall performace , terrible end product ! i ended up feeding popcorn my dog - least she seemed like it . i am seriously shocked poor quality this item . i cannot believe cuisinart let it market . how earth it pass their test kitchens ? i wanted popcorn maker so badly now i am stuck piece junk . compared batch popcorn , i'd rather eat raw kernals straight out bag	-1

nutshell : gold standard price tin openers go - there none better , but fact these available around $10 . last literally forever seems too good true . nevertheless , it true . like many other people , we tried lot different openers , some electric some hand held , but we always come back one always our kitchen -- ' swing-a-way ' . what makes ' swing-a-way opener ' superior other openers ? 3 components contribute synergistically swing-a-way success ; 1]- very durable tempered steel gears cutting edge stays sharp literally forever . 2]- ample leverage provided large chrome-plated steel turn-key assure enough torque into gears open any simply hand turning . 3]- plastic coated steel handles facilitate penetration cutting edges just ordinary hand pressure . why these long lasting super openers so inexpensive ? only several moving parts made easily manufactured components sold huge scale worldwide , it costs very little make this product despite its excellence .

pros : easy use , solid , makes good espressocons : noisy , single insert too smalli bought machine 2 months ago i'm very happy it . i don't use steamer so i can't tell you anything it . i use machine every day make espresso i'm drinking one right now . machine solid well built . it makes very good espresso although i use larger insert double espresso make single shot ( single insert too small me ) . i always get nice rich crema although results vary based brand coffee i use . some reviewers mention coffee comes out cold . i never coffee not warm enough . mine comes out always right temperature ( i use plastic cups usually i wait minute before drinking so i don't burn my tongue ) . make sure you wait orange light go out so right temperature reached . yes , machine somewhat noisy when it operates but i guess that inevitable . making shot takes minute or two subsequent ones made even faster . overall this great product . i use it every day i recommend xp4000	1

this my first waffle maker , so i can't really give good review , but i guess i'm pretty happy it . it beeps ( you kind get used siren-like beeps :)) when pan warmed up it beeps again when waffle . it makes good waffles , but my only complaint it hard spread batter whole entire pan , since batter rises you cook it . my first try i batter overflowing out pan ( pain clean ) , other times i didn't put enough batter ; it takes some practice . i guess if you buy rotating ones batter spread more evenly , but those too expensive my budget . overall i think it good deal money	-1

i read all reviews all dyson models before i decided buying dc 17 model . i 3 dogs i'm always fighting dog hair . much i love my canine buddies , i hate their constant shedding . those who say lab don't shed liars !! i just got my dyson today , like child christmas morning i could not get it out box fast enough . i wish instructions better laid out instead picture form-i like descriptions go pictures . but after while trial error i figured it out . i central canister vacuum system runs through house ( i've hated it beginning ) because my husband thinks that way go . canister out garage he thinks it healthier him not dust house when vacuum emptied . 25 ' hose you drag room room always gets way , i never thought it cleaned well 1st place . it always sore spot . so i decided put it ultimate test . i vacuumed my rugs carpet old relic then came behind dyson . man , [ ... ] came out my so-called " just vacuumed " rugs beyond belief !!! i expected get lot junk , but still amazed how much it actually picked up !!! what everyone else said before me true !!!! fact it hepa filter you clean every 6 months , it appears pretty easy clean pictured instructions , i take bin outside dump it out if he freaks out thinking dust run rampant house when it time empty it . i wanted dyson quite while . i've herd nothing but good things them reviews i read dc 17 model made me finally decide take plunge . i'm sure glad i . i now feel secure knowing when i vacuum floors now they actually clean when i'm !! dyson extended their warrenty 5 years-what other company their vacuum cleaners ? i recommend dyson everyone anyone who listen ! thank you dyson making such outstanding amazing product !!	1

i just received sharpener today henckels santoku . i sharpened half dozen old henckels home found sharpening process very quick . last time i sharpened knives whetstone this process definitely much faster . i get knives sharp manual process . i hoping ' razor ' sharp edge comes brand new knives , but it seems may not achievalble tool . i used new knife benchmark , it not possible me get same degree sharpness . machine provide edges , though , definitely usable , probably better than average person achieve whetstone . much faster . i first followed instructions came sharpener , it quite hard grasp . it asks user hold knife lightly let magnet align knife . what worked me look directly over machine so i see contact knife edge moving abrasive . looking angle trying keep angle consistent , working magnet becomes quite intuitive . trying keep angle constant , hand subconsciously lets magnet align knife . if you pull knife blindly , this process doesn't work quite well ... least beginning , i suppose , since i just started use product . overall i am happy sharpener , would use this over manual sharpening any day . if i sushi chef who whose life depended sharp edge , i would probably not use it , but keep set knives reasonable condition everyday cooking , machine definitely more than adequate	-1

spend extra buy cuisinart . i bought hamilton big mouth november , just time use all extra cooking i through holidays . i didn't money spend cuisinart time , so i thought i'd give hamilton beach try , after looking reviews here . now , this my first time using hamilton beach food processor , i've worked professional kitchens always used cuisinarts , i'm used them work horses plow through any kind food you process . first , things going great -- it survived through thanksgiving 20 , christmas 30 , last thing made large batch gingerbread dough . i put machine away , just brought it out use weekend worth cooking , it dead . we've troubleshooted through everything , but no avail . i guess this product would fine if you only cooked occasionally , but frequent home cook who occasionally also large meals , i'd seriously suggest getting better more sturdy brand .	-1

ff x5 great , well built , makes good espresso good froth . however , ff exclusive service center sucks . it better buy appliance fixed locally . i sen't my x5 because it started trip my circuit breaker . their customer service sucks . after few weeks , i called see what diagnosis , first thing they said they didn't receive unit yet but doesn't mean it not their warehouse yet , sometimes warehouse not report them if machine arrived yet until they time process it . after 2 weeks , i called they said they trying call me but my phone not voice mail . i told them over over call me my office number , but they kept calling my home phone number which i don't answering machine . they my home number because number matches my credit card time original purchase . estimate $205.78 i asked them itemize it me , i called them twice this . they never mentioned part this charge $73.73 ups shipping ( it only $46.40 according ups ) . i approved estimate , machine arrived yesterday ... damaged . francis francis didn't want hear my complain , they just told me deal ups claims . ups pick up machine tomorrow inspection . ff declared value only $300 , go figure ? one more thing , i sent it ff original box , they returned it me box ( some sort warehouse box they use ff machines ) . i strong believe original box better , it heavy styrofoam inserts fitted protect machine shipping damage itself . styrofoam inserts original box supports heavy top x5 . x5 , shipped non-original box arrived collapsed top smashing base , disfiguring base 1 inch , it awefull see this heavy metal baby all sad like this . i think this common problem because part packing material non-original box thick cardboard insert says very descriptivelly this piece cardboard needs bee top base otherwise they won't responsible shipping damage . cardboard there , but it obvious me fitted styrofoam better . conclusion , this machine require periodic maintenance repaired factory , however if factory sucks , get brand instead . unless you willing buy new unit every time yours fail , don't get this machine	-1

this early christmas present my loving wife , i weigh dry ingredients our weekly batch belgian waffles , then perfectly time baking built-in repeatable timer . test scale accuracy , i set 2-cup measuring cup platform before switching it so it would zero out weight cup . i then slowly poured water into cup until display read 8 ounces ( every fan " good eats " food network knows " pint pound whole world ' round , " thus , cup liquid weighs 8 ounces ) . water just kissed 8 ounce marking measuring cup . that more accuracy than anyone needs kitchen . tare button lets you zero out scale after each ingredient so you don't add up total weigh t.t he platform looks small but handle 10 inch dinner plate without obscuring display . like my prized waring pro belgian waffle maker ( also christmas gift my darling cathy ) , scale handsome enough leave display all time	1

ceramic cooktop owner who loves cast iron , i invest some enameled cast iron . ( unenameled cast iron may scratch surface . ) i chose le creuset . i enjoy cooking all le creuset skillets pots i own . i noticed some comments here compelled me write this review . black seen pan not teflon , but black cast iron . cast iron skillets come either seasoned or unseasoned . i ones stick worse than others . i can't explain it , but if surface looks dull gray opposed shiny black , it probably needs some grease added it . i usually just spray cooking oil prior cooking easier cleanup . i'm just guessing . directions may found lodge cast iron website . lodge now offers enameled cast iron line nordic ware , but le creuset seems sale more often offered more places . also avoid cracking porcelain enamel , follow manufacturer instructions allowing pan cook down room temperature . extreme temperature changes may crack glaze . i say these really heavy pans i strategize which shelves they go .	1
tri-ply cookware necessity if you own gas stove . thick bottoms thin sides ( " simply calphalon " line , example ) work fine electric stove , but gas stove heat sides enough scorch your food circle above base , sometimes all way up lid . fully-clad tri-ply cookware heats evenly rim rim , so you not get scorching gas stove . ( personally , i think they cook better electric stoves , too . ) calphalon copper cookware enough copper make noticeable difference how evenly pan heats . pan thickness overall 2.8 mm , outside copper layer 0.8 mm -- respectable thickness . others may claim this copper outer layer " doesn't really " matter , but it * * matter . pans made copper tri-ply simply heat faster more evenly than equivalent pan stainless tri-ply . however , well-made stainless tri-ply pans very , very good , nothing scoff . ( ease cleanup stainless nice , too . ) calphalon tri-ply pans same performance league all-clad . i've used both , thickness overall , balance , design , handle lids calphalon pans excellent , fully all-clad level quality . check out price difference yourself . these pans designed more experienced cooks . you need know how preheat pan proper cooking , but when used good technique , stainless-lined saut� pan stick very little -- most cases , when you saut� , you want least * little * sticking , so you get some caramelized fond your food deglazing sauce reductions . soups , sauces more liquid-based cooking , stainless lining works like charm . this particular pan good size many cooking needs -- big enough cook up four people , but not unwieldy . it deep enough add whole bottle wine braising ( room spare ) but shallow enough use spatula without contortions . rounded corners deglazed whisk . all all , entire calphalon tri-ply line exhibits intelligent , traditional design , thoroughly modern " stay-cool " handles ( very comfortable well-balanced ) flared pouring rims . if you torn copper tri-ply pan very expensive stainless-lined solid copper 2.5 mm pan ( like mauviel , bourgeat or falk ) here quick way help you decide : go upscale kitchen store handle one those fancy french solid copper pans . they weigh ton -- they're least twice heavy tri-ply . they cost least twice much . ( they give you great bragging rights , though ... ) always , watch sales , also bogus mark-up/mark-down pricing ( very common here . ) calphalon company website clearly shows legitimate suggested retail price .	1
my husband i just purchased ceramic top stove . after finding out we could no longer use our old , much loved , revere copper-bottomed pots pans new stove , we began look new cookware . so much what out there terribly expensive i don't like stainless steel handles -- they too long store stuff easily pots pans too heavy . addition , " sets " cookware available left too much out - not enough sauce pans -- too many fry pans . thankfully , we found this 14-piece revere 2000 set here amazon . it absolutely eveything i want cookware set . i like " pistol grip " stay cool handles round lid knobs . everything set easy store ( nice , short handles ! ) , easy use stove top , easy clean . cookware heats up quickly efficiently - i able boil water short time medium heat - never turn stove knob " high " . food stays good hot stove lids stove turned off . i no problem cleaning anything - i just put drop dish detergent warm water let pan soak short while . using " tuffy " plastic scrub pad little bit " barkeepers friend " sponge keeps this cookware looking new . i am very pleased this set plan purchase more accessories this line . set practical , highly useable easy store . plus , it didn't cost fortune ! i'm delighted !	1

i bought this set petsmart $50 my long-haired rottweiler . let get one thing straight here - my rottweiler thick hair , 3 inches long , she completely covered dirt all time . these clippers cut through her hair ( i didn't give her bath , so they cut through her dusty fir ) no problems all ! i got 4 good uses out these , then blades finally went dull . i searched andis website which extremely helpful , they show you list blades fit your clippers you buy them or find store sells what you need . replacement blades $16 horse/dog type ... i admit , i contemplated buying sheep clippers my dog one time . motor runs same when i first bought it regardless all dirt hair gone through it . i say even spending $50 these clippers good deal , since taking dog get groomed $40 or more each time ! kit comes ton clipping guides all sizes , sheers , clipper lubricant , brush . it also comes video which i never watched , so i can't say if it would helpful or not . i definitely recommend this any size dog	1

i also own both salt ball pepper ball disagree previous reviewer ; i find both useful table but very unhelpful when cooking . balls both great when seasoning food , but not work all recipes require exact amounts . opening bottom ball extremely large , attempting direct what coming out into teaspoon or tablespoon worthless- you'll use up all pepper before you get whatever measurement you need . additionally , mine ( ordered amazon.com ) not come stand product claims . therefore , when ball sitting counter , it very susceptible picking up things around it- any sort spilt liquid go up into ball ( especially salt one ) ruin whatever inside . i also agree both balls produce very inconsistent salt pepper- even whole pepper balls come through mine . also , amount pepper inside beginning very limited ( mine only 1/4 full when i got it ) . however , if you able keep them dry don't mind refills , these balls give you freshly ground salt pepper , easy use , make cute addition table . i believe both overpriced what they , you wind up paying $30 set . you might want consider either paying extra $10 more durable effective set or sticking cheaper , non-mill varieties .	-1

we not fence , so petsafe wireless fence unit significantly improved quality life dog us . we adjusted base unit allow forest creatures escape . we weren't able put invisible fence where we planned because chain-link enclosure ( dog " sand box " ) beside our driveway interfered signal . collar uses up specialized batteries quickly , so keep supply hand . check collar daily before using . when battery replaced , collar must reset appropriate shock level . we left boundary flags up 10 days although dog figured it out first day . my dog only experienced one shock ( setting four ) first day ; since then , beep enough keep him within boundaries . petsafe retains control over selling price its products , so there no bargain basement prices any vendor .	1

i almost didn't buy this machine because i worried some negative reveiws i've read it users . however , it only machine its price range really caught our eye , so we went ahead purchased it using it six months . it hands down best machine i've ever owned . it great features , espresso best espresso i've made home , better than most espresso i buy american coffee shops . quick rundown great features . 1 . it looks great . it heats up quickly , it very simple use . 2 . size water resevoir pretty generous . it holds enough water 24 shots . you expect get little less if you steaming lot milk , but if you steaming recommended temperature , machine very water efficient , you shouldn't see dramatic drop . we use it every day make least two drinks ( leeast 4 shots ) , lot more weekends , we refill only once week , roughly . design also makes it quite easy refill , i've middle steaming or pulling shot when i realized reservoir low , refilled whiled pulling shot . this awfully convenient . 3 . machine comes disc you put inside porta filter make sort fake crema whipping coffee , which popular upper-end machines these days . however , if you using good coffee , grind your beans fresh , brew coffee recommended temperature , machine produces wonderful genuine crema without disc . i never get espresso coffee house crema good . ( crema more quality coffee than machine , but cheaper machines pull coffee way too hot never produce good cremas because crazy temperatures . ) 4 . steam wand great job genlty steaming frothing without scalding daylights out your milk . i've heard lot complaints steamer , but my experience it works perfectly , easily . 5 . it come adaption pods , if you're into pods ( blech . ) 6 , i love machine temperature gague allows you control temperature your steam coffee , not just indicator lights . it allows you lot more control over quality your espresso . few things so so , included tamp flimsy useless , get yourself nice heavy one . drip tray feel little light cheap compared rest machine , but it perfectly functional . cup warmer isn't very successful warming cups . but these minor quibbles i it . i'm sure if i willing pay 4 or 5 times much , i'd get better espresso , but price , i couldn't happier this machine . it beats any little starter machines you get , makes better espresso than machines cost twice price , my experience . i'm very happy this machine .	-1

passionate home cook honing her cooking skills last 25 years writes this review . my favorite cookbooks " professional chef " culinary institute " culinary artistry " . i love cook i prepare three meals day most days month . my husband i embarked mostly vegan lifestyle 3 months ago i decided i needed larger salad spinner . i purchased this salad spinner replace smaller one battery operated i using least 15 years . pros : 1 . rubber bottom this spinner keeps it place counter while you using it . this big improvement over standard spinners . 2 . large capacity also very nice if you eat lot vegetation . 3 . pump easy use provided you remember not push all way bottom stroke causes it lock . this takes little getting used , but you get hang it eventually . 4 . pump mechanism should less susceptible breakage than string models . i heard others pull mechanism prone breakage pull models . 5 . it removes much water produce my battery operated salad spinner . cons : 1 . i can't remove center stem basket no matter what i try . i think this design flaw . 2 . spinner little awkward clean center stem place . overall , i think this product middle road , not great but not terrible either . i like extra capacity , but i would much happier if i could get stem out basket facilitate cleaning thing .	-1

i first started seeing this pan giada de laurentis ' cooking show " everyday italian " when i began collecting le creuset . i didn't know it casserole time since it more resembles " everyday pans " sold manufactuers like calphalon all-clad . course , you use it casserole it perfect size macaroni cheese , fruit cobbler , or chicken dumplings . however , it also great saute fry pan : steaks chops brown beautifully ; it great making quick pasta sauce ; it fries chicken like champ ; risotto cooks slowly evenly ; it even big enough small medium roast . fact , i like it so much i got five quart model big batches paella larger roasts like turkeys hams . not only this pan joy use look , it also easy care . it go dishwasher , but really all it needs little soak caked food just comes off scrubby sponge or dish brush . though any cook would appreciate this piece , it especially good starter piece recent graduate or newlywed it last lifetime .	1

i bought this particular filter faucet mount couple reasons . first , i something called chlordane my water ( insecticide ) i wanted it out . secondly , my water very strong chlorine smell it . i looked into getting filter scrubs chlorine , maybe i eventually , but now this particular filter works fine . i bought mount because it just happened sale when i went store buy it . i read lot bad stuff vertical filters how they consistently leaked after few months , but hadn't seen anything like their horizontal mounts . i little disappointed first when i installed my filter because it indeed leak . fortunately , it doesn't leak filter housing , but rather where filter connected tap . eventually , problem went away , though not before spraying water all over my kitchen . i also not happy prospect run my water five minutes clean out filter , but i lived it . really , i may sound negative , but i'm actually quite happy i bought filter . my water tastes better ( though still heavy ) smells better . i feel better now i've removed chemicals what i'm drinking , i well pleased filter . water flow fine , though i've heard it tends slow down it gets older . display let you know when filter needs replacing opposed just guessing nice . it good little filter unless you're looking scrub chlorine your water ( it only removes taste odor ) worth consideration if you just want water tastes better	-1
