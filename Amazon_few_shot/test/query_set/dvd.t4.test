population hong kong approximately 7 million people . i'd say half them get shot this movie . usually when movie runs over 2 hours , it because there lot plot director wanted squeeze . case hard boiled , running time 126 minutes clearly necessitated john woo desire get into guinness book records " most people killed gunfire single motion picture . " chow yun-fat charismatic actor who bring wonderful balletic grace gunplay , this movie gives him plenty opportunity show his stuff . he shoots ( usually pistol each hand ) while diving headlong over furniture , while swinging rope , while sliding down banister (!) , while hurled through air explosions . sometimes he even shoots while standing still . he shoots , shoots , shoots . bad guys shoot , shoot , shoot . yun-fat fellow cops shoot , shoot , -- you get idea . there some fine action scenes this film , but my eyes glazing over long before it ended . there wasn't enough distinguish one scene bunch people machine-gunned next , it became painfully repetitious . personally i would highly recommend replacement killers over hard boiled . there plenty yun-fat balletic shoot-em-up action , but not so much you find yourself odd position lulled sleep gunfire	-1

i saw this movie i found it both shocking choking . it displays children young 4 years old smoking cigarettes ! filmmakers take into account damage tobacco could these child stars ? ( yes , cigarettes smoke real , not cg . ) i think they should omitted such scenes script , because it displays behavior that not only illegal several countries , but also threatening both society childhood . no matter what other reviewers thought movie , i give it disgusting 1 , this last movie i ever watch depicts smoking children . those haven't yet watched this movie , please don't watch it , unless you want cancer win health wars . here i hand out lesson every active or aspiring moviemaker : if you want depict smoking children , use computer graphics instead real thing	-1

fan zombie movies someone who enjoyed city living dead zombie , i very disappointed house cemetery . fulci manages create good mystery first two-thirds movie , only squander it some poorly executed scare scenes . house cemetery researcher ( whose work never specified ) who moves his wife his kid into house massachussets order finish out work colleague who killed himself his mistress . titular house only place they really find moment , so dr. boyle , his wife lucy their son bob move despite lot bad signs , like boarded-up door cellar tombstone dr. jacob tess freudstein front hall . bob little red-headed girl friend who keeps warning him how bad house ( though no one else sees her ) . furthermore , people keep claiming dr. boyle town before non-existent daughter ( which he denies , not totally convincingly ) . he also seems some secret relationship babysitter , anne , who starts unboarding cellar door middle night . lucy seems either recovering or suffering serious psychological issues . got ? good , because half stuff never gets explained . only things get worked out little red-headed girl identity identity killer ( neither which hard figure out ) . there some nice visual moments earlier parts film ( fact killer one normal hand one rotting hand , photograph changes each viewing , mannequin gets beheaded starts bleeding ) but fulci ability handle gore moments disappoints . he lingers too long over some deaths , makes killer so ridiculously slow snail could outrun him bits like babysitter head falling down stairs come off funny rather than scary . compared injury eye scene zombie or christopher george chopping through coffin cotld , dr. boyle chopping through door around his son head feels like self-parody . fulci other films incoherent plots , but rarely way seems work against plot ( dream-like nature city living dead seems appropriate given prophetic dream heroine gets mystical nature threat ) execution setpieces usually fantastic . house cemetery neither thing working its favor . it not hell living dead-level bad , but fact it some genuinely good acting ( especially paolo malco , who plays dr. boyle ) interesting set-up almost make flaws worse . also , this version " never before seen deleted scene " , but it no sound just extended reaction shot after bat attack	-1

" above rim " entertaining street drama focuses around kyle lee watson , inner-city high school basketball player who shows lot promise but lets his own arrogance get best him . he won't listen anybody who offers him advice how improve his game , he thinks he best player ever . he hoping his mad skills catching college scout attention , but he catch birdie eyes when he plays . birdie well known gang leader who offers kyle good life so long he plays his neighborhood team " shoot-out " basketball contest means world him . kyle -- impatient ever -- agrees join , not seeing clear danger front him . high school security guard past knows danger birdie presents , he only who chance get through kyle before it too late . not only this very good basketball movie , but it also intense character-driven drama centered around choices we make life ... how we live them long run . film some great performances duane martin , marlon wayans late tupac shakur . even though everybody great their roles , showstopper indeed shakur . he gives very masterful performance really sticks out stay you long after movie over . my only complaint length movie . it true movie runs little over hour half isn't short , but i think story characters open more possibilities add movie . i think more opportunities risks could taken further enrich story . still , it really good movie didn't disappoint me . dvd doesn't whole lot offer . you either watch movie widescreen or fullscreen , depending your preference . movie looks sounds very good . only special features offered movie trailers , those aren't even great . i would've loved it if they included music video , " regulate " warren nate dogg . fact , given some great rap songs this movie , they could've included couple music videos . it not great dvd , but least it not expensive . i really enjoyed " above rim . " it may not flawless , but it definitely more right than wrong . characters what really dominate movie . even if you're not fan game , it still something check out if you're fan character drama . exciting , intense , conflict-driven full heart , " above rim " very well film . -michael cran	1
i remember watching this high school . i thought it great fun then my kids think it still now . okay , we're not talking academy award material here ( emmy ? ) . ralph , bill , pam back third final season this far too short series man who given suit aliens gives him super powers . he teamed fbi agent help world survive itself . first few minutes ralph looses instruction book must noodle out how operate suit . he runs into few walls , literally . first season little rough . second season fleshed out concept . this third season started stretch its legs but show cancelled . i looked years novels based show , no avail . i even contacted cannell ask if i could write them . disney half-heartedly working feature film based show cannell wouldn't cut loose permission . alas , it would've fun . anyway , if you other two seasons you'll love this one . only complaint/change i would make play theme song before each episode . i would've made it so you could hit " forward next " button go right action . also , jacket plays bit theme song . i wish they'd made it possible change batteries . mike hudspeth st. louis , missour	1

scratching deeper beyond surface one find return seven significantly different its predecessor , magnificent seven . it much more than thematically framed sequel which it easily mistaken . return seven dark film it not offer hope truly optimistic future any its characters . this respect it complete inversion magnificent seven . through their catharsis original we saw attempt redemption through act nobility part seven . they truly noble i believe redeemed their transgressions gunmen . some thought they could start their lives over again but inevitably they could not . film end it seven ultimately all committed their singular code ethics morality emotionally charged finale . this film there very little emotion surface . instead director burt kennedy gives us thought provoking study into human psyche very nature defeatism human spirit . this film there no pretensions part seven . most them this just gun job . there no higher aspirations they cognizant . if it not this job , it would next . tell his story burt kennedy focuses almost entirely character chris leader , perfectly portrayed again yul brynner . this not really tale seven . instead kennedy uses brynner all his aplomb apparent stoicism curiously examine probe motivations other six , lorca villain ( pompously played mexican director emilio fernandez ) several other key characters . effect kennedy takes what apparently happy or satisfactory ending magnificent seven asks what if . what if 10 years later remaining characters not so contented prior events led us believe they would ? would friends willing go up against innumerable odds ? would strangers once again sign go up against those same innumerable odds ? strong still help weak ? who really strong weak ? when 50 or more marauding vaqueros whisk away chico ( julian mateos ) other mexican farmers surrounding villages chris vin ( robert fuller ) agree come his aid . however it chris alone recruits members " seven " this time out . kennedy singularly endows chris sense morality level headedness this film comes his wisdom manner nobility . effect this brynner film all way . just john sturges ' directorial style so smooth his own storytelling glossed right over depth complexity his own work so burt kennedy . however , kennedy challenged very dark brooding tale tell . where sturges ' magnificent seven could easily taken purely action film level still successful , kennedy not luxury . kennedy deliver action film built previous events he also approach story different perspective remain fresh yet keep it thematically concept original " seven . " not easy task ! if viewer not look deeply into this film it may just appear well produced `dud . ' however , i believe kennedy succeeds far beyond expectations more times i view this film . again it comes back brynner . he makes members seven ( vin , chico colbee ) all come realizations themselves his subtle yet profound dialogue . he gives riker luis chance redemption even though both men come total opposites spectrum . he helps failed priest rise his failures " least far his knees . " chris even gives lorca , villain chance ride out because when chris younger he gave him same chance . however , chris refuses let lorca now bathe his personal grief ineffectual father " other men blood . " yet even lorca literally redeemed end film . when petra tells chris farmers never forget them he simply replies , " that all man ask . " mystique legacy " seven . " even character chris endowed human flaws . he recklessly took young manuel rounding out seven " luck " tragic results we see brynner deeply grieved screen . this film hard lessons learned . technically this well-made film . cinematography full crane , dolly tracking shots , which gives it both perspective movement . bernstein score full lush this single cohesive element keeps seven together . set designs dark , grim rustic giving film pensive psychological depth . payoff brynner viewer comes final shot . looking farmers rebuilding village he comments , " i'll damned . " vin looks him responds , " i doubt . i doubt very much . " they both ride off . they just don't make heroes like any more	1

a-team-the complete third season now available dvd . dual sided dvd box set includes all 25 episodes shows 1984-1985 season . a-team very popular series during 80 . co-star mr. owes much his 1980 success a-team . mr. , b.a. , didn't really much screen time hannibal ( george peppard ) or characters face murdock , but he easily most recognizable member cast . season 3 , similar previous seasons filled with-action , adventure , exotic locals , disguises , interesting situations . season begins episode " bullets bikinis " ( airdate 9/18/84 ) . when mob attempts take over hotel a-team rescue her hotel . strange twist , two part episode " bend river " falls into slot second third episodes season . usually when series two part episode early season episode used season premiere . well , " bend river " actually slow episode which may explain why it not used season premiere . this episode archeologist traveling amazon region looking secrets but he finds conflict local pirates bad guy named el cahon . soon hannibal seen movie set dressed up monster costume aquamaniac . after he fired , face tries convince producer keep him . no film work keeping them occupied , they decide help tanya ( archeologists girlfriend ) find her missing archeologist boyfriend . season three , a-team begun lose little it magic fan base . compared miami vice , a-team seemed little quirky corny times . despite this , it still great show fans show should add season three their collection because there some good episodes during season . season three special guests include markie post ( nightcourt ) , dennis franz ( nypd blue ) , kristen meadows .	1
i heard lot hoopla dan brown fictional novel . most it trash ; people claim brown opened pandora box christianity , when , reality , he nothing more than sway fickle , while reinforcing beliefs those who thorough research . interestingly , history channel documentary brown fictional novel quite enlightening . read material those involved jesus seminar , i feel they nothing more than bunch left-wing quacks . yet , people took part , gained fame , jesus seminar quite genius . here group people successfully made millions dollars because speculation . fact , sir arthur conan doyle agatha christie , together , could not written better speculative fiction . course , documentary shines lot light this otherwise dark bit pseudo-history . first , documentary discusses various " possibilities " historical jesus . they take several books brown cited list , which located back his book , explore possibility their true . each book brown cited , sticks , nothing more than fickle assumptions based upon skewed views beliefs . while i am not against speculation , because hypotheses push research discovery , i am against presenting something truth when there no real evidence . even one authors holy blood , holy grail makes appearance history channel doc . what he say his own novel ? he basically says his books not prove anything ; all he attempting convey possibility there could jesus royal blood line . sum up documentary : history channel excellent job exposing pure speculation dan brown , all others involved accusing christians not seeing " true " historical jesus . while there some questions historians still need answer , anything ancient , jesus still stands test time , firmly . i surprised history channel position repute claims dan brown , jesus seminar , but they , very well , too . take time sit watch this great documentary if you unsure , skeptical , or scared what dan brown novel say christianity . you not let down .	1

this excellent film . billy bob clean-vut barber who keeps himself . his wife married him because she liked he didn't talk very much . it tragedy epic proportions , great performances all involved . only thing me holds this back five star film fact every single scene someone lights up cigarette or taking deep drags one . alone justifies this film " " rating . when watching this film , it seems they encouraging people " cool " smoking pleasurable thing . most notorious moment me when frances mcdormand sitting bathtub asks her barber husband ( billy bob ) shave her legs . he walks somberly cigarette drooping his lips she tells him give her drag . this putrid moment just drove me crazy ! but then , just my opinion . overall , film could good greater if it not incessant smoking throughout . plot slow yet intensely emotional . if you don't mind smoking , then you probably enjoy this dramatic tragedy . if you strongly opposed smoking or children who interested seeing this , you should review film before letting them see it	1

this horrendous movie . i never claim it movie my generation . it one many reasons why i absolutely hate " 80 " . others : breakdancing , yuppie lifestyle , power hungry businessmen/women , women manly handshakes , new wave music , junk movies like this . i know main character nothing less than manipulator who only concerned himself , what he get out life . he ridicules his friend because he sick , doesn't feel like driving ferris around ... especially ferrari mysteriously gets lost parking garage , so what am i left believe i wonder if this where ice cube got inspiration " it good day " . i don't care what decade it , or what cool back then , or now manipulating your friends " not " i repeat " not " cool . i know john johnette . public this something sexual relase . i could picture private parts men women everywhere getting soaking wet this movie , i find it so repulsive everyone out there finds this funny .	-1
i similar situation this show [ catholic envirement ] seen both this show ' men boys town ' . this reason i got these show [ both one dvd ] . it good deal money . one funniest parts when mo made whitey look like al jolson how everyone laughed him during row call . gene reynolds played tony ponessa [ also starred ' they shall music ' ] perfect part . unlike ted martley [ men boys town ] who cried attention tony preferred thing himself not depend others anything . some ways he ted martley alike . these shows sure takes me back those days when i raised catholic orphanage where i saw both these shows .	1
buy this movie . read book . movie very beautiful i personally love watch it regular basis , but script takes huge liberties history . although this really masterful film making many respects , actual story book more interesting , more complex , we get find out what happened these actual people after their seabiscuit collaberation ended . whole tale one worth knowing . unlike jeff bridges character , seabiscuits ' owner acomplished horseman who attended military school served cavalry . didn't see movie ... most movies based history leave out awful lot . none us sit through six hour show . so just remember you never get accuracy hollywood , you get great show . there difference . gone wind same injustice it ; movie romantic pastiche while book astonishingly different . might wanna read one too . if you ever rode or spent any time track you'll need fix this movie periodicly just see magnificent racing scenes , so just keep it shelf . get letterbox one ... just georgeous !	1

utterly fascinating look crash burn american family . father , arnie friedman , witness his mother inappropriate self-serving sexual activity ; unsurprisingly , he turns out pedophile whose penchant buying kiddie mags gets him investigaged child rape . his wife , elaine , who looks like years arnie sucked life out her , walks around fog , totally bewildered a)she married such creepy little freak b)her three boys prefers dad her . oldest son dave his own state denial his father problems blames it all mom . most sympathetic figure youngest boy jesse , who imprisoned 13 years most unsympathetic crime . arnie jesse rape those little boys ? interviewed accuser comes across less than credible - he contradicts himself , can't remember first episode molestation ( though remembers plenty else ) when asked explain important detail , hesitates though he thinking " what heck i say now ? " feds appear caught up same hysteria got bunch innocent day care providers tossed prison 1980s - they used interview techniques more like criminal interrogations hypnosis ( reknown inducing false memories . ) way manipulate damage little kids , you dumb cops . any case , arnie self-admitted pedophile his taste child porn victimizes his whole family , especially jesse ( possibly more ways than one . ) despite this , his boys absolutely adore him . it hard understand why - their home movies , dad comes across emotional dud , flat affect distant stare . most animated he gets when he pounds out " i'm heaven " piano night before he goes prison . oldest son david especially apologist arnie . he implies if elaine not such cold fish arnie wouldn't predicament he ended up . you just want slap dave around facts life : " david ! wake up ! your parents didn't sex because daddy likes little boys !

after looking some reviews , i'll admit i'm bit confused . i think this made after gettysburg so any motivation remorse couldn't much " andersonville " .... younger civil war/war northern aggression student , i read mackinlay kantor book " andersonville " while there much vile see this film , it show why written word still most powerful weapon war . kantor descriptions writing defy depiction even most skilled set-dresser . nobody , i mean nobody , federal or confederate , officer or enlisted man , young or old come out situation such andersonville looking particularly well -- post-liberation photographs show it , just post-liberation photographs auschwitz , dachau , bergen-belsen . german film 1950s " doctor stalingrad " which purported show conditions german pow camp soviet union after world war ii , great film " hart war " depict relative shangri-la conditions ... someone who knows little pow situation during this great american conflict , i would recommend dvd " andersonville " but not isolation . it must tempered rounded knowledge conditions northern camps -- which appear history channel regularly ... recognition after prisoner exchange discontinued , nothing short genocide fairly grand scale could result . i recall television documentary trial andersonville commander , whic starred all people william shatner -- back 1970s or so ... which i quite impressed should resurrected . but present , films such " andersonville " replete underlying messages horrors war , humans make war then complain conditions which inevitable , despite our intelligence we not found alternative it -- yet . if this film inspires one intellect put his or her head solution this problem , then there no more andersonvilles .... this film shows how easily humans who civilized ( we think ) descend into psychosocial dynamics crowd , group , herd , plundering devaluing human life mere livestock	1

before i saw this fantastic animated masterpiece , my only contact japanese anime ' when my nieces nephews came visits ( they interested watching ninja/karate/sailor moon , etc ) . these cartoons , although hypnotic mesmerizing kids , seemed mindless no real message ( not there anything wrong ) . one evening this past january , i flipping through channels when i came upon tcm thursday night special tribute hayao miyazaki . i listened pre-feature info-guy describing great artistry storytelling this director thought " i'll give it 2 minutes then continue flipping " . after only ten minutes i found myself totally immersed experience . what beautifully crafted , artistically amazing , poignant study two young japanese students encouraging one follow their dreams they surprise themselves falling love . professional artist , i amazed superb quality artistry background panels , each one alone separate masterpiece , 3 dimensional feel movement/action . this not what i expected . most striking element this masterpiece ( risk trite ) slice modern japanese life/culture it imparted me . characters real , while same time decent , moral kids . there certain innocence characters totally refreshing endearing . they projected almost spiritual reverence their elders total respect their teachers . because japanese culture shown " user friendly " , their parents no fear their kids traveling bikes rapid transit throughout tokyo . it quite charming follow various characters through their daily activities reminded me my own childhood before our american culture became so dangerous . i now own many miyazaki films including porco rosso , kiki delivery service , princess mononoke , spirited away , castle sky , few others . however , my personal favorite still whisper heart . i can't wait introduce my nieces nephews these fantastic beautiful stories .	1
i liked this film alot agree most positive comments ( some negative .. swings remind me shock aka beyond door ii ) . my comment/question bit spoiler those who haven't seen it . it seems me ' infection ' metaphor medical malpractice it begins apathy lack caring patients . ending , upon re-watching it , i notice head nurse who returns gets ' infected ' when she doesn't want sign patient . ( clipboard scene ) . other medic ( emt ? ) insists so she finally signs it . seems doom her . that what i got film , i dig j-horror but much it cultural that what makes it so interesting . i lucky see ju two asian women who explained tons stuff i never would've understood so i'm sure there lots i didn't ' get ' infection .	1

" mothman prophecies " one most underrated contemporary horror films i've ever seen . i only saw this once awhile ago , but i remember amazed movie this good could swept under rug it seemingly . richard gere ( yeah , i know ) plays washington post reporter named john klein who loses his wife very curious car accident . after accident which purposely filmed so we don't know how or why it really happened , his terminally damaged wife starts drawing really weird pictures moth . she keeps asking klein if he saw this bird sorts or not , kind dracula-like figure two eyes too bright make one comfortable . first he insists he saw nothing but keeps pictures , childlike chilling images playing perennial part film later . patton best actor this movie . he plays gordon smallwood , outwardly small town nut actually man driven insane bizarre enigma this innocuous little town unknowingly houses . when klein shows up gordon house ( rifle shoved his face ) , it not accident . nothing this movie really . way pellington shoots scenes gordon losing his mind unforgettable -- it happens fizzy , weird video game type way which comes off very vividly . i've never liked laura linney too much always felt she belongs tv but she decent job connie mills , local sherrif who basically serves dramatic witness klein breakdowns real star movie -- indrid cold -- keeps calling him . only " exorcist " or " black christmas " , perhaps , i seen movie before which creepy , otherworldly voice becomes star . even when klein tries escape his obsession tear out jack phone , it keeps ringing ringing . this exercise derangement strange form hope . climax strike some impressive others senseless . bottom line : every horror fan should see this .	1

story drags bit beginning , but end , my wife i ended up enjoying movie quite bit . voice acting great all around ( especially shatner possum prone playing possum ) cgi animation fine . much movie seemed very familar - especially set piece end which lifted directly $300 episode futurama - but like they say , if you're going steal , steal best . ben folds music highpoint ( stick around his kid friendly rendition rockin ' suburbs ) . extras pretty good highlights extensive footage actors performing their lines , additional cartoon featuring original cast , sneak preview jerry seinfeld bee movie . all all , i recommend this fans animation	1
thornton , . . ( writer ) ( 1996 ) . sling blade . . meistrich ( producer ) . usa : criterion collection . thornton plays lead role carl , developmentally disabled ( autistic ? ) man his 40s who spent most his life small-town texas resident psychiatric hospital . his crime double homicide his mother her teenaged lover . we also learn his father mother him bury infant brother immediately after his birth while still alive . carl , whose heart seeking purity justice but whose mind not equipped deal well evil world , released hospital after 25 years becomes friends frank ( black ) , 12-year-old boy whose mother , linda ( canerday ) , hooked up abusive alcoholic boyfriend , doyle ( yoakam ) , whom she hopes go away his own accord . linda best friend her grocery store boss , vaughan ( ritter ) , who gay who stays small town he finds oppressive largely because his love linda frank but also because his own fears inability deal larger world . carl relationship frank father-protector figure grows , doyle becomes more threatening everyone safety , carl makes decision protect frank linda murdering doyle . when asked fellow resident ( walsh ) what world outside like , carl says simply it too big . this beautifully made movie struggle good evil its major concern development safety frank , young boy . carl enters this fallen world discover mother who suffering battered wife syndrome can't act way protect her son . vaughan , other good adult , equally incapable helping frank . his own part , frank despises doyle but too young helpless anything except seek protection carl . carl , portrayed thornton , idiot savant who masterful repairing small engines , equally adept providing shelter frank , who comes rely carl he would his own nurturing father . carl displays many characteristics servant leadership delineated spears ( greenleaf , beazley , beggs , spears , 2003 , pp . 16-19 ) , notably listening , empathizing , healing , his effect other players equally remarkable servant-leader terms . example , one scene portrays dinner vaughan holds his house frank , linda , carl , his boyfriend albert ( tim holder ) , developmentally disabled grocery store worker melinda ( christy ward ) whom vaughan matchmaking carl . scene understated contemplative its vignette community building , wry humor reveals fact everyone store knows vaughan albert lovers , which vaughan thought secret , echoing movie theme world " too big " - too callous mean-spirited sensitive people live unharmed lives . carl also displays qualities foresight commitment growth people his relationship frank . this ultimately leads him conclude only way frank grow up undamaged , implication doyle may actually become drunkenly enraged kill linda frank . carl ends up killing doyle act premeditated sacrifice dark it gets . he acts frank protector but also returns himself contrastingly small world mental hospital , where he spends most his time sitting chair , looking out window . there much more detail nuance this movie i can't capture couple paragraphs , but movie melancholy deep well worth watching . get some more flavor it , see http://imdb.com/title/tt0117666/quotes few pages dialogue excerpts	1
we watched this dvd last night , i think it may surpassed everything else we've watched now top my list . wow . amazing ! i love when band sounds just good they when they first hit music scene . wonderful plus this concert frey , henley walsh also sing their own songs so it like getting bonus concert . joe walsh quite entertaining ! definitely must see - i'm already looking forward watching it again	1
i love this movie . zombies , yakuza , samurai , possibly even vampire ( i think that what main villian ) crazy monkey yakuza man who pulls guns , literally , out his arse . what there not love ? i think whoever called " kung fu evil dead " most accurate description movie i could possibly imagine . plus , little knocks movie makes " matrix " really funny . however , i must warn you . not watch it english-dubbed ! it worst dubbing i ever heard . i owned this dvd months before girl i over wanted see it , but didn't want read subtitles . i am convinced there only two actors doing all voices english version . seriously , every male sounds like it same guy trying different voices . only worse english-dubbing i've ever heard dutch version " ichi killer , " but , least , funny how bad it sounds . also , r-rated version , which i saw first , actually cuts some important stuff out film . i rented r-rated version then bought special edition there two or three scenes i like , " ooooh ! so that why happened ! " seriously , they butchered film r-rated version . but if you like slightly campy , ultra-violent , let throw every idea we ever into one film type-movies , go it	1
watched this movie no less than 20 times . love it everytime i watch it .... just love sandra bullock , when you mix it harry conack you can't beat it . you love it if you romantic heart !!	1
intent director capture atmosphere or " flavor " elizabethan court . intrigue , alliances , deceit , ambitions , trechery emotions . addition he means show us elizabeth human thrust into power , all power demands . those points he got it right although people not quite clean good looking then . times brutal . toothache could kill you . lice everywhere . those who criticize historical accuracy complaints miss point . historically accurate film would span very very many hours or even more . movie probably could little longer it . worthy multiple viewings	1
i see lot positive reviews posted here ... historical luther not found this movie . no doubt audience predominantly lutheran . secular entertainment point view , i would agree them . 4 stars . attention detail excellent ; it well acted , well written , well casted . however , director eric till made luther into hero . he no hero . history reveals truth so glaringly absent film . only thing rang true luther anti-establishment , religious zealot reformer , just like jesus , ( only jesus hated gentiles , calling them " dogs swine ) . " i challenge till make " luther part 2 , " using excerpts luther own words below script . it smack hitler biography/// . disclaimer : if you lutheran , brace yourself . he blatently advocated slow genocide jews . hitler picked up what luther throwin ' down ... " jewish vermin ... shall their homes razed ... curfews set ... business banned ... " etc . this luther never portrayed . ad hominem or not , how lutheranism trusted when it founder such hateful individual ? jews their lies , martin luther " i made up my mind write no more either jews or against them . but since i learned these miserable accursed people not cease lure themselves even us , , christians , i published this little book , so i might found among those who opposed such poisonous activities jews who warned christians their guard against them . i would not believed christian could duped jews into taking their exile wretchedness upon himself . however , devil god world , wherever god word absent he easy task , not only weak but also strong . may god help us . amen . he not call them abraham children , but " brood vipers " [ matt . 3:7 ] . oh , too insulting noble blood race israel , they declared , " he demon ' [ matt 11:18 ] . our lord also calls them " brood vipers " ; furthermore john 8 [: 39 , 44 ] he states : " if you abraham children ye would what abraham .... you your father devil . it intolerable them hear they not abraham but devil children , nor they bear hear this today . therefore blind jews truly stupid fools ... now just behold these miserable , blind , senseless people . ... their blindness arrogance solid iron mountain . learn this , dear christian , what you doing if you permit blind jews mislead you . then saying truly apply , " when blind man leads blind man , both fall into pit " [ cf . luke 6:39 ] . you cannot learn anything them except how misunderstand divine commandments ... therefore your guard against jews , knowing wherever they their synagogues , nothing found but den devils which sheer self-glory , conceit , lies , blasphemy , defaming god men practiced most maliciously veheming his eyes them . moreover , they nothing but thieves robbers who daily eat no morsel wear no thread clothing which they not stolen pilfered us means their accursed usury . thus they live day day , together wife child , theft robbery , arch-thieves robbers , most impenitent security . however , they not acquired perfect mastery art lying ; they lie so clumsily ineptly anyone who just little observant easily detect it . but us christians they stand terrifying example god wrath . if i refute all other articles jewish faith , i should obliged write against them much long time they used inventing their lies -- , longer than two thousand years . ... christ his word hardly recognized because great vermin human ordinances . however , let this suffice time their lies against doctrine or faith . i not tell you earlier jew such noble , precious jewel god all angels dance when he farts ? alas , it cannot anything but terrible wrath god which permits anyone sink into such abysmal , devilish , hellish , insane baseness , envy , arrogance . if i avenge myself devil himself i should unable wish him such evil misfortune god wrath inflicts jews , compelling them lie blaspheme so monstrously , violation their own conscience . anyway , they their reward constantly giving god lie . no , one should toss out these lazy rogues seat their pants . ... but then eject them forever this country . , we heard , god anger them so intense gentle mercy only tend make them worse worse , while sharp mercy reform them but little . therefore , any case , away them ! over above we let them get rich our sweat blood , while we remain poor they suck marrow our bones . i brief , dear princes lords , those you who jews under your rule -- if my counsel not please your , find better advice , so you we all rid unbearable , devilish burden jews , lest we become guilty sharers before god lies , blasphemy , defamation , curses which mad jews indulge so freely wantonly against person our lord jesus christ , this dear mother , all christians , all authority , ourselves . not grant them protection , safe-conduct , or communion us .... . this faithful counsel warning i wish cleanse exonerate my conscience . let government deal them this respect , i suggested . but whether government acts or not , let everyone least guided his own conscience form himself definition or image jew . however , we must avoid confirming them their wanton lying , slandering , cursing , defaming . nor dare we make ourselves partners their devilish ranting raving shielding protecting them , giving them food , drink , shelter , or other neighborly acts . therefore we christians , turn , obliged not tolerate their wanton conscious blasphemy . accordingly , it must dare not considered trifling matter but most serious one seek counsel against this save our souls jews , , devil eternal death . what shall we christians this rejected condemned people , jews ? since they live among us , we dare not tolerate their conduct , now we aware their lying reviling blaspheming . if we , we become sharers their lies , cursing blaspemy . thus we cannot extinguish unquenchable fire divine wrath , which prophets speak , nor we convert jews . prayer fear god we must practice sharp mercy see whether we might save least few glowing flames . we dare not avenge ourselves . vengeance thousand times worse than we could wish them already them throat . i shall give you my sincere advice : first set fire their synagogues or schools bury cover dirt whatever not burn , so no man ever again see stone or cinder them . this honor our lord christendom , so god might see we christians , not condone or knowingly tolerate such public lying , cursing , blaspheming his son his christians . whatever we tolerated past unknowingly - i myself unaware it - pardoned god . but if we , now we informed , protect shield such house jews , existing right before our very nose , which they lie , blaspheme , curse , vilify , defame christ us ( heard above ) , it would same if we doing all this even worse ourselves , we very well know . second , i advise their houses also razed destroyed . they pursue them same aims their synagogues . instead they might lodged under roof or barn , like gypsies . this bring home them they not masters our country , they boast , but they living exile captivity , they incessantly wail lament us before god . third , i advise all their prayer books talmudic writings , which such idolatry , lies , cursing blasphemy taught , taken them ... fourth , i advise their rabbis forbidden teach henceforth pain loss life limb . they justly forfeited right such office holding poor jews captive saying moses ( deuteronomy 17 [: 10 ff . ]) which he commands them obey their teachers penalty death , although moses clearly adds : " what they teach you accord law lord . " those villains ignore . they wantonly employ poor people obedience contrary law lord infuse them this poison , cursing , blasphemy . same way pope also held us captive declaration matthew 16 [: 18 ] , " you peter , " etc ., inducing us believe all lies deceptions issued his devilish mind . he not teach accord word god , therefore he forfeited right teach . fifth , i advise safe-conduct highways abolished completely jews . they no business countryside , since they not lords , officials , tradesmen , or like . let they stay home ... sixth , i advise usury prohibited them , all cash treasure silver gold taken them put aside safekeeping . reason such measure , said above , they no other means earning livelihood than usury , it they stolen robbed us all they possess . such money should now used no other way than following : whenever jew sincerely converted , he should handed one hundred , two hundred , or three hundred florins , personal circumstances may suggest . this he could set himself up some occupation support his poor wife children , maintenance old or feeble . such evil gains cursed if they not put use god blessing good worthy cause . seventh , i commend putting flail , ax , hoe , spade , distaff , or spindle into hands young , strong jews jewesses letting them earn their bread sweat their brow , imposed children adam ( gen 3 [: 19 ]} . it not fitting they should let us accursed goyim toil sweat our faces while they , holy people , idle away their time behind stove , feasting farting , top all , boasting blasphemously their lordship over christians means our sweat . no , one should toss out these lazy rogues seat their pants . but what happen even if we burn down jews ' synagogues forbid them publicly praise god , pray , teach , utter god name ? they still keep doing it secret . if we know they doing this secret , it same if they doing it publicly . our knowledge their secret doings our toleration them implies they not secret after all thus our conscience encumbered it before god . accordingly , it must dare not considered trifling matter but most serious one seek counsel against this save our souls jews , , devil eternal death . my advice , i said earlier , : first , their synagogues burned down , all who able toss sulphur pitch ; it would good if someone could also throw some hellfire . would demonstrate god our serious resolve evidence all world it ignorance we tolerated such houses , which jews reviled god , our dear creator father , his son most shamefully up till now but we now given them their due reward . i wish i ask our rulers who jewish subjects exercise sharp mercy toward these wretched people , suggested above , see whether this might not help ( though it doubtful ) . they must act like good physician who , when gangrene set , proceeds without mercy cut , saw , burn flesh , veins , bone , marrow . such procedure must also followed this instance . burn down their synagogues , forbid all i enumerated earlier , force them work , deal harshly them , moses wilderness , slaying three thousand lest whole people perish . they surely not know what they doing ; moreover , people possessed , they not wish know it , hear it , or learn it . there it would wrong merciful confirm them their conduct . if this not help we must drive them out like mad dogs , so we not become partakers their abominable blasphemy all their other vices thus merit god wrath damned them . i my duty . now let everyone see his . i am exonerated . " my essay , i hope , furnish christian ( who any case no desire become jew ) enough material not only defend himself against blind , venomous jews , but also become foe jews ' malice , lying , cursing , understand not only their belief false but they surely possessed all devils . may christ , our dear lord , convert them mercifully preserve us steadfastly immovably knowledge him , which eternal life .

i took look first dvd this series after reading malcolm gladwell books , harford " undercover economist " , " freakonomics " , " long tail " . i didn't expect too much , then ended up devouring all six hours . my education economics almost entirely summarized books above , so overview economic history , i found this series terrific . three disc , six hour long public televsion documentary , series very comprehensive one hundred or so years it covers . considering i slept through my one college economics class , i also surprised find it entertaining its " battle ideas " take economics its demonstrations success failure many nations under many economic systems . i don't think it produced accomodate political agenda everyone watching it ; six hours quite enough . because pbs produced " commanding heights " , i honestly expected it six hour screed evils walmart foreign labor . it actually quite opposite ; demonstration how free , competitive markets very limited regulation provide best overall economic conditions while government controlled markets lead empty stores bread lines . mixed economies work only short term solutions booms busts completely unregulated free compeitition . not really " laissez faire " economics , but very discriminative use government regulation create best economic conditions --" hold loosely " economics , maybe . very loosely , probably . whole series nutshell me . series also presents interesting view how world leadership works way you'll never see presidential documentary or six o'clock news . when your decisions affect hundreds millions , you use best ideas , presented best minds careful not your decision swayed dogmatic screamers who only point out problems , but never present well planned solutions . however , screamers essential . leadership decisions far always correct . disc 3 , when one attendees wto conference asked where he would 25 years earlier , he answered he'd outside protesting . now , he felt real solutions inside . labor leader interviewed said it wasn't job protesters solutions , but check power letting failings power known . three cheers both those answers i think . it role leaders come up best plan they think possible public let their dissatisfaction known via their right protest . i see thomas jefferson loving whole idea . there interesting stories told documentary : how milton friedman professors chicago school economics recruited around world their ideas implemented save national economies ; how economists called help win polish revolution ; how margaret thacher took out friedrich von hayek book free market economies out meeting tossed it table ; how von hayek wait until his old age until his theories embraced ; how richard nixon other conservatives abandoned their posts free market economics watched things get worse . i also learned one problems free trade ( other than exportation domestic jobs ) not so much low wages paid foreign countries , but how many these countries don't grant their citizens property rights , so even if their overall conditions improve , they never prosper because they can't really make claim anything they own . it seems their could definitely some simple policy decisions made there would improve things . one wonder why they not made .	1

i bought this without previously knowing anything it , not knowing it sequel . i taken title , blurb . that it . it sounded like really romantic film , one i might identify , i've always wondered what would happen if i met my first love again , if i would same feelings . after watching very , very long trailer , i slightly disappointed , i only managed half hour into film , before i started doze off . it so incredibly boring ! although i wouldn't say i normally mind " real time " films , it all set mid-late afternoon , very dull time day if you ask me . it only time day director richard linklater would shoot scenes film . he felt it added reality film , often relied actors get perfect takes right time , it shows , it shot mere 15 days . but it nothing but talk meandering around parisian streets parts i watched . i just didn't identify it . nothing happened . i hated two actors . i don't normally like ethan hawke anyway , but i thought i might able ignore this , but no i disliked julie delpy too . i wouldn't recommend this film anyone , although i know other reviewers gonna disagree me , but it just wasn't what i expected .	-1

friend once who snickered my enthusiasm this movie . brainless cretin described it " chick flick " i give him long winded explanation why he once more way off beam . " goodwill hunting " classic guy movie guys who guy things . above all other story elements , this movie boyhood friends uncompromising loyalty those friendships . there scenes here should make you miss buddies you turned age , those great friends who there when you your first drink , chased your first skirt got into your first bar brawl . hunting genius becomes crux film . he genius , yes . but mostly , he young man typical frustrations misgivings come age . he issues girls , issues law , issues his own place world . this quickly became one my all-time favorites because it movie endless depth substance . story young punk criminal record outshining rest mathematical minds compelling start . so attempt bedraggled but committed psychiatrist reach boy weird friendship forms them . south boston serves beautiful shabby backdrop hunting feels himself drifting away his buddies his genius gets more attention world universities prestige he unfamiliar . he wants continue working construction hanging out seedy bars his friends , rather than his fluke ability exploited men greedy ambitions concerns over petty things like tenure . matt damon stellar streetwise hunting , orphan attitude . robin williams leaves his goofiness behind plays aging psychiatrist who once tough young man just like kid he trying help . while praising pair , no one should overlook talents ben affleck , who credible actor before he started landing tabloid covers . relationship damon affleck powerful . latter knows his childhood friend bound great things prods him achieve silent , macho way good friends . " if you're still here ten years , i'll kill you . that not threat , it fact . i'll freakin ' kill you , " affleck says , two take time beer during lunch break work . because how good friends talk each other when crucial matters hand . watching hunting battle himself he ponders idea flying away tough but familiar streets he grew up only half allure this film . each character comes into hunting world rich dynamic , somehow vital decisions young genius needs make . this one never far off my top five list all-time movie greats . not just because it great see tough southy intellectually thrashing silver spoon college kid , either	1

i'm good friend haskell wexler , edited his film , " medium cool , " 1968 . this film came out year before required viewing all us -- especially because way it made scripted story look like documentary . i loved film back then but hadn't seen it again until last week . i admit i bit worried it would appear dated irrelevant . quite contrary ! given events since 9/11 , iraq , madrid , london , lebanon -- west global struggle against islam -- this film more important relevant today than ever . there one sequence particular which three arab women disguise themselves europeans order slip bombs past french colonial checkpoints plant them locations where they kill maximum number europeans . i won't spoil extraordinary suspense this sequence telling you whether or not they succeed . they not suicide bombers , but they place their deadly packages they look around people they kill . it simply one best pieces pure cinema ever	1

i never heard this film before i saw it sale target . fan johnny depp , i picked up last copy store under ten bucks . film opens , i thought , " well , i guess there reason why movies you've never heard go sale . " but , even i thought this , there still quality this film captivated me . even though pacing slow first , images dialogue seamed saying , " if you pay attention , i'm pretty important .

this film really spectacular . very opening(which slightly disorienting-but becomes clear quickly ) , it weaves tale filled some very odd fascinating characters . nicholson plays radio deejay sorts spouts some fictionalized , but engrossingly told tales . story itself deals his visit his brother-played bruce dern , who he must attempt talk out some financial scheming . dern turns fine performance-comparable his performance smile(very different characters , both great performances ) . ellen burstyn also terrific . photography laszlo kovacs ranks up his best . welcome follow-up rafelson five easy pieces(a follow-up doesn't get press it deserves ) . looks beautiful dvd	1
trevor ( osment ) good kid living hard life . he constantly taking care himself while his single mother ( helen hunt , pitch perfect ) works job after job he continually battle her her alcohol problem , she hides bottles he finds drains them . this story mother-son relationship heart ' pay it forward ' , actual paying it forward ( school project trevor comes up ) many ways sub-plot here , not other way around . you see , trevor bright young boy ( 11 or so ) whose new teacher ( kevin spacey , always brilliant ) gives them ' beginning year ' assignment come up way change world , better . he doesn't feel any kids actually come up anything substantial , but then again he never student quite like trevor . trevor comes up plan , utopian idea ( now look up :p ) where one person something good 3 people who turn something good 3 more people , never same people , always someone different , idea , rediculous it may sound actually worked word it got out reached struggling news reporter ( jay mohr ) who decides story trevor his idea . like i said , all this nothing more than sub-plot . heart soul this story bond forms these 3 unlikely souls . mother whose always trying so hard right thing but life her can't make right choices . teacher who afraid change fear hurting anymore than he already boy caught middle heart gold . your story what touching moving story it . helen hunt top her game this beautiful story learning love , kevin spacey , always brilliant , convincing heart breaking his sicerity . young haley joel osment brilliant young actor i'm sure , promise he showed movies like this one , a.i. his oscar nominated performance sixth sense , he come back guns blazing once he through awkward stages those teenage years ! great film oscar ignored , but thats nothing new it ?	1

" broken flowers " realistic movie explosions , gun fights , car chases . real life nobody acts like this or talks like this . that not say movie realistic good , but it helps if somebody least resembles human . bill murray meets up old girlfriends he hasn't seen 20 years , these meetings ridiculous . real life people show more emotion or some type reaction , they usually talk . this movie they just sit there stare each other almost nothing say . why this interesting ? it torture . when they finally talk , everything said random vague . reality people try carry normal conversation . even strangest people it , i've seen it . people say director jim jarmusch takes " minimalist " approach . nothing " spelled out you " , you " think " . " if you don't get it , watch your explosions movie " . it reminds me modern abstract painting , one blank white canvas except orange square . people rave it deep meaning it hanging met . meanwhile i paint orange square blank canvas . so you . i also make this movie , just give me some cameras , cinematographer some money . while watching , my head i filling dialogue characters , my dialogue lot more interesting than anything these people say . i enjoyed bill murray " lost translation " . his deap-pan performance worked there . least movie characters something say , stuff happened . here we long shots bill murray laying couch , or just simply staring into space . looong shots . only character vaguely resembled human winston , bill murray neighbor . he somehwat amusing he actually talked ! i don't need movies mirror reality enjoy them , nor i need everything spelled out me . my favorite type painting impressionism , which looks nothing like reality if you stare it . but right perspective good one looks more realistic than photorealistic painting . this movie , orange square nothing but orange square , people staring into space nothing but people staring into space	-1

i remember when " willow " first came out big screen . i remember how cool it watch skull-helmeted general kael ride onto screen . i loved swordplay madmartigan . trolls creepiest things i've ever seen . flash forward twenty-eight years , " willow " lost some its luster . it doesn't appeal me much it when i youngster . however , it still great film watch your family . those uneducated , " willow " tale one willow ufgood , little man who stumbles upon child " giant " person . this particular child bears mark which proclaims her person who eventually overthrow evil powerful queen bavmorda . bavmorda sent out her warriors murder every baby kingdom until she finds one mark . when dog-like beasts attack willow nelwyn village , he instructed take child give her first daikini he finds . this where madmartigan enters scenery . he mildly agrees help willow his quest , but things eventually turn into one great escape after . climactic battle good evil inevitable . willow played warwick davis . fans horror know him leprechaun " leprechaun " films . fans sci-fi know him playing wicket , ewok friend princess leia " return jedi . " he also provided body marvin " hitchhiker guide galaxy . " rest cast built up huge future stars , little legends , established character actors . billy barty bit role nelwyn village wizard . val kilmer portrays madmartigan , slightly oafish , very deadly swordsman who aids willow his quest . everyone should know kilmer . he tons films " real genius " " island dr. moreau " his legendary turn doc holliday " tombstone . " jean marsh portrays bavmorda , , much like reviewer stated , she seems channeling evil queens older disney flicks . joanne whalley ( sorsha ) pat roach ( kael ) round out very reliable cas t.t he special effects look very dated compared today films . however , it should stated this film early pioneer modern special effects . there even documentary dvd explaining beginnings " morphing . " overall , this film aged relatively well far family film . it rather violent moments , but it overall safe film watch your kids long they handle violence level films such 80 fantasy fest , " krull . " i don't recall much bad language all , but warned there quite few deaths this film , impaling swords eaten very " rancor " monster-like two-headed dragon . you'll also notice number references bible , " lord rings " books . if you grew up this film i , you'll probably enjoy memories film . however , it rather boring times adults . i'd still add it my collection if i you , if no other reason but enjoy it your own children see amazement their eyes once sparkled yours .	1

it hard know where begin this one . movie immaculately filmed one greatest directors all time , given just most perfect presentation i've ever seen dvd . i guess i'll start print : it magnificent , beautiful , golden colors , sharp focus , barely speck dust film . one would expect kurosawa film , composition feast eyes , beautiful formal balances coming most mundane elements shot . ( george lucas very influenced kurosawa many ways , but this sort beautiful , balanced composition one thing he never mastered . ) then there score . most people might not immediately think score when discussing kurosawa film , but i struck here how powerful distinctive it , while same time it never gets way film . then there sets : simple , yet used maximum effect . this not big budget film hollywood standards ( though it most expensive japanese film up time ) , but it feels far more epic than any recent , very expensive star wars " prequels , " which just goes show it takes more make epic than just money . kurosawa reportedly only used something like 200 horsemen , yet you'll think you're seeing far more . then there cast . tatsuya nakadai , lord ichimonji , manages perfectly portray man going man who both frightening his stubbornness sympathetic his pathos same time . not easy job , especially under ton makeup made him look far older than he . three sons , played akira terao , jinpachi nezu especially daisuke ryu ( insightful loyal saburo ) distinctive well-developed . androgynous peter ( first name billed only ) kyoami memorable his flamboyant , almost drag-queen gyrations taunting aging , increasingly senile warlord insights into his predicament . yet standout performance , one i always remember , stunning mieko harada lady kaede . while ran supposedly loose retelling king lear , kaede more lady macbeth than anything else . she two very memorable scenes both involve severed heads . while screenplay riffs lear , it also makes some notable changes . three daughters replaced three sons . this " lear " goes mad not because daughter love but because , apparently , weight wars fought past . young lord very odds image we see beginning film , man wishing make peace his demons . we discover through backstory he killed , kidnapped waged much violence bring together his kingdom , yet now he just wants peace goodwill . i thinking adage what goes around comes around , wondered if hidetora himself ever came this realization . it what he thinking he emerged burning castle after tremendous battle , dazed , wordless ? scene , shot without ambient sound but haunting score ( composed toru takemitsu ) , must go down one greatest moments film , example how cinema used way no other art form . bonus features both bountiful meaningful . first there full-length commentary film scholar stephen prince , though i confess i've not yet listened it . director sidney lumet gives brief appreciation kurosawa ran . he likens film late beethoven quartets or seventh symphony . such comparisons often come off glib or meaningless , but this actually struck chord me . i indeed think comparison ran energies seventh apt , introspection reminds me late quartets , particularly op . 132 . second disc , we a.k. , 75 minute documentary kurosawa life . ( case you've seen recent pbs documentary kurosawa , this one different . ) then comes half hour film making ran , which shows what grueling shoot it must , going every day base mount fuji often working there even night . finally there 35-minute video piece exploring costumes ran , well new video interview tatsuya nakadai ( lord hidetora ) . there also color booklet interviews kurosawa composer takemitsu . short , there enough supplementary materials here keep any fan movie or director happy weeks . many criterion releases defined what dvds , but this title just takes cake . what more could one ask , short summoning kurosawa beyond talk film ? even if you own ran one its other video versions , they all vastly inferior this release . if you've never seen film , or any work akira kurosawa , this probably best place you could start . highly highly recommended	1

i first saw this movie sixties , when its expose rome decadent jet set still some shock value . four decades later , when mating habits movie stars endlessly dissected across globe , trials tribulations sweet life feel numbingly familiar . what left story marcello , ( marcello mastroianni ) gossip columnist , what happens him during series loosely structured night wanderings . trailing marcello through rome , we learn his character discern his fate . he aspired once intellectual , idealizes his friend steiner , imagining steiner life perfect blend serious purpose family warmth . what happens steiner provides movie only true emotional shock . marcello traveling salesman father shows up unexpectedly rome . marcello wants him stay longer so they get know each other better . but , after raucous evening town , old man bolts once again . we see source marcello emotional guardedness . this guardedness affects his romantic relationships . there emma , his steady girlfriend , who wants commitment he unwilling provide . he dallies instead movie stars , such sylvia ( anita ekberg , whose zaftig charms show us how much standards cinematic beauty changed over forty years . ) his most interesting relationship maddelena ( anouk aimee ) decadent aristocrat . there definitely chemistry them , but neither them put aside their party masks long enough explore it . his most moving encounter young girl country , waitress seaside resort . jaded marcello drawn her innocence optimism , because it takes him back his younger self , fresh arrival big city . movie end , after debauched night , he sees this girl beach dawn , standing other side channel . she shouts him , gestures , but wind snatches away her words . he can't connect her . shrugging , he turns back his bleary-eyed troupe nightlifers . this rich movie , its energetic inventions keep you hooked , even though it almost three hours long . you would expect one cinema world masters , there lot artful filmmaking here - innovative night photography , playful musical score brilliant nino rota , arresting visuals , such opening shot statue jesus airlifted helicopter over city . many fellini major preoccupations display well . his nostalgia simple , natural life country played out marcello interactions young waitress . carnival italian catholicism brought hilariously life when two young children claim visions virgin mary way jerking chains their elders . adults , desperate miracle , swarm site . marcello paparazzi could care less , long there enough spectacle squeeze out story or visual . pretensions urban intellectuals wittily skewered during party scene steiner where bombastic people talk past each other several languages . some most appealing aspects fellini movies aren't all evident la dolce vita . his warmth towards his characters , instance . starlets , aristocrats tabloid journalists marcello runs aren't very likable . without his easy charm , this would cold movie indeed . also , fellini best there using cinematic imagery create dreamlike flow his stories . but this movie full abrupt , even awkward transitions , though fellini , following marcello through warren rome streets , keeps hitting dead ends which force him back up order go forward . although fellini starting move away his neorealistic roots la dolce vita , he doesn't move very far . when he finally returned those roots , he made amarcord , amazing fusion realism surrealism . me , it fellini best movie , perhaps one greatest movies ever made . la dolce vita isn't good amarcord , much its shock value diluted time , but it worth seeing mastroianni seemingly effortless virtuosity privilege watching great director capture passing parade .	1
this great series originally aired bbc also played food network . i saw it when it aired food network i so happy see it coming dvd . it great show really gives you inside look what it takes get resturaunt off ground . if wasn't hard enough , it 15 untrained people who passion cooking but no official experience just daunting task . you'll see frustration , aggrivation when things go wrong . well jubilation when everything going right , which rarely case it seems . jamie great letting camera see exactly whats going his mind . he rarely holds back always speaks his mind when things arent going his way . end it really great look into how people cope put into situations they arent used how far people go when they passionate something . i highly reccomend this dvd any fan jamie oliver or any person thinking getting into resturaunt business . it extremely entertaining you won't disappointed all	1
this movie excellent movie stand-alone film , but sequel impeccable ocean eleven , it just doesn't satisfy you all way . film highly engaging every member cast their best ( even if they don't much part ) . plot , however , bit muddled doesn't really make sense until very end . there few funny twists turns , but ocean twelve just doesn't live up its predecessor . though disappointment sequel , i still highly recommend it	1
title says it all , i think this movie classic . good yet strange strange movie strated very crazy animated cartoon show	1
this movie loads fun ! it truly " little engine could " ! it easy point finger knock down points film because it low budget stuff , but there really isn't much room so this one . sideline secrets takes few seeds manages plant entire orchard . what i am saying fact this film best what it end it comes out true winner . actors great . i think we seeing some them bigger projects near future they clearly passion comfort what they . story very dark . it touches upon lot controversial subject matter involving molestation , rape , physical abuse , alcoholism , more . but , dont get too frightened , although much subject matter serious , movie knows how tie it all into somewhat complicated yet very entertaining story . romantic story core nice see . i am glad see movies like this climbing charts . it reached #2 bestseller spot popular online retail store . me it no wonder why . sideline secrets truly gem found many .	1
review disclaimer : my review based vhs release , anticipation this deluxe edition dvd , released october 24 , 2006 . whenever i think this movie , i get chills followed imagined warm heat . this movie fire . actors , passion , plot , settings . everything . everything ! i recommend this anyone older than 18 . it great classic holds its own , any audience ! this movie everything i love ! great plot ! passion ! sex ! beautiful women ! william hurt shines . i honestly thought , when i saw this movie , william hurt would go classic hollywood actor , picking up all types roles we've seen mel gibson , bruce willis , tom hanks picked up , over past 25 years . while mr. hurt resigned himself lesser known roles , smaller parts ; certainly non-hollywood roles . seeing this film , first time , young people ( old , matter ) might re-introduced this fine actor , showing them what many us enjoyed 25 years ago . some my favorite memorable scenes : chair through window ; ted danson peter lowenstein dancing moonlight ; windchimes matty porch ; hot florida nights ; ned racine ( william hurt ) realization scamed ; etc . if any movie , over past 25 years , most deserving sequel , or pre-quel , this it . i don't want spoil anything , but watch this movie , tell me if you don't agree , this movie deserves follow up story . not really " cliff-hanger " but it leaves you longing more . yet , still very satisfying . great movie ! mc white said : check it out !!	1
i bought this only because i loved first one , hoping it wasn't terrible second . after i watched it i so impressed . first all i loved it really didn't anything first , aside cassidy katherine cousin , sharing same last name ( there only one reference katherine sebastian beginning ) . it much better than different actors playing old characters , which drags movie down alot . i thought story great , good twists . whole cast very attractive , which can't hurt either . " bad " characters all pretty likeable , aside one , all well end . best thing this movie character cassidy . i sarted out hating her , ended up really liking her her realness , honesty she not try hide she b*tch . this actress particularly good job , pulling off both loveable , complete brat same time . i would definetly reccomend this movie .	1
saint ralph perfect movie hand entertaining houseguests or cheering someone up , since most folks haven't already seen it , it uplifting , it wide appeal ( sports , coming-of-age , dramatic storyline , funny ) . much this movie humor misunderstanding . ralph , 9th grader , gets lot wrong , perhaps since he so little guidance , his war hero father dead , his hospitalized mom entering coma , living unsupervised home faking headmaster he staying grandparents . plus , he got more typical 14-year-old problems , he object ridicule classmates can't control his hormones . after little pool incident , headmaster attempts resolve ralph horny " energy surplus " problem sentencing him cross-country team . after his coach says , " let go , 180 days left til boston marathon , " ralph asks running it , coach says he kidding , anyone team winning it would " miracle rival loaves fishes . " taken literally nurses statement it'd take miracle his mom recover , scrawny , smoker ralph then sets out win boston miracle , defiance opposition headmaster . ralph gets misguided ( comedic ) instruction out-of-date books how train fellow student ( aspiring nun/crush-interest ) requirements producing miracle . despite catholic setting , this not religious movie , secularists could easily point out ralph theology all confused movie hard work good intentions , while believers might see it picturing god responsiveness sincere , crying hearts , even if our theology not all formulated rightly . artistically , movie wonderful well , acting impeccable music fitting . ebert roeper right applying what usually cliche , " beautiful gem . " won awards toronto , palm springs , seatle . ( brief poolhouse backside nudity , some taking lord name vain . neither gratuitous .	1

all i say wow . i heard this series good but monumental understatement . this series deep . this not funny , fun series . this series full suspence , action drama beginning end . you begin yuji , learn how survive world infested giant bugs called blue , whose sole purpose destroy humanity . he meets marlene , emotionless soldier who cares nothing but getting mission completed no matter cost . story continues , there many fantasic episodes some you won't like but they benefit whole story amazing way . each episode leaves you wanting see next one . episode 26 finishes series absolutly shocking way . i'm not going spoil it anyone but you see it . you see other 25 episodes first or it won't make any sense . believe me , you won't all disappointed buying this series . this series box set also comes blue gender movie : warrior . this only downside this box set . movie sucks . if you watch it before series it might good but after movie really sucks . it just retelling series condensed form few changes . i didn't like it but you might different opinion . overall , i give this series five stars because it really earned them . i also liked dvd case like book . all you put it your shelf . buy this series if you want see amazing anime	1
karate kid around now over two decades . we bought this set four movies because we think karate kid good role model our 4-year old boy . it funny , when these movies came out , i my best not watch them because i already teenager karate kid this dorky younger teen whom i didn't any sympathy . now i am older , i see real value these movies . boy went self-absorbed " i'm so cool " dork , learning meaning self-respect dignity , while process earning respect others . this four-movie set definitely worth price if you value these personal traits . bonus we got see fourth movie which i hadn't seen before	1

" predator " one my favorite science-fiction thrillers starring arnold schwarzenegger . when i first saw this film i thought it going formulaic sci-fi film . it not . idea group hardened american commando stalked hunted down like prey alien world terrific . scenes where predator hunting them outstanding . i liked everything film , not nit-pick any flaws . when commando wipe up guerilla fighter jungle , if this just cake walk them , you don't expect what awaiting them . what awaiting them one hell awesome enemy . when jesse ventura carrying his mini-gun , you get impression there more than one predator , maybe even quite few , however film predator , not predator(s ) . when it begins take out team ease you just know your'e one heck ride . especially ease which predator takes them out . this chameleon type predator not your typical alien . this one manhunt -- literally . film highly recommended . it one wild ride great suspenseful film . i can't understand why critics blasted it when it released . thrill factor incredible . highly recommended .

night iguana always my favorite films based tennessee williams plays it great see it this sharp clean dvd . film belongs john huston much it williams that no bad thing . huston transfers play screen sympathy , empathy respect its characters , dilemmas , - most all - its lyricism . like play , film engages mind well emotions we discover bits ourselves nearly all characters . huston always good director actors here he brings out best uniformly excellent if disparate cast . richard burton , still his prime , gives one his best screen performances - acting his entire body soul instead just letting his expressive eyes wonderful voice doing all work . perhaps huston knew just how push right buttons , or perhaps script location inspired him . or maybe he simply responded sparks other cast members . ava gardner quite magnificent role finally lets her act instead mere decoration . her earthy portrayal middle-aged widow seems take her back her southern roots she displays her character wide range raw emotions just right mixture abandon self-control . against dynamic duo burton gardner , debroah kerr wisely underplays her part vaguely artistic new england spinster , getting maximum effect most subtle inflections her voice thoughtful half-pauses . such company , sue lyon fight hold her own so much through costuming she acting . but easily matching stars film grayson hall repressed decidedly butch leader group women whose burton character taking guided tour mexico . her performance more layers than initially apparent , if i remember correctly , earned hall oscar nomination . just side comment previous reviewer who went out his way criticize cyril delevanti portrayal 97 year old poet grandfather kerr character . this person obviously very little experience either old people or poetry . delevanti performance good anyone else film produces its genuinely touching moments . if i concentrated mostly actors it because night iguana such character-driven work . elements such photography , sound , music etc . good because they nothing detract performances or wonderful dialogue . only possibly distraction location but then mexico becomes almost character itself . extras dvd show just how important location film , yet decision film black white remains correct one . it draws us much closer into world rev . . lawrence shannon his temptors tormentors . brilliant film stood up well over years one i never tire seeing . new dvd makes it look good new adds couple interesting , if brief , extras . definitely classic	1

i am big fan office , mockumentaries mentioned , just good old regular documentaries , which often funny unintentionally . i thought there few bright moments this otherwise strained mockumentary . but not nearly enough make it worth watching . i just didn't like it all . although i must say it mocked everything bad today affluent yuppie culture . my money i'll take utterly horrid couple best show - lawyers braces ! my mac , starbucks ! it sooo good .

we seen so many films , documentaries , photo essays it difficult accept this particular film all happened accident . likely hood two film makers , cameras loaded ready , driven tragic event real life heros victims still unbelieveable even though i first saw this historical footage few years back . it not documentary , it real time life happening ( like security camera ) before viewers eyes . must see .	1
hyperbole won't seem appropriate most people , but me this single most un-enjoyable movie i've ever seen , ever . every aspect it painful . first , production values : this movie just ugly . i guess biological computers supposed novel or deep concept , but it just disgusting really very poor looking . times i thought they just rooted through medical examiner dumpster gather props . i understand you can't really nice props low-budget movie , but setting technology so central plot you think they could've paid decent production designer . everyone says this not " special effects " movie ideas behind it what counts , but plenty low budget movies didn't look this bad able convey something new . acting : just one thing sea annoyances here jude law accent . it terrible , he lets his native one slip several times . it distracting sloppy . dialogue just bad overall , so i blame writer most this . this movie not " misunderstood . " it objectively bad movie . it unentertaining , boring , scrabbling significance only scraggly-bearded philosophy majors care dogmatize . lot reviews said it better see it black comedy , but this movie only unintentionally funny , if all . i'd give it zero stars if i could , i'm trying warn people away this turd	-1
this dvd set i've waiting all these years ! i've mash fan since 1972 , this ultimate dvd collection . all elevan seasons , including goodbye , farewell amen . also includes feature turn off laugh track , reportedly , cast never liked laugh track . hours special features like mash 30th anniversary show much more ! you view scenes not broadcast television over 20 years due editing commercial time . blooper feature short length , packaging needs alot space store , but this well worth price . only way this could better if alan alda delivered it personally .	1
i remember enjoying this when i rented it quite some time ago . i thought some street conversations little off didn't feel right , but i impressed over all . i writing review ' company ' trying figure out why i kept thinking there something wrong picture . it this film , actually . blockbuster rental very dark overly saturated ntsc . however , i remember adjusting my nec studio monitor just this dvd quite shaken how much dynamic range they'd squeezed into it ... more than usually possible ntsc . picture mastering seemed geared more playback pro equipment , rather than neutral one home . either they didn't use ntsc-calibrated monitor , or something like general gamma value botched before master sent duplication ... maybe just moved decimal point . it hassle compensate this playback end , but odd way almost worth it such film-like curve probably wouldn't possible otherwise . not necessarily bad thing , but it worth pointing out it might not look right your screen . i'm not sure if newer pressings different .	1

richard donner " maverick " probably deserves ample recognition among funniest westerns ever made since mel brooks " blazin ' saddles " . based atypical 1960s television western starring james garner , mel gibson great job taking over garner suave , debonair gambler brett maverick , en route world series poker saint louis , missouri . he joins forces younger , ambitious gambler annabelle bransford ( jodie foster ) , who sly fox , older u . . marshal zane cooper ( james garner ) sympathetic indian pal ( graham greene ) . both mel gibson jodie foster hysterically funny , giving us two their finest portrayals their long cinematic careers . way they contend devious gambler ( alfred molina ) whole colorful assortment other ill-mannered wild west bad guys ( many these portrayed some legendary actors great hollywood westerns , like james coburn denver pyle . ) . donner fine job directing his cast , which apparently lot fun making this film since chemistry amongst gibson , foster garner absolutely superb	1
one major problems i encounter people who viewed this cinematic masterpiece kurosawa film pretentious boring . more importantly , truth readily available viewer if he or she just watches film . however , point film . what truth ! we viewer foreknowledge crime criminal charged . " rashomon " always one my favorite films akira kurosawa , although i not place it top five his greatest . but kurosawa fascinating insight into truth dares us look what we hold " truth . " there any absolute truths ? if so , whose ? this film attempts let viewer decide who telling truth . relativism , [ corollary skepticism ] truth or belief truth relative position person who making statement . which turn directly questions ideal objectivity : since this undermines belief people get outside themselves order get truth . therefore , if truth depends observer viewpoint , how there universal truth -- or even absolute truth ? i believe kurosawa attempting show audience although truth may not absolute , there still truths . therefore , even though each characters kurosawa thrown into this film give us different viewpoint truth they witnessed it , individual themselves give enough their perception [ through their own objectivity ] , which truth still found . kurosawa so wonderful way giving four different versions murder rape : one witness , three versions people involved crime . me , film telling many ways , some which i am sure i am wrong , however , film fascinating way kurosawa uses non-verbal area film : visuals themselves . many kurosawa films , cinematography all talking . much gathered this film just looking scenery , trying not focus too much dialogue ; visuals themselves much , if not more , story . who telling truth ? why there different versions ? this i leave others decide themselves . film , attempt get truth really fascinating . telling sign kurosawa knew what he doing especially evident when looking reviewers amazon disagreeing each other . kurosawa what he set out : what truth ? toshiro mifune bandit who charged crime , he terrific acting job . movie also stars great takashi shimura woodsman who discovers scene crime . this classic highly recommended . however , it may not appeal all viewers . rent it first . [ i own it ] but since this film foreign , ambiguous many areas , some viewers may problems it . [ stars : 4.5	1

i found this outstanding miniseries it shame westerns like this few far ... westerns such great format showing our country its heritage . frankly , lonesome dove it americana . character interaction duvall jones makes this film masterpiece it . viewers , we drawn into lives two lifelong fiends entering twilight years their lives . former rangers , they tamed sw border territory together . then disillusioned , spent their best years personal purgatory lonesome dove ... where their only source amusement getting drunk , getting laid town only prostitute or stealing horses across border . feats valor forgotten , their self-respect diminished , they realize life opportunity passed them bye . both become determined confront death one last time . what occurs this film keen examination love two aging men , both agreeing make cattle drive montana setup ranch ..... perilous feat worth recapturing their youth self respect .... but reality , journey which they both hope not return . many us follow same path , friendships so old close one cannot easily discards one obligation other . this common thread rivets us screen . we brought into relationship call mccrea garner what meaning friendship two men who known each other so long . i cannot think any film adequately exposed this quality among men so well except lonesome dove	1

i saw this twice during its too brief(one week ! )run seattle 1987 i always showing it people later video who thought i insane , which may or may not beside point , but this one those movies , like big trouble little china , inform you someones personal sense humor taste . either you get it or you don't . i think this movie some kind psychopathic classic perfectly sends up extreme amorality spaghetti westerns prefigures homicidal men black suits later turn up pulp fiction reservoir dogs . few films top it sheer nihilistic rip-it-apart glee . i am glad it finally seen dvd its original aspect ratio , because theaters it very carefully staged widescreen compositions which lost video . cast uniformly weird wonderful : sy richardson , channeling pure self-righteous macho bad-ass blackness , joe strummer , showing surprisingly light touch comedy , dick rude , hilariously channeling psycho-punk james cagney , courtney love ( hang there , girl ! )gives truly committed performance shrill whining nancy spungen monster , pogues almost manage say their dialog , elvis costello doesn't much dialog but acquits himself well . i could go rest cast , there plenty them still mention , including especially miguel sandover , who greatest clint eastwood send-up i ever pleasure watching . watch this film ... you'll either get it ... or you won't . i laughed like hell .	1
i agree some comments robin williams went little over top this otherwise well-meaning sweet film . message film much stronger than messenger though , i found it very humane inspiring vehicle williams ' talents . very fine supporting cast . philip seymour hoffman patch prig roommate , monica potter his skeptical ( first ) love interest especially , fellow who plays truman ( tall , lanky fellow glasses ) provided comic relief ( robin williams ! quite feat ! ) . children film all real patients , they added sense realism urgency film deep abiding message compassion . this collector edition many bonus features . one i loved most shadyac commentary . you see he mission this film , you also learn lot his influences . he funny robin williams , maybe even crazy	1

one thing i always liked series murderous culprits always " uber-successful " much lose not committing crime . course , statement not my endorsement murder means end ; it just cool see those people we think " it all " resort doing away their fellow man ( or woman ) . this third season dvd compilation shares same double-sided disc format previous second season collection . unfortunately , it includes installment kate mulgrew lamentable " mrs. columbo . " though show came after these " columbo " episodes , it looks more dated , filming techniques , well awful scoring writing . fortunately , actress , she would achieve greater success " captain janeway " " star trek : voyager . " " columbo " episodes , other hand , some best show entire run . vera miles , actress i long admired , gets glamorously chew scenery likes vincent price young martin sheen wickedly delicious " lovely but lethal " . film veteran donald pleasance hams it up marvelously snooty winemaker " liquidates " his younger half-brother ( gary conway " land giants " ) cleverly titled " any old port storm " . this episode also features vito scotti , friend star peter falk appeared many " columbo " over years , including " swan song " , also among this compilation .

comedy ? thriller ? suspense ? i guess these all words or genres you could use describe this film . i would use these words if i wanted gloss over true feeling this film . i would use these words if i sell this wallow-some film distributor who didn't know any better . i would use these words lightly , because if i ever believed them battle would forever lost . this not comedy . it not thriller . it definitely not suspense . so , what it ? after viewing this film i came conclusion january man reminded me puzzle put together two-year-old . while all pieces box put together , sadly infant size brain child chose smash pieces together instead place them corresponding orders . thus , you jumbled mess wedged pieces what could overall beautiful picture . poor acting , confusing plot literally went nowhere ending felt forced premature , one see this puzzle unfixable even best puzzler world . if i those involved creation , i would definitely ashamed . begin , what wrong actors ? nobody seemed like they giving 10% much less 50% their effort this film . even great ones like keitel , kline , sarandon felt like they walking through motions equally confused eyes hearts . kline new york accent faded out throughout film giving us no glimpse his actual character . his role never fully defined , so other half time we watch him screen we just don't care him all . this one worst leading characters all time . thankfully , completely miscast team seemed more interested money than actually " acting " backs him up . keitel horrible this film . i am huge fan his body work , but this one he walked , talked , gave those emotionless eyes rest . he provided nothing value this production . same said sarandon , whose character seemed unfocused undervalued , mary elizabeth mastrantonio , who never really got her feet wet hollywood until maid marion arrived her doorstep . alan rickman wasted , well one-leveled voices danny aiello rod steiger whose only direction pat o'conner yell . other words , if you interested seeing this film acting , you greatly disappointed . second , perhaps acting overlooked strong story line ? wrong ! this most convoluted script i ever seen hollywood produce . we spend first forty minutes learning event happened two years ago never fully explained anyway . it reminded those times teacher would say class we should all listen up because this wasn't going test . then why bother . this set spiraling downfall rest film . this unavailable information also lead some pretty choppy chemistry actors . i never say kline keitel brothers . i never saw relationship sarandon possible . fact , now i think it , i didn't see any actors meshing well together because they working script focused all wrong parts . eventually , january man gets so caught up this secondary story we find ourselves rushed into ending solution seems laughable instead plausible . we even villain so confusing i don't even think he knew what he doing film . final thirty minutes this film worst parts this movie , second all parts before . whoever wrote this script must just forgotten basic rules storytelling because nothing meshed well all . finally , i would comment marketing this film could feel like cheated ticket some filmgoers . after reading some reviews this film , i expecting find myself chuckling out loud antics kevin kline his spin world investigation . i wrong . there no humor this film all . even when o'conner tried bring some , it seemed forced unhealthy . i must repeat , this not comedy . it even isn't really suspenseful , nor thrilling aspect actually thrilling . i must admit whomever sold this film company under guise it comedy should awarded " best salesman decade " award . somebody believed this film funny even pasted preview it word " comedy " written all over it . someone sold company broken product ... hook , line , sinker . i just ask you beware . overall , this film horrible . poor acting , cryptic story needed some form decoder ring understand , passionless actors , harshly branded word " comedy " , january man proves not all films should made advanced screen process should used regularly . i genuinely encourage you skip this film . no good come you watching this mess . i promise . grade : * out ****	-1
" koma " surprisingly suspenseful film . while there enough gore certainly warrant horror flick categorization , director chi-leung law delivers very old school hitchcock suspense tale . close-ups objects like foot dragging across floor leaving bloodstained trail heighten suspense move story . angelica lee fung chi-ching , girl who needs new kidney inhibitions keep her fully embracing her boyfriend , good job hits many levels hysteria jealousy drunken delirium . andy hui who plays her boyfriend , dr. tsui wai-man , hits number levels also guy love man whose hormones outpace his common sense . researcher suen ling , karena lam projects person who difficult upbringing frequently not walks shady side street . twists plot trace kidney thief who black-markets organs $ 60,000 pop never leaves you quite settled until final frame . subtitled chinese dialog often sparsely verbal picture translates well international audience . " koma " turns out pleasant , often intelligent , surprise . enjoy !	1

i looked name ( groovaloos ) i looked cover -- my gut told me not get this dvd . i went against my gut believed reviews ; i wish i'd listened my gut . those you who think it looks sounds little hokey , you're right money . they all dance , but compared what i expected , they seemed mediocre . here lowdown : ( 1 ) sound sucks - they're city park you hear instructions fine , but music isn't loud enough really " feel " something makes you want move , ( 2 ) they just seem like group people who don't naturally rhythm , but they've learned some moves ; it so not inspiring , ( 3 ) it not edgy enough , ( 4 ) it looks good if you've got group doing it , but when someone doing it alone , it just okay . overall , this dvd okay , but not great . get it only if you're truly desperate	-1

edukators very interesting german film , directed hans weingartner , three young radicals whose ideals put test . we first observe them taking part fairly commonplace demonstrations against global trade . these people , however , who determined take things beyond level protest . jan peter friends who break into homes affluent people , instead stealing anything , simply rearrange furniture other items . they leave calling card message , " your days plenty numbered , " sign it " edukators . " premise itself fascinating leads some humorous scenes well provoking thought . humor comes seeing absurd relocation objects , such putting stereo refrigerator . this , rather than conventional vandalism , kind performance art , meant create uneasiness self-examination part victims . while peter out town , his girlfriend jule jan spend time together become attracted each other . after jan introduces jule edukators ' tactics , jule convinces him help her " visit " home businessman whom she owes large sum money following car accident . man catches them they end up kidnapping him , bringing peter into action . rest film follows three friends they decide what their victim debate politics him . some these discussions interesting , though they inevitably follow predictable course ( " you parasite living off poor " vs . " i right what i earned , " paraphrase ) . businessman , however , moves arguing his captors sympathizing them , explaining he once radical himself . this real or merely ploy gain their trust ? romantic triangle further escalates tension . i liked intellectual content edukators ; it reminds us how few films today deal sympathetically characters who not only outside system , but actively oppose it . even better , movie not simply romanticize radicals demonize businessman . it actually raises more questions than it answers , which probably good thing . it not perfect film ; some situations seem bit contrived ( e.g. one them expert deactivating burglar alarms because he used work security company ) . ending more clever punchline than serious resolution matters . still , it very engaging well-acted puts new face old dilemma participating vs . fighting mainstream society .	1

flower life span nothing compared humans , yet flowers go through similar developmental stages . most memorable part flower growth blossoming progress where it goes small bud until it dwindles ground rapid withering phase . occasionally , love uses life span flower symbol affectionate spell under which two individuals bond . when flower withers , relationship turns numb , which case ferdinando " fef " cefal ( marcello mastroianni ) . fef merely stays his wife rosalia ( daniela rocca ) , societal restrictions enforced catholic church , family , public , which forces people remain married until death they part . light this notion , audience truly experience socially important comedy , which plays ideas divorce through more hideous plots such murder , deceit , other troublemaking . film opens moving train fef exits public toilet while he bumps into two sicilian police officers . quickly fef leaves them behind , he slowly makes his way through gentle zigzagging around other passengers dining car . seated while ordering roast beef two potatoes , fef continues gaze upon passing sicilian countryside , which not seem changed much since roman empire . this familiar place fef who begins disclose amusing tale why he his way home , he recollects homesick manner his hometown agramonte . this opening several suggestive nods towards fef character , his family what important agramonte , which comically profoundly illustrated story unfolds . introduction fef audience learns through his words , camera , actions characters societal progress not seem high agenda . instead audience learns how politics catholic church seem intertwined this small town . slow progress generated some very rigid guidelines , which no one seems willing challenge . this societal stalemate men only seem pay attention gossip one thing - women . this essential information , it depicts boredom helps withering flowers . story goes into great detail depict fef monotonous life . he unemployed due social status because he baron , which means he often sleeps . whenever he not sleep his exceedingly caring nurturing rosalia tends his needs while it actually seems if she only annoying him . there wonderful scene where fef escapes everyone read peace enjoy soothing breeze small fan his study while rosalia enters coffee turns off fan . fef turns fan again while rosalia turns it off smile , she serves him coffee . this scene oozes tension two while fef keeps his cool rosalia tries her best good wife . yet , it offers him opportunity begin imagine different methods how he could kill her . fef annoyance boredom he discovers stunning teen angela ( stefania sandrelli ) whom infatuates him brief look mass . fef begins think angela while he sneaks bathroom steal peak youthful girl through window . eventually , angela expresses her mutual desire fef , but they careful so they not cause scandal , or worse . this provides opportunity fef begin actually think how get rid off rosalia , which turns out comically ugly event he cannot divorce her law . audience feel empathy rosalia who tries good wife , but fef not allow it distant . simultaneously , one cannot help feel understanding fef who now begins study law how he possibly could get away murder . it sad thought , even though presentation topic jovial , people ready commit worst possible act name love . yet , it also here where film strength lays , it delivers funny depiction how pass society squelch life frown upon societal progress , which big deal 1960s . notion arises regards progress -- should one freedom find their own blossoming flower ? divorce italian style offers well-written genuine comedy deliberate intentions audience ponder regarding society social restrictions govern unhappy . cast marvelous job portraying different characters . example , daniela rocca illustration rosalia provides authentic view woman who seeks love form her husband , but not receive it . addition , marcello mastroianni brilliant job through his dual performance film also fellini la dolce vita , which shown film . however , mastroianni visual persona suggests his infatuation beautiful women explored if one views la dolce vita . lastly , camera work , mise-en-scene , framing each scene enhance complete ideas , they transcends expectations film	1
" joy luck club , " my opinion close perfect movie i ever seen . i would not hesitate give it ten stars out possible ten . mostly chinese american cast absolutely superb their performances . my favorite character june , daughter suyuan . beginning movie , her friends family gathered together before she go china meet two sisters she not realize she until after her mother died . movie centers around four chinese women their daughters . experiences women china , apparently two world wars , often filled sorrow suffering . their stories told chinese english subtitles . experiences women china young girls young women strongly influenced how each them raised their daughters united states . i only couple quibbles this otherwise outstanding movie . one women , young females china during 1930 , occasionally unusually bold asserting themselves men who oppress them . while , feminist very strong believer completely equal rights based gender , i generally applaud most their actions , it not seem historically realistic given unfortunate pervasive second class citizenship chinese women during time period . " joy luck " great film all respects , peformances actresses , general storyline , cinematography music . this movie i watch over again , enjoying very much each occasion . ending this movie when june meets her two sisters , apparently shanghai , great scene very moving , one best endings any movie i ever seen .	1

i saw this show live when it taped boston , i honestly say dane cook never ceases amaze me . it easy categorize his act simply catering towards obnoxious frat boys , but dane cook brought life back comedy his unique approach brilliant use words . not mention his delivery always spot . i grown tired typical simplistic humor sort become norm snl other " comedy " shows . but dane cook performances refreshing watch because he makes act what it ; only he could perform his act pull it off without looking like he trying too hard . he simply amazing comedian there reason why he named one time top 100 most influential people also one forbes ' top 100 celebrities . this dvd definitely worth buy . he uses his classic material previously released cd ( which never loses its hilariousness ) , but he also busts out lot new stuff just good , if not better . so buy dvd , see it theaters 11/27/06 if you , prepare yourself non-stop laughs . support guy because he awesome he adores his fans ! sufi !!	1
call me crazy ( most , anyway ) , but i absolutely adore this series . first your classic adventure flick , course , all romance , action comedy entails . second , my personal favorite , delves much further into story cranks up character development practically every major character ( i even cried imhotep one point . yeah ... you don't want get me started subject ) . since i'm such sucker sort thing , you bet i captivated . scorpion king , while not exactly mind-blowing , cool backstory previously sketchy character pure actiony fun . plus , mathayus kicks butt high style . :d box set itself really quite durable , though it might not look it first glance . interesting choice , making it out cardboard like , but it works nicely . extras such , i love running through these . fascinated ancient country early childhood , egyptology lessons nothing i didn't already know , but they make me grin all same . all all , there some lovely goodies this set , especially music videos tmr sk . mind you , i already own lot them vhs ( despite fact they're state my grandmother while i'm college ) , but we all know what happens those things after so many viewings . so yeah , i didn't think getting one my favorite series price one new release such bad thing . ps : guys , particularly brendan oded , great eye candy . rock arnold add their own flavor " hot , " too , which nothing complain this female . purely superficial thought , i know , not something i generally pay too much attention ... but frankly , it true	1
i sceptic most before seeing this movie . personally , i would rather watched funny flick . but once i saw first monster it started rocking my socks . plot line stray away but yet not too far original computer game . i would say this movie " based " game doom but not reenactment . most people probably expecting movie rekindle old memories computer game . one part movie makes you think actually game . but overall heads up , you disappointed . me i loved this movie just because action fight scenes . it really thrilled me . if you really don't care see game based movie least watch this one it sheer action . also , it makes you kind think ... would you turn into monster if you movie ? would you kill innocent people infected even if they could saved ? hahaha movie makes you think it cool aspect ! =p extras dvd aren't half bad either if you get two disc edition .	1
pee wee herman definitely character you weird like , i love it ! paul reubens really underrated actor . i don't think pee wee would successful it if it someone else besides paul playing role . there so many great moments this movie . lot jokes made this film different meanings which only adds film . this movie put simply weird , but we expect no less great mind direction paul . tim burton . danny elfman score film really set mood well . you love this movie if you haven't seen it , it great see again pee wee fans like myself who haven't seen it years !	1

this outstanding movie -- probably one best all time -- who cares if that because screenplay adapted even better book ? aren't movies usually disappointing compared book when it bookworm doing review ? movie what reviewed here . imho , reviews based " book better " should automatically deleted . said , don't miss cliff robertson outstanding performance this heart-wrenching tale mentally challenged adult who overcomes his disability receiving experimental surgery , only disappointed outcome , both ways already spoiled others here other ways i not spoil myself . it classic tale best elements theatre . if it helps understand , this movie would just outstanding if it filmed version cliff robertson stage play . i assure you if you're mature like insightful movies , you'll enjoy this movie . i don't know how good book , because i haven't read it , but this movie review	1
i never seen mr. show hbo before i got dvds they came out . like previous seasons , this one mix good bad stuff , lot more good than bad . there tight , smart pieces like prenatal beauty pageant life-raft talk show , but then there dragging , corny sketches like " date queen " . it evident commentary even bob , david , rest cast feel there some real clunkers just didn't work . other hand , bob often critical sketches work just fine , so maybe he just crack . there nice expansion cast this season . tom kenny doesn't show up much , but b.j. porter scott aukerman some hilarious roles . jay johnston also more prominent , he always funny . if you liked previous three seasons , this definitely worth picking up . writing , performing , production values best all mr. show seasons	1

i wonder if it says anything significant me i waited 10 years see this particular blockbuster . i mean , i always figured i'd get around this film some point , so i'm not total cinema snob distainer all things commercial . those clips white house getting zapped pretty attention grabbing back when i first saw previews back day . or just seeing those megalith space ships hovering over every major city world pretty darn ominous . so deep down , i always wanted check it out . but i guess i just never much rush . now critical analysis sorta my game , amazon reviewer notes above , independence day mostly pure fun movie -- not one many people going subject intense critical scrutiny . so why bother review it all ? this point , it available so many different formats probably all most consumers want know which right one them their player . they already know whether they want purchase it or not . reviewing film film may virtually pointless when most consumers likely only looking product review this point . well , what i say ? i'm critical analysis kind guy , so i really can't tell you merits digipak over double or single disk anniversary versions . tell you truth , i watched thing plain ol ' vhs -- i picked up sale , no less . but i still liked it , even without all dvd bells whistles . , yes , visuals stunning even this antiquated format . but just apercu or two . watching any film which iconic american buildings get zapped sky no longer innocent escapism it 1995 . i even winced seeing twin towers standing tall ( unharmed ) some early , pre-catastrophe scenes . we watch such things more jaded eye these days . or it more horrified stare ? escapist fare usually centered around big " what if . " these days , we pretty much know " what if . " before seeing this movie , i always wondered how well bill pullman ( actor i genuinely like ) would pull off presidential . he little too young ? little too callow ? cleverly enough , screenwriters made him struggling , almost failing commander chief , whose prior life hero pilot first gulf war may gotten him electec but left him ill prepared hardball politics . he presidential youthful john . kennedy/bill clinton kind way . unlike them , however , he not much political pro all . but also unlike kennedy , he still young able enough enter into actual battle once again himself -- ( many would opine)unlike clinton , he guts so . that something blockbuster films like play , isn't it -- our almost innate , primitive desire our leaders actual heroes ? course , we're just ( post-)modern enough want those heroes little bit flawed , say nothing bit conflicted . pullman all more . but there never any doubt he won't pull off his counter-offensive . he got cute newly motherless little tyke ( one who later showed up chicago hope ) take care , so he cannot allow himself fail . neither crazy crop-dusting pilot randy quaid , whose very family pretty much written him off loco loser . somehow quaid able inject some humanity some wit into his stock loser-who's-gonna-show-'em role . but still , there times when you find yourself mouthing his lines him wondering just how he pulled this off straight face . which you could also say rest cast well . these mostly very good , widely respected actors their work cut out them if they want move their characters all beyond level stereotype . funny thing , most them . mary mcdonnell suffers dies admirably . margaret colin stunning sassy presidential aide . her performance good enough you wonder why she never became " then next big thing " after all , i say this utter conviction , even though i must admit same time , i still keep mixing her up elizabeth perkins . face almost certain annihilation , she decides put aside her feud ( still devoted ) ex-hubby jeff goldblum . good thing too , since it goldblum character who figured out alien invaders weak spot . now all he needs ear president ... but how ? but how ? wait minute , i know ...! ok , so it bit cliched . but tongue cheek way , you understand . beauty latter-day sci-fi flicks their dazzling special effects so overwhelming you really don't want bothered much else . independence day , like so many other s-f films , wants come across 50s flick killer effects enough sly self-awareness so not appear hopelessly cornball . yeah , it just cornball enough . yeah , danged if it doesn't all work somehow .	1

they say you either love or hate this rather bizarre offering 1983 , but i found myself somewhat indifferent videodrome approached its conclusion . my mind , final third story ultimately too haphazard , esoteric , too consciously horror-driven clearly express themes worked into heart film . it easy read lot into this film , but that much credit viewer it filmmakers . still , videodrome certainly fascinating , unique film compels viewer contrast interplay video real life our increasingly technological age . 1983 , most people already seeing life through television screen - tv defined news , fashion , latest fads , etc . movie , tv plays integral part food comfort rehabilitation homeless taken cathode ray mission run dr. o'blivion ( jack creley ) . rather than paint television soul-draining maker brain-dead zombies , videodrome forges its way down even more frightening path , where television used potential weapon masses . james woods plays max renn , rather sleazy cable operator who depends shocking television shows keep his little station up running . he discovers many his shows through satellite piracy , just how videodrome first comes his attention . he fascinated show , which features nothing but torture abuse individuals , especially women , no sign plot anywhere behind it . it just kind shocking new thing he after , so he begins searching its source . his prurient interest such violent material enhanced his current girlfriend , nicki brand ( deborah harry ) , who so into sm she vows audition videodrome herself . before long , max begins hallucinating , his efforts discover source videodrome become , same time , desperate attempt maintain his sanity if not physical life . show isn't rotting his brain , but it physically changing it , therein lies unheralded danger this example reality tv taken extreme . all this works beautifully first hour , but i just feel psychology story ultimately sacrificed name horror , special effects force something disconnect viewer film . least my case , this robbed this otherwise perversely fascinating film much its power	1

if you fan kurosawa ( i am ) , then avoid this film all costs , there nothing more depressing than seeing once-great director , who revolutionized filmmaking examined powerful human themes , reduced making sentimental nonsense like " madadayo . " what monumental waste time this -- so unrealistically sentimental make one wince times . use near amateurs minor roles not help . this story ( such it ) retired teacher whose former students ( who all happen live nearby , apparently ) remain devoted him , sort christ-and-his-disciples relationship . they visit frequently , build him new home after war , hold lavish birthday parties him ( spend 30 minutes screen time helping him look his lost cat ) . what makes these students so devoted never explored all -- kurosawa just expects us take it fact . this leads painful conclusion " madadayo " depicts kurosawa idealization himself : kind old man inspiring continuing devotion his former proteges . " madadayo " also explains why beat takeshi others new generation talented japanese filmmakers become so disgusted kurosawa toward end his career . -- mellowmonk.co	-1

i intending see this documentary pretty much time it first came out until recently when i finally see it . i both pleased surprised it completely restricted itself analysis images appeared onscreen disappointed end not much really said any depth . so , i odd state relieved it not bad film like it chance ( delving into speculations sex lives famous hollywood personalities ) but it wasn't quite good i hope it would . i wondered beforehand if film would cover such topics frequent speculation cary grant randolph scott ( which there amazingly little evidence ; basis their lovers seems rest almost exclusively their roomed together many years ); rivalries cole porter set hollywood noel coward set ; efforts hide bi- , homo- , or pansexuality actors such errol flynn , robert taylor , laurence olivier , danny kaye , tyrone power ( all whom fact one three ); or proclivities various actresses . fact , there astonishingly little comment sexual orientations various people hollywood . instead , entire film deals almost exclusively images screen only screen . this , however , turns out far more interesting than voyeuristic plumbing sex lives stars . movie buff i , course , seen number obviously gay characters movies . joel cairo maltese falcon merely one better known . documentary its finest when it unearths many gay lesbian images films twenties , thirties , forties , fifties , decades which self-censorship limited what could shown movies . some these images familiar anyone who seen many films , such mrs. danvers rebecca ( those it should pointed out even it movie tremendously mutes lesbianism far more blatant novel ) . many others far less familiar . number scenes unmistakable homosexual scenes , i believe , surprise most people who seen lot movies . most interesting moment may when gore vidal admits he william wyler decided ben-hur messala lovers . stephen boyd informed this he acted his half relationship this mind , while wyler vidal decided not tell rather conservative heston any this . end , limiting discussion homosexuality images screen somewhat limited scope documentary . i'm not quite sure what ultimate point they trying make , unless it somewhat trivial one gays treated negatively movies , though improved somewhat recent years . not knowing what their ultimate goal film , i can't say whether they achieved it . still , despite ambiguity heart film what they trying accomplish , this remains very interesting film . it narrated lily tomlin . time its first presentation hbo story widely circulated she informally agreed come out closet time film first shown . last minute she seems change heart . she remains this day most poorly closeted person united states . me this points perhaps even more interesting story : way actors actresses directors stayed closeted over decades . every rupert everett ian mckellan there forty actors stay closeted . ongoing struggle maintaining public image while living very different life privately one i find fascinating . all all , this very good documentary . i definitely recommend it	1

i generally like some these french-comic-books-turned-into-movies because they're usually pretty erotic . jane fonda role barbarella comes mind . this gwendoline series definitely potential what scantily-clad women-in-bondage theme scenes involving gwendoline her dominant girlfriend . but very beautiful tawney kitaen ( cast gwendoline ) apparently balked doing girl/girl scenes ( this 1984 , after all ) , so producers obligingly didn't force her any , result this one turned into very bland , weak , diluted version raiders lost ark . it not good adventure film , it certainly not erotic . there little nudity , some ridiculous moments supposed capture kinkiness french comics , but overall this one disappointing bust .	-1

i just watched this movie last night . i came across title someone myspace jared leto fan i wanted watch it . i also read few reviews talked some people who said film riveting . riveting very least i say this film . it amazon editorial review puts it , " tour through hell . " this film makes you think . fact all addicts succumbed their addictions seems little out there me but i keep wondering it so far fetched . . . ? how many people there actually escape addictions ? you might escape one but more than likely you soon replace it . during film i kept trying see positive side it all hoping there some middle ground ; some little piece hope left . i wrong . film didn't depict drug use way i expected see it ; way i seen it depicted countless other films . all ugly aspects drug use put out there your viewing pleasure . personally i found it painful watch . there moments when i actually thought turning it off but some reason continued watch . i think reason hypnotic trancelike style film . truth i couldn't stop watching . film put me directly shoes addict . i felt like addicts film . . . my hands sweaty my heart pounding . i couldn't close my eyes . i want see it again sometime . i would like watch it my husband . i bought movie before i ever watched it first time . film painfully realistic , genuinely graphic , appalling appealing same exact time . must see . overall i think it wonderful film add any collection . personally it probably one best movies i ever watched . i think acting movie outstanding , direction genius , plot amazingly horrific . all all this 5 star film	1
remaking classic thankless undertaking , but peter jackson crafted film stands shoulder shoulder original . although he rarely mentions other films kong history , jackson taken elements not only 1933 original , but also delaurentiis remake , son kong , even king kong escapes forge epic film giant ape woman he loves . it these later films informs jackson take love story , human object gorilla affections comes love monster well . course this also brings " beauty beast " theme full circle , makes film ending even more tragic . many uninformed critics labelled this movie " jurrassic kong , " but clearly they not familiar amout dinosaurs populate original film . now expanded edition features even more prehistoric action sequences they real treat , particularly " log raft " sequence . this new edition well worth time expense , kong mini-statue cool bonus - get it now	1

this dvd first season now-classic simpsons animated series , collects show first thirteen episodes . not much really needs said simpsons , it one biggest pop culture icons ever . however , you really tell these episodes series rough around edges when it started . character designs unrefined , animation crude rubbery . stories feel like typical sitcom plots little simpsons edginess zany humour tossed , but not nearly enough it . voice-actors also still getting into character here , so their performances also different what they later matured into . luckily , fox loaded first season dvd goodies , including commentaries every episode some other fun retrospective material . presentation really nice too some original packaging disc artwork . i'd say episodes themselves three stars , but superb box set treatment bumps overall score up four . if you're casual simpsons fan , season 2 much better place start watching , thats when memorable episodes really start coming . but hardcores , this set great buy , nice start your collection .	1

i can't possibly put into words how great war movie this , but it touched me deep inside . me , there little greater honor than serve one country , especially time unpopular war . i felt his film portrayed desire world warriors answer call duty honorable men , regardless side you fighting . perhaps one my favorite things this movie . albeit small part , time given " other " side we allowed glimpse enemy warriors . end , lt . col . moore paid homage , sense , enemy he fought . , course , actual footage moore shown extras ( bonuses must see ! ) praising his men -- nearly weeping he so . time when only reason people join service college money , servicemen scramble get out service when war comes , this movie reminds us we should much more grateful few serve dignity it because they americans love their country enough answer call when it comes . without these honorable warriors , there would no america	1
appreciate this story , you believe two people meet quickly fall forever into forbidden love . what heart this film . if you can't accept premise , movie simply not work . what makes it throb life me excellent performances jeremy northam jennifer ehle whose mutual passion sweeps us . paltrow eckhart secondary love story here , but you never feel they really care one . worth your time if you romantic . ok , i'm romantic . sue me	1
whatever ills world , it all fault corporations . that basic premise this terribly misguided one-sided totally non-objective movie . example , instead saying how terrible it companies paying people developing world peanuts their work , they forget these people alternatives even worse that why they took job first place ! these jobs provide them one few options they , if they chose job freely , it must their best option , no matter how crazy it seems us . people skills rise , opportunities increase over time ( more corporations not less , create more competition these people labor ) , country becomes wealthier , these people wages rise automaticaly fact , wages whole country average . there no shortcuts his . famous story comes nepal where anti-child labor laws , urging un , turned thousands kids overnight into prostitutes those jobs , sad it may , their best options avoid starvation feed their families . it slow process , but all industrialized nations went through process . government-mandated " shortcuts " usually produce results which even worse . however , results speak themselves : very short period time , example , hundrds millions people lifted out poverty china , india around world thanks " evil " capalism its corporations . no other system ever it so quickly past 15 years china india alone . also , cost living very low there , so these pennies really go long way , don't measure it cost living west . what filmmakers alternative they offer these people ? i guess let people starve death , then makers this movie don't anyting complain !? other examples stupidity include showing company like person who psychopath . corpoartion legal entity yes , may act like separate " " far law concerned , but corporation nose , feet , stomach ? it eat apples or sneeze or arthritis ? course , not , than how you attach human idea like psychopath it ?? several main " spokepersons " movie , chomsky , michael moore , rifkin others renowned their off-the-wall comments which frequently no basis any kind economics or reality . correct inaccuracies statements made these other people movie , you'd stop it every 5 minutes explain audience how profoundly wrong statements . throughout whole movie , you're basically bombarded one-sided arguments very little other side presented , despite director claim opposite 9they claim 1/2 1/2 , it more like 80%-20%) . just look chomsky comments how consumers so stupid , they don't realize all things they buy they don't really need . i mean we don't need fashionable clothes ( hey , let all dress boring chomsky ! ) , dvd players , or any new gadgets make life easier or more fun . who judge what you really need ? chomsky , course . he final arbiter what you really need or what you don't . you're too stupid know what you want , according him . he says you should " more important things " , like ... perhaps studying lingistics ( which he teaches but which very few care ) . movie make some correct good observations , especially regarding polution , however , i'd say 80% movie factually logically flawed . it also full economic fallacies . it worth watching i guess , just see how many errors one make just 1 movie . despite all ranting movie , it fails mention biggest reason most problems it brings up - too much governement interference every facet life . examples , how could government brazil forbit people collecting rain water ! how could u.s. government so many things private companies public funds ? just forbid governments playing favorites companies , forbid government corporate welfare any kind , forbid subsidies companies , cut suffocating red tape regulation ( esp . developing countries but west too ) , cut corporate taxes 5 or 10% ( see unemployment rate go almost nothing , give people all around world better life , increase competition , etc . ) if these other governments ( not corporations ' ) problems eliminated , vast majority all problems which movie brings up simply go away . interesing film anyone see how truth twisted mindless people agenda go back 15th century rural lifestile ( spoken much admiration ) , people no understanding economics , how world really works how really raise billions out poverty who this movie biggest disservice .	-1
worst movie ever made . i actually sat through whole thing hoping it would get better . acting beyond awful , story joke . i honestly blown away how terrible it , not waste your money or time this movie	-1

i huge fan . . montgomery work since i eleven-year old girl living caribbean . i've read re-read , re-read her stories again again , can't seem get enough . first two film installments anne green gables story warm , beautiful , funny , inspiring moving pieces work , more or less faithful montgomery original novels . third installment travesty . anachronism , bad dialogue , bad plot plain old bad acting plague this " sequel " . i say " sequel " quotes , because thing i dislike most movie fact storyline complete departure what montgomery envisioned anne so long ago . what way end i t.t hat said , i've decided purchase only first two installments , leave third alone . i prefer anne gilbert live out their literary lives my imagination , than poison my memory them drivel anne green gables : continuing story	-1
you'll get over it great film . film boy named vincent who everything going him riding smoothly . he great swimmer well school , people like him . vincent girlfriend noemie who very good him best pal stephane who also swim team . vincent however secretly dating bruno ( older man ) make excuses see bruno . while hanging out hallway his friends , vincent eye catches benjamin , new student . two lock eyes next time they cross paths again when vincent working . however , other people vincent swim team know benjamin gay they tell him stay away vincent . next day vincent outed graffiti school wall . film then vincent trying cope growing up now everyone school knows he gay . he come forth his girlfriend , his best friend , his family . i think story line extremely believable . it almost if you forget its movie if your looking into someone else life . it so powerful see what vincent going through new struggles he faces . julien baumgartner such good actor , he delivers great performance . he very intune character he playing able make vincent so dynamic so many emotions feelings . rest cast also good , roles they play vital film . i just can't tell you words how much i liked this film . i don't know if it because it french film . it definately artistic side you may not see so much american films . i also didn't mind reading subtitles , but rather enjoyed them . this film probably one best gay films i seen . i strongly think if you watch this you like it	1

i saw charlie chocolate factory last night first time ( i'm behind times , yes ) though i usually don't care very much giving my opinion , journey tim burton his team made me cross deserves homage . especially all criticism rising around film before it released . i tim burton fan more than decade now ; i grew up his films . but what i through yesterday his really unique . i actually never thought he would offer us such film one day . fans his first period , all lonely desperate characters won't like it sure . since mars attacks !, more specifically since big fish , burton decided tell things differently . his vision world slightly changed every his films : now , rejected freak comes down world stays . world remains frightening weird even thought we call it " reality " but world worth living . that what charlie chocolate factory all ... it all begins main title sequence may one main weaknesses film . sequence very entertaining visually ambitious but they decided go cgi it looks like it decision they made last minute . since film proudly made " real " sets , " real " oompas loompas , " real " squirrels , main title looks inappropriate . it not important but it tim burton film we know how much he usually works his main title . hopefully , danny elfman there crazy mix edward scissorhands spider-man ( music when title film appears gave me shivers ) , true musical roller-coaster gives hint what his score sound like through film . after , it just emotions . all kinds them : laughs ( many - audience laughed almost every thirty seconds ) , tears joy ( we all know charlie gonna find ticket but when he , you just can't refrain your heart beat faster ) , mercy ( way burton depicts social misery bucket family really touching ) , amazement ( wonka factory its many rooms true wonder , one most achieved design burton ever offered us ) many mores . very much like book , even though it seems simple childish , you would like stop second collect those feelings try analyze them but you don't time . it just never stops ( i realize it might flaw some people fact ) . burton never so generous terms human warmness . johnny depp proposes inventive completely wacky interpretation here . i won't compare gene wilder since i don't know first film very well ( pretty unknown flick here europe ) those comparisons should stop anyway . depp makes wonka tormented unadapted character who doesn't know much common courtesy doesn't really care anyway . he built up his own universe response his authoritarian father he pretty proud it . he just doesn't want those " weird " ( word he likes - you've all seen tv spots ) boring parents their despicable children ruin what life based . yet ... so depp wonka actually very moving pathetic his attempts entertain his visitors . burton everything he make you hate augustus , vercua , violet mike moment you first see them , you get instantly closer wonka when you noticed he feels same . addition , john august vision wonka past ( including always perfect cameo christopher lee ) offers character real depth you didn't expect . danny elfman also one main attractions film . while his score already classic burton/elfman work some interesting experiments ( main themes splendid ) , songs he wrote oompas loompas just so funny . hugh laughs audience some musical choices . those songs don't intend stay you months ( it would hard they're based dahl lyrics doesn't allow broadway impulses ) , they're just off-beat numbers playing many references so many styles . oingo boingo fans buy soundtrack when it'll come out , it'll bring them back 15 years ago . what , i tell you more ? mcdowell sets amazing , pescucci work impressive well rousselot beautiful cinematography . some oscar nominations should fall here . ending , without revealing it , august additions really touching fit perfectly burton new approach . even though final shot tempers " family " theme he developed through film ( it still burton , not disney ) , burton makes you feel good because he feels good ( what i'm writing here ring bell when you'll see movie ) . i don't know you but after so many distressed pessimistic films , it really moved see he found certain peace . charlie chocolate factory step forward direction he gave his career big fish . he lost his father , he became one , he getting older all those questions doubts expressed many important very complex images scenes he imagined film . that why i could call this film " edward scissorhands " his new period . those films very different but gave me both some very essential emotions . thank you , tim burton . thank you very much	1

this movie put josh hartnett acting map me . his earlier works easy enough avoid consider yourself lucky if you've able so . i hope this transition his part into better roles ; he entertaining . his quick-witted quips keep you laughing help you avoid need wonder what earth going movie . they fill you due time , even though i wouldn't surprised if you figure out ending before it unfolds ; you wouldn't first . it seemed little silly morgan freeman ben kingsley roles such these since they relatively small roles . but they definitely added big names draw attention movie more people should see . i feel like i should more say this movie , but i really sum it up saying i thoroughly enjoyed lucky # slevin .	1
no matter how old i get , i'll never too old enjoy good teen movie . yes , it rather formulaic , but 10 things i hate you smart funny more intelligent than your average teen comedy . it also stars julia styles , which definite plus my book . i can't say my high school anything like padua high ( how many high schools take place huge castle ? ) , i certainly never english teacher like one teaching here , but every high school pretty much same when it comes cliques , romances , misunderstandings , sibling rivalries , like . one things i really liked this film fact it didn't break down according overused formula rich kids vs . poor kids never twain shall meet ( unless you're , say , molly ringwald ) . it true this film loosely inspired shakespeare taming shrew , but don't make too much . how many teens would even know what shrew ? personally , i don't look kat stratford ( julia styles ) shrew ; she just bitter , disillusioned teen who can't stand thought doing what expected her - she reasons taking this persona . her sister bianca ( larisa oleynik ) her exact opposite , vivacious girl who just wants normal teenager . her problem girls ' overprotective father , who refuses let bianca date until kat starts dating ( which doesn't look like it happening any time soon given kat nature ) . new kid school , cameron ( joseph gordon-levitt ) , smitten bianca , he puts together plan make her date-eligible someone else take out her sister - ingeniously using school pitifully shallow cool guy ( bianca admirer ) middle man . chosen one school mysterious new tough guy , who earn money he paid win reluctant kat over . obviously , he ends up falling girl , which puts everything place predictable conclusion . kat designated dater become couple , or everything explode guy face ? bianca ever win right get out house spread her perkiness all around ? who bianca choose - hot , brainless mr. cool or cameron , nice boy who looks like he should still junior high ? , since she already taller than guy , bianca ever stop putting her hair up when she goes out him ? clichs abound , but script really rather witty . those keeping score home , film feature one wild dance party required minimum one barfing scene , but it never crosses line into completely dumb teen comedy . 10 things i hate you isn't quite good classic john hughes films 1980s , but it easily better than most teen films produced recent years . its pg-13 rating , it also teen movie suitable teens all ages - little table dancing racy this one gets	1

captioning valuable service provide those us who need it . film quot ; mirandaquot ; there no english closed-captioning track , only concession captions all track spanish . i noticed british efforts frequently released without captions , quot ; mirandaquot ; there usual modern faults : nearly inaudible whispering , inadequate separation dramatic lines accompanying music , british terms pronounciations which americans need hear more accurately , so forth . use spanish subtitles not help whatever these matters . otherwise , i believe christina ricci suitably admired photographer	-1

sitting down watch this film hige smile came across my face just ten minutes because once kevin klines charactor outed his now famous student kamden ( dillon ) movie doesn't let up . i haven't seen movie kept me laughing so much very long time . kevin kline plays english lit professor who , i mentioned , get outed his former student while accepting oscar playing gay charactor so heat moment decided dedicate award his professor " he gay " point ... hilarity ensues . you see , kevin kline engaged emily ( joan cusack scene stealing performance ) they due married just two days ... so those two days he needs figure out if he really gay . one surprising thing tom sellick who doesn't even look same without his mustache ( he actually much better looking should keep it off ) tom plays reporter who intent getting kevin out himself , admitt himself he really gay , all while poor emily isn't sure if there even going wedding . movie great start finish it touch some deeper subjects line gay tollerance acceptance our society . when kamden outs his professor you get irritated when priciple ( played perfectly bob newhart !!! ) warns him if he doesn't get married he'll lose his job . it sad see way our society treat something they don't agree . all all this ( tagline states ) out out comedy , out out good time	1
me , this film matt damon , brilliant newcomer who came out ( seemingly ) nowhere . i floored his performance - one best 20th century . course he supported fine cast - robin williams , ben affleck , loveable minnie driver , whose onscreen chemistry damon sizzling . matt emerald heap cheap diamonds , obviously multi-talented guy - he co-wrote screenplay well starred it . well worth seeing .	1

bottle rocket not movie you're going like . trust me , you'll probably hate it . it comedy not over top funny , it very very subtle . it basically just wes anderson movie . owen wilson wannabe criminal who plans get local mob boss , his former employer , notice him his friends pulling off heist bookstore . they go lam hide out motel before circumstances send them back home . funniest lines aren't likely ones you'll notice first time through . talking tipping help motel , why they wear white tape their noses when pulling off bookstore job , bob mapplethorpe description why he should gang , dignan explaining why they didn't rob his mom home ... it subtle incredibly funny . this comic treat movie , but it one most people aren't going like first time through , unless you've already familiarized yourself other wes anderson flicks like rushmore royal tenenbaums . it certainly not my favorite movie , but it really good stuff . " she says you're like piece garbage ... it sounds better spanish .	1

this film you either get or you don't , i think zach braff great job his first film he wrote directed he managed leave indelible mark . characters great i felt like i could relate them ( or maybe not ) there some realy great scenes it . andrew largeman ( zach braff ) blamed his father ( ian holm ) freak accident which left his mother paraplegic , leaving his hometown new jersey large isolates himself world drifts los angeles working actor . when he hears his mother death however he forced return ' garden state ' reconsider his own life . way he meets alot his old friends sam ( natalie portman ) whom they both start relationship starts changing his life , there also some other wierd quirky characters like cop guy works hardware store . this very good film i'm glad i watched it cause i thought it would end up boring but it isn't i highly recommend this excellent drama/comedy film .	1
we went family theater see " charlie chocolate factory " . involvement tim burton johnny depp , need see treatment roald dahl classic children book got me interested . we ' 70s musical version gene wilder vhs . it ok but didn't quite capture dahl magic . this version less traditional musical all numbers featured oompa-loompas takeoffs big production numbers other movie musicals . i guess much could expected danny elfman , who music simpsons other burton movies ( including amazing " nightmare before christmas " ) . elfman also all oompa-loompa singing vocals . burton brings back story oompa-loompas willie wonka , while depp bring his own bizarre interpretation wonka role . it good followup his turn pirate jack sparrow " pirates caribbean . " other four kids who find golden tickets right mark -- gluttonous gloop , greedy veruca , vain veronica , smart-ass mike -- all get their just desserts , so speak . special mention also go deep roy ( indian actor , i assume -- how deep depp same movie ) who magic digital technology , plays all oompa-loompas , including one who wonka psychologist , young actor who plays good-hearted charlie title . squirrels also play important digitally-enhanced role . overall , this movie might little strange ( especially squirrels ) very small children , but good family fare its own style .	1

tyrone power not swashbuckler par errol flynn but this still decent movie genre . maureen o'hara helps out lot respect . power plays pirate captain caribbean who prays upon spanish shipping . he one infamous henry morgan lieutenants . show opens , morgan sent england stand trial piracy power captured spanish . he contemplating giving up pirate lifestyle but point becomes moot when he captured spanish . he showing defiance spanish governor suffering rack when rest pirates show up rescue him . victorious pirates their vengeance upon hapless cowardly spaniards when captain morgan shows up stops them . much everyone surprise , he pardoned king appointed new governor jamaica under theory he would most effective rooting out pirates . england now peace spain two want suppress freelance " free trade " . captain morgan hard position . he not trusted upper crust island neither he trusted all his old subordinates who determined continue their piratical ways . tyrone power one those trusted capt . morgan determined help him but his mind preoccupied . he love daughter former governor ( o'hara ) but she holds him contempt . finally , order secure all his aims , he goes " undercover " poses relapsed pirate . swashbuckler tradition , everything turns up roses after few swordfights broadsides . this not great movie but it enjoyable . still , i like flynn better .	1

... you . this film compared " logan run " , " matrix " , " coma " , name few , but it most strongly resembles 1979 movie " parts : clonus horror " , probably most widely screened viewers movie mock-a-thon " mystery science theater 3000 " . sitting through " island " , i kept thinking myself " boy , this looks familiar . " fact , " island " almost complete , play-by-play clone ( ba da ching ! ) " parts " , right down outfits worn clones . there currently lawsuit against bay brought makers " parts " , which should open-and-shut case . this film set futuristic clone colonie , where wealthy influential pay top dollar keep copies themselves available spare parts . clones kept docile dark facility employees , not allowed leave until they selected go almost mythical paradise ( island ) . course , clones allegedly going island actually euthanized their organs , their patrons gotten sick . movie focuses male clone who questions his environment eventually brings down enterprise . ewan mcgregor satisfactory this role , his acting reasonably good despite bland dialouge . his female counterpart , scarlet johansen , pure eye candy , mediocre actress who happens knockout blonde but leaves you wondering if she would get lead ( or even major part ) college play ( best performance turned sean bean , evil scientistï¿½ . ) there plenty action viewer chew , making entertaining enough popcorn movie , but it not only nothing special , it nothing original . maybe worth rental , but not much more	-1
kind me , go mark down horribly pretentious review unite : 02 . texh something demands interpretation , taken face value , it nothing . it noted all characters types , way , representing aspect human psyche . if you want interpret negative( ?, might actually positive or ambivalent ) conclusion end , it result fact every particular character incomplete . ichise f*cking stupid . he animal drive , which why powerless ran takes him . some episode , ichise remarks avoid ran prognostication(you destroy everything , you all alone end ) , he must take sophistication . civilization , rise above animal nature core his person . he remarks ran 25 , or 26 , he rushes back lux , since he met ran , he changed . before , whenever he met difficulty , he would critics texh claimed : " punch punch ! " episode 26 makes its response : ichise hasn't changed least . when onishi ordered ran kill her , ravaging mobs lux obliterates onishi , leaving only lumps texhnolyze his legs , ichise breaks into his signature rage . it references first episode : we cut flashback ichise living pit fighter . he punches mob , crushing their skulls , cheers crowd long since dead . blood pours floor rainlike torrent , staccato bullet fire . someone shoots his arm , severing control nerves . this extent his change : least he , accept his new body . he accepts his new arm , accepts his new leg . doc ghost high , returns her lab reactivates his texhnolyze . ichise , once more capable , slaughters mob . ichise , now without direction , searches nothing but ran . he heads opera house , seek kano find direction he not , himself . he meets kohakura his way up , sees rooted bodies shapes , unable kill , reduced staring their reality until end time . he meets kano . kano goes off long rant , how he never wanted go surface world first place : apparently , class manuevered their descent into lux , vast population guinea pigs . one doesn't know if gabe indigenous , or brought down class . this all method , it possible speculate kano raped ran . world texhnolyze , semen man apparently virulent poison times . yoshii killed hooker second volume coming her . his life energy overwhelmed woman , who only wishes live , who deprived any hope . here , kano might driven ran insane raping her . here , abortion murder : ran may ordered onishi abort pregnancy killing her . ichise , seeing ran corpsehead , attached obviously useless shape lifesupport unit , freaks out . he rages kano , ignorant . he punches kano head off . end , he resigned his fate . he badly wounded , probably die . he all alone end , after all . he can't allowed talk shapes rooted ground , steal their battery packs ensure their mobility . onishi arch conservative , other reviewer said his organization . he really can't effect any change , he cannot create future himself , organ , or lux(lukuss very funny , i'm told japanese version transliterates directly ruku9su or something . lukuss very similar lux , which : " international system unit illumination , equal one lumen per square meter . " episode 26 , kohakura uses what apparently japanese pun : lukuss ninth sphere reviving hell . http://buddhism.inbaltimore.org/threeheaps4.html ) . when you see , yoshii brutality against organ(killing onishi wife , randomly sniping organo members ) tad more understandable . texhnolyze kind onishi : when there nothing left him , when what he guarded destroyed , ran conveniently asks him kill her before screaming mob . euthanasia , am i rite ? i am tired , i am out insight . i no time interpret this any more , it would nice if you could get joycean scholar work this us . this piece extremely full symbolism , regenerative lizard first episode , train streaking through darkness , only meet dead end above , dragonfly(hmmm , what dragonfly mean japanese context ? color shapes also weird , i know japan , black mourning color , but china , white(which i find tad more appropriate ) , color death . texhnolyze , ultimately , very flawed . if symbolism not properly considered , it wholly unenjoyable . sometimes symbols may excessively trite , there some displays japanese bias(mizuho excessively stupid ) . characters , it said thousand times , obviously flat . they not completely sympathetic , because they all flawed . why they lux first place ? it , quite possibly , ninth sphere reviving hell . they all tragedies	1

great casting , dancings performance . well , if you keep abusing yourself , nobody save you . this so talented broadway genius simply couldn't himself mess up many women lives stubbornly doing harm himself , chain-smoking , addicting prescriptioned drugs , sleeping around , hopping one woman . he created so many personal disasters around himself , dedicated himself broadway musicals but never took care himself . burning his own life candle both ends day night . when curtain theatre falls , it would go up again next evening , but when curtain your life decides come down you , it won't go up again . wonderful movie hidden warning lesson those who entertaining show biz	1

director curtis hanson filmed many remarkable films : " la confidential " ( 1997 ) his most awarded film , " 8 mile " ( 2002 ) very good movie " her shoes " ( 2005 ) very successful incursion " family conflict " genre movie . " hand rock cradle " ( 1992 ) dramatic thriller full adrenalin . may some viewers plot quite predictable ... well it wasn't me ! i just seat edge my couch more than half movie . story follows : recently pregnant woman pays visit obstetrician discovers there new doctor there . dr. mott starts check-up ends sexual molestation claire . when she returns home she shares her anguish michael , her husband . they decide denounce dr. mott . here series dreadful events triggered : dr. mott commits suicide unable stand other patients denounces , his pregnant widow learns she broken spontaneous abort . some months later bartels enjoying their newborn michael convinces claire hire live-in nanny allowing her free time her occupations . after discarding some applicants , claire , " casually " meets " perfect nanny " : peyton flanders , who actually dr. mott widow seeking revenge . little little peyton disrupt bartels ' domestic life creating havoc amongst them , expelling gardener , arousing jealousies , emotionally separating claire her young daughter trying seduce michael . all this performed reckless duplicity . tension violence increases arriving hair-raising final scene . rebecca de mornay hideous nanny gives outstanding performance . i particularly surprised economy gestures she gives yet transmits viewer all volcanic passion her sentiments . ernie hudson mentally impaired gardener gives over par performance . last but not least robert elwit photography , especially home interiors , very good . thumbs up this movie ! reviewed max yofre .	1
... but movie pretty good . i found myself highly disappointed book , almost wasn't able finish it . characters flat , story reading like history lesson religion through ages , not true story , so i wasn't sure what make movie . i pleasantly surprised though , enjoy movie immensely . it long , but it kept pace going throughout . subtitling latin french bit mundane drudge through , but it made movie bit more ' believable ' than everyone speaking english when main character actually french . teabing played brilliantly , while hanks not who i would thought langdon , he superb job role . if you set your personal beliefs aside view movie piece exceptional fiction drama suspense , it well worth watching . murder , mystery , suspense , action , drama ... it all there this film	1

i love watch action movies . better still , i love watch robert de niro action movies ( 15 minutes , men honour , godfather ... ) . i also love watch jean reno action movies ( professional , mission impossible , wasabi ... ) imagine my surprise , when i saw both robert de niro jean reno same action movie ! ronin very interesting movie . very exciting , too . it complex theme , twisting plot well perplexing subplots , exotic settings , rising falling actions , critical but unknown object pursuit , witty dialogue , all compounded host mysterious key characters their vague relationships ( ira terrorist , russian mobsters , ex-cia ex-kgb operatives ) . what i enjoyed most this movie watching sam ( robert de niro ) assuming role strategist snatch team . strategist , he always asking clarifying questions verifying details . i am amazed his astute power observation , shown below ... just name few scenes : - scanning surroundings various angles before entering pub checking out possible escape routes ; - sensing danger spotting sniper bridge while conducting covert weapon buying exchange near bridge ; - sizing up each member snatch team , especially gregor ( stellan skarsgard playing rogue electronics expert ) intentionally pushing cup over table edge ; - reconnaissance , testing camera taking photographs unsuspectingly hotel lobby creating diversion ... ; - noticing wrong suitcase immediately after ambush/shoot out ; - spotting wall advertisement possible lead whereabout russian mafia ; even vincent ( jean reno ) demonstrates it , especially when he spots , window cafe , young girl carrying metal suitcase , while trying figure out sam exact whereabout gregor , who switched stole original suitcase earlier . power observation obviously very important character trait ronin . i understand ronin masterless samurai . lone-wolf . maverick . mercenary . apparently , movie , each member snatch team ronin . movie , there even short history lesson exploits famous 47 ronins their eventual suicide ritual known sepaku , told jean pierre ( michael lonsdale ) . [ based actual historical events , only 46 them committed sepaku . last one pardoned shogun . ] most exhilarating parts movie obviously high-octane car chases rampant shoot-outs both nice paris settings ... quiet country road , highway then through busy side streets tunnel . there even amazing scene , showing sam doing his own surgery remove bullet his stomach mirror knife . most touching scenes movie dynamic comradeship seemingly mutual respect sam vincent , despite fact each them his own agenda snatch team . final scene , - fact throughout movie ' running time - , critical but unknown object pursuit remains mystery . conclude this review , i really enjoyed watching ronin very much . once again , i also learned human ingenuity creativity very important life ( or survival ) skills , characterised movie . this addition my resource repertoire .	1

" hansel gretel " best ' movie tale ' cannon films produced . this version story taken hunperdinck opera , but its still recognizable rendition . cast fine , hugh pollard hansel , nicola stapleton gretel , david warner emily richard parents . but real treat here cloris leachman , grizelda , witch . this veteran actress simply terrific , whether coaxing children inside her gingerbread house , or threatening them death . she also sings well , something she rarely films . production tasteful , new songs , adapted opera . bit tense times young kids , " hansel gretel " nevertheless , classic !

before i bought this dvd used local store i hadn't even heard either series , much less seen them . i guess i fresh approach towards it since i didn't buy it simply because i liked series . ^_^ --- ninku movie ( more depth since no one really talked it yet ): fight scenes very well , even though no real weapons used ( i'm into sharp , pointy items shine :p ) . there lot detail used making special moves their effects . i didn't feel cheated all , even without any samurai swords . well known ninku , no one ever recognizes them ! fame fortune don't always go together they often searching ways get food money . circus performers pretend famous ninku team very town ninku arrive ! what worse , only job around imposters ' servents ! fusuke may look lot like child blank expression , but he captain first ninku division . movie , he shows himself very thoughtful , generous , loyal , level-headed guy ; what you'd expect leader . i found myself laughing him more than once during movie wondered how he could possibly former captain . i didn't any doubts once fight scene truely started . he becomes very serious vibe you get him changes . touji captain sixth division ninku . movie he seems rihoko brother . i shocked first see him tear off his clothes fight his underwear , but it became comical . aicho captain nineth division ninku . rihoko huge crush him he all he stay away her . rihoko doesn't fight , she just tags guys ( i'm pretty sure she fact touji sister ) . i think her main role comical relief occasional damsel distress , but i like her sometimes bossy character . penguin named hiroyuki . he very intelligent . unfortunely , he also tends really bad gas . poor fusuke seemingly faints when hiroyuki farts him movie . immature humor ? sure , but it still funny me . it isn't overdone or used bad taste , so i don't problem it . i'm sure it effective move fight . : poverall , it very funny , even if stupid kind way . --- yu yu hakusho : i could tell right away this movie best viewed after seeing series . i guess i lucked out store accidently gave me yu yu hakusho movie ( poltergeist report ) first accident . i got clue who who how they all felt each other . because i so new series i didn't really notice anything wrong characters or their voices , but i also confused certain things weren't explained because they assume you've watched series before movie . if you flexible let characters different than normal , then buy this used somewhere . it , far , not worth purchasing it brand new , so make sure you get it used	1

i vote no more after this one . first all , movie edited horribly . there numerous occurences where edits should tightened . acting so over top it ridiculous . mary griffith ( aimee graham ) father stereotypical demon father . we listen these kids talk camera throughout film how they live rave , so they one music how raveing druging their life ... i could only ask ... who cares ? then , kids all arrive rave . weehoo !! 45 minutes bah ! bah ! bah ! bah ! bah ! music seizure inducing strobe effects . kids so drugged up they spend most time sitting toilet . punks living beat up other kids . punks who riot create havoc no reason . drive shooting looked so fake overdramatized . gets you all teary-eyed . not because you any emotional connection any characters , but because you spent $1.50 renting movie discount day spent 80 minutes your life watching it ... well ... 72 minutes if you fast forward through credits ... 3:30 bah ! bah ! bah ! opening credits ... geez	-1
most films try capture significance sporting event by-gone era suffer because they fail attach it any historical context . upon first view , i thought " 61 * " somewhat guilty . it unfair opinion because time i just finished watching " seabiscuit " " miracle " , both which slightly superior films . now , however , i've change mind after second viewing . billy crystal enormous job capturing mm boys 1961 . crystal all bases covered ( bad pun intended ) . he covers maris ' can-do spirit he approaches babe single-season home run mark . however , crystal also covers hostility this drew press fans . barry pepper great job conveying maris ' quiet suffering anger spawned . meanwhile , maris ' friend , beloved mickey mantle also nearing ruth record , but doesn't generate such animosity . off field , however , crystal shows us mantle making changeover fun-loving young man almost self-destructing adult . around these two men , press -- specifically voracious new york press -- circles like vultures . side characters fairly well-rounded well-portrayed : specifically , anthony michael hall whitey ford . crystal fondness era evident every scene . fortunately , he doesn't wax too nostalgic . instead , he gives us honest view time when baseball barely clinging its innocence , man who not deserve hostility asterisk haunted him .	1
this unsparing , unsentimental look pro football which players alternately brutes , slaves management . coaches shamelessly manipulate players then discard them moment injury strikes ; players drugged up order coax them onto field , while same time unpopular players ensnared drug charges order trap them contract renegotiation time . " north dallas forty " probably one my favorite sports movies , definitely my favorite football movie . that because its defiant outsider approach -- " ball four " , baseball book made peter gent football novel possible , only ever wound up lame sitcom ; " north dallas forty " goes all way . even though movie based dallas cowboys 1960s , instantly dated 1970s ' filmmaking technique remains timeless ( even if it same director who made " weekend bernie " , which timeless very different reasons ) . part movie continuing appeal remains its cast . nick nolte brilliant lead , rebellious but hones t-t o-a-fault north dallas wide receiver phil elliott . phil tells it like it sees management what they , but doesn't realize he cheated out his career until third or fourth time he double-crossed owners , coaches friends alike . playing riff dandy don meredith , country singer/songwriter mac davis plays sly quarterback seth maxwell . rest football team filled out several ex-nfl players . john matuszak second acting career launched this movie , bo svenson football career should launched this movie . coaches , charles durning ( cliche-spouting offensive coordinator ) great g.d. spradlin ( playing thinly veiled tom landry ) both dominate their scenes . yes , that dabney coleman oil man part owner who delivers one movie best lines ( " you speak canadian ? " ) . dayle haddon looks great phil love interest , but otherwise gets overshadowed rest cast . she seems so disinterested phil throughout movie i convinced their relationship wouldn't make it week after story ended . kotcheff directs his football scenes interesting approach could never duplicated today : there not single wide shot packed house , not single closeup spectator north dallas face paint maxwell jersey . gone excesses modern tv football coverage , only product endorsement i could spot xylocaine . most early football action shown mute flashbacks , climactic game against chicago not joined until after two-minute warning . even such minimal football , however , kotcheff action so muddy , bloody cruel you imagine final game sequence cued up . . ' vcr fateful monday night he tangled joe theismann leg . always worth watching every late january , " north dallas forty " one those films you hope never going remade , because original everything you need football movie	1
don't make mistake i buying this copy this classic italian movie . it complete disaster faded colors grainy images . i can't beleive they put this one market . you'll get see three sketches all right , but transfer simply amateurish insulting . no subtitles , not even original italian track , no gallery photos etc . this worst dvd i ever bought . luckily others , new version released 2005 which proper treatment . i just hope visconti last movie innocent won't fall this category when they released it someday . let us pray preservation laura antonelli beauty	-1
remake classic steinbeck short novel 1939 screen gem , which starred burgess meredith lon chaney , jr. here john malkovich plays lenny , he excellent dim-witted giant who only " wants take care rabbits . " gary sinise george , lenny friend " caretaker , " i like him better than meredith same role back ' 39 . movie faithful adaptation , few minor changes : black man crooks , example , doesn't get involved george lenny scheme getting ranch " living off fat land " book . also whereas shooting lenny after he accidentally killed curley wife long drawn out ' 39 movie , here it relatively quick - though short flashback tag added no particular reason . it good production all around , certainly worth watch	1

tupac fan or not , this film affect you end . it takes you deep mental trip through this man life beginning end . yet , unlike most music documentaries , tupac narrates this film himself . using hundreds old interviews , both film also audio recordings . he tells his own story , his own way . film starts off showing journey tupac car through las vegas streets night he shot death . while you watch this song playing , one last songs he would ever . it so ironic because it talking what actually happend him night . " multiple gun shots fill block , fun stops . nigga call cops ... people shot , nobody stops . i wonder when world stopped caring last night . " tupac mother afenia , produced this film put all her heart soul into making it happen . god bless her strength so . tupac tells his story growing up poor without father lean . growing up community more drugs streets than food table . you get understand man behind music alot more . tupac like most us , angel devil rolled into one . public eye , tupac seen many thug evil man but he also same man recorded songs like " dear mama , keep your head up brenda got baby . " these songs showed his emotional side real deep concern future youth . however , tupac also got caught up angry , gangster life style rap music once he became famous . he even admitts film . " i immature my ego out control . i said alot stupid things i wish i could take back . " one most chilling scenes film first time tupac got shot five times new york recording studio 1995 . this what started east coast/west coast war rap music . film inter-cuts perfectly two stories shooting . tupac version what happend biggie smalls/puff daddy version . no , they don't match up . tupac went grave thinking they set him up night . once you see this , it up you decide yourself . all all , this fantastic documentay very talented music artist brings it you very human level .	1
aside " breakfast tiffany " " my fair lady , " audrey hepburn didn't get any better than this . hepburn plays ariane chavasse , parisian student cello who becomes enamoured rich , older american , frank flanagan , played gary cooper . flanagan seems like unlikely character return her love , however , he long history womanizing playboy . he even confesses ariane his belief couples " should always behave though they planes " his motto : " he loves runs away , lives love day . " you very easily predict how two going end up , but it happens , film ends , unpredictable , dramatic extremely moving fashion should leave most viewers misty-eyed . maurice chevalier excellent arianne father . some criticized gary cooper " too old , " i think film would absolutely perfect if he few years younger . ( why title my review says " almost perfect . " ) but cooper still excellent choice role . he looked good his age stage presence , time , unrivalled . ( since when tall , handsome , suave , rich men problems attracting younger women ? )	1
stuart gordon dagon surprisingly excellent bit lovecraftian horror , although it feels times like offspring one corman poe adaptations via very wet wicker man ezra godden finds himself rain-soaked fishing village spain where locals long since abandoned christian god ancient pagan one dagon return gold fish . unfortunately , side-effect three generations devotion they're all mutating into sea creatures tendency wear faces those stray humans who stumble across them get skinned alive or mated dagon their troubles ... it may sound cheesy , but while it not particularly frightening it played commendable straight face plenty atmosphere . it just shame writers got little too obsessive hero talking binary systems . lion gate dvd short extras , doesn't include original story listed packaging , but include couple audio commentaries star director , production sketches trailer .	1

this german film directed hermine huntgeburth like comic spin grifters but added sexual component . when one 3 petty criminals who wallet snatch using blind man ploy injured chase , replacement chosen someone who tried steal them failed . his punishment stripped two gay male members team , which prefigures sexual triangle eventuates when both father his daughter attracted new member . we know when we told group rule no exchange body fluids it said broken . huntgeburth gets comic mileage out who aggressor each relationship stolen moments intimacy they fear discovered third party . most refreshing touch how father ( gotz george ) established mean his gay partner , yet he becomes foolish when faced attentions younger man , if he cannot believe it possible , shakespearian appearance george emphasises him classically defined pathetic figure . george actually resembles brunette heavy-set ralph fiennes . daughter probably least interesting role , but felix eitner boy demonstrates bisexual trend modern sexuality , free sexual preference european men , question sex duplicitious behaviour . when eitner pet snake disposed cruelly , huntgeburth sets up expectation his own fate , snake metaphor . accordian music niki reiser sets tone it melancholy suggestion exotic mischief , thankfully huntgeburth treatment lacks concluding cruelty stephen frears title	1

look past surface this movie it really loneliness , range consequences around " falling love " someone you don't know . yeah , characters debauched , stupid things , but it all related their need " connect " someone . all them make mistakes , none them happy end . other reviewers mentioned , this isn't film everyone ; there several gross-out/desperate sex scenes , but they work context movie . i don't much more say hasn't already said ( said better ) other reviewers . i'll finish up adding if you went small , liberal arts college where everyone knew everyone , everyone business ( i ) , trust me , you " know " most people movie probably get weird combination nostalgia " thank god i'm past part my life !

sorry , but giving this set bad rating just because aip-versions aren't included stupid my opinion . this box includes 5 fantastic movies bava ( yes , even " knives avenger " great one ) overall amazing quality very good bonus features . i believe there good reason ab didn't include different cuts " girl who knew too much " " 3 faces fear " : legal issues . if these solved , hopefully we see these versions someday dvd ( though only one really interests me " evil eye " . " black sabbath " would just nice because karloff own dubbing , but everything else clearly inferior italian version . ) until then - enjoy what this box , it amazing value cheap price . course many people who want buy this , already may different dvds some movies there - so everyone must decide themselves if it worth getting .	1

this film everything modern character studies long . ' five easy pieces ' revealing wayward culture ; it strikes audience its emotional interactions ; lets us peer into hearts minds very intriguing personalities . story follows robert dupea ( nicholson ) , who abandoned his well-to-do , intellectual family proletarian lifestyle manual labor promiscuity . his impetus clear beginning -- our culture restrictive absurd , must rejected . but refuting his old life doesn't exempt him world ludicrousness we find him restless discontented opening . arguments his girlfriend famous ' chicken salad sandwich ' scene epitomize this agitation . dupea returns his family under pretext attending his ill father . there , he finds what he believes could his salvation form sophisticated woman who also romantic optimistic ( she doesn't believe she ever bored ) . her , dupea sees reason justification his old life considers it once again . clash interest results , generating sharpest interactions bitterest conflicts . this clash all modern character studies aim . failing show value rejected old life , however , there no good reason clash character seen shallow heartless , leaving audience nothing study . enjoy this picture craftsmanship which rafelson molds internal conflict , art evidently admired these days very rarely achieved	1
while second movie gave us grand adventure first movie gave us ... well , movie , third gives us very mature story . we open dr. spencer hale his daughter , molly . molly only her father now . her mom vanished some time earlier research race pokemon called unown , which look like letters . hale taken up research she left behind , not just research but presumably find what happened her bring her back . every night , he reads his daughter before bed . her favorite book book legendary pokemon , including unown dog-type ( not lion-type ) called entei . molly drawn entei because his strength intelligence , compares her dad him . after bonding scene rings very real , e-mail comes skyler , hale assistant . he says he found old structure more clues unown , so hale leave meet him right away . molly disappointed she left alone , but goes sleep . temple , hale finds some stone pieces , sort like large runes , images unown them . he accidentally releases some , they open portal draw him inside . skyler doesn't see it , discovers too late hale gone . this leaves molly without father , just house caretaker skyler . molly doesn't understand what happened , one night goes her father things returned . included his gear chest held unown tiles . she spills chest open begins playing letters , spelling out mama , papa , molly . " they're together . me , " she says . but she also accidentally activates tiles , unown swarm into mansion . molly isn't afraid . " you want play me ? " unown read thoughts living things alter reality . this presumably what happened hale his wife : they wanted understand unown , so they took them their dimension . molly feels alone like world beyond her control , so unown turn mansion into crystal palace her dreams . they also create mighty entei , which molly immediately latches onto papa different appearance . entei simply says , " if what you wish . " now we get opening credits . i can't remember last time movie took long introduce its concepts instead cast . here comes ash ketchum , pikachu , misty williams , brock harrison . they traveling greenfield , one most beautiful places world . way , they meet lisa , pokemon trainer . she ash friendly battle , which introduces us ash line-up . unlike first movie , where opening battle rival trainer seemed cruel inspired ego , this plays more like it supposed -- friendly if competitive test coaching training skill . combatants all their pokemon all share lunch afterwards , fact , ash lisa complimenting each other reacting self-assurance modesty . she her way greenfield herself , offers guide them . when they get over hill , though , they find most grounds turned crystal hale mansion middle . tv news crew also shows up report phenomena . broadcast watched delia ketchum , ash mom . there some implication she long-time affection spencer hale she might his road not taken . news also seen professor samuel oak , ash neighbor hale teacher . he delia concerned hales , take off figure out what happened . while ash , his friends , oak , delia get together talk events , news crew gets delia camera moment . molly watching news entei her side . she recognizes delia some pictures her hale around house . staring longingly delia , she tells entei , " i want mama , too . " entei leaves long enough hypnotize delia into thinking she molly mother taking her mansion . it falls ash his friends rescue his mom . you might wondering where team rocket , pokemon theives consisting humans jesse james their pokemon comic foil meowth . they get very little screen time , showing up long enough establish their presence , get shot down their balloon , wander through mansion provide some comic relief , save ash falling one scene . they even acknowledge how skimpy their parts , meowth asking one point , " you think we'll get bigger parts next movie ? " how much you enjoy movie hinges primarily how much you believe ' two goal , three act ' story structure villian capturing loved one unite protagonist two goals vital film . like other movies , there isn't really bad guy sense doing something rotten due some feeling personal anarchy . even mewtwo first film didn't seem evil so much misguided needing taught . lot critics i've read complain unown aren't very intimidating villians , but they aren't supposed . they catalysts , plot devices if you . entei literally serves molly wishes , fueling his actions . strictly speaking , movie four seperate goals , stopping entei , saving molly , saving delia , stopping unown , each requiring seperate action . film continually advances no clear act division well . if ' two goal three act ' structure vital you , you definitely not enjoy this film . characterization here full force , characters behave very realistically . best example this brock . brock hound dog . let almost any woman appear , save misty or jesse team rocket ( might missed someone ) , he hit them . jesse villain ( sort ) , misty both too young him they've through enough together she more sister than possible love interest . when molly dreams she pokemon trainer so she battle ash company , she morphs into full grown woman . brock doesn't hit her , though , he remains focused situation , remarkable change . likewise , his banter during duel molly remains true . he fewer instances captain obvious , likewise oak fewer instances captain explination . lisa seems exist just show ash pokemon line-up give him cell phone " pokegear " before he sets off rescue , but even she exudes certain behaviors , like confident strut not swagger . but deepest characterization goes little molly . even when confronted fact world she inhabits not real , she still clings fearfully papa . crystal spikes form walls around her when ash intrudes tries take delia away . ash charizard get upper hand ( during entei vs . charizard sequence ) , spikes start shooting out castle walls aiming them . everything molly dreamworld , including cold inner sactum , reflects her scared mentality . during pokemon fights brock misty , where her tiny creatures score victories against giants like onix only few blows , she laughs delight things go so well her . her laughter frightening since she not feeding her ego , but gorging it . this film dark probably deepest storytelling series likely see . it also coupled , once again , one those annoying shorts start , this one introducing pichu , lower form pikachu . like pikachu , they almost human-level intelligence rambunctious streak . one pichu , seeing pikachu , pats his ass couple times . then later pulls down corner his eye pikachu , which rude gesture japan ( " dear jack valenti , thank you rating . lots love , warner bros . " ) . it bits contradict pokemon continuity don't make any contextual sense , but art nice there some humor . poster says short features " dozens new pokemon their first ever animated appearance . " don't too impressed , i counted only 14 , i think some them appear tv show first . once again , use time get your snacks go bathroom , real movie starts afterward . afterthought : complaint critics how molly reunited her dad , then her mom , long shots during end credits . this portion movie sort travelogue ash journey , giving wonderful sense scope his adventures . one critic particular says this robs scenes their emotional impact . i think it actually helps . movie american pie , characters learn sex isn't everything . yet not one them still virgin end flick . yeah , they learned their lesson , their reward completely negates it . pokemon 3 , defining moment molly life when she opts leave crystal mansion , bravely facing uncertain world without help unown . her reunion her parents important , but it further development her life , not event solidified her personality enabled her take world . coming travelogue , alongside ash he continues see expand his world , makes alegorical sense . but that just me . ----- this review original location site called ' keeping it reel -- movie reviews peter ' . thought it would nice put it here	1

red lantern carefully crafted story centered around young woman named songlian , played ever-brilliant gong li . songlian hopes dreams college better life cruelly cut short sudden unexpected death her father . no money school insistence her mother , songlian forced marry chen , wealthy landowner who already three wives his own . each wives reside separate wings his centuries-old castle estate . living quarters extremely upscale come complete personal servant maid . but , like storied bird gilded cage , their lives sad , empty lonely . although wives command respect obedience hired help , they nothing more than chattel wealthy chen . each day , wives , their respective servant , stand entrance their quarters waiting see which door " red lantern " placed . this how chen chooses his wife evening . " lucky " chosen wife treated ritual foot massage one older woman servants her apartment filled large glowing red lanterns which burn brightly through night . there so many lanterns set up both inside out it , first appearances , seems romantic but quickly ends up underscoring true nature rite . it custom quickly becomes apparant nothing more than lewd , sadistic sexual subjugation . it not romantic , it not passionate ... it just cruel game chen entertainment . story progresses , we see struggle almost every scene . there secret alliances wives , servants elite frequent master estate . there continual animosity wives they plot scheme stay viable remain master good favor . there oversupply backstabbing , betrayal class struggle found all major players . we also see formation disintegration relationships wives . , although master tries present himself peacemaker , it gradually realized he actually instigator most hostility . wives scratch claw ( metaphorically , ) his attention only serves satisfy his own massive ego . cycles abuse perhaps no more apparant when we see wives , who clearly victims their own right , begin victimize each other attempt elevate their standing within social order castle . film rich many moments both sad poignant . example , although songlian not originally welcome ritualistic foot massage , she grew like it missed it tremendously those nights when she not selected " wife evening " . she , other unchosen wives , endure very loud rattling sound foot massage across courtyard . it only further reminded them they unwanted they not special . she miss actual foot massage or what massage represented ? it became nothing more than cruel pavlovian experiment part chen . chen seems enjoy manipulating women . alternating reward punishment , he carefully trains them if they pets . castle cauldron sorts it only matter time before everything bubbles over . without giving too much away , i'll only say storyline moves resulting tragic consequences could hardly seen entirely unexpected . heart this film its exploration indomitable female psyche . film continually centers around very strong female characters struggling survive under horrific conditions both psychologically emotionally . ability female psyche maintain personal identity spiritual freedom within male-dominated zeitgeist feudal china intrinsic this story although this sort struggle not really unique asian culture , it handled very deliberate unapologetic fashion makes this film not only special watch but , necessary well . i've working backwards through director , yimou zhang body work , process i unwittingly saved best last . just kidding ... well , maybe little . yimou zhang certainly director who likes experiment . it seems like he not content make same film over over no matter how good recipe . each his films unique distinct quality . this film lensed very traditional straightforward fashion equal amounts closeups far shots . storyline engrossing carried rich narrative style . dialogue , although integral story seems almost secondary unspoken communication form facial expressions , body language other physical interactions characters . film many long visual sequences which seemed tell story better than any carefully worded text ever could . my opinion , this gong li finest performance date i highly recommend seeing this film	1

i grew up pink panther , it blast able see them all again . i've only finished first disk , but these cartoons excellent . times trickster times tricked , pink panther such outstanding character he pulls you no matter what part he plays . special features fifth disk fun too , especially title credits peter sellers ' " pink panther " movies . that where i started -- watching opening credits " pink panther " then going back first short early 60s . other reviews right when they say some weaker cartoons ones where pink panther talks . it seems so superfluous , like they threw voice him because they needed . but i see where animators just getting sense character those early shorts , it probably worth experimentation just see if it worked . fortunately , saner heads prevailed , pink panther quickly lost his voice . occasional laugh track equally jarring , again appearing one short not next . overall , this set certainly worth it pink panther fans young old . humor light , animation fun stylized , soundtrack rocks . this cartooning its best	1

i invariably credit robert . howard genius behind conan however , this film john milius brilliant it own right . look , if i summed this movie up one word , word would ' epic ' . you feel like you like you've just landed yourself somewhere euro-asian steppe before tides history washed upon mankind . version i bought complete quest which carries both conan movies . conan destroyer ( sequel ) more goofy 80 pizzaz i recall growing up but don't knock it until you try it ! also note soundtrack basil pouldoris . conan soundtracks arguably most superlative movie soundtracks all time . basil pouldoris ties his magic give this conan what i call infinite watchability ... these movies never get old no matter how many times you see them . all characters some extremely memorable lines you grow love . schwarzenegger himself epitomy laconic philosopher stoic warrior approach life but even he breaks out some killer lines . hell , i just wish arnold would third conan instead playing politician	1

i wanted like this film . reviews i read it weren't very optimistic but i don't believe everything i read . unfortunately , this time reviewers correc t.t he dying gaul sensationalistic look people , quite frankly , disgusted me . i am not talking sexual preferences here . these people disgusting so many reasons , none which sexual preferences . i stomach characters unsavory if there common sense perspective given their actions . this film , however , characters revealed decent people who make mistakes . nope . they all creeps . plot film writer screenplay gets emails what he believes his dead lover . what up ? this educated person . he able create complete screenplay so his use language must above average . yet , believe dead person would communicate living - through emails , no less - not something even your average person would fall . yes , there relationship facts given emails but he confided facts person one sending emails . plot film gets even more laughable - yes , i found myself laughing this movie - when old medea plot line came into play . , i'm referring greek medea , not african-american one . although , her films least entertaining ! acting this movie not good others said . sarsgaard most annoying . some scenes he pronounced lilt his speaking voice attempt sound " gay . " other scenes he speaks normally . i found this very distracting . campbell scott , he gives same performance i've seen him give other films . he isn't bad actor but he no paul newman . them all , clarkson bes t.t he dying gaul pretentious project insulting gays buddhists . yes , buddhism plays role film , too . if you want see gay film go brokeback mountain . if you want see movie , time , prove one those wonderful films provokes gales laughter because it so unintentionally funny , watch dying gaul . just prepared learn more specifics gay sex than you probably want know	-1
out all endless undying jason films , this one few series actually provides some scares regardless relentless predictibility . ( jason never dies . dumb blondes run out back door instead front door like they should . car ignition won't work all right times . women make obnoxious screams when they're hiding just merely say ' jason i'm here!' yatta-yatta-yatta ! ) one interesting scene ( obviously i'm male my prime when i say this ) when two lovers humping ' 80s rock music back camper . camper jumping up down . i think majority heterosexual men , when watching scene , left thinking " how come my girl doesn't me ? " these cheesy slasher horror films 80 genre don't much merit categories acting skills , realistic gore or physical animation . but , some kinky sex scenes without overtly pervasive pornographic content playboy some horrific surprises , it proves nice viewing couple dating steadily . so , grab your popcorn your hormones . remember , same hormones chemicals our bodies regulate sexuality also regulate aggression , fear , anxiety , happiness . ( testosterone , oxytocine , adrenaline , etc . ) so , when you combine all these elements into hour half screen interactions this caliber , then it proves quite opportunity some foreplay imagination .	1
my son ( 3 yrs old one month ) watches this car loves this video . he pretty crazy trucks , tractors , like , but some videos just too advanced technical . this one great . tractor segment ( mostly farm tractors ) farm vehicle segment , they show lot different aspects farming , including steps seedling harvesting , eating what you grow , visiting dairy farm ( what made dairy products ) , even using airplane spray insecticides fertilizers . but this all todler- young child level , main guy , dave likeable , very importantly , his voice not annoying all . dump truck segment great , too- they show all different kinds , all different activities- even filling up gas , which toddlers so fascinated . there no catchy tunes , but plus , since they so often what makes video unbearable adults . this video really well , all live action video , narrator acting important participant . it completely holds attention my son , i actually enjoy it .	1

so far , i've bought mutant season one dvd 1 thru 5 . i think this show very high tech stylized . i like how it filmed wide screen . characters kool enjoy stories very much . shalamar best character show primal mutant abilities . this show sometimes hard find channel my area . i missed most season 1 amp ; 2 but luckily , my satelite provides mutant cable network . these dvd top quality yet bit expensive haven't too impressed special features ... one disc bloopers -- it mix match clip collection lasted whole whopping 1 minute 32 seconds ... i love this show , but hope next release seasons , it packaged better features better price range ... only reason i'm buying these becuase i missed seeing show when it first came -- but c'mon they could least put 3 episodes disc if selling individually .. i mean , buffy seasons you get around 40 bucks it 22 episodes your getting .. here , you get 4 episodes like 40 bucks ? talk inflation .. lol ... btw , mutant signed 4th season ! paying hefty price season 1 i live , but really hope seasons 2 thru 4 better wallet ... otherwise , i just may skip out buying them ..	1

" seinfeld " pretty good job rebounding larry david departure show . jerry doesn't many segments featured around him this season , possibly because stepped up demands his time behind camera . however , ones which he featured very funny . example , jerry check bounce , unfriendly merchant puts returned check display his store . word gets back jerry parents , they jump conclusions decide jerry must broke . jerry dad decides return work help support jerry . unfortunately , job his dad takes working elaine , situation doesn't work out anyone . george , reeling mixed emotions he losing susan end season seven , prepares go without her , but finds he really can't . instead , susan parents start charitable foundation her memory george installed board large framed photograph susan framed wall room where foundation meetings held . later season , george meet woman he interested , she seems interested him . george , always trying better his position through lying but usually just worsening his lot because it , same thing this instance . woman believes george tourist arkansas , george decides continue deception faking move city so he continue relationship . way george sees it , if you condense everything he accomplished last ten years into just few weeks , it seems quite impressive . elaine enters alternate universe when she meets kevin his friends , who turn out opposite jerry his friends every way . she likes fact kevin his friends inspire her better person - they genuinely kind helpful they enjoy reading . however , ultimately elaine just not cut out among them because her own selfish personality traits . perhaps funniest episode featuring elaine " english patient " , titled after best picture winner 1996 . her boss , eccentric peterman , loves film forces her go see it him . elaine hates movie , just can't take sitting through it its entirety without blurting out how she feels . peterman gives her chance penance her bad attitude which involves most hilarious assignment . " susie " , due series mix-ups , elaine winds up alternate identity work - " susie " . her coworkers begin discussing her though elaine susie two different people . her ultimate solution problem susie " die " , complete memorial service fictitious woman winds up packed mourners . course , kramer adventures unbelievable ever . this season his apartment turns into " red planet " due neon sign kenny rogers roasters restaurant shining through his window all night . first he doing everything he put restaurant out business , but when he jerry temporarily switch apartments pressure off , kramer finds himself addicted restaurant food . episode , elaine boss jay peterman trying write his memoirs , but finds his own life isn't very interesting . his solution buy kramer life story use it his own . kramer peterman eventually get into argument over details arrangement , kramer answers back starting his own " peterman reality tours " . finally , kramer incensed fact he no longer find public place which he light up cigar , opens smoking lounge his own apartment . result all exposure tobacco smoke , kramer ages prematurely goes his attorney friend , fas t-t alking flamboyant jackie chiles , file suit against tobacco companies . when kramer negotiates deal tobacco companies without jackie approval , jackie declares results " most public his many humiliations " . summary , this season very good more emphasis fast-paced zaniness rather than comedy made more commentary human nature you saw during larry david years . however , i still highly recommend it	1

when i think cary grant , i think suave , immaculate , debonair actor who defined cool his own era well our own . monkey business , delightfully funny screwball comedy 1952 , shows us very different side cary grant . blessed major talent likes grant , ginger rogers , marilyn monroe , lovably huffy character actor charles coburn , monkey business delivers good old-fashioned comedy start finish . grant plays barnaby fulton , chemist working develop age-retarding formula . ginger rogers edwina , his more than understanding wife ; she handles his absent-minded episodes grace style , putting his interests before her own every time . fulton boss mr. oxley ( coburn ) very anxious solution found , he already past retirement age , but some piece puzzle just not fall into place - not , , until one fulton lab monkeys escapes her cage , mixes her own formula , then stashes it water cooler . when fulton tries out his latest concoction , washed down cup water , he soon reverts back teenager mentality , running around like wild man even entertaining lois laurel ( monroe ) , mr. oxley secretary , afternoon . eventually , effects wear off he returns his normal self , but both he his wife conduct several more experiments ( both accidentally well purposely ) movie progresses , each them regressing farther farther back toward childhood each time . naturally , all these goings-on , big , zany ending store everyone involved . best part this movie childlike antics cary grant ginger rogers they carry some time like couple eight-year-olds . marilyn monroe stunning her character never fails produce laughs . lois , who begun coming work early each morning because her boss isn't satisfied her punctuation , not hired her secretarial skills , but , mr. oxley says , anyone type . marilyn gets fair share screen time this early film hers , but there no question cary grant ginger rogers thoroughly steal show their comedic antics . end , monkey business shows youth state mind , best expressed barnaby line , " you're old only when you forget you're young .	1

" dreamgirls , " originally hit broadway production 1980s , lavish musical inspired history motown its super group supremes . like songs " grace my heart " which clearly based career carole king , soundtrack music " dreamgirls , " good it , can't match power real motown sound . actually film musical numbers hardly sound like motown sound , but still some them real showstoppers thanks film gifted stars , especially dynamic singing voice oscar-winner jennifer hudson . " dreamgirls " you should not expect much story , which runs familiar course superstars or celebrities , meteoric rise three rb singers ( played beyoncï¿½ knowles , jennifer hudson anika noni rose ) fame their subsequent troubles ego-clashing within members their shrewd , business-minded producer/manager ( jamie foxx ) . it same old story you heard somewhere else gossip magazines . . once three girls ' dreams come true glitter showbiz , it takes center their lives , once it , none characters allowed breathe much . anika noni rose danny glover not given enough time their characters , even role beyoncï¿½ knowles not fleshed out satisfactorily . eddie murphy outstanding popular singer ladies ' man named james " thunder " early ( haircut like little richard ) , but there nothing new thunder story his love affair fading stardom . still i enjoyed watching " dreamgirls " . i know it lots shortcomings , i hear complaints fans original stage ( which i haven't seen ) . yes , i know . perhaps number film shortcomings depends each viewer taste or expectations , i liked filmed version " dreamgirls " what it . i like it its entertainment values such gorgeous costumes , beautifully staged live scenes cinematography , plus powerful , emotionally-charged songs jennifer hudson , all which compensate lack better story	1

mountbatten described historian man whose " immense vanity hunger publicity power , coupledwith his vaulting ambition propensity realigning thetruth narrowly outweighed his colossal energy charm " . all this portrayed brilliantly nicole williamson this superb production mountbatten terms last viceroy india well its first governor-general . however , this series not only focus mountbatten but shows political religious forces work brought both india independence , but also savage violence accompanied partition sub-continent legacy hate religious fanaticism now threaten not only successor states , india , pakistan bangladesh , but possibly entire world due their nuclear arsenals . series also features excellent performances janet suzman lady edwina mountbatten who one great " do-gooders " history , vladek sheybal enigmatic , iron-willed , tubercular mohammed ali jinnah , especially sam dastor gandhi whose portrayal him far superior ben kingsley film " gandhi " . one drawback series it based heavily memoirs mountbatten his assistant alan campbell-johnson who clearly biased against jinnah fans nehru gandhi , blaming partition india solely jinnah " stubborness " . other historians more nuanced view indian leaders pointing out jinnah accept idea united india under loose federal system it nehru gandhi congress party rejected it giving jinnah no alternative but seek total separation india muslims . similarly , jinnah portrayed responsible war kashmir , whereas according rules defined partition , majority religious group should able choose which successor state they associated , but kashmir majority muslims never given this opportunity becuase nehru , kashmiri himself , insistent taking kashmir india . none this detracts , however , sheer pleasure seeing this vast panorama portrayed television . anyone interested great historical events or personages enjoy this series	1

" happy birthday me " not great movie any stretch imagination . fact , one could even say it not good , but there any denying this movie product 1980 slasher movement horror movies ? either you like 80 slasher movies or you not ... either way this movie part parcel 1980 horror cinema . when i first saw this movie when i kid , i not find it scary then , nor i find it scary now some 25 years later . said , " happy birthday me " dark little tale full surprises . first , you " who dunnit " theme working quite well throughout movie , end movie you couple twists kind surprise you funny kind way . basically , " happy birthday me " girl who trouble remembering dark moment her past when her friends not come her birthday party ... he mother quite angry it . now , she still got her friends , but they dropping like flies this movie one one . there quite few gruesome ( although not necessarily realistic ) " death " scenes which keep gore hound fairly satisfied . suspense decent , but drags little bit flashbacks movie seems " tongue cheek " quality it rather than purely horror characterization . ending my opinion kind lame , but some people love it sure . movie keep you guessing least certain degree , but not enough keep you edge your seat . overall , " happy birthday me " not great suspense flick or horror movie any stretch imagination . sure , there plenty surprises , but surprises only go so far movie like this ... it takes more than some kills , " who dunnit " plot bunch twists make good horror movie . clearly , acting kind bland includes ms. little house prairie too . " happy birthday me " definitely missing something . there some character development , but weakness cast very evident certainly hinders this movie this regard overall well . however , " happy birthday me " just enough keep you watching decent enough kills keep horror movie honest . all all , this really very average horror movie which best appreciated someone who lived through 80 , appreciates horror genre during this time period . you probably won't get scared this one , but you might enjoy this flick its nostalgia , 80s cheese classic slasher pattern if nothing else . so , this group early 20 somethings find out who killer before they all killed off ? , why they killed ? who killer ? what lead character loss memory any this ? answers all these questions more revealed this 80s slasherfest , " happy birthday me "	-1

shakespeare comedy , " much ado nothing , " only positive effect its audience when read . his use verbal sarcasm intellectual farce turns circumstances love into exactly what they many times truly : comedy . shakespeare creates situations appear serious characters within script , yet actually humorous audience . because they able observe things characters themselves not privy , audience able witness full absurdity many messes created within plot characters themselves . while evaluating this play , i found it interesting while shakespeare comedies , " midsummer night dream , " demonstrates how it love causes us foolish things , " much ado nothing " shows way people complicate love themselves . each comedy centers theme love , making it comedic entertaining , yet two hold contrasting views . characters ' actions " midsummer night dream " involuntarily controlled their affections , whether they real or perceived , yet actions those found " much ado nothing " what control outcome love created . throughout this story , shakespeare purposes illustrate many foolish things individuals which only complicate love further than it already . many continually deny how they feel , case benedick beatrice , while others , like claudio , quick fall into love just eager fall out again . love fickleness shown when claudio jumps quickly sharp accusations based upon false testimony , again when benedick beatrice fall love due supposed affection other . story also demonstrates how others manipulate affections , negative or positive results . leonato , don john , other miscellaneous characters add complexity show increase havoc comes increase people situation . this play communicated strongly me circumstances not always entirely complicated they appear . just false identities twisted facts create unneeded , yet hilarious , tension throughout story , putting more stress importance issues within my life makes them more they truly . because this , it not always situation problem , but my own distorted view it . claudio assumptions hero promiscuous nature benedick beatrice quick reaction gossip heard each other two images my own tendency take specific circumstances extreme they should never reach . this play therefore not only enjoyable me read ; it brought light one my strengths times becomes my personal downfall , , making me more conscious this fact , allowed me potential correct it sooner . i wholeheartedly recommend this book , especially those enjoy shakespearean theatre well good laugh . it hilarious story how manipulation our own choice action create complicated labyrinth we unable get out , times don't ever want . shakespeare excellent job poking humor into crevices every situation , lightheartedly reminds us end it our own decisions create , or destroy , mangled outcome we receive .	1

i video store picked this one up whim , recently become avid foreign film watcher . movie focuses couple ( sergi lopez paz vega ) their stormy relationship . two meet office where he works she just gotten job . things start off well . he gets her family friends . she becomes fast friends his coworker wife ( elvira minguez ) . she becomes pregnant their first child . he sees she smoking one day hits her . this first signs violence only escalates after child born . she confides her friends family , who initially play it off , but soon become worried when she starts show bruises . two get divorce but he continues follow her , when she tries get some justice , court system fails her . she tries make well him but comes realization she dislikes him greatly after all he , leading climactic ending . sometimes melodrama bit cheesy , but you feel her fear she gets no help justice system must take matters into her own hands . lopez effectively portrays man who seems know he wrong , yet can't find way change himself . good performances all around . worth viewing	1

i looking billy elliot more than two years . i heard it should very good or even excellent film reason watching it i seen several working title films before ( boy , notting hill , love actually , four weddings funeral ) i found all them much more sincere emotional than average hollywood products . also these british films something offer you rarely find hollywood movies : charming heartwarming mixture sweet funny comedy inspiring touching drama . last month , finally , i found tape . very first moments movie my eyes riveted screen when movie ended feelings emotions overflowed me . billy elliot my opinion billy elliot brilliant movie , easily one best movies year most likely current decade . director movie stephen daldry brought us exceptional , truly inspiring moving , emotional poignant movie . entire story all characters completely believable atmosphere small provincial town somewhere north-eastern england skillfully captured transmitted us . sometimes movie sad , sometimes it funny but stephen daldry work never leave you indifferent . story occurs small coal-mining town 1984 there signs severe depression all over town . you see all around shadow distress even poverty . some simple but incredibly powerful scenes bring us sad feeling hopelessness even despair . there big coalminers strike town but it easy see it also hopeless strike . but all this only masterfully recreated background main story title character , twelve years old boy . he recently lost his mother both his father elder brother striking coalminers . billy forced his father attend boxing classes one day accidentally he see girl ballet classes occur same room he find ballet much more interesting than hated stupid boxing . so he attends those ballet classes instead boxing there nothing surprising after few weeks his father suddenly finds out billy didn't attend boxing worst all he attending ballet classes . main conflict occurs . billy must fight his choice , fight against his own family . there two stereotypes against him . first one ballet girls , not boys ( lads football ... or boxing ... or wrestling ) . second sounds even worse : all male ballet dancers gays . billy not but no one his family except aged grandma want even heard ballet . there only two people whole town , who support him - middle-aged ballet teacher mrs. wilkinson his friend michael , who same age billy who found he possibly gay . this gay subplot easily became conservative audience very controversial question . but fact such stereotypes not invented director movie if you would try learn more this terrific picture you found jamie bell , who took dance lessons age six , suffered similar sneers taunts . billy problem he must fight not only against bad obstacles misunderstanding but also against strong social stereotypes . several brilliant come scenes bright humor greatly emphasize struggles main hero . jamie bell playing billy best performances ever among young actors . his performance ( particularly dance sequences ) so genuine , bright sincere all time we easily feel expression young boy , not director , choreographer or writer . bafta award best actor year well-deserved it pity conservatism academy too often becomes insuperable obstacle many great movies . julie walters ( academy nomination best supporting actress ) billy ballet teacher also great job talented woman talented women who forced teach small provincial town pitiful salary . chemistry teacher student great line billy elliot . two other important supporting characters - billy father elder brother tony also excellent their evolution perfectly showed stephen daldry direction . beautiful soundtrack perfect combination classic ( including nice reference great swan lake ) modern music . original " " rating shouldn't mislead you . except strong language it should easily pg-13 . but this very rare case where some strong language profanity necessary authenticity characters understanding . movie suitable teens it definitely able give some good lessons them . 10 out 10 looks well deserved . thanks reading sorry my bad englis	1

those who read other reviews yours truly , this review , but i divide science fiction into three categories : true science fiction , science fantasy , science horror . often , science horror could called true science fiction , because it based what could happen . however , true science fiction focused more possibilities human reaction , while purpose science horror movie terrify you . this movie terrify you . this movie excellent job its twists turns plot ; you jump least once time movie over . schwarzenegger excellent villain , linda hamilton michael biehn turn good performances . it also small role beth motta , who i remember exercise instructor 20 minute workout , exercise program . one challenge science fiction dealing time travel into past . this successfully achieves goal . i would recommend this movie	1

_triumph will_ ( original german : _triumph des willens_) most infamous propaganda film featuring nazis third reich 1934 nuremberg party rally notorious german film maker leni riefenstahl . movie obviously centers around nazi fascination all-powerful " power " attempts show what accomplished application such political . film features such nazis heinrich himmler , joseph goebbels , rudolf hess , hermann goering but most its focus directed adolf hitler ( " der fuerher " ) . basic point film seems propagandize national socialists showing germany great power strength german military people . film also features appearances s.a. , s.s. , " hitler youth " , all praised hitler himself . most film consists marches german stormtroopers , accompanied music richard wagner ( beloved hitler ) " horst-wessel-lied " or party rallies speeches hitler himself or other notorious nazis . movie also shows much accompanying scenario germany time well featuring scene which farmers dressed traditional garb present fruits their labors hitler . such appeals tradition common among nazis . throughout film , german male soldier/worker presented youthful , exuberant , strong , fertile , powerful . ( some scenes involving young german men frolicking , shaving , even bathing while bare-chested could probably frankly described homoerotic . ) hitler speeches themselves ( well speeches other nazis presented this film ) powerful disturbing . hitler explains his position attempts demonstrate power his party nation . one particularly revealing point , hitler states " state not order us , we order state ! " . other times , various nazi officials express fact " hitler germany " . this sums up cult personality surrounding der fuerher . ( hitler uncanny ability mesmerize people during his speeches commented upon frequently . some maintained hitler himself almost occult influence such times . various theories suggested explain how he came such powers . ) ironically , no point film single anti-semitic phrase uttered . this may intentional . what seen this film though power nazi state military . further , esoteric elements nazi party present , including such features swastika bizarre cult surrounding " blood banner " ( flag carried nazis during beer hall putsch revered nazis since time ) . many noted nazi party itself may constitute form ersatz religion . example , conservative theorist eric voegelin ( who himself escaped germany time ) maintained nazism constitutes " political religion " . such quasi-religious aspects certainly present this film . ultimately though , me least , film pointed out lurking danger may found all crowds group-think . such " herd instinct " overtakes many those present crowd their very selves merge rest crowd , party , nation , german people pseudo-mystical union . thus , may understood mystical aspect national socialist movement , herein , partly lay its appeal . woman who made this film , leni riefenstahl ( 1902 - 2003 ) , interesting enough person herself . begin , one must note time , this film represented advance film technique . indeed , entire film very well put together effectively accomplishes its purpose propagandizing nazis . riefenstahl herself german film-maker who became fascinated nazis time . later , she maintain she politically naï¿½ve largely ignorant sorts crimes they committing ( whether or not she disingenuous this point obviously debatable ) . after world war ii , riefenstahl kept french detention camp some time . she investigated period but never convicted during de-nazification process . later , she would continue produce other works art , but ultimately she remains most ( in)famous this piece . movie itself disturbing one , ultimately , light crimes war . it speaks danger fanaticism . ultimately , despite propaganda presented this film , hitler not serve german people well , betray them very end ( when many innocent germans butchered soviet soldiers ) . this say nothing course hitler other , more notorious , crimes .	1

i wasn't expecting much pulse , such low expectations , i wasn't disappointed . it everything one- or two-star movie could hope . what i find disappointing they good idea somewhere , but everyone working film , top down , seemed miss it . then again , it remake japanese horror classic ( japanese horror films rarely , if ever , make sense ) , so they weren't trying find original story . pity . otherwise quiet college town , suicide rate skyrocketing . eventually our heroes , mattie ( kristen bell ) dexter ( ian somerhalder ) realize there virus , sorts , " system " , odd , silvery specter-like creatures cause it . these creatures , never explained , put themselves face-to-face their victims then it seems they inhale suck some essence their victim , which feeds them - somehow . it makes good viewing , but it doesn't make much sense . because it doesn't make sense , we're not " creeped-out " . since i'm reviewing this dvd , not film , i'm giving it two-stars - because first time i recall , special features subtitled . i'm hearing impaired , i normally miss out special features , even though these special features weren't all exciting , i able watch them .	-1

i am cyclist runner i looking something suppliment rodney yee ( best yoga dvds available ) dvds i . i bought this one specifically because it claimed workout designed different sports . well , it major let down . this tape absolute beginners only . it zero flow it frustratingly slow . they spend several minutes each pose , not holding pose , but just slowly getting you pose then holding it 10 seconds after two or three minutes explanation . its maddening . there no continuity . i would imagine if you true beginner this dvd might marginally useful but once you mastered basic poses it offers , you would then lose interest it because it painfully slow pace . i personally half one hour work out couldn't finish it , it driving me nuts . i went back my rodney yee world right again ....	-1

when i first tracked down copy this film ebay , i bit skeptical . would film live up hype ? could film this many popular voice actors actually inspired ? would this animated movie , fact , change way we'll watch films now ? just 10 minutes into film , i realized answers these questions " yes " , " yes " , " ultrayes " . never before i seen so much emotion animated film .... or even live-action film . finally someonetook advantage medium create work art surpasses quality , craftsmanship , action-packed beauty lively live-action films . there layers . indescribable layers depth . characters , each change frame , each bit dialog , every aspect film seems symbolic -- bleeding effortlessly into each other , into diaphragm american dream . gong creativity gonged . beacon lit . how much longer fiery firesflame ? world we live today , it important films such " my little poney : princess promenade " made . so many others said it better , yet it seems no one able say it all . perhaps it best quote movies final lines ?

early summer not ozu greatest film , it merely my personal favorite . reason simple : noriko mamiya , played incandescent setsuko hara , one most fascinating , perverse , peculiar female characters all world cinema . every viewing early summer peels away new layers her guilelessness , revealing more more quiet audacity . noriko lives her brother ( koichi ) , his wife , her elderly parents , her brother bratty young sons . she dresses simple western styles works typist . koichi imperious man old-fashioned ideas role women , he intimidates whole family . except noriko . not she ever defiant towards him , she simply mastered art smiling deferentially continuing her own inscrutable path life . her family , friends , neighbors , professional associates all take note her age ( 28 ! ) begin pester her getting married before it too late : noriko smiles deferentially every suggestion , insinuation , or act coercion . there even some speculation she might lesbian . one member her family unable advise noriko , shoji , her older brother who . i . . since war presumed ( any reasonable standard ) dead . ozu master evoking what out frame , continually reminding us there unseen world interacts what he allows us see . absent lovingly remembered shoji turns out force points mamiya her groom , man who unites family his absolute unsuitability noriko . my favorite scene , noriko denies her friend aya she love her intended -- then describes her exact feelings him words perfectly define phenomenon love . new subtitles donald ritchie only times preferable ones older prints . one hand , bawdiness some dialogue much more clear ritchie translation , but other hand titles become far more prosaic . sadly , two best lines film all poetry sucked out them this version . i give you original translations , you read ritchie yourself . when koichi finds his two sons abusing loaf bread , translation his outburst used read , " don't kick food ! " lastly , when two elderly mamiyas share sandwich park , they see toy balloon floating off into sky . perfect distillation yasujiro ozu ability draw our attention what off screen , husband line dialogue used , " somewhere child crying .

not many films classified both artistically seminal expression national ( or societal ) self , but this particular movie just . not only caligari first really great horror movie , it also one first make its horrific point clearly logically . this way it precursor all horror films since -- or should i say all good horror films . moreover mise-en-scene so radically conceived consistently followed through there not moment it not repay close study . glib comments german expression this film no harm , but they don't get anywhere near finely wrought complexity characters their circumstances . film dated 1920 , very beginning weimar republic furious outburst artistic activity occurred during troubled 12-13 year period which ended take-over hitler his nadsp . caligari expression expressionism all right , but it also declaration who what weimar . other words this movie much political statement artistic intellectual freedom it simple horror flick . see this film enjoy it : that first requisite any artistic work . but don't see it once . see it many times . fun it : try find right angle instance . end , you come conclusion not one frame carelessly placed , not one character miscast , not one moment sheer horror left stand its own . this great filmaking . it also great expression freedom . no film this sort could made anywhere other than germany this moment ; it unique expression optimism died nazis	1
i fond memories this 1969 film because way i first happened see it . when my father stationed japan we would opportunity every couple months go see late show base theater . movie screened never announced ; you just went took your chances . one time it " one more time " ( peter lawford plays lord sydney pepper sammy davis , jr. charlie salt ) time it " beneath planet apes " ( i guessed movie basis opening shot waves coming ashore ) . one night we went movie starts off bunch confederate soldiers waiting attack then comes john wayne leading union cavalry charge we got see " undefeated " weeks before its normal rotation our theater . actually , john wayne not best part this film . opening scenes deal end civil war . wayne plays colonel john henry thomas , whose men followed him texas fight union not sick soldiering ready go home . plan they going put together herd wild horses sell them representatives mexican government , who offering best price . course , mexico might its own civil war . meanwhile , defeat confederacy arrival northern carpetbaggers convinced colonel james langdon ( rock hudson ) his men there nothing left them south . so his plan lead his men their families mexico serve military government emperor maximillian trying hold onto power . two groups former enemies meet way after fighting indians together achieve something rapprochement , mainly because rock duke manly men hit it off . they two big stars acting together , rock upstaging amiable duke just every opportunity . idea what expatriate confederates during after civil war interesting one , but script only deals means setting up rest film . course since former confederates traveling women ex-union soldiers only brought horses , romantic subplots involve overlooking minor past differences war killed half million americans . colonel langdon sister-in-law ( marian mccargo ) grudgingly sparks john henry , despite fact his unit shiloh where her husband killed . but it hard pay attention any notion mature relationship when young charlotte langdon ( melissa newman ) , colonel daughter takes interest blue boy ( l.a. rams quarterback roman gabriel ) , john henry cherokee indian adopted son , which not sit well her beau , lt . bubba wilkes ( michael vincent before he jan-michael vincent , i swear i not make up " bubba " name ) . nfl player , then relatively unknown merlin olsen , plays corporal little george , gentle giant gets fight honor confederacy time time . you also see former miss america lee meriwether colonel langdon wife veteran character actors ben johnson short grub , harry carey , jr. thomas ' riders , royal dano dignified confederate officer . this really 3.5 star movie . it not good i remember there all sorts problematic elements film simply because " undefeated " pretty much doing things numbers . there no big surprises here once you know players it simply question watching it all play out . end i round up simply because scenes wayne hudson , without getting into fascinating sub-text personification american machismo acting opposite biggest hollywood star closet . i seen some evidence duke knew rock secret , but there nothing film suggest it bothered him	1
if you dylan fan don't own this , then run out buy or order now . this not missed . don't look back , shot d.a. pennebaker ( who almost missed chance shoot document , actually , when partner , leah approached albert grossman , dylan manager ) see if they would intresed touring dylan shoot documentary . leah said , " who bob dylan " when pennebaker returned he flabberasted , but thank god all , stubborn grossman returned contract or deal hashed out over hotel napkin ( true story ) . small budget , don't look back lean , mean production what tour really , but it not all sex , drugs , rock ' roll . hardly . fact , it shows dylan coming terms his own fame how he negotiates this how he negotiates his way through reporters , various interviewers ( one famous scene ' science student ' who dylan toyed game cat mouse , who he asked , " why should i want know you ? what could you ever me ? " time , maybe dylan right . it would turn out , our young ' science student ' went form chrysalis records , so bit mistake - dylan lacked some prescience here . here we see dylan thoughtful , philosophical young man - so many terrific scenes here , including meeting wtih donovan , who running theme joke through film ( tidbit imformation , it donavan , baez dylan who wrote cards you see subterranean homesick blues night before hotel room - better cards donovan because he more ' artistically inclined ' according many reliable sources ; regardless , cards all three ... ) . don't look back first " rockumentary " real form ever , pennebaker should applauded rewarded . opening scene simply dylan holding his cards music subterranean homesick blues , what today we would call music video - pennebaker first open film this style . dlb broken down into sections essentially ; we see dylan concert , dylan hotel rooms frinds , notably baez bob neuwirth who his constant side-kick ( would change 66 ); scenes traveling , scenes green rooms , footage fans some towns . but that it : travelperformancehotel roomsinterviewsgreen roomssome country ( though not much ) . i don't want give away too much . perhaps one other compelling reason buy this version it includes book all text dialogue every single shot film which excellent true dylanologist or writer or journalist . buy it . then buy eat document , which folliwng year note diffrence year makes . this book , if you like dylan , then positively you . sadi ranson-polizzott	1

what this movie lacks plot , it makes up visual special effects . i think hype williams took lot criticism conducting this movie like lengthy music video but i think it actually movie strong suit . likewise , i think while movie might not up par " great " gangsta flicks like godfather or scarface , it wisely not try emulate them either . i also liked all-star hip hop cast/cameos such method man , t-boz , nas , dmx , etc . also , i've hooked some movie film like d'angelo " devils pie " acapella version " however you want me ?

i seen few " angry young brit " movies late 50 early 60 lately . " this sporting life " , " look back anger " , " saturday night sunday morning " leave picture society offers little except tedious life limited rewards . richard harris character " this sporting life " least opportunity reach beyond but he ultimately reminded where he belonged . these movies left me wondering why british life era seemed so incredibly boring while america things really hopping . beatles changed all but then watching " fully monty " gave me impression deadend life returned . it hard get excited all this dreariness but i'm certain directors point make . maybe it dickensian version " youth served " motto . anger , fighting , drinking , love/hate relationships women all portrayed life without joy . personally , i thought " saturday night sunday morning " best lot . although albert finney might slight notch below richards burton harris , i felt his more compelling character ; lost , aimless , but not willing take it sitting down . he seemed care no one but himself ( common trait leading men these movies ) ready sacrifice just anybody keep his life least somewhat enjoyable . burton just plain angry harris obsessed his game but finney used people around him pawns his own entertainment . one those individuals played rachel roberts who played same sort role " this sporting life " . some movies make you happy some make you think . this limited genre film seems make you think you'd happy watch something else instead . yet there life must lived society predetermined where you belong . these movies may impress many viewer i admit acting directing superb all three movies i cited era . however , i came away each one gladder than before i spent those years middle america rather than great britain .	1
if you love romance movie you see this one regency period atmosphere , costumes , settings , beautiful musical score , excellent performances well-chosen cast . it pleasure watch longtime devoted admirer jane austen works , i am very critical any movies based upon her novels , but this one very best adaptations any major literary work .	1
when i considering buying this film , i read all reviews though alot them negative , i decided get it anyway because i am huge fan jane austen books like bbc movies . i very disapointed after watching it ! this one worst movies i seen . i could not believe it ! music much modern time period , they made movie much too creepy , whereas book much more lighthearted , though there some dark parts it . if you're considering buying this , i would advise against it . i hate negative , but watching this movie waste time .	-1

this offbeat story modern day cowboy who falls love minor eventually tries take her away her father . although story centers around relationship harlan ( edward norton ) ( tobe ) evan rachel wood , several other relationships come sharply into play . family dynamic tobe , her younger brother lonnie ( rory culkin ) , her father ( david morse ) , relationship harlan develops lonnie . this film offers realistic , if odd portrayal life . harlan likes think himself cowpoke , making his way ranch ranch , when actually he stuck suburbs san fernando valley working gas station attendant . tobe angry teenager who meets falls love older harlan , against her father wishes . what results beautiful , sometimes almost corny , film relationships , reality , fantasy , how thin line good bad sometimes . if you like independent films actually deliver , theis one you . down valley gives viewers what more movies should : something they haven't seen before . dvd , interview director david jacobson star/producer edward norton provides some insight into writing actual creation film	1
movie " extreme ops " which opened lukewarm reviews even more lukewarm box office really should carry government health warning it . it so mind numbingly incoherent lackluster one feel your brain cells depleted one one after each comic strip moment . let me take back because equate comic strips this piece drivel disservice comic strips . this movie no plot no characterization . point appears display some " amazing " stunt work but effect spoiled over usage truly obvious computer generated effect work would not look out place your home play station . plot , i use term loosely , concerns group commercial filmmakers who travel world attempts catch stunts film . they hired japanese businessman catch shots skier racing ahead avalanche ( reason why never really given ) so this ragtag group heads austria . why they made decision film shot alps instead perfectly good rocky mountains similarly never explained , except it allows them come into contact sneering serbian war criminal fresh faking his own death . understandably sneering villain none happy sharing his mountain hideaway obnoxious group teenagers . he , like theater audience , seems find them just annoying we , but whereas we liberty tuning them out or , even more sensibly , walking out middle movie , he takes more homicidal approach decides away them . i usually try find some good points movie i review so it somewhat balanced , however it hard this flick find something positive say , i guess one could point out girls good looking scenery equally pretty - count ? yourself favor give this miss . i would also recommend you pass it when you see it dvd shelves . there absolutely no redeeming feature this dull , dumb movie	-1

" fair foul , foul fair , " say three witches _macbeth_ , principle holds true film _shampoo_ . released 1975 , one leading members what now called " 70s films , " _shampoo_ story george roundy , hairdresser beautiful sun-blessed city angels . perhaps no other film hollywood placed into more capable hands -- hal ashby , remarkably disciplined but expressive director ( roundy rides his motorcycle through hollywood hills ); robert towne , veteran screenwriter who won oscar _chinatown_ ; warren beatty , one hollywood greats , swordsman renown . film follows roundy he enjoys what he seemingly enjoys most , company women , he seeks start business , his own hair salon . but film , three witches say _macbeth_ , fair foul , foul fair -- which say _shampoo_ , roles reverse appearances deceive . roles reverse central characteristic roundy -- his enjoying company women . roundy world , courter changed courted , courted , courter . why it , or even whether it must or ought perhaps fit discussion -- but it seems hard argue , this reviewer , traditional role guy courtship courter , traditional role woman , courted . roundy world , however , things somehow got reversed . he no courting -- he doesn't stop his movement seeing angelic brunette walking down sidewalk chase her down , he doesn't time his exit bank catch arresting blonde her way out . he no courting . it women who court him . he walking into his shop woman slams her brakes bats her eyes his attention , he waiting one his " friends " ( most likely how he'd introduce her someone ) her house , while he killing time , her daughter comes him . so roundy world , things got themselves reversed . cause reversal significant important understanding roundy . roundy very existence you might say " half free-will " -- half free-will because nearly any matter , he only forced make half decision . constantly courted , he essentially offered decisions approval or rejection . constantly sought-after , half his decision-making process completed him . his life thus whirlwind -- observer point view , he might seen things roundabout fashion . so he ends up sex young daughter , lorna ( played carrie fisher ) , one his friends . how such thing happen ? because he only ever forced make half decision . yet lorna courting him , which she vigor , there lesson well . she comes roundy saying , " wanna ---?" this roundy agrees . however , when one his friends courts him indirectly asking him fix her hair , he turns her down . so lesson seen here , well , roundy thousand one offers any one time , he takes most direct most clearly communicated . thus roles reverse _shampoo_ . but appearances deceive well . perhaps appearances deceive no better way film than manner roundy forced act order start his business . roundy secretly his own master whose altar he must kneel before -- bank . seeking start his own hair salon , he must courting . he must go bank apply loan . it he who doing approaching , it he who conforms standards his master demand him . indeed , no longer it one his friends who putting just right top or just right perfume roundy approval , but it roundy who putting just right jacket putting his raffish hair just right place approval his master -- bank manager . tellingly , he invites none his friends him bank -- he aware his reversed role , he doesn't like it , but there nothing he it . denied his first attempt loan , he must later go see banker , lester ( played jack warden ) . lester husband one roundy friends . here too appearances deceive -- lester believes roundy gay , so lester would quite shocked learn roundy enjoying company his wife . indeed appearances may so deceive this world end deception itself . end _shampoo_ often seen bleak despairing -- roundy shock only person he decides he trust , leaves him , breaks his heart . but roundy heartbreak forever ? it hard not look few months into future see roundy motoring mulholland drive his motorcycle , friend his speeding up beside him her car , flagging him down , smiling devilishly out her car , asking him if he wants --- , roundy suppressing smile , glancing around . glancing what ? nothing . roundy shrugging , then roundy off his motorcycle tailing behind girl her car , already mended , or if not mended , least forgotten -- maybe ! hope ! -- his heartbreak	1
no extras that shame but this still gets 5 stars me . why ? - because second season great it doesn't need extras make it must own fans show . some real classic episodes here color this season . jim artie develop chemistry elevates this show . clever ideas , marvelous stunts terrific art direction this one best shows ever made period . too bad it didn't run 10 years . if not television anti-violence crusade it probably would . long live wild wild west	1

i bought this set rather impulse . i couple " secret agent " dvd love them ( watched , loved , " prisoner " my teens ) . so , knowing those great , surely danger man great too . it , though much different way . i'm watching disks order , so i'm only little ways , but i've enjoyed almost all stories so far . they're bit campy , ( though less so than later series ) ( reviewer noted ) sometimes bit rushed , but generally well written good production values . pat mcgoohan always great . guest actors bit more variable ( few dodgy accents , tendency put ' dark ' make-up anglo actors make them pass indians north africans)but most good job . it especially interesting , first disk or two , see how writers producers ( actors ) gradually settled , making subtle changes they went . ( first couple episodes , they seemed want avoid setting stories any ' real ' places , so they simply avoiding naming them -- leading some bizarre dialogue ' why you visiting our country ? ' ' where you learn speak langauge this country ? ' eventually they apparently decided just make up countries , so we get wide assortment imaginary eastern european , middle eastern latin american locales . ( where , course , everyone speaks fluent english accents . ) looking forward watching more . so why only 4 stars ? least one episodes unwatchable , lots freezing break-ups . , while i suppose i shouldn't complain given price , complete lack extras frustrating . there aren't even any subtitles .	1

this not " war film " it not " antiwar film . " what malick ( former philosophy student ) * use * setting modern warfare way communicating essence schopenhauer metaphysics ethics . underneath surface observable , individuated phenomena , essence world : non-individuated , passionate yet pointless destructive striving . embodied nick nolte , who lives fight win , while recognizing his way way " nature . " " look those vines , staros , swallowing everything . nature cruel . " true insight into nature , however , leads compassion suffering others , since we all one behind appearances , renunciation desiring ( its inevitable concomitants , conflict suffering ) . denial represented jim cavaziel . according schopenhauer , if one recognizes futility willing but cannot achieve this state complete ascetic denial , only other alternative mitigate one own suffering keeping one expectations low possible . this stance embodied sean penn . first , crucial dialogue penn cavaziel , agenda film placed before us : given world it , should we cling this world despair , or should we turn away it transcend ? penn says , " there no world but this one . " cavaziel replies , " i've seen world . " * * what film : choice mysticism nihilism . film not pro-war , because it assumes schopenhauer , moral justifications war always nothing more than rationalizations more fundamental need violence . film not anti-war , because unlike all other anti-war films , it not set up contrast morally praiseworthy form ordinary life morally repugnant form activity created creating war . if war expression cruelty nature , or reality itself , moral judgment it makes no sense --- one might well condemn jungle jungle . this goes some way toward explaining peculiar detachment film aspires achieves . catastrophe characters caught up world itself , film offers no adequate response it than serenely transcend it	1
cary grant . audrey hepburn . hidden megafortune . three nasty pursuers . slick , chic thriller hitchcockian edge . kind formula , it not surprising " charade " deserves every shred praise it receives -- over years , this classic received lot . director stanlet donen his finest moment when he created this funny , witty , tightly-plotted little thriller , where you're left questions right up final scene . while vacation ski lodge , regina lampert ( hepburn ) decides get divorce . but when she returns home , she finds her husband tossed off train -- even stranger , she finds he mixed up gold robbery many years ago . get her mind off her problems , reggie goes out town peter joshua ( grant ) , guy she met resort . but during her outing , she cornered three strange , creepy men -- worst part , she finds joshua may their plot . unsure whom trust , reggie starts digging find out where gold -- then her pursuers murdered one one . she next target ? it sharp , taut little thriller , reminiscent more commercial thrillers hitchcock , though set chic 1960s paris setting , new wave edge . stanlet donen mostly comedies his career , which makes tight plot wry wit this movie stand out even more . movie moving fairly steady pace , one or two dead spots , but mostly just following twisted plot threads . there some really harrowing moments , like regina attacked hook-man . tense finale , lot odd little clues suddenly fall into place , especially murder three thugs . it brilliant piece scripting , even if storyline bit unreal . fortunately it not all spy-thrills revenge . donen could change action horror comedy moment , he keeps quieter moments lively funny dialogue some sophisticated slapstick , like grant showering fully-clad . witty dialogue full glorious one-liners . " you won't able lie your back awhile , " reggie quips , " but then you lie any position . " though grant wasn't wholly comfortable playing opposite hepburn , two actors kinetic chemistry . whether they're goofing off , or chasing kiss nightclub , they feel entirely real romantic . better yet , nobody knows who grant really or what he doing , so there added element danger their relationship . content quality , criterion collection version undoubtedly best , since film lovingly restored every way . however , it also walletbuster . less expensive but equally restored version , try double-bill " truth charlie " " charade , " just forget you remake all . this tightly-plotted , fast-moving thriller deserves well-loved it , cinephiles should ashamed themselves if they haven't yet seen it . must-have	1

you either love movie or you don't . if you're vod lover , special edition 2-disk release worth every cent . film beautifully restored its " color de luxe " panavision widescreen glory . ( my vhs tape barge making its way staten island landfill i type this ) . second disk includes karioke renderings songs several documentaries featurettes ( all listed above ) . my favorite these " jacqueline susann valley dolls , " which generous film clips depicting chain-smoking failed-actress-cum-bestselling-author speaking herself coming across , more than anything , highly committed indefatigable professional writer ( who used different color typing paper each her six drafts manuscript ) . it easy see how this no-nonsense , get-it-done schlockmeister got under skin procratinating perfectionist celebrity syncophant truman capote . ( i surprised see no mention their long-standing public rivalry anywhere among dvd extras . ) missed opportunity among all extras commentary track disk one . it great barbara parkins ( although her memories seem grown rather dim over years ) . one would liked hear patty duke ( or even leigh grant ) well , though we only guess why fox wasn't able make happen . but commentary could greatly enriched if fox nixed use gossip columnist ted cassablanca ( who stole his nom de plume gay character novel ) engaged truly informed movie critic or film historian co-comment ms parkins . casablanca badgers parkins " dish " other actresses , sharon tate murder , judy garland walking out helen lawson role ; when he not badgering , he cooing her perfume or comparing notes her which actors film they each found " do-able . " ( parkins just closed her eyes during her love scenes thought singer cat stevens england . ) both parkins casablanca surprisingly ignorant basic facts film . i found myself frequently shouting tv screen , " watch disk two--it all explained there ! " among things i still don't understand : why so many people dimiss or discount hayward performance merman-inspired helen lawson ? hayward comes solidly out " women picture " tradition seems perfectly cast . her singing voice , supplied veteran big-band singer margaret whiting ( that mrs. jack wrangler you , ted casablanca ) , perfect match ( raw years backstage smoking ) . but , only explanation i come up ms garland fans so much wanted see her singing role they shun hayward performance out perverse loyalty garland . ( garland died two years after release vod , perhaps adding degree fierceness her fans ' loyalty . ) special edition dvd overemphasizes camp cult elements movie ( " bouncing ball " karioke rendering lawson " i'll plant my own tree " really red wig ends up cartoon toilet final sustained note song ) . such thing make fun viewing once . but movie , movie delicious treat lasts forever	1

review cover dvd reads " snappy , sexy thriller ... " i must disagree . this most unsexy , unthrilling movie i've seen long time . my opinion ashley judd doses not fit this roll , it almost comedic . twisted poorly written losely held gether okay acting . seems actors doing best they could what they . i no doubt producers director felt story potential but they failed realize this production . film ending holds interesting twist but too many lose ends left viewers imagination . my vote ? just okay , nothing write home	-1

" herr beethoven , i waiting over two hours deliver this most urgent message ! " composer appeared genuinely confused , " you must mistaken , i only away few moments ! " he then snatched message out boy hands slammed door . my mind , this fine example pure genius work . immortal beloved ( 1994 ) upon its theatrical release panned professional critics over top ; gary oldman overacted director ( bernard rose ) use too many clichï¿½s tell speculative story secret lover beethoven . early nineties time where it fashionable negative critical just everything ... fashionable cynicism . viewed dvd first time since seeing film ( over 12 years ago ) theatre , there no doubt these " professional critics " way off mark . this excellent film manages capture beginnings romantic age music . beethoven right cusp classical romantic movements ... tragedy heroism which mark sensibilities romantic movement stands well represented this moving film . gary oldman one gifted actor portrayed mad genius realism intensity it so well deserves . beethoven music all alone without knowing anything composer continue move audiences ' until end time , however , tragic fact maestro stone deaf while composing majority his music , particularly , ode joy , absolutely astonishing ! it known he actually sawed legs off grand piano , bringing it floor order " feel " vibrations clearer . isabella rossellini countess absolutely superb stunning her eyes convey so much emotion when her character talks her love , maestro . there some beautiful scenes old vienna film , well , this would greatest sound track all time . this wonderful film , love story more than likely greatest romantic history : ludwig von beethoven .	1

i actually think this 2001 low-budget , indie film quirky charm that hard resist , credit goes director/writer/editor brad andersen singular filmmaking style . it ostensibly contemporary love story two misfits , but he laces plot science fiction elements seem contrived first until they start affect characters tangibly . irony these far-fetched plot developments what make movie resonate emotionally . two people center ruby weaver , single woman unfortunate track record enabling men meet her lowest expectations , sam deed , stranger dubuque who may either mentally ill or time traveler year 2470 . ruby immediately drawn sam sincerity but when he confesses coming future , she inevitably feels like she recycling old behavior trying save him his delusions . it reminds me bit john carpenter 1984 " starman " ( where alien takes form woman dead husband ) touch hal ashby 1979 " there " ( where insulated gardener tries make sense world around him ) . however , anderson puts his own idiosyncratic stamp movie making sam seemingly insane assertions credible ruby attraction alternately frustrating empathetic . acting two leads helps considerably here . suffering premature oscar ejaculation , marisa tomei slowly recovered her acting credentials , this performance among her best she dexterously brings out all hesitation vulnerability ruby . sam , vincent d'onofrio tempers his trademark intensity genuine sweetness makes his child-like wonder believable . holland taylor effectively tones down her sassy persona play ruby impervious therapist , while tovah feldshuh grounds film warmth sensibility ruby mother . ending clever nice use stop-motion photography , even if it felt slightly derivative legendary " star trek " episode where bones stopped saving peace-loving missionary ( played joan collins , all people ) killed . this one more infectious than you may assuming set-up	1

this workout really good my opinion . it very squat-intensive . reasons i like it : - although when you first watch it , it seems simple rather slow , it really kicks your butt . reason kicks your butt because all squats other moves require lot leg strength . she good job engineering weight bearing moves aerobic fashion - quite feat , i think . - moves simple easy follow . she good showing them you first giving you warning before change . - even though moves simple , it still fun challenging . - it nice long cardio workout . sometimes i skip this section middle not terribly aerobic ; even skipping sculpting routines end , aerobic part comes 45 minutes , i believe . - ab section quite good . it 13 minutes long . - i believe she only miscounts once . - there really only one time , i think , where camera cuts during transition or new move .	1

" butch cassidy sundance kid " one best films ever made fox recently released fitting two disc dvd edition film . fitting because dvd one best i ever seen . directed george roy hill written william goldman , god screenwriters , " butch cassidy sundance kid " stars paul newman , robert redford katharine ross . how could film this pedigree anything but good ? what you may not realize , or know , this film made robert redford star he today . paul newman , already established star appeared " hud " , " cool hand luke " " hustler " , among others , bankable star film made because he agreed make it . initially , he wanted play sundance kid , but eventually settled role cassidy . robert redford not new film , but he nowhere near icon he would become . he some early success which followed few clunkers . pair became match made heaven would go appear more films together . screen , they appear friends , much like their characters , this adds charm their relationship . redford clearly recognizes influence this film his career . his famous film academy film festival named after his character film . butch sundance decide rob mail car train owned powerful rail baron . butch tired work wants retire , but he needs one or two big scores set him up . after blowing up rail car , they run off loot hide out small town , brothel they frequent . meeting up rest their gang , they quell revolt decide one more job . they rob same mail car same railway , its next run through area . it perfect crime , no one would suspect same train robbed , so it probably loaded money . after blowing up car second time , they notice locomotive speeding towards them crew men horseback alight car give chase , chasing butch sundance , their two accomplices , days , across many terrains . finally , they realize rail baron hired famous indian tracker help band men , including former sheriff who now famous bounty hunter , catch duo . after chase , they return home ella ( katharine ross ) , sundance kid girlfriend . tired , they decide leave country travel bolivia begin robbing banks there . i watched this dvd " butch cassidy " , two things quickly became apparent . this film virtually timeless . lone exception song " raindrops keep falling my head " , film could've made yesterday , images so clear . second dvd print one most beautiful transfers i ever watched . cinematography conrad hall ( who would later work " american beauty " among others ) simply stunning brings out all rich detail landscape . everything crisp clear , when it supposed , colors bright vivid , it just beautiful watch . it doesn't hurt stars two most handsome men ever appear film , prime their careers , one most beautiful women ever co-star . how anyone get past all eye candy ? key becoming fully invested this film william goldman screenplay . he introduces characters action , we learn we go , they almost always moving , or doing something . goldman fills their mouths witty dialogue , showing us how their relationship works , they instantly likeable us . this basically love triangle ross ' ella playing go-between . two men very close friendship , enjoying each other company . but cassidy loves ella well , even appears slightly jealous until he realizes his friend recipient this woman love , so they get . then , there famous chase . railway baron men chase butch sundance days , taking up significant chunk film . but this scene proves us how committed two men each other makes their future trek bolivia all more believable . we believe there real threat these men never let up chase , if they catch butch sundance , they killed . soon they reach bolivia , goldman lot fun characters again , exploring their relationships , rebuilding them way , making them light hearted again . it almost amazing watch this film because if studio executive presented same screenplay today , it would probably not made . it doesn't hit plot points pre-determined pages , it tells unconventional story , we never actually see villains . goldman luxury writing this film during period which studios still able work somewhat unconventional screenplays . course , they wanted make money well , but they still considered film art form . george roy hill underappreciated director . i think large part this because many his films very humorous . comedy not highly respected hollywood drama , even though making good comedy much more difficult . so i suspect humorous elements most his films made him less respected hollywood , but when your films good " butch cassidy sundance kid " " sting " , you deserve some respect . he made his share duds , but when he passed away few years ago , hollywood robbed talent ready make least few more classics . during this period , big screen westerns becoming unpopular . perhaps dearth television westerns keeping public out theaters , but this genre considered risky time . recent films starring burt lancaster others failing light box office fire . second disc contains new " making " feature including interviews newman , redford , ross , former studio executives david brown richard zanuck more . zanuck reveals he took real chance greenlighting this film , but fought it all way . he also haggled hill filmmakers , attempt keep budget under control ; he became concerned when film projected cost $7.5 million ( consider average studio film now costs least $125 million ) . but film would go big hit . such huge hit filmmakers followed this equally popular " sting " . second dvd also contains some archival interviews stars , some trailers more . " making " documentary , they discuss inclusion song " raindrops keep falling my head " . people fought against it but hill composer burt bacharach felt it would perfect accompaniment scene butch ella riding new-fangled bike through her barn yard . it work , but it clearly not fit period depicted film , most dated element within film today . it just seems silly today . " butch cassidy sundance kid " superlative example treatment all classics should receive dvd . this film every dvd library should	1

this just okay , " one-view " film . it beautiful look , so i wouldn't deprive anyone chance view it . but it not film you'll happy own , my opinion . this especially true if you're into bdsm scene yourself . my problem it ? it too shallow -- all costumes performances need flashy . this film actually intended " shock " but it rather surburban . i hate tone " let go check out leather-costumed weirdos . " it rather condescending exploitative , actually . story young man sent undercover investigate " scene " who predictably ( unrealistically ) becomes involved domina played lovely turner ( who some viewers may remember ball cap wearing lesbian girl go fish ) . all characters utterly without substance , paper thin , portrayed very stereotypical fashion . s/m underworld treated over-glamorous flashy way , emphasis again costumes make-up stage performance . this might actually work better broadway musical , like john water " hairspray . " if you want see sensitive heartfelt portrayal s/m , check out japanese film " moonlight whispers . " there , director writer , deeper understanding romantic psychological elements bdsm . film doesn't portray us all like bunch carnival freaks -- media would like believe . so rent " preaching perverted " view once , but buy japanese film " moonlight whispers . " i promise you'll truly love it . it may only authentic , non-exploitative film ever made male submission/female dominance -- so far , it best one .	-1

this movie very good adaptation stephen king story " trucks " king even directed this movie . it concerns passing comet over earth which animates machines including trucks which then go killing spree . trapped dixie boy diner group people including emilio estevez laura harrington who sadly we not see enough movies these days . then you usual car chase , explosions , large body count wholesome destruction roadside diner/gas station . this perfect drive movie which what king mind when he directed it . plus added bonus soundtrack band ac/dc !!! what more could you ask	1

when compared man fire domino you understand this one those movies where average joe life gets flipped upside down when he intercepts very politically , potientially deadly , threatening materials . minute we find ourselves plugged into this man world we introduced several people who keeping tabs him 24 hours day . they wait outside trucks , bugging him , tapping him , questioning him , even picking up satiliete images pin-point his exact location . it gives all new meaning words " overactive paranoia . " but , domino , it related most becuase domino , well , someone normal who evoked change her boring life . this story man who didn't ask his life changed . whihc makes him perfect everyday hero , my humble opinion . enjoy	1
i liked tomcats all its pure cheesiness , then you too enjoy buying cow . it bit far-fetched , but if you're mood mindless entertainment take you away after horrible day work , this flick trick . also , if you like ryan reynolds , he hilarious this . side note other ladies , you get see him naked which always wonderful plus my book . he looks gorgeous ! jerry o'connell character seems very similar his character tomcats , but he still great fun . thing i really liked how they showed jerry o'connell meeting airport girl his dreams his point view well later film , her point view . i thought nice touch . though certainly quite far best movie i've ever seen , price ( found it $5.50 bin wal-mart ) it great addition any dvd collection	1
peter hyams ' remake richard fleisher 1952 narrow margin focuses more atmosphere scenery than it film noir . it make cool , if bit too short , movie . gene hackman loudmouth deputy da desperate get big daddy mob boss behind bars . when shy book editor witnesses mob assassination he treks out middleofnowhere , canada drag her into court testify . problem arise when bad guys show up wilderness blow crap out her cabin . brilliant , rustic car/chopper chase down sheer slopes mountain forest follows . it great scene some cool shots sharp editing . once they reach bottom mountain they find train station board train private cabin . bad guys follow , only they still don't know what their witness looks like . many scenes hiding seeking make up rest movie . it doesn't sound like much but peter hyams ' widescreen photography used max promote sense claustrophobia even quieter scenes dominated sound train charging through dark canadian wilderness . one particular scene monashee station really take advantage ' middle nowhere ' feeling . bruce broughton score kind okay , but nothing loud exciting score he originally created . peter hyams disagreed ( he often his composers ) chopped up broughton work post-production . thus , music movie more underscore much more action-based cues missing . i wish it last longer more scenes train ( coz trains cool ) but , what it , narrow margin tightly wrought thriller gene hackman top form always fun playing older guy suit who still get into fights car chases if it his everyday job . filmed panavision dvd 2.35 : 1 anamorphic widescreen dolby 2.0 soundtrack . though 5.1 would better there still some surround use . r2 dvd universal also better cover art than r1	1

there many surprises this year academy awards . one biggest absence nominations several films , most noticeably this one . containing no sex , no nudity , no bad language , no gore , no grand action scenes , minimal comedy , non-descript sountrack , only several seconds violence , this movie none hallmarks top movie . but top movie it ; it sat atop box office charts month everyone who seen it comes away impressed . this one those movies stands out its inventiveness , its innovative mode storytelling , its twists turns many points plot , ability make viewer empathize all main characters . great movies themes , this movie multiple . first obsession , not necessarily revenge , but also winning , best , what others more . second rivalry . many movies tried show how friendship evolves into deadly rivalry . examples include star wars : revenge sith , gods generals cleopatra . none these job good this movie . neither character , alfred or angiers , good , neither bad . both professionals trying reach top their professions , if this means backstabbing each other , so it . third sacrifice ; everyone sacrifices more than necessary achieve their ends , result all around lost loves lost lives . most impressive aspect this movie its mode storytelling . 1980 , pulp fiction came out introduced circular method showing movie . then came sixth sense 1990 method flashback end redefined entire movie get-go . then there star wars movies ; sequels first then prequels later . now we prestige ; three different storylines spliced together create play time . movie great , dvd good . no extra or deleted scenes , just interviews , explanations special effects , poster art . overall , great watching experience	1
i've watch " green street hooligan " several months ago thought it good movie but this film like rush blood head . " football factory " ultimate head blowing , jaw clenching , white knuckle ride film . this film all elements make up night exciting viewing , though provoking characters , witty dialogue energized music watch boys batter each other . begin theirs tommy , fast approaching 30 not clue what his sad little life , only thing heï¿½s clinging onto next big meet billy bright foul mouthed , bad tempered geezer who lost ability engage his brain long time ago , heï¿½s only comfortable using his fists . rod who stellar performance restaurant , acts perfect side kick tommy , bill farrell perfect gentleman bygone era harris mean-faced leader who could vinnie jones breakfast , plays distant yet commanding leader . but i like young kid who plays zebberdee , scaly living like vermin depths south london , this all credit acting it must difficult play someone who so detrimental society very little redeeming features . credit must given all actors they all deliver stellar performances what must most unglamorous locations . there isn't one performance i would say weak they all hold audiences attention gage us into what they doing saying . i found violence fashion very realistic . " football factory " more than just football , its loyalty , sense belonging this dysfunctional world .	1
first time i ever heard inxs , i watching " friday night videos " somewhere around 1982 . they performed " one thing " live slayed me . i remember dancing like idiot high school swing . years later , i saw inxs salt lake listen like thieves tour . i managed slip up onto mixing scaffold sit right under board almost entire show . perfect view , perfect sound . i amazed how good this band live . later i'd learn it just testament how much they toured , how devoted they fans . i saw them again ( 20 years later - sheez ) greek theater berkeley jd fortune , again amazed how well they sound person . i've seen this concert video number times over years , but finally got around purchasing it couple weeks ago . i've stayed up late watch it , after wife kids go sleep , several times now . they definitely " " this show . michael vocal quality superb , each member band appeared their peak . camera direction editing make it feel like you there , english fans out this world . i've never seen sea people motion way these folks . no wonder band popping . everyone just feeding off each other . this video stand test time . it like watching old doors footage when jim his prime . i don't think i'll ever tire seeing it	1
lon chaney first long line phantoms one against whom all his successors measured ... story , despite all its alternatives , familiar one musician avoiding world because his disfigurement retreating hideout beneath opera house , where he emerges terrorize singers audience alike ... he kidnaps young girl singer - perhaps teach her become great star ; certainly because , his grotesque pathetic way , he loves her - carries her off boudoir he prepared far underground ... there melodrama plenty : first version , example , two would-be rescuers found themselves trapped uncomfortable mirrored room phantom prepared , where they first got heat treatment then flooded ... but , beyond all heightened effects , it pathos phantom underscoring his lonely menace which gave character dimension , isolation captor his captive , imprisoned literal underworld , which gave suspense whole film its power ...	1
i this workout once week , over 100 fitness videos i own makes it one most used . it only 19 minutes long , not too terribly tough but i feel it working . i only tried few winsor pilates videos but this one i like most far . mari winsor leads you through this workout joined some her instructors her hollywood studio . she starts side kick series , which includes front/back kicks , bicycle , leg lifts , big small circles , hot potato . then she move into some inner thigh work inner thigh lifts , then you lift both legs up later lowering bottom leg up down , then you finish off scissors . next segment called fetal thighs . you start your legs fetal position leg lifts , then you more leg lifts but knee pointed downward , this followed clams , elevated clams , yet more elevated clams but adding leg lift . entire side kick fetal thigh series repeated other side before you finish out leg beats final stretch . i like this routine , it short point . there times i need short pilates those time crunches days , this fits bill . if you pick one winsor pilates video , this best one my opinion . highly recommended	1
this dvd very educational anyone who pre-schooler . it really helped my son recognize his letters . if you would like education fun dvd your pre-schooler i highly recommend this dvd	1
i going automatically immediately buy this film because it presented mondo macabro , name i learned really respect trust . mm introduced me now half-dozen astonishing films i'd previously never even heard . well , i hesitated buying this because mixed reviews here amazon . so , i rented it first netflix . well , i watched it last night . this movie totally solid , replete suspense , beautiful venues , awesome music soundtrack , some scantily clad women , exotic atmosphere which many us love these european films . there surreal ambience this genre which totally addictive , thus i every mario bava , jean rollin , dario argento film print , most jess franco stuff well . what sometimes lacking plot more than compensated scenery dreamy weirdness . ( i actually like these movies despite common theme murders women , not because them . i realize danger , evil diabolical acts necessary create tension , just dirty harry-type movie . this movie particular , however , only showed two women killed , only one murders graphic . these scenes certify bad guy bad , but they certainly aren't my favorite scenes . i know some fans these movies like spectacular gore . i personally don't enjoy it . ) anyway , i suspect negative reviews this film come people who more into hollywood big productions lots special effects big name actors like bruce willis , steven segal , billy crystal , bambi . if you already determined you enjoy hidden treasures heyday " euro-trash " films ( totally ironic epithet due fact these categorically most artistic films ever made ) , you enjoy this film . it may not your absolute favorite , but you absolutely glad it your collection .	1
my only reservation this program i would liked more circumstances behind sam death . he very influential singer business person , but he also man . may too much certain people stomach . fact program features interviews sam family shows it approved - also mean it whitewash , sanitised public consumption . fine line walk . just like kennedy assassination , one gets feeling there still more told . i believe writer peter guralnick writing book sam if it anything like his books elvis , it compellng reading . great program worth watching whether or not you fan this wonderful singer who may never reached his true potential	1

anchor bay makes some fantastic dvd editions classic horrors , great price . their necronomicon editions evil dead films , well their special editions dawn dead suspira worth every penny . i bit disappointed see this new edition re-animator only because it third special edition , it doesn't contain much others don't ( just one featurette ) . addition limited edition syringe hilighter great idea , it looks really funky . however , inside box dvds standard plastic keep case , which i happen hate . i'd rather cardboard folder packaging than plastic keepcase , which looks so cheap . least cardboard cd cases , you get all over full colour print , without plastic covering . also , there no inserts inside package save single slip cardstock print one side , chapters other . if you want keep higlighter dvd , you keep them both box . it not flip cover dvd box either - just regular box crushes easily . movie , if you fan , remains fantastic . commentary ( which appeared three versions date ) very good - i liked comparing director point view , experiences actors . three principles clearly great time working together , they plenty say making film . there only one special edition bride re-animator i'm aware , i missed getting copy when it released few years ago . now first film released again special edition package , i'm very hopeful we'll see better edition bride than bare bones one currently available . that really most exciting part this new release .	1

this movie probably gets overlooked because title , which seems incredibly dull unimaginative such cool flick . i think it should called quot ; superatomic submarine vs . flying saucerquot ; because what movie really it sounds much more exciting . movie everything fan 50 sci-fi b-movies would want . story unique twist flying saucer theme because this saucer travel under water , you get two classic sci-fi vehicles price one because this flying saucer takes futuristic ( remember this 1950 ) submarine . parts take place inside saucer very creepy . during these scenes , pitch black background cool creepy music used maximum effect . there few funny lines movie , especially ones where hero talking alien who , way , not disappoint those who love cheesy cool aliens their sci-fi movies . i three words b-movie fans : see it now	1

this dvd 3 famous concertos brahms , tchaikovsky , sibelius . beside , it also beethoven " kreutzer " sonata ( rehearsal ) , beautiful capricci locatelli , piece lalo , one kreisler . so , what more you need one dvd ? compare many dvds ( cds ) , i believe oistrakh played 3 concertos above best . like sibelius concerto , this issue much better than ferras or vengerov dvds , better than heifetz or marcovici cds . moreove , sound quality amazing good .	1
this fine swordplay movie directed sammo hung . i enjoyed movie because its mix action , romance exotic locations costumes . fight sequences fast moving fun watch . i especially enjoyed seeing maggie cheung action . romance movie equally strong adds emotional element action sequences often missing other movies . if you don't generally like action movies because all there fighting , you might like this movie . i listened mandarin soundtrack , but spot checks cantonese soundtrack showed it might marginally cleaner . subtitles white part picture , so they can't turned off . however they very clear i didn't notice any quot ; polar bear snow stormquot ; effects subtitles becoming unreadable . this movie i would recommend action fans superhero fans alike	1
book upon which this dvd based come back into limelight post-enron , pos t-t yco , post-refco , post-worldcom , post-adelphia world ethicless business . dvd gets this part book right . like major rich characters this dvd , today ruthless robber-barons , cheat their wives , demean their employees , spend money lavishly conspicuous consumption . but gatsby never gave million dollar party like head tyco . so much similar : no one knows where rich people money coming . everyone assumes there something illegal few people all money poor people pushed further into poverty . but , no one seems doing anything it . when general motors steps away its commitment employee pensions , united airlines , ibm , this book becomes more more contemporary . even more so when executive pay rises double digits every year . tom buchannan , adulterer this classic , would fit right into today business elite . gatsby ( robert redford ) himself mysterious , but , although his background first world war revealed book , it not found film . his background turns out similar many veterans who returned vietnam , or iraq , find rules business changed , most part , there no effective enforcemen t.t he real lesson this dvd wages sin death . gatsby dies case mistaken identity . his death triggered buchannan infidelity . this message america needs see . i watched this film when it came out . but before enron . i rented vhs watched again after internet bubble burst , just like stock market imploded 1929 , shortly after book written , sweeping millions into poverty . time book became popular , thousands people who hoped like gatsby living streets . if they read book during depression they would happy gatsby got what coming him . what you think gatsby when you see dvd	1

i remember these 6 episodes , which famously known " ones without john cleese " . this probably main reason they've never widely televised us . i remember only seeing them once great while , while watching them , i didn't realise cleese wasn't them , because they absolutely hilarious , they just good anything python ever produced . cleese gone , palin jones took over writing , deliberately made long form sketches , i.e. story thread running throughout whole programme . this works brilliantly michael ellis , light entertainment war , mr. neutron . sketch " anything goes " song light entertainment war side splittingly funny . mr. neutron show gets hilarious digs us ( something pythons weren't really known doing ) , michael ellis brilliant one buying ant . i get somewhat annoyed people who dismiss these episodes afterthought , because they stand their own any other python episode . after show ended , jones palin went onto ripping yarns , which many similarities these 6 episodes . i remember taping these 6 episodes while they comedy central , because i afraid i would never see them again . but i dvd now , so i'm ok .	1
if you've never encountered robert anton wilson , skip this dvd buy yourself copy illuminatus ! ( fiction , writen robert shea ) or quantum psychology ( non-fiction ) . if you're already fan wilson work , you're unlikely learn anything new here ; but you'll probably enjoy yourself all same . if , like me , you never got chance met wilson person , this probably close we'll get sitting down chat elderly " uncle bob " . there also random assortment material varying quality earlier his life . my recommendation brief : read some his books first , then leave this video playing your tv you go your daily chores let uncle bob worm his way into your brain	1
probably everyone one favorite movie they consider " their own " because few , if any , their friends share their admiration it . mine this one . i just love this film . it only one out over 5,000 movies either rented or purchased i watched back-to-back nights after seeing it first time . dozen viewings later , it still just good , if not better . it , star t-t o-finish , most entertaining crime movie i ever watched . fan film noir , those wonderfully-narrated crime films ' 40s ' 50s , romeo bleeding right up my alley . i may wrong but believe this whole film simply parody film noirs : outrageous take those movies over-the-top villain ( lena olin , most fascinating female i ever come across film ) , over-the-top characters , action scenes , dialog narration . it wild , fun - albeit sick - ride , not taken seriously ( which lot people then thought it too goofy ) . evidence this film-noir spoof dialog , number fantastic dark-humor lines , many delivered olin . one see this number times catch all humor here . kudos screenplay writer hilary henkin her work . oldman superb its glue holds this unique story tact . his narration , including exaggerated inflection his voice , fantastic . i appreciate american accent this british actor used , too . olin , russian hit- woman mona demarkoff , she one character i guarantee you not ever forget . roy scheider , annabella sciorra , juliette lewis , michael wincott others - cameos dennis farina ron perlman - all deliver great performances lines , well ,.... i said , outrageous . if you love old film noirs , please check this movie out remember it tongue-and-cheek .	1
i loved first two dvds this anime this one continues story effectively gives good backstory rosette , chrono , joshua . ( first two episodes pure flashback which tad annoying , but effective making joshua sympathetic . ) next episode gabriel hound which coolest vehicle yet . last episode standard christmas special focusing azmaria . reason i don't give this five stars it not nearly funny first two dvds , while last episode light az annoys me , watching dub ( i usually check both dub sub . ) satella worst german accent history . i mean worse then asuka evangelion du	1
we two children , age 4 7 , decided this movie little too violent scary them watch . our children home-schooled therefore , little more sheltered than average child . i'm pretty sure we friends same-aged children who would let them watch this . however , overall , this movie very entertaining . we love actors it very entertaining whole thing .	1

this movie very good , even compared original punihser movie , unless marvel wanted make punisher more like comic book , movie would ranted nc-17 . it would nice see punisher fight kingpin , too bad mr. fisk appeared daredevil , regardless who frank fought , villian would die end . if you want something else , go watch something dc , like batman 4 mr. freeze . make mine marvel .	1
this series changed televsion . it not deserve end season two . i wish there way bring it back or lynch write comic book , novel tell us what happen our beloved characters . if you like x-files , millennium , lost , , wild palms .... then buy this series .	1

i loved this movie . sure , there gore , but not overdone . story took prescedence . angst younger brother familiar every family . his angst happen fitting family monsters , but audiance could relate subbing anything . wilder , older siblings painted picture rebellion sewing wild oats almost everyone age group goes through . everytime audiance relates regular family attributes , monster part movie reminds us this horror film . this very good , entertaining movie . it fresh horror movie mostly original twist . i never bored or felt killing overkill . i would recommend this movie every true horror fan , especially those who tired slasher movies no story	1

... if howard hawks proud making this . sure cary grant didn't seem happy playing this part . i can't think any good actor who'd enjoy lured into such preposterous plot which should got sheridan some oscar impersonating one most insufferable bitches screen ( there no shortage , but very few less funny ) although responsibility more lederer disappointing script . this opinion first 15 min . only , since i don't know if it gets better afterwards , but i couldn't stand it any longer : last 5 min ( 15 ) ordeal .	-1
this dvd based bob anderson well-known book same name . it provides solid introduction basic athletic-type stretch , albeit rather dry manner . dvd nicely chaptered ; i've listed chapters ( times given menu ) added my own short descriptions below . getting started , 7:09 . this short educational segment stretching which begins showing people engaged various athletic activities stretches ( somewhat dated-looking ) . bob anderson then comes screen reviews his philosophy stretching . he emphasizes stretching not exercise stretches should feel comfortable all times ; he focuses " easy " " developmental " stretches opposed " intense " stretches . bob also introduces his two models , marlon debbie . neck back stretches , 12:14 . this first segment , bob leads marlon through series very gentle stretches back , mostly reclined position . there no neck-specific stretches , but bob reminds you keep your neck alignment your back . legs , groin , hips , feet stretches , 12:30 . here , bob leads debbie through nice series standing sitting stretches lower body . most stretches held longer duration ( 15 seconds ) , bob also includes instructions massaging your feet , although only one foot demonstrated . upper body stretches , 10:20 . this my favorite stretch segment . starting kneeling moving standing , bob again leads marlon , this time focusing stretches shoulders , neck , torso ; it ends nice upper body twist . everyday stretches ( daily routine ) , 12:29 . this final segment instructed bob alone via voiceover . here , bob includes stretches each above segments form nice full-body routine . however , because there more stretches included , he also moves more quickly through each stretch ; i would liked see some longer holds here . addition , i found music quite distracting jarring , it alternated loud bells/chimes no music all , which i not feel very conducive relaxation . soemthing this dvd didn't really " click " me ; mentioned above , i found it quite dry ( bob barely cracks smile entire time ) thus not very relaxing . however , this solid athletic stretch dvd could very useful someone who looking short stretching routines incorporate into their fitness regimine and/or daily life	1

i saw this film more than 14 months ago . time , i not quite acquainted films didn't watch many i now . this surprisingly one first brad pitt films i seen . me he only good looking actor . after watching epic like seven years tibet , i know i am fan life . when this film starts pitt shown army officer somewhere europe ( think it hungary ) i thought it would based war solely . this film brought adventurer spirit me . there more than nature , huge land masses , different kinds people hills seven years tibet . this movie celebrates friendship way quite difficult me comprehend . relationship dalai lama pitt heartening . what more hearetening pitt character film how he stood alone windmills time . pitt character both stupid mentally very strong film . i'd rather not describe how it evolves into satisfied mind . tibet beautiful . indian , i knew some places shown this movie so it felt special . lastly , this one most under rated films i seen . i own this movie now . amazon recommends kundun if you like this film but i not . there no film same stature seven years tibet . if you're newbie want watch some other brad pitt epics then i suggest you watch " seven " , " sleepers " best film he " troy " kundun rather slow documentary like film plus no brad pitt .	1
there number films underdogs world . most them comedies . necessary roughness one them . it how texas state university lost its championship status due cheating , steroids , pay-offs , etc . therefore , entire team expelled tsu . new recruits actual student-body . coach riggendorf ( robert loggia ) said , " mass suicide ! " team made up bunch misfits way-out individual characters . president tsu ( fred dalton thomson ) wanted ed " straight-arrow " gennero ( hector elindonzo ) lead new team . but there catch . dean ( larry miller ) insist applying strict rules ; ie : " no pass , no play . " ( referring their grade-point-average ) so number students try out team . fair batch made it too . but since most players didn't make grade , they kicked team dean . forced them play what called " ironman football " ; where team plays both offensive defensive . not easy feat . also , they needed really good quarterback . so coach rigg enlisted paul blake ( scott bakula ) , who best high-school . sadly , he give it up when his father passed away , take over family farm . tsu armadillos begin some serious football playing against other universities/colleges their area . but some hilarious commentary chuck niederman ( rob schneider ) pressbooth . they even manage get football player/science professor join ( sinbad ); well lucy place-kicker ( kathy ireland ) . all they want achieve football life win least one game . blake wants his fellow teammates feel what he high school - just even once . i find movie amusing even downright funny . cast characters hoot .	1

i believe it observed , more than once variety ways , all life like gigantic mirror . we see ourselves , everywhere . , if we beautiful ( inside , where true beauty lives ) , then we see beauty everywhere we look . life beautiful puts this idea test . it posits carefree , happy-go-lucky book salesman who romances well-to-do lady mussolini italy ( film starts just onset wwii ) . he weds her , they rear child , they soon put into jeopardy due his jewish heritage . ultimately , they sent concentration camp where his carefree , imaginitive unceasingly joyful attitude only things keep him , his son , utter despair . humor ? romance ? carefree ? nazi death camp ? some , this blasphemous . but makers this film , our lead character , life beautiful , this vision taken their perspective . film manages show there joy , love beauty -- even worst imaginable conditions -- testament way which film succeeds , also basic truth message . yes , things may awful ( more often then not , they ) ... but yes , also : life beautiful . this film gets my highest recommendation . five stars	1

" lol . i'm curious if anyone else ? i sure wish umd would include extras like dvd . i know many items dvd not included here . matter fact , i can't recall any extras included . 4 stars . i notice some " extra " timed scenes part bigger scenes . i'm sure this " unrated " portion . again , its not fair use words like " unrated " extra scenes . this only implys it more raunchy than " rated " version , this not honest consumers . shame those responsible . all all , i would recommend this only additon dvd . alone , you miss too much , shame considering all dvd offer .	1

this excellent film adaptation excellent play . produced 1958 , it feels fresh , important modern -- minus few anachronisms -- today it then . paul neumann elizabeth taylor star brick maggie , career-defining roles which they received oscar nominations . they supported equally talented cast ; i particularly enjoyed madeline sherwood sister-woman , strident , manipulative matriarch ever-expanding brood " no-neck monsters " . purists note changes made script make movie palatable movie audiences time conform hollywood production code . while it water down things bit , i've seen filmed versions truer source material but lack power depth this adaptation . dvd doesn't come oodles extras , but ones present worth viewing .	1
this oscar-caliber performance gena rowlands . this woman takes no stuff takes mob when they after disk little boy possession . already wiped out kids family ( because his accountant father ripped them off ) , they don't just want disk they want kid , who house during massacre , silenced . i think perhaps flick " professional , " ripped off plot this movie , replacing young boy little girl . any rate , let not digress : young puerto rican child john adames cannot act lick . he precocious cute , but he head size soldier field . here some tidbits chew : accountant white man married gorgeous latina . they beautiful teenaged daugther younger one , all who get wiped out . bad guys converge apartment they live , this man singles out little boy gives him disk . he tells little boy " always man " then sends kid off while he rest family get butchered . what all ? why didn't they phone house ? why didn't they try escape crowded streets below unit ? not only , but when gloria kid run , she wondering why she doesn't just dump kid . young boy falling love her because he seen her shoot five or six guys defending him . they move two people who cannot stand one mother son . although kid acting skills giant mouse crack , gena rowlands more than compensates streetwise toughness , gentle compassion when need , undying commitment keeping this young kid alive . must-see	1

actually , i thought " penny dreadful " most innovative film after dark horrorfest certainly not worst ( would " hamiltons , " hands down ) . i went whole route " 8 films 2 die 4 , " catching all eight films their first showings each day , buying my tickets advance get free t-shirt , then waiting monster it depicted show up one films ( it never happened ) . films while we got our free pop refills ( i recommend just getting your large drink filled up halfway so you make it all way through movie ) , we would sit around dissect each film make recommendations ( " audition " film most mentioned ) . end festival my impromptu straw poll found " penny dreadful " much support any other film " best show " title would earn one eight general release . we thought they would go " dark ride " most commercially viable bunch , but they ended up picking " abandoned , " which its own uniqueness heroine mature woman twice age title character this film . this third movie second day i should explain we running gag going regarding connection women cars established these films . first day ended " dark ride , " which involved heroine driving mini-van through wall right time right place save day . second day started " gravedancers , " which same thing happened ( i think it suv time ) . followed " abandoned , " which begins ends woman driving giant farm truck . so time " penny dreadful " started we all chuckling fact characters such small vehicle because it just standard car . car question driven orianna volker ( mimi rogers " ginger snaps " ) , psychologist who trying get penny dearborn ( rachel miner " guiding light " ) over her phobia cars . we find out via flashbacks she car accident claimed lives her parents , so she good reason traumatized experience want avoid driving around car again . but orianna taking penny road trip help her get over her phobia . penny stop every gas station way so she puke up her guts then things get worse . when orianna clips pedestrian lonely stretch mountain road she figures least she give guy ride . fact his face obscured hood he skewer meat him not set off alarm bells orianna telling rest us this big mistake ( you seen commercial where guy picks up hitchhiker ax because guy carrying bud light claims it just opener ? ) . now you know full well given this setup orianna going dead penny going face hitchhiker . what you not expect most film going take place little car ( not ask how maniac set up this scenario , just go it ) . point you thinking there not much you given this scenario , but i think you pleasantly surprised . director richard brandes ( " out blood " ) co-wrote screenplay diane doniol-valcroze ( " kill inches " ) . there not lot horror films come up such simple scenario then stick it ( i always think stephen king short story " survivor type " novel " gerald game " examples one note take extreme approach ) . yes , initial requisite bad decision compounded series other fatal errors ( i believe i actually said " drive rims " out loud theater ) , but fortunately this 2006 horror film relies more penny phobia specific situation play out story . given penny phobia i bet you think you know exactly how this movie got end , but ending this movie not go obvious . again , this speaks determination brandes go against expectations come up something different . i certainly appreciated audacity doing slasher film where most action set around car stuck woods . net result not great horror film , if your taste runs extreme gore films like " saw iii , " " wolf creek , " " hostel , " et al ., then this one going seem dreadfully tame . but i pleasantly surprised hopefully most you who decide check out " penny dreadful " dvd feel same	1

rest stop horrible movie . sure there many killings , some decent amount gore creativity , but doesn't make up bad plotline less than pleasing cast . end alternate ending both make no sense whatsoever , after watching this movie , you'll wonder why u wasted your money how anyone could've thought this good movie	-1
it funny claude rains shot fame " invisible man " when we only see him few seconds end movie . but such power james whales movie . just directed frankenstein mr. whale given free run this project he ever take it run . this still very powerful movie wicked humor it still make you blink quality f/x time . add deep rich voice claude rains you get classic first order . problem none other films live up promise first they really not good , most falling into comedy even if they weren't ment too . still they worth look because first movie belongs beside other monster collections	1

guillermo del toro ( who directed last years phenomenal pan labyrinth ) seems his best when dealing paranormal ; indeed , he uncommon gift making fantastic seem plausible . this film contains some most haunting believable images i've seen screen , their efficacy heightened director understanding when enough enough . ghost stories any kind fail when real or imagined ghost absurdly presented . most today contemporary " master horror " fail miserably . it 1939 , spanish civil war its final days . carmen doctor casares run orphanage boys ( one wonder , why no girls ? ) . institution remarkable feature : middle courtyard bomb , tip which embedded firmly ground . bomb fell sky during raid , but never exploded . it sits there , disarmed yet immovable , reminder violence outside world . carlos , ten year old , left orphanage , though carmen argues they no resources more children , she accepts him assigns him bed number twelve , bed santi slept until day he disappeared , which same day bomb fell sky . carlos , predictably , begins see visions shadows , first , it isn't understood whether these come his mind or if they real . one night , shadow tempts him behind bed curtain , when carlos pulls curtain back , shadow gone . but pitchers water boys ' room fallen their stands break , when other children awaken , carlos jaime each take pitcher refill kitchen . carlos sees footprints spilled water . when boys reach kitchen , jaime pumps water his pitcher , waits outside carlos . carlos pumping , rack scissors kitchen falls makes loud noise . jacinto ( eduardo noriega , open your eyes ) , young caretaker who once orphan himself here , comes investigate . carlos flees down into cellar hide , there he encounters shadow taunted him . he touched his phantom cellar , we see , before anyone else , this image real . it boy , no older than carlos , upper left portion his forehead cracked open , pale , blood seeping upwards if body underwater . after touching carlos , ghost quickly disappears , but voice says , " many you die . " it prophecy demands fulfillmen t.t here gold orphanage , gold carmen casares give those called nationalists , support their cause . jacinto knows this gold , he wishes steal it himself . not only he bedding conchita , beautiful young cook ( jaime wide-eyed crush ) , but he also taking carmen bedmate . it unusual coupling ; carmen principal when jacinto orphan there , she wooden leg she must set aside accept him . ( some small irony there . ) when they partner , jacinto takes replaces one key her large ring keys see if it one open safe holds gold . jacinto , ghost may least their worries . this excellent film , one better appreciated second viewing . i've heard it compared others , but i doubt such comparisons would made if director writer others , alejandro amenabar , not also mexican . while they both ghost stories , they operate under completely different rules . i highly recommend this . 4ï¿½ stars rounded up five convincing " paranormals " .	1

yes , el dorado similar plot rio bravo , it stars " duke " directed same director . but , el dorado much tighter leaner script , doesn't contain any dreaded " filler " like rio bravo , nor it woefully miscast ricky nelson .

( " splinters hand " scene seen believed ! ) highly recommended	1

this my first leslie sansone set , but it certainly won't my last ! this exercise series features walking place , accented different steps- side step , kick , knee lifts , etc . this particular set comes stretchie , long band rubber [ ? ] you use while walking work out your arms well your legs . leslie very motivational , she talks you through whole program , which something i enjoy but some other people may not . she group backing walkers who walk background behind her , they range vastly age- there 70-plus year old man walking , few women their 60s 50s well one her 20s . exercises fantastic- simple enough anyone them , very low-impact easy joints , they require very little space . only complaint i this set background music- it seems kind " off " me it gets boring after while [ it not really music , just keyboard beat some guy saying " walk , power walk " over over again ] . that small concession this fabulous exercise program , though . thanks leslie	1

you might interested this spanish/argentine film because inclusion gael garcia bernal ' motorcycle diaries ' other superb latino-american films . yes , he it , but what more impressive outstanding acting cecilia ross , star ' all my mother ' ( wife fito paez , director ' vidas privadas ' aka ' private lives ' ) . she gives strong acting heroine this very unconventional story . cecilia ross middle-aged carmen , visiting her ailing father buenos aires , argentina . carmen now living madrid , apart rest her family , but film story unfolds , we realize she often looks restless uneasy even though she back home . but carmen more peculiar habit . every night , alone dark room , she listens sounds young couple making love next room . she not eavesdropping or spying ; she doesn't even know their faces , she fact hires ' lovers ' ( including handsome model played gael garcia bernal ) . but why she ? melodramatic story follows fates carmen young model who both attacted each other through their voices , film not crave credibility , giving emphasis upon emotional turmoil unlikely couple , so if you say plot impossible , no one blame you . but those who laugh this apparently incredible chain events , or who wince intentionally ( i think ) exaggerated sound effects piano strings , would miss film point . previous reviewer says , understand film we need keep mind film nature akin greek tragedy , which we mortals all frail erring . behind these all-too-human characters you see ghost atrocious dictatorship argentina , which started late 70s . now it gone , good i hope , but it still torment those who involved , whether oppressors or oppressed . though film cast give unanimously good acting , it cecilia ross who most impressive , times literally dedicating herself character . fans gael garcia bernal would not disappointed , whose character plays crutial role latter half film . just wait while , you see his good performance . similar theme ( sad history argentina ) taken up ' imagining argentina ' starring emma thompson antonio banderas . i didn't think it good , but well , just case you're interested .	1
it nice see two lead characters movie flawed talk , act , react like normal people . even though movie clocks more than 2 hours , it didn't feel long . viewer i looked forward next scene not because i anticipating big revelation plot but because i so taken story i want know why they act way they . movie opens mary mcdonell , who played soap opera diva , hospital oblivious fact she surgery due car accident would make her unable walk . she assisted numerous nurses but all them quit because her not so pleasant attitude . then came alfre woodard , spunky nurse who problem her own . she only one who able handle mary mcdonnel . relationship two women , who living lives they never imagined living , heart soul movie . what i like movie it didn't resort melodrama order tell story full punch . ending not resort quick resolution where both ladies ' problems go away two leads suddenly become best friends . they would probably still face same problems they would still probably fight occasionally , but now they better perspective looking things more important , they now acknowledge how each affect help each other obvious ways not so obvious ways . it low key but beautiful ending movie ended two ladies boat facing each other sunset . grade :	1
if you don't watch this movie due negative reviews then you missing out something ... not something great but pretty good sequel . some people just following what others saying so they won't sound ' uncool ' saying they like it . let rewind minute or two back when this movie came out . i saw this theatres i tell you people jumped during those 3-d shots same way they during friday 13th part 3 3-d ! chewed off arm shark breaking glass , effects not bad all like most would you believe . movie itself , i thought it pretty good . you shark lagoon scary enough . but towards end when you see mother shark tale whip back forth break gate open due force shark strength your imagination let you aleady wonder how big this shark ! you also shark hunter this movie his partner try cage shark up begin . you big name stars like dennis quaid louis gossett jr. joining cast . yes you stereotype ' must ' every shark movie guy/girl relationship , shark hunter , weak character/brother , businessman , etc . there actually many things going this movie my opinion i go into negative things also like anyone else . but bottom line this movie not one , but two big sharks . it also some suspense it like parts 1 2 shark coming up it victim behind . idea big shark swimming around sea undergound see-though glass structure people walking just makes it much better . it not jaws . nothing even close first one . it not jaws 2 many would agree worthy sequel truth they could stopped right there would good set open/close . but if you look jaws 3 something other than sequel judge it it own .. heck , pretend it name like maybe shark attack 5 or something i am pretty sure you think this movie least better than most said jaws 3 . not classic but good saturday afternoon/night movie .	1
2nd this evangelical christian sci-fi thriller series even better than 1st ( i reviewed one , too , if you interested . ) . part its charm its b-movie budget , effects , sets , locations , acting . not read books i still entertained story kept my interest despite its holes , preachiness . acting mostly not-wellknown actors good excellent , made me care good guys , hiss bad . i'm looking forward round 3 . leave any religious bias behind , just sit back enjoy entertaining little film .	1
i first saw " good neighbors " ( 1975-77 ) late 1970s pbs , shortly after show completed . i impressed wit comic timing actors , subtle comedy which didn't hit you over head make point . when they came market vhs format , i decided buy them installments , am very happy i . you likely know story : richard briers plays tom good , frustrated 40 year old draftsman who works plastics company . good his wife barabara ( felicity kendall ) decide " get back basics " thereby tom quits his job , turns yard into huge garden , buys chickens pigs livestock decides become self sufficient , bartering only what they need , etc . not practical life style 1970s suburban london . contrasting their neighbors : jerry margo ledbetter , played paul eddington penelope keith . mr. ledbetter executive plastics company tom good used work ; he crawls grovels boss keep his high paying job , which supports his expensive well furnished home . ledbetter slave his work despite finanicial prosperity ; good doesn't answer boss or schedule , but faces obstacle after obstacle his crops or livestock . chemistry comic timing all 4 principal actors very fine , laughs many frequent . despite impractical plot - no one would get away livestock subdivision anywhere civilized world long - this makes wholesome entertainment . i haven't seen dvd version comparison , but vhs tapes very good quality : clear picture , great camera work .	1

i love these types movies , b/c all reviews this page very thoughtful interesting . i agree most everything , but one thing keeps popping up i disagree idea characters totally unlikable . i personally find characters extremely sympathetic . these people all incredible pain . they miserable . not one single character happy . they all trying medicate their pain , oblivious fact love they all seeking within arms reach , yet they step each other " get theirs " such extent end no one happy . yes , may incredibly bad mother , but she shell person her entire life , practically no joy whatsoever . ditto others . how world these not sympathetic characters ? i lot love my life . course i sympathize those who none .	1

i am curious whether or not any my fellow reviewers ever actually played game ? this movie not made stand its own , it made supplement universe . characters mialee , lidda , redgar iconic characters who known gamers several years . story not really meant tell background characters or how they got together , rather it designed tell part their story , one many adventures group together . personally , i liked movie . yes there only 4 endings but , what you want them ? this first choose your own adventure dvd , fact first choose you own adventure dvd i seen . i watched story 6 different times each time garnering new information yet get forth ending . if one so inclined they could go through movie dozen times still probably not see every scene combination available . people who buy it dissapointed because its poor game , news flash ... its not game . it dvd choose your own adveture story based game . i liked able watch movie recognize mialee casting fireball , or group fighting earth elemental summoned druid . yes it very basic concept game but , thats all it meant . first time shot dark see how people react such concept . anyways i highly reccomend this movie anyone who plays or similar fantasy rpg . just keep it mind this isn't best fantasy story out there but its definatly good start choose your own adventure genre . calsu	1

things eventually come head once clouseau gathers all interested parties one room , intent expose killer who he surely believes among group . many would say shot dark best among pink panther films , i'd hard pressed argue , but i've always partial pink panther strikes again ( 1976 ) , one where dreyfus , after escaping asylum , threatens destroy world unless effort coerce nations world send their best assassins eliminate clouseau once all . while shot dark may not screwball some later pink panther films , it still extremely funny , entertaining worth most anyone time given strength writing wonderful performances . sellers , well sellers , bumbling , awkward , nincompoop detective who , somehow always manages come out top ( but not without few bumps bruises way ) . it difficult picturing anyone else role after seeing sellers ' performances , but we given opportunity so 2006 release starring steve martin . i yet see new film , but i really no desire so i don't think it live up originals . sellers perfected role , i little interest seeing someone else trying top something i doubt could topped . anyway , sellers helped way great performances herbert lom , clouseau beleaguered supervisor graham stark clouseau unfortunate assistant . throw lot humorous dialogue , goofy situations galore , henry mancini memorable scoring you've got one heck comedic adventure . some my more favored parts film include running gags , particularly one where clouseau dons any number disguises , all which end up him arrested various misdemeanors ( one scene he disguised street vendor selling balloons order follow maria unnoticed , but he quickly arrested he doesn't possess street vendor license ) . great sequence occurs when clouseau tries follows maria surreptitiously into nudist colony , he can't gain entrance until he strips down himself . i've never seen so many carefully place set pieces obscure all naughty bits inappropriate pg rated film . then there various bits clouseau manservant kato ( later films he known cato ) , played burt kwouk , who instructed his employer attack clouseau when he least expects it , if only continually improve his employers ability deal unexpected . finally there finale , clouseau gathers those remaining one room , gets whole lot more than he bargained once revelations begin coming furious pace . all all this terrific murder/mystery comedy , one worth watching more than once . picture , presented both widescreen anamorphic ( 2.35 : 1 ) fullscreen ( 1.33 : 1 ) , looks very clean , dolby digital mono audio , available both english french , comes through clearly . far extras , there eight page booklet , original theatrical trailer , subtitles english french . there also hidden feature , one found clicking title main menu , revealing vintage promotional ad . cookieman108by way , if you don't happen own any pink panther films dvd but interested buying them , look pink panther film collection dvd set which includes pink panther ( 1963 ) , shot dark ( 1964 ) , pink panther strikes again ( 1976 ) , revenge pink panther ( 1978 ) , trail pink panther ( 1982 ) . only one not included within set return pink panther ( 1975 ) , only because mgm somehow lost rights film universal pictures , who release movie onto dvd 2006 ( thankfully ) .	1

film restoration work looks sounds magnificent . eddie kramer gets extra congratulations 5.1 audio mix . said , 3rd disc mainly stereo only . karen review below bit harsh . if you actually listen main film commentary , you understand why more footage isn't available : not every second 3 days performances captured . concert films not exist genre this time ( see annoyingly choppy ' festival!' documenting newport ) , so this new territory point film make document gave overall feel event time . pennebaker his crew decide which songs film , which seems predetermined dylan buddy bob neuwirth who more familiar scene than filmmaker . they would turn red light stage signal start filming next song . some times , they didn't plan camera men would shoot their discretion , so some performances may captured only 1 camera therefore considered not presentable . also , film reels would end during performances need changed ( approx every 20 minutes ) , hence footage missing two jimi songs . regarding lack more outtake footage : 1 . your precious janis big brother new manager albert grossman didn't allow them filmed first day , but finally they asked play again next day because crowd reaction desire get something film . whole set could exist but i doubt it . grossman his need control probably blame , it no coincidence woodstock filmmakers also refused use her footage original release . she only appears now directors cut . 2 . byrds set extremely historic , one should included whole if it exists . 3 . who set only missing ' pictures lily ' not counting ' my generation ' which proper film . it bootleg who dvd so why wasn't included inexplicable . i would like seen all footage each artist set put together bonus disc including songs included whole or part actual final film , so it all one place . what we get anything besides what made final cut . 4 . far tiny tim , yes his impromptu performances annoying , but they part just , impromptu candid backstage footage supplied bonus , not part 2 hours bonus footage . so , skip past it like i get over it . 5 . regarding grateful dead , small glimpse seen beginning ' jimi plays monterey ' film , but liner notes 4cd box set 1992 tells us , like janis , band or management refused allow any audio or visuals used . i assume they didn't like their performance , or wanted control it like rest their own vault . whole festival charity , we also learn supplementary interviews , artists therefore sign waivers releasing rights their performances . my guess it dead refused comply . 6 . real shame there no footage lou rawls ' electrifying set , which would also show more diversity genre festival . 7 . charles shaar murray commentary during hendrix film actually quite insightful entertaining . yes , there some funny comments substances clothing . he wrote definitive biography jimi , his commentary well founded gives context why his perfomance festival revolutionary . said , this definitive package , must own release serious rock collector library	1

original version cape fear thrilling its presentation any modern thriller or suspense . it dark mood it , creepiness , requires sense restlessness part audience : all important facets suspense . dark mood film personified within first ten minutes film , we see malicious ex-con max cody ( played robert mitchum ) lurk background court then finally confront man who he seeks revenge , lawyer sam bowden ( gregory peck ) . bowden doesn't immediately recognize cody , this only seems engage his sinister nature even more . bowden , this point , must all he protect not only himself , but his family against this man . perhaps what makes this film work simply mitchum performance max cody . there despicable nature cody , hard-edge persona there viewer see , but there still something else his mannerisms really get under your skin . unlike some outright villains , he not so much open book manipulative temperament . instead raging raising his voice injustices , he smirk his face calm manner while planning plotting , this makes him even more mysterious malevolent . he quintessential bad guy , probably ranks among most despicable characters film history simply because his relentlessness perversion . without giving too much away , if there one blemish , it would seemingly rushed ending film . it somewhat satisfying , but it seemed though there would more tell end . this , however , not take away performances , over all affect film . great movie watch if you want see top-notch thriller ! 4 1/2 stars	1

years ago i saw nicholas cage `8 mm , ' which pretty bad film , leaving some nasty taste my mouth . then someone still remembered this forgettable film , decided re-use title again lure unsuspecting viewers like me . fact , `8mm 2'was originally called `the velvet side hell ' forgettable film absolutely nothing nick cage thriller . apparently film categorized thriller or mystery , but greatest mystery how this kind dishonesty allowed all . film director refers film " sexual thriller . " surely it sexual , but never thrilling . right beginning includes one incredible laughable sexual fantasy courtroom , david , aspiring ( boring ) politician played johnathon schaech so many ridiculous things it impossible believe he could fiancï¿½ tish , daughter american ambassador budapest . these lovers stupidly seduced night budapest when one glamorous lady named rita shows up before them . cue obligatory `threesome ' scene . they blackmailed . they search rita who just disappeared . they go further into underworld porno industry city . they deep trouble . we going see just predictable ending not clever filmmakers seem think . [ tedious , so tedious ] actually , earliest stage `8mm 2 , ' tedium settles , so you cannot enjoy film even `so-bad-so-good ' film . film tries stretch poor story more than 100 minutes , which told most thrill-free , by-the-number way , without giving couple any real dangers . film also attempts show psychological changes happening characters , tish particular , but unfortunately poor acting leading lady cannot convince us she fatally attracted world forbidden her . one scene two ladies dancing together clearly inspired `basic instinct , ' but there no sharon stone her fearless audacious performance , which not afraid campy . johnathon schaech director . . cardone worked together `the forsaken ' `mummy ' armadillo . ' probably `8mm 2 ' worse than these , much worse than nicholas cage original . only thing i thought good it beautiful buildings budapest . but many scenes shot night , even this fun denied us .	-1

this truly one most spectacular films ever made , not suffering made during silent era . however , correctly stated review film , dvd version runs 139mins oppossed vhs 155mins . this not due dvd faster frame rate , but rather because dvd version huge portion film cut no obvious reason . one point , hero ( fairbanks ) fulfilled prophecy princess first touch rose-tree , next minute he seen explaining her ( intimate scene ) he not what he seems . seen vhs number times , i confirm dvd version brutally cut . not buy dvd version , it let-down those scenes missing ; thus reason my one star , which would otherwise 4 1/5 ( 5 stars rimsky korsakov soundtrack ) . you warned	-1
" five hundred dollars !

ok , so i bought this dvd because one my all time favorite actors it ( i'm huge jimmy stewart fan too ! ) . while this movie good back drop cary grant , plot bit bland ... spoiled rich man must make his own living year win bet . some meetings his quot ; moniedquot ; crowd , while he working stiff , entertaing , but not really memorable . maybe i'm used his later movies where he really shined , but this movie just didn't grab me . or maybe it quality dvd . i might gotten more out it if i turned sound off , sound track bad . there few skips usual quot ; old filmquot ; wrinkles visual , but they wouldn't so hard deal if i didn't keep adjusting sound .... even then , some dialogue still sounded like gibberish . could i've just got really bad bootleg copy . i advise against purchasing dvd whose cover case shows cg shoulders up front car stone house .	-1

i found this documentary insult my intelligence . here facts : 1 . ) pete best not very good drummer . simple . all you use your ears . all one listen tony sheridan recordings , decca audition tapes , early bbc performances beatles , emi session pete best hear clearly he best competent unexceptional . i mean , that hour music which judge this guy . ringo contrast distinctive touch energy drums immediately brought musical quality beatles much higher realm ( which good drummer usually rock'n'roll , it " beat " oriented music . who without keith moon , or zeppelin without bonham just isn't same . go listen hour earliest recordings beatles ringo it no-contest . sorry pete ! 2 . ) what really offensive this cash-in documentary worst kind-is recording ( pete best band ) beatle sound-alike music soundtrack . when i mean beatle soundalike music , i mean mccartney bass lines ala revolver era , high up neck-jangly guitar or day tripper .... basically beatles music pete best absolutely nothing , subtle implication ( after hearing how much pete best contributed beatles " sound " ) pete might responsible such progression innovation . obviously nothing could further truth . why not record versions early rock'n'roll songs , material pete actually played beatles ? i mean , why am i hearing folk-rock jangle over black white footage depressed liverpool early 60 ? 3 . ) best , not first time , reveals himself one most humourless , dim liverpudlians i've ever seen-and that after seen countless documentaries beatles liverpool scene . less beatle-y personality you'd hard put locate . this just revisionist documentary guy who always sour grapes ( understandably so ) . guy written his autobiography three times . there no mystery why pete best ( correctly ) kicked out beatles . he wasn't one them . , despite revisionist testimony this documentary ( what else these guys going say pete ? they still see him liverpool , work beatlefan convention circuit him ! ) , he just really medicore musical talent . not worse , but nothing original , nothing contributory . he laid down passable beat , he incapbable " interplay " , least based musical evidence available . not so ringo ! go take out your copy beatles version " long tall sally " tell me pete best capable . or beatles version " i'm gonna sit right down cry over you " , either star club or bbc radio recordings . no way . sorry . not million years . very first recording beatles ringo ( " some other guy " cavern club ) , ringo drives band authority , sets down solid groove , contributes interesting , often melodic drumming ideas still influential this day . pete never set down such heavy groove , least not abundant recorded evidence . screw him ! don't waste your money this documentary unless you're completest . trust me this .	-1
first film this trilogy , koyaanisqatsi , classic , features what possibly best score philip glass ever wrote anything . second , powaqatsi , not good but still worth watching . this third installment offers none thought-provoking imagery first two films . it just mishmash computer-treated footage , signifying nothing , all quite forgettable . i wonder what went wrong ? don't waste your time	-1
i would put this classic midnight movie .... movie potential funnier than it but wound up far more disjointed than it should ... it seemed like they trying " hard days night " type film . obstacle they faced johnny rotten wanted nothing this film , only seen concert footage interviews . us tour footage great watch , they really should released dallas san fran footage its entirety here . way , it this film made sid vicious tragic hero turned him into even more cartoon parody himself , but " my way " scene classic . animation funny , silly , memorable . it also fills some blanks , like lydon stabbing record company incident where they out control . would made great adult cartoon they chose take it all way . film worth it pistols footage , but whole ronnie biggs thing pretty much pointless . steve jones malcolm mclaren provided barebones " continudity " throughout film . glen matlock also seen but nothing much more . film essential pistols fans well fans punk rock , although definitely not anyone under 16 . if you're looking documentary pistols , this not film . julien temple " filth fury " pistols documentary bar none puts more depth into vicious well lydon involved , classic albums series " nmtb " , ramones " end century " well . johnny rotten would try his hand acting film called " corrupt " harvey keitel (!) , film went nowhere . don letts ( who there beginning ... dj well big audio dynamite member ) made 2 great films , " punk rock movie " which came out middle punk movement more recent " punk : attitude " which i'd recommend because he talked people who helped shape , influence execute it . here list other recommended films : sid nancy , slc punk , repo man , urgh ! music war , decline western civilization , doa , clash - westway world , fabulous stains , state mind , suburbia , reform school girls , rock roll high school , rude boy , vh1s 25 years punk worth tracking down well .

i remember seeing this movie when i preteen , even back then i witnessed acts violence within my school . mark lester visionary , but brilliant class 1984 foresaw somewhat epidemic events regarding school violence well spawning few imitators . ( i.e. substitute , principal , 187 , class nuke em high , suburbia .. etc . ) best way describe co 1984 would based movie influences ; clockwork orange meets blackboard jungle .. but more grittier . tim van patten deserves praise props his convincing portrayal peter stegman ; psychotic gang leader who his cronies behind drugpushing , gangbanging ( more ways than one , if you get first last 20 minutes film . ) sabotage other capers outside lincon high school . there quite few disturbing moments within film ( spoiler alert)such when black drug dealer cornered stegman gang which stegman utters ; " we're only n*****s here sell drugs .. " this same actor who starred predominetly black cast . ( white shadow)now that acting . mutilation corrigan animals .. peta damned , corrigan ( brilliantly played late great roddy mcdowel planet apes fright night . ) holding class hostage , gang rape scene involving andy norris ' pregnant wife jusfitied rage norris ( mandingo perry king)in which he burns , beats bonesaw sinister gang memebers . very end bit hard swallow ( unless you suspend your disbelief . ) but very satisfactory . m.j. fox role really nothing me i feel king especially van patten parts should've propelled them major stardom . ( guy even wrote personally performed poingant piano scene . ) there no justice i tell ya . my major disapointment dvd , tim rest cast wasn't included blood blackboards retrospective . lester commentary bit dull but it better than bare bones disc . there actually unrated version dts sound over uk . i doubt if anchor bay release it here states , but it better than nuttin'great movie help put punk scene cinematic mapand cool theme song performed shock rocker alice cooper . great 80 classic alongside escape ny , terminator , aliens , road warrior etc . thanks anchor bay !	1
" welcome paradise . name dante ! " so begins sandra bullock jason patric harrowing adventure seaborne legend . beautiful ship , friendly passengers , attentive crew would ordinarily make splendid cruise . unfortunately , among passengers madman who bent ruining everyone vacation . though it would appear this film not universally well-loved , it actually one my favorite action moves . i enjoyed main setting : cruise ship . passengers very funny . among them couple who selling new diet regimen called fat busters , where " fat your friend " ( so body won't try hoard fat , making weight loss difficult ) . their fellow shipmates , surrounded cruise ship banquet-like meal , heartily agree . deaf girl who signs wonderful . villain entertaining . ( admittedly , story behind his motivation destroy ship may rather contrived . ) action moves ocean-liner , speedboat , personal water-craft , propeller aircraft , then finally tower high atop oil tanker . ( if you've ever wondered what it would look like see oil tanker blow up , your curiosity satisfied what happens next . ) all , this movie little like trip amusement park . there lots action this movie , no small amount comedy	1

decades movie going collecting , there only few films keep coming mind unexpected moments . me , this what great art ; , it becomes part one experience not just momentary diversion . sacrifice great film . it touches most fundamental questions human our post-modern world . it it extraordinary grace sublime , haunting , beauty . miss point this film , some reviewers , or call it sophomoric , others , admit one own inability consider life itself may hold greater meaning we more than accidental fluke cold , uncaring universe . this film dares use its considerable art challenge us like zen koan prayer . it meditation what it means fully human mortal moral . it asks us wonder unknown it weeps we prisoners our humanity -- we hold fate our planet our hands . all this sounds kind pretentious , i know , but this magnificent yet simple film works higher level than most movies . it not easily categorized . but big screen , i hypnotized extraordinary cinematography equally transported subtle ideas . it transcendent movie going experience i didn't expect one remained vivid years pass	1

review simply irresistible good cook like sorceress who dispenses happiness . " ~ elsa schiaparelli sarah michelle gellar softer side appears she picks up batterie de cuisine tackles saving restaurant certain death . when it looks like amanda career end chef , angel appears her life gives her some sage advice looking door open when one closes . chef failing 70 year-old restaurant , southern cross , she only her loyal clientele who not there food . say she adorable chef understatement . she appears variety fashionable outfits weaves sweet innocent spell viewer . worth watching see sarah dressed up variety outfits different hairstyles . there also scenes outdoor markets , beautiful orchids course restaurant scenes , sarah shopping , cooking crawling floor chasing after magical crabs all romantic music . instead slaying vampires , " buffy " bewitches tom bartlett ( sean patrick flanery ) entices love right into her life through cooking variety gourmet dishes . if every man his weakness , tom weakness luscious cuisine .

" my whole life ordinary then we met these amazing things started happen . " ~ amanda it love makes amanda better cook makes her cooking taste even better tom ? their senses state heightened awareness chemicals rushing through their bodies or there magic floating ? once she finds recipe caramel eclairs , tom even more attracted her . there very few movies cooking or chefs so this one treat . tear drops food reminded me like water chocolate . emotions amanda feels somehow magically mixed into food she cooking . either dishes make people cry , stun them or make them lose their inhibitions . she seems magical gift culinary creations effect anyone who consumes them . after watching this movie you may want feed your lover oranges , invest some expensive vanilla extract , get lost kiss or cook up some bliss . if you looking best vanilla your cooking , bourbon-madagascar vanilla superior . deliciously cute , silly spells , sweet innocent love few hot steamy kissing scenes kitchen . romantics lovers kitchens cuisine . almost culinary cinderella story . you might enjoy these books : seduction cookbook diane brown ( baked salmon raspberry cabernet sauce , ideas late night seduction snacks information growing erotic herb garden . ) passionfruit cookbook patrick jesse pons-worley ( flavor passion fruit so seductive exotic . ) written spoon ( poetry recipes ) illustrated encyclopedia orchids alec pridgeon edible flower garden rosalind creasy intercourses : aphrodisiac cookbook ( " fig pastries " decadent naughty . ) movies food themes : babette feast like water chocolate scent green papaya my big fat greek wedding big night ~ rebecca review p.s. if you need recipe caramel iced eclairs entice someone , e-mail me my site . i can't believe they didn't publish cookbook go this movie , they still should !	1

if you expecting straight adaptation novel ' naked lunch ' you've come wrong place .. if you looking two styles converging into twisted bizarre sci-fi arthouse extravaganza - step right up .. david cronenberg ( fly , scanners , existenz , etc . ) unique attatchment surreal sci-fi investigations nature reality transformation ( i think i am miserably failing describe his cinema ) - burroughs also style which , shall we say , twists bounds reality -sometimes literally his drug induced descriptions ' naked lunch ' .. but mostly his radical prose style ( something james joyce aldous huxley but extra ingredient bizzare ) .. somehow this meeting two artists works out creates this frightening alternate noir-like alter-universe called interzone .. highlights movie include cronenberg strange puppetry which bring life burroughs creatures his own unconcious mind .. this beautiful movie look - one plays like fever-dream .. my only dissapointment i just read book - still so awe burroughs writing - i trouble excepting interpretation .. but cronenberg artistry actually enhances more than it detracts .	1
set bronx 1963 , wanderers focuses life several young gang members coming age . it surface wanderers may seem like nothing more than sytlish little ditty . but watch closely you'll find this movie existential masterpiece . ken wahl plays richie , handsome charismatic leader wanderers gang . ken juggles his friendships , loyalties , girlfriends , struggles maintain his italian gang position neighborhood . wanderers face threats wongs ( chinese gang ) , baldies ( greaser gang ) , irish gang black gang . but while all these gangs fight eachother , they fail recognize real threats their ethnic enclave end decade existential angst . always edge this movie threat duckie boys gang . movie never identifies ethnic identity duckie boys . instead viewer experiences them silent secret hoard white men emerging fog calm , placid psychotic smiles their faces . duckie boys seem number hundreds-a creepy mass nameless individuals . pivitol scene , wanderers blacks gathered football field throwdown-they see enemy eachother . but edge field ducky boys quietly gather , waiting strike . black , italian chinese band together fight this hoard angry psychotic white men which seem represent urban america-the america threatens swallow them all , force them assimilate leave behind their ethnic identities . threat end era cleverly disguised nina ( karen allen ) , hip beautiful hippie chick . richie enthralled her , but bound his italian girlfriend . he feels nina pull climatic scene they end up back richie car then discovered . ultimately richie returns his girlfriend forced marry her . but nina never really leaves his mind . we see richie his bachelor party he glimpses nina street . he follows her club where bob dylan ( real bob dylan according movie credits ) playing " times they changing " . richie doesn't go talk her , returns bachelor party swallowed up italians . indications he going " made man " , married daughter mafioso but their way life ending . 1970 approaching . nina no doubt go hip east villager richie settle into role he forced play life circumstances , never entering modern society . we left feeling like richie generation last it kind . this movie achieves violence without violent . viewers taste threat never quite know where it coming . characters acting this movie superb . plot subtle unique . it isn't your modern gang movie where drugs guns violence fireworks otherwise extremely dull movie	1

i've always liked this film even though it often dismissed critics because marketing " sensurround " sound film contained made you really feel quakes . most critics thought this hollow film focused gimmick . i disagree strongly . sound other special effects actually very groundbreaking , no pun intended , enhanced one experience film greatly . it huge hit when it came out . fact , even dvd you enjoy this special sound device simply upping bass and/or sub woofer your stereo . i 50 inch plasma television 5.1 dolby sound home theatre system i able recapture much theatre experience i when i first saw film 1974 . it freaked out my kids whom i didn't warn advance what i doing . they loved it . addition , other special effects top-notch still hold up even today . acting well-done all-star cast familar faces although script faulty times , it works well enough . one aspect i really appreciate this film it wasn't afraid kill off major characters we've grown like very much way " deep impact " . makes this disaster flick rather different than most genre . i highly recommend this film . even though this film great sound special effects , there no special features this dvd big disappointment . spite serious oversight , it worth owning you view this film many times . funny note : this film double-billed " towering inferno " once they called both films " shake bake " -- ya gotta appreciate humor	1
this ultimate collection any inxs fan . i love them much now , i eighties . some videos i never seen before , so makes it all better . video kiss dirt stands out me , because it filmed australian outback . what you need listen like thieves also unique videos . before they show each video , one members inxs tells you it , which i thought neat . there also live performances here which great . if you like inxs all , then you should definitely buy this	1

i thoroughly enjoyed " letters iwo jima " , standpoint well-crafted movie excellent acting performances casting , brilliantly subdued cinematography , haunting musical score . all respects , this thoughtful engrossing movie , imbued ever-present melancholy soldiers committed island battle they knew would their last . my only dissatisfaction " letters " , student military history wwii particular , decision downplay legendary ferocity 6 week conflict favor " behind-the-scenes " portrayals japanese soldier inner conflicts longings better times . i appreciate eastwood attempt remind us all human beings share similar longings home , family , peace- especially during surreal happenings war ..... but one should also remember much movie direction came letters written japanese soldiers iwo jima during conflict , unearthed many years later . all soldier letters , beginning time , reveal common threads humanity americans , japanese , germans , whatever .... but they also rarely dwell brutal harrowing realities conflict hand . all histories iwo jima i read , including many eye-witness accounts struggle , replete images ferocity struggle , tenacity japanese defenders , well unbelievable acts individual heroism both sides . 20,000 japanese sent iwo defend it last- somewhere neighborhood 1,000 or less survived . most rest died fighting . my only complaint " letters " it gave little sense struggle itself . it portrays defense mount suribachi almost walk park marines- though eye witness accounts rather different- top mountain fairly secure time marines reached summit famous flag raising(s ) , but several days before ones round-the-clock desperate fighting base mountain . many marine accounts recall those several days worst fighting they experienced whole pacific theatre . movie gives almost no sense . likewise , after suribachi fell , struggle went almost 6 more weeks , filled desperate cave-by-cave fighting , japanese resisting end . yes , there many ritual suicides documented marines(especially caves suribachi ) , but rest island two-way death struggle ultimately took 7,000 american lives . " letters " dwells bit too much " quiet moments " underground- my impression reading histories those moments precious few . movie honor humanity individual japanese soldier , but i think it also sells japanese soldier tenacity bravery quite short . letters recovered tell story , but only small part . letters never written tell story too . most 20,000 japanese soldiers iwo too busy write	1

6th day sheds light ( it should ) reality subsequently threat cloning . helicopter pilot not-so-distant future finds himself run powerful clone-producing corporation . arnold schwarzenegger rest cast truly outdone themselves their performances , which outstanding say least ! all actors , without exceptions , give it their 100% it really shows ( chemistry amazing) ! very well written very well presented , movie without doubt guaranteed provide more than just few thrills . setting , plot , dialogues , music all wonderful ! similarly movies like outbreak , day after tomorrow , island , lord war , blood diamond name few , 6th day draws attention some pretty important issues facing humanity . short , 6th day movie definitely worth watching one seriously consider adding your movie collection !	1
i very impressed objective treatment illegal immigrant situation arizona border . southern arizona resident , i've seen both sides issue first hand . if you concerned border , you likely find this movie informative . it portrays both sides , pro con stricter enforcement vs . amnesty . most importantly , it portrays human element . everyone border affected debate . debate if you , humans ( families , children , business owners ) environment ( range land , recreation areas ) affected . long time residents border towns fearful because limited support they security damage property litter constant people trafficing causes . many individuals groups concerned health safety those crossing into us . either way , safety , health problems , course , money all issues presented forefront this film . cries border portrays these concerns sympathy ( objectively ) both sides . i recommend this movie anyone who wishes present informed debate critical issues border security . it informs realistically gives insight into how critical this issue all us .	1

titanic compelling film real life story h.m.s. titanic . story detailed moving provides titanic lovers perspective agony suffering passengers this great ship endured during its last moments . those interested maritime safety or just interested knowing story behind titanic tragedy , this highly recommended movie . those not familiar history this great liner , brief narration may help . titanic launched belfast may 1911 . magazine time described it " practically unsinkable " . liner impressive its size features . she 269 metres long , 28 metres wide tall eleven storey building . luxury ship unique unparalleled time . among luxury features swimming pool first class passengers , first built liner . titanic set sail southampton 10 april 1912 . 14 april 1912 , look out man sounded alarm bells announced iceberg just ahead them . unfortunately , it too late ship collided iceberg within some few seconds , starboard side liner torn open seawater poured . sadly , there not enough lifeboats board only small fraction passengers ( largely those travelling first class ) rescued almost all those third class not rescued . ship band continued play during commotion followed stern ship rose high ship began sink . over 1500 people perished this accident . among critical lessons we learn this tragedy need effective safety management system . thankfully , many lessons learnt tragedy helped regulatory authorities , manufacturers ship owners come up design operational features made liners much safer .	1

i just couldn't believe how advanced these time they filmed . sure , you see strings holding up captain marvel while he flys , you even tell it dummy flying across screen . but it extremely well . story good starts expidition valley tombs where group people ( archeologists ? ) find hidden chamber tomb . hidden chamber one most powerful tools known man . golden scorpion , some lenses held it , it turn any regular object gold , or destroy any living thing existence . when they realize potential evil this item could , men divvy out lenses scorpion each other decide each hide his piece somewhere . same time , billy met old man who tells him he imbued power become captain marvel . however he told not abuse his powers , only use them stop scorpion . serial continues omnious scorpion brought life trying get all hidden pieces golden scorpion so he rule world ! thing i like this , previously stated , it 1941 , but doesn't adhere normal " super hero rules " . people die hands captain marvel ... but they deserved it ! saying , there course no really violent imagery . simply captain marvel doing stuff like throwing guys off top building or whatever . but you get idea . still good enough kids , i hardly wait show this my son when i get home	1
i rented this thinking it " place sun " ( also shelley winters)and so it took me bit not keep trying work story line into this one ( when he going push shelley off boat , i kept wondering ? ) :) anyway , once i adjusted fact this movie abused , lonely blind girl befriended black man , i found myself entranced lovely tale friendship forms under mutual adversity . gordon ( sidney poitier)helps blind selina move towards life independence freedom her mean , domineering mother ( winters ); selina offers gordon love friendship biased , racist world . takes no cheap shots offers no simplistic answers even better becaus . touching disturbing both . well worth locating watching	1
*** this comment may contain spoilers *** " manhunter " ( 1986 ) directed michael mann - masterpiece , pure simple . it took me five times but i finally realized it . i see it best adaptation favorite book written subject serial killers investigation their crimes . i also discovered william blake his fascinating art , including painting which gave book its title , " red dragon " , thanks mr. harris . michael mann certainly read book " red dragon " before he started work movie he able get inside it well book main character , graham able get inside murderer mind . scene where graham ( william peterson ) finds out who killer makes me shiver every time i watch movie . i not recall " moment truth " powerful convincing this one . it more powerful similar scene " sound lambs " where clarise starling figures out who where " buffalo bill " . michael mann took his time understanding how important scene it received royal treatment movie . i used disappointed mann cut book very impressive ending but after many viewings i think i understand why he it . me , whole movie build up " moment truth " scene after graham figured who murderer making us participants process , it not really matter ( least me ) how they going catch francis " red dragon " dolarhyde .	1
true most shows , first season ds9 ( seen hindsight ) actors groping bit their ultimate personality style seen later seasons . some interactions ( odo quark example ) seem bit over top compared nuances seen later seasons . still , there fair amount backstory covered this season makes later seasons more enjoyable watch . my opinion , ds9 first star trek franchise work more story arc than individual episodes could watched any order . quality dvd transfer not good later seasons ; likely they didn't preserve source material like today shows . softness/dirtiness picture what vhs tape would look like . not terrible , but not measuring up today dvd standards either	1

you say headache ? video editing switches multiple camera angles rate 1 camera every 2 seconds . you never get see anyone band " jam " out . i think editor wanted avoid boring just showing stage one camera , but result opposite extreme . it pretty much ruined perfect dvd me . band stellar audio incredible . i think it better turn tube off just crank speakers . or just buy cd . compare this death - live la you see what i mean	-1
we normally love dora explorer , but this video marred dangerous message -- i would not recommend buying it . dora encounters giant who tells her he sad b/c he lost his puppy she helps him find it encourages kids same . hello ?! other reviewers noted , such stories used ploys predators lure children . although i used opportunity tell my 5 year old dora actually not make safe choice there she should never anything like , young children so impressionable i wish she not seen it first place	-1

kids ( 2yrs 4 yrs ) love little people stories playsets . this same quality stories they love it . my daughter i bit dissapointed 2 stories those we received vhs came small barn " discovering animals farm " ( leaving only 2 other stories vhs ) . i guess i just wish fisher price it way blues clues . they added episodes vhs " bonus " episodes . ( you could least get rid tape ! ) i also don't like menu set-up dvds . it would great if all 10 episodes would play through instead 5 episodes each selection . these my only gripes though . fisher price little people stories great otherwise	1

poetic , beautiful hypnotic . series short vignettes lushly evoke some kurosawa dreams/visions . must anyone interested history classic films , and/or visual art . i use portions art appreciation class , context artists creating work out inner experiences or subconscious . it well received	1
while this movie wasn't deep-arguably is-it creative , unique , quite realistic . if you pay close attention dialogue it predictable especially if you like figure things out before they happen . willard carroll left just enough room make you wonder then certain revelations-unless you're out it-are expected not surprising . characters believable acting entire cast nothing short sensational . if you get confused easily , stick it out , comes together very nicely end . side note-two things : 1 . how excellent gillian anderson ability show range . don't get me wrong , love dana scully , i , however , she unsung hero when it comes this art . ( see her masterpiece theater bleak house . ) 2 . it my opinion most comedians stick comedy there but few when they transition or give drama try excellent job . said hats off jon stewart . his performance more than respectable .	1
not only this great show my daughter , but i loved it too . i remember it when i child .	1
ok , so this isn't best sci-fi movie ever but it really fun , if you get into it . this adventure looks like cross " road warrior " " alien " it tells story bounty hunter wolfe(peter strauss , tring hard but just not han solo ) landing planet ravaged plage rescue three ladies who crashed there held hostage strangest villian ever overdog(michael ironside(looking like borg grade ham) ! young molly ringwald hand ernie hudson help strauss get girls back . slow places some really strange encounters planets other citizens make it mixed bag , but i said if you get into spirit fun you may find you like this one also ! give it try !	1
i agree reviewer who mentioned unfinished subplots unexplained sequences . i gave this movie chance because i am huge john candy fan never heard it , but , i know often , sleeper movies buried gems just waiting found ( la benny joon)but this wasnt one them im afraid . i found this movie mildly amusing , john candy very well but overall , movie doesnt hold up his other movies . ending dissapointing there too many , above mentioned , unfinished subplots . there supposed some sort development john larroquette sequence ? really pointless addition other than give family somewhere go while candy learned his sailing yeah , what wrong popcorn ? i loved you john candy i miss you dearly , you'll always place my heart , however , this movie probably never watched again . i see you again , planes , trains automobiles .	-1
i first heard lee ritenour when i started listening fourplay . before then , i didn't really listen much jazz . friend got me hooked pat metheny , it all started there . this dvd important contribution any jazz fan collection . it spans ritenour career 70s now , it it featuring not only music but also people he played . atmosphere not what i thought it would : rather than " this lee ritenour , these people who i decided allow play me this project , " it " these people good their own right : i brought them here celebrate history , make little well . " dvd also not extended guitar solo . it very much lee ritenour friends . interaction artists this setting amazing watch . fact they all improvise so well , stay close theme piece , bring everything back together when it time says lot quality musicians ritenour assembled this project . dave grusin , ernie watts , patrice rushen , anthony jackson more - these not just studio musicians hired make one man look good . whole this case indeed greater than sum it parts . some standout moments dvd : * set featuring brazilian music ivan lins , including " harlequin . " * ritenour hand-punishing " captain fingers . " * my personal favorite : rendition miles davis ' " blue green . " when i 10 , i used listen am station washington dc played jazz every friday saturday night midnight six morning . this song reminded me lot songs i used listen transistor radio under my pillow . interviews included add lot historical value dvd set . this can't stressed enough - this dvd some long-term value people who serious fans jazz , because way it covers 30-year span time . it also great collection someone whose jazz collection looking bit thin , because right here you see hear some great talent . it clear after 30 years playing jazz , lee ritenour hasn't lost step . this collection proves it , highly recommended	1

" little britain " ( season one ) , me , extremely funny show . until i purchased this dvd , i not familiar this series , i'm certainly , now , very ardent fan . series sketches very well written acted matt lucas david walliams . my god , they so very funny playing all major roles . typical british , aforesaid includes female roles too . " drag " roles seem bring out best matt lucas david walliams . i love almost impossible understand , fast talking , chain smoking , incorrigible --" yeah but no but yeah , shut-up " -- vicky pollard who finds herself , most time , wrong side law . i also really like pudgy , extremely rude ( other fatties ) very condescending marjorie dawes -- leader " fat fighters " . ( her best advise " fat challenged " they eat all dust they want ! ) most all , i adore emily howard unsuccessful transvestite . he tries convince everyone comes within his sights he " real " lady . yes , all named characters played wonderfully matt lucas david walliams . humorous introductions each sketch given resounding voice tom baker which very funny indeedabove , i've named just few my favorites . there many more . if you prude , don't bother this show ; it bound offend you . however , if you like really funny british humor boarders obscene some might consider bad taste ( i don't ) , buy this show ; me it really hysterical .	1
last year , longrunning detective series " monk " ( obsessie-compulsive detective ) got paired new show , lighthearted comedy-mystery series kooky faux-psychic who solves crimes . together , these shows even more delightful , charmingly eccentric characters some very nice writing . fifth season " monk " opens movie made monk ( tony shalhoub ) life amazing abilities , well-known actor david ruskin ( stanley tucci ) monk . but ruskin turns out world best method actor , he observes monk doing his detective work -- starts acquire monk ocd personality . but monk problems don't cease when he paralyzed garbage strike , strike leader murdered . other cases include mysterious electrocution gym shower , blinded murderer , stint private eye , college reunion , disastrous rock concert , leper , marijuana , radio host whose wife died while he air , he competes against technology find serial killer . end monk hour comes time shawn spencer ( james roday ) his long-suffering pal gus ( dulï¿½ hill ) . shawn strict , humorless dad coached him since early childhood perfect future cop -- hyperobservant , highly intelligent , perfect detective . but when he reports his observations police , they arrest him -- his only way out pretend psychic . fact , his gimmick works brilliantly -- soon he sets up shop psychic , after plucking gus dull job . among their colourful cases : death spelling bee , haunting sorority house , wedding tainted theft murder , ghostly stalking , cat used witness , civil war reenactments , comic book convention , alien abductions , underground poker , organizing surprise birthday party lassiter . " monk " " psych " lot common . they're both hyperobservant eccentrics , they both solid mysteries some hilarious writing , although monk tends rather sadder tone , compared frothy twentysomething hijinks gus shawn . seen together , these shows seem like two kind . but whatever differences , they both colourful mysteries ( sometimes unexpected twists ) , some deliciously strange dialogue , whether it monk depressed ( " i wish i drank . it wonderful ? " ) or shawn flailing pretending psychic ( " spare me ! spare me ! auuuwwwww ! " ) . comedy , we get see what shaped characters into who they . granted , neither series quite perfect -- monk ocd becomes rather cartoonish few episodes , such his nutty reaction his shrink retiring . mysteries shawn gus solve take little while suitably mysterious -- middle season , they both fun suspenseful , such whole speed-dating episode . leads both shows absolutely delightful -- tony shalhoub hysterical ( such when he tries butler ) , but also heartbreaking , such when monk watches his old wedding video . roday , other hand , just hilarious comic actor . his shawn devoid responsibility or dignity , he rides through luck -- but he good heart , genuinely good detective . both shows great supporting casts , especially hill long-suffering gus , traylor howard monk nurse-sidekick . all cops -- including gray-stanford ormondson -- get plenty character development . they some celebrity appearances : " psych " george takei , while monk some small , hilarious roles alice cooper tucci . sean astin gives glorious performance murderous , spoiled rich brat . fifth season " monk " helped first season " psych " get off ground . these smartly-written , humorous mystery series well-paired , both definitely worth getting	1

this movie started off promising atmosphere which hinted fun thrills come , but let horribly down laughable special effects , paper-thin clichï¿½'d characters some cringingly awful acting . students ( blonde bimbo , geeky nerd sincere young thing crush stereotypical workaholic prof ) heading off their jeep into wilderness certainly potential , but any attempts build creepy atmosphere isolation diluted spoiled intrusion weak pointless sub-plot army special forces unit battling against insurgents . this military operation ( think arnie team predator meets marines aliens ) gives coolio stage strut his stuff . but , i'm sorry say , convincing he ain't . obliged join forces students , remainder film basically series action set-pieces which humans battle it out pterodactyls . ensuing gore laid very ott style reminiscent evil dead series ( but nowhere near stylish ) creates few ( unintended ? ) laughs . 18 rating certainly undeserved too - there far more effective scary 15 out there . even straight dvd `b ' movies go , this pretty poor fare . final scene hints sequel - they really shouldn't bother	-1

i love david lynch , guy so brilliant unique . every single one his movies masterpiece , even though most people don't understand what going . this dvd set we're treated several his short films ; some made while he college , one while he making ' eraserhead ' , one after ' blue velvet ' , one late nineties . make it even better , there introduction each film lynch himself . he talks them , but he doesn't explain them , which cool ... but it would also cool hear explanation him . anyway first film called " six men getting six ( six times ) " which painting he morphed into 3 minute short movie . combined sound siren , it fascinating unique . second short film " alphabet , " which star lynch then wife peggy very creepy 4-minute creation . introduction , lynch actually explains how he got idea . next short film " grandmother , " which he made grant he given american film institute . thing virtually no dialogue makes no sense , but images flash across screen ( young boy plants seed his bed grows grandmother ) very creepy . i think it little too long though . " amputee " features two versions , shot two different kinds black white stock ... well , odd . it like we're suddenly eavesdropping girl who legs amputated . she writing letter aboutt something we no knowledge , while doctor messes her legs which begin shooting some kind liquid . creepy , but not disturbing . next up " cowboy frenchmen " which complete change pace ... it comedy stars harry dean stanton (' wild heart ' ) , jack nance (' eraserhead ' ) , dude you see bunch movies like ' erin brockovich ' ' twin peaks . ' film says lot culture , while stupid but very funny . then we finale , 55-second short called " lumiere . " despite short , it very clever one lynch creepiest creations . this not dvd casual lynch fans . if there david lynch movie you hated , then you not like this movie . people who think eraserhead his best movie definitely love this . people who like mulholland dr. blue velvet no doubt find this interesting . while it not most entertaining dvd market , i enjoyed it immensely . grade : a-	1

i saw this during its theatrical release loved it . when i purchased boxed set peckinpah westerns , it first i played . how it held up ? i would given it five stars back then ; today just four ( which ain't shabby ) . difference represents effect 30+ years my sensibilities more than theatrical viewing versus dvd . cast features excellent performances : jason robards perfect cable ; david warner effective preacher ; peckinpah stalwarts strother martin , . . jones , slim pickins always interesting . clunker , me , stella stevens . whore-with-a-heart-of-gold character type which i problem . it not problem morality ; it problem reality . problem here compounded choice miss stevens . it not her acting - her performance quite good - it her appearance . while scruffy appearances other characters place them plausibly turn-of-the-century arizona , miss stevens appearance screams 1960s southern california . i would found less attractive actress harder edge more effective role . problem here may mine alone ( miss stevens performance widely praised ); i viewed movie more fantasy , miss stevens would not posed problem she . overall , it quibble what otherwise immensely enjoyable film	1

" roots , rock , reggae " documentary showing snapshot reggae music jamaica 1976 . reggae fan , this film offers unadulterated , unique glimpse into island environments fostered one greatest musical genres 20th century . filmmakers show how where music recorded , where it sold , concert footage . more importantly than actual music , this film focuses social cultural roots jamaica national music . they show how it grew crushing poverty areas like trenchtown , its link rastafarianism , how it inexorably linked jamaican politics . features footage lee perry work his black ark studio ( before he burned it down ); interviews jimmy cliff joe higgs ; original concert footage u-roy , gladiators , mighty diamonds , abyssinians , ( very early ) inner circle . film segment bob marley , but not concentrate extensively godfather reggae . course , quality film crude even 1970s standards , but so some greastest reggae ever made - not make it not good ! those interested reggae roots should also check out books " reggae bloodlines , " " reggae explosion : story jamaican music , " " people funny boy " lee perry biography .	1

i not really know what expect when i went see this film . i aware it one biggest grossing french films box office france all time , mysterious beast terrorised french countryside 1760s . i went see it suburban cinema younger members audience sneering french accents subtitles . not last very long , however , because film soon utterly engrossed them , indeed , it myself . samuel le bihan plays adventurer/naturalist who attached royal court versailles . he sent rural region france try trap elusive beast which now responsible increasing number killings . accompanying him his quest ' half brother'- mani ( played veteran martial arts films - mark dacascos . two made welcome chateau local aristocrat there they begin their ques t.t he film not really fall into any genre but draws number . throw martial arts fights , superstitious peasants , beast looks like relative monster ' relic ' , packs wolves , deformed madman , plots overthrow monarchy , you idea what expect .... director christopher gans ( silent hill)has made beautifully photographed multi layered film here . film progresses , gradually reality what going becomes apparent . cinematography superb - particular forest snow sequences which almost enchanted/magical feel them . cast all superb play out their roles relish . film brutal places not hold back gore . indeed , some younger film goers who earlier sneering , becoming quite upset agitated hunting sequences which graphically depict culling local wolves . this unique film well worth look . don't expect it fall into any category though but instead prepare something very different	1
