they spend first half this movie saying how great ultimate warrior . journey awesome ! then all sudden , paid wwe guys just began bad-mouth warrior . maybe he questionable judgment - but why they trying make us feel bad someone we loved ? they take some very low blows . they say warrior bad wrestler . actually he seemed just fine me when i young , i really can't distinguish one ability other . they just all gang up him make outragious allegations . vince says quickly reason why ultimate disappeared 3 years because he failed drug test . soon he says this , they fade black then come back new issue . what drug use ? which drugs ? presumably they're talking steroids . but what high mighty hulk hogan his admitted drug use . let not talk - let just keep ganging up warrior . they completely ridicule him changing his name warrior . they also just try badmouth him so much . who cares none wrestlers liked him ? i don't! he excited heck out me way more than any dorks who say bad things him -including hulk . oh yeah - they don't even let warrior defend himself . why i find out imdb.com he asked appear but declined ? why don't they address this ? this " docu " more slanted than " fahrenheitt 911 " every wrestling ultimate warrior fan start out loving this docu then hating it . it just leaves you bitter taste your mouth , tired all whining bitter trash talking .	-1
what huge disappointment this release . i suspecting it wouldn't all great when i saw studio originally produced this show , 20th century fox , same video company releasing it . well , first season looks horrible . source material all 16mm dupe prints , some parts which out focus , scratched dirty . all cases image soft , well , like 16mm . compared what fox releasing voyage bottom sea , produced same year ( 1964 ) same studio boone , this release nothing short disgrace . we should given pristine 35mm source material , we're not . i suspect fox wouldn't release original camera negs it vaults without substantial fee . anyway , season one daniel boone isn't worth buying . i haven't seen season two , when show started filming color , but i'm now afraid look	-1
i high hopes this series when i started watching it , though i guess nonstop obscenities should tip off under all visual masterwork spiritually stunning characterizations there lurked twisted message wasted ten hours my life discover . shandala truly wonderful character , pure good , characterization her very tender , so episode 21 or so storyline actually looked like it could end hopeful uplifting . oh , how wrong me think so , because all philosophical religious trappings , message " hope " marketers promise characters learn end villain demented plan save world really more effective than their spiritualities " truth " emotional physical torture destruction innocent , good woman only way save world ! spare me . if you think i am disgusted this message , just imagine what muslims think when they see what becomes all quoting koran muslim character final opinions . although story technically good , i'm only giving it one star message despair .	-1

film seems focus 70 punk exclusively . anything post-1980 glossed over , clumped together generally viewed dissapointment this " documentary " . i think film well documenting roots punk , seeing how letts steeped scene time ( although misfits weren't mentioned , which i found odd ) . interviews henry rollins jello biafra great well . however , order claim documentary , evolution punk rock just integral ( perhaps more so ) its origins . i think , basically , letts based film his own opinions , likes dislikes instead actually documenting punk . i disapointed .	-1

while this certainly isn't best pearl jam concert ever it isn't worst either . first disc starts little slow .. but you can't argue getting hear song like " my tree " " faithfull " . highlights : love boat captain ... nice opener . one best riot act song sure . my tree , one , if not my favorite pj songs . not quite rocking 2000 tour performances but still great . gimme some truth . maybe not technically perfect perfomance but heartfelt passionate . good john lennon cover . even flow . always great . spin black circle ... band starts get more into show after this rocking performance . thumbing my way ... just great slow song . breath . my opinion best performance show ... just great . crown thorns . i really like this version song ... played well whether you think ed should sing it or not . baba o'reilly . classic " who " song . great performance . just try sit still during this one . i would reccomend this dvd anyone pearl jam fan already but if you're not then i would start some their studio albums first .	1
alfred hitchcock second film after brought america david o . selznick suspicion , which he made while loan rko pictures . his first hollywood flick , rebecca , he put joan fontaine very good use ultimately these two films made her into star . fontaine won best actress academy award her portrayal lina mclaidlaw , bookish innocent ( but wealthy ) young woman who gets swept off her feet caddish johnnie aysgarth ( cary grant ) . after their quick courtship marriage against her father wishes , lina begins see johnnie who he really -- penniless leech -- but she naively continues love him nonetheless . johnnie charm ostensible , yet his irresponsible ways increasingly becoming inexcusable . lina trust eventually gives way suspicion when she begins believe he might go any length pay off his mounting debts . hitchcock masterfully builds suspense this movie manages maintain it duration picture . movie only flaw its tacked-on seemingly contrived final scene which , we told , due either mr. grant popularity during these years or existence production code effect hollywood time . hitchcock wanted darker ending but , we see here , he lost battle . however , he not give completely some would us believe . ending remains ambiguous enough allow us project either happy or sinister conclusion according our own sensibilities . suspicion classic hitchcock . grant fontaine turn masterful performances nigel bruce irresistible dimwitted loveable " beaky , " johnnie old chum . flawed ending prevents placing suspicion top any list hitchcock achievements , but it fine film nevertheless i only give it my highest recommendation . jeremy . forstad	1

story gets bit complicated because it deals little bit law issues . real problem most us get kind frightened when we face something unusual our daily lives . i watch movie end twice order understand well how bad guys going punished . i wonder what lawyers , fbi agents mafia members would think when watching this movie . most us don't know much legal issues but still interested thrillers , this movie shows rather believable very fun plot . good guy , mitch mcdeere , wins over evil not only because he smart but also because big deal good luck . mitch so lucky story strains credibility . example , mitch wife gets know all sudden gene hackman character ( who important documents copy ) not going dive mitched though so she saves days showing up distract him . well , good luck tends favor people drive real life . same time movie shows legal procedures made-up real life lawyer john grisham . movie also realistic way bad guys punished . real life white-collar criminals hardly ever go jail , even less killed good guys ; everybody knows this . what not everybody knows these crooks still face problems . movie shows sort legal money problems they get involved into . finally , suspense well organized . moreover piano instrumental music goes really well those scenes . yes , this very compelling movie recommend watching . beware this movie deals some degree conservative vs liberal cultural war . bad guys southern conservatives who want rule other people lives according their own hypocrite standards . meanwhile good guys liberals ne . i wondered how writer john grisham could portray his own southern fellows negative ways . all i guess jg realized what would accepted entertainment industry wrote according it . anyways , this just movie it what it supposed : entertain	1

what challenge ! take two characters like aliens predators invent new story could make them meet more than challenge . it unimaginable . each one better than what they before yet both together even more dramatic formidable than each one may ever . then you keep human beings real center film , those who really going transfer their fear onto us , audience . situation believable allow no single minute respite or lack tension . film-makers behind this adventure revisited their good old mythology books ransacked backshop store known � old curiosity shop � . so we revisit pyramid civilizations ( three : aztec , egyptian cambodian ) great myth all times : antarctica which all these pryramid civilizations supposed come . then they revisited all stories ranting raving some space visitors who would taught animals homo erectus species how become homo sapiens . general idea space-visitors predators , aliens prisoners pyramid two thousand feet under ice antarctica every one hundred years some young predators sent earth hunt these aliens pyramid . course some human beings accept sacrificial victims whom aliens going born , hunt . easy since these human beings old not yet homo sapiens but only homo erectus . that what we told happened october 10 , 1904 going happen again october 10 , 2004 . unluckily some crazy human beings get way hunt . way lucky since these human beings set whole machinery pyramid work they become sacrificial victims who carry aliens life . course things not going go exactly way it planned predators . result absolutely perfect . human beings going reluctant resisting victims one manage go beyond simple hostility disgust help predators , hence saving world human race . details discovered film itself which spectacular . it reveals vanity human beings who get into adventure without even knowing what it all without any proper preparation . all those vain people who believe money , guns , science or whatever get end their vanity only survivor one who best prepared also least vain , so little vain her enemy my enemy my friend . this dangerous principle led many people into unbearably absurd situations incalculably lethal uncontrollable consequences . but times it safe believe it it safe practice it . though when first round finished my enemy who enemy my enemy my friend alliance defeat this common enemy goes back his basic definition becomes my enemy again war goes one more round . film-makers decided not go direction but genetically cross alien predator sequel some day few years tried tested first comic book , i guess . dvd numerous very interesting extra resources which quite welcome . dr jacques coulardeau , university paris dauphine university paris 1 pantheon sorbonn	-1

oscar nominee john travolta ( best actor , pulp fiction ) lovely scarlett johansson ( match point ) star this slow paced adaptation novel " off magazine street " ronald everett capps . movie features underappreciated performance travolta , who captures character bobby long perfectly . it mature performance travolta miles away any character he played before . movie pursy ( johansson ) , young 18-year old who lives florida boyfriend . when pursy hears her estranged mother lorraine died , she travels new orleans go funeral . problem , funeral few days earlier ; so pursy travels house lorraine left her find two men . one bobby long ( travolta ) , former english professor who now old drunk . other bobby protege lawson ( gabriel macht ) , who writing novel bobby doesn't seem going anywhere . pursy finds out lorraine left house two all three them , but instead leaving she decides live both men despite their misgivings . movie movies like memoir , there no particularly big events occur . it moves slowly , like life . there few turns events occur , but none them big enought warrant calling it " twist " . besides travolta wonderful performance , johansson perfect pursy . i would say this her best performance it would if not movie " match point " . not everyone like this movie , many find it dull stupid ; but this mature , sweet , fairly entertaining movie . seeing johansson half-naked wasn't bad either . i don't know how helpful this review convincing person see this movie , but i bought it 5 dollars wal-mart so it won't tragic loss if you don't like it much . grade : a-	1

i always find it fascinating when i see people praising classic films yet when i watch them , i don't know what point . one those films ended up terry gilliam brazil . while visually cool , story-wise it kind boring i didn't really care characters which course big no-no . same fear loathing las vegas which i watched sober , so maybe big difference . nearly every weed smoking/beer drinking friend i town praises film . so we come 12 monkeys which i liked it so far one my favorites he . it year 2035 5 billion people died thanks virus unleashed army 12 monkeys , group people who infected world 1996 1997 . cole , inmate " volunteers " travel 1996 obtain pure sample since it long since mutated hopes engineering cure . however they sent him 1990 even worse , his rant ravings future viruses mankind near extinction gets him thrown nuthouse . what erupts there quite enthralling sure keep your brain their toes ... so speak . one thing i always love these kind films how certain things future get explained such literal writings wall phone messages it gets involving mentally , maybe bit too much so . while i didn't get confused , some scenes probably just fly over people heads leave them disoriented . especially its ending which i won't spoil while i figure it out what it , other parts i'm like " hey wait minute , what ...? " bruce willis , well maybe mark wahlberg orlando bloom , what i call " william hurt " factor : no matter how good their performance(or bad case bloom occasional wahlberg ) , they always sound so bored . however , this film arguably one bruce best . surprisingly it also one brad pitt , playing jeffrey goines , man who , box puts it mildly , few cards short full deck . then there madeleine stowe who i always liked films she but i rarely see her . while there other actors film , such david morse christopher plummer , it primarily these 3 get center attention . while i wouldn't necessarily buy 12 monkeys unless someone bought it me , it certainly quite enjoyable film its own right	1
" con express " lots action it , which great because this hides poor writing uninteresting characters . unfortunately , action isn't enough , stunt pieces shoot-outs , audience tempted doze off . city heat productions isn't really known producing films highest quality , so usually i go easy them . if this big-budget company producing this , i'd inclined pan it entirely . but i wasn't expecting much got little more than i bargained . action , most part , pretty good but nothing competitive your usual dumb action movie . flanery vosloo perfectly casted , but everyone else seems stiff add any more flow movie . vosloo especially appears enjoying himself over-the-top bad guy hijacking train containing deadly chemicals . film moves fast contains shades better movies like under siege 2 , con air , spy game , speed . if you liked those , you probably won't mind this one too much . just go easy it	-1

before i review , i'd like clear something up : i am very latecomer seeing this movie . i introduced ghost shell franchise through new anime series airing adult swim , ghost shell : standalone complex . i absolutely love show , so i figured eventually i'd get around seeing movie , which i knew full well shares no connection show . they're both seperate interperetations comic series same name , ( which i not read , so i don't know which more accurate ) but tv series exponentially better than this movie almost every concievable way . there many things i don't like this movie , biggest poor pacing . plot movie actually surprisingly straightforward once you cut away all filler , but that biggest problem . there not really enough story last full-length feature , because it seems almost like it originally written intention 30 minute short . since they didn't budget load movie up action scenes ( there barely any , they aren't very impressive most part ) they slow story down drawn out conversations you won't understand more than 60% , camera shots last what feels like minutes where we're looking either nothing , or woman nipples . that not cinematic artistry , that either lazy or perverted . animation itself isn't even good , especially considering this theatrical release only 10 years ago . it choppy , there not really whole lot detail ( except when it comes women nipples ) . looking just animation , if i didn't know better , i'd thought this movie ova 1980 . only thing i really say i liked this movie it ghost shell . it probably kind like how i didn't see 1989 batman movie until years after i'd spoiled batman animated series , couldn't bring myself like it any reason other than it batman . everything tv series superior this movie : animation , stories , character developement , production values ... i could go entire page how much better tv series . short , if you're you're all interested gits franchise , yourself favor rent dvds tv show instead . you'll find lot love , but i can't say same movie . my dream someday alex proyas give us gits movie lives up what i would hope after watching standalone complex	-1

i really liked this dvd . hard it watch all painful memories it brings flooding back into forefront consciousness . callous cold hearted indifferent nastiness reagan administration those it considered lesser americans lay hospitals suffering dying . this dvd shows dr gallo shallow man vaccuous heart lacking anything remotely akin human compassion unless course camera rolling . film shows cdc headed political hacks who elevated collected arts administrative spin control , reckless indifference suffering \ death people it not like stonewalling stuff mythic legend . while dvd shows ugliest demons human heart laid bare whole world might see it also shares most humane tender moments early days before hiv / aids got those names . film showed how even one america darkest hours when true presidental leadership asleep switch , little people those deep inside government all they could protect public health living up highest standards onr called offer themselves service our nation . dvd simply told truth it left pretty much viewer make up his or her own mind what they think those times . there some moving facts end dvd all now quite dated . i guess thing caught me so totally off guard running tally showing numbers sick dying people earliest days epidemic . it so sad how reagan adminstration so viciously sat its hands doing nothing while so many died epidemic it might not stopped but it might slowed significantly it only acted same fortitude home it mustered beruit or libia . yes i dwell too much sickening aspects those times because just seeing it again after lived through it makes me mad . seeing this dvd just convinces me we real leader white house when aids hiv grid gay cancer first burst onto scene things might not so grim . but this dvd so much more than venom pain loss it also highlights human kind its best . there much love this dvd balanced grim realities day . back day i not say i front lines , because indeed i not . i think this movie must anyone collection its current price it not beat . course i brought copy might buy spare lend out teaching purposes . this dvd pretty accurate hiv history it should told	1

what filth . what utter tripe . if early 90 didn't enough " white people bad , everyone else good " movies , comes this sick , unimaginative , racist garbage . i see ratings many viewers like this movie ( some whom appear unable spell most primitive words english language offer ) . let me ask you wannabe vatos locos this .... if this movie white people instead latino people , would you thought this movie racist ? think it ... white people starting gangs street prison based principle outkilling outbreeding other races people ? oh , but when non-white people it , suddenly it not racist . more bs hollywood double-standard bigoted drivel . way , how your vatos locos movement doing ? hmm ? it producing successful members society , or just more fodder prison gang rape ? exactly . you racist , degenerate losers back then , you're racist , degenerate losers now . though i doubt you'll ever learn . vatos locos forever ! ha ha ha ha ha what absolute joke . what insult humanity . grow up	-1
after his devastating demolishing m.a.s.h. , altman returns very smart picture . you should not forget how altman totally involved certain premises considered untouchables ; he made splendid film titled mccabe mrs. miller 1973 eventually he would round off his fabulous " three women " 1977 , considered his most bergmanian work . magisterial use country music just attractive facade explore carve relief lot basic profiles american people . there so much see analyze underneath . solid film became loved cult film since its immediate release .	1
this " movie " , which obviously meant pilot but aired stand-alone feature , lacks nearly everything made babylon 5 great show . it set same universe contains same races ships , but plotting feels like , well , failed pilot . g'kar scenes " rangers " embarassment character . after spectacular sendoff original b5 series , he re-enters universe apparently regressed two or three seasons ' worth character development . there no reason him present except spout off some gratuitous quotes babylon 5 remind us we watching b5 show . overall , this show would without much value if it stood alone . episode b5 mythos , it worth even less	-1

critics lambasted kirk douglas ' performance " hammy " . i don't see all . this , without doubt , vincent van gogh we read " letters theo " miraculously brought life . van gogh actual life , whole thing kind creaking bipolarity it ; he periods creative bliss , happiness fulfillment , but they too short his almost unbearable intensity gets him into trouble too often too many people who help him . anthony quinn paul gaughan would seem like strange fit , but he pulls it off pretty well ; you feel arguments crashing them like thunderstorms , vincent unwavering belief their friendship so innocent enthusiastic one cannot help but feel heartbroken when it ends so terribly . douglas communicates vividly what we suspect van gogh reading his correspondences , his paintings ; he far too visionary ever really make it practical world , or overcome his restlessness long enough allow his art mature . beginning film more than any other sequence shows how violently alienated van gogh coteries social mores . his doomed-from-the-start mission minister ends ironically -- he too christian christians . while there explosion underground poverty-stricken children die very miner who introduced him their real hellish existence , he reprimanded his spiritual " superiors " dressing incorrectly . van gogh so enraged this he screams just what he thinks them , loses all chance path life . throughout film he remains christian , but he too much self-absorbed passionate artist always retain his ethics . douglas ' van gogh stick no situation or person very long : only constant thread his life his passion painting . sometimes performance so good we feel van gogh landmine madness coarsing through screen even empathize those who reject him because fiery nature could really scary times . we get chance see van gogh paintings way we never before , which probably best part this movie . his relationship his long suffering brother theo , played superbly james donald . he should gotten nomination best supporting actor , not anthony quinn , who turns roughly same performance every movie happened get lucky this one . somewhere inside him he knows his brother genius , but he still flesh blood van gogh deal financially otherwise . ending could not remotely powerful it without him . this film , despite concerning man titanic imagination , also good realistic attack myth tortured artist something romantic envied . barring his moments vision , van gogh life hell sorts led him miserable death . this nothing envy or emulate this movie communicates . still , beautifully must see anyone who wants understand one greatest painters ever live .	1

we're deep into formula now computer animated films -- over hedge one most tired bunch . anyone say buzz woody ? chicken run ? exterminator stock villain cgi movies -- almost identical vintage toy collector toy story 2 . how many times you a-bomb joke ... worse still dialogue , painfully unfunny one-liners , see-saw animation either dull or like pinball machine sight gags explosions . it clear each these animators trying outdo one , once again we see cleverly-disguised lack locations -- or interest . there must nothing easier craft render than endless rows geometric homes single proscenium forest . this film by-the-numbers piece merchandising very little genuine artistry .	-1
longtime fan batman comics , i definite ideas what batman movie should . i am pleased report batman begins pretty close my definition good batman movie - it certainly first incarnation live-action batman i would recommend friends . story - millionaire heir bruce wayne witnesses his parents deaths hands mugger . he ends up wandering world looking purpose comes across formidable enigmatic ra al ghul , head centuries-old organisation dedicated cleaning up corruption decadance ( they claim caused sack rome , example ) . he trains variety martial arts , returning gotham city ( fictional city " nyc nj " ) start his life crimefighting . his first target - mob kingpin carmine falcone . his second mission - save gotham ra's mad plan raze city example world . true batman fan , plot not so important execution . luckily designers batsuit understood batman not tank plods through badguys , but stealth fighter than surgically picks off baddies one-by-one , maximising fear remaining undetectable . same token , this batsuit flexible enough bale use martial arts moves not look awkward , unlike his film predecessors . similarly , new batmobile humvee-like military vehicle obviously take damage thrown it ( opposed suped-up corvette ) . also vital importance batman story incorporation his origin surrounding minor characters . just recent spider-man films incorporated large cast supporting characters pinned his personality his origin story , so too this batman film . this gives it richness depth vital its believability ( if such thing even possible superhero film ! ) . i especially pleased see big-screen debut lt . gordon corrupt bullying partner , det . flass . similarly , gordon himself , alfred , ra , scarecrow ( jonathan crane ) , etc . all used good effect here . unfortunately , there some nitpicking problems film . starters , where this character rachel ( played katie holmes ) come ? there perfectly good d.a. batman mythos ( harvey dent ) , why invent new one ? similarly , if female character needed endangered , why not vicki vale ? surely investigative reporter get into much trouble crime lord d.a. could . missing character ra's daughter talia . finally , ( spoiler alert !! ) batman fans very upset his greatest nemesis ( except possibly joker ) dies end film . fans comic know ra immortal - perhaps talia drag his body back lazarus pit revive him ? we actually see liam neeson again ? biggest complaint i , though , balance action detective work . me , batman sort cross bruce lee sherlock holmes . this film gone entirely bruce lee side left out sherlock holmes . granted , young impetuous batman would probably prefer busting heads careful csi-like forensic investigation . i only hope overseers warner bros . don't fall into trap making unending series action films , which would quickly get boring . detective work , if well , would welcome necessary aspect maintaining interest franchise . this special edition set most interesting due inclusion comic book . it contains few stories different eras batman comics , give reader overview evolution comic character . dvd extras themselves pretty standard only mildly interesting . they include featurettes new batmobile , development batsuit , etc	-1
labyrinth delightful movie fantasy fun all ages enjoy . this always one my favorite films , going back it adult only makes me enjoy appreciate it all more . jennifer connelly gives superb performance sarah , main character , whose baby brother taken goblin king ( david bowie one his best characters - who ironically gives often sensitive human performance while fanciful fantastic same time ; he wrote performed all music , which also some his best work ) . sarah must leave her world make-believe enter very real deceptive labyrinth save her brother time before he turned into goblin . way , we encounter large cast jim henson puppet-creatures , some which become sarah friends helpers her journey . puppets so believable you soon forget they not real people . movie filled magic , both off screen . film supplemented this dvd " making-of " documentary - original feature , narrated largely jim henson himself - made during actual production film ( released 1986 ) . such documentary makes one appreciate even more what goes into movie like this how complex creatures - what goes into their creation , how they operate , how they interact sets other characters ( especially this case live actors ) . it lot fun see this " inside " look , more than anything gives real sense who jim henson how much this all really meant him . my favorite quote jim henson this documentary when he said ( his inspiration motivation when he makes movie ) , " when i go see film , when i leave theater ... i like happier than i when when i went , i like leave up feeling , i like picture sense substance , life things matter me , " - wonderful sentiment remember this day age . lighthearted , fun , fantastical , funny , beautiful , exciting , more " real " than many today " realities " - extremely enjoyable uplifting . added bonus , monty python member terry jones wrote script ( interviewed documentary ) . cheryl mcfadden ( star trek : tng beverly crusher ) also all choreography film ( both humans puppets ) . : -	1

i high hopes this movie . alas it wasted sentiment . it started off very s-l-o-w . it great premise . aging don juan gets mysterious letter saying he son .... he may looking him . so off he goes journey . but ... murray possibly more complete stone face ? his complete total lack any emotion appalling . i kept waiting this charming , charismatic man who seduced woman after woman pop out . nope . i thought this comedy/drama ? no comedy . no drama . fact everyone this movie acted such stilted restraint this movie it painful . very unrealistic . people not act this way .... conversations time spent each woman he once " relationship " or one night stand ( we never know they never once talk anything much ) boring again unrealistic . if someone i not seen 20 years showed up , i think i might couple questions , some animation . either it anger or surprise . one other thing this movie . it feels claustrophobic . tight . constricted . scenes drag forever . shot him sitting his couch staring 2 min . shots him driving down road ( many those ) horrendous jazz playing ... dragging minute . just constant boring listless shots . it got point if i knew what he going next- say go over his neighbors house- i would fast forward ... knowing it would boring drawn out walk over there . i never ff through movies , this one demanded it . this really horrible movie . i wasted over 2 hours this only end .... total dud . bleck .	-1

i am one many reviewers who purchased this dvd because everyone favorably compared it " seinfeld , " ( not hbo subscriber ) i never seen it . personally , i found this show boring , repetitive , often grating . well , that just me . you might among many people who enjoy this genre comedy . deciding if this dvd you require informed assessment you own taste . buy this dvd if you tend laugh protracted bickering among characters ( " married children " or vicki lawrence show " mama " ) . this not kind gut-splittingly funny politically charged bickering we once enjoyed " all family . " " seinfeld " , you see adults act childish , selfish , irresponsible , uncaring ways . depending how this , it very funny , but " curb " missed mark me . i find self-absorbed new yorkers ( those portrayed seinfeld ) funny , but self-absorbed californians ( " curb " ) just pathetic , not even laughable . you might feel differently . neurosis rudeness backhandedly ridiculed " seinfeld " , but almost celebrated " curb . " characters " seinfeld " roughly half generation younger than those " curb . " seinfeld characters ( who came age " me " era 1980s ) commit variety hilarious middle-age gaffes mis-steps associated lack direction life . older characters " curb , " other hand , offer us only repetitive uncreative barrage antagonistic behavior characteristic people who given up forging new directions life . they merely exist . you might find this funny , but i found it depressing	-1

sum things up , this really george lucus film-with then relatively inexperienced ron howard hired direct-under watchful eye lucus . lucus wrote screenplay , raiding his bookshelf tolkein ( especially " hobbit " ) lewis ( " narnia " ) . then he simply transferred hero/heroine romance his " star wars " screenplay . not necessarily bad thing , it simple way him build feature length screenplay targeting younger viewers but sophisticated enough entertain entire family . " willow " some scary stuff but should not problem average grade school viewer . my rating based comparisons other films similar target audience . i must confess up-front positive bias . my favorite part " star wars " caustic romance han solo princess leia ; " willow " lucus refined his technique actually improved something already close perfection . sorsha ( joanne whalley ) madmartigan ( val kilmer ) substitute nicely carrie fisher harrison ford , added dimension them begin story opposite sides . romantic elements efficiently subtly inserted into film . even though these characters part main storyline , romance separate enough serve film main parallel story . only downside this side story soon becomes more interesting than main one , so much so its climatic kiss ( occurring 20 minutes before ending ) unintentionally turns into film climax ( least energy wise ) . actual resolution main story then plays out rather anti-climatically . " willow " delivery quest story , much like " hobbit " where reluctant nelwyn ( small person ) required set out perilous journey return lost baby ( even smaller ) daikini ( tall person ) . way he assisted couple brownies ( yet smaller guys who speak outrageous french accents ) . size differentials main theme film especially intriguing young viewers who easily identify deal people who tower above them . howard encourages this identification process shooting most action child level . if you watch film young children you amazed its ability draw them into story , this happens because camera angles intentionally match child point-of-view world . viewing child surrogate title character ( warwick davis-who commentary dvd ) , unlikely hero who inspires audience sympathy he bravely faces dangers his journey while gamely putting up ever-changing group irritating companions . there frequent cutaways elora danan ( baby ) , mostly reaction shots . " raising arizona " , producers took enough stock clips match her expressions almost any situation . willow learns early cherlindrea ( dazzling fairy ) elora danan princess who ( it foretold ) one day vanquish evil queen baymorda ( fun role jean marsh ) . things get bit biblical/narnia here queen seeking eliminate princess before she becomes threa t.t he dvd features : " willow : making adventure " ( made during production 1988 ) " willow : morf morphing " ( made 2001 dvd release ) , really put film historical context relative its place evolution special effects . it really transitional point where photochemical ( film ) effects subordinated digital effects . this gave " willow " significant place film history these two featurettes taken together nicely illustrate continuing challenge those involved special effects ; any new development soon overused no longer audience draw . meaning effects people stay cutting edge simply justify their existence . then again , what i know ? i'm only child	1
french pedagogy differs american , so american viewers should not expect american classroom french accent when they watch " " ( " etre et avoir " ) . despite differences style language , however , film powerful because it taps into reservoir universal experience . adults sometimes idealize childhood . maybe they really perfect lives youth , but more likely their memories short . " " recaptures not just innocence sponteneity childhood we idealize , but also uncertainty , need accepted understood , need sometimes difficulty understanding , influence family , importance wise caring teacher or guide . children positively endearing , very individual . some stars ; others struggle . george lopez , instructor , soft-spoken reaches his students ' minds through their hearts well intellect . one things struck me early film how effectvely he reached through his students his quiet wisdom steady hand tiller . quality cinematography editing also excellent support film beautifully . ( i would give this movie 4.5 stars , if option available . ) highly recommended	-1

klaus von bulow ( played jeremy irons ) inject his wife sunny ( glenn close ) insulin cause her fall into coma or not ? originally convicted , this appeal case reversed decision . close narrates film her coma state , ron silver plays hot-shot lawyer alan dershowitz non-stop energy . movie very spirited captivating although it revolves around legal case , it not really courtroom drama since very little it accurs court ; instead we see silver aides scurrying around like chipmunks gathering their appeal case data . course , weight movie lies irons , rather cold , mysterious man who may or may not telling truth . legally he gets off , but we're left impression morally he may guilty . movie compelling we're watching , but , strangely , i found images scenes movie quickly evaporating after it over : it no lasting power . irons won oscar his role	-1

harvey keitel stars fbi agent this dark death-filled tale gangs london . premise simple one , one we've seen many other mob movies . older , established mobsters code honor try things proper way . rash , up coming punks care nothing honor just want quick cash drugs . this case , it american - carl frazer ( played viggo mortensen ) who causing trouble . fbi sent john harris ( keitel ) help london police force shut him down . carl truly psychotic drug / arms dealer who loves gather up lost but innocent young men , tell them they special , then turn them into cold blooded killers . carl gets his thrills corrupting virtuous . there many comments throughout movie - both cops old time mobsters - how these young , sweet kids their lives destroyed drugs lure cash . one scene , old mob guy attacked two these ' kids ' who trying kill him . when he turns tables them , he refuses shoot them - he just tells them leave him alone . i admit i bit issue this constant referring adult men " kids " - they appear their early 20s , they out drinking , working , lives . it always tragic when someone led astray , but call them helpless " boys " or " kids " marginalizing their maturity , my mind . maybe if they'd made boys movie 13-15 age range it would played better me . any case , movie little cardboardy . you crooked cops . keitel hard-fbi-guy-who-is-still-tender . mob guy rough but tender too . viggo over top psycho who smashes prostitute face party because she snorting coke instead doing her job . his main lines action only let him show ' moralless insanity ' without many shades anything else . keitel got lot good moments depth his role , tough bad guys , really caring innocent , wrapped up knots his home life . great role provided craig kelly - he great young man ( oops i mean helpless boy ) who first tries avoid getting sucked into situation , but finally make some hard decisions . violence end , there lot it . there also lot loud clubbing , meaning either your ears blown out noise or you're missing soft dialogue because it muddled . i usually don't any issues all sound balance dvd so i really find it odd how mix here . maybe part intention - make you feel like you didn't know what going immersed this throbbing london scene . great movie watch once - either rental or tv - before you decide if you want actually own it	-1

i never bought vhs tape , but when i notified this would coming out dvd , i ordered it . while i'm not amateur , i am professional , eric guitarist guitarist . anyone who thinks he don't need learnin ' fool only famous his own little world , small it may . i'm not arrogant . danny gatton known humbler , eric johnson could rightly called inspiration . what he not so much difficult it epitome finesse transparency technique . after viewing this , you understand what i mean . i already know much what eric teaches this session , what it , private session ( much like you might get git ) , master top his craft . but there always something learn even after repeated viewings . i even scanned booklet comes this so i break lessons down blow up individual charts more easy reading . if you serious improving player , if you're looking real professional , you need get this , if only see what true professionalism looks sounds like . lessons clear focused . booklet new ability slow down examples , you really learn play these things . but don't expect sound like eric ( just those who tried , but could never sound like jimi hendrix ) . you different so always sound different , that plus . but techniques all included here part " must learn " program you need create follow if you want least make good living playing music . learn master melody technique , where technique doesn't get way melody , but lives service song -- way it should . i teach , too . i recommend any student who wants grow they should get this dvd . if you get no other , this would serve whatever style you choose pursue , ultimately , because there so much here applied virtually any style , whether it jazz , country , blues , rock or even acoustic ( which i wish he would included segment , my only kvetch )	1

me , roger waters ' explanations themes behind album highlight here . he seems think deeply life , but also able express his thoughts simply eloquently . i'd imagine he would made top-class psychologist if he hadn't taken rock roll path . he definitely aura leader , defining piece it direction , while other band members seem content talk musical aspects album , well circumstance its making . this valuable too , its own way , rick wright seems especially good describing his influences music-writing process . there also good input alan parsons chris thomas , well occasional long-haired jounalist giving their commentary album impact . there some on-stage footage , but don't expect too much ; this , after all , documentary making album , it stays well focused task . bonus material exceptional ; highlights include roger waters demo tape " time " radically different finished album track , david gilmour giving some virtuoso solo performances . its hard imagine how it could much better	1

" paradise now " one first post-september 11 films terrorism i've seen it one most overlooked powerful . saying it overlooked isn't completely accurate , it nominated best foreign film academy award it won best foreign film golden globe . most people won't see it though , because it arabic english subtitles . movie two palestinian men named said ( pronunced si-eed ) khaled , who see their life like prison they can't get out . both these men long paradise , whether it real or just their head . so two men join group martyrs , bombs strapped their bodies , begin crossing into israel commit suicide mission tel aviv . it not so one-sided though , movie kind sidetracks ... soon said khaled cross into israel , they separated . khaled gets back martyrs , while said begins wandering around realizes mission his fate he can't change it . movie pretty insightful looking motivations terrorism ( like critic john anderson says cover , although i'm paraphrasing ) ... but , same time , i think most terrorists don't think way said khaled . movie isn't likely offend anyone offended films like " world trade center " or " united 93 " because it terrorism , but not same kind portrayed those films ( i haven't offended any film i've ever seen , so this just opinion ) . even if you're not into reading subtitles , this haunting important film should seen people . this movie potential shown classrooms some point . world where politics make you win oscars grammys ( michael moore , rage against machine , etc . ) ...

i go ahead try break down each disc really memorable moments . every episode certainly something you remember , say great score show , or exta great voice acting batman or guest star , or maybe it one storyline you remember where you seriously thought it thriller , but i try point out some little things this show . course i like 9-10 years old when this show started , but it odd how show gotten better after not watched it around 12 years . disc one- this one my favorite batman episode , movie , whatever , perchance dream how bruce wayne wakes up his parents alive , he married selina kyle , he not even batman , it perfect life . or it ? batman his most thrilling moment this episode . robin reckoning really good serious episode . good conflicts good guys . this easily best disc this volume it also one joker most psycotic episodes-the laughing fish , ninja episodes also get started this disc . disc 2- cat scratch fever one my favorite lines series , batman commenting catwoman fever feeling her head says " you're hot " , catwoman- " now you notice " . hell yeah catwoman hot . heart steel freaking great episode which takes lot bladerunner , which definite good thing . if you're so smart , why aren't you rich episode which i always personally watch one my top 10 batman episodes . it great part where guy so afraid go sleep he goes bed holding shotgun under his blankets . joker " wild one very rare non-great joker shows . i didn't like tyger , tyger all much , one 2-3 episodes i didn't really care , but hey , still better than any cartoon today . disc 3-i said earlier disc 1 best one this maybe but this one tied . moon wolf- tjis great robin college episode scarecrow back up his evil scarings . day samurai- ninja series continues . terror sky- super , great , extrafragalisticexpialidocious episode , serious , yet kid campy funny too . almost got ' em- this episode great example why i love this show . it really takes you back 50 one best humor shows also crams like 5 stories single episode still manages beginning spectacular ending . birds feather-great showcase penguin . what reality- good riddler episode great end level type bad guy . i am night- very emotional episde revolving around commissioner gordon . disc 4- great one all 7 good 6 classics . paging crime doctor ver touhcing episode . harley ivy wonderful episode might chick episode but still us guys too . zatanna always one my favorite characters she knows who batman , i see her coming back future episodes . i left very memorable line top off all these outstanding episodes . man who killed batman , bullock says no make-up , blond hair harley- " don't i know you somewhere " , harley- " i believe i served you sepina once , it small sepina " . absolutely classic . so overall this better than volume 1(no disrespect ) , if continued this fashion , could gone down greatest show ever , but everything come end sometime , right . also i got this mart(nebraska furniture mart ) 26.99 brand new .	1

honestly other reviews it right when they say you should buy yourself hd dvd player buy this movie . it looks amazing , sound out this world film very good , boot	1
tootsie complicated film say least . actor perhaps too much pride his art his own good subsequently alienates any director he ever could've hoped work . he needs finance his friend play , but he can't find work . obvious solution : disguise himself actress get part daytime drama . wrong hands , this could've played out like daytime drama , but smart dialog , careful direction , brilliant performances give film clever grace raise it above trappings its plot . watching dustin hoffman obliviously speak out against his own discretions force us somewhat reevaluate our own views gender . i can't think actor who could've pulled off character , even those who given great drag performances ( i'm not referring wayans brothers , case you wondering ) . bill murray also achieved brilliance roommate who his best take everything stride but thinks maybe " we're going into weird area here . " eighties-ness might little much times ( i little dumbfounded hearing my mother sing one musical interludes next room ) , but this film entertaining it contrived . it doesn't logically work ( i'm little curious how they wrote hoffman character off show after his secret revealed ) , but film this inspired , who cares ?	-1
such incredible energy !! musical genius makes it look so easy . he truly loves play sing rock ' roll it shows . his band also best . insrumentals very complicated but fogerty his group up task . not one dull moment this entire dvd . i highly recommend it .	1
i'll admit i thing sean patrick flannery , but he only one reason i love this movie . this like paperback romance bundled up into lowbudget tv movie . loved it	-1
i just got into asian films , especially japan . daibosatsu ( its title japanese ) amazing piece film , which won adjective " classic " . original thing sword doom , ryunosuke ( principal character ) , kind psycho . he almost never expresses any emotions always talking cold , slow , heartless , monotone , emotionless tone ( only twice he laughs eerie thing listen ) , simple , if-you-said-the-wrong-thing-i'm-going-to-slay-you kind way . guy doesn't even blink . he doesn't care if someone wants kill him . he kills old man just because . story around end tokugawa shogunate , when old order falling apart birth meijin restoration hand . although not necessary , little bit knowledge period help appreciate this movie . b/c , but it helps movie . one things i like best it shows what real swordfight using katanas would look like , not fancy metal clashing against metal hollywood , europe some asian(including japan ) movies . movie strange sense you don't develop any emotion ryunosuke , even when you know he lacks few marbles . simple , he just , you accept tha t.t he story simple , man expel fencing school , challenge match ( pay attention , match , no duel ) , winner become heir school when sensei dies . can't tell you much , ( match turn into duel ... ) simply he so neutral , so amoral , makes him dangerous . his own father wants him dead . he joins shinsengumi , but his lack emotion , together his disregard bushido ( well , not always , but enough piss off hardcore samurai , even those times left interpretation ) , gains him hatred his assassin buddies . ( i highly recommend you read shinsengumi ) . movie great , simply , yet deep . story man obsessed improving his swordmanship , no matter who or what he ends destroying . buy it , i usually tell people rent movies first but i doubt you get this any rental . but don't worry , if you like samurai movies , you like this one . unless you hate enimagtic endings ... which me , it makes story even better .	-1
even though this dated material , corrs , their prime , unique entertaining band . talented fun-loving , they music " hooks you " . almost every song sing-a-long-able , ( new word i created ) . special features , also , help educate their fans or fans-to-be their style inspiration . but , music needs no introduction . it deep , pop , danceable . like abba . there not one song i skip over , after repeated plays . little over-edited , video keeps moving . picture leaves little desired . fans engaged band become part experience . fun watch their reactions	-1
unlike many reviewers here , i'm not biblical expert really don't care if movie adheres stories they portrayed bible . i would just judge movie based its entertainment value ability engage me emotionally . biggest problem this movie it simply seemed too long drawn out . there also some scenes felt like padding added nothing story ( some cases detracted it ) . instance , during long voyage while earth covered water , everyone goes bit crazy . that acceptable premise but it played out theatrically far too long variety embarrassing scenes actors . idea they suffered madness fine introduce but it shouldn't taken up so much time nor quite so adbsurdly plotted out like little play . there also couple ridiculous encounters water ( lot acting pirate merchant who sold them various trinkets water ) which undermined entire story great flood . everyone supposed perished flood it bit absurd few would sailing high seas little boats . it just plain silly , again , seemed put just pad story or add unnecessary " spice " ( it didn't work means jazzing up story ) . i'm guessing writers felt time water long show how noah his family suffered or their faith tested but they also felt it more interesting than just lounging boat taking care animals . this type insecurity telling story most effective way what causes so many productions go bad . movie credit , actors quite good there some good moments but too much movie doesn't work .	-1
i bought this movie my wife . she loved it	1
me , this film matt damon , brilliant newcomer who came out ( seemingly ) nowhere . i floored his performance - one best 20th century . course he supported fine cast - robin williams , ben affleck , loveable minnie driver , whose onscreen chemistry damon sizzling . matt emerald heap cheap diamonds , obviously multi-talented guy - he co-wrote screenplay well starred it . well worth seeing .	1
i don't expect anything more movie than enjoy it entertained . i don't seek psychoanalyze or offer up in-depth critique , it only movie . i either enjoy it or i don't . this one still cracks me up ... marty feldman hilarious , there some corny humor , sure , but it highly enjoyable	-1
it only one competitor so far " air america " .. but air america cannot stand repeat viewing ... i watch this movie every 4 months still bein stitches ...... this definately " mans " comedy ... women not find it funny most men !!! but my opinion it still remains funniest comedy first decade new millenium . ps why doesnt amazon spell checker different fonts/size fonts ??	1
definitely , season 4 columbo winner replete number excellent episodes provide hours enjoyment . " exercise fatality " robert conrad owner string health clubs who murders his partner , " dawn early light , " military school commandant ( patrick mcgoohan ) who murders trustee who wants convert military school co-ed community college , clearly best lot . what fascinating columbo not only quality writing pacing episodes , but remarkable cadre top tier actors appeared show : jack cassidy , robert vaughn , dean stockwell , george hamilton , john cassavettes , oscar werner , lesley ann warren , robert culp , leslie nielsen , janet leigh , gena rowlands name few . if you buy only one season columbo , make it season 4 . unfortunately , only extra dull completely unnecessary episode ms. columbo " caviar everything . " still , no interviews or extras clearly leave columbo fans disappointed hope future boxed sets something more enticing watch -- even episode ridiculous " a-team " would more welcome than ms. columbo . address problems many other amazon reviewers experiencing their dvd sets , i say my set works just fine no malfunctions . i might suggest keeping your dvds their plastic sleeves refraining using them coasters when not use might help . if doesn't work , invest better dvd player .	1
this delightful romantic comedy very engaging main actress ( marguerite moreau ) . after spending years " jerk magnet " , she quit dating scene when lo behold , two decent guys real potential come . like they say , " it never rains but it pours " . she then faced opposite problem deciding which guy would better choice . while watching it , i didn't really know how things would turn out because both guys she into actually quite likeable . fortunately everything ends happily . well it romantic comedy . :) i thought customers might want know specs this dvd seeing amazon continued its bad habit omitting tech specs newer releases . dvd screen media films . it it original aspect ratio 1.85.1 ( enhanced widescreen tv ) . colors accurate . there quite bit film grain but not too distracting . my only quibble presentation black levels closer dull grey so transfer lacks sense depth richness . soundwise it 2.0 5.1 surround pretty decent sound reproduction . there no close captions or subtitles contrary what it says backcover amazon . all all very enjoyable movie . definitely worth viewing	-1

simply stunning flick hd dvd . considering early reviews downplayed difference standard dvd hd , i wasn't expecting such incredible image ( some hd dvds aren't much improvement over regular dvd ; see serenity ) . this disc i'll throw whenever i want show someone what hd dvd all . movie , this what sci-fi should : daring way over top . after pitch black , who would thought riddick story would taken such epic turn ? i don't know whether it ego trip , creative cliff diving , or just return " old school " sci-fi where writers created new myths , unique worlds , bizarre technology ( tread dangerously toward embarrassment coining their own vocabulary -- it get any better than " underverse " " necromongers " ? ) . i hope it latter , but it doesn't matter . just enjoy ride . all tired sci-fi thrown us hollywood , it great something fresh given us . forget what you've read critics fanboys out there ; chronicles riddick real goods . great hd dvd	1

but things really changed much since late forties ? this gem movie neglected classic americana . " letter three wives " uses many same talents who made " all eve " such hit year later , most notably joseph . mankiewicz writer/director celeste holm , who present here voice only addie ross , town flirt . just three town more prominent clubwomen depart day-long trip underprivileged children , they receive note addie -- she run off one their husbands . they whole day think which one it . jeanne crain character insecure because she left her iowa roots married up one town gentry . linda darnell character " shanty irish " married department store millionaire whom they share rather grudging relationship . ann sothern plays radio screenwriter who trying maneuver her way out second-best neighborhood town into very best . sharp observations class social climbing small towns/suburbia , this film sharp writing acting some genuinely funny moments , including star turn kirk douglas droll english teacher ( bet you thought you'd never see him comedy ! ) . look wonderful thelma ritter maid wrong side tracks . all all , " letter three wives " great entertainment welcome addition any video collection . i seen my copy several times introduced it several people .	1

mention name roger moore average moviegoer they'll most likely immediately associate him james bond franchise . makes sense me . after all , moore took up mantle thrown down sean connery eventually made some seven bond films , beginning " live let die " 1973 ending " view kill " 1985 . i'm partial roger moore because this very fact . he definitely my favorite bond ; i enjoy his glib wit , expressions fear when confronted daunting situations , just way he handles himself onscreen . i never turn down opportunity watch one his films when amc or channel runs yet lengthy 007 marathon . it natural , considering how much i enjoy his bond films , i would seek out other roger moore projects . thanks dvd , we're starting see his work " saint " several other efforts reemerge . i'm still waiting " wild geese " , up until short time ago , i eagerly awaited arrival " ffolkes . " finally , i procured copy immediately sat down watch . i wanted see if i liked movie much i ten or fifteen years ago . " ffolkes " story rufus excaliber ffolkes ( moore , course , lower case last name some reason ) , crusty old tar who runs mercenary security service his retirement . you could say this chap sort gentleman businesses turn when they need top-notch security . you could also say governments might turn him well when faced threats not easily deterred conventional forces . , my friends , exactly what happens when terrorist named lou kramer ( anthony hopkins ) hijacks two british oil rigs north sea . technical assistance nerdy looking harold schulman ( michael parks ) gang muscle , kramer rigs platforms high explosives then sends his demands london . predictably , prime minister ( faith brooks ) her cabinet outraged . tendency not negotiate terrorists , however , places government real bind . fortunately , certain insurance concerns -- quite agitated destruction rigs could bankrupt firm -- call rufus excaliber ffolkes save day . it sort task he his people relish , kramer carefully prepared plans demand intellectual well physical response . it tough assignment made all more difficult stormy , cold region . ffolkes rapidly coordinates his plan attack help admiral sir francis brindsen ( james mason ) . outfit manages remove one rigs danger quite quickly easily , but second one bit harder since kramer his thugs float right beside it small boat . kramer emotional state deteriorating fast weather outside . nordic crew ship , led captain olafsen ( jack watson ) , resents their kidnapping kramer constantly irritates terrorist . this cautious defiance , coupled grinding process negotiating british government , soon wears heavily kramer . he oscillates calm explosive rages , always inches away detonator blow rigs sky high . vast majority film takes place boat nearby rig , ffolkes disguises himself british naval officer hope he board ship part negotiating team bring evil kramer down . needless say , plan doesn't go quite smoothly hoped . ffolkes british government save their oil production facilities nick time ? watch see . moore great this movie . he plays no nonsense sort guy set like stone his ways . misanthrope penchant cats , needlepoint , love scotch , loathing women runs core his soul , ffolkes makes interesting character . played roger moore , he hilarious because we immediately realize this guy far james bond one could get . less compelling , least hardcore action film fans , pace content movie . picture one talkiest action movies you're likely see , even when action breaks out it not enough tide over fans big body counts massive explosions . there also several moments incredulity where viewer likely say , " no way . would never happen ! " but that o.k. i like moore so much , i always enjoy watching anthony hopkins go off deep end , i forgave director writer not giving us non-stop action flick . but if you're sort filmgoer who eschews character development tension favor cartwheeling bodies stuff blowing up , you'll likely chafe bit this movie . i'd like give dvd presentation film five stars . i'd like , but i can't couple reasons . one , nary extra graces disc . nothing . nada . zip . not even trailer film . ouch ! i don't know why " ffolkes " received such shabby treatment , but it undeserved my opinion . second , probably more germane actual film , i didn't enjoy movie quite much i when i saw it back when i younger lad . like i mentioned vague way above , i encountered several unbelievable situations scenes during my latest trip through movie . yet " ffolkes " still great , still lot fun , definitely worth seeking out not only bond fans but moore fans well .	-1

stnj , clandestine government organization , employees tasked hunting down capturing witches removing them society . ostensibly , this keep them becoming menaces they recognize begin use their powers . when one their own taken away witch , young italian raised nun , robin , sent replacement . she quickly proves adept hunter , takes initiative hunting , proving herself invaluable team . viewed action title , robin seems episodic , " monster week " feel it . but watching this series carefully , you realize , just storyline , not everything it seems . witch hunter robin excellent gothic mystery , full symbolism , twists , turns , clues . characters develop throughout , not one same when character introduced . robin grows changes through series , she learns many things stnj , her often shady co-workers , her own mysterious pas t.t his title deals witchcraft , subject offensive many . initial portrayal all witches evil should removed society . series deals its own demons demonstrating there many forms evil man visits his brother , addresses paradox fighting evil evil . characters themselves often struggle what good evil when witchcraft involved , giving show vividly realistic feel . those concerned violence or nudity , there violence , but it not gratuitous , it used only advance story demonstrating various witches ' powers . there no nudity . robin seen bath her shoulders up time time . this title definitely worth seeing , again again	1
completely honest , i fooled first episode this series . it so light-hearted innocent i couldn't possibly suspected what come . then , series got , i began understand dark undertones this series , i got feeling i watching something more than simple " alice wonderland " adventure . story follows young boy named shu , brash kid enough energy share ten people , he finds himself strange , desert world ( this starts after first episode ) after battling save blue-haired girl some mysterious , robot-piloting soldiers his home town . this world , away where he grew up went school , shu instant odds leading force here , must not only battle save lala-ru ( blue-haired girl ) but keep himself alive well . ultimately , he ends up prisoner mad king suffers terrible tortures until king satisfied shu knows nothing more than what he admitted . so , shu becomes one child soldiers king army . still , he simmers circumstances his enlistment , eventually makes his escape . outside influence king , shu meets group people who only ones capable putting up fight against mad king , expected , shu decides he should join them . naturally , terrible battle ensues which shu becomes involved . story now then , here there , continues get more more dramatic every episode begins ends , new characters introduced lives lost , it becomes easy get so deeply involved this sentimental violent story you actually feel emotions . it just well , through through . now then , here there compares green legend ran lot ways , but much better my estimation . it also lot similarities some early miyazaki films , such nausicca castle sky . note , though , my recommendations go older audience , not younger audience target miyazaki films . yes , this animation innocent look , but this story definitely isn't younger audience . thirteen may too young , but lot worst happens ( including rape torture ) implied so make it little better . fifteen or higher would better , though . either way , this great box set own , it very cheap ( thirty bucks entire series ) all original material found during now then first dvd release . plus , it powerful anime dramatic , plot-driven story .	1
there something heartbreaking listening people no sense humor explain , resolute logic , why something isn't funny . unless you're unapologetically homophobic , which case you don't deserve fun , there just no reason why you wouldn't delighted this minor masterpiece . forget movie , all you need premise start laughing . australia , widely known most macho place earth , three drag queens go epic journey inland ancient bus named priscilla which routinely breaks down most inconvenient times . while lip-synching abba tunes blaring boom box hardly strikes me art ; combination costumes , wigs , make-up , attitude , dancing required create drag show group aborigines impressive very least , if not heroic . it seems me mrs. doubtfire , tootsie matter , projected level awareness scrubbed so clean it would home love american style . priscilla , contrast , strikes perfect balance . it madly over top hilarious , reveling sheer absurdity outrageousness it all . but it also warm , never patronizing , more characters get know each other more you get know them like them process . there difficult choices end movie , loss . then you really care . all three leads terrific , but terrence stamp standout here . invisible craft he delivers bravest performance his career , it real nuance , not easy pull off when you look like cher . certainly kind film one would qualify " cult classic , " well worth owning . just thing take off shelf when you're starting take yourself too seriously . y-abba-d-abba-do	1

this film true story . it important you know because some facts reactions seem excessive , yet ... it all starts bunch rowdy black kids who run across older white man , local personality who starts playing these boys ten or eleven these boys decide fight against it , probably without knowing what they fighting against , except it not correct let older white man touch you if you little black boy . local police justice officials go road leads same boy who arrested � molesting � older man triple death sentence triple murder he never committed never investigated properly . film absolutely outstanding because it sets emphasis this black man , ex-world champion boxing , transcending this fate getting so high his meditation he truly free prison truly divine his mind . this hurricane thus set example model anyone whose freedom endangered , we move 15 year old black boy brooklyn who buys reads rubin carter book booksale 25 cents . his own life series accidental cicumstances lead him deprevation among alcoholics some achievement � host family � canada . this black boy , lesra , identifies rubin gets involved his case . his canadian guardians get this involvement they eventually bring truth out convince federal court man innocent released prison immediately . what important here how these people react organize their search how it succeeds thanks some nearly immaterial circumstances go their way not simple automatic habitual way . it such cases justify people thinking there hope our societies where poor cannot any justice all because they cannot afford good lawyers very start , later it too late : initial damage rarely redeemed , yet some cases there prove it could , even if it not most time . this one films should studied details all high schools all over world . dr jacques coulardeau , university paris dauphine university paris i pantheon-sorbonne	1

beautiful job dear people warner ! all films included nicely mastered fine prints , but " sweet bird youth " seems little pale shade too dark . no disaster , though ! my only real complaint two more tennessee williams films owned warner left out box . some people upset titles like " boom " " summer smoke " not included . how could they possibly ? they owned other companies . warner home video issue films made mgm warner bros ., but not those owned universal paramount . but ... warner rights " glass menagerie " " period adjustment " ! why these not included this box mystery ! so please , warner , not forget issue them soon possible ! some good universal paramount regarding " boom " " summer smoke " , tennessee willams list films would complete dvd ! well , i suppose we campaign " last mobile hot-shots " too	1

it very disappointing see major actors , cinematographers , editors doing good job decidedly sub-rate material . film looks much , much better than its story . one begins doubts when this family " geniuses " reveal little intellectual heft conversation interaction . paltrow character virtual cipher whose only talent seems finding stashes her cigarettes , despite her promotion " prodigy " . purported love triangle no apparent basis , other words , audience told accept premise without evidence . problem this film written people who not professional , creative writers . characters must shown " interesting " , " conflicted " , " in-love " , " suicidal " , etc . their words actions , not simply because we told they . this only accomplished subtle clever writing , which wholly absent here	-1
i would rate this piece film trash " 0 " , but unfortunately , not available option . this stupid movie not start scene , but it contribute it . this review all you ghetto monkey morons who think because you ground effects obnoxious sounding muffler , somehow you transformed yourselves into mario andretti ferrari ; i some astounding news you , average citizen thinks you idiot license , should barred ever contributing human populus . no one impressed your driving antics endanger rest us roads highways . fact , everytime i read one you idiots died tragic accident due your own ignorance lack driving skills , i actually celebrate my friends , we relieve ourselves grave , because there one less stupid person road . rest world favor , save your money , don't make your car look stupid ghetto , which return , makes you look stupid ghetto , learn how drive safely , turn your hat around ( facing forward ) , pick up your retarded looking baggy pants , put belt , hide your underwear , ( no one wants see , but laughs you while you walk past ) speak normal language includes words besides " dawg " other non-understandable neanderthal sounds clearly indicate your lack education stupidity	-1
what superb cold-war action flick . it all-star cast , all male , many who became stars later . sean connery captain ramius new super sub " red october " . his stature legendary among all soviet submarine captains , but his lithuanian his wife died year earlier while he sea . he no children . officer crew sub hand picked him almost all men who personally loyal him . jack ryan here played alec baldwin one his best roles . he brilliant cia analyst rather than field officer knows submarines . because what develops , he brought cia chief admiral greer ( immortal national treasure james earl jones ) advise national security advisor pelt ( wonderful too soon lost richard jordan ) . there great deal confusion what americans , soviets , various crews various ships know . we , audience , know actual situation , but we concerned who learn what before or after it too late . what i like most this movie while there some heroics , they aren't superman kind stunts show up too many action flicks . people try what they it doesn't always work out without cost or even all well . end , well , you already know or should watch movie find out . i want single out terrific courtney vance sonar genius jones , scott glenn commander mancuso us sub dallas sam neill soviet captain borodin - 2nd ramius . fine performances each . even though ships big , shooting movie such confined quarters risks tedium claustrophobia ( which work film if handled well ) . this film focuses faces shows us people talking small groups so we see emotion their faces they struggle understand what going what should happen next . enjoy	1
even though this film released 1985 , now , more than 20 years later , it still highly entertaining . you get least few moments each character , develop feel them , come like them all . you really want see them succeed , suspense whether they or not constant . this movie good all ages , rated pg . cyndi lauper " goonies ' ' good enough " song nice touch . richard donner steven spielberg created magical movie enjoyed years come	1
i never read any tom clancy works , but i seen all movies made them . patriot games one them . storyline quite simple : jack ryan ( harrison ford ) , former cia analyst , vacation/lecture tour england his family . while way meet them near buckingham palace , he his family caught cross-fire during assassination attempt member royal family , lord holmes ( edward fox ) , rogue faction ira led sean miller ( sean bean ) . ensuing shoot-out , jack killed one terrorists , who happens sean younger brother . jack gets drawn back into cia after terrorists set out vengeful attack against his family back usa . my view , action sequences this movie not very exciting , when compared any recent bond /or bourne movies , although entire movie quite entertaining . i particularly enjoyed sequence showing real-time satellite-tracking session cia hq , during which jack his counter-terrorism team watching crack sas team conducting black ops raid terrorists ' hideout somewhere libya . accompanying music score realistically haunting ! what excites me most this movie watching jack exercising his astute power observation his uncanny ability juxtapose images relentless attempt track down whereabout rogue faction ira ,... high-tech resources cia counter-terrorism group , course . using vital information secured paddy o'neil ( richard harris ) , ira supporter usa , jack narrows down search through his observation/juxtaposition cia satellite images ( which includes overhead snapshot apparently capped woman pony tail ) his own recalled images : - back-view glimpse pony-tailed driver terrorists ' getaway vehicle during foiled assassination attempt england ; - side-view glance pony-tailed driver terrorists ' getaway vehicle during unsuccessful assassination attempt his life outside us naval academy ; all these associations triggered while taking break walking pass pony-tailed woman employee way answer call nature cia headquarters . what brilliant piece detective work - observation plus juxtaposition - part jack ! power observation juxtaposition obviously requisite character traits cia analyst . summing up this review , i enjoyed very much watching patriot games , experientially well educationally . this wonderful addition my resource repertoire	1

" green mile " expertly mixes film genres : it part prison flick , part supernatural mystery part drama . it adapted sephen king novel director/writer frank darabont released 1999 . if you're not admirer stephen king books/films ( i'm not ) don't let deter you viewing this beautiful-and-spiritually-profound film ; " green mile " no means typical horror story , although it couple horrific scenes . story : tom hanks plays head death row guard tennessee prison during depression . new inmate introduced , hulking black man named john coffey ( exquisitely played michael clarke duncan ) , who condemned death rape murder two little girls . hanks his guard friends slowly become intrigued seemingly pure-hearted giant begin realize he eminently gifted decidedly supernatural way ; they conclude there no way he could guilty crime . if that case , who guilty ? guilty party get away it .

i haven't seen 1937 version fred astaire , or 2004 version richard gere , but i don't really feel need see them now . this movie absolutely great . it very similar tampopo . after seeing this movie i checked amazon , they share their main actor ( kji yakusho ) so maybe it not coinceidence . shall we dance tampopo both someone changing their lives trying become proficient certain area ( dancing noodle cooking ) , both cases main characters older man younger woman , both movies tender japanese comedies satirize movie conventions japanese culture . difference tampopo , older man motivating training younger woman , shall we dance it younger woman who motivates train older man . yakusho plays role man stuck japanese work rut , who sees beautiful pensive woman window dance school every evening when he passes train . so he decides enroll able dance woman . way , it changes his life , way he sees other people , changes her life well . i especially liked fact conflict his wife handled realism tact , instead screaming fits " you're sleeping outside tonight " we've trained expect american television . real relief . which movie best , wow ! i can't decide ! tampopo little more substantial , but both wonderful . i'm going agonize over which movie nudge off my top 20 put this one	1
okay , i remember early 90 when nbc beating other networks hits like seinfeld , friends , this bigtime drama . well , this probably really big hit drama during early 90 no one forget . now , i don't recognize today er cast people seem more hollywood than struggling tv actors . so , this first season really defines heart drama tv which giving chance those struggling tv actors really shine . well , i guess george clooney only one break out er big success . others managed get out when scripts ran out steam after 4th or 5th season . well , dvd treatment this season pretty standard . although i would prefered nicer box set individual cases . anyways , dvd package fold-away stack double-sided dvds . yeah , this probably save cost so price would affordable . it annoying super careful but hey , fewer discs end . menus pretty much simple use some discs extras . my favorite looking bloopers final disc . also , interviews cast nice see how actors remember fondly their times er . picture quality episodes first rate seems almost perfect it tv . i don't any complaints transfer since everything looks crisp . so , there no overly dark scenes which difficult see . plus , audio well but i wished there english subtitles . sometimes , doctors , interns , nurses speak too fast action you want catch part their dialogue . this major letdown me since this should standard all us released dvd general ( tv , movies , etc ) . overall , this keeper i would recommend this watch again . you really get heart disciple-pupil relationship carter benton well some funny fiascos deb chen trying please benton . plus , dr. ross nurse hathaway plot full complications which more soapy stuff daytime . but , writers balanced it off operating table i think this season probably best my humble opinion . it makes me think if doctors watched er regular basis , then they would realize humanizing part doctors understanding patient what we really appreciate . well , i just hope my doctor turns out like susan lewis rather than peter benton	1
director david cronenberg creepy well . this may because he seems little creepy himself -- like stodgy , corduroy-wearing history professor who appears totally harmless but secretly likes handcuff women bedposts then place live tarantulas their naked torsos . i doubt director quite extreme , but it kind perversity colors most his movies , especially those made late ' 70s through 1980s . cronenberg second feature film , " rabid , " straddles horror sci-fi ( many his movies ) its story young woman , rose , who , after receiving some experimental skin grafts following horrific motorcycle accident , develops need human blood ( given rose played marilyn chambers , one might even say quot ; insatiablequot ; need blood ) . but it not your usual modern day vampire tale . starters , rose doesn't sprout fangs but rather orifice her armpit resembles inflamed sphincter , through which phallic looking proboscis emerges punctures victim . after which victim generally starts foaming mouth attacking whoever handy . before long , montreal under martial law its citizens become , well , you know ... though not cronenberg best movie , " rabid " holds up his later works like " scanners " " videodrome . " despite low budget , " rabid " some relatively convincing special effects , dreary location shots ( made drearier dank weather ) help establish overall feeling desolation . epidemic martial law aspects his story quite relevant today , if he'd played up plastic surgery angle bit more movie would triply prescient . ( imagine if " rabid " made today , then he could get cameos such surgically reconstructed celebs joan rivers , bruce jenner michael latoya jackson . ) cronenberg script lightly peppered his silly sense humor ( plastic surgeon named dr. keloid ; health minister advice avoiding rabies : " don't get bit " ) , but material played so seriously jokes dry irony rather than overt goofiness . still , all its merits , " rabid " probably wouldn't received nearly much attention it not stunt casting porn star chambers ( al adamson tried similar ploy when he cast georgina spelvin " i spit your corpse " ) . she actually pretty good this movie . commentary track cronenberg wonders why chambers didn't go star more mainstream movies , but this fact doesn't surprise me . even today , when ! entertainment channel regularly profiles porn stars , adult performers usually only cast mainstream movies joke or give low-budget films publicity boost . chambers may proved she could more film than just sex acts , but mainstream hollywood she'd always " just porn star . " extras ventura special edition disc not only include cronenberg commentary but 30-minute interview well . there also theatrical trailer written bios cronenberg chambers . wished chambers provided commentary well ( she even asked ? ) , but her absence hardly detrimental this dvd package . definite must fans david cronenberg , marilyn chambers low-budget creepiness .	-1
yes ! boy meets world great television series rest seasons brink not released absurd . if they don't want mass produce them then they should still let people special order them	1
this film masterpiece - certainly best cartoon i ever seen , one very best films any genre - period . film stars family superheroes - parr - who forced into hiding because series ridiculous lawsuits ( bob parr : " i saved your life ! " , suicide guy : " no , you ruined my death ! " ) . crazy fan " i know all your moves " , who irritates bob point blunt rejection . ejector seat - spoof bond goldfinger movie . evil madman ( " syndrome " - set conditions pointing type disease ! ) owns island called " no-man-is-an " , many other jokes . it also fun contrast hilarious attempts family blend ( daughter violet : " normal - only one this family who normal jack-jack , he not even toilet trained ! " ) dangers they later face . bob longs days hero again , see him contain himself just hilarious , yet sympathetic same time . its interesting see them develop confidence , learn use their powers new ways . finally , i enjoyed seeing them learn work together family - transitioning mundane ( borderline dysfunctional ) formidable team . " jack jack attack " short movie disk 2 fits main film , also hilarious . early bond-style band music also suits film perfectly - even outdoes it . it could appeal some kids who attention span follow story , but i think it more appeal adults who admire creativity craftsmanship . worth multiple viewings . worth every penny	1

" fishing john " makes fun fishing shows while still actually fishing show . it mocks itself much it form . it aimless yet knows full well what it doing . it brilliant it never really tries . these contrasts just few reasons why " fishing john " such great watch . six episodes may not seem like much , but really it just enough , any rate , price certainly right	-1

" king marvin gardens " example why seventies such golden period american filmmaking studios well stars would take chance offbeat material regardless it box office potential . director bob rafelson creates haunting story disparate souls who cling hopes faded atlantic city facade they inhabit . jack nicholson effectively plays against type radio personality who joins up his brother(bruce dern ) partake his latest get-rich-quick scheme all earmarks going up flames . they joined ellen burstyn faded beauty queen who ride futile hope attaining dream . this film not easy watch times but more ambitious viewer appreciate filmmaking dares challenge it audience . gorgeous cinematography atlantic city landscape before casinos erected .	-1

" dirty rotten scoundrels " classic comedy , driven beginning end crafty characters created michael caine steve martin . storyline addressed extensively other reviewers , but i add this film definitely breaks mom old rule : " don't make fun handicapped . " not only martin caine characters both morally handicapped extreme , but martin gets play not one but two handicapped characters he works his cons : one wheelchair , other ( ruprecht ) .... well , i don't know exactly what ruprecht handicap , but i understand why he kept locked up his room . finally , this movie lovely look it , allowing you take fantasy trip french riviera , stay finest hotels villas , sip best champagne - that step up most movies these days right there . no explosions or violence . amazing .	1
ab bootcamp part billy blanks newest ( circa 2005 ) tae bo series , billy bootcamp . i've tae bo fan two years now , own many his early dvds , including original 4-pack , tae bo ii : get ripped ( still my favorite ) , ultimate abs/butt , ultimate upper/lower body . while i love early stuff , tae bo workouts he produced since switching studios ( ventura distribution good times entertainment ) seem more stylish , but considerably less difficult , than his earlier work . i especially disappointed tae bo cardio tae bo capture power series . however , i found myself growing bored what i , so i bit bullet bought tae bo bootcamp series . i'm happy say i don't regret my decision one bit ! unlike other bootcamp workouts , ab bootcamp not require " billy bands " ( pair elastic bands loop around your feet hands , thus adding considerable - almost impossible - resistance your workout ) . thus , you purchase this one dvd its own not worry buying extra equipmen t.t he workout runs 35 minutes length - boy , oh boy , what butt-kicking 35 minutes it ! always , billy starts out some stretching warm-ups . next up calisthenics , including series squats pelvic thrusts i've never seen tae bo before . class also spends good amount time horse stance ( squatting , butts thrust towards floor ) , arms up , torsos twisting side side . this really allows you concentrate your abs work waist . billy introduced this particular exercise many previous workouts , but never this much depth or such long period . you really feel your abs legs working here . finally , it down floor series crunches similar ab exercises . thankfully , billy mixes it up bit allocates some time stretching , which definitely takes edge off more extreme ab work . i've only ab bootcamp five times now , but i already notice difference my abs . i'm adding this one my regular rotation , no doubt . since it also slightly shorter than many other dvds i own ( 15 20 minutes ) , it good those mornings when you're running little late but still want squeeze decent workout . must anyone who wants work their abs ( who doesn't! ? ) . five stars all around ! - kelly garbato , tae bo junki	1
forget days when incubus simulated sounds rage against machine , korn or red hot chili peppers their post-grunge days . incubus moving forward their own brand originality , making " alive red rocks " must see . " fungus amongus " ( 1995 ) brought world funkier version rage against machine . 1997 " s.c.i.e.n.c.e. " huge step forward . although they jumped into whole rap-metal mess limp bizkit korn , record much more endearing , mainly due fact band hip-hop influence came dj opposed brandon boyd ( singer ) . " make yourself " ( 1999 ) showed incubus really settling into their sound , reminiscent red hot chili peppers ' funk-rock style , sounding much more comfortable than their past efforts . it also their most successful mainstream hit date . lessons " make yourself " definitely apply their follow-up 2001 release " morning view " , where they ditch nu-metal/rap-metal sound focus expanding sounds " make yourself " . " crow left murder " marks their most significant welcomed change years . you don't get sense incubus sounds like other bands this record , it simply sounds like incubus ; fresh , original mind-blowing . if you like myself , welcoming change artistically growing band , not whining how they should return rap/metal days " s.c.i.e.n.c.e. " , you just gonna love this dvd ! everyone band pulls their weight flawlessly this concert . every member gets their jaw dropping moments shine show . brandon boyd never sounded better , hitting those highs , lows everything cleaner clearer than ever . ben kenney ( former roots bassist ) shows why he definitely man job , turning out gnarly bass solos , sweet drum solo percussion jaunt featured " vitamin " . jos pasillas shocked hell out me his killer drum solo also featured " vitamin " . he much more talented drummer than i first thought . i don't even know where start guitarist mike einziger . i've seen two other incubus shows dvd , mike baffled me this time . he always fantastic guitarist , but you never realize how good he actually until you hear him belt out solos songs like " priceless " " sick , sad little world " . i awe speed , timing precision he displayed . since incubus " jam band " side them , those solos get stretched out like mad , making it even more enjoyable than album versions . one main reasons i bought this dvd see how well mike would able pull off solo " sick , sad little world " ; you not disappointed . this definitely incubus ' quintessential live performance . no die hard incubus fan would missing this dvd their discography	1

this film its place " ground breaking " idea . it comedy placed , subtle genuinely funny . some films , such star trek , trying come up warped ideas 100% time . good food-for-thought , but it get tedious towards end series . i truly enjoyed watching groundhog day 2nd time , which probably enough any film - otherwise it starts become groundhog day our own . after first time i came away feeling whole purpose our hero win bedroom conquest . second thoughts it not so gratuitous ( mainly because it isn't overdone ) . but it still seems strange it aim whole plotline . why can't they simply fall love then groundhog day over	1

i own vhs tapes this series enjoyed it very much . it beautiful visual effects shows much personal lives astronomers . it would even better if carl sagan , most lively interesting astronomer our time , involved making this series . unfortunately , he not even appear any episodes . decade passed since cosmos series , sagan , perhaps because health reasons , apparently unable contribute his talents this project . but it very compelling series since you see work astronomers very personal perspective . graphics animation attractive appealing use best technology available time	-1

i liked but didn't love first two mi films . first artsy but somewhat convoluted not well-paced . second exciting extreme , but bloated , pretentious ( e.g. signature john woo doves ) lacking any sort subtlety , we've seen other woo films ( e.g. face/off ) . mi :3 feels completely different than its predecessors , thanks writing directing jj abrahms , creator " alias " " lost . " you see his style all over this film . best way describe mi :3 this : first half like really , really good episode " alias , " but $50 million budget . second half like really , really good episode " 24 " , but $50 million budget . if you like both these exciting tv shows , i am pretty sure you like mi :3 lot . i know tom cruise lost lot folks ' goodwill , couch-jumping hysterics , his totally out-of-line comments brooke shields ' post partum depression , other high profile screw-ups . it would totally understandable if you didn't want bother his films anymore . but i respectfully ask you cut him little slack , just 120 minutes , just long enough enjoy this film . it worth it , trust me !	-1
i first saw this movie high school theater . i extremely moved film , it triggered facination south asia lasts this day - i even work half year sri lanka now . so me , personally , this movie tremendous influence . i understand arguements crediting non-white actors ; i always wondered why candice bergman given top billing , given she only appears very few scenes . well , that way world - it marketing right or wrong , get people into theater you highlight those who well known . it not right , but that hollywood . i mean , better unfair credits than not movie all , yes ? you've got admit , it quite debut ben kingsly . wow . he'll forever known this role . aside , this excellent , amazing film . course , it still highly relevant , perhaps even more so our post-911 world fear . movie ends feeling real hope inspiration . must-see anyone who feels anger , fear , agressively nationalistic , hopelessness , hatred , or lost . i think several politicans who need see this movie	1
if you're going parody countless number straight teen comedies , least make your movie funnier smarter than they . this movie neither doesn't credit its audience any intellect whatsoever . i nothing against lowbrow comedy , but jokes gags here just plain tired . over-douching yourself point constant crapping funny anyone over age 12 ? jokes gerbils nambla - c'mon . i know i'll get hell taking my gay self too seriously , but gerbil jokes nambla equated gay offensive . maybe if their respective jokes funny i'd feel differently , but they anything but . just stupid . if there redeeming factor this movie , it attractive actors , but that really it .	-1
absolutely great ! i love this movie when i saw it here i get it . delivered quickely . no damages . overall 5 stars	1
well , my kids really enjoy this movie . they actually sit through whole movie they only 2 3 1/2 . i don't want make too many comments adults because i'm sure most adults aren't going buy this just themselves . i wouldn't recommend but if you looking movie please your kids then i'd highly recommend this movie . i think all kids up age 8 or so would enjoy this movie . basically story this little boy all sudden finds he hear everything dogs say . supposedly there planet out there made up all dogs hubble boy dog just sent there grade dogs earth . so , like i said this movie i'd recommend kids but adults might think it little far-fetched .	-1
first , let me start off saying i think casting choices this movie perfect . i doubts movie would any good , because i'm not exactly fan jennifer lopez acting , but she brilliant job playing her par t.t he movie great sensual dance seens , substantial , interesting storyline go it . i'm addicted dance movies , anyone who says dance movie older people it can't good definitely wrong . richard gere amazing . this movie rocked	-1
its own terms , this movie winner . why it totally true history or not , actors today cannot this believable . performances universally convincing . made 1985 , why it everyone this movie put their heart into their performance , thus i mesmerized delighted . when you shed tear these young people caught up tragedy political manipulation , it no more than tears these young actors , so convincing so deeply rendered . how i wish i could own twenty films like this one !	1
what it don mckellar why you keep seeing him movies ? he represent some sort canadian triple threat like orson welles usa ? all through two hours childstar i kept wondering casting agents who said , " perfect fit our don mckellar ! " those you who don't know who i'm talking , he every canadian movie manages cross border us -- so called " nylon curtain . " he little bit like woody allen , his constant stream backtalk non sequiturs nerdy intellectual appeal . except don more fit , almost like real star , good figure hint hard muscle . opposite him , jennifer jason leigh more appealing than i've ever seen her movie , she beautiful too , almost though she some sort plastic surgery soul , how old she now , she still young , but she gorgeous here driven " stage mother " determined prove old cliche wrong . her little boy , taylor brandon burns , huge us sitcom star who acts up fictional show called family differences son omnipresent but goodhumored alan thicke . toronto lures him promise big screen glory " first son " ludicrous action movie aimed tweens which he gets save entire western world drive fighter plane rescue dad , potus , cabal evildoers who him tied up riding chair air force one . if " first son " more entertaining than tired satire childstar , who says you choose ? you get both movies you get more them than you want , anyhow . i like , wtf don mckellar , but now i know he good me . sign me up whatever club he stands	-1
i thought movie great ! van damme not getting any younger he getting older well maybe he can't kick like he use . but he very sincere actor . i seen greater performances his earlier movies . i give him credit , he still kicking butt he darn good angle when he kicks . any true fan would not put actor down . give me break he only human . jean-claude van damme you great actor my book . although i would like see you play more love scene movie . kiss you vivica . fox great !!!! stay strong baby	1
i travel work , so i often rely fitness dvds help me stay shape . i've only working out seriously few months , this dvd definitely too easy me . there 2 cardio workouts , 5 toning work outs , warm up , cool down , all over toning workout . this seems great , but when you actually look details , you'll see cardio workouts only 13 minutes each , toning workouts only 5 minutes each . so when you actually look pre-set workouts ( without warm up cool down ) , you're only getting 20 minutes real exercise . i would say this good dvd if you've never exercised or you really out shape . but even if you've exercising little while , you'll probably find it too easy . i strongly recommend method cardio bootcamp , or 10 minute solutions carb burner , or 10 minute solutions pilates . all three these videos give you ability choose your workouts or combine smaller segments into longer workout . if you're looking good toning workout , try self bikini ready fast .	-1
i actually bought this dvd because virginia madsen just seen " sideways " . i won't re-hash plot amazon already provided potential buyers outline . however , while madsen all members cast great don johnson real revelation here . his acting nothing short superb complex part required him demonstrate wide emotional range slick cynicism tenderness , homicidal rage/grief abject confusion smart operator who thoroughly out played . looks plus smarts plus intention equal sex appeal . no wonder women fought over him .	1

" logan run " great nostalgic 1970s science fiction . 70s great era sci-fi , where future viewed optimism , awe wonder , unlike digital-age , cookie-cutter sci-fi we get today , offers nothing but gloom doom . i just little kid when " logan run " first released , but i remember blown away it premise -- futuristic society young people living inside futuristic domed-city , where you're not allowed live past age 30 . there really no where runners ( those who refuse end their lives 30 voluntarily ) go elude sandmen ( city police ) , outside domed-city post-apocalyptic , laid ruins earth outside-somewhere near old city washington . .. michael york plays logan 5 , one sandmen who turns out more heart than city would probably prefer . richard jordan ( francis 7 ) his fellow sandman/friend who fiercely loyal city status quo , begins doubts logan loyalty this status quo after he finds logan hanging around nursery . reason all this you'll find out when you watch movie . i actually wish they shown more domed-city than they . it really cool-looking structure , fascinating sci-fi concept . but you see exterior aerial visual-effects shots city movie opening , then few glimpses afterward , but after opening shots , movie quickly gets story surrounding characters , lot scenes take place sets scenes location . like redressed shopping malls , because indoor malls new 70 , people still fascinated these indoor shopping arenas , so it made sense redress one these new malls represent interior futuristic city . but miniatures built exterior aerial shots domed-city really cool look . some people , probably younger people who grew up this cgi age , ridicule film city looking fake like model . yeah , if you squint , you makes out few imperfections , but so what ? minatures look spectacular their time . but all dated aspects this film what makes it all more interesting . imperfection more interesting than perfection anyway . but " logan run " one last sci-fi epics . those stand-alone films like grand mgm stamp them . everything today so cookie-cutter bland , production companies you've never heard putting out direc t-t o-dvd caliber movies faster than bic corporation putting out pens . it just not same anymore . but definately purchase " logan run " dvd . it even better viewing it widescreen , it shown theaters	-1

i not seen this movie years , recently added it my netflix list . i forgot how much i enjoyed this movie first time i viewed it . based best-selling book , eagle landed very entertaining . cast strong action pretty non-stop . michael caine , robert duval , larry hagman all provide excellent performances . negative side , movie little long today standards , donald sutherland character somewhat over . but , it fun follow twists plot progresses , realize end no one really wins . fictional german plot kill churchill prevented , some crack german paratroopers all die . if you like movies such where eagles dare guns navarone , you probably enjoy eagle landed well	1
" lie me " sexually charged love story somehow got away mpaa rating . i think filmmakers must mpaa , because this movie got some graphic scenes . we're talking full frontal male female nudity , sex looks very unsimulated . you don't see full penetration , but ... well , you'll see it . this movie adapted book i hope book more depth than this , because i feel something must lost transition book-to-screen . movie leila ( lauren lee smith ) , girl lot people would call " slut . " leila likes sex she likes it lot . she doesn't seem understand love or relationship , but she understands sex . could this attributed bad homelife ? it could , but filmmakers don't really show her bad homelife . her parents getting divorced her sister get married , despite sex her ex just couple nights before marriage . it kind bad , but not this bad . anyway , leila ends up party where she hastily drags guy outside begins performing oral sex him . meanwhile , guy she met few minutes ago named david ( eric balfour , ' texas chainsaw massacre ' ) sitting truck watching her his girlfriend . girlfriend begins copying leila both leila david sex their respective partners ; they look each other something there . they may not sure what , but it there . next day , david goes looking leila he finds her . she begins masturbate playground him , which freaks him out bit , but he returns her they both sex i swear isn't simulated . there almost no way it could . anyway , some reason ; we find out david caring his invalid father . but this really important plot ? i mean it bit heartwrenching , but not very important . this movie could've poignant , but that where it misses . performances good enough movie entertaining ; it vast improvement over sexually charged movie called " 9 songs " ( which sex wasn't simulated slightly more graphic than this ) . balfour smith make cute couple ; sex scenes great . but , overall , it misses bit . grade : b-	-1

i cannot believe how many negative reviews this film actually received . they watching same movie i watching ? i generally concider myself very critical when it comes political thrillers such " sentinel " , so i am not going just generally give such movie one my favorite genres high rating automatically without giving it some fore-thought . " sentinel " everything intense , well-crafted political thriller should . acting quite convincing suspense riveting . i guarantee you pinned edge your seat through entire film then some . also , scenario extremely plausible , especially today world , all militant groups out there -- neo-nazis islamic radicals -- who would stop nothing make assination attempt or terrorist attack against president or some u.s. institution . my advice , before listening negative rants other reviewers this film , go ahead take look it yourself . it safe bet you not disappointed .	1
this overwrought tripe cinematic equivalent dead fish . it doesn't work good trash or high camp . edward dmytryk directs harold robbins ' source material lead foot . george peppard made larger artistic contribution when he " a-team " . alan ladd , who misfortune this his last film credit , essentially sleepwalks through this picture . it equally unfortunate talented actors like carroll baker , elizabeth ashley , martin balsam associated this swill . heck , i even feel bad former boxing champ archie moore his play thankless role houseboy . film lone redeeming quality costume designs edith head(the women lingeree particular ) . if you must waste 150 minutes your time it better spent watching paint dry or grass grow	-1

i've seen this movie time time since 1970 , but , image entertainment dvd , i feel like i'm seeing it first time -- it good ! picture my public domain dvd ( which i just threw out ) basically looked like few light areas ( faces , lamps , etc . ) surrounded large black areas no details - actually , i should say large dark gray areas no details . it often hard see where characters what they doing . picture image dvd much-closer-to-normal gray scale shows much finer detail . you see things shadows . gray scale still isn't quite up modern standards , but i'm sure that not image fault . you're watching 85-year-old movie . they used best print they could find , it vast improvement over anything else i've seen . there string quartet score which works very well movie . if you didn't know better , you'd think it original score . they recreated expressionist style original intertitles , even added some " digi-dirt " make them better match rest film . translation doesn't use obscure words like " mountebank " " fakir , " like my public domain copy . ( yes , course you look them up , but who wants run dictionary while they're watching movie ? )plus , it tinted match original . helps this movie lot , because its odd sets , it often hard tell if scene set indoors or out , or if it day or night . picky i am , i didn't find frame line too distracting ! it not many scenes . i'm glad they allowed us see whole picture , rather than cropping shots . i haven't seen kino version , so i can't compare two , but i recommend this version without reservations	1

i'm starting think number one requirement job " president " should " acting experience .

it ability see dead people ? yes , sense . but broader sense , it ability see invisible , non-sensory forces motivate people behaviors . movie , sense manifested child ability see " ghosts , " ability see undead people whose souls not rest , still troubled what they perceive mistakes their past . many children adults gifted ability " see " what other people cannot see , ability see what read lines 5 normal senses . 6th sense sensory skill improved through effort education . it often learned best watching socially intelligent women who suffered greatly decided try find ways understand care those hurting around them . 6th sense empathy . if tree falls woods , no one around , it still heard empathetic people . those us who understand grief losing someone , pains not diminish after they pass away prematurely . time passing not ease pain . intoxicants not kill pain . we never stop remembering their light , their humor , their hopes , our loss connection . like ghosts , best sense term , we see them regularly revisit us . this great film these , many more universal reasons	1

someone well versed various kinds literature , someone who read ( enjoyed ) almost all tom clancy novels , professional videographer , i say , this great flick . those who upset adaptation , what you expect ? when taking 800 plus page book condensing it down two hour movie , some things going change . second third clancy movies- especially clear present danger - also adapted give harrison ford action spotlight . but now ford ageing , paramount ( who after all , business needing turn profit ) needed re-invent franchise . move make it not just new actor , but show it start jack ryan career cleverly . most all , it held true idea book , when we base our actions off our fears suspicions , our peace torn apart few depraved individuals . this movie falls into category action/thriller . such , not everything true life , but instead designed entertainment suspense . it delivers . something action category it remarkably intelligent script . it little slow beginning those who looking nothing more than explosions shootouts , but it worth it . it also better than average cinematography compared most action flicks . effects well not all cheesy , many action flicks taught us expec t.t he acting well-done , typically good performance affleck stellar performance freeman . soundtrack also fantastic , especially rendition national anthem football game . bottom line , if you're reader who expects movies scripts written like books , don't see this movie . if you accept literature movies entirely different formats entertainment then you'll probably enjoy this movie , it certainly worth ownin	1
i'm avid reader , always , but i've felt kind burned out reading late , who wouldn't after reading hundreds hundreds books , one after , usually reading two books time , several books week ? also , my schedule no longer allows me freedom read much i used . why i decided watch this film when netflix sent it me despite fact i hadn't read nicholas sparks novel first . now i wish i'd read book . this one most beautiful tear-jerking stories i seen ! everyone who knows me knows i'm sucker stories pull heart strings . they also know stories centered star-crossed lovers my major weakness . most my all-time favorite books movies those characteristics common . i won't go into details plot because i don't want give away spoilers potential viewers ( though i'm sure many people already ) -- all i say you cannot go wrong this film if you're hopeless romantic . actors wonderful . ryan gosling rachel mcadams transmit all right emotions flawless job characterization . they add great deal depth range their characters i can't imagine better actors roles . gena rowlands also wonderful older allie . i like 1940s setting backdrop -- however brief -- second world war . wardrobe , settings , scenery cinematography flawless . dvd great investment . widescreen edition makes viewing all more pleasurable . i cannot recommend notebook enough . i don't know if i'll read book because i don't like reading novels after i watched their film adaptations , but i definitely read other nicholas sparks novels not-so-distant future	1

brilliant companion piece swimming pool , francois ozon under sand similarly casts charlotte rampling lead female , here tale loss . interestingly , both films , she position someone not only literate but directly involved literature . swimming pool , she writer ; here , she instructor literature . this key understanding how subtle ozon these two masterful films . parallel both works fusing fantasy reality . under sand , marie ( rampling ) husband disappears her fantasy life -- reinforced , it implied , her profession -- blossoms into imagining her husband still her , long after his disappearance , , well , feeling hands stroking all parts her body one amazing scene . more subtly , ozon here , swimming pool , uses mix french english -- both language culture -- emphasize blurring fantasy reality . when marie best friend -- like her , bilingual english woman married french man -- speaks her , it sometimes french , sometimes english , indicating fluidity thought feeling two modes existence . marie friend sympathizes her loss -- french -- but wants her face up reality what happened continue her life -- english . similarly , marie new lover tells her he thinks english morbid . but he french tells her this french ; it shows , ozon says , there desire french feel deeply , contrasted english who desire think deeply . such implication here . marie french , though born english , it just this fusing two cultures within herself results her confusion fantasy reality . however , it would too easy equate french fantasy english reality ; ozon not really this simplistically above seems indicate . instead , he imply this several scenes , but well shows us marie telling her friend , english , jean ( her lost husband ) taking nap or out walk when he not her year or so . , marie herself not able distinguish difference two cultures flowing her blood -- not able differentiate simply all difference fantasy reality , thought feeling . this brought head great ending sequence , not revealed here , which jean , perhaps , not lost after all . or he ? ozon superbly intelligent filmmaker who closely investigates what how we think feel , delicately exposing nuances behavior how they determine who we really . subtlety shown his work truly astonishing marks him one great french directors working today	1

this canadian film ( set british columbia ) tells story young working class woman who learns she fast-growing , untreatable cancer dead within months . oddly enough , she decides not tell anyone ( how she stand it ? ) instead makes list things she wants before she dies . much film involves affair she ( character played mark ruffalo ) -- she her first child 17 , her husband her first only , so she wants broaden her experience life before she dies . i think way she handles this news her impending death odd probably unfair people she loves ( she doesn't see it way ) , i think someone who real life would leave lot angry people behind , who never chance say things they wanted say . but this film , after all , it credible someone would this . she , after all , very young very young don't always make great choices . if you watch this film others , i think you'll find lots talk . don't watch it if you're already feeling depressed , because it sad movie many ways .	-1

when i walzted into blockbuster other day(but like any other day ) i head straight anime section . avid fan anime , i plunge headlong into any anime and/or manga , knowing relativley nothing it . so , my sister i stood pondering over which dvd grab(we there well over ten minutes ) we snatched whatever looked least hlfway decent , it just happened appleseed escaflowne . we portable dvd player car , , because i knew alittle bit appleseed , we watched first . holy crap(excuse my bluntness ) but i amazed thoroughly enjoyed mysef . really great movie , but that beside point . so when we finally return home , i good mood hadhigh hopes escaflowne would good too , although i never heard it . we popped dvd began watch . well , my sister very imature kept commenting hitomi nose . ahh ... she so annoying , but i didn't care particularly how character looked . it seemed intresting beginning , how hitomi persieved life , it made sense how she felt . then wierd stuff began . i guess because i haven't watched tv series , i didin't really understand gaia all . wasn't much history movie , so i didn't understand hw everything tied . anyway , i liked van his relationship his brother i like van . . . alot . but i found hitomi rather annoying , constatly damsel distress beckoning aid others complaining her mundane lifestyle ... well , i could go one one . dragon armor , escaflowne cool , i liked raw savagnss fight armours end . but there just something kept me really likeing it . there good premise movie , but it almost poorly executed . writing hitomi absolutly horendous . trust me , there numerous accounts which she repeated same thing over over , which i would understand if she contradicting herself , but it more reasuring herself out loud everything . consistantly annoying . it almost good , so i give it 4 out 5 . but my sister would give it much , much less	-1

disney really gave this film ar t-t reasure treatment . film nearly 50 years old , but colors glow sound wonderful . painstaking frame-by-frame restoration conducted , soundtrack remastered , resulting film which probably looks better now dvd than when it originally released . this film always favorite mine all disney classics , i think music lot it . " once upon dream " truly beautiful , which given considering classical composition it based . artwork superb , even disney its heyday . this movie rightly considered classic , finally given its due dvd	1
this dvd great it lots exercises tailored todifferent body areas . i found it cumbersome work through because each set exercises different segment choose dvd , so you must stop periodically click anew segment . however , fairness i say they providean option creating your own program , which probablythe best way it . denise her usual excellent job giving precise , simple-to-follow directions , provides lots varietyhere too . beginner could probably negotiate through this buti would rate it better advanced beginner orintermediate .	-1
i'm glad dvds finally coming out this series . i'm biased -- i writer executive producer show several years i've written seven original diagnosis murder novels . my only complaint this dvd boxed set -- beyond lack commentaries , deleted scenes , other material -- they didn't include tv movies produced aired broadcast pilot ( jake fatman episode ) premiere first season episodes . hopefully they include those movies bonus materials subsequent dvd sets	1
real women curves story ana ( played america ferrera ) , latina teenager , during summer her 18th year . ana beautiful . hourglass figure melon breasts , full lips long thick hair . she intelligent strong willed but held back her family , especially her mother who constantly berates her because her physical appearance . ana lives her family east los angeles mexican community but she goes high school beverly hills ; feat she accomplished her own . story begins ana getting ready her last day high school . her mother feigns sick get her stay home but ana doesn't fall it heads off school showing immediately strained relationship these two women emphasis ana places education . ana mother , carmen ( played lupe ontiveros ) old school ; she started working her family when she thirteen . she married young became mother . work family her life . she wants same ana wants ana want same which odd scenario because most story mom want more their children . carmen constantly insults ana her weight front everyone . story moves it becomes more disturbing . estela ( played ingrid oliu ) ana adult sister . she still lives home runs sewing factory where they all work , estela fashion design . they make dresses bloomingdales , getting $18 dress when store sells them $600 . this infuriates ana well fact they never make dresses bigger than size 7 . estela many heavy weights beside physical weight she carries . she fighting keep factory open , pay rent , get dresses made time satisfy buyers keep her employees working despite inability pay them their wages . three employees move back mexico estela ana promise stay help recent order . ana unknowing help , estela steps outside box begins designing her own dresses . special gift , she makes special red gown ana , regrettably we never get see ana it . like ana but lesser degree , carmen berates estella . it during one these time carmen mentions love , " it because i love you i make your life so miserable . " estela replies , love me less . george lopez makes appearance ana teacher , mr. guzman . he encourages her go college , helps her fill out her college application makes special visit plead ana parents let her go college when she offered full scholarship columbia . although small role , lopez character effective nurturing teacher looking help woman his own community . best scene movie when women factory , strip their underwear expose their secrets . it all starts when ana can't take heat factory any longer removes her shirt cool herself . her mother freaks , telling her she too fat show much her body . ana not ashamed or afraid her body she lets her mother know it . other women factory back her up . they begin share their body parts how they feel it . they take off their clothes which further infuriates carmen . " this who we " yells ana , " real women . " they all celebrate each other ( without carmen ) go back work their underwear after carmen walks out . this seen easily shows how ana estela evolve while carmen seems trapped her bitterness insecurities . she opportunity bond her daughters , women , chooses not . it very exhilarating watch . real women curves worth seeing this scene alone . throughout movie laced lots peppy mexican music shots mexican community . there subtitles family members but it isn't distracting enough cumbersome adds angst family . i love this little film strong willed girl transition teenager into woman . america ferrera plays part ana confident teenager who devilish side egging her mother . she still insecurities discover conquer . it easy love her , her sister even her mother . i would liked estela storyline expanded hers interesting character . most importantly this film success success characters not contingent ana losing weight finding true love happy . real women curves movie not only latina women but , i think , girls women everywhere battling views others how they should feel their bodies . original review posted http://largeandlovely.bellaonline.co	-1
better title this cheap-budget film " staying lame , " since it nothing more than shell plot featuring two well-known actors . when i say actors , i may stretching it bit , since samuel . gives wooden performance every time , while ben " good hunting " affleck performed best lo arm candy . but movie pitiful back-and-forth revenge saga , unbelievable , reminiscent ping-pong match . it " firm " wannabe , bruce willis entendre copy not worth $4 it cost rent your local video rental store . hopefully , one day , both main actors go acting school , or better yet , stop making movies altogether . but then , there always remake " gone fishin '" starring danny glover joe pesci would perfect sammy benny . , or both could act together inside jaba hutt costume final prequel star wars . just don't expect me rent it when it comes out .	-1

" memento " eclipses everything which preceded it , set bar so high it may never topped . all $5 million production costs . director nolan remarkable job juggling complex plot elements , but sabotages himself some his rather ordinary visual schemes . i refer you diner sequence which characters portrayed guy pearce joe pantoliano converse over soup . given film shot panavision 2.35 : 1 anamorphic process , scene would played more effectively if nolan simply planted his camera medium shot two skillful actors they provided plot exposition . instead , nolan intercuts close ups two , which method more typical appropriate narrower aspect ratio television . close ups work best when used judiciously provide emphasis . i mention this only because this how detailed i go order find fault film . if i didn't know better i would swear pearce american actor -- his accent authentic . all performances convincing it always fun see " eve 6 " ( harriet sansom harris ) great " x-files " episode . this film proof morally bankrupt notion movies cost $200 miilion or more . i am sick ugly , witless , loud blockbusters which polluting pop culture . if choice spend sort money making movie ... or allow movie go unmade ...

i purchased this season trepidation i dubious changes casting i loved previous 8 seasons richard dean anderson rest . humour excellent each episode most enjoyable leaving me always wanting more . well , imagine my surprise when i watched first few episodes find changes not detracted show all but made it every bit good before . writers etc not tried replace o'niell character but introduced new dynamic some excellent humour . episodes very good while i still 4 episodes watch , i am hoping rumours show cancelled after season 10 not true . i watch this show long it available . ( i watch dvd i not get show tv here ) . i love new humour all cast transition gou'ald ori interestingly handled . it also great see team not always succeed , but i hope they eventually overcome ori . extras , i enjoyed those i watched , but i generally not buy dvds extras rather show/movie . extras bonus . i would heartily recommend this season any stargate fans out there who dubious due cast change . those who yet watch eny episode , rather watch first 8 seasons first , then this one there references past incidents flash backs not likely make sense if you haven't seen them . roll next season !!!!	1
there really so much say this movie , condensing it all into short review impossible . put it simply possible , brokeback mountain work art slowly almost subliminally works its way into your psyche , refusing hint or portray its message until very end , which point your emotions virtually devastate you . storyline pretty well-known now . jack ennis , two 19-year-old ranch hands , hired early 1960 tend flock sheep atop grazing grounds brokeback mountain montana . jack , son overly strict distant father , quick make friends laugh , while ennis , orphan raised his brother sister , shy , withdrawn , almost gun-shy society . during course summer , jack gradually draws ennis out his shell two unexpectedly start sexual relationship . end summer , each goes their own way start traditional families , but cannot deny feelings they each other . they then maintain 20-year romance through camping fishing trips several times year . execution this movie near flawless ! cinematography so beautiful points , it almost too much eyes comprehend . musical score understated feels perfectly home within film . direction near perfect . film never loses focus two actors ... opening scene end , this movie them . supporting characters never dismissed , though attention not focused them , they nonetheless memorable without ever stealing scenes actors . only drawback film makeup . 2nd part film takes place over span 20 years , shows actors gradually aging 19 39 . makeup isn't quite up job make these young actors appear middle-aged weathered . all honesty though , i'm not sure any makeup anywhere fully pull off . actors , jake gyllenhall heath ledger played their roles beautifully . it quickly becomes apparent actors chose these parts not money , nor any fame ( it never meant released major film ) , but rather because they believed story wanted portray their characters best they could . jake gives life jack refreshingly wonderful manner , heath disappears , leaving behind withdrawn , shell-shocked ennis . movie progresses very slow pace . it never boring , but throughout one wonders where film going what it trying say . sentiment continues grow almost threatens lose you audience member until last 20 minutes or so . point , plot takes sudden surprisingly-devastating turn . it surprisingly devastating because you simply don't expect made such emotional connection characters , but found you . film reaches it emotional impact , it becomes achingly apparent it woven itself under your skin now part you ... it its claws you not letting go . it climaxes , you're left rush emotion surprises you few films ever able garner . it point where you realize purpose everything previously film . entire film leadup one simple message , one simple premise . it gut-wrenching realization end lingers your mind long after you've walked away screen . movie honest . it documents portrays . it makes no statement or against homosexuality . it unapologetic , yet compassionate . it all-time classic	1

spun absolute pleasure watch . it doesn't wait around get noticed , instead it sets it own pace , like example - no credits roll beginning , no apologetic character introductions , there no stop sign this film , everything unhooked raw , yet nothing seems out place . direction bizzare , camerawork staggering places , sets like gutters , music extraordinarily amusing acting level . there many characters film quite wide variety too . reason i compare spun run lola run because it nearly entertaining german wonderflick . spun possibly one kind . i enjoyed it more than i enjoyed trainspotting . now , saying lot . unfortunately , i haven't seen many movies like spun hollywood . so i no recommendations . this absolute must watch , if there ever one	1

what you say columbo , unassuming bungling , yet brilliant sleuth who always gets his man or woman . part brilliance this series murder occurs beginning episode . columbo then called scene crime his annoying ultimately endearing manner slowly unravels mystery . it becomes obvious early columbo uncanny instincts , intelligence experience handle job almost always suspect mind . murders ingenious sometimes umpremeditated , yet murderers all ultimately incrimminate themselves their own behavior many clues they drop way . when columbo finally nabs his mouse after long determined pursuit , he then reveals them their one fatal mistake which led their undoing . while there no class distinction crime , it certainly more interesting watching accomplished often brilliant individuals extraordinary settings than common street thugs drug dealers . you learn wealthy their problems just like everyone else often victimized themselves . impressive settings , creative plots excellent performances , all directed renowned film makers sure stimulate your mind senses columbo destined remain delight small screen . season four just engaging first three seasons i personally difficult time deciding which i like best . columbo series hits its stride early remains consistently good several seasons come . you can't miss here quality never falters columbo never fails deliver . only exception me episode mrs. columbo which i never liked . other than , you're safe selecting this great addition your collection or first many seasons you inevitably want .	1

this past august , i bought soundtrack pete townsend 1989 musical iron man , which also based ted hughes 1968 novel , impressed not only mr. townsend artistry , but also wisdom message its songs conveyed individual selections entire album just plain fun listen . naturally , i thus came thinking maybe this motion picture , which released whole decade after particular cd , would likely appeal my imagination same way musical would , i only opportunity see latter presentation myself . unfortunately , i found out how wrong i when i rented this rightfully less-than-appreciated flick last weekend forced myself sit through it . now , i'll admit , animation definitely something worthy applause ; that one thing i'll give iron giant credit . however , that far my praise this movie goes . i'll also admit it didn't follow exact same lines either book or musical , but then again , i expecting case . rather , it overall tone film earned my enmity . begin , though i am well aware many animated features other family-themed features contain occasional sight gag or adul t-t hemed joke , tig seemed heavily punctuated them , beatnik scrap-sculptor dean mcchoppin unzipping his fly let young hogarth hughes " pet " squirrel escape his pants " bathroom " scene where hogarth tries cover robot hand it exits hughes home -- latter scene which least two instances what one could easily call " toilet-bowl humor . " not only , but i found protagonist himself just most obnoxious repulsive example lead character i ever come know : loud , unruly , disobedient brat reminiscent all four young charlie bucket tourmates willie wonka chocolate factory who tries pass himself off more depth than he really . honestly , he not what i would call " amiable , " " heart-warming , " or even " cute " ; such adjectives i'd rather reserve wide-eyed , honest , poverty-stricken mr. bucket . course , it not like i really appreciated any other human characters this flick , either -- not little mr. hughes ridiculously clueless diner waitress mother annie , nor deadbeat wannabe " artist " dean , nor even inept government agent whose name i completely ( yet thankfully ) forgotten despite his most complex earthling participant entire cartoon . such , only hundred-foo t-t all , metal-munching robot -- softhearted self-maintaining ( if nonetheless hopelessly brain-damaged ) extraterrestrial who no memory all his origin -- impressed me . even so , movie portrayed poor guy so incredibly dimwitted ( opposed haplessly misguided tad naive , which i hoping he'd come off ) effort make him likeable kids audience i ended up pitying him more than anything else . needless say , then , much i tried grapple each every one these elements they presented themselves , i merely found it harder harder get over accept them all collective whole , i ended up returning this movie video store utter disgust . believe me , ladies gentlemen , i really tried appreciate iron giant , but despite my efforts trying see side story its fans see it , all naught , now i am left asking myself just why i even bothered rent it first place . after all , it known one number very unpopular motion pictures 1999 , good reason : it caters very low level mentality , even amongst underdeveloped minds kids whom it made . tragically , so many other movies these days , regardless how successful or unsuccessful they -- current , seven-plus-year-long fad honestly disturbs me gets me wondering sensibility average person these days . worse yet how movie plagued such lowbrow buffoonery this one would " special edition " dvd five years after its initial release -- especially considering how allegedly few people actually seen it . oh , well ... i still wish i could've seen pete townsend iron man musical . least would something worth witnessing	-1

" adventures spin marty " title refers first season ( 1955-56 ) show ; second third seasons given modified title . when originally broadcast total running time 275 minutes broken into 25 episodes shown part first year " mickey mouse club " . show broadcast monday-friday 5pm-6pm . serials structured mild cliffhanger format teaser end enticing viewers watch next episode resolution . when they shown few years ago " vault disney " episodes paired up provide 22-23 minute running time . if you grew up original mmc you already know serials like this most anticipated part show " spin marty " far most popular . reason their popularity no mystery , they only kid shows those days featured kids instead puppets or animation . if you not around " spin marty " phenomenon , think it 1950 version " saddle club " , both featured kids getting spend all their time horses . but instead girls hanging out pine hollow stables , here it boys living bunk houses " triple " , dude ranch summer camp . who wouldn't like spending entire summer ranch , riding horses far away parental supervision ? first season story adapted novel " marty markham " lawrence watkin . show went rapidly downhill after first season so it no great tragedy only season one out dvd . mostly this because writers never able duplicate charm first season premise . but show also fell victim kevin corcoran curse . corcoran terminally precocious little actor disney tried make star inserting him into this popular show start second season . corcoran unbearably bad actor damage compounded disney insistence manipulative showcasing his terminal cuteness ; especially bad fit show whose first season appeal its naturalness understated performances cast . like " saddle club " first season , it revolves around new kid who difficulty fitting ranch . marty markham ( david stollery ) overprotected orphaned rich kid who arrives his grandmother chauffeured limousine his own butler ( perkins-j . pat o'malley-who detailed help ranch cook ) immediately manages offend all boys calling triple-r ranch " smelly old farm " . rivalry soon develops spin evans ( tim considine ) , popular boy who work all year pay attendance costs . marty afraid horses but lies polo player . considine stollery both convincing although stollery more difficult part . supporting cast boys appropriate nicknames ; lazy " ambitious " , freckled " speckle " chunky " russell muscle " . special effects bit weak ( like woodchuck chase scene where you accept ball fur pulled though field string woodchuck ) campfire scenes obvious day night shooting . harry carey jr. roy barcroft provide sympathetic concerned authority figures but my favorite insightful horse trainer ollie ( leonard geer ) who always seemed nine days worth stubble repeatedly said : " well i'll blue-nosed gopher " . predictably marty learns love horses get other boys . he breaks his arm but perkins able keep news his grandmother so he not sent home early . there all great summer camp elements bears ghost stories . two-disc dvd set photo gallery , interviews , little feature called " return triple-r " ; which includes adult considine stollery visiting ranch where most show filmed . then again , what i know ? i'm only child	1

new world least terrence malick limited filmography date , could best described monotone poem . it not exactly bad , just mundane rather forgettable even while you're watching it , more self-indulgence than genuine attempt communicate audience . visually it often seems surprisingly flat uninspired , while script comprises far too many trite voice over questions s-p-o-k-e-n v-e-r-y s-l-o-w-l-y i-n h-u-s-h-e-d t-o-n-e-s against selections his classical music collection , which doesn't magically render them profound but simply makes film evenly paced point where nothing stand out : even battle sequence takes time out more musings . big problem miscasting inexplicably prolific colin farrell , nice enough lad offscreen i'm sure but extraordinarily limited actor who just cannot carry picture no matter how many chances he given . true form he trots out his two `important picture ' expressions - bambi-caught-in-the-headlights-of-an-oncoming-car one one he thinks looks serious but simply makes him look like he not getting enough roughage his diet . fact he outshone q'orianka kilcher her first speaking part speaks volumes his inadequacy , although fair he worse . indeed , among male leads christian bale much , much more much , much less last third film , typically underused christopher plummer first third . malick very good madness mutiny infects deluded settlers jamestown , but because it happens people we've barely introduced it carries no emotional or dramatic weight . if anything , it just made me think how much more herzog could made it all . moments work , most notably expulsion `naturals ' their land brief latter sequences england , but evidence 135-minute version i very much doubt malick promised longer cut solve problems . i know it meant work art , but i just came away feeling i'd watched old very average universal international 50s western redubbed first-year philosophy students . only surprise jeff chandler his bouncing basques didn't crop up .	-1

** spoiler alert ! ** time most people got theater see this film , or rented it , they already knew ship its crew would dead less than two hours . surprisingly , this not diminish film power . even second or third viewing , film never delivers moment false , maudlin , or sentimental . plot not what keeps people engaged during this film . it issue . how people face death ? this film , people captain crew boat . they know commercial fishing difficult dangerous job , even when weather good . weather not good . men need money . they go out even though they know they meet storm . they used risking their lives every day . storm turns into hurricane traps men , kills them . they struggle save their own lives . they fail . when they neck deep water compartment overturned boat , they face death squarely . they talk , briefly , unsentimentally , things they not able , people they miss . stark , plainness acting achieves powerful effect . beginning film , viewer meets crew . repeated viewings , film shows nothing milked -- nothing artificial . men solid , working people . there no sappy foreshadowing . director deserves kudos maintaining iron-fisted control vehicle could campy . viewer learn lot meteorology . special effects indistinguishable live action . all actors , including george clooney , maintain stoic engagement life , they struggle live , no appeal our pity , until they dead . perfect storm more than film . it parable . one could invest such classic work art	1
i've this workout many times i've come really enjoy it . it broken into 3 sections : 1 ) warmup , upper body , stretch 2 ) warmup , lower body , stretch 3 ) warmup , abs , stretch . some people upper body , lower body , abs three separate days , so individual warmup benefit them . but i like total body one day , so i found individual warmup each section unnecessary . i only first warmup . i'll either fast forward other two warmups or take time res t.t his workout definitely not firm tradition compound exercises , i.e. squats into shoulder presses or lunges into bicep curls . each exercise isolated , which my kind strength training style . upper body section goes quickly . pushups , lat rows , bent over rows , shoulder presses , side front lateral raises , french presses , tricep kickbacks , bicep curls end it . most unique exercise bicep curls sitting fanny lifter . you bring dumbbell up halfway , not all way up like traditional bicep curl . different refreshing . lower body tough - all those squats , lunges , step-ups fanny lifter . squats step-ups seemed endless because my thighs so tired , but least means workout effective . abs pretty good . crunches , obliques , bicycles , planks . what i really like how stephanie tells you either use light , medium , or heavy weights each exercise . " squat get heavy weights . " that great idea . i like guided way . stephanie instructor soft-spoken quiet . she not dynamic instructor , but doesn't mean she dull . she still cues well says reasurring things like " that tough , " which i find myself nodding agreement . everyone wears purple tops black bottoms . when i first this workout , i disappointed boring music . it wasn't exciting rocking like i expect modern video . it sounded more like background music . but it grown me , some exercises actually match music , especially during abs section . set all white . floor light colored hardwood or laminate flooring . it modern but unfortunately lacks character . not big deal though . long workout good , that all matters . overall , i really like this video . i like gym style doing one exercise time doing total body one video tape	1

akira kurosawa made rashomon 1950 , ikiru 1952 seven samurai 1954 . all these films quite complex structure . yet ikiru remains very simple film , which says nothing original : it not what shown , but how , important , flaubert story " simple heart " . it appreciated best those who've realised they're going die ( you'll know what i mean ) . watching ozu tokyo story beforehand prepare you subtle style . ikiru five themes interwoven : 1 . learning accept deathat start film kanji watanabe ( takashi shimura ) learns he stomach cancer six months live . he retreated into his work after his wife early death become devoted routine . camera shows us several shots closeup shimura face after he speaks his doctor , we see anguish his eyes . it not fear he shows : it horror , horror what his life become . shock his wife death caused him stop living . shock his own coming death makes him realise he must start live : only then he ready die . there contrast documentary style depiction hospital scenes watanabe office compared closeups shimura , hunched up horrified realisation or showing eyes black pools despair . this hardest thing any art form : this simplicity , effect overwhelming , acting superb . 2 . placing value your lifewatanabe not much expertise how live . his son mitsuo ( nobuo kaneko ) daughter-in-law kazue ( kyoko seki ) share his home but not much else . watanabe cannot speak them his cancer . cast out his own resources , watanabe tells complete stranger ( yunosuke ito ) what he could not tell his son . he asks his burning question , how i live ? two drunken men go sample what they imagine life : drinking shops , reviews , dance halls , strip clubs . this desperate living , way dying . watanabe brings whole thing halt when he requests pianist play old song , sings words , young girls who fall love how they should enjoy love life short . perhaps it favourite he his wife when they first met . melody haunting , watanabe theme several key points film . later watanabe sees toyo ( miki odagiri ) one his office colleagues . watanabe exhilarated her joyous love life , her enthusiasm , even her appetite . perhaps she teach him how live . she teaches him he cannot live proxy . watanabe finally discovers fulfillment doing good others using his position work . kurosawa opens out sets progressively . we see small rooms watanabe house , then cafe dance hall scenes night , then streets shops day , then finally offices , streets slums watanabe moves company government heads departments , yakuza trying extort money them , fellow bureaucrats , workmen slum dwellers his quest children park built . giving meaning your life within everyone scope , no matter how narrow scope may , enlarges it . there touch moralist here , but we liable forget it we watch shimura , small , fragile , bowed over pain , absolutely determined make others respond . they . 3 . dangers griefhow watanabe become man he ? his bedroom photo young , attractive woman , his wife . flashback sequence we see her funeral , learn she died unexpectedly when her son only five or six years old . beautiful vanished . this theme haunting overtones japanese culture . power , greatness , beauty transient teach us how live more deeply . but watanabe given dead woman his love now he cannot stop grieving . watanabe bedroom photo next his citation exemplary attendance work . funeral car watanabe watches hearse draws further away him : it distance he tried deny ever since . 4 . entropy inherent large structureswatanabe started his bureaucratic life ambitions reform . his idealistic report mouldering away bottom drawer . but he working place where only activity filling out reports , not achieving change . it kind tomb . here no one accept responsibility ; anything unusual , such request group neighborhood mothers swamp filled made into playground , frantically passed department . this not merely satire . government , country local region , behaving watanabe , withdrawing living substituting empty formalism its place . it no accident watanabe head department . if we want we ask , it my problem too ? moralist much more evidence here . 5 . political response we others ' actionsthat watanabe not entire subject film made clear his death occurs halfway through it . we see buddhist wake . guests wake first give lip service watanabe virtues , then politicians among them compete credit building park . workers watanabe department discuss who next head . group petitioners admitted pay their respects . they say nothing ; but they grateful . japan it matters how dead thought . kurosawa shows all survivors , even grief stricken , motivated personal considerations . he shows this natural inevitable , while satirising more extreme manifestations it . mourners cannot give meaning their life praising watanabe though ; they need strive hard watanabe : most them won't . there social dimension our actions , our inactions . kurosawa wants viewers his film wake too , reflect what watanabe life death meant . watanabe dies his playground . he sits swing , sings his song young girls who fall love . it snowing . watanabe happy , not because playground , not because song . he found something vital . what makes ikiru important film viewers who watch it understand just what he found	1

if you're fan vampires , werewolves , action , or gothic suspense , this probably movie you'd interested checking out . while it not groundbreaking film , it highly entertaining one , one , me , something i rewatch several times per year . filming very attractive . everything dark , yet not so dark you can't see what going . movie gothic look it - sets , costumes , lighting . ( please don't mistake meaning gothic terms entertainment same thing gothic lifestyle . ) music , mostly heavy rock , fits well movie . action sequences expertly shot exciting watch . movie uses several techniques made popular " matrix " , but who cares ? it works perfectly within this movie . only downfall movie complete lack humor ... there not single joke entire thing ! everything so serious dark unless you're pretty good mood movie could really bring you down ... that how heavy it . set . added scenes provide more insight , special features treat , especially 45-minute documentary " fang vs . fiction " , which talks vampires werewolves . it very intriguing . if you're fan this movie you own dvd already , i would recommend selling it buying this version , it worth money	1

clint eastwood 1985 western " pale rider " obvious combination two earlier westerns : " shane " 1953 eastwood own " high plains drifter " 1973 . " pale rider " , no doubt , homage these films rather than rip-off . story : mysterious drifter clerical collar rides into town angel mercy local miner settlers angel punishment their rich oppressor his men . difference " pale rider " " shane " " pale rider " much more modern take same basic story ; plus , unlike " shane , " " rider " possesses supernatural element . although " shane " definitely better film historical sense , " rider " more entertaining experience modern viewers . hence , " pale rider " better film . comparisons " high plains drifter , " " pale rider " much better picture . " drifter " slow , tedious vibe all characters unlikable ( but two ) . eastwood plays mean anti-hero who enacts revenge entire town three villains ; he only displays kindness two people . " drifter " he solely agent vengeance . this not case " pale rider . " eastwood character " rider , " known only ' preacher , ' equal parts mysterious , intriguing , heroic supernatural . other words , viewer both likes roots ' preacher . ' noted above , " pale rider " features one most memorable lines cinematic history . megan , almost-15-year-old girl , informs preacher she thinks she loves him . preacher coolly responds : " nothing wrong . if there more love world there'd lot less dying .

i thought george stevens ' impeccably crafted literate greatest story ever told ( 1965 ) finest life jesus christ film . then i took look recently director nicholas ray king kings ( 1961 ) changed my mind . i don't know what best life jesus , but king kings charismatic sympathetic christ ( jeffrey hunter performance his career ) , great john baptist ( robert ryan ) , definitive salome dance ( luscious brigid bazlen ) ultimate sermon mount ( 7,000 extras spanish hillside ) , striking last supper disciples sitting y-shaped bench , strong crucifixion , reverent resurrection . 171 minutes ( including ten minutes miklos rozsa music ) , samuel bronston production seems ideal length tell story christ . screenplay oscar winner philip yordan . i often trouble ron randell roman lucius ; he major character here only cameo other biblical epics . same harry guardino barabbas . they , actuality , second third most important characters ray film . but both actors magnificent . lucius lets us inside roman power circle understand roman way thinking , so it nice his role big . barabbas answers question lot viewers may ponder , namely who this convicted killer whom crowd chose live while jesus died . movie , narrated orson welles , starts story pompey judea 63 b.c. this helps give us information what judea like several decades before jesus born . among superb supporting cast siobhan mckenna mary , royal dano peter , hurd hatfield pontius pilate , viveca lindfors herod antipas ' mistress , frank thring herod antipas , many more . sets costumes gloriously colorful ; what academy thinking when they not nominated oscars 1961 , no cast mermbers or screenplay ? rozsa music glorious . movie presented dvd 2.2 ratio 70mm super technirama . king kings powerful , intelligent , colorful , reverent . i think jesus himself would impressed it .	1

" i spit your grave " vile , sick , disgusting experience makes you feel unclean watching it . when it released 1978 , critics bashed it roger ebert calling it " vile piece garbage " gene siskel saying it one " most offensive movies i've seen my 11 years movie beat . " yet , it become certified cult classic isn't bad people build it up . true , it sick film through-and-through ... it seems like movie that trying depict how strong women , even though we watch women tortured raped not once , not twice , not three , but four f**king times . camille keaton ( grand-something buster ) plays jenny hill , writer who rents remote cabin country write novel . once there , four men take liking her ( one them retarded ) eventually they all rape her . this not one continuous scene four men each committing act , it four separate scenes . there first scene , then she crawls away , then it happens again , then she makes it her house , then it happens again . so so forth . movie only 100 minutes she doesn't begin her revenge trip until movie more than halfway through . usually " worst movies " ones where you tell someone entire plot it won't matter . true , if you're watching this film you know it woman who raped kills her four rapists . that truly all movie . when she commits last murder , movie ends . we , humans , fascinated macabre , disgusting , horrific . that why people watch movies like salo , pink flamingos , eraserhead , i spit your grave . yes , all these movies belong same category . although , theatrically , some those films listed better than others . say only sick people watch movies like this inaccurate watch films like this not wrong . yes , violence here exploited message it trying get across gets lost all blood , violence , castration occurs onscreen . " i spit your grave " not , definition , good film . it not film i want watch again , but horror film ( it horror film ) it pretty good . lots blood , lots violence , acting isn't half-bad , there lot skin ... you can't help but ( silently ) cheer keaton character when she gets her revenge men .

lady shanghi reputation secure classic film noir but then this genre notoriously disrespected probably because many film noirs based dime novels sound like it ; order appreciate film noir , therefore , you able enjoy kitschy quality snappy dime-novel dialogue . but kitsch alone not what makes ( some ) film noirs great . what really sets film noir apart other genres its striking , even elegant , visual style which often contrasts sharply its stark subject matter . film noir way glamourzing corruption , giving corruption unique aesthetic allure all its own . film noir probably owes something german expressionist film masters ( murnau , lang , von stroheim ) hollywood grotesques 20 30 but it absorbs evolves these influences into highly refined style its own . orson welles undisputed master high noir style . all his films after magnificent ambersons mobilize film noir methods techniques so welles ' reputation rises falls genre he not create but he perfected . film noir came age during wwii like many film noirs lady shanghai anxieties over race , class , sexuality , identity , this particular noir film , negotiating racial , social , cultural sexual difference increasingly globalized world . film takes place several international ( acapulco ) exotic ( chinatown ) settings these strange locales allow welles examine how his characters respond diverse array atmospheres social/cultural settings . welles himself plays central character film , michael o'hara , so he affects irish accent ( international touch ) , some critics argue , supposed sound false/inauthentic . o'hara way talking sounds bit too self-consciously literary ; though he affects working class worldliness his yarns sound like they come straight out conrad ( o'hara echoes many conrad colonial concerns ) hemingway ( o'hara echoes hemingway anti-franco sentiments ) so we suspect this character spent more time reading writing stories than actually working . whether we believe michael irish brogue authentic or not we know he fond creating fictions this casts suspicions his identity well his version events we hear voiceover . furthermore , we see his obsession literature given him taste romantic typically masculine posturing his favorite literary heroes instead making him worldly wise this just makes him all more gullible when pretty lady promise new adventure come . elsa ( played welles ' then-wife rita hayworth)identifies michael easy mark first time they meet . unlike michael elsa actually worldly we tell she seen experienced lot she knows lot world ( not just read lot it ) she sees through michael pseudo-brogue bravura right away knows exactly how exploit his romantic tendencies . she sums him up plays him first moment they exchange knowing glances ( hers much more knowing than his ) . michael prides himself his independence his integrity but he just can't help falling elsa pretend innocence helplessness -- its just too good resist -- he can't help wanting come charging her rescue even though there signs everywhere indicate elsa no need rescuing . first michael resists her job offer but she woman who always gets her way soon michael one her employee/servants just like all other men film . michael just can't tear himself away elsa dangerously seductive corruptive charms he willingly perhaps willfully misinterprets innocence helplessness only because version her makes him feel better his own true motives . michael hired extra hand elsa husband yacht soon he steps foot deck everyone else aboard sizes him up begins figuring how they use him further their own plots . elsa husband bannister famous lawyer both he his partner grisby , like michael , under elsa spell trying plot their way out captivity . yacht pulls out harbor we see word " circe " written bold letters yacht hull . elsa past secret only hinted ( all we know she born island somewhere east spent some time shanghai ) . she looks like penultimate american blonde but she not america her cultural reference points decidely eastern contrast michael western points reference ; michael she represents unknown perhaps unkowable , this part her allure also what makes her so dangerous . " elsa " prototypical femme fatale conventions film noir genre tell us things not end well anyone gets too close but she just too enticing . most famous scene film elsa sleek black bathing suit diving off some perilous rocks if she accustomed such danger if danger her natural element . but then she lays down sunbathe rocks relative safety boat michael looking , anxiously aware how dangerous she , allow himself comforting illusion she vulnerable she needs saving only he save her not only all other male predators board , but save her her own eastern imbued fatalistism . elsa so beautiful she all men film believing exactly what she wants them believe all them believing they've actually got chance her . men all slowly lose their head around her . some men talk down her but still they what she says she all them plotting against each other while lighting her cigarettes . film criticized impossibly tangled plot but i think point film you never supposed certain or not whether elsa merely defending herself against men who want control her or if elsa control all them ( just like she control michael ) start . even end we still want believe elsa victim something , perhaps something her past she just can't escape , but since we don't know what her past we no ultimate insight into what driving her all nor matter we any insight into what originary crime or sin driving men all ; all we know sexes races classes odds . elsa remains unknown all way through michael once ensnared must realize he too unknown because under her influence he forced act against what he perceived his own true nature . lady shanghai offers some most stunning visuals any film noir i know . acapulco scenes especially exciting danger unpredictability foreign woman made especially inviting exciting foreign land . this film welles offers ultimate noir vision anxiously uncertain men women attracted each other but also repelled what they find themselves attracted what they find themselves doing name desire . its film noir means film follows certain recognizable conventions but it more than simply follow those conventions , it pushes those conventions far they pushed explores nature those conventions more thorough way than any noir before or , arguably , since . end film characters become lost their own plots no longer know who they this conveyed brilliantly welles use masks mirrors celebrated luridly twisted funhouse scene which feels bit like famous dali sequence hitchcock spellbound but even more disorienting disconcerting ( spellbound released 1945 so it possible , even likely , welles seen it it influenced his own film made 1946 released 1948 ) . [ extra featurette follows film we learn welles himself painted much funhouse props set . ] there lot bad noirs out there these give genre bad name but few good ones among best films ever made . welles ' reputation would greater if film noir better understood appreciated not genre cheap dime novels inspired it but genre where cinema explores its own methods techniques . great directors lang von stroheim welles hitchcock godard chabrol other new wave auteurs all attracted noir this reason . brilliant film . after this film ( which commerical flop ) welles didn't work america ten years when he return america he made touch evil ( brilliant noir film ) . touch evil also failed generate revenue effectively ended welles career mainstream director even though he continued make independently financed small pictures like othello , macbeth , trial chimes midnight .	1

this one my all-time favorites movie made me fall adoration myrna loy . thin man first " oldie " flick i saw 10 year old , although sophisticated innuendos went over my head then , it still ingrained me love preference old movies hollywood golden age . much talk already said detailing stars ' chemistry plot itself . but i still wanted show my support this classic so i thought i'd contribute some hopefully interesting facts trivia re thin man . this second pairing william powell myrna loy , first manhattan melodrama ( 1934 ) . but t'was thin man cemented their star status hollywood . wonderful rapport two selling point movie ( sorry , dashiell hammett ) , rendering mystery plot secondary importance ( something missing , possibly murdered inventor ) . myrna loy 80 films , silent sound , mostly playing " other women " exotic vamps , before thin man came her way . mgm reluctant co-star myrna loy thin man , feeling myrna wasn't right role . also , time constraints played part studio plans star her stamboul quest , which begins filming 3 weeks . director woody " one-take " van dyke threatened walk out mgm relented but one condition : thin man completed under 3 weeks . van dyke finished 16 days . myrna played her last exotic role stamboul quest never looked back . thin man offered two unprecedented elements . firstly , film played up folks fun murder second , two leads portrayed wisecracking , happily wedded couple who witty , refined relished married . movies back then would normally their couples getting out marriage or ending up married finale . no one before actually explored realm hip happily wedded husband wife body film . mgm executives very nervous first preview film , unsure movie reception . but they needn't worried . van dyke knew what he wanted . he instructed albert hackett frances goodrich , husband-and-wife screenwriters , focus nick nora relationship pay lesser attention murder mystery . thin man series proven training ground young , up-and-coming actors . after thin man ( 1936 ) co-stars jimmy stewart , oozing his soon-to-be-patented aw-shucks sincerity , while shadow thin man ( 1941 ) features lovely , wholesome donna reed co-starring role . this first thin man , course , showcases gamine maureen o'sullivan . myrna loy recalled cast never allowed make friends various wire-haired terriers who played asta , it might distract thespian dogs . thin man doesn't refer nick charles but lanky , cranky inventor murder victim clyde wynan t.t here 72-episode thin man television series ( 1957-59 ) starring peter lawford phyllis kirk . before william powell immortalized nick charles , he played gentleman detective philo vance canary murder case ( 1929 ) , greene murder case ( 1929 ) , benson murder case ( 1930 ) kennel murder case ( 1933 ) . novel thin man dashiell hammett excellent short mystery novel . while not witty funny movie , it still very good read . unfortunately , unlike movie version , book never spawned sequel .	1
i loved " children corn " ! it wasn't scary , but characters especially intimidating . it also comes little bits both humor pity . example , humor mistakes made making . i could point out 5 first time i saw it ! there not much humor script . sad parts movie course when some people die . it sad when all parents adults die , because without them innocent children helpless . you can't help but feel little sorry isaac when he devoured " he who walks behind rows " , even though isaac bad guy . i would reccomend this movie someone who really nothing friday night wants evil kid action doesn't mind corny special effects . not put time off your schedule just watch this movie . it good movie only when it should , that when you hour half free time . also , don't see sequals ; they're absolutely , undeniably , stunningly terrible !!! you could probably watch them if you desperatly bored out your mind . anyway , first one best . besides some gorey parts , saddening child adult deaths , hokey movie resolution , this movie beatiful story mainly loving couple who meet two kids while driving throgh nebraska	-1

written fellow who gave world " monkeybone " ( sam hamm ) directed gentleman responsible " loony tunes : back action " ( joe dante ... okay , okay , he also " gremlins " ) , " homecoming " yet " masters horror " misfire . this time around , story concerns world where right-wing political pundits inadvertantly cause dead american soldiers come back life . david murch ( jon tenney ) jane cleaver ( thea gill doing her best anne coulter imitation ) offer up typical republican soundbites defense ( tactfully unnamed ) president ill-advised war iraq . one those soundbites ? " i wish those soldiers could come back , because i'm sure they'd tell america how proud they serve give their life this great country ours . " or something effect . what you know ? republicans get their wish . course , zombie soldiers aren't glad they're dead . what their idea vengeance ? they demand right vote against president . that right . soon their dissenting ballots cast , they drop lifelessly floor , their point made . this little vignette makes its point first seven minutes filming , then it just keeps making it over over again . some said your enjoyment show depend your political bent , but i think any clear-headed individual see no matter your governmental ideologies , this just one long , slow , poorly-written joke . there some dark humor here , but it also unintelligent , hateful , obvious . ah well . propaganda isn't known its tact . " homecoming " vendetta , that all it . i'm all exposing corruption deceit , but even if there those who agree this film message ( many , many ) , i fail see how those same people also agree film self-righteous moralizing , its hate , its presumption . after all , this little " screw you " current administration props up its high horse idea conservatives only promoting their own selfish agendas claiming speak america fallen men women . but " homecoming " guilty exact same offense . last frame , it obvious no one show aware self-defeating irony their proselytizing , which really only horrific thing this turkey	-1

i'm werewolf nut horror movie fan , but what really makes this movie characters their interactions . ginger bridgette very compelling poigiant . there few cliches , like hightened sexuality wolves experience . i didn't really like part it because it just too traditional but rest it wonderful . whole thing very unsettling stays you . how they deal gradual transformation interesting becasue she doesn't just start turning into violent sexual beast , if anything alters but enhances ginger personality . i highly recommend it	1
" antwone fisher " powerful moving film . i seen this film numerous time especially hbo it very true life . i imagine actual process antwone risking finding his " roots " coming terms his birth family based more than three psych sessions . there much said good psychotherapy . more african american women men suffer untold anguish keeping harsh realities life themselves under misconception " strong ! " while suffering illnesses mind . oscar winner , denzel washington impressive job his directorial debut . there many scenes which i enjoyed watching . they included beginning ( dreams little boy - check out gigantic-sized pancakes ! ) ending ( dreams turned into reality ) , which beautifully tied story together . addition directorial responsibilities , mr. washington continues show why he won oscar award successful all his acting roles . he strong presence this movie . all actors represented their parts well . actor , derek luke demonstrated why he so right part antwone fisher . he portrayed very real hear t-t ugging work . joy bryant who played part cheryl , antwone love interest , resembled ray sunshine screen . chemistry flowed well romantic characters . my favorite scene happened when young man finally confronted his mother her reaction towards him . priceless . novella nelson who played part mrs. tate , despicable character , deserves special mention . although we only see her few minutes , actress who played fisher mother gave outstanding performance . antwone fisher shouldn't overlooked , highly recommended my list .	-1

" conversation " little seen masterpiece francis ford coppola , made " godfather " " godfather pt . ii . " it mystery-drama , plays like horror movie similar nicolas roeg film " don't look now " sense works dread , rather than fright . two-time academy award winner gene hackman plays harry caul , wiretapper whom we first meet he recording conversation young couple park . caul sees his job job , he doesn't get involved people he records nor he pay much attention details conversation . he supposed record it deliver it . his suspicions begin grow tape when he tries personally deliver it mysterious person who asked it instead badgered man assistant ( harrison ford ) it . same time we begin realize how bad caul his job . his partner stanley ( john cazale ) quit already began working wiretapper . superintendent his apartment building managed get inside his multi-locked apartment drop off birthday present . ladyfriend his tells harry time she watched his spying someone hour ... it no wonder when rival wiretapper comes his office him he manages record intimant conversation harry woman . while mystery revolving around " conversation " continues , harry begins deciphering some sentences his suspicions confirmed when he hears sentence : " he'd kill us if he got chance ? " this question fuels rest movie , until very creepy superb climax . some most haunting parts film come end this due visuals film . one much-talked scene comes when harry flushes toilet motel room it begins overflowing blood . this scene ( few follow it ) some most effectively creepy scenes i've seen long time . gene hackman superb harry caul , multi-layered character page must seemed very one-dimensional . harry man no personal life , almost no friends , he man lives shrouded mystery . coppola already proved time this movie came out he cinematic genius , but he mostly known movies like " godfather " " apocalypse now . " those films 3 hour long epic films , but i think really see how much range coppola director it nice take look " conversation .

wow this bring back memories ! this probabely one movie i most obessed little kid . i watched it constantly acted it out my own my little pony toys . i bet my dad looks this movie dread now because i can't even count times i made him sit thru it play it out me ! he probabely still remebers each line heart ! " snooz coming ! snooz coming ! " silly .. sadly when i tried showing it children i babysit , they not too impressed . i suppose it only good children who grew up it toys because children i showed it simply not care seeing characters or even recognized them . seeing your favourite toy movie must its appeal when it first released 1980s . doesn't mean those kids i showed it didn't enjoy it completely though . they liked parts those 2 bratty witches , wanted see my old my little pony collection . i suppose it simply going one those movies only good during certain time . but what you expect ? it one those movies born out popular toyline . my little ponies making comeback now ( this time around they look cute , unlike their last comeback 1997-1999 ) , so this movie may interest those fans well . but those who don't like toys , it probabely won't . hence why i only gave it 4 stars	-1

i owned wild orchid quite few years beginning thought it bit out there . some it doesn't fit , some it doesn't make sense some it just plain dumb . reason i gave it 4 stars because i like mickey rourke . even though he look bit beat up this movie kind scary looking first slicked down hair he practically oozing sex . carre otis character , emily , seems bit aloof childlike . she bombarded scenes people sex abandoned building , watching 2 people sex limo . wheeler ( mickey rourke ) almost seems enjoy watching emily squirm bit . wheeler sort detached , but wanting someone he trust . its tough make sense this movie because honestly best part end . now i unrated version so it shows more than r-rating ( movie like this one - unrated or nc-17 way go)-the part where wheeler emily make love finally . it very arousing say least . i must give it zalman king . he knows how far go where movie gets into your mind , but yet he doesn't go gratuitous sex . i suggest delta venus , which zalman king experience	-1

one most impressive things criterion dvd label its willingness select offbeat challenging titles . film inclusion criterion collection , fact , almost guarantees it seen more diverse group viewers than might originally sought dvd out . this good thing , or bad thing , ( but usually good ) especially titles really only appeal specific target audience . such case experimental documentary " symbiopsychotaxiplasm . " i think individuals fascinated creative art filmmaking intrigued entertained -- specifically film students , scholars , theorists , documentarians , like . casual viewers , however , film appeal may somewhat limited -- so i recommend you know what you're getting into before you purchase this dvd . dvd set contains two films --" symbiopsychotaxiplasm : take one " " symbiopsychotaxiplasm : take 2 1/2 . " " take one , " shot 1968 , director william greaves takes full film crew new york central park . there he films various actors tackling fairly provocative script sex relationships . scenes depicted , over over , reminiscent second rate tennessee williams ' script their melodrama psychosexual dialogue . employing different cameras , he not only films actors , but himself , members crew , patrons park ( specifically those he feels represent some aspect what enacted ) . it chaotic set where no one really knows what going -- but it fascinating look process action . crew know greaves trying all-encompassing documentary , but differing opinions its intent or what form it should take . without greave knowledge , then , they start rebel -- filming meetings themselves debating merits theory behind greave vision ( or lack thereof ) . it messy look people who passionate film trying make sense what they doing . " take 2 1/2 , " we pick up much same way . first 40 minutes captures more footage shoot " take one . " second half , however , shows film finally released film festival -- 35 years later ! now participants who reunited still trying articulate significance " symbiopsychotaxiplasm . " greaves calls it metaphor vietnam , but no one else who involved make connection . after festival , greaves crew ( steve buscemi ) set out recreate experience . crew , knowledge project previous film , fail generate much passion or drama--they're just doing their jobs . what we get , however , extended sequence two actors really going improv get heart their characterizations . it might one most evocative depictions real actors working their craft i've ever seen . i know i've probably too descriptive ( or not enough , i don't even know) -- but films truly difficult describe . if you like film process ( or acting process ) watching it detail , this might useful film . if you like see or participate debate meaning film other aspects film theory , this film might stimulate your intellect . film also stands interesting , but not overt , look racism , sexism some other societal mores inherent sixties artistic community . i actually enjoyed these films , but recognize they not everyone . this experimental film no beginning or end , no major revelations or commentaries . everyone likely take something different out viewing experience -- so i'll leave you . kgharris , 02/07 .	-1

playtime depicts monsieur hulot day city . hulot ( jacques tati ) spends his day trying make appointment city , which takes place busy downtown paris very modern building wide windows , work cubicles , robot-like secretaries resembling flight attendants . hulot not quite meet his contact , his experience like cat mouse game . addition , through out film he comes across group stereotypical american tourists who hop off bus their cameras hand capture parisian landscape well natives city . indeed , playtime comedy absurd falls lines chaplinesque film meets warner brother cartoon . film quite humorous unusual . hulot seldom speaks clear language , but rather mumbles or grunts incomprehensible ; one watches , there no need subtitles because tati emphasizes characters ' actions rather than what they say . his trenchcoat , hat , pipe , umbrella , hulot carries charlie chaplin buster keaton tradition -- misfit-like character who happens go his business , but somewhere way , mayhem ensues . all day , hulot roams building , rides bus , end day , he ends up new nightclub full chaos funny business , which may resemble something out marx brothers film . playtime may depict hulot entire day . however , it obvious jacques tati , who also directed film , may attempting make social commentary state france during 1960s . particular , paris its relations western world -- united states . this modern paris always known place fun romance rather than consumerism or commercialism . however , playtime shows ever-changing paris its physical architecture romance world market . tourists visit super store , hulot ventures consumer-like convention where vendors promoting their wares . one brief significant scene film shows reflection eiffel tower window , later same window shows us capitol building . viewers watch film , one may observe hulot character part landscape , somewhat fixture imagination . nevertheless , playtime full humor , may interest viewers who like charlie chaplin or buster keaton type films little french twist .	1

this very entertaining dvd , full action very well constructed filmed battle scenes great scope . some ways film very timely considering there tension current western civilization america europe islamic world stretches across asia . i found it interesting film depicts those christians who tolerant multicultural diverse nation those christians not tolerant other religious beliefs . this film , balian ( played orlando bloom ) , his father , king jerusalem ( pitiful leper hiding behind silver mask ) represent those forces live diversity spiritual beliefs . templar knights represent those forces not live diversity multiculturalism it threatens them . this film , muslims powerful military force also diverse tolerance or non-tolerance christians . it beautiful film , fascinating architecture , set construction , weapon costume design . battle city jerusalem exciting , dramatic high point , critical aspect film . saladin wins battle jerusalem handed over muslims . remember after death jesus , apostles disciples spread christianity into egypt ethiopia , into rome , france , spain , england , ireland . also christianity spread into eastern europe such romania , hungary , germany . christianity spread into present day syria , jordan , iraq , iran . thus sweep islam across world around year 600 brought islam christian communities cities across middle east . it response this growing islamic power dominance over middle east 700 years crusades waged - which primary theme film . yet this not christians hate muslims who turn hate christians type film . instead writers film-makers imply kingdom heaven attainable here earth through belief tolerance other beliefs god . this actually good message our day time - which director ridley scott obviously knows	-1

i heard it said many times no addiction starts out physical dependancy ; addiction really begins psycological/spiritual defect deep down inside . i think way movie beginning showed insecurity unease two main characters most underrated aspect this brilliant film . alcohol washes away unease pain awhile , but when mask wears off , literally , all hell breaks loose !! some commented jack lemmon greenhouse scene subsequent mental-ward scene not realistic . i disagree this , i think his character mental state such complete breakdown very real possibility point story . ultimately , this film more than just story dangers alcoholism . it story dangers low self-esteem not loving yourself . true breeding ground addiction , i don't know if there ever film more effective job illustrating this !! absolute classic ... one ages !!	1

i really enjoyed this film . factory fan , i hesitant get this , perhaps due off-putting title . but i'm glad i . acting great , especially actor who played warhol himself - dead . also , ms. taylor 100% believable unfortunate , demented , freaky valarie solanas . i notice lot negative reviews this other films consist rant film worst they ever saw , waste 2 hours , etc ., but these folks never explain why they didn't like it . this true some bad reviews here . additionally , i'm not sure filmmaker harron not taking blantant stance against scum manifesto constitutes endorsment it ; rather opposite . it seems me solanas ' rants so out there crazy it isn't necessary say " hey , this wrong/bad/whatever . " her insane writtings speak themselves . why people need spoon fed obvious ? while not masterpiece ( hence 4 stars ) , this certainly good movie fascinating subject . it clearly not everyone , some reviews here illustrate . if you into warhol , 60 radicalism , art scene , or varried social movement called feminism , you'll like this movie . if not , this film not you	-1

anjelica huston , julianna marguelies joan allen bring life fabulous tale marion zimmer bradley . sterling performances engaging tale keep you glued your seats thorugh this seemingly short three hour saga . those who trouble book , this movie presents it well . while not completely true current arthurian research , tale captivating , presents window into world where struggle paganism christianity might taken place . facts show arthur merlin might much more christian oriented than mists avalon depict , but one imagine this struggle occur sometime , who , how when questions only answered imagination	1
singin rain arguably best movie musical all time , not just because music but because entire package - premise , comedy , characters - everything here works together make you feel better any time you sit down watch it . it ironic this movie thrown together quickly capitalize success " american paris " , since improvisational feeling movie one things makes it so much fun . although this film number ten top 100 films all time compiled american film institute , it wasn't nominated best picture year its release , 1952 . although it well box office , it would over twenty years before people would look back realize just what great motion picture it . perhaps because 1970 such bleak cynical years , movies largely matched mood , people eager rediscover fun motion picture viewing experience could . movie focuses period time which entire motion picture film industry nervous transition silent talking pictures . although movie compresses time this respect - transition actually took three years - it accurately describe technical problems era their comical aspects . there overabundance musicals first batch talking films , many stars heavy accents made their speech undecipherable or voices came across like nails chalkboard like lina lamont ( jean hagen ) saw their careers ruined , early sound technology itself so fragile you would often see actors speaking potted plants or coat racks comic effect . preview silent picture team lockwood lamont first talkie , " dueling cavalier " , one most hilarious scenes film . it pretty typical what you would see such early talking picture - dialogue going out sync , actors actresses strutting around wildly gesturing if nobody hear them , dialogue still resembled what you would read off title cards silent film - " i love you , i love you , i love you " . all this one reasons singin ' rain never get dated - it comic nostalgic look very narrow period time . this movie fun outside its comic take movie history , though . one , it hard say who steals show most , since there so many thieves involved . most notably there jean hagen - who actually very acceptable speaking voice - evil silent star who can't accept her days numbered . then there 27 year-old donald o'connor cosmo , studio music director sidekick gene kelly character whose youthful exuberance really shines number " make ' em laugh " all his goofy facial expressions . he seems much fun audience . finally , there all great dance numbers music , capped probably one most famous scenes all time - gene kelly rendition title number perfectly captures joy man who just fallen love feels he world his feet . you just can't watch this film not come away smile your face . it good soul chicken soup , just lot more fun .	1
this very good movie . great actors very good ending .	1
when i first saw this film 1982 , it reminded me one david lean epics . like lawrence arabia or dr. zhivago , it tells story nations political movements perspective single person . cast top notch , acting superb ( ben kingsley amazing this role ) , photography gorgeous . so it must-see film , but what dvd ? word , terrific ! sound color all look wonderful , extra features informative . i cannot say how this dvd edition compares one came out five years ago , but if you don't already own dvd copy this film , you won't disappointed this one	1

i'm fan miike , but _izo_ just too much . there no plot whatsoever , just poor unfortunate reincarted samurai wandering through time space killing everyone who crosses his path . that it ! end sentence ! if you think you stand over two hours this , give it try . if you're looking something even rudimentary plot , you might want try something else , like _audition_ or _ichi killer_ . i'd rather watch incomprehensible _gozu_ again than forced sit through _izo_ . it beautifully-photographed , but ultimately pointless film . maybe 6th or 7th other film miike directs this year more interesting	-1

we become world almost obsessed appearances . we lead believe if we look or dress certain way then we accepted who we . we all told " beauty only skin deep " but how many us really believe this way ? how many times you seen overly obese person grocery store cheetos pastries beer their cart thought yourself , " good job , tubby , keep it goin ' ... " i mean , i'm not putting myself up some golden pedastel , because i often made many judgments others simply because way they looked which kind makes me sad admitting this because i often judged way i looked growing up i totally resented those people who said stuff stuff just humiliate me try make me feel bad myself . no , i wasn't obese , but i very skinny . i stood 6'1 " weighed 105-106 whopping 107 if i didn't take dump day . you probably imagine ridicule i went through day day out . out frustration anger humiliation , i ended up working out . now you might say others ridiculing me turned out very positive experience . not positive you might think . i found these same people ridiculed me couple years before now wanted chummy me now i buffed incredibly good looking ... okay ... maybe i just buffed , but even though i appearance someone who strong confident , inside i still this insecure skinny kid who used run home school tears his eyes wondering why people didn't just like me who i . this movie really hit home both my wife myself because even though she grew up east coast i grew up west coast , our stories remarkably similar even though hers opposite . my wife incredibly beautiful woman inside well outside , but she weight " challenge " she still one . she very careful what she eats make sure she gets her exercise or pounds come back . but i love her her . she not her weight . she human deserves love , appreciation , respect . you might think this film hokey , it not terribly funny , but message very clear . look beyond what outer into inner soul person . there very touching scene i would like attempt describe before i go . hal ( jack black ) goes into hospital rosie ( gwyneth paltrow ) volunteer work . he under " spell " rosie most gorgeous woman he ever met he meets this little girl . he sees little girl tells her she prettiest little girl he ever met . she , very pretty little girl . after spell broken , he goes back into same hospital little girl goes , " hal ! hal ! don't you remember me ? " it same little girl but this time he sees her burn victim he witnesses all scars all over her body , " you told me i prettiest girl you'd ever seen ... " he holds her his arms , " you're right , princess , you ... you ... " under " spell " hal saw right through people into their heart ... their spirit ... their soul ... hal saw people they really . now you might think that load sentimental mush it this movie geared toward mushy side , but it really very important message we need hear over over again ; we not packaging ... we what inside ... even obvious sentimentality going this film , i some genuine belly ( no pun intended ) laughs goin ' . there scene where hal smears vaseline all over his eyes tells rosie , " uhhh ... i contagious conjunctivitis ... but i'll okay ... " i don't know why i thought so funny , but if there one thing jack black knows how very dry very understated . he actually very good choice this part . even when he " " , his humor very subtle just creeps up you you think back go , " wow ... funny ... " this movie same way . i found myself thinking certain parts just laughing . it good film it great message even though we all heard , " beauty eye beholder " million times our lives , we really need start acting though it truth , because it . it our light within makes us truly shine brightly . peace blessing	-1

i am quite new pilates though i've doing yoga daily past nine years . i'm finding pilates nice addition yoga it really works your body different but complementary way . i recently bought four dvd disc set stott i've " basics " previously this " flat ab " dvd today found them both excellent ! it bit long side , around 50 minutes , so it not quickie sort deal . it incredibly well chaptered , fact every exercise chaptered so you exercises you want if you don't feel like doing whole thing ( but warm ups really important before jumping into other exercises ) . i definitely aware my core during after doing this program , it definitely delivers it promise ! course if you overweight you need eat healthy lose weight order truly get flat abs , no amount exercise give you if you don't combine it good nutrition ( this something i've learned experience ) . however , you strengthen your core doing this program ! referring previous review this program , i didn't find it overly slow moving all , rather it paced way flowed but challenging . personally i don't like it when programs forcibly rushed sake saving time . i'd rather part program like this her pacing than rush through practice tries squeeze everything too quickly sacrifice good instruction form . there other programs out there shorter practices may appropriate someone who time conscious but what i've seen they just fewer exercises which grouped according body part you want focus rather than rushing through too many exercises while sacrificing form . anyway , i am very impressed this other stott program i've worked so far i'm looking forward trying other programs set	1

after reading sven nykvist just died i decided look fanny alexander again after 23 years . he cinematographer this film very interested capturing light darkness . this film quarter century old . our digital ideas film cinematography certainly changed well our morals . i just so carried away wonderful story delightfully unconventional , today standards , disfunctional family philanderers contrasted extrodinarily harsh fundamentalist protestant family contrasted family almost magical jews . i don't believe this film could remade today it pity our moral culture changed so .	1
this film version tale two cities masterpiece -- it faithful adapts dickens ' classic novel while holding out worthwhile movie its own right through incredible performances its lead actors . plot novel not touched -- filming dickens ' most tightly-plotted novel , good decision . acting uncommonly good . sydney carton fabulously ; james wilby commended wonderful nuanced performance . i also found madame defarge particularly well-done ; actress playing her scary ! considering mme . defarge character book , i think her almost insane bitterness sharp purpose well-portrayed . couple unique things this film include its use french actors play french characters british actors play british characters . no contrived accents , people actually look their nationality -- both important such highly political story . i also strongly support decision carton darnay played different people ; yes , they're supposed look alike , but not identical . different actors play them facilitates portrayal their very contrasted characters . i am admittedly coming perspective one who read loved book years before seeing movie ; i can't judge what this film would like someone who never read novel . but i found it accurate sensitive adaptation book i know love , i imagine beauty story would appeal just easily someone experiencing story first time	1

john ford filmmaker who much praised many derided good many others . chief criticism seems lie his treatment indians sterotypical inferiors , prone same type predictable behaviour film after film . most strange , ford always used white man chief indian his films . i tend find this criticism accurate . i also find certain his westerns lack gritty realism , say , peckingpah work , border preposterous . ford use exterior settings , however , peerless , rock monolith bordering his town tombstone " my darling clementine " ( 1943 ) awe inspiring . i wouldn't rate ford top ten , but i'd rank this film among great westerns considered american classic . course , this telling " shootout ok corral " earps ( henry fonda , ward bond ) doc holliday ( victor mature ) versus clantons ( walter brennan ) . some reason , westerns fonda quieter resonance than most i really like this . i give john ford credit this one . it filled many fine , small details - acting seems more subdued , even little melancholy - yet he uses vast space arizona desert only ford , without peer . use title song played qiuetly background , , even better , hummed time time henry fonda . fonda different wyatt earp than ones we've seen fairly recently " tombstone " ( 1993 ) " wyatt earp " ( 1994 ) , less violent , more gentleman , , film progresses , somewhat shy admirer doc holliday old girl friend ( clementine , course ) back east . fonda played " ox-bow incident " " clementine " within one year time period , , though he primary character these two films , he also blended adroitly lot other very good actors actresses . tip hat him well ford . i don't believe ford version earp saga very accurate , but , when movie this well , who cares ? final scene memorable its downcast last meeting wyatt clementine , when they finally express little their feelings each other , fonda kisses her cheek , then rides off , dissolving into immensity arizona landscape . almost bought tear my eye . john ford directed many good great films inspite above reservations , but this john ford his absolute best	1

when i first saw first x-men movie i highly impressed special effects , but plot nearly bored me tears . but i can't say x2 : x-men united . this outing , there several good plots here , all them leading spectacular action scenes . chief among these william stryker ( advisor president ) his plan kill off all mutants : first initiating attempt president life more than it seems first , then using knowledge he gains magneto , who imprisoned his all plastic cage since end first movie . once he knows all cerebro , professor xavier special computer locating mutants , he then captures professor forces him attempt kill all mutants . plot involves wolverine attempt learn his past stryker . trying learn his past , wolverine encounters vicious female version himself equipped his own powers regeneration claws boot . his battle her not missed . there yet plot where magneto attempts turn stryker plan around kill all humans instead mutants . all these elements more fit beautifully together this film where we introduced new characters like nightcrawler pyro , we see loss (?) one core x-men characters . this much better movie than it predecessor -- 135 minute , nearly two half hours -- it much longer movie , too , but one that well worth watching . it would nice if few lose ends tied up , but i guess then there wouldn't anything sequel you just feel coming .	1

probably most over-looked trois couleurs trilogy , principally because it one middle different tone bleu rouge , trois coleurs blanc bleak comedy inequality troublesome relationships . karol karol , played sublime bemusement zbigniew zamachowski , serious trouble his soon-to-be ex-wife dominique ( ice-maidenly julie delpy ) . she his bank account frozen , left him nothing . so karol goes back his homeland poland begins plot fiendish revenge . three colours white probably more common kiewslowski tv series morality plays , dekalog [ worth your attention ! ] than it other two films series . it less stylised , filmed straightforward , almost documentary style it - like couple those dekalog shorts - grim , dark comedy ethics . kieslowski always maintained he no great moralist . he didn't claim any answers way people lived their lives ; he just found subject interesting liked ask questions himself his audiences . this , part , what gives his films their deep humanity . white bursting humanism . decision film it more straightforward style apparently came because kieslowski acknowledge colour white most difficult film , so notion building symbolic colour-scheme around it ( he blue red other two films ) seemed too difficult . this indicative his technical ability director , which despite less " showy " schemata white still oozes out screen . this great director top his game . comedy three colours white [ trzy kolory bialy polish , way , language film mostly ] mostly comes its absurd plo t-t wists , which heaped top each other until you can't help but laugh ... but emotions very real , very recognisable even while you're guffawing idea man going france poland suitcase someone he hardly knows . while i think it would fair say this middle installment not impressive blue or red it still very thoughtful , very clever piece film-making most writers directors would give their right-arm involved . it takes sideways look its theme - white french flag represents " liberty " - gives discerning viewer pause reflection . kieslowski not spoon-feed his audiences , even rather straightforward narrative such this , so viewer left make up his or her own mind certain things . example : dominique love karol after all ? it excellent european cinema its influence seen many works followed since - surprisingly enough perhaps work lars von trier , who also goes uncomfortable laughs , occasional absurdism slantwise looks morality ethics . extras disc also worth . it fascinating see kiewslowski talk his life his work such detail ( he didn't leave anything his movies chance deeply thoughtful man . shame he didn't think quitting chain-smoking , he may lasted longer ! ) adds your enjoyment his work . this well worth taking look .	-1

this movie pretty awful . since i am ranking it 1 star , then according reviewer i must not soul . hey , it doesn't feel bad ! this movie worst black stereotyping any movie i ever seen , particularly sci-fi movie . it worse than blaxploitation films 70 , which least entertaining . this movie group teenage white kids , one token black thrown just hell it . " but just how ' black ' he ?, " you may wondering . well movie makes it clear he true soul man because it goes out its way establish these facts : 1 . he talks different whites . ( " hey bodee . " " his name bodhi ! " " well you say it your way , i'll say it mine . " or something effect . ) 2 . he breakdances . ( we all know all black people breakdance , can't they ? )3 . he likes basketball . ( again , every white person knows black people all like basketball they all good it , right ? )4 . he raps . ( because person isn't truly black unless they little hip-hop , they ? )i'm white guy . i'm not overly sensitive racism issues . but watching this movie really surprised me . i amazed see such blatant black stereotype . i can't say it good thing . it quite embarassing watch , actually . what where they thinking ? this movie would never made way today day age . movie itself pretty lame . it made back roller-blading / cyberpunk craze 80 . it usual bleak dystopian future typical those movies those days . it also features funky little ball named bodhi . it weirdest , most nonsensical story i ever watched . it almost like bad dream somebody wrote down soon they woke up , which later worked into screenplay . this movie so stupid it painful watch . only good reason see it see few young actors such jason patric ( lost boys ) jami gertz ( lost boys , twister , still standing ) . it also nice see richard jordan ( logan run ) , well stunning sarah douglas ( superman ii , conan destroyer ) starring villainess roll , usual . sarah douglas really make good villain , too . it too bad her talent so wasted this crapfest movie . " sphere longiness " ? ech ! i don't understand all you people who giving this movie 5 stars . i mean , what you thinking ? it just " i love 80 " nostalgia-factor kicking . i don't see any other rational reason this phenomenon . please . skating overgrown road ? skating dirt ? they'd get 10 feet before rock stuck their skates they went flying . it might fun watch if you make yourself believe rollerblades work sand . i'd say , other dystopian future skating flick , " prayer rollerboys " much better movie than this . course ain't saying much , because movie pretty much stinks too . buy something else . anything else . if not yourself , then least show black people world little basic human respect	-1

this achingly intense visually stunning movie one my favorites years . role tristan made pitt , aidan quinn stands out yet again wonderful , versatile , underrated actor he . julia ormond beautiful refined her role love interest all three brothers painfully convincing she descends into insanity . isabel two not given much speaking role , but i found her one my favorite characters actresses played her both child woman lovely . anthony hopkins ... well ... anthony hopkins . he perfect idealistic , knarly old patriarch his obvious favortism his middle son explains lot what motivates other two . earlier poster mentioned , timeline this movie little confusing , there few editing oversights ( brad hair kept changing same scene ) , but none it took away breathtaking cinematography some stellar acting . i thought voice-over indian chief very effective helped create ' atmosphere ' movie . soundtrack rich , haunting , agonizingly beautiful . music alone practically hypnotized me . legends fall brutal , beautiful , dark journey into madness leave you breathless emotionally exhausted end , but i found it definitely worth ride	-1

even though hollywood-driven glorification derrida superhero philosophy annoying -- if not furiating times , video , however , suceed unveiling fundamental character traits philosopher . namely , documentary revealed derrida reserved himself idiotic probing into his personal sex life which , needless say if granted , editors/director would exploit marketing stupified masses ( same masses who only buy-into dramatized or " controversial " ) . reason alone - derrida himself recognized this , counter it , distanced himself exploitative questions - it worth watching . since i not read any derrida work yet , i simply not say anything his philosophy . however , overly sensationalized/dramatized voice reading passages derrida philosophy offer some incredible insight into his thoughts .	1

i often heard people say all family could never produced today . i think this true , least , network television ( nbc , abc , cbs , fox ) . all family captures specific moment both television american history . carroll o'connor excellently renders american bigot , archie bunker , puts him up scrutiny before live audience . all family not entirely political correctness bigotry , but when you look back show , those social forces remain reasons why it couldn't produced today . six feet under , uncensored , would certainly no chance broadcast either . politically correct imperative contemporary american culture would sue complain it " wardrobe malfunction . " malfunction , however , emotional intellectual dishonesty most tv shows today , most mainstream culture today . i think almost all television cartoon . i like six feet under because it not not turn its homosexual characters into prancing man-boys grace . violence six feet under well earned integral drama comedy series . sex human relationships six feet under complicated weird , which completely normal . mostly , it refreshing watch show cares story character instead explosions , statutory sex objects , impossibly melodramatic events . if all family reflects political awakening , taught through comedy , then six feet under reflects response political correctness . bigotry all family responds monolithic misanthropic political correctness six feet under responding . bigotry political correctness merely two sides same dishonesty ; they rules codes human behavior expression not work out real life . archie bunker certainly not subtle guy , but his assumptions people different him wrong ( funny ) . now , when everything subtle politically correct eggshells , people no longer honest . that what six feet under me : we need relearn how trust others enough honest , i think six feet under accurately argues not all honesty mean , avoiding confrontation isn't always nice . end , hbo six feet under what networks used : respect intelligence , maturity , humanity audience	1

its not often nowadays we get chance see tour de france without complete focus exploits lance armstrong , rider extraordinaire , triathlete , marathoner , etc . etc . while i respect admire armstrong accomplishments much next fan , this movie isn't lance . likewise , its not phil paul their increasingly tiresome oln coverage . so what hell wheels all ? its german film ( yes , german but clearly visible english subtitles ) follows telekom boys during 2003 tour de france , epic battle fore-mentioned lance jan ullrich ( who incidentally rode bianchi year ) . lance jan appear frequently but not principal characters . tyler hamilton ( who rode entire race broken collarbone ) andreas kloden ( who rode few stages broken coxyx also figure side characters . primary characters rolf aldag , erik zabel ( roomates ) their masseuse/assistant eule , grizzled old guy who looks like he seen his share riders come go . race footage , we hear older gentleman who appears spent little too much time tour archives he narrates great black white footage very first years . although he little out there , he lends french flair film . exhilarating takes tdf stages , beginning end , we see riders recovering , musing day performance , suffering fallout daily crashes , mountain stages , etc . we often hear erik rolf talking over race eule works out kinks massage table . zabel particular some soul searching he just can't seem come up sprint win . aldag takes mountain jersey , but next day cracks , showing us just how fleeting victory tdf - how phenomenal winners really . prepared stunning footage mountain stages where we see just how tough these stages bikers . camera work magnificent - integrating fixed television-style feed hand-held shots give viewer perspectives we never get oln or any other tv coverage . my favorite scene alps when armstrong , ullrich , mayo flash arm length - showing how incredibly fast these riders go up mountain passes . while non cyclists may or may not enjoy drama tour , cyclists definitely groove racing footage . euro-pop sound track plenty solid bass sounds great dolby surround all class . i've watched video movie used it while trainer - either way its great buy ! gte it yourself or your favorite cyclist - they'll love it	1

i watched this documentary pbs i must say it one best ones i seen my whole life . it extremely disturbing too , because it sadly reminds us what human still capable . murder almost one million lives couple weeks shame whole mankind . international community nothing stop killings , un always deplorable soi-disant civilised world , i.e. usa , france , uk , belgium , germany et alii , not mind intervene political reasons , although time usa marines nearby burundi . clinton administration kofi annan(at time chief peace keeping operations ) absolutely nothing concrete but uttering stupid , useless rhetorical technical speeches . not mention shameful , coward stance belgian government panicked withdrew its troops citizens . real heroes bunch canadian african troops their very best protect remaining tutsis moderate hutus therefore deserve our biggest praises all their efforts . again , it one more appalling moment human history . it seems we never learn . among scenes shocked me forever sad images dead bodies drifted away rwandan river little girl , nowadays lady , found alive among dead bodies her family . this dvd provides wonderful opportunity think over sordid noxious nature european colonialism africa , after all , rwanda belgian colony belgian fomented apartheid tutsis hutus through , among other things , use id cards stating their ethnicity . it also shows dangers hands-off policies when intervention morally rightly justified required . this must-have dvd . please , let us not allow rwanda happen again ..	1
i could not help but watch this film all my african american female sensibilities . despite proficient acting , cinematography directing , i found content highly offensive trite . mr. kinksy claimed love shanduri willing anything possess her affections . he put off find out shanduri married , but not deterred . shanduri gave him what she believed unattainable challenge her husband , who arrested speaking out against government , freed african prison . i recognize it possible servant fall love her employer , however i know it extremely rare . ( ask any black woman who cleaned white person house , `how much love you your boss . ' relationship shanduri mr. kinksy one abuse power emotional manipulation . during `relationship ' i watched develop , not once shanduri refer her employer his first name . clearly indicating uneven balance power control ... not much different slave owner offering free his children born his african concubine . so , mr. kinksy gave up some his prized possessions ; it european influence created climate allowed shanduri husband detained indefinitely . though i am one among several different review film , i no reason forget long history abuse past present women color experienced hands white people , especially white men . see such film insult example how europeans not understand masses african americans	-1

some may think supernatural stories played out . we've plenty here states we're getting much more overseas . what i love each these movies they're not so repetitive . you get tired seeing same thing over over again , but these kind thrillers we always get something different . sure ghosts there but stories different way characters presented what makes each film stand alone . there some many movies i name which carry same overall topic but each those movies you see stores different each other one way or . you don't watch these movies scares even though it fun scared . you just sit down watch it story relationships characters . heirloom me one those movies . sure it movie unknown supernatural force but it films story draws you . heirloom isn't really scary i don't believe it made scary movie . what makes heirloom so great powerful plot twists you figure out you go . heirloom tells story man who inherits old family house . he checks place out he decides move bring his fianc ? . they stay house man slowly begins remember parts his childhood , bringing back old memories forgotten age . house dark history , which thirty years prior entire family attended bizarre rituals ended up committing suicide all same time . each relative hung rope die . while man unaware his family history he begins witness some strange happenings involving old house . friends appearing house out nowhere others killed off weird mysterious causes . it house itself or there something evil going ? we soon find out couple dig deeper into family history what really went thirty years ago . now this movie definitely worth watching . story great even though not all it original . but way it played out scene scene different when you figure out mystery behind everything it not pleasant all . heirloom features one most disturbing plot turns i've ever seen . it not graphic but idea everything so twisted wrong story just completely drives you . heirloom very dramatic horror film heart pounding mystery , likeable characters good story all around . plot dialog movie what really makes it good watch . it so long since i've bothered twist heirloom really good job letting story unfold dialog disturbing flashbacks . most movie we fallow couple who try find out mystery behind house all weird events taken place over last week . overall subject deals family curses , punishments characters who deal same fate . movie beautifully shot , using different views inside house give it more creepy feeling house itself large contains dark history . lot scenes blend together flash backs tell story give it more questionable approach what answer everything . like most mysterious you don't get know everything until near end . which also when we get see more these flashbacks , near end explains it all . overall look heirloom also really good . art design fantastic you really believe characters staying old house . nothing looks too fake or obvious . locations fine spice things up film also simple yet perfectly fitting score . music sets up mood each scene should enough draw your attention . heirloom well made good looking film which i really recommend watching . also sure check out bonus features understand more making it . if you want see movie scare living daylights out you , then look somewhere else . heirloom isn't kind movie watch scares , or blood guts matter . like many movies involving supernatural mysteries heirloom plot dialog driven film . using story characters set mood you guessing until end . but trust me when i say it not pleasant . there no happy endings or events this picture . story very dark unsettling times . watch heirloom mystery , not action or huge body count . if you sit down pay attention all way through then you rewarded . it good movie doesn't supply scares blood get viewers attention . there plenty drama mystery	-1
i understand every generation desire remake or reinterpret classic dramas , plays literature , this case , henry james psychological ghost story , " turn screw . " however , 21st century filmmakers should know now : modern newer not necessarily better . less more producers should realized when they considered this remake . outstanding remarkable 1961 adaptation " innocents " ghosts or apparitions most part seen briefly distance . music , sound effects , stunning cinematography made apparitions children precocious behavior even more chilling disconcerting . this drama doesn't work following reasons : ghosts revealed close-up , realistic lingering shots . they neither mysterious nor frightening . children unappealing not terribly convincing ; other words very badly cast . most surprisingly , very talented jodhi may who should perfect this role somehow simultaneously grim blank beginning ; she gives us little insight into her character . overall , this disappointing adaptatio	-1

" ronin " sets out telling viewer some samurai warriors who shamed when their lord killed , via treachery , lord . this made them " ronin " - or rogues . movie itself bore scant resemblance legend it quoted -- which only one its shortcomings . robert deniro phones performance , though jean reno creditable job his ally vincen t.t he film follows formation mysterious , multi-national gang criminals hired mysterious irish woman retrieve mysterious silver case . gang doesn't know what case , who they working or each other . there lots gunplay , plenty car chases , faintly interesting locales french riviera paris , lots collateral damage civilians . what seems propel movie lack clarity motives gang members purpose their activities . seemingly , this intended writers , who wanted show criminals ( or they ? ) furiously fighting dying cause they not understand , long lucrative reward awaited them . viewer , however , unfolding drama only reason keep watching this dud film . all its vaunted samurai connections , ronin disappointing . car chases dull seemed interminable . accidents caused thereby ludicrously overdramatic , lots flying sparks gasoline explosions . gunfights ridiculously one-sided . end film , silver case changed hands so many times movie started look like comedy routine .

this documentary uses interviews trace origins linux , process , it provides interesting insight into open source movement its philosophy . richard stallman , founder gnu project , featured prominently throughout film . ( gnu set applications provide unix-compatible framework . ) he explains how gnu developed through open source environment , environment where code taken , modified , shared , but it cannot made proprietary . he also explains development gnu general public license which prohibits developers making code proprietary . during gnu development , linus torvalde , developing kernel -- which just piece missing open source environment . ( kernel use allocate resources other applications . ) this kernel became linux . stallman said , it would take years get gnu linux work together smoothly , but eventually things would take off . although linux started 1991 10,000 lines code , it might remained hobbyist os , if it not apache web server . apache became ' killer app , ' business case buying linux . ( there interview shown brian behlendorf , president apache project . ) 1998 , linux 7.5 million users companies like red hat contributing its growth selling distribution suppor t.t his film also shows tug-of-war microsoft open source proponents . eric . raymond , author cathedral bazaar , describes some differences proprietary open source environments , he explains how his book one many influences netscape decision release their source code . you see interviews michael tieman ( co-founder cygnus technology ) larry augustin ( co-founder va linux ) . interview bruce perens , author open source definition , interesting . it used throughout film frame gnu linux development stories within open source context . also , perens lists ' rights ' open software , one senses open source philosophy one seriously thought out . overall , this interesting documentary . however , i'm giving it only 4 stars because i found segment end ( where torvalde augustin speaking ) very tedious . it didn't add content it seemed more like personal ' grand-standing . ' still , i'd recommend this film anyone who interested computer history or looking get better understanding what open source movement	-1

universal soldier one best action films jean claude van damme . film released 1993 . movie based awfully chilly idea secret government project use reanimated corpses dead soldiers universal soldiers . these soldiers really killer combat zombies programmed receive commands remotely . they extremely efficient killer machines impervious pain , quick heal , pretty much unstoppable although they tend overheat if they stay active too long . this movie , jean-claude van damme stars man who supposedly killed war vietnam . he revived secret biochemical , regenerative experiment cyborg controlled people who made him . project initially proceeds according plan . however , van damme starts recalling memories series flashes his past , he eventually remembers bloodthirsty , psychotic vindictive sergeant ( dolph lundgren ) , who also now turned into cyborg , evil core . fight them resumes where they left when they alive . action really gets hot when van damme regains his memory eventually leads his freedom controlled his creators . but creators not prepared let van damme go free without them doing everything they get him back under their control once again . both jean-claude van damme dolph lundgren play their respective roles exceptionally well . pretty sexy alley walker , who plays reporter who joins van damme his fight against universal soldier , also gives good performance . those who love action movies thrilled fierce fist fights , unforgettable stunts kickboxing action compel you watch it again again . i recommend anybody who likes van damme movies or good action movies get " universal soldier .

first , i don't think edward norton made bad film . he definitely doesn't disappoint here either . very clever role paul giamatti well . this movie prestige wanted . all its big name actors , i think it overshadowed illusionist just bit . prestige leaves us stunned thinking magicians possess supernatural powers , but that not what we want believe . we're satisfied because magicians gave away few secrets , but not ones we wanted them . illusionist tricks us much same way , but doesn't create hype going above beyond realm real magic . we still stunned , but we still told it only trick . we believe it . beautiful cinema . superb acting . excellent music score . excellently paced well . i wasn't bored . prestige , i felt like they could trimmed it little without taking away film , but it still distracting . illusionist grabs your full attention doesn't let go . we get good show , enough it leaves you wanting more . just magic show should ! good illusion	1
it fantastic movie when it first released it still just good . great photography , good narrative . makes me long summer days i used spend beach santa cruz	1

since today 9-11 , before i begin my review , i would like take this opportunity express my condolences families their loved-ones who lost their lives fateful horrific day 9-11 . time heals but you never forget . ( i know i won't i wasn't even there . ) j.l. i doing review classic " jimi plays monterey/shake ! otis monterey " originally released 1967 two rock ' roll greatest legends , late great jimi hendrix ( born 26 november 1942 , died 18 september 1970 ) jimi hendrix experience late great otis redding . ( born 9 september 1941 , died 10 december 1967 ) i also editing this review time time so you consumer get best most accurate review possible . first , jimi hendrix . what i say this legendary guitarist hasn't already said ? my opinion , johnny allen hendrix ( original name before his father al hendrix changed it james marshall hendrix . ) forever go down history greatest guitarist rock ' roll ever produced . maybe i should add more statement . jimi hendrix forever go down music history greatest guitarist ever picked up instrument . please remember hard it seems believe , guitarist myself , jimi hendrix " self taught " guitarist . nobody taught jimi play way he . then it dawned me , nobody this world could ever taught jimi how play guitar way he . jimi hendrix born god-given gift naturally pick up instrument just teach himself how play guitar , simple . jimi hendrix so far ahead his time it took years before his well-respected contemporaries would catch up him . jimi hendrix complete guitarist , playing both rhythm lead guitars consistently well while handling singing duties . most bands nowadays separate lead singer , rhythm guitarist lead guitarist . there many great guitarists passed through rock ' roll history ; legendary guitarists such chuck berry , late great eddie cochran , late great buddy holly , late great ritchie valens , peter green , eric clapton , jeff beck , jimmy page , santana , robin trower , keith richards , dave davies , peter frampton , pete townshend , ritchie blackmore , late great stevie ray vaughn , joe perry , angus young , late great terry kath , late great randy rhodes , joe satriani frank marino . i'm sure there many other legendary guitar greats i failed mention i apologize . but jimi hendrix guitarist ( man ) re-wrote rules how guitar would played . hendrix also rewrote rules how guitar would presented out front lead reckoned instrument . hendrix would become extremely well known playing guitar his teeth , behind his head , behind his back his legs . what guitarist doing this prior hendrix ? hendrix even popularized instrument even more than his past predecessors . i mean no disrespect any way past guitar greats , especially blues greats . i don't believe any legendary guitar greats whether they played blues , country or rock ever deny accomplishments jimi hendrix such short time . ( two half years ) most guitarists almost take their whole career accomplish what jimi just two half years . many rock critics well certain friends believe jimi , like blues great robert johnson mighty led zeppelin , sold his soul devil exchange greatest guitarist ever lived . this statement true or it myth ? i leave up you decide . enough , lets get review . " jimi plays monterey " quite simply , " rock history making ! " this concert also marks jimi first u.s. appearance . ( jimi , native american , two british musicians named noel redding bass mitch mitchell drums , became star england before he became star his own country . ) this performance single-handedly gave birth ultimate performance lifetime jimi hendrix experience . all legendary rumors backstage talk took place jimi hendrix pete townshend who which band wasn't going follow other , i highly recommend 1992 released book simply entitled , " monterey pop , " written joel selvin great photos veteran rock photographer jim marshall . selvin researched backstage moments hendrix townshend finally answers questions quoted page 92 , third paragraph : backstage , pete townshend who angrily confronted jimi hendrix . townshend accused hendrix stealing his act ( hendrix admitted he but made it better ) , two continued arguing back forth who would follow who . townshend still smarting experience followed hendrix earlier year london saville theatre . legend it , front legendary contemporary spectators such eric clapton , brian jones janis joplin , late john phillips mama papa get separate two artists resolve matter flip coin . who won toss who went first . jimi hendrix quoted saying after coin toss , " if i follow who , then i'm going pull all stops . " eric burden animals quoted saying during introduction who : " i promise you this group who calls themselves who destroy you more ways than one . " who took stage bad intentions performed blistering set which resulted total destruction their instruments end . who crazily leaving stage , pete townshend quoted telling jimi , " follow ! " according book " monterey pop " page 94 , second paragraph : real mopping up chores left up grateful dead , thrust who hendrix , barely enough time get warmed up . when hendrix company took stage sunday evening ( june 18 , 1967 ) , he easily literally proceeded blowing every band ( including who ) off stage . hendrix performed nine songs night follows : ( 1 . ) " killing floor " ( howlin ' wolf classic performed excellent ! hendrix arrived ! ) , ( 2 . ) " foxey lady " ( awesome ! ) , ( 3 . ) " like rolling stone " ( hendrix great tribute bob dylan ) , ( 4 . ) " rock me baby " ( b.b. king classic , this song truly rocks ! ) , ( 5 . ) " hey joe " ( excellent ! ) , ( 6 . ) " you see me " ( excellent rocker ! ) , ( 7 . ) " wind cries mary " ( beautifully crafted poetic , well written well performed . ) , ( 8 . ) " purple haze " ( excellent ! this song leave you " haze " " daze . " ) ( 9 . ) " wild thing . " ( troggs classic song performed jimi hendrix way . american british anthems . quite simply , one rock finest moments during one rock finest hours history ! you see dvd believe it . ) hendrix performance new dawn day rock ' roll history . rock ' roll finally grown up matured no longer diapers . rock ' roll finally artistic something say . it probably best gods ( i'll always love never say anything bad my heroes beatles , rolling stones beach boys ) not appear monterey because there new gods ( jimi hendrix experience , otis redding , who , janis joplin steve miller ) born . i hendrix fanatic since i eight years old 60 i practically own just every vinyl , cassette , vhs cassette , cd dvd hendrix . i also own just every hendrix bootleg that ever come out . i always highly recommend this concert part any teenager musical education especially since it part american history . i don't think i continue telling you how great this concert really . enough said , now its otis redding turn . i apologize not leaving very much this review otis redding . ( no disrespect otis or otis redding estate . ) all i say otis redding his performance monterey simply " magical ! " according book " monterey pop " pages 79-81 , redding performance excellent ! otis performed his trademark songs such " i've loving you too long " ( great song early rolling stones ike tina turner favorite . ) , " respect " ( hit song queen soul aretha franklin ) , " try little tenderness " ( breathtaking ! ) rolling stones hit single " satisfaction . " ( otis redding way , excellent ! ) only bad part otis redding legend according book " monterey pop " page 81 end paragraph one : redding would not live long enough savor fruits or fame his successful performance monterey very long . six months later , twenty-six-year-old soul giant would die plane crash icy waters wisconsin lake . few short years later , jimi would follow . what major loss rock ' roll soul music history . over all , this dvd set excellent worth every penny . closing , this dvd set not just important part our lives , but important moment part american history . thanks reading my long review i hope you enjoyed reading it much i enjoyed writing it all you . i also hope you read all my other reviews when time permits . long live rock ' roll ! rock out always . take care , j.l.	1

i've sat through more than my fair share pretentious films my attempt escape hollywood drivel . based cast strength film maker , i thought holy smoke would good script , strong performances something say . indeed , film began much promise , only bogged down what i would call awful second dreadful third act . how characters get point point beyond me certainly not motivated what shown screen . if this movie designed question roles men women religious circles , question physical vs . mental domination relationships , or question choices vs . others ' perceptions those choices , it would worthwhile use kodak film . end , film suffers too many ideas , too little cohesion too much self-importance . i would suggest avoiding this film , almost much i would avoid gigli .	-1

" well , i've seen film four times now my respect grows each viewing . i certainly see why some don't like it or don't ' get ' it : " generations " some ( apparent ) plot holes some things aren't spelled-out or explained very well ( so what ? doesn't mystery intrinsically come territory space adventure ? ) ; plus story just plain convuluted . regardless , i feel " generations " ambitious , high-concept sci-fi highest order ; it leaves viewer many interestng questions ponder long afterwards . although nexus beeen criticized mere gimmick get kirk picard together , i find concept utterly fascinating : no matter how much we want it , illusory paradise just -- illusion . far i'm concerned , concept nexus its implementation into storyline nothing short brilliant . besides this , there incredible number highlights : usual trek humor , data amusing experiences emotion chip , malcolm mcdowell outstanding performance mad soran , soran believable obsession justifications , b'etor lursa their " wild bunch " klingons , startling obliteration them their vessel , thrilling crash-landing enterprise-d , meeting kirk picard nexus , final showdown soran kirk death ( disregarding lame " oh my " ) . needless say , " generations " far more than offer mere juvenile space battles . biggest plot hole ( or maybe not ): picard purpose leaving nexus stop soran annihilating enerprise-d crew entire veridian solar system , including 230 million people live veridian iv . since picard leave nexus " go anywhere any time , " guinan pointed out earlier , why go veridian iii minute before soran launches his rocket ? why not go back when soran guest enterprise-d apprehend him then there ? writer ronald . moore defended picard decision grounds he didn't want risk dangerous unexpected consequences occur when tampering timeline ; hence , his journey back time nexus only matter minute or so . hmmm , it good explanation i accept it . second biggest plot hole : if soran rocket-probe powerful enough effect quantum implosion veridian star , would it not cause quite bit more damage veridian iii when it explodes ? surely both picard ( who merely hides behind rock outcropping ) kirk would utterly obliterated entire immediate surroundings planet ? explanation : some criticized fact guinan simultaneously present real world nexus . how could this ? it simple : it repeatedly established reality experienced nexus not real ; one experiences what they desire nexus , not what real . instance , picard no children real world , but because he desired them he able experience them nexus . hence , ' guinan ' portrayed nexus may walk , talk act precisely like guinan , but she not real . she only there because picard desires her there purpose explaining nature nexus . capeesh ? commentary nexus : although nexus should simply taken face value strange space phenomenon , one also regard it analogy . first glance one might get impression nexus type heaven , but this can't so since it repeatedly emphasized film people events experiened nexus not real . ' heaven , ' term theologians ministers traditionally use refer eternal abode redeemed ( technically referred " new heavens new earth " bible ~ 2 peter 3:13 ) , -- contrast -- always depicted real bible , not illusory paradise . if nexus not analgous heaven , what could it type ? nexus corresponds any addiction person " tastes " embraces escape reality ( e.g. drugs , alcohol , computer games , tv , porn , fishing , shopping , golf , etc . ) some , like soran , unable flee its clutches waste their lives talents obsessed it . others , like picard kirk , able see truth escape ; they therefore " make difference " real life . bottom line : this " passing-of-the-torch " installment requires attention span appreciation high-concept sci-fi ; it bore tears those whom star trek only means neato spacecrafts superficial space dogfights ( don't get me wrong , they each their place star trek ) . " generations " courage make bold changes -- killing off major iconic character , fairly prominent support characters well , not mention destroying enterprise-d . " generations " science-fiction grown-ups youth advanced cerebral development . all others should stick star wars " zathura " ( giggle ) .	1

hornblower fan many decades , i am very disappointed this movie . ioan gruffud portrays hornblower who almost modern high school delinquent - kind who walks front your car when you drive near public hs show he " cool " or " big man " . whereas this may appeal someone who sports " question authority " sticker , it not hornblower i know . overall , it seems movies not too well one greatest heroes fiction - but least gregory peck hornblower decent - this one not quite material which commodore hornblower made ... kind person portrayed gruffud , above all , childish ( we all know , " cool " same " cute " ) . perhaps other ones this ioan gruffud better , but these two bad enough they keep me buying others	-1

legend rita generally excellent film . rita vogt belongs small faction terrorists who rob banks commit other crimes " support revolution " 1970s west germany . get-go , movie fast-paced exciting , robberies fights among terrorists highlighted quick scene changes . rita , fleeing west german police , ultimately takes refuge east germany then given " legends , " i.e. , identities , disguise her presence country . although character completely fictional , rita appears resemble , both physically otherwise , red army faction member susanne albrecht , who given asylum new identity east germany ( although albrecht not participate jailbreak . ) rita idolizes east germany pleased live " true socialist state " - position becomes untenable after wall falls 1989 . film strikes note truth it contrasts east germany seen through rita rose-colored glasses country it seen its own citizens . rita faith , enthusiasm , socialism blinds her dreariness east german life , which drives other characters film drink . said , this portrayal raf ( although group not named ) terrorist far too sanitized . liner notes , director refers real raf " so-called " terrorists . film , we shown apparently accidental murder attorney mid-jailbreak , murder policeman who trying catch rita . both these murders rationalized ( those who wish rationalize them ) crazed attempts prevent arrest or continued imprisonment . reality , raf deliberately , malice aforethought , murdered innocent people . susanne albrecht , example , deliberately lured jurgen ponto , chairman dresdner bank albrecht godfather , his death . raf faction killed heinz hillegart , german economic attache sweden , hung his corpse out window . they kidnapped peter lorenz , christian democrat candidate mayor west berlin . raf joined other terrorists hijacking air france jetliner entebbe . they separated jews all other passengers threatened kill them -- would , israeli force led jonathan netanyahu not rescued hostages . short , this bad , bad , bad gang , - if indeed schlondorff portraying raf - it no good sugar-coat them . while film shows stasi helping terrorists -- which indeed happen -- it shows stasi men far too genial my taste . stasi portrayed simply enthusiasts , who romanticize revolutionary spirit terrorists try live vicariously through their exploits . fact , demonstrated elsewhere , relationship stasi various terrorist groups symbiotic : it part east german policy , determined highest level politburo encouragement soviet union , arm train them . despite these flaws , i highly recommend film . it provides very realistic portrayal east germany , right down prefabricated houses workplace collections worldwide revolutionary movements . spy agency " comrade general " shown hunting , which favorite activity stasi commander erich mielke . moreover , bibliana beglau terrific actress , her portrayal rita convincing . we never completely sure why rita joined gang -- it really love , or her obvious sympathies lead her over edge ? finally , film raises some important issues youthful mistakes perspective middle age . overall , film well worth watching .	-1

there not much more added what already written or said russia love . it considered one better bond films series . before i get main point what i add , i want comment widescreen versions issued . i am not sure what proper aspect ratio this film . comparison dvd laser disc , dvd appears cropped top bottom give it wider effect . proportions prints i saw several theaters all resembled laser disc . my more important note curiosity however content film itself . i still not seen any version vhs , laser or dvd ones i seen theater russia love . it appears video two scenes contain cuts . cut # 1 : when red grant bond his knees gunpoint aboard orient express , he editorializes most graphic manner roll film shot bond tatiana boudoir . its time , this rather risqu� piece dialogue . today standards it somewhat timid . bond comeback still intact video , responding grant how it took collection pretty sick minds dream up such scheme . direct response grant cut line gives us insight into bond moral standards there line even he would not cross given his flare more amorous pursuits . cut # 2 : this cut line more obvious comes end film when bond tatiana floating down canals venice . bond holds up reel film seized grant . again , bond makes direct reference grant cut line train droll throwaway remark puzzled looking tatiana . you actually see this cut because music jumps . once more , this cut line dialogue gives us glimpse into james bond mystique it still formed honed screen . i am sure bond probably saying himself , " take all dirty pictures you want . i'm one girl grant , " old boy , " you're one six feet under . " film itself , it one classic james bond films remain so all time . tone series would altered slightly what director terence young established dr . no this film . next film , goldfinger directed guy hamilton , would retain style established terence young yet he would refine character james bond more tongue-in-cheek approach . russia love james bond dedicated civil servant licence kill he uses it assassination krilencu ( fred haggerty ) just coldly objectively he eliminated professor dent ( anthony dawson ) dr . no . these reasons i believe there two distinct camps ranks bond loyalists . one prefers style or more specifically portrayal james bond found russia love , while other faction favors established goldfinger . james bond found russia love much tougher fellow not seen again until her majesty secret service licence kill . specific point russia love score composed john barry . barry score this film not complex or melodically constructed his subsequent bond scores . yet , barry score old school sean connery approach role exactly way it should . barry no-frills score compliments connery no nonsense bond . essence russia love product its time very good one .	1

okay , let brief : if you didn't grow up horror lovin ' 80 or not established fan italian horror films , this movie probably won't work you . this unofficial sequel romero " dawn dead " ( 1978 version course ) made primary italian audiences when dawn released there under title " zombi " . even though this one doesn't take place mall or feature anything or anyone like original storyline dawn , it almost same feel . eventually america , this film came us english dubbed audio under title " zombie " . but now shriek show finally released remastered 2 disc set this classic movie fully uncut first time states . or so i thought . ya see , when movie starts , there brief scene set-up ( it always ) , then it goes into opening credits . i expecting see original italian credits showing it finally under it original title " zombi 2 " , like box . but it isn't , it american version title " zombie " . nitpicking , huh ? but after little searching i found easter egg shows original title sequence finally shows this film called " zombi 2 " . here how get it ( it easy .... ) : disc one go " features " section . there , press number " 6 " your remote . it activate red skull button upper right screen ( you can't activate it searching around menu your arrow buttons , very rare easter egg standards ! ) , it press button automatically take you original italian opening credits clearly show this film called " zombi 2 " , logo all . also , after they're , it show alternate end credits , but honestly i couldn't see any difference them opposed ones movie now . all all , this movie never looked or sounded better ever . some say it looks too cleaned up now . they might point because picture so perfect now ( colors bright , sharp image , brightness exact , sound crisp , etc ) it gives away effects movie . well , i'd rather this movie perfect picture than dark , grainy vhs anyday . this movie classic piece horror history should owned ( especially shriek show 25th anniversary version ... extras here superior .... making documentary long movie itself ! ) anyone two or more " living dead/zombie " dvd already their collection . i'm glad i got it , this way classic horror should re-release d.p.s. : if you look hard enough ( dvd trailer section their previews ) , there " zombi 3 " " zombie 4 " movies out there too . trust me , you don't need them or want them , they don't same feel or quality " zombi 2 " or " dawn dead " . just happy their trailers . enjoy	1

i bought this dvd because it cheap , i figured i could not go wrong old hitchcock classic . first two minutes film gave me some doubts , sound quality opening music poor ( i thought sound fine after picture quality very good ) . then story got going , i amazed . this film really needs appreciated two levels . first , it wonderfully pleasant thriller . it script days when they cared writing good dialogue . it quite witty , pleasantly sexy , latter family-friendly way nonetheless more engaging than so much modern , explicit material . but second level what makes this film so astonishing . it made 1938 england . time , appeasement official policy british government most british press . fact , film censorship board would not even allow words " german " or " nazi " used connection bad guys . film nonetheless manages suggest utter evil nazism show utter bankruptcy appeasement . what most intriguing , film cleverly shows variety people who just don't want get involved any nastiness , one reason or , but who true british hearts gold come through wonderfully once fight proves unavoidable . my pleasure this wonderful film mixed few counts . first , course , sadness film proved so amazingly prophetic tragedy years followed . second this film so little known , when it should rights part history curriculum every student learns high school . third this film just meaningful us today it when it made . alas , it just may we living 1938 all over again .	1

heinrich harrer auto-biography his war time adventures seven years tibet adapted screen france auteur director jean-jacques annaud ( name rose , amant , ' , enemy gates ) sensitivity grand cinematography ( robert fraisse ); this film more meandering journal harrar experiences , rather than your standard structured plot , focusing certain events transformed man lonely , terribly angry individual into aware feeling spirit , mainly due intimate relationship young dali lama . brad pitt portrayed harrer adept skill combining intensity natural cadence , his austrian accent sounded authentic , his blonde hair striking blue eyes expressing anger , loneliness film end , echoes calmness self awareness . heinrich harrer , austrian nazi , olympic gold medallist , used nazi propaganda machine climb near impossible , mt . nanga parbat himalayas , challenge most german climbers time attempted reach her summit but never succeeded . because snow slides , bad weather injuries , harrer team forced turn back , only find england declared war germany ( 1939 ) , taken prisoner english army , living next three years indian pow camp . this enjoyable segment film because harrer unbending spirit stubbornness escape prison . although mean-spirited individual during this time , these scenes depict harrer focused hard nails character . david thewlis peter aufschnaiter ( omen , kingdom heaven ) subtle actor , actor who more than likely not win any lead roles , however his talent skill actor should carry many leading men . peter , his german accent , subtle , his demeanour strong yet sensitive . he played against pitt character touch humility , all great actors , made lead look great . this not say , course , pitt bad any way , it just acting great actor always make you look good . thewlis one such actor . true stars film eight fourteen year old dali lama(s ) , jamyang jamtsho wangchuk sonam wangchuk . both young brothers beamed laughing curiosity temporal wisdom which we come recognize dali lama . my favourite scene jamyang ( fourteen year old ) coming through curtains his new glasses , asking heinrich if he looked like egghead ... very real , very innocen t.t he sadness anger inducing message seven years tibet slaughter millions tibetan buddhist monks destruction over 600 sacred monasteries invading chinese . tragedy politics ignorance dali lama present time made his life mission change , his homeland , tibet , achieve independence communist china . powers world nothing . why ? seven years tibet not fast-paced film , but one look absorb , savour its beautiful photography ponder many messages it communicates . this truly beautiful film .	-1

i am thrilled beyond words filmation blackstar flash gordon both finally released complete series sets dvd ! their time , both shows very well-done terms plot , animation , music , visual effects . ironically , considering most american produced anime recently become low-tech cgi cubist [ ... ] these two vintage entries welcome naturalist relief . considering they both basically early american anime -- pre-robotech / pre-voltron -- i am completely flabbergasted either show even actually made it dvd but i guess we thank he-man , transformers , g.i. joe , thundercats starting retro-wave	1

writer paul monette refers this film one ' trilogy ' bad girl roles elizabeth taylor -- other two " cat hot tin roof " ( 1958 ) " suddenly , last summer " ( 1959 ) . these three films should every dvd collection . certainly they present taylor her absolute physical peak , but they also show dark side her sexuality , which quite riveting . taylor loves refer this movie " trash " , even though she won oscar role . maybe she felt she exploited studio this film content due her highly publicized love affairs time . however , sex sells , beautiful , voluptuous , amoral model , taylor never better . she simply smoulders this film , especially ' morning after ' scenes beginning . she laurence harvey make very hot team , scorching , something we've never seen taylor richard burton . movie really star vechicle , it all taylor her leading man , some excellent supporting players . taylor some good acting , very moving confession scene her last scene harvey she tries escape him . also interesting fact this may first film link child molestation promiscuity , or even talk such subjects . remember this made 1960	-1

i seen bits pieces woody allen " zelig " before but i never seen whole movie until last night . honest , my initial reaction wonder if i would able maintain interest throughout whole movie . it turned out , no problem . " zelig " tells story individual who developed unexplainable ability appear like people his surroundings . it presented documentary format format amazingly well . i'm opinion there plenty actual newsreel footage 1920 ' 30 there also plenty new film made appear it era . i never certain which which because cinematography well . retrospective interviews present day theorists aged contemporaries butressed documentary nature film ( continuous narration ) . title character ( played woody allen ) assumes more more identities , we come understand his efforts like others leaves him no identity his own . i understood allen message expression his frustration negative public reaction his post- " annie hall " movies . he wasn't making kinds pictures everyone else his uniqueness dismissed . i saw him making statement banality lacks meaning satirizing someone who went out his way avoid himself . maybe allen higher purpose making " zelig " but i comfortable message i got out it .	-1
this movie represents all minorities , considering africans most exploited tortured american history . this movie putting racism other foot , where world black world view ran black ppl . john travolta excellent job portraying oppressed man son , who looking break system biasness discrimination . harry belafonte plays obnoxious bigot who doesnt see his ignorance ..................... this movie represents how prejudice american system how politics play strong role determining nots . my opinion majority americans would prosper whatever if given opportunity , so its not just lack self motivation but political dupery played ppl time time again . especially minorities all colors ..................... nuff said !	1

" arabian nights " tells timeless tale scheherazade imaginary stories which she enthralled her husband , sultan schahriar , order save her life , over span " thousand one arabian nights . " this lavish visually stunning production brims fantastic images , fabulous sets costumes , compelling characterizations , interesting stories exotic locations . updated version five classic 2,500 -year-old fantasies popularized 1800s sir richard burton , it features such memorable figures aladdin , ali baba genie lamp . it sure captivate viewers young old . i found it especially enjoyable because it filmed entirely location morocco turkey . vacationed both these countries , i recognized some locations , such leather tanneries fez , morocco , other-worldly rock formations cappadocia near goreme , turkey . sets buildings overflow exquisite detailing common islamic architecture . it treat eye take all rich , delicate decorations each scene realize , many cases , these real places , not simply movie sets . you easily view main feature , running just less than three hours , single sitting . but more likely you'll split it up over several days , 40 convenient chapter stops nicely divide it up into bite-sized segments . special features include fairly typical 13-minute " making " documentary , cast crew biographies production notes . there just few areas i found less than fully satisfying " arabian nights , " but none them detracted my enjoyment story . first , sound volume clarity tended fluctuate , sometimes it hard understand dialogue ( this common problem many dvds ) . second , computer graphics , while quite good overall , not up latest standards set likes " lord rings " " king kong . " instance , " dragons " guarding cave full treasures discovered ali baba not particularly well-rendered , digital " smoke " appears many scenes too obviously cgi . finally , there few deliberate " modernisms " speech or actions , or subtle pop-culture references modern times . first this little jarring , but i soon accepted it spirit which it probably intended . think " xena : warrior princess " you'll understand what i mean . this great dvd whole family enjoy . i heartily recommend " arabian nights " anyone interested spending few pleasant hours magical world sibling rivalry , palace intrigue , genies flying carpets	-1

ok ......... right off bat , we normally love psychological thrillers make you think opposed mindless " 6 kids woods getting slashed " type garbage . however sublime fails many levels .... 1 ) you know what story going 15 minutes into film , so there no element surprise end develops . 2 ) spoiler alert .......................................................................................................... " dream " / " hallucination " ( trying not spoil too bad ) scenes lose all creepiness because they simply silly stupid opposed frightening . 3 ) all characters so odd , you really never care george , his wife , his kids or anybody matter . all all it came across movie trying very " artsy-fartsy " trying create mystery editing together random erratic hallucinatory sequences simply sake confusing opposed intriguing storytelling . we suckered fact one producers tv show " 24 " involved this project . but not help this film all .	-1

this traditional telling life jesus , before his birth resurrection . cinematography breathtaking , color , costuming , writing aided carl sandberg flawless inspired scene jesus weeping then raising lazarus dead awe inspiring . it this scene which motivated me write this review . rather than showing us thunderous awakening dead within tomb , stevens jesus lift hem his toga make difficult climb up rocky bluff , puffing all way tomb top hill . once there , jesus strikes pose made popular style ivan mestrovic french bronze sculptors mid twentieth century . when jesus reaches high tomb , stevens sandberg compose masterpiece prayer god life before jesus calls out , " lazarus ! come forth ! " but striking juxtaposition , stevens pulls back camera , hundreds feet tomb showing jesus , son almighty , mere speck against infinity countryside , let alone universe , much fist fight charlton heston gregory peck big country , shows scale man god work . however , jesus calls-out lazarus instead seeing him rise , we see wonderment , bewilderment , fear love men prospect one man raising abyss . we see crowd , camera dollies , rolls scans , faces believers , unbelievers , doubters ever faithful , their reactions man dead three days , reawakened act god , brought forth human , favored god . how much more effective this direction ? rather than straw man seeing dead rise , we see instead how people like us would react such thing , awe , tears joy , fear , love , attempts reconcile reality , unbelievable . there no better way show spectacle scene alone must-see aspiring artist or film director . my only complaint film nitpicky one , jesus ' ( max von sydow ) hair too short . if you believe , clap your hands , even if you don't , its worth 199 minutes your time . i saw film friends when it came out 1965 own vhs dvd , watched it group , one which self-proclaimed atheist-he tears his eyes lazarus scene . 4.75 star	1
it tough call me first third seasons . i found first season memorable because it many classic gags , i enjoyed relative simplicity stories , they seemed more focus " prehistoric " aspects . i've always loved episode " flintstone flyer " , i even remember building model flyer scratch when i kid . although they've always denied connection honeymooners , least few stories seem like rehashed honeymooners episodes . third season more involved plots , running theme " wilma baby ! nope , not yet ... " lot more parody . would probably more appeal today adults , though i find many stories too bizarre believable . ( i sorta buy idea human-powered helicopter made out wood , it fits cartoon physics ... but third-season " foxy grandma " episode involving old woman bank-robber who throws dynamite sticks just too much . ) second season wasn't strong , many plots seemed like repeats first season it lost much prehistoric charm . while i'll buy complete fourth season just round out collection , those shows typically my least favorite far . they went much too far bizarre stories ; i never liked great gazoo or uber-strong bamm-bamm , there way too much emphasis kids doing totally unbelievable things . what ultimately killed original flintstones series lack consistency writing portrayal characters , few or no running threads throughout show , tendency cartoons back then ( even many ordinary shows ) become increasingly outlandish over time . they seemed lost their original focus cartoon adults , especially last season -- though granted it fairly novel idea " real " human characters doing human things cartoon , so i'll cut them some slack . quality dvds this set much same others , although i notice two or three episodes noticeable ( but not horrible ) video noise , couple episodes lower-than-normal audio levels ( just crank up volume bit those ) . probably just means they couldn't find original sources some them resort other means ... i haven't checked out extras , though this set they used both sides last disc hold episodes instead using flip side extras . here my take : if you're not familiar flintstones then start first season , it most firmly grounded four seasons . if you really like it , check out some others . third-season episodes some best , but there few stinkers	1

i'm very surprised negative reviews . while this dvd clearly not made walt disney studios , it what it supposed - introduce french words phrases children easy-to-follow way . actors speak authentic french . what taught quite useful - introductions , counting , colors , playing , food , etc . actors use these words phrases within simple storyline they again repeated during review section . they also repeated once more songs scattered throughout dvd ( songs pretty catchy way - more so than other children videos ) . so , if you looking pure entertainment , this video probably not you but if you want tool hold your child attention teach them french , then you should give this try .	1

i love disaster movies , or any disaster movie involves water - titanic , hard rain , titanic , pearl harbour , titanic ... yeah i love titanic . but i shocked when watching this film how much titanic resembles it ! there lot where you see where james cameron might got some his ideas . i felt very claustrophobic watching this film , not only we watching it darkness , but there also fireworks going off outside , film itself very claustrophobic . there no natural light , boat capsized . i awful time recognising actors this , particularly gene hackman . i knew name , i could not pick out which one he . ( very blonde moment there . ) i eventually recognised him , cos he main character ( big clue there ) , he also using simon cowell fashion sense - high waisted trousers , polo neck tucked . i don't know why it took me so long recognise him , but i managed recognise ernest borgnine , who played rogo , little house prairie , one or two episodes . poseidon adventure really good film , no need special effects or cgi , apart odd one or two . nearly all stunts performed actors themselves , when possible , they would ended up many bumps . what made this film all more better lack special effects , it made it all more real . i holding my breath during many scenes - which quite difficult considering i blocked up cold time - because it so claustrophobic , it made it all more worse . poseidon adventure definitely up there one my favourite disaster movies now , i really look forward seeing sequel , ' remake ' . i just discovered looking imdb , red buttons ( what strange name ) also little house prairie , two episodes	-1

these two movies disney classics , especially first one , " escape witch mountain " - i saw this movie back when i kid it one my favorite movies ( still ) . it follows story two orphans named tia tony who extraordinary powers . not knowing where they came , they set out following map only belonging they ever owned- tia starcase . way there several men after them , one which ruthless man out use them their powers his twisted advantage . second movie , " return witch mountain " weaker than first , but still worth watch . tia tony much older this one , but much more comfortable their own skin because they know who they where they came . tony kidnapped brainwashed/controlled ruthless scientist who commands him use his power while tia gets help local street gang full delinquents save him . movies loosely based novel alexander key which also titled " escape witch mountain . " i recently found out he also wrote " return witch mountain " but i haven't chance read it ye t.t he first novel worth read but very different movies . example , tia mute not speak . she communicates tony telepathically . they also older book than they movie . orphanage they go beginning movie more so juvenile delinquents book filled bullies pretty mean caretaker . if you liked these movies , i recommend checking ebay books!i'd give " escape witch mountain " 5 stars " return witch mountain " 4 . they both classics	1
out three john waters films i've seen ( pink flamingos , serial mom , this film ... order ) , this definitely my favorite . it probably waters most normal film ( even this film some weird moments ); it got great cast , dialogue funny , some events play like some weird farce real life . edward furlong ( terminator 2 ) plays pecker , young kid who snaps pictures everything around him . graffiti'd walls , fat women , girls bus , man getting his hat stolen , pubic hair ... you name it , he takes picture it . eventually pecker photos get noticed rorey ( lili taylor , ' i shot andy warhol ' ) who puts his photos gallery mass acclaim . eventually , it takes toll pecker life everything spirals out control ... typical john waters fashion . movie plot pretty simple , but it hilarious . example ; pecker sister crissy sugar crazed brat . child protective services worker shows up house prescribes rittalin , which instantly changes her behavior . way i'm explaining it doesn't sound very funny all , but if you've any experience adhd ... then you'll get laugh out . christina ricci co-stars shelley , pecker girlfriend who runs fascist laundromat . i've always liked ricci actress , but her looks kind come go films . she'll look great one film then like crap . movie " ice storm " which came out around same time this , she didn't look great . here , she looks awesome . really hot she adds some fresh bits sarcasm film well . am i only one who thinks waters could've splurged nude scene here . anyway , all waters films , this movie not enjoyed everybody . however , this film different style then other two films i've mentioned ... so even if you no idea who waters , this movie isn't something you run tell your friends ( pink flamingos anybody ? ) . it damn funny , entertaining , witty . grade : a-	1

i first saw this movie high school french class back 70s . can't say i remembered much it except famous song image ( though not contents ) final gas station scene . course , our french teacher probably didn't let us see subtitles , so i'm guessing i really didn't understand most it anyway . got it lark recently watch again found it very touching , beautifully filmed , if tad melodramatic . coincidence , i watched " young girls rochefort " while back , made same director also starring deneuve . actually , i think i preferred " rochefort , " but both worth watching . simple story told straight-forward way , fact masked all dialogue sung . ending not what you expect , really , both characters appearing colder harder than typical romance might them . still , movie better because this , more moving realistic . each scene lovingly gorgeously put together , so its feast eyes . ears --- not so much . i found women voices harsh times , hitting high piercing notes grated . still , score pleasant -- though it may overused bi t--t he famous song joy hear	-1

i say all ggw videos i own ( 45-50 ) , this most disappointing since snoop dogg garbage couple years ago . only reason i give it two stars girls this one some prettiest so far . downsides numerous ; " hosts " take up far too much space this disk . let face it , we don't buy these dvds because we want hear unfunny guys interviewing drunk college kids . example : " hey , you fun spring break ? " well , she ninteen , drunk , beach mexico without parental supervision . i don't think it possible she couldn't good time . i don't need some guy asking banal questions airhead her boyfriend five minutes , when all i really bought dvd see her boobies ! ( btw-we never get see them ) . my second complaint whole dvd seems edited cable . title " spring break 2005 uncensored , " but this absolutely not true . i said before , girls this video stunningly beautiful . hats off crew rounding up truly fine selection gorgeous , uninhibited talent . but scenes shot hotel rooms ( 3x girl-girl , one solo bathtub ) , camera cuts away fades out just before you see any real action . if you've ever seen playboy soft-core stuff , you know exactly what i'm talking . i only hope unedited material finds it way video eventually , but i feeling it won't . here why : my third complaint whole dvd seems one long info-mercial [ ... ] . several times during video , ggw web address pops up screen , usually after disappointingly edited segments mentioned above . apparently , if you want see whole scene , you become member ggw website . plus , last ten minutes dvd just late-night commercials ( censored , boot ) they show tv . after all money they scammed me when i ordered dvds directly , i won't even buy their products new anymore . all-in-all , i'm extremely disappointed this dvd . if spring break 2005 uncensored dvd format ggw plans follow future , i'll never buy their products again	-1

there no reason why alan partridge couldn't popular us " office " ... however , bbcamerica insists burying show late-night , so it remains cult favorite . this dvd talk show " knowing me , knowing you " which isn't quite good later sitcom " i'm alan partridge " but it still brilliant . partridge ( played steve coogan ) great character , completely obnoxious , but you can't help but cheer him he annoys his guests until they beat him up . this set 6 episodes show , christmas special , lots extras , like commentary extended episodes . if you like modern british comedy like office/little britain/etc , you should pick this up ( even if you haven't seen it due bbcamerica bad scheduling ) . it worth paying 20 bucks see something decent tv	1

everyone gone insane ? english teacher who taught this novel couple years , i looking little something more faithful novel than original version . hah ! this piece trash worst version classic novel i've seen 20 years teaching . there approximately three moments movie actually text , i'm sure purely accidental . monster gangster , frankenstein looks like one spartans 300 , elizabeth deranged emo , clerval relegated role idiotic womanizer . when credits rolled end i saw branagh directed this film ( he who created most watchable , beautiful , textually accurate version hamlet ever ) , i thought i may well burn myself funeral pyre ( one few textually accurate details this horror film ) . here deal - don't waste your time . read book . byron shelley right - mary somehting going this story - too bad branagh forgot read it	-1
" happiness " movie basically irony everything movie ironic ... including title . no one this movie happy , not even characters who think they . once movie over , you probably won't overwhelmed happiness either . this not happy movie ... although it pretty funny , sick demented way . but i think review cover sums up film nicely ; " deeply disturbing shockingly funny . " this movie some most disturbing sometimes disgusting scenes i've seen movie long time . movie centers around three sisters ; joy ( jane adams ) , helen ( lara flynn boyle ) , trish ( cynthia stevenson ) jordan . although almost all characters film kind circle back these three sisters , they're not really main characters . movie opens joy dinner date man named andy ( jon lovitz ) . andy looks distraught joy tells him it not going work out . what i think one funniest awkward scenes movie i've seen recently , adam gives her limited edition goldplated ashtray then takes it away tells her he saving it girl who truly loves him . credit sequence promptly follows . then we suddenly meet man named allen ( oscar winner philip seymour hoffman ) who explains his therapist bill maplewood ( dylan baker , ' head state ' ) he sexual fantasties his next door neighbor , who just happens helen . bill also happens married trish . ironic . allen begins series calls helen , telling her graphic detail what he thinks her before more irony begins pouring . meanwhile , we learn it seems trish only happy one this trio sisters ... she seems perfect life ; three kids good husband . but bill hiding something well , perverted fascination little boys . really disturbing scenes become this fascination . there also subplot sister parents ( louise lasser ben gazzarra ) who splitting up ; camryn manheim ( former abc tv show ' apprentice ' ) who plays neighbor allen who also hiding secret . now , i expected love " happiness " some reason ; even though i knew hardly anything plot . but , i didn't love ... i liked it , but i didn't love it . it very unique movie it definitely funny ; but i thought most interesting aspect movie one you see least . allen , played so well hoffman , could've subject his own film . don't get me wrong , i don't think they should've gotten rid rest story but i think they should payed more attention this character . besides story , there other good things it . dialogue very smart there some classic lines this movie . conversations bill his son very creepy though . case , this hasn't made clear . this movie not everybody ; many people may find it sick immoral , especially since it seems nothing really bad happens bill despite his wrongdoings . but filmbuffs appreciate it , but mature audiences must . grade : b+	-1

recently i saw reservoir dogs first time since ' 90 , struck how perfect , just dead-on flawless , quentin tarantino writing this edge-of-your nerves movie . it says something somehow reservoir dogs seemed far less violent me today than i remembered high school , i think signifies lot how far violence pervaded media well entertainment industry ( which increasingly one same , aren't they ? ) . those who don't know , this possessingly intricate story , told flashback/flash forward/non-linear style tells gang would-be jewelry store robbers hired crime boss his son commit fast ( " out two minutes no matter what " ) heist downtown los angeles one lackluster morning . unknown each other , these specialists various corners nation assigned names like " mr. blond " " mr. white " " mr. blue " " mr. pink " " mr. orange " etc . given precise instructions never give out any real information themselves they go securing cache diamonds recently imported israel . classic tarantino fashion all goes wrong it possibly , police intervene , blood spurts , gunfire cracks like thunder innocent lives horribly lost , what began amid laid-back breakfast laced rapid-fire profanity cerebral analysis madonna's`80 anthem " like virgin " suddenly shifts second act warehouse which remnants crew assemble , each paranoically aware one among them police informer . but who it ? even audience doesn't know till after it sat dismay through one more gruesome torture sequences ever caught celluloid . first couple times you see this great classic , you'll dazed , but sooner or later it'll hit you , it me , screenplay reservoir dogs might some best writing ever hollywood . owning it dvd best way take all easy miss twists turns not only plot but adrenaline-propelled dialogue . five stars	1

following arthur penn 1967 hit `bonnie clyde , ' hollywood enjoyed brief fling depression-era gangsters . free-wheeling woodstock generation found something like anti-establishment , anti-authoritarian , legendary outlaws their parents ' youth . legendary bank robber john dillinger certainly fit bill . john milius dillinger we meet title character , played warren oates , height his career . john dillinger notorious character enough wit recognize he doing rubes favor , sorts , every time he holds up bank . it gives those robbed something talk remember . anyway , dillinger seemingly relies efficient professionalism over firepower . least he don't shoot lessen he shot , which sight better than gun happy thug baby face nelson ( richard dreyfuss , ) who joins gang mid-movie . , such things measured back then , probably better than what we get dillinger hunting alpha g-man melvin purvis ( ben johnson ) . we get awful lot purvis this movie - he supplies periodic voice over narration gets equal screen time oates . milius would write teleplay 1974 `melvin purvis , g-man , ' which starred gruff voiced character action , dale robertson . parallel story telling works well enough , although dillinger gets lost time or two . we get tag purvis few times when he big showdown public enemies , they're very well handled . depression , which figured prominently social setting explanation do-badders , set deep background isn't much factor . dillinger , he tells his girlfriend/common law wife billie frechette ( michelle phillips , her debut , ) just always wanted bank robber , . towards end story fall apart bit . dillinger disappears completely last act , which dominated purvis negotiations lady red ( cloris leachman anna sage , madam who arranged dillinger capture outside movie house chicago . ) besides john dillinger , milius either scripted , directed , or both movies geronimo , teddy roosevelt , jeremiah johnson judge roy bean . legendary americans all , milius very much `print legend ' director . sometimes you get feeling if it doesn't lend itself photo op milius isn't much interested it . it makes good action flicks , shaky history lessons , frustration those who like character development . johnson ( good actor ) oates ( very good actor ) make their characters more compelling than written . after big shootout ( excitingly recreated movie ) his flight chicago dillinger life kind fell apart . he'd separated billie underwent plastic surgery . perhaps because he thought plastic surgery might confuse audience - perhaps - milius decided ignore dillinger chicago , save purvis plot capture him . heck , i would happy whole movie , starring oates , course , dillinger chicago . probably best suited gangster movie fans , or fans ben johnson warren oates .	-1

my experience , seeing words " national lampoon " any film title bad omen , indicating tastelessness dearth actual comedy up ahead . national lampoon gold diggers manages take series all-time low - which , sadly , no mean feat . friedle chris owen act if they auditioning future installment dumb dumber , plot suffers definite " ick " factor - , sadly , those actually movie strengths . calvin ( friedle ) leonard ( owen ) grew up together orphanage now trying make their mark world young adults . they certainly don't want work living , so they take up life petty crime . they pitiful failures this wind up jail . then , two old ladies they accosted street bail them out invite them visit their impressive home . guys ( which i mean calvin , he only one really capable actual human thought ) think their hosts rich , so it they devise plan marry them , wait their imminent deaths , then live large their inheritances . doris ( louise lasser ) betty mundt ( renee taylor ) may heirs mundt prophylactics fortune , but they fact cash poor ( thanks their insane uncle , who charge mundt estate ) . they make their own plans marry two young men , purchase sizable insurance policies them , then kill them . double wedding takes place , marriages consummated ( i hear yuck !? ) , month passes . calvin finds married life buxom , not-dead-yet doris driving him insane , so he leonard begin setting " accidental " traps their wives ; naturally , women finalizing their own murder plans same time . mr. mrs. smith , this ain't - but goes without saying . i won't lie say i didn't laugh or smile time or two because i , but national lampoon gold diggers aims low - really low - cannot begin escape black hole stupidity upon which it built . i think i speak vast majority human beings when i say we just don't want see senior citizen women prancing around onscreen like victoria secret models . there crude then there national lampoon crude , gold diggers crude it gets . this film should all rights career killer anyone involved it - although nikki ziering may emerge relatively unscathed given fact her screen time severely limited	-1

ivan reitman 1984 mega-hit , it lesser sequel , both included this double feature dvd gift set long time fans ghostbusters should consider absolute must own . chances you already know story : three bumbling scientists ( bill murray , dan aykroyd , harold ramis ) lose their campus jobs go into business themselves . only thing , their business involves capturing containing gross slimy ghosts throughout new york . also featuring sigourney weaver , ernie hudson , rick moranis ; ghostbusters ended up super hit which spawned animated series , tons toys , sequel five years later . ghostbusters 2 , while nowhere near wonderful first film but still pretty fun , finds guys back business new breed evil birthed time new years . although this isn't first time both films appeared dvd , there enough special features here make this gift set worth picking up . there nice selection deleted scenes ( nothing substancial ) , couple featurettes , commentary reitman co ., but there no features devoted ghostbusters 2 . instead , there two animated episodes linked two films , there exclusive scrap book included too nice variety information fans . if you've already double dipped ghostbusters dvd , picking this up entirely up you . however , if you're fan these films don't own them dvd , pick this affordable gift set up enjoy	1

this movie might perfect example how audiences react more " famous " names more " superficial " " commercial " movies ... this movie unfortunate come out nearly same time more popular " dangerous liasons " featuring more stars ... i've seen movie many times television , i admit it good entertainment , but it never really made me crazy . , personally , stars doesn't mean great actors , most cases ... not long ago valmont shown television , both read book seen two movie versions it ( " dangerous liaisons " old french version jeanne moreau ) i very curious see what this one would offer ... me , i've never seen better valmont or better marquise ... whole cast great . that what i call good acting directing ... i haven't seen all colin firth movies , but i definetely say it must one his best performances ever ... watching him act valmont simple delicious ! comparing not always good thing , but this movie more luxurious more " serious " than " dangerous liaisons " great acting adds great result ; much classier version . if one seduced some aging not-so-attractive malkovich close , well , each his own taste ... i don't consider pfeiffer thurman great actresses . i'm sure i won't able convince everyone valmont much more subtle full-of-finesse performances , even though it not perfect copy book , it closest spirit meaning . worth your time !	1
" daughters dust " truly cinematic feast eyes , one savored slowly , metaphorically taking sips it if it bottle some elegant vintage wine . those expecting fast-paced narrative drama most surely disappointed , since film slowly takes us through final days gullah family life sea islands north carolina georgia , shortly before most family treks north new , promised life bereft time-honored gullah traditions . filmmaker - screenwriter - julie dash rendered beguiling look peazant family past present , seen through eyes matriarch nana peazant ( cora lee day extremely rich , intense performance , that truly one best ensemble cast fine performances . ) . there ample attention paid african folk wisdom culture , demonstrating rich cultural heritage sea islands ' gullah people , peazant family ponders its future one final family gathering . cinematographer arthur jafa camera recorded this saga visually sumptuous imagery sincerely respectful gullah traditions affectionately pays homage them . dash wonderful film must surely rank one most intriguing cinematic debuts american cinema , hopefully pointing way new generation afro-american filmmakers others interested her unique , almost existentalist , means cinematic storytelling ( i might add too i pleasure hearing ms. dash discuss her film here new york city few days ago ; it delightful , inspiring discussion which both emotionally intellectually quite rewarding . i might add too , i pleasure speaking her afterwards , discovering we mutual admirers splendid fiction octavia butler , whose unexpected passing last year deprived both afro-american literature literary science fiction one their most thoughtful , eloquent voices . )	1

i don't know how ride motorcycle ( i'm car guy ) . i've never watched motogp tv . i can't tell honda yamaha if placed front me . yet , i simply totally captivated this dvd . i admit i enjoy ewan mcgregor movies , i especially enjoyed ' long way round ' . this guy who seemed know what he doing , so it basis this ( my rather bored one day ) i bought this dvd . i didn't know what expect . but i tell you now : it better than anything i could imagined . basically , this documentary following people events during two seasons motogp . cast characters colorful . there rock-star-like veteran , meteoric challenger , likeable everyman plagued bad luck , young rookie , mad doctor looking after whole flock . documentary takes sympathetic look these guys , charting their ups downs over 2 tumultuous seasons furious racing pain-staking preparations . battles them track riveting dramatic . full dirty tricks , bitter mindgames , hot-blooded racing multiple overtaking maneuvers . think all racing movies you've ever watched ( le mans , days thunder , driven etc etc ) - this beats them all wide margin terms drama tension ... it all real life ! after this , you'll probably never thrilled f1 , indy , nascar or any race 4 wheels ever again - where you'll lucky get one breath-taking overtaking move per race , not several per lap motogp . this documentary really remarkable access all big stars sport . heroes , prima-donnas , hotshot rookies all open themselves camera . they all turn out charismatic , genuine ' human ' individuals . any movie screenplay would struggle depict characters instantly sympathetic this bunch bikers . you simply cannot imagine schumacher , alonso co formula 1 doing dvd like this - where you viewer get up close ride them . magic . only thing comparable my experience would ' metallica : some kind monster ' documentary - terms close , personal access mega-stars film-makers . race footage brilliant , matched decent soundtrack . watching races ( albeit highlights only ) enough get pulse rate up . film-makers good job keeping pace film running just right . thrash-speed races intercut well more introspective looks invidual riders . nice job . dvd offers good extras . ability follow key laps key races any one key riders interesting touch . it allows viewer see exactly how race won or lost perspective each protagonist . but best extra all ' sequel ' documentary , following riders next two seasons . after exhilirating film like this , you don't want it just end like - you keep wanting know what happens next . me , that mark successful film . well , you see i liked this film . watching it not spurred me get motorbike licence ( i still prefer my turbo 4wd car ) , but it excited me enough i'll tuning motogp this season . you don't bike fan enjoy this dvd ( i wasn't ) . i would recommend it anyone who : - enjoys real-life drama ( actually melodrama ! ) - enjoys good documentary film-making - or simply bit ' speed ' their bloo	1
